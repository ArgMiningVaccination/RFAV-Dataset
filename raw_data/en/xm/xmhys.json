Governed by the World Trade Organization (WTO), which came into existence in 1995 and which builds on and extends the principles of its twentieth century predecessor agreement, the General Agreement on Tari\u00a4s and Trade (GATT), this system of global trade rules is facing a growing list of twenty- rst century challenges that include the rise of large emerging markets led by China, accommodating e\u00a4orts to address climate change, the growing importance of digital trade, the rise of o\u00a4shoring and global value chains, and the push for regulatory harmonization as an end in itself. These challenges re\u0087 ect changes in the global economy that have occurred in recent decades, and they raise questions about the legitimacy of the GATT/WTO as the arbiter of global trade rules. Is the WTO, an institution that has traditionally been about \u0093shallow integration\u0094with a focus on trade impediments imposed at the border rather than on \u0093deep integration\u0094that results from direct negotiations over behind-the-border measures, capable of meeting these challenges? Or do we need a new global trade order for the twenty- rst century? In this book I address these questions, and I argue that the best hope for cre- ating an e\u00a4ective world trading system for the twenty- rst century is to build on the foundations of the world trading system of the twentieth century. I construct this argument in two steps, rst, by developing an understanding of why GATT worked and the economic environment it is best suited for (Part I), and second, by evaluating according to this understanding whether the changes in the global economy that have occurred in recent decades imply the need for changes in the design of the GATT/WTO (Part II). Throughout I adopt the view that design should re\u0087 ect purpose, and that identifying the fundamental purpose of a trade agreement in a given economic environment \u0096that is, what problem the agree- ment should solve for the member governments \u0096is essential to understanding its appropriate design in that environment. Building on these steps, I argue that the terms-of-trade theory of trade agreements provides a compelling framework for understanding the purpose of a trade agreement in the twentieth century and the success of GATT, and I argue that according to this understanding the logic of GATT\u0092 s design features transcend many, though not all, of the current challenges faced by the WTO (Part III). Two overarching themes emerge from the research that I describe in this book. A rst theme is this: trade agreements that lack deep-integration provisions are not necessarily \u0093weak\u0094agreements; and by the same token, those trade agreements iiithat contain the most developed deep-integration provisions should not necessarily be seen as the \u0093gold standard.\u0094 Indeed I will argue that where the terms-of- trade theory is applicable the opposite may be closer to the truth, as shallow- integration agreements then hold out the possibility that countries could reach the international e\u00a2 ciency frontier without sacri cing national sovereignty. A second theme is more subtle. To a rst order, when it comes to trade agree- ments it could be said that the primary task of national governments during the GATT era was to dismantle the excessively high trade barriers of the large indus- trialized countries, and to move the world from a starting point far away from the international e\u00a2 ciency frontier to a position on the frontier \u0096or in the language of the terms-of-trade theory, to escape from a terms-of-trade driven prisoner\u0092 s dilemma; and by the end of the twentieth century much, though not all, of this task had been completed. For the twenty- rst century by contrast it could be argued that while in many ways the fundamental problem for trade agreements to solve has not changed, the primary task for the WTO has shifted, away from helping governments traverse to the e\u00a2 ciency frontier, and toward providing them with the \u0087 exibility they need to remain on the frontier in the face of various shocks to the world trading system, including the rise of China and the large emerging economies, the digitalization of trade, and the rising threat of climate change; and for this era the capabilities of countries to rebalance and renegotiate their commit- ments within the GATT/WTO framework is likely to become paramount to the WTO\u0092 s success. I argue that in principle the GATT/WTO is as well-equipped for this second task as the GATT proved to be for the rst task. And while the rise of o\u00a4shoring and global value chains, and the push for regulatory harmonization as an end in itself, may re\u0087 ect a change in the purpose of trade agreements and therefore present more fundamental challenges to the GATT/WTO approach, I argue that there is still a strong case for building on the GATT/WTO foundation to address these particular twenty- rst century problems where they arise. In short, the message of this book can be summarized as follows: The best advice for designing a world trading system for the twenty- rst century may not be Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg\u0092 s famous motto \u0093Move fast and break things,\u0094but rather Britain\u0092 s now-ubiquitous war-time slogan from World War II, Keep Calm and Carry On. With this advice I am not claiming that reforms to the world trading system are not needed, or that all is well at the WTO. But I am claiming that the basic architecture of the GATT/WTO \u0096and of the GATT, in particular \u0096is well-suited to guide the design of the world trading system of the twenty- rst century. ivPart I and portions of Part II of this book are based largely on my 2016 Ohlin Lectures, September 27-28, Stockholm. Some readers may notice that this book is larger and longer than other books in the Ohlin Lectures series. This is because while the themes of my Ohlin Lectures are the themes of this book, the intervening ve years between those lectures and my writing of this book have allowed me to investigate various aspects of those themes in greater detail, and providing coverage of that additional research in this book has added substantially to the book that I would have written in 2016. Having described for readers what this book is, it is equally important to be clear about what this book is not. It is not a synthesis of the broader literature on trade agreements; instead, as it is built around my Ohlin Lectures, it is narrowly focused on my own work (mostly with coauthors). And it is not a book about United States trade policy or the trade policy of any other country for the twenty- rst century; rather, it is about whether or not the existing multilateral trade rules can provide an environment where countries with heterogeneous tastes and circumstances can best choose their trade policies to achieve their objectives in the twenty- rst century global economy. While writing this book I have bene ted from the input of many people. I thank Jim Anderson, Emily Blanchard, Davin Chor, Caroline Freund, Matthew Grant, and seminar participants at the WTO for many helpful comments and discussions, and the 2021 class of Fellows at Stanford\u0092 s Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (CASBS) for helpful feedback. I am particularly grateful to Kyle Bagwell, Chad Bown, Henrik Horn, Bob Keohane, Michele Ruta, Alan Sykes and several anonymous reviewers for detailed comments. I am also grateful to CASBS for providing a productive atmosphere, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, during the period over which this book was drafted. Win- ston Chen and Paul Hager provided outstanding research assistance during the preparation of this book. And of course, I am grateful to those at the Stockholm School of Economics who hosted me during my Ohlin Lectures and provided the impetus for writing this book. v1. Introduction Individuals are the ultimate drivers of globalization, but governments set the rules of the game. And the rules can be very important to the outcome. This book is about the rules that guided the global economy of the twentieth century, how those rules came about, the logic of their design, their successes and failures, and whether they are adequate for the twenty- rst century. My focus is on the World Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO \u0096and before it, its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tari\u00a4s and Trade (GATT) \u0096 is where governments come to agree on the rules of globalization, or at least the multilateral rules that apply to all 164member countries and their preferential trade agreements. These rules solve problems that would arise under \u0093the law of the jungle,\u0094and they de ne the constitution of the global trade order. The GATT/WTO is \u0093member-driven,\u0094accepting the sovereign right of each country to de ne its policy preferences, and seeking mutually advantageous trade liberalization as judged by the member governments. As an institution, the GATT/WTO has traditionally been about \u0093shallow integration,\u0094with a focus on negotiations to reduce tari\u00a4s and other trade impediments imposed at the border rather than on direct negotiations over behind-the-border measures. And it has been very successful, hosting eight rounds of multilateral negotiations beginning with the rst GATT (Geneva) Round of 1947 and culminating in the Uruguay Round which created the WTO in 1995. The commitments made in these GATT rounds helped to dismantle the web of highly restrictive trade protections that had been erected in the 1920\u0092 s and 30\u0092 s, and ushered in a wave of globalization over the next 60years that transformed the world economy. By the time the results of the Uruguay Round had been fully implemented, average tari\u00a4s on industrial goods had been reduced to below 4%on an ad valorem basis and quantitative restrictions were largely eliminated (WTO, 2007, Bown and Crowley, 2016). But during the last several decades the ground has shifted, and the WTO\u0092 s Doha Round, begun in 2001 and now suspended, has disappointed. Two changes to the world economy stand out as emblematic of this shifting landscape. First, the latest wave of globalization has brought the large emerging and developing economies, led by China, from the background of the world economy to its forefront. Figure 1.1 illustrates this reversal of relative importance by GDP. In 1980 the emerging and developing economies accounted for 37percent of the share of world GDP, with advanced economies making up the remaining 63percent. By 2007 these shares were 50=50, and today the share of the world\u0092 s GDP captured 1by emerging and developing countries is approaching 60percent. Figure 1.1 (Source: IMF World Economic Outlook, October 2017) And second, with the rise of o\u00a4shoring and global supply chains, this latest wave of globalization has also changed the nature of trade itself. In the early years of GATT, international trade amounted to the international exchange of nished or largely nished goods. Today much of international trade consists of the movement of parts and components and associated services from one country to another and back again for assembly, as exempli ed by the sourcing decisions involved in the production of the Boeing Dreamliner illustrated in Figure 1.2. Figure 1.2 (Source: Boeing; Reuters/Business Insider) Against this backdrop, multilateralism is stumbling, and with it the WTO, whose legitimacy is being questioned as never before. Of course, the world has also 2just experienced four years of Trade in the Trump era, marked by the provoca- tive and ubiquitous Trump Trade tweets, of which below is but one example. . But the challenges faced by multilateralism in general and the WTO in particular are about something much more sub- tle \u0096and far bigger \u0096than Trump. Recent decades have witnessed a clear evolution away from the shallow approach to integration pioneered by GATT, and toward a preference for \u0093deep\u0094integration with a focus on the trade e\u00a4ects of regulations and other behind- the-border measures and increasingly with the goal of regu- latory harmonization as an end in itself, as exempli ed by re- gional and mega-regional negotiations (some ongoing, some completed, some failed) over the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agree- ment (CETA), and the Trans Paci c Partnership (TPP);1and to a lesser extent this evolution can be seen in the transition from GATT to the WTO. China\u0092 s entry into the world trading system, formalized with its 2001 accession to the WTO, has challenged an approach to globalization that was designed fundamen- tally with market economies in mind. More recently the increasing importance of digital trade has made WTO rules, crafted in a largely pre-digital world, look out of date; and the world has witnessed a strong backlash within many countries against globalization itself, from those who have not shared in the gains, and from those who feel that the sovereignty of their governments has been eroded. Beyond these direct challenges, the increasing urgency of addressing climate change raises questions about the role that the WTO should play in this e\u00a4ort. In the face of all these challenges, is multilateralism dead? In this book I argue that the prognosis for multilateralism is not as dire as that, though I will suggest that the multilateralism the world has experienced over the past 75years may be unusual, and that multilateralism may now be entering a period of hibernation until more favorable conditions for its ascendancy once again return. Do we need a new global trade order for the twenty- rst century? That is di\u00a2 cult to say. But what seems clear is this: meeting globalization\u0092 s challenges in the twenty- rst century will require a nuanced response capable of addressing multilateralism\u0092 s current shortcomings, and to succeed we need a correct diagnosis of those shortcomings. For such a diagnosis, it is imperative to understand why 1See Ho\u00a4man, Osnago and Ruta (2017) for a database on the provisions contained in these kinds of agreements. 3GATT worked, the economic environment it is best suited for, and whether the changes in the economic environment in recent decades imply the need for changes in the design of the GATT/WTO, or possibly a new approach to trade agreements altogether, or rather simply better use of the agreements already in place. It is such an understanding that I attempt to provide in this book. What\u0092 s at stake? The future path of globalization is at stake. Which interna- tional institutions will set the rules of globalization is at stake. What trade-o\u00a4s we will face in our globalized world is at stake. In short, the stakes of getting this right are very high. In the rest of this chapter I sketch in broad and intuitive terms the main themes that I will develop in greater detail in the rest of the book. While later chapters provide the technical detail necessary for the formal arguments that underpin many of the statements that I make in the book, my intent here is to provide an overview of these themes at a level that would be accessible to anyone with an un- dergraduate Econ 1 background.2As such, there are no equations in this chapter, and there is nothing beyond the bare minimum in terms of formal notation. Nor have I included in this chapter the quali cations that a careful treatment would demand or citations to the relevant literature (beyond citations for a reproduced gure or quotation): those too will come in later chapters. Instead, this chapter is composed only of words, graphs and a few plots of data to convey the main ideas. Readers uninterested in material developed in this way my wish to skim the rest of this chapter or skip on to chapter 2. 1.1. A Roadmap for the Book I start with a key point: from the perspective of economics, the legitimacy of the WTO as an international institution is not built on the case for free trade; rather, it is built on the case for internalizing negative international policy externalities. This is an important point, because the case for free trade, while one of the most powerful insights in all of economics, relies on a set of special assumptions which are unlikely to hold in the real world across the WTO\u0092 s diverse membership; and the case for internalizing negative externalities is far more general by comparison. The purpose of a trade agreement To explain this point in simple terms, I begin here with the basics of industry-level supply and demand analysis in a 2Indeed, the material in section 1.1 comes from a pair of public lectures I gave in Calgary (the 2018 Dr. Frank Anton Distinguished Lecture) and Turin (the 2018 Luca d\u0092 Agliano Lecture). 4closed economy. This is reproduced in Figure 1.3, which with the quantity of goodameasured on the horizontal axis and its price measured on the vertical axis, . Figure 1.3depicts a downward-sloping demand curve labeledDaand an upward sloping supply curve labeled Sawhose intersection deter- mines the market-clearing price of good a in the closed economy, labeled p0 a. Also de- picted in Figure 1.3 is the standard mea- sure of economic welfare generated by this industry: the sum of consumer surplus (the area below the demand curve and above the market-clearing price) and producer surplus (the area above the supply curve and below the market-clearing price). Suppose now that this country opens up to trade, and in particular that it is a small open economy trading freely with the world at a world price for good athat is below the closed-economy price p0 a depicted in Figure 1.3. This situation is depicted in the two panels of Figure 1.4. Figure 1.4 The left panel of Figure 1.4 displays the same information as Figure 1.3 \u0096that is, the country\u0092 s demand and supply curves for good a\u0096but now with the lower price for good athat prevails in the country under free trade, pFT a. As the left panel depicts, at this lower free-trade price the economy\u0092 s quantity demanded for goodaincreases (we move down the downward-sloping demand curve) and its 5quantity supplied of good adecreases (we move down the upward-sloping supply curve), and the economy makes up its shortfall of supply relative to demand at the free-trade price by importing the di\u00a4erence, Ma, from the rest of the world. And at this lower free-trade price, the economy\u0092 s consumer surplus has increased and its producer surplus has decreased relative to the closed-economy magnitudes depicted in Figure 1.3, resulting in the net increase in consumer-plus-producer surplus depicted by the shaded triangle in the left panel of Figure 1.4 and labeled \u0093gains from trade.\u0094This is the classic welfare gain from free trade that is taught in every introductory economics course. The right panel of Figure 1.4 packages this information in a more compact form. This panel depicts the country\u0092 s downward sloping import demand curve (its quantity demanded minus its quantity supplied), labeled as Ma; and it depicts the foreign export supply curve that this small country faces, labeled as E\u0003 a, which is horizontal (in nitely elastic) at the world price p\u0003 aearned by foreign exporters. The gains from free trade are given in this panel by the shaded area under the country\u0092 s import demand curve and above the world price. Finally, notice that the country\u0092 s price of good adepicted in the left panel of Figure 1.4, pFT a, is the same as the world price depicted in the right panel of Figure 1.4, p\u0003 a, re\u0087 ecting the fact that in Figure 1.4 the country trades freely in good awith the world. Now suppose that this country places a tari\u00a4 aon its imports of good a. This will not alter the world price of good a,p\u0003 a, owing to the small size of the country under consideration and the fact that it is therefore a price taker on world markets. But the tari\u00a4 will raise the domestic price of good ato a price above pFT a, sayp1 a, and the implications are depicted in the three panels of Figure 1.5. The top left panel of Figure 1.5 depicts the changes in welfare that are brought about by the imposition of the tari\u00a4. Because the tari\u00a4 has increased the domestic price ofa, consumer surplus in the economy is reduced, from the area below the demand curve and above the free-trade price pFT ato the smaller area below the demand curve and above the higher, tari\u00a4-distorted, price p1 a. By itself this reduction in consumer surplus is unambiguously bad for the country. But there are two o\u00a4setting e\u00a4ects that also need to be considered. First, producer surplus rises with the higher domestic price of a, from the area above the supply curve and below the free-trade price pFT ato the area above the supply curve and below the tari\u00a4-distorted price p1 a: the implied redistribution of surplus from domestic consumers to domestic producers in industry ais given by the shaded trapezoid in the top left panel of Figure 1.5. Depending on how the country feels about this redistribution (e.g., is it worth it to have consumers pay 6higher prices for good aand give up some consumer surplus so that producers of goodacan earn higher incomes, assuming that a better way to help producers of goodacannot be found?), it could be either a good thing for the country or a bad thing, or neutral. And second, some of the lost consumer surplus is converted into tari\u00a4 revenue: the implied conversion of consumer surplus into tari\u00a4 revenue is given by the shaded rectangle (with dimensions a\u0002Ma) in the top left panel of Figure 1.5. Depending on how the country feels about the conversion of consumer surplus into tari\u00a4 revenue (e.g., is it worth it to have consumers pay higher prices for goodaso that tari\u00a4 revenue can be collected to fund the provision of public goods, assuming that a better way to fund government services cannot be found?), this could also be either a good thing for the country or a bad thing, or neutral. Figure 1.5 Finally, there isa portion of the lost consumer surplus that simply disappears, as measured by the two triangles of shaded area in Figure 1.5: this is the \u0093dead- weight\u0094 e\u00a2 ciency loss associated with the tari\u00a4, and it forms the crux of the 7economist\u0092 s case for free trade. If the redistributions of surplus caused by the tari\u00a4 that I have described above are not valued by the country \u0096that is, if consumer surplus, producer surplus and tari\u00a4 revenue are all valued by the country in the same way, so that their distribution across these three components is irrelevant to the country\u0092 s overall welfare \u0096then all that the country has accomplished with a tari\u00a4 is to create dead-weight e\u00a2 ciency loss and thereby hurt itself by reducing its gains from free trade. This case can be seen directly from the top right- hand panel of Figure 1.5, where the shaded triangle represents the lost gains from trade associated with the imposition of the tari\u00a4, with the shaded trapezoid then representing the (smaller) gains from trade that remain. In this case, it is clear that free trade would be the best (welfare maximizing) policy for the country. On the other hand, if the country does value the redistribution of surplus it has orchestrated with its tari\u00a4, then the size of the shaded trapezoid depicted in the top right panel of Figure 1.5 understates the value of the country\u0092 s gains from trade under the tari\u00a4, because it overstates the value to the country of the lost consumer surplus and understates the value to the country of the gains in producer surplus and/or tari\u00a4 revenue. In this case, as a result of this redistribution the welfare that the country experiences with the tari\u00a4 could then be larger than the welfare that it experiences under free trade. The upshot is that the country may gain from a tari\u00a4 via the redistributive impacts of the tari\u00a4 that I have described above, but there is also an e\u00a2 ciency cost that has to be weighed against any such gain. This trade-o\u00a4 is depicted in the bottom panel of Figure 1.5, which displays the domestic price of good aon the horizontal axis and the marginal bene t and marginal cost to the country of a higher tari\u00a4 \u0096and therefore of a higher domestic price of good a\u0096on the vertical axis. As depicted, the marginal cost of the tari\u00a4 is increasing as the tari\u00a4 rises above free trade (zero) and the domestic price parises above the free-trade price pFT a=p\u0003 a, re\u0087 ecting the increasing size of the dead-weight loss triangles depicted in the top panels of Figure 1.5 that would occur as the tari\u00a4 (and hence the domestic price of good a) is increased. And in this bottom panel I have illustrated the case where the country does indeed value the redistribution of surplus triggered by its tari\u00a4 but does so at a decreasing rate, which then implies that the marginal bene t of the tari\u00a4 starts out at a strictly positive level and declines as the tari\u00a4 is raised to higher levels. The optimal tari\u00a4 choice for this country is determined where the marginal bene t curve crosses the marginal cost curve in the bottom panel of Figure 1.5, and I have labeled this tari\u00a4 choice small ato re\u0087 ect the fact that I am considering here a country that is small in world markets. 8I now come to a crucial observation: if it is accepted that each country has the sovereign right to de ne its own preferences over its policy choices, and if the country under consideration chooses the tari\u00a4 small aunilaterally as I have depicted this choice in the bottom panel of Figure 1.5, and if all other countries of the world are also small in world markets and make analogous unilateral tari\u00a4 choices given their policy preferences, then these tari\u00a4 choices will be internationally e\u00a2 cient relative to the policy preferences of each country, and there is nothing for a trade agreement to do! This is because, as Figure 1.5 re\u0087 ects for the country under consideration, each country will have then set its tari\u00a4 at a level where the marginal bene t to the country of a slightly higher tari\u00a4 would be just o\u00a4set by the marginal cost to the country of a slightly higher tari\u00a4. And owing to the fact that the country is small on world markets so that its tari\u00a4 choice does not impact the world price p\u0003 a, the tari\u00a4revenue associated with small awill be collected entirely from the country\u0092 s own consumers who face higher domestic prices, not from foreign exporters. As a consequence, there are no bene ts or costs of the country\u0092 s slightly higher tari\u00a4 that would be borne by the rest of the world \u0096and hence no international externalities associated with its tari\u00a4 choice \u0096ensuring that each country\u0092 s unilaterally optimal tari\u00a4 choice will then also be optimal from the point of view of the world as a whole. Evidently, the world I have just described could be riddled with tari\u00a4s, and yet there is nothing that a trade agreement could \u0096or should \u0096do about this. What, then, is the purpose of the trade agreements that we observe? One possibility is that, while countries have the sovereign right to de ne their own policy preferences, they may have di\u00a2 culty committing to policies that re\u0087 ect these preferences, and they might then seek trade agreements as external commitment devices to help them avoid the temptation to choose trade protection. I will return to this possibility at several points in later chapters. But there is another possibility that becomes apparent once an assumption that I have thus far maintained is relaxed, namely, the assumption that the country under consideration is small in world markets. To illustrate, I now revisit this country\u0092 s unilateral tari\u00a4 choice, but under the assumption that the country is large in world markets. This is illustrated in Figure 1.6. The key di\u00a4erence between the large-country tari\u00a4 choice depicted in Figure 1.6 and the small-country tari\u00a4 choice in Figure 1.5 can be seen by comparing the top right panels of each gure: the foreign export supply curve E\u0003 ais horizontal in Figure 1.5 but it is upward sloping in Figure 1.6, re\u0087 ecting the fact that when the country under consideration is large it is not a price-taker on world markets, 9and its tari\u00a4 can therefore impact the world price p\u0003 a. Put di\u00a4erently, when the country under consideration is large, foreign exporters will accept a lower price p\u0003 a in the face of the country\u0092 s tari\u00a4 ain order to continue to sell into the country\u0092 s market. And this means that a portion of the tari\u00a4 revenue collected by the country is collected not from its own consumers, but from foreign exporters .3 Figure 1.6 The top right panel of Figure 1.6 depicts the drop in the world price to p\u00031 a that accompanies the increase in the country\u0092 s domestic price to p1 awhen the (now large) country imposes a tari\u00a4 taon imports of good a. The tari\u00a4revenue collected from foreign exporters corresponds to the shaded rectangle between the free-trade world price p\u0003 aand the lower world price p\u00031 athat prevails after the tari\u00a4 has been 3While the Trump Administration made a point of emphasizing the tari\u00a4 revenue it collected from foreigners with its trade actions, a number of recent studies have cast doubt on this claim, at least if the tari\u00a4s are in place for only a short period of time. I discuss the ndings of these studies in the context of the material presented in chapter 5. 10imposed: the di\u00a4erence between p\u0003 aandp\u00031 ais the amount of the tari\u00a4 that foreign exporters \u0093absorb\u0094via a price drop on each unit of good athat they export to this country. This tari\u00a4 revenue was not present in the small-country case depicted in Figure 1.5 \u0096because in the small-country case foreign exporters are unwilling to lower their price in order to maintain sales in the small-country market, hence the in nitely elastic foreign export supply curve that the small country faces \u0096 and the presence of this new source of tari\u00a4 revenue has a key implication: as the bottom panel of Figure 1.6 depicts, the tari\u00a4 revenue collected from foreign exporters o\u00a4sets to some degree the deadweight e\u00a2 ciency costs to the country associated with its tari\u00a4, shifting down the marginal cost curve for the tari\u00a4 of a large country relative to the marginal cost curve for a small country, and leading to the higher tari\u00a4 choice large a. As a result, and independent of the underlying policy preferences of countries, the tari\u00a4s chosen unilaterally by large countries are ine\u00a2 ciently high , and they are ine\u00a2 ciently high due to the negative international externality that is created when a large country suppresses foreign exporter prices with its tari\u00a4 increases, thereby shifting some of the costs of its tari\u00a4 onto foreign exporters. The purpose of a trade agreement is then to internalize these negative policy externalities, and thereby to reduce tari\u00a4s and expand trading opportunities. By addressing these ine\u00a2 ciencies, it is possible for all countries to gain as judged by their own policy preferences from the mutually bene cial expansion of trade. Clearly, the purpose of a trade agreement that I have outlined here \u0096and the expectation that trade agreements expand trade volumes that derives from this purpose \u0096has nothing to do with the case for free trade, since for my arguments to hold it is neither necessary nor su\u00a2 cient that countries accept that the case for free trade applies to them. But to be relevant, these arguments do require that countries have market power (in the form of monopsony power to depress foreign exporter prices) and use it when making trade policy choices outside the con nes of a trade agreement. Figure 1.7, reproduced from Broda, Limao and Weinstein (2008), provides striking support for this position (in later chapters I discuss empirical evidence on this and related issues more thoroughly). For15countries that were not at the time GATT/WTO members, Figure 1.7 plots the country\u0092 s median Harmonized System (HS) four-digit industry ad valorem tari\u00a4 level (vertical axis) against the median of a measure of the country\u0092 s market power across these four-digit industries (horizontal axis). The measure of market power is taken to be the inverse of the estimated industry-level foreign export supply elasticity faced by the country, with a truly small country who faces 11an in nitely elastic foreign export supply curve in an industry corresponding to a market power measure of zero. The fact that the 15country data points are spread out along the horizontal axis in Figure 1.7 over a range from 0:75to2:75 indicates that most countries, even seemingly \u0093small\u0094countries, possess signi cant market power in at least some industries. And the fact that Figure 1.7 displays a strong positive relationship between market power and the tari\u00a4 levels of the countries that wield it indicates that countries do indeed use their market power when setting tari\u00a4s outside of the con nes of a trade agreement. Figure 1.7 (Reproduced from Broda, Limao and Weinstein, 2008) The architecture of the GATT/WTO If the purpose of a trade agreement is to allow countries to internalize the negative international externalities of their trade policy choices, then the fundamental legitimacy of the GATT/WTO can be assessed with the answer to a single question: Is the GATT/WTO well-designed to serve this purpose? Generally, designing an e\u00a4ective institution to address an international exter- nality is exceedingly di\u00a2 cult (think climate change). But there is a particular structure to the international externality embodied in the arguments I have re- viewed above that makes this task more manageable in the case of a trade agree- ment, at least along some dimensions. The structure that I am referring to is this: the international externality that is created when a large country suppresses foreign exporter prices with its tari\u00a4 increases is a pecuniary externality, traveling through international prices and therefore markets . A pecuniary externality nor- mally does not create an ine\u00a2 ciency, but it does when it is combined with market 12power, which the large-country condition assures. And as this externality travels through markets, it can to some degree be shaped \u0096and in principle mitigated \u0096by speci c features of institutional design that serve to alter the transmission mechanism of the externality, a feat that would be far more di\u00a2 cult if not im- possible for international non-pecuniary externalities, such as those caused by an increase in the global carbon stock that are transmitted through the atmosphere. What are the key features of GATT/WTO design? And can these features be seen to mitigate the international policy externality at the core of the problem for a trade agreement to solve? The two pillars of the GATT/WTO architecture are non-discrimination and reciprocity. Non-discrimination requires that tari\u00a4s abide by the most-favored-nation (MFN) principle, according to which imports of the same product from di\u00a4erent countries face the same tari\u00a4 in a given market. Reci- procity refers to an ideal of balanced changes in tari\u00a4s across countries whereby, as a result of these tari\u00a4 changes, each country experiences a change in foreign access to its markets and implied import volume which is equivalent in value to the change in its access to foreign markets and implied export volume. In a multi-country world, the MFN principle helps to keep the structure of the international trade policy externality as simple as in a two-country world. To see why, consider the discussion above regarding the purpose of a trade agreement. One way to interpret this discussion is from the perspective of a two-country world, where the importing country under consideration imports good afrom a single foreign exporting country and imposes the tari\u00a4 aon imports of good afrom that country. But the discussion is equally valid when there are many foreign exporting countries, provided that the country under consideration abides by MFN and imposes a single tari\u00a4 aon imports of good aindependent of which foreign exporting country those imports come from, because in that case there is still just a single world price through which the international externality associated with the choice of awill travel. This simplicity would be destroyed in a multi- country world if the MFN principle did not apply, because with the importing country imposing discriminatory tari\u00a4s there would then be multiple world prices for gooda\u0096one for each foreign exporting country facing a distinct level of the tari\u00a4 on its exports of good ato the importing country \u0096and therefore multiple, distinct paths through which the international policy externality could travel. With MFN preserving the simple structure of the international trade policy externality described above, can reciprocity then be seen as a way to mitigate these externalities? At a basic level the answer is \u0093Yes.\u0094 This is because reciprocity de nes a measured , proportionate response to a country\u0092 s trade policy changes 13by its trading partners that keeps each country facing the trade-o\u00a4s of a small country , and thereby converts the logic of a large country\u0092 s unilateral tari\u00a4 choices depicted in Figure 1.6 into that of a small country as depicted in Figure 1.5. And for a member-driven institution, where what is important is not so much what policies are chosen by its members but rather howthose policies are chosen, this feature goes a long way to explaining the appeal of the design of the GATT/WTO for addressing the international policy externalities of its member countries. To see this, I return to the large-country tari\u00a4 choice depicted in Figure 1.6, but suppose now that the importing country under consideration understands that the foreign exporting country (or countries) will respond reciprocally to any tari\u00a4 change that it initiates. Figure 1.8 illustrates the implications of this anticipated reciprocal tari\u00a4 response from the foreign country. Figure 1.8 The new element in the top panels of Figure 1.8 relative to the top panels of Figure 1.6 is contained in the top right-most panel of Figure 1.8, which depicts a reciprocal tari\u00a4 response by the foreign country on a good bthat it imports from the country under consideration. This tari\u00a4 response is labeled in the gure as \u0003 b. The response is reciprocal , in that it corresponds to a measured, proportionate 14response to the tari\u00a4 aimposed by the importing country under consideration: and if calibrated to do so, the tari\u00a4 \u0003 bcan, for the foreign country, collect exactly the same amount of tari\u00a4 revenue from its trading partner\u0092 s exporters that its trading partner is collecting from its exporters with the tari\u00a4 a.4In Figure 1.8, this equivalence is re\u0087 ected by the fact that the area of the shaded rectangle in the top middle panel of Figure 1.8, which represents the tari\u00a4 revenue that the country under consideration collects from foreign exporters with its tari\u00a4 a, is equal to the area of the shaded rectangle in the top right-most panel of Figure 1.8, which represents the tari\u00a4 revenue that the foreign country collects from the exporters of the country under consideration with its reciprocal tari\u00a4 response \u0003 b. The implications of this tari\u00a4 response for the tari\u00a4 choice of the large im- porting country under consideration are depicted in the bottom panel of Figure 1.8. As shown there, the ability of this country to collect (net) tari\u00a4 revenue from foreign exporters \u0096which caused the downward shift in the marginal cost curve of the large country\u0092 s tari\u00a4 relative to that of a small importing country, and which led to the ine\u00a2 cient unilateral tari\u00a4 choices of the large country \u0096is neutralized by the reciprocal tari\u00a4 response of the foreign exporting country and the tari\u00a4 rev- enue it collects from the exporters of this country, with the result that the large importing country under consideration faces the trade-o\u00a4s of a small country and, like the small country, makes internationally e\u00a2 cient tari\u00a4 choices. In short, the legitimacy of the GATT/WTO as the multilateral institution that sets the rules of the global trade order can be defended on the grounds that its foundational principles of non-discrimination and reciprocity are designed to induce large countries to make the tari\u00a4 choices that they would make if they were small countries, and thereby to induce all countries to eliminate market power considerations from their tari\u00a4 choices. By serving this function, it can be argued that the GATT/WTO helps its member governments solve the fundamental trade agreement problem and achieve the international e\u00a2 ciency frontier. If the GATT/WTO serves this function, then the tari\u00a4 cuts that countries agree to when they join the WTO should re\u0087 ect these market power considera- tions, with larger tari\u00a4 cuts occurring where market power is high. Figure 1.9, reproduced from Bagwell and Staiger (2011), provides support for this position, focussing on ve countries that joined the WTO subsequent to its creation in 1995 (I discuss the ndings of this paper in greater detail in chapter 3). In this gure, a measure of the market power wielded by each country at the six-digit 4In chapter 4 (see note 38), I con rm that this feature is implied by the de nition of reciprocity that I introduced just above. 15HS industry level (denoted as \u0011BRin the gure) is used to distribute the products into10bins by decile of market power along the horizontal axis, with the lowest decile of market power on the left and the highest on the right; and the tari\u00a4 cuts (expressed as percent deviations from the mean tari\u00a4 cut) that these countries agreed to when they joined the WTO are measured on the vertical axis. Figure 1.9 displays a strong positive relationship between market power and the tari\u00a4 cuts that countries agree to when they become WTO members, consistent with the position that the GATT/WTO is indeed helping to induce large countries to make the tari\u00a4 choices that they would make if they were small countries. Figure 1.9 (Reproduced from Bagwell and Staiger, 2011) The implications of the GATT/WTO reciprocity principle can also be seen in the responses elicited by the recent tari\u00a4 actions of the Trump Administration on imported steel and aluminum. For example, in a March 2 2018 article titled \u0093Trump\u0092 s Tari\u00a4s Prompt Global Threats of Retaliation,\u0094 the New York Times described the European Union (EU) countermeasures in these terms: ... The European Union detailed a three-step plan to penalize $3.5 billion of American trade \u0096the same amount of European steel and aluminum the bloc estimates would be harmed by the planned tari\u00a4s. It proposed taxing American exports including bourbon, bluejeans, orange juice, cranberries, rice and motorcycles. ... A European Union o\u00a2 cial said that the bloc had been preparing for the announcement for months and that everything was in place for a swift, proportionate response. The reciprocal (\u0093proportionate\u0094 ) tari\u00a4 response of the EU is in line with the response envisioned under GATT/WTO rules to a unilateral increase in tari\u00a4s 16such as that initiated by the Trump Administration. As Figure 1.8 suggests, such a response prevents the United States from using these tari\u00a4s to increase the revenue that (on net) it collects from foreign exporters. And facing the trade-o\u00a4s of a small country in the face of this reciprocal response, if the United States still wants to raise its tari\u00a4s, then according to the logic I have described above it is internationally e\u00a2 cient for it to be allowed to do so. Notice too that, contrary to how it might appear, the US tari\u00a4 action and the EU response described by the March 2 New York Times article do not, as far as they go, constitute the outbreak of a trade war. Rather, in limiting the EU\u0092 s response to be in line with the reciprocity principle, this is how the GATT/WTO system works to avoid a trade war. The US Council of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) stated as much with regard to the novel role played by a \u0087 edgling GATT in 1955 when, in the context of US actions restricting trade in dairy products and European responses to those actions, it observed that: The Organization\u0092 s control over countermeasures of this kind enables it to keep such measures within reasonable limits: to allow countermeasures commensurate with the action which occasions them; and to hold in check emotional reactions which might result in punitive measures by countries injured against the country responsible for the injury. The control over countermeasures is a check on the development of trade wars. (US Council of the ICC, 1955) From this perspective, what does look like the beginnings of a trade war was reported in the New York Times on March 3 with the headline \u0093Escalating Trade Fight, Trump Threatens Higher Taxes on European Cars\u0094 : President Trump warned on Saturday that he would apply higher taxes on imported European cars if the European Union carried through on its threat to retaliate against his proposed sti\u00a4 new tari\u00a4s on steel and aluminum. \u0093If the E.U. wants to further increase their already massive tari\u00a4s and barriers on U.S. companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S.,\u0094Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter from Florida, where he was spending part of the weekend. \u0093They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. Big trade imbalance! ...\u0094 In the end, the EU did carry through on its threat to retaliate against the new US steel and aluminum tari\u00a4s with reciprocal tari\u00a4 hikes of its own, and the 17threatened further US tari\u00a4s on imported cars from the EU were never imposed. So in this case, at least, where there was an initial unilateral trade action by the United States and a reciprocal response from its injured trading partner, and there it ended, one could say that a trade war was averted; or, perhaps more accurately, especially when viewed along other trade actions of the Trump Administration that I will return to later, that it was a \u0093one-sided\u0094trade war. What about the shallow approach to integration that is the hallmark of the GATT/WTO? Can this feature of GATT/WTO design be seen as compatible with an institution whose purpose is to internalize the negative international ex- ternalities of the trade policy choices of its member countries? Could a shallow approach to integration ever hope to mitigate these externalities? Or should this approach be seen rather as a failing of the GATT/WTO, as a sign of institutional weakness, an inability to proceed su\u00a2 ciently far in pursuit of globalization? These are important questions, and their answers are complex. But there is one sense in which a clear foundation for GATT\u0092 s shallow approach to integration can be seen in the arguments I have reviewed above: according to those arguments, at the dawn of the GATT only trade policies, not domestic policies , would have been set ine\u00a2 ciently. This is because it is the tari\u00a4 that most directly imposes the international externality that is responsible for the international ine\u00a2 ciency of unilateral policy choices, and it is therefore the tari\u00a4 that bears the imprint of these motives. For this reason, an approach to integration that focuses on liberalizing tari\u00a4s and other border impediments to trade, with rules that prevent countries from introducing protective domestic measures as substitutes for tari\u00a4s once tari\u00a4s and other border measures have been constrained by the agreement, can in principle accomplish everything that a trade agreement needs to accomplish in order to implement internationally e\u00a2 cient policy outcomes. As I will describe in later chapters, this is essentially the approach that the GATT/WTO has taken. From this perspective, the underlying approach of the GATT/WTO can be seen as avoiding the sharpest con\u0087 icts between globalization and national sovereignty, and indeed as making domestic policy choices more e\u00a4ective, not less. Finally, above I described the trade actions of the Trump Administration with regard to imports of steel and aluminum, and I noted that these actions, in combi- nation with the reciprocal tari\u00a4 response from the EU, did not constitute a trade war but were instead in line with the kinds of reciprocal tari\u00a4 adjustments envi- sioned under the GATT/WTO design. To be clear, I was using this episode only to illustrate a speci c point, not to make a blanket statement about the WTO- consistency of the Trump Administration\u0092 s world view of the ideal global trading 18system. In fact, while US dissatisfaction with the GATT/WTO has been building for some time and certainly did not start with the Trump Administration, the Trump administration took US distaste for the WTO to a new level. For this reason, it is instructive at this point to compare the rules-based trading system of the GATT/WTO as I have described that system above against the alternative global trade order envisioned by the Trump Administration. What was the Trump Administration\u0092 s vision for the global trade order? Wilbur Ross, US Secretary of Commerce put it this way: \u0093An ideal global trading system would facilitate adoption of the lowest possible level of tari\u00a4s. ... [C]ountries with the lowest tari\u00a4s would apply reciprocal tari\u00a4s to those with the highest and then automatically lower that reciprocal tari\u00a4 as the other country lowers theirs. This leveling technique could be applied product by product or across the board on an aggregated basis. Such a modi cation would motivate high-tari\u00a4 countries to reduce their tari\u00a4s on imports.\u0094(Wall Street Journal, May 25 2017) And the vision articulated by Commerce Secretary Ross was echoed in vari- ous Trump tweets, such as the one below. Evidently, according to this vision, . the purpose of trade agreements would be to achieve reciprocal free trade or, barring that, then at least a \u0093level playing eld\u0094across countries. And as for the means of achieving this purpose, the ideal global trading system according to the Trump Ad- ministration would dispense with MFN and seek reciprocity in tari\u00a4 levels , not in tari\u00a4 changes as in the role of reciprocity in the GATT/WTO which I have illustrated in the gures above. In short, the Trump Administration\u0092 s vision for the global trade order amounts to a \u0093Repeal and Replace\u0094 strategy, as it poses an existential chal- lenge to the pillars of the GATT/WTO architecture. It would abandon MFN. It would emphasize a form of reciprocity that is not found in the GATT/WTO. And in seeking global free trade as the ultimate goal, it would strike at the heart of what the GATT/WTO means when it says it is a \u0093member driven\u0094organiza- tion. At a minimum, this vision, expressed by a US Administration in the early decades of the twenty- rst century, illustrates the depth of the challenges that now confront the rules-based world trading system of the twentieth century. 19The role of rules in a rules-based global trading system I have argued above that the key design features of the GATT/WTO are consistent with an institution whose purpose is to internalize the negative international externalities of the trade policy choices of its member countries. But what di\u00a4erence do these rules make anyway? While it seems clear enough that in the presence of these externalities countries can gain from negotiations over their trade policy choices, what would be lost if countries engaged in \u0093power-based\u0094 tari\u00a4 bargaining to address these issues without reference to any previously agreed-upon rules? Broadly speaking, the rules-based system of the GATT/WTO has two main potential advantages over a power-based approach to tari\u00a4 bargaining. First, the rules of the GATT/WTO can simplify the tari\u00a4 bargaining problem and make it manageable, and this can help countries negotiate to e\u00a2 cient policies. And second, these rules can mitigate the power of the most powerful countries, and in so doing can encourage the participation of weaker countries in the global trading system who might otherwise be vulnerable to exploitation by the stronger countries. Regarding its simplifying role, I have noted that MFN simpli es the structure of the international policy externality that would otherwise arise in a multi-country world, ensuring that this externality continues to take the simple form that it would take in a two-country world. As for reciprocity, it can be seen to shape GATT/WTO tari\u00a4 negotiations in two ways: it is a norm of negotiation when a tari\u00a4 is to be reduced and bound at a lower level; and it is a rule that de nes the threat point for renegotiation when a previously bound tari\u00a4 is to be raised. If countries abide rigidly by these norms and rules, reciprocity in combination with MFN a\u00a4ords a dramatic simpli cation of the tari\u00a4 bargaining problem. This is because as a norm of negotiation, reciprocity xes the terms of exchange of market access: if it has been previously agreed that the negotiations will abide by reciprocity, then the terms of the deal are xed , with countries exchanging market access concessions and implied trade volumes one for one . And by de ning the threat point for renegotiation, reciprocity indirectly determines the extent of mar- ket access that is exchanged, through the implied requirement that this exchange is \u0093voluntary\u0094 ; that is, the size of the deal is determined by the negotiating party that wants the smallest deal at these terms, because if that party were pushed in the bargain to accept a bigger deal/lower tari\u00a4s than it wanted, it could always renegotiate subsequently to raise tari\u00a4s and \u0096with reciprocity de ning its threat point \u0096in the end get the size of the deal it wanted anyway while preserving the reciprocal terms. And with the terms of the deal xed and its size determined, there is then nothing left for countries to bargain over! 20Regarding the role of GATT/WTO rules in mitigating the power of the most powerful countries, this role is obviously ful lled if, as I have described above, countries rigidly abide by MFN and reciprocity in their tari\u00a4 bargaining, since if under these rules and norms there is nothing left to bargain over, then there is clearly no room for the exercise of power in tari\u00a4 negotiations. But even absent rigid adherence to these rules and norms, the ability of countries to exert their power in GATT/WTO tari\u00a4 bargains is likely to be constrained. For example, even if not joined by reciprocity, the MFN requirement alone still dilutes the ability of a powerful country to enjoy the bene ts of its power. This is because in exerting its power to secure for its exporters more-than-reciprocal tari\u00a4concessions from its bargaining partner, the non-discriminatory nature of those tari\u00a4 cuts will ensure that other exporting countries siphon o\u00a4 part of the gain. The upshot is that the rules of the GATT/WTO tend to blunt the exercise of bargaining power. Why, then, would powerful countries accept these rules? One reason is that the e\u00a2 ciency gains from simplifying the bargaining may be su\u00a2 ciently great that powerful countries can gain directly from the rules even as their ability to exert bargaining power is constrained. But there is also a further reason that powerful countries may see it in their interest to support a rules-based multilateral trading system: by making a commitment to adhere to these rules, powerful countries can help secure the participation of weaker countries who might otherwise fear exploitation, and allcountries can gain as a result. The declining hegemon This last observation suggests that the most powerful countries may bene t from a rules-based multilateral trading system precisely because they areso powerful. This may help explain why the United States was, along with the United Kingdom, the champion of the rules-based system at its creation in 1947 with the birth of GATT. But it is then also not hard to imagine that, if the position of the most powerful countries in the world trading system were to erode su\u00a2 ciently, weaker countries might well choose to participate in trade bargaining even under a power-based system. And in that case, the powerful countries might then prefer to escape from the rules and pursue power-based trade bargaining with the weaker countries. This raises the possibility that, with the rise of the large emerging and devel- oping economies and the decline in hegemonic status that the United States has experienced in recent decades, its support for the rules-based system could wane: being far less dominant in the global economy than it was in 1947, the United States no longer needs international rules to help it commit not to exploit other 21countries in trade bargaining in order to convince those countries to engage in the global economy. And if the declining hegemonic position of the United States is indeed a primary cause of the challenges now faced by the rules-based multilateral trading system, to repair that system the world may have to wait for the rise of another hegemon. Along these lines and in the broader context of security and trade, historian/commentator Robert Kagan sees the rules-based international order as \u0093a historical anomaly\u0094 made possible by U.S. leadership, which is now collapsing, \u0093returning the world to its natural state \u0096a dark jungle of competing interests, clashing nationalism, tribalism and self-interest.\u0094(Kagan, 2018). If this is the correct diagnosis, it is full of irony. According to this diagnosis, the design of the rules-based multilateral trading system has proven e\u00a4ective in solving an important and still-relevant problem, yet the system will inevitably collapse. And while China is seen by many as a source of some of the greatest challenges for the rules-based trading system of the twenty- rst century, if this diagnosis is correct it may be that the rise of China is the world\u0092 s best hope for the return of a viable rules-based multilateral trading system. In any case, to the extent that this diagnosis does capture the main cause of the rules-based trading system\u0092 s ills, there is great value in attempting to support, preserve and improve the existing global trade order until such time as it can again thrive on its own. As noted above, the fundamental design of the rules-based multilateral trading system has proven e\u00a4ective in solving an important and, by this diagnosis, still-relevant problem, and it should not be allowed to wither away. By this diagnosis the shallow-integration approach of the GATT/WTO is well- designed to solve the fundamental trade agreement problem: as such, a stark trade-o\u00a4 between sovereignty and globalization may be avoidable, but only if the WTO is supported and its approach strengthened. Could China be the next hegemon that the WTO is looking for? Currently to many this may seem unlikely, but as its dominance grows, China may see it in its interest to more fully commit to these rules; and until that time, according to this diagnosis the WTO deserves broad support as the legitimate constitution of the global trade order. The implications of o\u00a4shoring The rise of o\u00a4shoring could provide an alter- native diagnosis for the current challenges faced by the rules-based trading system to that implied by a declining hegemon, and one that is in some sense more dire. This is because in altering the nature of trade, o\u00a4shoring may also have changed the nature of international price determination and the international policy exter- nalities that are the source of the problem that the rules of the GATT/WTO are 22well-designed to solve. And if this is the case, then in a world economy dominated by o\u00a4shoring and global value chains, new and di\u00a4erent rules may be needed to help countries address the novel international policy externalities that arise. This can be seen most clearly with regard to the potential implications of o\u00a4- shoring for the e\u00a2 cacy of shallow integration. According to the arguments I have reviewed above, at the dawn of the GATT only trade policies, not domestic poli- cies, would have been set ine\u00a2 ciently, because it is the tari\u00a4 that most directly imposes the international externality that is responsible for the international inef- ciency of unilateral policy choices. This statement holds for the nature of trade that dominated most of the twentieth century, that is, the international exchange of nished or largely nished goods and raw materials, where international prices are determined by the kinds of supply-equals-demand market clearing conditions that are featured in the gures described above. But when trade is dominated by specialized components, such as is the case with the production and assembly of the Boeing Dreamliner illustrated in Figure 1.2, exchanged between sellers and buyers that have limited outside market options at the time that the exchanges occur, the prices at which these trades occur may be determined by bargaining and novel impacts of trade and domestic policies on international prices can then arise. And as a result, even when they are not yet constrained by a trade agree- ment, all policies, both trade anddomestic, may be set ine\u00a2 ciently. When this is the case, the foundation for the GATT/WTO shallow approach to integration that I described above no longer holds, and a deeper approach to integration may be needed to address the policy ine\u00a2 ciencies of the global economy. It is therefore possible that the rise of o\u00a4shoring has changed the nature of international policy externalities, and in doing so has made the shallow-integration approach of the GATT/WTO no longer well-designed to solve the fundamental trade agreement problem. If this is so, then deeper forms of integration will be required to achieve internationally e\u00a2 cient policies, and a stark trade-o\u00a4 between sovereignty and globalization may now be unavoidable (and as I will discuss, something similar may be behind the recent push toward regulatory harmonization as an end in itself). But it is also possible that the rise of o\u00a4shoring has not fundamentally changed the nature of international policy externalities, or has changed the nature of the policy externalities only temporarily, as o\u00a4shoring itself may be a transitory phenomenon. Either way, it is di\u00a2 cult to see how \u0093Repeal and Replace\u0094could be the right strategy for arriving at an e\u00a4ective world trading system for the twenty- rst century, as that strategy risks throwing the baby out with the bath water and, by undercutting the WTO, undermining the best hope 23for a balance between globalization and national sovereignty. Instead, building on the GATT/WTO foundation to address these twenty- rst century problems where they exist seems like a sensible approach, even if the world trading system of the twentieth century is ultimately in need of a more fundamental overhaul. The stakes of getting it right There would also be another implication of the demise of the WTO: the loss of an international institution that has built- in procedures for rethinking levels of market access commitments in an orderly, rules-based fashion. Through its reciprocity principle, GATT/WTO market access commitments are structured as \u0093liability rules\u0094 that permit legal buy outs of previously agreed market access commitments whenever a country believes that its previous commitments to levels of market access are no longer serving its interests. As I will argue in later chapters, these and other built-in \u0087 exibilities may help the logic of GATT\u0092 s design transcend many of the current challenges faced by the WTO, including the challenges posed byChina\u0092 s economic model, the rise of large emerging and developing economies in the world trading system more generally, digital trade, and accommodating e\u00a4orts to address climate change. In short, in light of what has come before and what is at stake, the best advice for creating a world trading system for the twenty- rst century may not be \u0093Move fast and break things,\u0094but rather Keep Calm and Carry On. Part I The World Trading System of the Twentieth Century In the next ve chapters, I describe the economic logic of the broad design features of GATT, and I review a body of research that seeks to evaluate and understand the success of GATT in serving as the constitution of the world trading system of the twentieth century. In light of the changes in the economic environment that globalization has brought about over the past three decades, understanding the logic of GATT\u0092 s design, and in what environments that logic makes economic sense, is a precursor to evaluating whether changes are warranted for the consti- tution of the world trading system of the twenty- rst century and, if changes are warranted, what changes are needed. 24I begin in chapter 2 with an overview of the GATT/WTO, and I introduce the basic features of a modeling framework that has been used to interpret its design. In chapters 3, 4 and 5 I discuss research that evaluates GATT\u0092 s design as it relates speci cally to tari\u00a4 bargaining, the foundational activity of the GATT/WTO. I conclude Part I with chapter 6, where I shift focus and describe research that emphasizes the incompleteness of the GATT/WTO contract and provides inter- pretations of some of its more puzzling design features from that perspective. 2. The GATT/WTO In this chapter I provide a broad overview of the GATT as well as its successor the WTO, and of the basic modeling framework that will provide my foundation for an economic interpretation of GATT\u0092 s design features, its successes, and ultimately its shortcomings. I begin by describing GATT\u0092 s design and a brief history of how it came to be, and I then present the modeling framework. 2.1. The design of the GATT/WTO5 Origins The direct historical antecedents of what would eventually serve as the de facto constitution of the world trading system of the twentieth century arose at a time of crisis. Trade barriers had become increasingly restrictive in the decade following World War I, and reached a climax when the United States enacted the Smoot-Hawley Tari\u00a4 Act of 1930, increasing average U.S. tari\u00a4s from 38to52%. U.S. trading partners responded, and soon tari\u00a4 rates among all the major powers were generally on the order of 50%. As Hudec (1990, p. 5) explains, \u0093the postwar design for international trade policy was animated by a single-minded concern to avoid repeating the disastrous errors of the 1920\u0092 s and 1930\u0092 s.\u0094 In 1934, the U.S. Congress passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act (RTAA). Under the RTAA, the United States for the rst time engaged in bi- lateral reciprocal tari\u00a4 bargaining with a sequence of trading partners, and it combined this bilateral bargaining approach with unconditional MFN, according to which exports from each country with whom the United States had an agree- ment under the RTAA would automatically receive the lowest (\u0093most favored nation\u0094 ) tari\u00a4 rate that the United States o\u00a4ered to any exporting country. It is 5The material in this section builds from chapter 3 of Bagwell and Staiger (2002) and section 4 of Bagwell and Staiger (2010a). 25widely acknowledged that much of the GATT architecture was inspired by prior U.S. experience with the RTAA. What is less-well appreciated is the way in which the RTAA was itself in- \u0087 uenced by the successes and failures of the many international attempts that came before it to address the problem of high and rising trade barriers. During the decade following World War I, the United States took part in a number of multilateral bargaining e\u00a4orts to address this issue, each largely unsuccessful. In describing the evolution away from multilateral bargaining and toward the bilat- eral bargaining approach that would eventually be embodied in the RTAA, Tasca (1938, p. 7) attributes the lack of success of these earlier multilateral attempts to the complexity of multi-country bargaining: The adoption of a policy of bilateral actions does not preclude the use of multilateral conventions to liquidate trade barriers. During the post-war period various attempts to proceed upon this basis have met with little success. It is the method itself which possesses weaknesses in certain re- spects. ... The complexities involved in such a program of concerted action arise in part out of the fundamental variations in national tari\u00a4 systems. This means that practically only horizontal reductions in tari\u00a4s can be con- sidered feasible. But the di\u00a4erences in the economies concerned and their varying positions in the world economy demand reductions in trade barri- ers according to the circumstances in each case. Moreover, the di\u00a4usion of responsibility grows with the number of prospective contractants. Nations became less concerned with the failure of a projected plurilateral pact and more with the possibility of yielding more in the way of concessions than other nations. As Tasca observes, these repeated failures of multilateral bargaining led to a con- scious decision on the part of the United States to experiment with bilateral bargaining under the RTAA. The RTAA was remarkable not only because it adopted a bilateral bargaining approach to the problem, but because it marked the rst time that the United States combined bilateral tari\u00a4 bargaining with unconditional MFN.6Yet while the approach embodied in the RTAA was novel from the U.S. perspective, from the perspective of Europeans it was not. As Tasca (1938, p. 135) observes, 6The United States had, since 1922, adopted an unconditional MFN approach, but it main- tained an \u0093autonomous\u0094(i.e., 1938, pp. 116-121). 26for decades before, the approach of combining bilateral tari\u00a4 bargaining with MFN treatment \u0093formed the essential basis of the commercial policies of numerous European countries.\u0094 In fact, it appears that the design and implementation of the RTAA built on lessons learned from the European experience in at least two important ways. First, the European experience with bilateral tari\u00a4 bargaining established the practical necessity of granting unconditional MFN. As Wallace (1933, p. 629) writes: ...After the World War, France experimented with the idea of abandoning the most-favored-nation clause...By 1927 France was again driven back to the granting of most-favored-nation treatment, either de jure or de facto. The reason is not far to seek. When a country, by exclusive tari\u00a4 bargains, institutes discriminations against third countries, then the greater these dis- criminations the greater will be the pressure against that country for their removal. In each successive negotiation it nds that the rmest demand of the other country is for equality of treatment, present and future, guarded by a most-favored-nation clause or its equivalent. In e\u00a4ect, the European experience with bilateral tari\u00a4 bargaining taught the im- portant lesson that a country\u0092 s current bargaining partners would require assur- ance that any future bilateral deals that it struck with other countries would not substantially erode the value of the concessions being granted, and that the most practical way to provide assurance against such \u0093concession erosion\u0094was with a promise of unconditional MFN. The promise of unconditional MFN was included in the RTAA in part to address the concession erosion issue.7 Second, the European experience provided an object lesson in the power of the perverse incentive to raise tari\u00a4s and adopt so-called \u0093bargaining tari\u00a4s\u0094to better position oneself for future negotiations. According to Wallace (1938, p. 630), ...[t]his padding of tari\u00a4 rates in anticipation of negotiations is a chief reason why half a century of bargaining has meant on the whole higher and higher tari\u00a4 rates in Europe instead of lower and lower rates. This also informed the design of the RTAA. As Tasca (1938, p. 179) observes, 7Other arguments articulated at the time for adopting a policy of unconditional MFN in- cluded the perceived \u0093multilateralization\u0094bene ts that this inclusion was expected to engender, and a reduction in the risk of war (see, for example, Culbert, 1987 and Rhodes, 1993). 27The United States Tari\u00a4 Commission in submitting recommendations on tari\u00a4 bargaining declared, \u0091 The Congress should formulate restrictions de- signed to prevent the inclusion in reciprocity agreements of illusory con- cessions; that is, the removal of trade barriers or the reduction of tari\u00a4 rates when such barriers and rates had been raised in anticipation of tar- i\u00a4 bargaining, the amount of the concessions being smaller than or not greater than the previous increases in barriers and rates. Speci cally, it is suggested that the Congress prescribe that all concessions included in the reciprocity agreements, on both sides, be made from the rates and relating to the barriers in e\u00a4ect at a date which shall be xed by the Congress\u0092 ... The lessons learned from the European experience with bilateral tari\u00a4 bar- gaining may therefore have contributed to the success of bilateral tari\u00a4 bargaining under the RTAA by helping the United States avoid the twin problems associated with concession erosion and bargaining tari\u00a4s that plagued the European e\u00a4orts before it. But as it happened, the adoption of unconditional MFN would itself introduce a di\u00a4erent potential issue for the RTAA, one that was related to the earlier problem of bargaining tari\u00a4s that the Europeans had experienced but took a slightly di\u00a4erent form: while in the European experience this issue had taken the form of the unilateral positioning of pre-negotiation tari\u00a4s, under the RTAA the analogous issue became how to design bilateral agreements with early negoti- ating partners to best preserve bargaining power for later agreements with other negotiating partners. This task was made di\u00a2 cult by the unconditional MFN requirement, which automatically granted \u0093for free\u0094to other potential bargaining partners any tari\u00a4 concessions granted to early negotiating partners. The preservation of bargaining power for later negotiations became a major preoccupation of the United States under the RTAA. Describing the tactics used by the United States in this regard, Tasca (1938, pp. 146-147) notes: There are, then, ve methods being utilized by the United States to assure the compatibility of the unconditional most-favored-nation clause with a conventional tari\u00a4 bargaining program. By far the most basic is the chief supplier formula. This is reenforced by the reclassi cation of commodities in the tari\u00a4 schedules of the Act of 1930. The use of partial reductions in successive agreements, the simultaneous negotiations with groups of coun- tries and the withdrawal clause are subsidiary to the rst two. They play the part of supporting beams in those instances in which the chief supplier is not entirely applicable to existing conditions. 28In e\u00a4ect, by granting tari\u00a4 concessions to a negotiating partner only on those products for which the partner was the principal (\u0093chief\u0094 ) supplier, possibly com- bined with product reclassi cation for tari\u00a4 purposes to heighten the dominance of the partner in these products, it was thought that much of the free-rider po- tential created by unconditional MFN could be eliminated. And where free-riding remained a substantial possibility, three additional tactics were available: splitting the concession into a sequence of partial tari\u00a4 reductions negotiated with di\u00a4er- ent countries in successive agreements; attempting to engage groups of countries in simultaneous negotiations; and threatening to withdraw or modify the earlier agreement if free-riding continued. Beckett (1941) reviews the U.S. experience under the RTAA, and emphasizes the di\u00a2 culties involved in preserving bargaining power in the presence of uncon- ditional MFN, even when the chief supplier rule is applied. As she describes, split concessions often became the preferred method to prevent undue loss of bargaining power in an early negotiation: It is important to notice that the use of the chief supplier rule involves certain special di\u00a2 culties. A problem arises, for instance, when, during the process of negotiation with small countries, it is impossible to isolate any commodities in which the other country is our chief supplier...A further dif- culty appears when two or more countries supply almost exactly the same quantity of a given commodity or when two countries are the chief suppliers of the commodity in alternative years. If a substantial reduction in duty is granted in the trade agreement with one country, bargaining power with the other country is lost. To avoid such embarrassment, simultaneous nego- tiations of two agreements can be attempted. More often a split concession is granted: that is, a small reduction in duty is made in the agreement with the rst country and an additional reduction in the agreement with the second country. By this procedure bargaining power with the second country is preserved... (Beckett, 1941, p. 23). Tasca (1938, p. 146) also emphasizes the importance in this regard of the various withdrawal clauses that were included in the RTAA: If the major bene ts of a duty concession fall to a third country and \u0091 in consequence thereof an unduly large increase in importation\u0092takes place, the contractants may withdraw the concession or impose a quantitative restriction upon imports of that item. Concessions are granted by the 29United States only after careful study in order to gauge the e\u00a4ects upon the whole economy; if these calculations should fail, then there exists a remedy in resort to this clause. But what is more signi cant, this withdrawal clause forestalls any third country from reaping any considerable bene t from a concession which might in any manner lessen its incentive to promulgate a pact with the United States... The practice of granting split concessions became the most frequently observed manifestation of bargaining tari\u00a4s under the RTAA, while the threat to withdraw or modify a concession was typically kept in the background but seen as providing an important means of maintaining bargaining leverage for later negotiations. In short, tari\u00a4 bargaining under the RTAA exhibited a number of central fea- tures. The approach was decidedly bilateral, chosen only after the United States had considered, attempted, and ultimately rejected multilateral tari\u00a4 bargain- ing. Prior European experience with concession erosion and bargaining tari\u00a4s in\u0087 uenced the design and implementation of the RTAA along important dimen- sions. And unconditional MFN, the chief supplier rule, split concessions and withdrawal/modi cation clauses were understood to be central to the operation of reciprocal tari\u00a4 bargaining under the RTAA. Between 1934 and 1947, the United States successfully concluded separate bi- lateral agreements with 29 countries. Encouraged by its success in the bilateral arena with the RTAA, the United States sought to build upon the key compo- nents and establish a multilateral institution. In 1946, negotiations began for the creation of an International Trade Organization (ITO). As with the RTAA, under the ITO it was expected that negotiations between governments would result in reciprocal and mutually advantageous reductions in tari\u00a4s, and the principle of non-discrimination would then ensure that the reduced tari\u00a4s would be extended to all member countries. In 1947, GATT was negotiated and was intended to serve as an interim agreement, but the ITO was never rati ed by the U.S. Congress. Stated Purpose What is the stated purpose of GATT? According to its Pream- ble, the objectives of the contracting parties include \u0093raising standards of living, ensuring full employment and a large and steadily growing volume of real income and e\u00a4ective demand, developing the full use of the resources of the world and expanding the production and exchange of goods.\u0094 30As for the means to achieve this purpose, the Preamble of GATT states the contracting parties\u0092belief that \u0093reciprocal and mutually advantageous arrangements directed to the sub- stantial reduction in tari\u00a4s and other barriers to trade and to the elimination of discriminatory treatment in international commerce\u0094 would contribute toward these goals. The objectives stated in the Preamble to the WTO are broadened to include the exchange of not only goods but also of services, and to acknowledge the additional objectives of sustainable development, the protection and preservation of the environment, and the greater inclusion of developing countries to share in the gains from the growth of trade. But the means to achieve this purpose as stated in the WTO Preamble are identical to those in the GATT Preamble (with the phrase \u0093international trade relations\u0094in the WTO Preamble replacing \u0093international commerce\u0094from the GATT Preamble). Perhaps surprisingly to economists, free trade is not a stated objective of GATT or of the WTO. This re\u0087 ects the fact that, as a \u0093member-driven\u0094organi- zation that serves as a trade policy negotiating forum for member governments with diverse interests, priorities and needs, the GATT/WTO is designed with the aim of securing mutually bene cial agreements among these governments, and free trade is not necessarily something to which all member governments will aspire. In total, there were eight rounds of GATT negotiations that together spanned almost 50years. The primary focus of the earlier rounds was the reduction of import tari\u00a4s on goods. In the nal GATT round, known as the Uruguay Round, governments took on several new issue areas (e.g., investment, services and intel- lectual property) and formed the WTO. The WTO has sponsored a ninth round, the Doha Round, launched in 2001 and as yet uncompleted. The WTO embraces the rules and agreements made in GATT negotiations, but it is also a full-\u0087 edged international organization, with an explicit organizational charter and a uni ed dispute-settlement system. In e\u00a4ect, with the creation of the WTO, participating governments ful lled their original quest with the ITO for an o\u00a2 cial international organization that would set and administer the rules of the world trading system. Architecture GATT/WTO member governments are obliged to abide by a set of rules. In GATT, these rules were laid out in a series of 39articles. The WTO has incorporated these GATT articles and extended the principles embodied in them to a number of new issue areas. I now provide an overview of the GATT/WTO legal structure by focussing on the principles embodied in these articles. 31It is helpful to distinguish between three broad elements: substantive oblig- ations, exceptions to those obligations, and dispute settlement procedures. The substantive obligations of a GATT/WTO member relate to tari\u00a4 commitments, MFN treatment and a general \u0093code of conduct\u0094in the international-trade arena. Broadly speaking, these provisions oblige the member-governments to concen- trate national protective measures into the form of tari\u00a4s, to apply them on a non-discriminatory basis to other members, and to honor any tari\u00a4 \u0093bindings\u0094 made in a GATT/WTO negotiation, where the tari\u00a4 binding refers to a legal maximum level above which a country agrees not to raise its tari\u00a4. As mentioned, the GATT/WTO also provides for certain exceptions to these obligations. One class of exceptions is for \u0093original\u0094 actions, such as when a member seeks to suspend an obligation temporarily, or to permanently withdraw a previous concession through renegotiation. The rationale for including excep- tions of this nature is that a government is more likely to make a substantial tari\u00a4 commitment if it knows that the legal system has \u0093safeguards\u0094 allowing its concessions to be modi ed or withdrawn under appropriate conditions. Of course, a tari\u00a4 commitment would lose its meaning if exceptions for original ac- tions were not subject to some disciplining structure. In part for this reason, and in part to maintain a balance between the rights and obligations of the members, GATT/WTO rules permit as well a second class of exceptions for \u0093retaliatory\u0094 actions. Speci cally, if a government modi es or withdraws a previous concession, then GATT/WTO rules recognize that a cost may be borne by a trading partner. This partner may then seek \u0093compensation\u0094 from the government for the harm done (e.g., a tari\u00a4 reduction from the government on some other good), and if this fails the partner is allowed to achieve \u0093self-help\u0094 compensation through re- taliation. The meaning of retaliation is that the trading partner can reciprocate by withdrawing a concession of a \u0093substantially equivalent\u0094nature. The third element mentioned above is the GATT/WTO dispute settlement procedures. Here a central issue is the determination whether the actions by one country serve to \u0093nullify or impair\u0094 the bene ts expected under the agreement by another country. Nulli cation or impairment includes actions taken by one country \u0093which harmed the trade of another, and which \u0091 could not reasonably have been anticipated\u0092by the other at the time it negotiated for a concession\u0094 (Jackson, 1997, p. 115). In the typical \u0093violation complaint,\u0094a country is alleged to have failed to comply with one or more of its GATT/WTO obligations, leading to a prima facie case of nulli cation or impairment. An important distinction arises between the procedures associated with safe- 32guard exceptions and those that are associated with nulli cation or impairment. The safeguard procedures provide explicitly for the lawful suspension of obliga- tions or withdrawal of negotiated concessions, and these procedures specify as well the permissible retaliatory responses of trading partners. By contrast, the dispute settlement procedures govern retaliation against a country that takes a harmful action which its trading partners could not have anticipated under GATT/WTO rules. In the typical complaint, at issue is whether the o\u00a4ending country has violated GATT/WTO rules, and retaliation here may then be more directly con- cerned with the enforcement of rules. The procedure for settling disputes consists of three stages: rst, there is a consultation phase among the involved parties; second, a GATT/WTO panel (and, after appeal, the Appellate Body) conducts an investigation and issues a ruling and recommendation; and as a last resort, authorization of retaliation occurs. Resolution is often achieved in the rst stage, or it may follow the panel ruling. If the panel nds that nulli cation or impairment has occurred, then it recommends that the o\u00a4ending country correct any illegal measures. The o\u00a4ending country may be unwilling to do so, however. In this case, it may seek a negotiated resolution by o\u00a4ering the harmed country compensation via MFN tari\u00a4 reductions on some other goods. If compensation is not o\u00a4ered, or if it is o\u00a4ered but rejected, then the harmed country may follow through with the last-resort response: an authorized and discriminatory suspension of tari\u00a4 concessions. In practice, the number of authorized retaliations has been small, though this number has grown in the WTO era. As Rhodes (1993, p. 109) observes, however, the threat of authorized retaliation is often the catalyst for a resolution of the dispute in the earlier stages. It is notable that, while authorized retaliation in the context of dispute reso- lution is allowed to be discriminatory, it is nevertheless generally limited to the suspension of concessions of a substantially equivalent nature. One might have thought that the GATT/WTO would authorize and coordinate maximal retali- ation against a member government found to be in violation of the rules by the GATT/WTO\u0092 s own dispute settlement body. But in fact, as the early report of the United States International Chamber of Commerce from which I quoted in chapter 1 observed, the GATT dispute settlement procedures keep a lidon per- missible retaliation levels, and this is how the GATT/WTO dispute settlement system works to avoid a trade war. This point was re\u0087 ected in a statement made by one of the drafters of the original GATT Articles governing retaliation in the context of dispute settlement, as found in Petersmann (1997, pp. 82-83): The drafting history of Article XXIII:2 con rms that it was designed to 33limit the customary law right of unilateral reprisals, whose exercise had contributed so much to the \u0091 law of the jungle\u0092 in international economic a\u00a4airs during the 1930\u0092 s, and to introduce, as stated by one of the drafters, \u0091 a new principle in international economic relations. We have asked the nations of the world to confer upon an international organization the right to limit their power to retaliate. We have sought to tame retaliation, to discipline it, to keep it within bounds. By subjecting it to the restraints of international control, we have endeavored to check its spread and growth, to convert it from a weapon of economic warfare to an instrument of inter- national order.\u0092 Indeed, Schwartz and Sykes (2002) argue that the major innovation in the dispute settlement procedures of the WTO relative to GATT was the addition of a mech- anism for arbitrating the magnitude of authorized retaliation so that an e\u00a4ective lid on retaliation could be maintained. Finally, it is often observed that, along with MFN, reciprocity is a pillar of the GATT/WTO architecture. In the GATT/WTO, the principle of reciprocity refers to the ideal of mutual changes in trade policy which bring about changes in the volume of each country\u0092 s imports that are of equal value to changes in the volume of its exports. The preceding discussion contains two instances in which the notion of reciprocity arises. First, as I have observed, when governments negotiate in GATT/WTO rounds, they do so with the stated goal of obtaining mutually advantageous arrangements through reciprocal reductions in tari\u00a4 bindings: in this context, it is often observed that governments approach negotiations seeking a \u0093balance of concessions,\u0094whereby the market access value of the tari\u00a4cut o\u00a4ered by one government is balanced against an \u0093equivalent\u0094concession from its trading partner. This rst instance of reciprocity therefore refers to changes in tari\u00a4s in a liberalizing direction. Second, when a government seeks to renegotiate its tari\u00a4 commitments and modi es or withdraws a previous concession as an original action, and more generally whenever a government takes an action which nulli es or impairs the bene ts expected under the agreement by another government, GATT/WTO rules permit substantially a\u00a4ected trading partners to retaliate in a reciprocal manner, by withdrawing \u0093substantially equivalent concessions.\u0094This second instance of reciprocity refers to changes in tari\u00a4s in an upward direction. The balance achieved through reciprocity in tari\u00a4 negotiations and the role of retaliation in preserving this balance is re\u0087 ected in the remark by a drafter of the GATT Articles governing retaliation as quoted in Jackson (1969, pp. 170-71): 34\u0093What we have really provided, in the last analysis, is not that retaliation shall be invited or sanctions invoked, but that a balance of interests once established, shall be maintained.\u0094 And the unique role of retaliation in the GATT legal system as a means of pre- serving reciprocity is pointed out by Dam (1970, pp. 80-81): The best guarantee that a commitment of any kind will be kept (particularly in an international setting where courts are of limited importance and, even more important, marshals and jails are nonexistent) is that the parties continue to view adherence to their agreement as in their mutual interest. ... Thus, the GATT system, unlike most legal systems,..., is not designed to exclude self-help in the form of retaliation. Rather, retaliation, subjected to established procedures and kept within prescribed bounds, is made the heart of the GATT system. 2.2. The purpose of trade agreements8 I now present the outlines of a basic modeling framework that will provide my foundation for an economic interpretation of GATT\u0092 s design features, its successes, and ultimately its shortcomings. In this section I develop the model to answer one simple but fundamental question: What problems would governments want a trade agreement to help them solve? The answer to this question clari es the purpose of a trade agreement, and can help guide its design to serve that purpose. To provide an answer, I abstract from possible domestic commitment problems that a government might face and which could lead to domestic ine\u00a2 ciencies in its unilaterally chosen policies, and which it might seek to solve with help from a trade agreement as an external commitment device.9I focus instead on characterizing the possible international ine\u00a2 ciencies that might arise under unilaterally chosen policies and that a trade agreement could address. A useful starting point for this purpose is the standard 2-country 2-good general equilibrium model of trade familiar from any undergraduate international trade course. The general equilibrium trade model The standard general equilibrium model of trade has two countries, home (no *) and foreign (*), who trade two 8The material in this section builds from Chapter 2 of Bagwell and Staiger (2002). 9On the possibility that trade agreements might help solve domestic commitment problems, see the literature reviewed in Bagwell and Staiger (2002, pp 32-34). 35goods which are normal goods in consumption and produced in perfectly compet- itive markets under conditions of increasing opportunity costs. I denote by xthe natural import good of the home country, and by ythe natural import good of the foreign country, and de ne p\u0011px=pyandp\u0003\u0011p\u0003 x=p\u0003 yto be respectively the local relative price in the home and foreign market. With the home-country import tari\u00a4 and \u0003the foreign-country import tari\u00a4 each expressed in ad val- orem terms and assumed to be set at non-prohibitive levels, it then follows that p= (1 \u0093world\u0094(i.e., untaxed) relative price. The foreign terms of trade is then given bypwwhile the home terms of trade is given by ( 1=pw). I am assuming for now that governments possess tari\u00a4s as their only tax/subsidy instrument. This en- sures that both producers and consumers face the same local relative price in the market within which they reside. In later chapters I will introduce into the model a richer array of government policies which include the possibility of regulatory standards as well as production and/or consumption taxes/subsidies, and in the presence of the additional tax/subsidy policies consumers and producers residing in the same market may face di\u00a4erent local prices. Production possibilities in each country are de ned by a production possibili- ties frontier, which with Qdenoting production I represent by the decreasing and concave function Qy(Qx)in the home country and Q\u0003 y(Q\u0003 x)in the foreign country de ned over the feasible values of production of xin each country. Production in a country occurs at the point on the production possibilities frontier where the marginal rate of transformation between xandyis equal to the local relative price, allowing home and foreign production functions to be represented as Qi=Qi(p) andQ\u0003 i=Q\u0003 i(p\u0003)fori=fx;yg. Consumption depends on both the local relative price \u0096 which de nes the trade-o\u00a4 faced by consumers and, in determining the point on the production possibilities frontier at which the economy operates, also implies the level and distribution of factor income in the economy measured at lo- cal prices \u0096and on tari\u00a4revenue, which is distributed lump-sum back to consumers in the country where it is collected. I denote by Rthe tari\u00a4 revenue collected in the home country, and by R\u0003the tari\u00a4 revenue collected in the foreign country, each measured in units of the country\u0092 s export good at local prices. National con- sumption in the home and foreign country can then be written as Di=Di(p;R) andD\u0003 i=D\u0003 i(p\u0003;R\u0003)fori=fx;yg, where tari\u00a4 revenue is de ned implicitly by R= [Dx(p;R)\u0000Qx(p)][p\u0000pw]orR=R(p;pw)for the home country and by R\u0003= [D\u0003 y(p\u0003;R\u0003)\u0000Q\u0003 y(p\u0003)][1=p\u0003\u00001=pw]orR\u0003=R\u0003(p\u0003;pw)for the foreign coun- try, and where each country\u0092 s tari\u00a4 revenue is an increasing function of its terms 36of trade under the normal-goods assumption. This allows national consumption to be written as Ci(p;pw)\u0011Di(p;R(p;pw))andC\u0003 i(p\u0003;pw)\u0011D\u0003 i(p\u0003;R\u0003(p\u0003;pw)) fori=fx;yg, withCidecreasing in pwandC\u0003 iincreasing in pw. To express the trade balance and equilibrium conditions of the model, I de ne home-country imports of xand exports of ybyMx(p;pw)\u0011Cx(p;pw)\u0000Qx(p)and Ey(p;pw)\u0011Qy(p)\u0000Cy(p;pw), respectively. Similarly, foreign-country imports of y and exports M\u0003 y(p\u0003;pw)\u0011Cy(p\u0003;pw)\u0000Q\u0003 y(p\u0003)andE\u0003 x(p\u0003;pw)\u0011 Q\u0003 x(p\u0003)\u0000C\u0003 the balanced trade conditions, where I now make explicit the dependence of the local price on the tari\u00a4and the world price. The equilibrium world price, epw( ; \u0003), is then determined by the requirement for good y: Ey(p( ;epw);epw) =M\u0003 y(p\u0003( \u0003;epw);epw); (2.3) with market clearing for good ximplied by (2.1), (2.2) and (2.3). Thus, given any pair of tari\u00a4s, the equilibrium world price is determined by (2.3), and the equilibrium world price and the given tari\u00a4s then determine in turn the local prices and thereby the production, consumption, import, export and tari\u00a4 revenue levels. I focus on the standard case and therefore assume that the Lerner and Metzler paradoxes are ruled out, so that10 @epw( ; ; \u0003)) d \u0003: (2.4) For future reference, I note that the rst set of inequalities in (2.4) implies that, if the home tari\u00a4 were reduced by a small amount, there exists a small reduction in the foreign tari\u00a4 \u0003that would hold the equilibrium world price epwconstant. Government objectives I now turn to the speci cation of government objec- tives. The trade policy objectives of real-world governments are diverse, and it is important to allow for this diversity when considering the purpose of a trade 10Bagwell and Staiger (2016, pp 499-501) consider the implications for the purpose of trade agreements when the Metzler and/or Lerner paradoxical cases arise. 37agreement, lest the purpose ascribed to the agreement is unduly limited by the trade policy objectives ascribed to governments. Even in the simple model of a world economy presented here, there are many possible motives for government trade policy intervention that could be entertained. For example, a government might care only about the level of national con- sumption and hence the level of real national income when choosing its tari\u00a4s, either because it is unconcerned about the distribution of income and consump- tion among its citizens, or because it has lump-sum redistributive instruments to handle these concerns. The preferences of such a government in the home country could be represented in the model with the objective function G(Cx;Cy), withG increasing in both arguments. Notice that, as Ci(p;pw)is decreasing in pwfor i2fx;ygas indicated above, I can also write this objective function as G(Cx(p;pw);Cy(p;pw))\u0011W(p;pw) (2.5) whereWis decreasing in pw; and similarly for the foreign government I can write G\u0003(C\u0003 x(p\u0003;pw);C\u0003 y(p\u0003;pw))\u0011W\u0003(p\u0003;pw) (2.6) whereW\u0003is increasing in pwgiven thatC\u0003 in pw. But real-world governments often view tari\u00a4s as a tool to address distributional concerns.11Why would these governments use tari\u00a4s for this purpose, when it is well-known that there are other policy interventions that are in principle bet- ter suited for this task? One reason could be that in practice these governments lack not only the policy ideal of lump-sum taxes, but also any of the other pol- icy instruments that, if available, would typically dominate tari\u00a4s as tools for in\u0087 uencing the distribution of income and preserve the economist\u0092 s case for free trade; and in the context of this limited set of policy options, tari\u00a4s might then be the best available policy response to address these concerns.12Or it could be that, even though some of these policy instruments are technically available to 11These concerns likely re\u0087 ect a combination of a desire of governments to serve some notion of social welfare, as in Corden\u0092 s (1974) \u0093Conservative Social Welfare Function,\u0094 and political economy motives to serve politically favored groups (as in Grossman and Helpman, 1994). 12There are a variety of reasons why as a practical matter such non-tari\u00a4 instruments may not be available to governments, including administrative costs and funding requirements that when taken into account could make these instruments impractical or at least less attractive than tari\u00a4s. See also Rodrik (1987), Drazen and Limao (2008) and Limao and Tovar (2011) on additional reasons why governments may choose to use tari\u00a4s for purposes of redistribution. I discuss the possible role of tari\u00a4s as a tool of industrial policy more generally in chapter 7. 38governments, the welfare of their citizens is determined by more than simply the material standard of living that can be attained with a given level of consumption, and depends as well on the manner in which the income to support this level of consumption is attained, with the receipt of lump-sum transfers or direct subsidy payments diminishing personal dignity in a way that earning income at market prices \u0096even if not the prices that would prevail under free trade \u0096would not. In any event, the fact is that many governments use tari\u00a4s to address distri- butional concerns and more broadly as tools of industrial policy, and therefore choose tari\u00a4s to impact the sectoral pattern of production in their economies for reasons that go beyond how that production translates into real national income and thereby national consumption levels. In terms of the model, these govern- ments would appear to have preferences over where on the production possibilities frontier their economy operates, independently of the national consumption levels that are attained. Such government preferences for the home country could be represented in the model by the objective function G(Cx;Cy;Qx;Qy(Qx)). The distribution and level of factor income measured in local prices would be pinned down for a given choice of Qxand therefore Qy(Qx)on the production possibilities frontier, and conditional on the aggregate level of national consumption CxandCy the home government would then have its own preference ranking over the choice ofQxandQy(Qx)as re\u0087 ected in the function G; and for given QxandQy(Qx) and the factor incomes that are implied, it is again natural that Gis increasing in CxandCy, because when factor incomes are xed, increasing CxandCyamounts to increases in tari\u00a4 revenue according to the national budget constraint. Notice again that I can write this objective function as G(Cx(p;pw);Cy(p;pw);Qx(p);Qy(Qx(p)))\u0011W(p;pw) (2.7) whereWis decreasing in pw. And similarly for the foreign government I can write G\u0003(C\u0003 x(p\u0003;pw);C\u0003 y(p\u0003;pw);Q\u0003 x(p\u0003);Q\u0003 y(Q\u0003 x(p\u0003)))\u0011W\u0003(p\u0003;pw) (2.8) whereW\u0003is increasing in pw. More generally, a government\u0092 s preferences over the sectoral pattern of pro- duction in its economy could arise for reasons of national security, or from the societal bene ts of maintaining a robust middle class with access to stable good- paying jobs that are more prevalent in one sector than they are in another, or from the desire to preserve employment in a region that is dependent on a par- ticular sector, or from the avoidance of sector-speci c negative externalities of 39an \u0093eyesore\u0094variety. Any of these non-pecuniary features could be embedded in the model without changing the formal structure I have outlined above, as long as they do not invalidate the competitive equilibrium conditions that the model assumes or lead to transborder non-pecuniary externalities. And for each of these cases I can once again write the associated home-government objective function as in (2.7) with Wdecreasing in pw, and similarly I can again write the associated foreign-government objective function as in (2.8) with W\u0003increasing in pw. Evidently, in all of the cases I have described, government preferences can be represented in the model with the home-country and foreign-country objective functions expressed in the form W(p;pw)andW\u0003(p\u0003;pw)respectively, where Wis decreasing in pwandW\u0003is increasing in pw, and where the di\u00a4erence across these various government objectives translates into di\u00a4erences in how Wvaries with p and howW\u0003varies with p\u0003.13To capture all of these possibilities in a uni ed framework, I will therefore follow Bagwell and Staiger (1999, 2002) and represent the trade policy objectives of the home and foreign government with the general functionsW(p;pw)andW\u0003(p\u0003;pw), with the only structure placed on WandW\u0003 that, holding its local price xed, each government is assumed to achieve higher welfare when its terms of trade improve:14 @W(p;epw) @epw<0and@W\u0003(p\u0003;epw) @epw>0: (2.9) The purpose of a trade agreement I now turn to the central question of this chapter: What problems would governments want a trade agreement to help them solve? In the absence of a trade agreement, I assume that each government would set its trade policy to maximize its objective function taking as given the tari\u00a4 choice of its trading partner, yielding the home and foreign reaction functions Home Reaction Funcion :Wpdp d +Wpw@epw @ = 2002 pp. 18-21) for an inventory of the formal models of trade policy determination in the economics literature that are captured by this structure. 14See Bagwell and Staiger (2002, pp 19-20) for a description of the change in the home and foreign tari\u00a4 that would increase epwwhile holding xed an economy\u0092 s local price. Throughout, I also impose standard regularity conditions, so that all second-order conditions are globally satis ed and all partial derivatives of WandW\u0003are nite. 40where subscripts denote partial derivatives. The joint solution to (2.10) and (2.11) de nes the noncooperative (Nash) tari\u00a4 pair ( N; \u0003N). Notice that under (2.4) and (2.9), the home-country reaction function (2.10) implies Wp<0while the foreign-country reaction function (2.11) implies W\u0003 p\u0003>0. I will return to this feature of noncooperative tari\u00a4s below. Under a trade agreement, by contrast, I assume that the two governments negotiate to a position on the e\u00a2 ciency frontier, where this frontier is de ned by max ; \u0003W(p( ;epw);epw) (2.12) s:t: W\u0003(p\u0003( \u0003;epw);epw)\u0015\u0016W\u0003; with \u0016W\u0003denoting any feasible level of foreign welfare. The e\u00a2 ciency frontier is characterized by solving (2.12) for each value of \u0016W\u0003, and it traces out the where\u0015is the Lagrange multiplier on the constraint in (2.12). Solving (2.13) for \u0015and substituting the result into (2.14), together with the price de nitions, yields the condition that de nes the locus case of the e\u00a2 ciency locus de ned by (2.15) arises when governments care only about the level of national consumption and hence the level of real national income when choosing their tari\u00a4s. In this case, as I have noted above, we then have that the home and foreign welfare functions W(p;pw) andW\u0003(p\u0003;pw)can be written in the particular form given in (2.5) and (2.6), respectively, and it is direct to show that (2.15) then simpli es to the Mayer (1981) locus of e\u00a2 cient tari\u00a4s de ned by (1 + ) = 1=(1 + \u0003). The Mayer locus includes the point of reciprocal free trade = 0 = \u0003, but it also includes a locus of other e\u00a2 cient pairs of tari\u00a4s in which an import tari\u00a4 in one country is exactly o\u00a4set by an import subsidy of the same magnitude in the other country. 41To understand the conditions for e\u00a2 ciency along the Mayer locus, notice that at any point on the locus we have p= (1 + )epw( ; \u0003) =1 (1 + \u0003) =p\u0003: Hence, along the Mayer locus, tari\u00a4s are adjusted to maintain equality in relative local prices between the home and foreign countries, with di\u00a4erent tari\u00a4 pairs resulting in di\u00a4erent world prices and therefore di\u00a4erent distributions of income across trading partners through shifts in the (positive or negative) tari\u00a4 revenue collected by each country. When W(p;pw)andW\u0003(p\u0003;pw)are not assumed to conform to the particular structure in (2.5) and (2.6), (2.15) still determines the e\u00a2 cient relationship between home and foreign tari\u00a4s, but it need not be the case that this relationship equates relative local prices across trading partners, and it need not be the case that this relationship is satis ed by reciprocal free trade. Continuing now with the general government preferences W(p;pw)andW\u0003(p\u0003;pw) described above, a rst question is whether the noncooperative tari\u00a4 choices are e\u00a2 cient. If they are, then assuming that the two governments have entered into negotiations voluntarily, there is nothing for a trade agreement to do since it can\u0092 t o\u00a4er a Pareto improvement over the noncooperative outcome. Using (2.10) and (2.11) together with (2.4) and (2.9) and the fact that the noncooperative tari\u00a4s implyWp<0andW\u0003 p\u0003>0, it is direct to con rm that the rst-order condition for e\u00a2 ciency given in (2.15) is violated when evaluated at the noncooperative tari\u00a4 pair ( N; more speci cally the left- hand side of (2.15) is strictly negative. This implies that, regardless of which of the underlying motives for tari\u00a4 intervention included in the general government objective functions W(p;pw)andW\u0003(p\u0003;pw)is operative, noncooperative tari\u00a4s aretoo high locus.15And as Bagwell and Staiger (1999, 2002 chapter 2) demonstrate, starting at the Nash equilibrium, mutual gains for governments are therefore possible only if they both cut their tari\u00a4s. Clearly this case for tari\u00a4 liberalization in a trade agreement has nothing to do with the econo- mist\u0092 s case for free trade, since it arises regardless of the underlying motives for trade protection captured in the general government objective functions W(p;pw) 15In particular, the fact that the left-hand side of (2.15) is strictly negative when evaluated at the noncooperative tari\u00a4 pair ( N; \u0003N)means that \u0003Nis too high relative to the level of \u0003 that would be e\u00a2 cient in combination with N, and analogously Nis too high relative to the level of that would be e\u00a2 cient in combination with \u0003N. It is in this sense that noncooperative tari\u00a4s ( ciency locus. 42andW\u0003(p\u0003;pw), and as discussed above many of those motives would violate the assumptions that underlie the case for free trade as an e\u00a2 cient outcome. We may now ask: Why are noncooperative tari\u00a4s ine\u00a2 ciently high? If we can identify the reason, then we can say that addressing this reason is the problem that governments want a trade agreement to help them solve. We can say this because by solving this problem, a trade agreement would bring countries to the e\u00a2 ciency frontier, and at that point there is no possibility of further Pareto gains for the governments. To proceed formally, we need to characterize the di\u00a4erence between the Nash rst-order conditions in (2.10) and (2.11) and the rst-order conditions for e\u00a2 - ciency given in (2.15). To aid in this characterization, it is useful to pick a speci c point on the e\u00a2 ciency locus, and compare the conditions that de ne that pair of e\u00a2 cient tari\u00a4s to the conditions that de ne the pair of Nash tari\u00a4s. A point on the e\u00a2 ciency locus that is particularly illuminating for this purpose is the point that Bagwell and Staiger (1999) call the \u0093political tari\u00a4 ( PO; es Home Political Optimum :Wpdp d = 0,Wp= 0 (2.16) Foreign d \u0003= 0,W\u0003 p\u0003= 0; (2.17) where the second equality in (2.16) and in (2.17) follows from the second set of inequalities in (2.4). In the special case where governments care only about the level of national consumption and hence the level of real national income when choosing their tari\u00a4s, and where the government objectives therefore take the particular form in (2.5) and (2.6), the politically optimal tari\u00a4s correspond to reciprocal free trade, a point on the Mayer locus. That politically optimal tari\u00a4s are e\u00a2 cient as well under the general government objective functions W(p;pw) andW\u0003(p\u0003;pw)described above can be immediately con rmed using (2.16) and (2.17) by noting that, when evaluated at the tari\u00a4 pair ( PO; \u0003PO), the (2.16) and (2.17) to (2.10) and (2.11), it is now also apparent that the noncooperative tari\u00a4s fail to reach the political optimum due to the presence of a single term, Wpw@epw @ , in the home-country reaction curve and a single term,W\u0003 pw@epw @ \u0003, in the foreign country reaction curve. These terms represent the incentive each country has when choosing its tari\u00a4noncooperatively to manipulate the terms of trade in its favor, and thereby to shift a portion of the costs of its tari\u00a4 intervention onto its trading partner. For the home government, this term is the product of two negative terms: the term@epw @ , which is strictly negative as long as the home country is large and therefore has market power on world markets; and the term Wpw, which is also negative and re\u0087 ects the negative income e\u00a4ect of a terms-of-trade deterioration holding local prices in the home economy xed. And as this product is itself positive, its presence in (2.10) drives the home noncooperative tari\u00a4 choice higher than the tari\u00a4 that would imply Wp= 0, ensuring that at the noncooperative tari\u00a4 we in fact have Wp<0as I have observed. For the foreign government, this term is the product of two positive terms: the term@epw @ \u0003, which is strictly positive as long as the foreign country is large and therefore has market power on world markets; and the term W\u0003 pw, which is also positive and re\u0087 ects the positive income e\u00a4ect of a terms-of-trade improvement holding local prices in the foreign economy xed. And as this product is itself also positive, its presence in (2.11) drives the foreign noncooperative tari\u00a4choice higher than the tari\u00a4 that would imply W\u0003 p\u0003= 0, ensuring that at the noncooperative tari\u00a4 we in fact have W\u0003 p\u0003>0as I have observed. The fact that these terms lead the home and foreign government to choose tari\u00a4s in the noncooperative equilibrium that imply Wp<0andW\u0003 p\u0003>0is also revealing. As Bagwell and Staiger (1999, 2002 chapter 4) show, if each govern- ment were o\u00a4ered the opportunity to alter its tari\u00a4 from the noncooperative level without impacting its terms of trade, it would choose to cutits tari\u00a4: the home tari\u00a4 cut would decrease the local relative price pin the home economy according to the second inequality in (2.4), leading to a rise in home welfare in the amount \u0001W=Wp[\u0000@p @ ]>0; and the foreign tari\u00a4 cut would increase the local relative pricep\u0003in the foreign economy according to the second inequality in (2.4), leading to a rise in foreign welfare in the amount \u0001W\u0003=W\u0003 p\u0003[\u0000@p\u0003 @ \u0003]>0. Viewed in this light, it is then clear that it is the ability of each government to shift some of the costs of its tari\u00a4 onto its trading partner through terms-of-trade movements that drives each government to choose the overly high tari\u00a4s that obtain in the noncooperative equilibrium. 44Hence, regardless of which of the underlying motives for tari\u00a4 intervention included in the general government objective functions W(p;pw)andW\u0003(p\u0003;pw)is operative, the purpose of a trade agreement is the same: to eliminate the unilateral incentive that governments have to manipulate their terms of trade, and thereby help governments escape from a terms-of-trade driven prisoner\u0092 s dilemma. Bagwell and Staiger (1999, 2002) make this same point, but from the other di- rection. They observe that the Nash rst-order conditions (2.10) and (2.11) would be converted to the conditions (2.16) and (2.17) if the terms-of-trade manipulation termsWpw@epw @ dropped from (2.10) and (2.11) respectively; and they demonstrate that the conditions (2.16) and (2.17) de ne a point on the e\u00a2 - ciency frontier, which they refer to as the political optimum. They then observe that the politically optimal tari\u00a4s can be interpreted as the tari\u00a4s that would arise under unilateral choices in a hypothetical world in which governments are not motivated by the terms-of-trade implications of their trade policy choices, in the sense that the home government acted as if Wpw\u00110and the foreign govern- ment acted as if W\u0003 pw\u00110. And by showing that the tari\u00a4s selected unilaterally by governments with these hypothetical preferences would satisfy (2.16) and (2.17) and thus be e\u00a2 cient, where the evaluation of e\u00a2 ciency is undertaken with respect to the actual government preferences, they conclude that when governments have objectives that can be represented by the general form W(p;pw)andW\u0003(p\u0003;pw) subject to (2.9), the only rationale for a trade agreement is to eliminate the uni- lateral incentive that governments have to manipulate their terms of trade. Whether politically optimal tari\u00a4s are seen as a particular point on the e\u00a2 - ciency frontier that can be usefully compared to the rst-order conditions that de ne the noncooperative tari\u00a4s as I have emphasized here, or rather as a use- ful hypothetical thought experiment for noncooperative tari\u00a4 choices as in the original Bagwell and Staiger (1999, 2002) presentation, is immaterial. As long as politically optimal tari\u00a4s as de ned by (2.16) and (2.17) are e\u00a2 cient in a given en- vironment, we can conclude from the Nash rst-order conditions (2.10) and (2.11) that the purpose of a trade agreement in that environment is to eliminate the unilateral incentive that governments have to manipulate their terms of trade.16 Positive, but also normative? Now is a good time to pause and consider a question that has been lurking behind the approach that I have adopted for 16Notice that I have said nothing about whether a trade agreement would actually implement the political optimum, only that the politically optimal tari\u00a4s are useful as a comparator to noncooperative tari\u00a4s when evaluating the purpose of a trade agreement. 45identifying the purpose of a trade agreement. I have accepted the sovereign right of each national government to de ne its own policy preferences. I have then characterized the task that a trade agreement must accomplish if it is to eliminate the international ine\u00a2 ciencies associated with unilateral policy choices as judged by the preferences of the member governments. I have called this task the purpose of a trade agreement. As the GATT/WTO is a member-driven organization and as the members are national governments, this seems a reasonable approach from which to draw positive conclusions about the purpose of a trade agreement. But does this approach also have normative implications? Is it enough for the world trading system to serve the interests of its member governments ? Can a case for the legitimacy of the GATT/WTO be built around a demonstration that it is well-designed to serve these interests, where by legitimacy I have in mind a \u0093right to rule\u0094concept along the lines articulated by Buchanan and Keohane (2006)?17 If national governments were always and everywhere the faithful servants of their citizens, where the desires of their citizens were aggregated into policy di- rectives for the governments through political processes that their citizens saw as legitimate, then the answers to these questions would clearly be \u0093Yes.\u0094But most real-world governments operate far from this ideal. And so, in the real world, the answers are not so clear. Looking to the international political economy literature for guidance on these questions provides a mixed view. On the speci c question of what determines the legitimacy of an international institution, Peter (2017) notes that there are two approaches in the literature, a \u0093state-centered\u0094approach and a \u0093people-centered\u0094 approach. Beitz (1979, p. 408) describes the state-centered approach as one in which \u0093international society is understood as domestic society writ large, with states playing the roles occupied by persons in domestic society.\u0094In the people- centered approach, it is instead the welfare of individuals that is taken as the basis for the determination of an international institution\u0092 s legitimacy (see Buchanan, 2003). If the purpose of a trade agreement that I have identi ed above can be interpreted as having normative relevance, then establishing a claim of legitimacy for the GATT/WTO based on a demonstration that it is well-designed to serve this purpose falls squarely on the state-centered approach: under this interpretation, 17Buchanan and Keohane (2006, p. 411) de ne legitimacy in the case of global governance institutions as \u0093the right to rule, understood to mean both that institutional agents are morally justi ed in making rules and attempting to secure compliance with them and that people subject to those rules have moral, content-independent reasons to follow them and/or to not interfere with others\u0092compliance with them.\u0094See also Franck (1990). 46like consumers in a domestic context the preferences of national governments are taken as sovereign in the international context, and the legitimacy of a trade agreement is judged on its ability to deliver e\u00a2 cient outcomes where e\u00a2 ciency is assessed using the preferences of the member governments.18This interpretation seems tenuous, but what are the viable alternatives? One possibility would be to dispense completely with the nation-state as the unit of observation for normative purposes, and to evaluate the legitimacy of the GATT/WTO based on how close the agreement comes to maximizing a global social welfare function de ned over the welfare of individuals. This would amount to a people-centered approach. For example, the GATT/WTO\u0092 s design might be judged with a criterion based on a utilitarian ideal, where global welfare is measured by the sum of the utilities across all individuals in the world and where each individual\u0092 s utility enters that sum with an equal weight.19Or a Rawl- sian criterion, under which global social welfare is only as high as the utility of the least-well-o\u00a4 individual on the planet, might be used to judge the design of the agreement. As a general matter it is of course important to know how an agreement performs according to these normative benchmarks. But as a means to evaluate the legitimacy of the GATT/WTO these benchmarks seem unwork- able, because to proceed with such an evaluation would require that a consensus emerge regarding the correct normative benchmark, and it seems unlikely that such a consensus could ever exist.20 Another possibility for assessing legitimacy would be a hybrid approach some- where in between the state-centered and people-centered approaches, maintain- ing the nation-state as the unit of observation but including more interests from each nation in the global social welfare function than simply the interests of each member government. Such an approach might, for example, mirror the \u0093tripar- tite\u0094structure of national representation in the International Labor Organization (ILO), where each member country is represented by three national interests: its government, its workers, and its employers. The analog for assessing the legiti- 18To be clear, while this approach can be described as state-centered, it is otherwise distinct from the approaches to evaluating legitimacy featured in the international political economy literature and reviewed in Peter (2017), as it uses a di\u00a4erent set of (state-centered) criteria. 19See Maggi and Ossa (2020) for an approach to evaluating the normative properties of a trade agreement along these lines. 20Partly the di\u00a2 culty in reaching a consensus on this matter rests with the fact that it involves value judgements over which there will always be disagreements. And partly the di\u00a2 culty can be traced to disagreements over factual matters, such as the importance of market failures and the array of policy instruments that real-world governments have to pursue their objectives. 47macy of the GATT/WTO might be to include in the global social welfare function used in that assessment representatives of government, exporter and importer in- terests in each member country (or possibly government, producer and consumer interests). But again a consensus on the appropriate representation would be needed to make this approach workable.21 In light of these consideration, it is useful to think of the question of the legitimacy of the world trading system as applying at two levels. First, at the international level there is the question whether the GATT/WTO can be seen as legitimate from the perspective of the member governments. And second, at the national level there is the question whether the member governments can be seen as legitimate from the perspective of their own citizens. If both questions can be answered in the a\u00a2 rmative, then the GATT/WTO can be said to be legitimate from both the state-centered and the people-centered perspective. But as trade agreements are fundamentally government-to-government contracts, the key question of legitimacy for the GATT/WTO as an international institution \u0096 and the only question whose answer it has any meaningful control over \u0096relates to the rst question, not the second. My approach in this book is to therefore focus on the answer to the rst question \u0096 Does the GATT/WTO have the moral authority to make rules and attempt to secure compliance with those rules from its member governments, or not? \u0096 and to acknowledge that an answer to this question can provide only part of the answer to the larger question of the legitimacy of the world trading system. But it is an important part of the answer. If this rst question cannot be answered in the a\u00a2 rmative, then it is hard to see how the GATT/WTO could remain viable, since it would presumably lack support from the governments who are its members. And if this question can be answered in the a\u00a2 rmative, then the central international task in designing a constitution for the world trading system has been accomplished with the design of the GATT/WTO. And with this state-centered task accomplished, attention could then be focused on the task of establishing that each national government satis es agreed criteria for legitimacy, 21There is also another issue raised by moving away from a state-centered approach to evalu- ating the legitimacy of a trade agreement: if interests beyond those of the member governments are to be represented in a trade agreement, how are commitments that serve those interests but not also the interests of the member governments to be enforced? This issue seems germane for the GATT/WTO, where enforcement ultimately comes down to tari\u00a4 retaliation and govern- ments hold the levers of this enforcement mechanism, and it may explain why under the ILO\u0092 s tripartite representation (unique among United Nations agencies) no member state is under any obligation to ratify any ILO convention or recommendation (see Johnston, 1970, p. 90). 48thereby ensuring that the world trading system so designed could be said to be legitimate from a people-centered perspective as well. Generality Thus far I have emphasized the wide array of government objectives that are consistent with the conclusion that the purpose of a trade agreement is to eliminate the unilateral incentive that governments have to manipulate their terms of trade. But I have maintained a very particular and simple economic en- vironment within which to derive these results. How dependent is this conclusion on the economic environment within which governments operate? An immediate implication of the discussion above is that this conclusion does depend on gov- ernments having a complete set of trade taxes at their disposal. This can be seen from the de nition of politically optimal tari\u00a4s, which in general requires the use of both and \u0003to satisfy the two conditions in (2.16) and (2.17).22As has been emphasized by Ossa (2011) and Bagwell and Staiger (2012, 2015, 2016), when limitations are placed on the trade taxes that governments possess, di\u00a4erent roles for a trade agreement can arise. That said, some of the most salient restrictions on trade tax/subsidy instruments are associated with commitments made as a result of trade agreements (e.g., to restrict the use of export subsidies), and it is not clear that such restrictions should be taken as given when attempting to identify the underlying purpose of trade agreements as is my intent here. Beyond the assumption that governments have a complete set of trade taxes, however, the conclusion that the purpose of a trade agreement is to eliminate the unilateral incentive that governments have to manipulate their terms of trade is surprisingly robust to alternative economic environments. It holds in a many- country version of the model I have outlined above provided that tari\u00a4s are im- posed on a nondiscriminatory (MFN) basis (see Bagwell and Staiger, 1999, 2002), and it holds in partial equilibrium versions of these models (see Bagwell and Staiger, 2001a). It holds in competitive environments for trade in goods or trade 22An exception to this is when the government objective functions take the particular form in (2.5) and (2.6) and the politically optimal tari\u00a4s correspond to reciprocal free trade, a point on the Mayer locus. In this case, if only one of the two governments had access to a tari\u00a4, it could still be concluded that the purpose of a trade agreement is to eliminate the unilateral incentive that this government has to manipulate its terms of trade, because at the political optimum neither government imposes a tari\u00a4 so it is immaterial that one of them does not have access to a tari\u00a4. Also, to be clear, notice that for the arguments in the text to remain valid there is no requirement that governments have a complete set of taxinstruments, only that they have a complete set of trade taxes. Staiger and Sykes (2021) explore the lack of available trade taxes that arises with mode 3services trade; I review their ndings in chapter 9. 49in services when governments have access to regulatory standards and/or addi- tional domestic tax/subsidy policies (see Bagwell and Staiger, 2001b, and Staiger and Sykes, 2011, for trade in goods, and Staiger and Sykes, 2021, for trade in services). And it holds in models of Cournot or monopolistic competition with homogeneous rms (see Bagwell and Staiger, 2002 chapter 9, 2012a,b, 2015) and in models of monopolistic competition with heterogeneous rms (see Bagwell and Lee, 2020, Campolmi, Fadinger and Forlati, 2020, and Costinot, Rodriguez-Clare and Werning, 2016, 2020). For this reason, it is useful to adopt a common short- hand for referring to models that share this prediction about the purpose of a trade agreement, and I will follow Bagwell and Staiger\u0092 s (2002) terminology and sometimes make use of the phrase \u0093terms-of-trade theory of trade agreements\u0094as a catchall for models of this kind.23 This is not to say that preventing terms-of-trade manipulation is the only possible purpose for a trade agreement. Indeed, as I noted at the outset of this chapter, I am intentionally abstracting from the possibility that a trade agreement could serve as a policy commitment device for its member governments when those governments struggle to make policy commitments to their private sectors on their own. And as I will review in later chapters, the arguments I have made here do not extend to all economic environments; and as I alluded to in chapter 1, some of the environments where these arguments do not extend may be more important in the twenty- rst century than they were in the twentieth century, raising the possibility of an evolution of the purpose of trade agreements over time. But as I have illustrated here, these arguments do apply in a remarkably broad set of circumstances, suggesting that a trade agreement that is designed well to solve the terms-of-trade manipulation problem will be a very useful trade agreement to its member governments. From this perspective, it is therefore meaningful when assessing the reasons for GATT\u0092 s success and determining the basis for its legitimacy to evaluate the degree to which its design features are well-equipped to serve this function. It is to this evaluation that I now turn. 3. What Do Trade Negotiators Negotiate About? In chapter 2 I presented formal arguments that point to the elimination of terms- of-trade manipulation as the central purpose of a trade agreement, and I suggested that this provides a natural dimension on which to evaluate the design features 23But see Grossman (2016) for a di\u00a4erent perspective on this terminology. 50of GATT: How well-designed is GATT to help its member governments solve the terms-of-trade manipulation problem and thereby escape from a terms-of- trade driven prisoner\u0092 s dilemma? In this and the next two chapters I evaluate GATT\u0092 s design as it relates to tari\u00a4 bargaining, the foundational activity in the GATT/WTO. After some preliminaries, I begin this evaluation by asking what negotiators negotiate about in the GATT/WTO. If there is no evidence that these negotiations serve to remove the imprint of market power from unilateral tari\u00a4 choices, then there is little point in asking whether the design features of the GATT/WTO can be interpreted as helping to serve this purpose. 3.1. Preliminaries Three of the most basic features of GATT tari\u00a4 negotiations raise questions about the wisdom of GATT\u0092 s design and the negotiating behavior it induces, and pose an immediate challenge to the terms-of-trade theory if these features are to be interpreted through the lens of that theory. Why do governments adopt a mer- cantilist approach in GATT/WTO negotiations, viewing their own tari\u00a4 cuts as \u0093concessions\u0094to be granted only in return for foreign tari\u00a4 cuts from their trading partners? What accounts for the emphasis on market access that permeates the language of GATT/WTO tari\u00a4 negotiations? And how can governments hope to achieve meaningful bene ts from GATT/WTO negotiations anyway, if their ne- gotiations are focused narrowly on tari\u00a4s to the exclusion of the myriad other gov- ernment interventions that can also have trade e\u00a4ects? Since any model of trade agreements that purports to capture the underlying logic of the GATT/WTO must be able to account for these basic features of GATT tari\u00a4 negotiations, I be- gin this chapter by considering how these three questions can be answered within the modeling framework of chapter 2. If tari\u00a4 negotiations begin from the noncooperative tari\u00a4 choices characterized by (2.10) and (2.11), the rst question has an immediate answer: beginning from their tari\u00a4 reaction curves, governments should view anychange in their own tari\u00a4s as a concession, to be granted only in return for something that they would value from their negotiating partner; and as Bagwell and Staiger (1999, 2002 chapter 4) show and as I described in chapter 2, from this starting point each government would indeed gain from at least a small cutin its own tari\u00a4, if its trading partner agreed to reciprocate with a tari\u00a4cut of its own that was calibrated to preserve the terms of trade between them (and recall from the rst inequality in (2.4) that it is indeed a downward movement in the trading partner\u0092 s tari\u00a4 51that would achieve this). Hence, while the government behavior singled out by this rst question might seem surprising and somehow mercantilist if one took the view that the logic of trade negotiations should be based on the case for free trade, from the perspective of the terms-of-trade theory of trade agreements embodied in the modeling framework of chapter 2 this behavior is not surprising at all: there is no other way that governments could behave.24 The answers to the second and third questions are related to each other, and more nuanced. A rst observation is that GATT tari\u00a4 negotiations are indeed considered negotiations over market access , with tari\u00a4 commitments treated as commitments to conditions of competition in the domestic market between domes- tic producers and foreign suppliers.25I have developed the modeling framework of chapter 2 without reference to the phrase \u0093market access restrictions,\u0094making use instead of the phrase \u0093terms-of-trade improvement.\u0094But as Bagwell and Staiger (2002, pp 28-30) have shown, a direct link between these two phrases is easily forged: when the home government raises its import tari\u00a4 and thereby shifts in its import demand curve, the consequent \u0093price e\u00a4ect\u0094(i.e., the home country\u0092 s terms-of-trade improvement) has a corresponding \u0093volume e\u00a4ect\u0094(i.e., the foreign country\u0092 s reduction in access to the home market). Viewed from this perspective, the terms-of-trade theory has no di\u00a2 culty accounting for the fact that real-world negotiators emphasize the market-access implications of trade policy.26 To illustrate the point more formally, I follow Bagwell and Staiger (2002, pp 28-30) and, for a given world price pwand home tari\u00a4 , de ne the market ac- cess that the home country a\u00a4ords to the foreign country by the home-country import demand function evaluated at that world price and home tari\u00a4 level, Mx(p( ;pw);pw); and similarly, given a world price pwand a foreign tari\u00a4 \u0003, I de ne the market access that the foreign country a\u00a4ords to the home country byM\u0003 y(p\u0003( \u0003;pw);pw). Let us now say that a government secures additional mar- 24Bagwell and Staiger (2002, pp 191-192) provide the proof in this setting that a trade agree- ment must entail tari\u00a4 cuts by each country if it is to improve upon the noncooperative welfare levels for each country. 25As a GATT/WTO legal matter, market access is de ned by the competitive relationship between imported and domestically produced products, and a negotiated tari\u00a4 commitment is treated as a commitment to a particular competitive relationship between imported and domestic products and hence a market access commitment. 26This emphasis can be seen, for example, in the following excerpt from a GATT dispute panel report (as quoted in Petersmann, 1997, p. 168): \u0093...the main value of a tari\u00a4 concession is that it provides assurance of better market access through improved price competition. Contracting parties negotiate tari\u00a4 concessions primarily to obtain that advantage.\u0094 52ket access from its trading partner through negotiations if the trading partner\u0092 s negotiated policy changes shift out its import demand curve for at least some world price. According to this de nition, if the home government were to fail to secure additional market access as a result of the foreign government\u0092 s agreed policy changes, then the foreign import demand curve would shift in (weakly) at all world price levels and lead to a (weakly) higher equilibrium world price epwand therefore a terms-of-trade loss (weakly) for the home country, assuming that the Marshall-Lerner stability conditions are met. With the link between changes in market access and changes in the terms of trade established, the ndings of the terms-of-trade theory can be translated into the language of market access. For instance, it may be con rmed (see Bagwell and Staiger, 2001b) that the essential ine\u00a2 arising the noncooperative tari\u00a4 choices characterized by (2.10) and (2.11) can be described as one of insu\u00a2 cient market access. Hence, the modeling framework of chapter 2 provides a rationale for why governments would emphasize the market-access implications of trade policy and seek to expand market access in their tari\u00a4 negotiations. This answers the second question posed above. In answer to the third question, a starting point is to observe that, while gov- ernments do focus narrowly on tari\u00a4s in their market access negotiations, it is not true that this focus is to the exclusion of the myriad other government interven- tions that can also have trade e\u00a4ects through their impacts on the conditions of competition. Indeed, it is the purpose of many of the GATT Articles which lay down the code of conduct that I described in chapter 2 to ensure that non-tari\u00a4 policy interventions do not unilaterally alter the market access implications of a negotiated tari\u00a4 commitment, and thereby to secure the property rights over negotiated market access that a tari\u00a4 commitment implies.27 The real issue raised by this third question, then, is whether governments can negotiate to the e\u00a2 ciency frontier under the shallow approach to liberalization that GATT embodies, whereby governments negotiate only over tari\u00a4s and where the tari\u00a4 commitments they make translate into market access commitments as a result of the accompanying GATT Articles. Is it possible to reach the e\u00a2 ciency frontier with respect to allgovernment policies when governments negotiate di- rectly only over tari\u00a4s in this way? As I next demonstrate, the answer according to the terms-of-trade theory is, at least in principle, \u0093Yes.\u0094 To this end, I now extend the modeling framework sketched out in chapter 2 to allow governments to also choose regulatory standards. To keep things simple, 27As Petersmann (1997, p. 136) observes, \u0093...the function of most GATT rules (such as Articles I-III and XI) is to establish conditions of competition and to protect trading opportunities...\u0094 . 53I will focus on a production standard, such as a minimum legal working age or a maximum legal emissions level per unit of output, which might be applied to a particular sector or on an economy-wide basis, and which could potentially alter the shape of the country\u0092 s production possibilities frontier and hence, for given local prices, its production choices. Below I sketch arguments that can be found in more detail in Bagwell and Staiger (2001b).28 Letting\u001bdenote the standard in the home country and \u001b\u0003the standard in the foreign country, it is direct to show that introducing these standards into the modeling framework of chapter 2 will result in two changes to the model. First, the equilibrium world price determined by the market clearing condition now takes the formepw=epw(\u001b;\u001b\u0003; ; \u0003): that is, in addition to its tari\u00a4, a country\u0092 s standard also impacts the equilibrium world price through its impact on the country\u0092 s production possibilities frontier. And second, as each government may have its own reasons to set its standard, the home and foreign government objectives are now represented respectively by W(\u001b;p( ;epw);epw)andW\u0003(\u001b\u0003;p\u0003( \u0003;epw);epw)with @W(\u001b;p;epw) @epw<0and@W\u0003(\u001b\u0003;p\u0003;epw) @epw>0 but otherwise left before. Importantly, as the government objec- tives re\u0087 ect, I am assuming the absence of cross-border non-pecuniary externali- ties associated with standards choices, so that neither government cares directly about the standard chosen by the other government, but only indirectly through the possible trade e\u00a4ects of that choice. I am therefore excluding the possibility that the government of one country might care about how weak labor standards in its trading partner would impact the welfare of the trading partner\u0092 s work force, but I am including the possibility that this government might care about the trade e\u00a4ects of the trading partner\u0092 s weak labor standards and be concerned that these trade e\u00a4ects could fuel \u0093race-to-the-bottom\u0094pressures which led to the adoption of weak labor standards also in its own country. It is direct to show that (2.15) continues to provide the condition for e\u00a2 cient tari\u00a4s in this extended setting. And when combined with this condition, the 28These arguments have been extended to the case of domestic production subsidies and to the case of competition policy by Bagwell and Staiger (2006) and Bagwell and Staiger (2002, chapter 9), respectively, and to the case of product standards and domestic production and consumption taxes/subsidies by Staiger and Sykes (2011) for trade in goods and by Staiger and Sykes (2021) for trade in services. I will discuss environments where these arguments do not hold, as pointed out by Antras and Staiger (2012a, 2012b) and Grossman, McCalman and Staiger (2021), in chapters 10 and 11 respectively. 54 rst-order conditions that the e\u00a2 cient standards must satisfy can be written as: W\u001b+Wpdp attained when tari\u00a4s satisfy (2.15) and stan- dards satisfy (3.1) and (3.2). The interpretation of (3.1) and (3.2) is central to understanding why a shallow approach to integration can work in this setting. Consider the rst-order condition for the e\u00a2 cient choice of the home-country standard\u001b. According to (3.1), \u001bshould be chosen to maximize the welfare of the home government when the home government also adjusts its tari\u00a4 so as to ensure that the equilibrium world price epwdoes not change. The reason this standards choice is e\u00a2 cient is that, provided that epwis not altered, the foreign government is indi\u00a4erent to both the level of and the level of \u001bthat the home government chooses, as can be con rmed by inspection of the foreign govern- ment\u0092 s welfare function W\u0003(\u001b\u0003;p\u0003( \u0003;epw);epw); and so e\u00a2 ciency demands that the home government should also be indi\u00a4erent to small changes in \u001bthat, with the accompanying changes in de ned in (3.1), preserve epw. But recalling now the de nition of market access introduced above, it is clear that the changes in \u001band that preserve epware simply those changes that hold xed the position of the home import demand curve evaluated at the initial equilibrium world price epw, and hence amount to changes in \u001band that preserve the market access evaluated at the initial equilibrium world price epwthat the home government has granted to the foreign government through their tari\u00a4 negotiations. In this light, it can now be seen that a focus on tari\u00a4 negotiations to achieve e\u00a2 cient levels of market access, in combination with a code of conduct spelled out in a set of GATT Articles that ensure that non-tari\u00a4 policy interventions cannot unilaterally alter the market access implied of a tari\u00a4 commitment, contains all the ingredients to allow governments, at least in principle, to reach the e\u00a2 ciency frontier in their settings of both tari\u00a4s andstandards. In particular, as Bagwell and Staiger (2001b) demonstrate, if governments were to negotiate over tari\u00a4s alone, and if they were then permitted to make unilateral standards choices while also compelled by GATT\u0092 s \u0093market access preservation rules\u0094to accompany these standards choices with tari\u00a4 adjustments that preserve the market access implied by their negotiated tari\u00a4 selections, then they would negotiate tari\u00a4s that satisfy (2.15) and make standards choices that satisfy (3.1) and (3.2). Evidently, with 55these \u0093shallow\u0094negotiations the governments would reach the e\u00a2 ciency frontier, and the terms-of-trade theory thereby provides a strong foundation for a shallow approach to negotiated trade liberalization.29 Notice also that the terms-of-trade theory provides an interpretation, with a twist, of the common observation that GATT began with the \u0093low hanging fruit\u0094 of tari\u00a4 liberalization and only later had to confront the more di\u00a2 cult task of dealing with behind-the-border measures. The twist is that, according to the terms-of-trade theory, the fundamental problem for a trade agreement to address has not changed; it is simply that as tari\u00a4s were negotiated downward, the pressure to distort behind-the-border policies for ine\u00a2 cient terms-of-trade manipulation reasons grew, and the initial GATT rules that were supposed to ensure a code of conduct in the international-trade arena to prevent such behavior proved inadequate for the task. The result has been a growing focus over time on addressing the trade distorting aspects of non-tari\u00a4 barriers. Importantly, what is revealed under this interpretation is that there are two plausible ways to respond to this challenge. One response is to give up on GATT\u0092 s shallow approach to integration and the rules applying to behind-the-border measures that were meant to facilitate that approach, and to pursue instead deep integration. But an alternative response, and one which as a matter of principle the terms-of-trade theory puts on equal footing, is to maintain GATT\u0092 s basic approach and work to strengthen the rules that could facilitate shallow integration. Finally, it should be acknowledged that I have abstracted from a number of challenges that a shallow approach to integration must overcome in practice; and in reality the line between shallow and deep integration is not as stark as the model above makes it out to be. At a more practical level, therefore, the message of the terms-of-trade theory is not so much that nodegree of deep integration is necessary to reach the e\u00a2 ciency frontier, but rather that the market access orientation of the GATT/WTO can provide a potentially useful guardrail to delineate the \u0093depth\u0094 of integration that trade agreements should be willing to contemplate in order to reach the e\u00a2 ciency frontier: according to the terms-of-trade theory, there is no reason for a trade agreement to go deeper than what is required to ensure 29What is not provided by the arguments I have reviewed here is a formal explanation for why governments would prefer this method of liberalization to the alternative of deep integration where the governments negotiate directly over all policies, both tari\u00a4s and non-tari\u00a4instruments. In Chapter 12 I will suggest one possible explanation. Also, while there is a basic a\u00a2 nity between the theoretical arguments I have presented here and the shallow approach to trade liberalization embodied in GATT/WTO rules, see Bagwell and Staiger (2001b) for modi cations to GATT/WTO rules that would more closely align those rules with these theoretical arguments. 56that property rights over negotiated market access are reasonably secure. Such a guardrail can help governments avoid con\u0087 icts between globalization and national sovereignty that, according to the terms-of-trade theory, would be unnecessary. This answers the third question posed above. With these most basic questions addressed, I now turn to the central question of this chapter: What do trade negotiators negotiate about? 3.2. Evidence from WTO accession negotiations If the GATT/WTO is well-designed to help its member governments escape from a terms-of-trade driven prisoner\u0092 s dilemma, there should be evidence of this in the pattern of tari\u00a4 cuts that the member governments agree to in a GATT/WTO ne- gotiation. Looking for such evidence would be simple if all governments sought to maximize the real national income of their citizens with their tari\u00a4 choices and ne- gotiations were assumed to take governments to the political optimum: one might simply look to see how close governments got to reciprocal free trade as a result of their negotiations. But when governments have diverse preferences over trade policy, such as is re\u0087 ected in the objective functions that I have adopted in the modeling framework of chapter 2, things are not as straightforward. According to the terms-of-trade theory, if governments are able to negotiate to the political op- timum, what should remain after the GATT/WTO negotiations are completed is the portion of each government\u0092 s noncooperative tari\u00a4 choices that are not driven by the international cost shifting that is associated with terms-of-trade manipu- lation. The challenge in evaluating the performance of GATT/WTO negotiations is then to disentangle these two components of noncooperative tari\u00a4s, so that the magnitude of the cost-shifting component re\u0087 ected in the noncooperative tari\u00a4 levels can be compared to the magnitude of the negotiated tari\u00a4 cuts. Of course, this all presupposes that governments would be caught in a terms- of-trade driven prisoner\u0092 s dilemma in the absence of tari\u00a4 negotiations, which in turn requires that countries possess signi cant and widespread market power in world markets, and that the unilateral tari\u00a4 choices of governments re\u0087 ect the market power that they possess. Broda, Limao and Weinstein (2008) provided the rst systematic evidence on these prior questions, and as I noted in chapter 1 they nd strong evidence that countries routinely have market power in their import markets and use it in setting noncooperative trade policy.30Here I focus 30For a review of the broader empirical literature on these questions, see Bagwell, Bown and Staiger (2016). Recently a number of papers have exploited the aggressive use of tari\u00a4s by 57on the pattern of tari\u00a4 liberalization in GATT/WTO negotiations. I describe the ndings of Bagwell and Staiger (2011), who explore whether the observed tari\u00a4 cuts in WTO accession negotiations conform with the tari\u00a4cuts that, according to the terms-of-trade theory, would deliver governments to the political optimum.31 To identify the portion of a government\u0092 s noncooperatively chosen tari\u00a4 level that is driven by international cost shifting, I now return to the expressions for the noncooperative tari\u00a4s and the politically optimal tari\u00a4s presented in chapter 2. Focusing on the home government, the expression for the noncooperative tari\u00a4 in (2.10) can be rewritten as Home Reaction Funcion :Wp=\u0000Wpw\u0014@epw=@ dp=d \u0015 ; while recall that the politically optimal tari\u00a4 for the home government is de ned in (2.16) by the condition Home Political Optimum :Wp= 0: I impose the assumption that Wpp<0holds globally over nonprohibitive tari\u00a4s. This condition must hold as long as Wis globally concave over nonprohibitive tari\u00a4s even if the home country is small on world markets, so that there exists a unique solution to the home government\u0092 s unilateral welfare-maximizing tari\u00a4 choice. And I assume for the moment that if the home government were to cut its tari\u00a4 from its reaction-curve level to its politically optimal level, the foreign government would respond with a tari\u00a4 cut that was calibrated to hold the equi- librium world price epwconstant. I can then write the di\u00a4erence between the home government\u0092 s noncooperative government\u0092 s \u0093best\u0096 response\u0094 any H(0) = 0 andHis a decreasing func- tion, and where all the magnitudes on the right-hand side of (3.3) are evaluated the Trump Administration and the tari\u00a4 responses of its trading partners to investigate how local and world prices respond to the imposition of tari\u00a4s (see, for example, Amiti, Redding and Weinstein, 2019, Fajgelbaum, Goldberg, Kennedy and Khandelwal, 2020, and Cavallo, Gopinath, Neiman and Tang, 2021). I discuss the ndings of these papers in the context of material presented in chapter 5. 31See Bagwell and Staiger (2016, pp 488-492) for a discussion of why the political optimum, among all possible points on the e\u00a2 ciency frontier, might be viewed as a natural focal outcome of GATT/WTO negotiations. 58at the noncooperative tari\u00a4 level BR. Finally, rearranging (3.3) delivers an ex- pression for the home government\u0092 s politically optimal tari\u00a4, expressed in terms the term \u0000Wpwh @epw=@ dp=d i evaluated at the s noncooperative tari\u00a4 choice, as the determinant of the component of the home government\u0092 s noncooperative tari\u00a4 that is attributable to terms-of-trade manipulation and the international cost-shifting that it represents, and therefore as the determinant of the magnitude of the tari\u00a4 cut which according to (3.3) is required to move the home government from its noncooperative tari\u00a4 choice to its politically optimal level. This term, which is weakly negative under (2.4) and (2.9), is composed of three sub-terms, each with a ready interpretation. The home country\u0092 s market power on world import markets is re\u0087 ected in @epw=@ , with (3.4) implying that PO= BRwhen the home country is small on world markets and @epw=@ = 0, and with POfalling further below BRas the market power of the home country rises and @epw=@ becomes increasingly negative. This market power e\u00a4ect is tempered by the magnitude of dp=d , which re\u0087 ects the size of the domestic distortion introduced by the home tari\u00a4 and keeps POcloser to BRwhen this distortion, and hence dp=d , is higher. Finally, \u0000Wpwre\u0087 ects the value that the home government places on a small improvement in its terms of trade; with its local prices held xed when evaluating \u0000Wpw, this amounts to the degree to which the home government values the extra tari\u00a4 revenue that is generated by the fall in pwand the implied rise in =p pw\u00001, all evaluated at BR. Notice that, as BRapproaches the prohibitive level and home imports shrink toward zero, \u0000Wpwapproaches zero (because the import volume on which tari\u00a4 revenue is earned approaches zero) and POapproaches BRfrom below. In order to take relationships like (3.3) and (3.4) to the data, Bagwell and Staiger work with a partial equilibrium many-good many-country version of the model of chapter 2 where income e\u00a4ects are absent. Under MFN tari\u00a4s, there continues to be a common world price epgwfaced by all countries for each good g. For simplicity, I continue for now to couch the discussion in terms of a two-country home-and-foreign world, and only introduce notation for the many-country version of the model when that notation is needed. In the partial equilibrium version of the model where all tari\u00a4 revenue is spent on the numeraire good, the relationships in (3.3) and (3.4) hold for each non- 59numeraire good g, imports of good gdepend only on the local price of good g, andWpwg=\u0000Mg(pg( g;epw g)), re\u0087 ecting the fact that the magnitude of the (nega- tive) income e\u00a4ect of a small deterioration in the home country\u0092 s terms of trade for goodg, holding its local price of good g xed, is given by the volume of its imports of good g. Bagwell and Staiger then show that for home import good g, the termWpwh @epw=@ dp=d i that enters (3.3) and (3.4) can equivalently asMBR g pBRgh !BR g \u0011\u0003BRgi , where!BR gis elasticity of home import demand (de ned pos- itively) for good gand\u0011\u0003BR gis the elasticity of foreign export supply of good g, and where the superscript BRindicates that the variable is evaluated at the best-response home tari\u00a4 BR gfor import good g. A particularly simple form of these relationships arises when demand and supply curves are linear. In this case, and focusing on (3.3), the di\u00a4erence BR g\u0000 PO gis proportional toMBR g epwBRg: that is, according to the terms-of-trade theory, if governments use their GATT/WTO negotiations to move from noncooperative tari\u00a4s to the point on the e\u00a2 ciency frontier at which they each adopt politically optimal tari\u00a4s, then when demands and supplies are linear their negotiated tari\u00a4 cuts should rise proportionately with the ratio of pre-negotiation (noncooperative) import volume to world price. A challenge in taking these predictions to the data is that they are developed in a static model where tari\u00a4negotiations are conceived as a one-o\u00a4event that carries countries from their noncooperative tari\u00a4 choices to the politically optimal tari\u00a4s. In fact, as I have described in chapter 2, there have been eight completed rounds of GATT negotiations spanning many decades and culminating in 1995 with the completion of the Uruguay Round and the creation of the WTO. This gradual liberalization process complicates the possibility of a straightforward application of the predictions embodied in (3.3) and (3.4) to the observed negotiated tari\u00a4 cuts of the GATT/WTO membership. To overcome this challenge, Bagwell and Staiger focus on a set of non-GATT- member countries who joined the WTO in separate accession negotiations occur- ring after the Uruguay Round was completed. These accession negotiations come close to the one-o\u00a4 negotiating events that the model envisions. The maintained hypothesis is that, at the time of these negotiations, existing GATT/WTO mem- bers had largely completed the process of negotiating their tari\u00a4s to politically optimal levels, and new members were therefore asked to agree to once-for-all tar- i\u00a4 cuts from best-response to politically optimal levels in exchange for the rights of WTO membership. A limitation of this focus is that it excludes from the evaluation of GATT/WTO tari\u00a4 liberalization the major industrialized countries, 60who were all original or early GATT members and who historically have been the dominant actors in GATT/WTO tari\u00a4 negotiations. I will return to this point below. Figures 3.1 and 3.2 (reproduced from Bagwell and Staiger, 2011) con rm that the patterns of tari\u00a4 liberalization predicted by (3.3) are present in the data. Figure 3.1 (Reproduced from Bagwell and Staiger, 2011) Figure 3.2 (Reproduced from Bagwell and Staiger, 2011) For a sample of 16countries that negotiated membership in the WTO subse- quent to its creation in 1995, Figure 3.1 plots the percent deviation from mean negotiated tari\u00a4 cut against the decile of pre-negotiation import volume to world price,MBR gc epwBRg, where the subscript cnow indexes and the subscriptgrefers to a six-digit Harmonized System (HS) product. Evidently, negotiated tari\u00a4 cuts rise in a roughly proportional way with normalized pre- 61negotiation import volumeMBR gc epwBRg, as is predicted by the version of (3.3) that ap- plies to a partial equilibrium model where demands and supplies are linear. And for a sample of 5of these countries where estimates of !BR gcand\u0011\u0003BR gcfrom Broda, Limao and Weinstein (2008) are available, Figure 3.2 plots the percent deviation from mean negotiated tari\u00a4 cut as the terms-of-trade theory predicts. Bagwell and Staiger also present regression results based on the relationship in (3.4), both for their partial equilibrium model with general demands and supplies and for the special case of that model in which demands and supplies are linear. Recall that in deriving (3.3) and (3.4) I assumed that if the home government were to cut its tari\u00a4 from its reaction-curve level to its politically optimal level the for- eign government would respond with a tari\u00a4 cut that was calibrated to hold the equilibrium world price epwconstant. To derive relationships that form the basis of their estimated regressions, Bagwell and Staiger relax this assumption and allow for more general tari\u00a4 responses from trading partners (or no response at all). As they demonstrate, this in\u0087 uences the interpretation of some of the estimated coe\u00a2 cients in their regressions, but does not change the essential predictions of the terms-of-trade theory with regard to the pattern of tari\u00a4 liberalization that should be observed: if WTO negotiations implement the e\u00a2 cient political opti- mum, then controlling for the level of the pre-negotiation tari\u00a4 BR gc, the tari\u00a4 level on imports of good gto which the government of country cagrees in a WTO negotiation should be lower the larger is the magnitude of the pre-negotiation normalized import volumeMBR gc epwBRg(in the case of linear demands and supplies) or more generally the larger is ad valorem tari\u00a4 level bound by acceding country con HS six- digit product gin its GATT/WTO negotiation and \u000fgcand gcare error terms, Bagwell and Staiger and^ 2<0, as the terms-of-trade theory predicts. 62I noted earlier that a limitation of the Bagwell and Staiger (2011) paper is that, in focusing on non-GATT-member countries who joined the WTO in accession negotiations after the Uruguay Round was completed, the paper excludes from the evaluation of GATT/WTO tari\u00a4 liberalization the major industrialized countries, who were all original or early GATT members and who historically have been the dominant actors in GATT/WTO tari\u00a4 negotiations. This limitation is addressed by Ludema and Mayda (2013), who extend the search for tari\u00a4bargaining evidence consistent with the terms-of-trade theory to a broader and more representative cross section of the GATT/WTO membership. To develop the prediction that they take to the data, Ludema and Mayda (2013) work within a partial equilibrium perfectly competitive many-good many- country model along the lines employed by Bagwell and Staiger (2011). In this model, as I have observed above, the purpose of a trade agreement is to eliminate the implications of market power from the unilateral tari\u00a4 choices that govern- ments would otherwise make. But while Bagwell and Staiger assess the extent to which the observed tari\u00a4 cuts in WTO accession negotiations conform to the tari\u00a4 cuts that would implement the political optimum and hence can be under- stood from the perspective of the terms-of-trade theory as allowing governments to reach the e\u00a2 ciency frontier, Ludema and Mayda assess the extent to which free-riding by non-participants in the negotiations and the consequent failure of GATT/WTO tari\u00a4 bargaining to reach the e\u00a2 ciency frontier can be understood from the perspective of the terms-of-trade theory. In particular, to capture key features of the GATT/WTO tari\u00a4 bargaining process, Ludema and Mayda (2013) posit an extensive form tari\u00a4 negotiation game in which countries negotiate bilaterally over MFN tari\u00a4s and participation is endogenous.32They exploit the fact that, when importing country ccuts an MFN tari\u00a4 on product g, all exporting countries facing that tari\u00a4 enjoy the same terms- of-trade improvement, @epgw=@ gc, the magnitude of which depends on country c\u0092 s market power. But recall that in this partial equilibrium setting the magnitude of the (negative) income e\u00a4ect of a small deterioration in country c\u0092 s terms of trade for goodg, holding xed its local price of good g, is given simply by the volume of its imports of good g,Wc pwg=\u0000Mgc(pgc( gc;epw g)); and the \u0087 ip side is that the (positive) income e\u00a4ect of the implied terms-of-trade improvement that is enjoyed by each exporting country c\u0003varies in proportion to its share of countryc\u0092 s total 32I discuss the tari\u00a4 negotiation game posited by Ludema and Mayda (2013) again at various points in chapters 4 and 5, when I compare their approach to modeling GATT tari\u00a4 negotiations with the approaches adopted by Bagwell, share of countryc\u0092 s imports of good gthat is supplied by exporting country c\u0003. Ludema and Mayda (2013) show that in the model of MFN tari\u00a4 bargaining with endogenous participation that they propose, if ine\u00a2 ciency occurs in equilib- rium in the negotiation over gc, it occurs because exporters of good gto country cbelow a critical export-share threshold \u0096 who by the above logic have less to gain from a reduction in gc\u0096choose not to participate in the negotiation with countrycover gc, and choose instead to free ride on the MFN tari\u00a4 cut that countrycagrees to in its negotiation over gcwith the exporters of good gto countrycabove the critical export-share threshold who, having the most to gain from a reduction in gc, choose to participate in the negotiations. And Ludema and Mayda show that an implication of this nding is that where exporters of a goodginto country care less concentrated as measured by the Her ndahl index, free-riding in GATT/WTO tari\u00a4 negotiations will be more of a problem, and the negotiated level of gcwill continue to bear more of the imprint of country c\u0092 s market power than in the case where exporters are highly concentrated. It is this relationship between exporter concentration and the degree to which negotiated tari\u00a4 levels continue to re\u0087 ect importer market power, derived by Ludema and Mayda (2013) in a setting that appends a particular model of tar- i\u00a4 bargaining to an underlying model conforming to the terms-of-trade theory of trade agreements, that Ludema and Mayda take to the data. Focusing on 36 GATT members that include all of the major industrialized countries as well as a number of developing and emerging economies, they nd that as a result of the free-rider e\u00a4ects created by MFN, between one tenth and one quarter of the tari\u00a4 liberalization that would have been required in the Uruguay Round to completely eliminate the imprint of market power from these tari\u00a4 schedules and bring these countries all the way to the e\u00a2 ciency frontier did not occur. As I noted above, Ludema and Mayda therefore provide an important quanti cation of the failure of GATT/WTO tari\u00a4 bargaining to reach the e\u00a2 ciency frontier as a result of the MFN free-rider e\u00a4ect in the Uruguay Round. But along the way they also pro- vide strong con rmation of the predictions of the terms-of-trade theory itself for a wide cross-section of the GATT/WTO membership, concluding that the terms- of-trade-manipulation motive drives unilateral tari\u00a4 choices and that GATT tari\u00a4 negotiating rounds were intended to neutralize this motive. Like Ludema and Mayda (2013), other recent papers have also found evidence consistent with the predictions of the terms-of-trade theory in the negotiated tari\u00a4 outcomes of a wide cross-section of the GATT/WTO membership. For example, 64Nicita, Olarreaga and Silva (2014) focus on the nature of the tari\u00a4 commitments made by WTO member countries \u0096commitments that as I have noted take the form of bindings de ning the maximum allowable level for the tari\u00a4 \u0096and exploit the fact that countries di\u00a4er in the degree to which their negotiated WTO tari\u00a4 commitments constrain their applied tari\u00a4s (i.e., the tari\u00a4levels that they actually set). Developing a prediction of the terms-of-trade theory that relates both the tari\u00a4s that are applied at the level of the binding and those that are applied below the binding to measures of a country\u0092 s market power, and examining the tari\u00a4s of101WTO member countries, Nicita, Olarreaga and Silva nd evidence broadly consistent with this prediction.33Beshkar and Bond (2017) similarly use the terms-of-trade theory to develop a relationship between the market power that a country wields on the one hand, and on the other hand the levels at which it binds its tari\u00a4s in GATT/WTO negotiations and the tari\u00a4s that it actually applies \u0096in this case exploiting the fact that, as described in chapter 2, a country can under certain conditions escape from its tari\u00a4 bindings and set applied tari\u00a4s above the binding \u0096and nd support for the relationship predicted by the terms-of-trade theory in this regard in the tari\u00a4s of 109WTO members.34 Together these papers provide reinforcing evidence that the observed pattern of negotiated tari\u00a4 cuts in the GATT/WTO correlates with the pattern of observed market power in the way that the terms-of-trade theory suggests that it should. 4. Tari\u00a4 Bargaining in the GATT/WTO In chapter 3 I presented evidence that countries use GATT negotiations to help them remove the imprint of market power from their unilateral tari\u00a4 choices. In this chapter I move on to the next logical question: How well-designed is GATT to help its member governments achieve this purpose? A unique feature of the GATT/WTO is that detailed bargaining records for many of its negotiation rounds are available to researchers and can be used to help answer this question. With these bargaining records, it is possible to probe beyond the outcomes of 33See also Beshkar, Bond and Rho (2015) for related ndings that focus on the relationship predicted by the terms-of-trade theory between market power and the di\u00a4erence between the bound and applied level of the tari\u00a4 (\u0093tari\u00a4 overhang\u0094 ) and nd empirical support for this relationship in tari\u00a4 data for 108WTO member countries. 34See also Bown and Crowley (2013) who, using data on the anti-dumping and safeguard ac- tions of the US over the period 1997-2006, nd empirical support for predictions of the terms-of- trade theory when that theory is developed in a repeated-tari\u00a4-game setting subject to stochastic trade volume shocks and where self-enforcement constraints are binding. 65GATT/WTO negotiations and examine the bargaining behavior that led to those outcomes. In this chapter I describe research that makes use of these records.35 Each GATT/WTO round proceeds under a speci c tari\u00a4 bargaining protocol. The rst ve GATT rounds involved selective product-by-product MFN tari\u00a4 negotiations on a bilateral \u0093request-o\u00a4er\u0094basis \u0096each government requests tari\u00a4 cuts from its bargaining partner in the bilateral and o\u00a4ers the tari\u00a4 cuts that it is prepared to make in the bilateral if its requests are granted \u0096and this was also true to varying degrees of the eighth (Uruguay) round and the currently suspended WTO (Doha) round.36Principal supplier status shapes the bargaining pairs that form in a round, and a double coincidence of wants must exist between any viable pair of bargaining partners: each country in the bargaining pair must be a principal supplier of at least one good to the other country in the pair, so that each has something of value to o\u00a4er the other. In essence, GATT\u0092 s reliance on the principal supplier rule has the e\u00a4ect of reducing the number of viable bilateral bargains in the round to a manageable level while at the same time allowing countries to focus on those bilaterals where the mutual stakes of the bargaining parties are likely to be highest. The object of negotiation is the tari\u00a4 binding, the legal maximum level above which a country agrees not to raise its tari\u00a4. As Hoda (2001, pp. 44-45) explains, the protocols for the rst ve rounds were similar: Each round began with the adoption of a decision convening a tari\u00a4 conference on a xed future date. The decision required the contracting parties to exchange request lists and furnish the latest edition of their cus- toms tari\u00a4s and their foreign trade statistics for a recent period well in advance of the rst day of the conference and the o\u00a4ers had to be made on the rst day. The negotiations were concluded generally over a period of six to seven months after the o\u00a4ers had been made...These negotiations were essentially bilateral between pairs of delegations. Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu (2020a) is the rst paper to analyze the GATT bargaining records. They focus on the Torquay Round (1950-51) of GATT negoti- ations, identify stylized facts from this round that emerge from an analysis of the 35The GATT bargaining records for the rst seven of the eight GATT rounds are available in PDF form at https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/gattbilaterals_e/indexbyround_e.htm. 36The sixth (Kennedy) and seventh (Tokyo) rounds of GATT negotiations took a linear-cut and formula-cut approach to tari\u00a4 negotiations, respectively, but even in these rounds bilateral product-by-product negotiations played an important complementary role. As Hoda (2001, p. 47) notes, \u0093... a linear or formula approach did not obviate the need for bilateral negotiations: they only gave the participants an additional tool to employ in the bargaining process.\u0094 66bargaining data, and suggest that these stylized facts re\u0087 ect a pragmatic approach to tari\u00a4 bargaining that was induced by the pillars of the GATT architecture and the bargaining forum that these pillars helped to create. I begin this chapter by describing how, through the lens of the terms-of-trade theory, the GATT pillars of reciprocity and MFN can simplify the tari\u00a4 bargaining problem, but at a po- tential cost, and thereby can be seen to facilitate a pragmatic approach to tari\u00a4 bargaining. I then describe the ndings of Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu. 4.1. Theory As I noted in chapter 2, MFN and reciprocity are two pillars of the GATT archi- tecture. Do these pillars create a bargaining forum that is well-designed to address the terms-of-trade manipulation problem? To provide an answer to this question from the perspective of the terms-of-trade theory, I rst return to the two-country model presented in chapter 2 and focus on the implications of GATT\u0092 s reciprocity rules and norms in that setting. I then consider MFN in a multicountry exten- sion of this model, and I describe how MFN and reciprocity work in tandem to shape the tari\u00a4 bargaining forum within which GATT/WTO members negotiate. Throughout I keep technical details to a minimum, and refer interested readers to Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu (2020a) for more detail and to Bagwell and Staiger (1999, 2002, 2005, 2010b, 2018a) where these theoretical ndings were originally derived and presented. Recall from chapter 2 that the GATT/WTO principle of reciprocity refers to the ideal of mutual changes in trade policy which bring about changes in the volume of each country\u0092 s imports that are equal in magnitude to the changes in the volume of its exports. As I noted there, there are two instances in GATT where this principle is applied: governments seek reciprocity through a \u0093balance of concessions\u0094in their GATT Article XXVIII bis negotiations to liberalize tari\u00a4s; and when one government reverses its negotiated tari\u00a4 liberalization, perhaps in a formal GATT Article XXVIII renegotiation but more generally whether it does so de facto or de jure, its trading partners are permitted to maintain reciprocity through retaliation by withdrawing \u0093substantially equivalent concessions\u0094of their own. Hence, the rst instance of reciprocity applies when tari\u00a4s are moving in the downward direction, while the second applies when tari\u00a4s are moving in the up- ward direction. The rst instance is a negotiating norm rather than a requirement that must be satis ed by negotiated tari\u00a4 movements in the downward direction, but it is a norm that was strongly embedded in the culture of GATT (see, for 67example, Curzon, 1966, p. 74). The second instance is a rule that speci es the maximum permissible retaliatory response and therefore is a requirement that governs the movements of previously negotiated and bound tari\u00a4s in the upward direction. In what follows I describe the implications that arise according to the terms-of-trade theory from a strict application of reciprocity in both directions. I begin by de ning reciprocity within the model of chapter 2, following Bagwell and Staiger (1999).37Consider a tari\u00a4 negotiation that, starting from an initial pair of tari\u00a4s, ( 0; \u00030), results Denoting prices as \u00031)andp1\u0011p( 1;epw1), I will say that the tari\u00a4 changes conform to the principle of reciprocity when epw0[Mx(p1;epw1)\u0000Mx(p0;epw0)] = [Ey(p1;epw1)\u0000Ey(p0;epw0)]; (4.1) where changes in trade volumes are valued at the existing world price. The key point is to notice that, by using the home-country balanced trade condition recorded in (2.1), the reciprocity condition in (4.1) may be rewritten as [epw1\u0000epw0]Mx(p1;epw1) = 0; (4.2) which implies epw1=epw0provided only that Mx(p1;epw1)>0. An analogous de- nition of reciprocity holds from the perspective of the foreign country, with an analogous implication. According to (4.2), reciprocity can therefore be given a simple characterization in the two-country two-good model of chapter 2: mutual changes in trade policy conform to the principle of reciprocity if and only if they leaveepw\u0096the terms of trade between the home and foreign country \u0096unchanged.38 With this characterization in hand, I next consider how strict adherence to reci- procity simpli es the tari\u00a4 bargaining problem in this two-country setting. 37The concept of reciprocity has a long history in many literatures but, when used, has not always been unambiguously de ned, and as Keohane (1986) notes this has often led to confusion. The de nition of reciprocity that I adopt here, which follows Bagwell and Staiger (1999), formalizes the notion of \u0093substantially equivalent concessions\u0094that is at the heart of the GATT/WTO concept of reciprocity. 38Bagwell and Staiger (1999, note 16) extends this result to a many-good version of the model of chapter 2, while Bagwell and Staiger (2016, Online Appendix) provides a generalization of a number of additional features of reciprocity to the many-good general-equilibrium setting. These properties of reciprocity are also shown to hold in a two-sector partial equilibrium setting where the non-numeraire sector is a monopolistically competitive industry with many varieties (see Bagwell and Staiger, 2015) or a homogeneous-good industry with a monopoly or (Cournot) oligopoly structure (see Bagwell and Staiger, 2012a), and in a three-good partial equilibrium setting where each of the two non-numeraire goods is a competitive homogeneous-good industry 68Consider rst the implication when governments adhere strictly to reciprocity in the downward direction. With reciprocity xing the balance of market access concessions to be exchanged at one-for-one and therefore xing the terms of trade atepw0according to (4.2), the two governments are only bargaining over the depth of the reciprocal tari\u00a4 cuts to which they will agree. The depth of these cuts de- termines the home tari\u00a4 1, and hence the home local price according to p( 1;epw0) and its import volume according to Mx(p( 1;epw0);epw0); and it determines the for- eign tari\u00a4 \u00031, and hence the foreign local price according to p\u0003( \u00031;epw0)and its import volume according to M\u0003 y(p\u0003( \u00031;epw0);epw0). This means that the preferred depth of the reciprocal tari\u00a4 cuts for the home government would deliver the home tari\u00a4 level ^ 1de ned byWp(p(^ 1;epw0);epw0) = 0, and the home government would propose that the foreign government reciprocate with the =epw0that likewise, the preferred depth of the reciprocal tari\u00a4 cuts for the foreign government would deliver the foreign tari\u00a4 level ^ \u00031de ned byW\u0003 p\u0003(p\u0003(^ \u00031;epw0);epw0) = 0, and the foreign government would propose that the home government reciprocate with the =epw0that leavesepwunchanged. If the two governments agree on the preferred depth of reciprocal tari\u00a4 cuts in the sense that ^ 1= R(^ \u00031)and^ \u00031= \u0003R(^ 1), then their preferred proposals will agree, and there will be no haggling: by holding themselves strictly to the GATT norm of reciprocity in the downward direction and thereby eliminating strategic considerations over the implications of their agreed tari\u00a4s for the terms of trade, governments succeed in eliminating strategic considerations completely from their tari\u00a4bargaining. And in this case, the agreed tari\u00a4s satisfy Wp(p(^ 1;epw0);epw0) = 0 andW\u0003 p\u0003(p\u0003(^ \u00031;epw0);epw0) = 0, implying that governments implement the political optimum point on the e\u00a2 ciency frontier. On the other hand, if the two governments disagree over the preferred depth of reciprocal tari\u00a4 cuts in the sense that ^ 16= R(^ \u00031)and^ \u000316= \u0003R(^ 1), with one government wanting deeper reciprocal tari\u00a4 cuts than the other government, then their preferred proposals will disagree. It is in this case that the application of reciprocity in the upward direction becomes important: in e\u00a4ect, due to this (see Bagwell and Staiger, 2001a). Notice too that, by xing relative exporter prices (the terms of trade), reciprocity also ensures that any changes in the tari\u00a4 revenue collected by one country from the exporters of its trading partner must be matched by changes in the tari\u00a4 revenue that its trading partner collects from its exporters (see Bagwell and Staiger, 1999, note 16); this con rms the equivalence between reciprocity and the matching of changes in tari\u00a4 revenue collected by each country from the exporters of its trading partner that I asserted in the intuitive discussion of chapter 1. 69second application of reciprocity, strategic considerations will still be absent from the negotiations and there will still be no haggling; and the government wanting thelessambitious agreement will get its way. This is because if this government were pushed in the negotiations to liberalize its tari\u00a4below the level that it prefers, it could always \u0096subsequent to the negotiations \u0096unilaterally raise its tari\u00a4 back up to this level, and the most that the other government would be allowed to do under this second application of reciprocity is to retaliate with a tari\u00a4 hike of its own that keeps the terms of trade at the level epw0, thereby allowing the rst government to achieve its preferred tari\u00a4 after all; and knowing this, the two governments are aware when they make their initial tari\u00a4 proposals that the government wanting the less ambitious agreement will ultimately get its way.39 In a tari\u00a4 bargaining model meant to capture the two applications of reci- procity in GATT, Bagwell and Staiger (1999) capture this implication of reci- procity in the upward direction in a short-hand way, by assuming that when the two governments make tari\u00a4 proposals that disagree, the proposal with the high- est tari\u00a4 pair and implying the lowest trade volume is ultimately implemented. They show that, even in the case where the two governments disagree over the preferred depth of reciprocal tari\u00a4 cuts, it will still be the case that allstrate- gic considerations in tari\u00a4 bargaining are eliminated if the governments abide by strict reciprocity in the two instances where reciprocity arises in GATT. Intu- itively, reciprocity in the downward direction xes the \u0093price\u0094 at which market access is to be exchanged between the two governments; and reciprocity in the upward direction then amounts to an assurance of \u0093voluntary exchange\u0094whereby no government can be forced as a result of the negotiations to accept more trade volume than it desires at this price, determining the depth of the tari\u00a4 cuts to which the two governments will agree.40At this point, there is no room left in the negotiations for strategic behavior. More formally, as Bagwell and Staiger (1999) demonstrate in their model of tari\u00a4 bargaining, in the two-country model presented in chapter 2 it is a dom- inant strategy for the home government to propose the tari\u00a4 pair (^ 1; \u0003R(^ 1)) and for the foreign government to propose the tari\u00a4 pair (^ \u00031; R(^ \u00031)), and the 39This point is related to Tasca\u0092 s (1938, p. 146) discussion, from which I quote in chapter 2, of the importance of various \u0093withdrawal clauses\u0094in the RTAA. 40The \u0093voluntary exchange\u0094 aspect induced by reciprocity in the upward direction and its impact on the bargaining outcome as modeled in Bagwell and Staiger (1999) echoes the logic of reciprocity described by Dam (1970) in the passage I quoted from in chapter 2, that governments understood that \u0093[t]he best guarantee that a commitment of any kind will be kept ... is that the parties continue to view adherence to their agreement as in their mutual interest ... .\u0094 70implemented tari\u00a4 pair is then determined by the least ambitious tari\u00a4 proposal (i.e., the proposal that implies the smallest amount of reciprocal liberalization). Notice that, unless the proposals happen to agree and the political optimum is implemented, only one of the two governments will achieve its preferred tari\u00a4 and hence preferred local price and import volume, and it is easily checked that in this case the condition for e\u00a2 ciency in (2.15) will be violated at the agreed tari\u00a4s. Therefore, according to the terms-of-trade theory of trade agreements, as a general matter strict adherence to GATT\u0092 s reciprocity rules will introduce a trade- o\u00a4. On the one hand, strict adherence to these rules can eliminate strategic considerations from bargaining, and can in this way help governments avoid the attendant bargaining costs (e.g., in the form of bargaining delay) that they might otherwise incur. On the other hand, the constraints that reciprocity imposes on the possible tari\u00a4 bargaining outcomes may prevent the two governments from ever reaching the e\u00a2 ciency frontier. If we think of the initial tari\u00a4 pair from which negotiations begin as corre- sponding to the Nash tari\u00a4s de ned by the joint solution to (2.10) and (2.11), then this trade-o\u00a4 becomes less favorable the greater are the asymmetries in market power that are wielded by the two governments. This is because such asymmetries translate into an initial terms of trade, epw0\u0011epw( N; \u0003N), which is then further away from the terms of trade epw( PO; \u0003PO)necessary to imple- ment a point on the e\u00a2 ciency frontier in this bargaining game (i.e., the polit- ical optimum). It is only in the special case where the distribution of market power wielded by governments happens to be symmetric across countries so that epw0\u0011epw( N; \u0003N) =epw( PO; \u0003PO)that the reached under strict adherence to GATT\u0092 s reciprocity rules and the trade-o\u00a4 vanishes. Viewed through the lens of the terms-of-trade theory, the applications of reciprocity found in the GATT/WTO can thus be seen as facilitating a pragmatic approach to tar- i\u00a4 bargaining in an environment where bargaining frictions might otherwise be substantial, and one that is most likely to lead to good tari\u00a4 bargaining outcomes when the world does not exhibit large asymmetries along the relevant dimensions. It is interesting to note that the absence of strategic bargaining behavior is seen by GATT practitioners and legal scholars as a hallmark of the tari\u00a4 bargain- ing that occurred in the early GATT rounds and as distinguishing GATT tari\u00a4 bargaining from the tari\u00a4 bargaining that preceded it. Describing the bargaining techniques in use during the rst ve GATT rounds of request-o\u00a4er tari\u00a4 nego- tiations, Curzon (1966, p. 74) emphasizes the role of reciprocity in dictating the balance that each country struck between its requests for and o\u00a4ers of market 71access, and the lack of strategic behavior that this balance induced: ... Their requests cannot be higher than their o\u00a4ers and negotiations start from this maximum position: if all requests are granted all the o\u00a4ers will be ful lled. Similarly all other contracting parties are likely to make o\u00a4ers which match the requests they have made. As some of the requests are rejected, some of the o\u00a4ers are withdrawn. This procedure has been raised to a Gatt principle and is not laid down by any rule. It is a convention but one which creates a much better negotiating climate than the opposite trend which was a feature of the classical bilateral negotiations. Then, everyone put forward very low o\u00a4ers with the intention of increasing gradually if the bargaining proved pro table. A country never knew, however, when it had reached the maximum its partner was willing to concede. Curzon further clari es this feature in his description of the behavior of GATT newcomers that tried unsuccessfully to pursue classical bargaining strategies: Several newcomers to GATT unaware of this new technique and starting with low o\u00a4ers found that in the course of negotiations they were unable to reach the level of requests they aimed for. Their initially low o\u00a4ers were taken as proof of their intentions and they either had to go home with a tari\u00a4 higher than expected or had to increase their o\u00a4ers in the course of the negotiations. (Curzon, 1966, p. 74) Here Curzon describes a tari\u00a4 bargaining forum in which there is no point in making lowball initial o\u00a4ers, because governments expect non-strategic behavior from their bargaining partners and such o\u00a4ers would be taken at face value. I next consider the role played by MFN in a multicountry extension of the two-country model, and I describe how MFN and reciprocity can in principle work together to simplify the multilateral tari\u00a4 bargaining problem. To this end I consider an extension of the model to three countries, where the home country now exports good yto two foreign countries, \u0091 \u00031\u0092and \u0091\u00032,\u0092and imports good x from each of them (the two foreign countries do not trade with each other). Each foreign country can impose a tari\u00a4 \u0003ifori2f1;2gon its imports of good yfrom the home country, and the home country can set tari\u00a4s on its imports of good x from the two foreign countries. If the home country were to apply the discriminatory tari\u00a4s 1to imports from foreign-country 1and 26= 1to imports from foreign-country 2, then separate 72world prices would apply to its trade with each partner, pw1for its trade with foreign-country 1andpw2for its trade with foreign-country 2. This follows because there is a single local price pin the home economy, and the pricing relationships p= (1 + 1)pw1andp= (1 + 2)pw2then imply pw16=pw2whenever 16= 2. The MFN rule imposes the non-discrimination requirement 1= 2\u0011 . A rst and immediate implication of the MFN rule can now be appreciated: under MFN, a single equilibrium world price, epw( ; \u00031; \u00032), must prevail, as I noted in previous chapters. This is important, because it means that when the MFN rule applies the representation of government preferences introduced in the two- country model of chapter 2 extends without quali cation to the three-country setting, with these with the two-country model I assume that the functionepwas de ned here is decreasing in and increasing in \u00031and \u00032. And with government preferences of this form, it is straightforward to show that the political optimum de ned by the three tari\u00a4s that satisfy the three conditions Wp(p;epw) = 0,W\u00031 p\u00031(p\u00031;epw) = 0 andW\u00032 p\u00032(p\u00032;epw) = 0 continues to be e\u00a2 cient. Evidently, in a multilateral world the MFN principle ensures that the interna- tional externality at the root of the problem to be solved by a trade agreement is still the same terms-of-trade externality driven by movements in epwthat arises in the simpler two-country setting. Notice, though, that according to the equilib- rium world price function epw( ; \u00031; \u00032)each country\u0092 s welfare will be impacted by the tari\u00a4 choices of the remaining two countries if these tari\u00a4 choices impact the world price. This implies in turn that in a multilateral world, bilateral MFN tari\u00a4 bargains will in general impose terms-of-trade externalities on third coun- tries, indicating a potentially important multilateral dimension associated with such bargains that further complicates the bargaining problem.41This is where reciprocity, now in combination with MFN, can again simplify things. To see the simpli cation that is a\u00a4orded when MFN is combined with reci- procity in this setting, consider a tari\u00a4 bargain between the home country and foreign-country 1, and suppose for the moment that foreign-country 2refuses to join the negotiations and keeps its tari\u00a4 held xed at the level \u00032 0. How will foreign-country 2be impacted by the bilateral tari\u00a4 bargain between the home country and foreign-country 1? When the home country lowers its MFN tari\u00a4 41In the absence of MFN, there would also be multilateral dimensions associated with any bilateral (discriminatory) tari\u00a4 bargain, but the nature of the spillovers would be di\u00a4erent (see Bagwell and Staiger, 2005, and Staiger improvement, because foreign-country 2\u0092 s exporters enjoy a higher price for their exports of xinto the home-country market, and because foreign- country 2also pays a lower price for imports of yfrom the home country owing to the stimulus to home-country export supply of ythat is created by the home- country\u0092 s tari\u00a4 cut. On the other hand, when foreign-country 2\u0092 s exporters receive a lower price for their exports of xinto the home-country market owing to the increased competition that they face from the stimulated export supply of xcoming from foreign-country 1as a result of foreign-country 1\u0092 s tari\u00a4 cut, and because foreign- country 2also pays a higher price for imports of yfrom the home country owing to foreign-country 1\u0092 s increased demand for imports of yfrom the home country as a result of foreign-country 1\u0092 s tari\u00a4 cut. Hence, when the home country and foreign-country 1bothlower their tari\u00a4s as part of a bilateral tari\u00a4 negotiation, the sign of the impact on epw( ; \u00031; \u00032 0)and therefore on foreign-country 2is in general ambiguous , and depends on the relative size of the home and foreign-country- 1tari\u00a4 cuts. And it is straightforward to show that the cuts in and \u00031that exactly balance these opposing forces and leave epw( ; \u00031; \u00032 0)unchanged are precisely the tari\u00a4 cuts that conform to reciprocity as I have de ned reciprocity in (4.1) above. But now recall that foreign-country 2has by assumption kept its tari\u00a4 held xed at the level \u00032 0. So ifepw( ; \u00031; \u00032 0) is held xed by the reciprocal tari\u00a4 cuts that the home country and foreign- country 1negotiate, it follows that p\u00032( \u00032 0;epw( ; \u00031; \u00032 0))is then also held xed, and therefore neither will be impacted by the bilateral tari\u00a4 negotiation between the home country and foreign-country 1: there will be no third-party spillovers to foreign-country 2from the bargain. Evidently, under the GATT pillars of MFN and reciprocity, if foreign-country 2 refuses to bargain it will get nothing; and the bargain between the home country and foreign-country 1can proceed without strategic considerations, exactly as in the two-country setting discussed above. These and related points are developed more fully in Bagwell and Staiger (2005, 2010b).42 42I have described this result in a simple 2-good model. See Bagwell and Staiger (2002, Appendix B) for a discussion of this result in the many-good setting. See also Ossa (2014) and the discussion of Ossa in Bagwell and Staiger (2016, p 512-513) for a quali cation to this result that arises in a monopolistic competition setting. The modeling framework considered by 74Now suppose that foreign-country 2decides to join the negotiations. In this case it is easy to see how the home country could engage in a sequence of bilateral bargains, rst with foreign-country 1, and then with foreign-country 2, where each bargain abides by MFN and reciprocity and where there are then no strategic considerations and no third-party spillovers associated with either bilateral. If the home-country negotiations with foreign-country 1do not exhaust the home- country\u0092 s desire for reciprocal tari\u00a4 cuts, it could then continue to engage in further reciprocal tari\u00a4 liberalization with foreign-country 2. The process I have just described looks much like the \u0093split concessions\u0094tech- nique for preserving bargaining power as described by Beckett (1941, p. 23) in the context of the RTAA and discussed in chapter 2, whereby \u0093a small reduction in duty is made in the agreement with the rst country and an additional reduction in the agreement with the second country,\u0094all the while achieving reciprocity in each bilateral and maintaining MFN.43But a key di\u00a4erence between the RTAA and GATT is that in a GATT round these bilateral negotiations occur simulta- neously rather than sequentially. It was thought that this would speed up the bilateral negotiating process in GATT relative to the RTAA, and that it would allow the properties of MFN and bilateral reciprocity described just above to be extended to multilateral reciprocity, relaxing the need for strict bilateral balance between concessions granted and concessions obtained and allowing countries to focus instead on achieving the desired balance on a multilateral basis. As one early GATT report put it (see also Curzon, 1966, pp. 75-77): Multilateral tari\u00a4 bargaining, as devised at the London Session of the Preparatory Committee in October 1946 and as worked out in practice at Geneva and Annecy, is one of the most remarkable developments in economic relations between nations that has occurred in our time. It has produced a technique whereby governments, in determining the concessions they are prepared to o\u00a4er, are able to take into account the indirect bene ts Ludema and Mayda (2013) that I discussed in chapter 3 does not allow for the possibility that tari\u00a4 cuts in a bilateral could be balanced in such a way as to reduce or eliminate movements in world prices and thereby reduce or eliminate third-party spillovers, because that framework is partial equilibrium (and abstracts from export taxes; see Bagwell and Staiger, 2001a for an analysis of reciprocity that establishes that its key properties are preserved in a partial equilibrium setting where both import taxes and export taxes are available). 43Bagwell and Staiger (2010b) investigate the properties of sequential tari\u00a4liberalization under MFN and reciprocity, and relate their results to the entry of new and economically signi cant countries into the world trading system. I will return to this paper in chapter 7, when I discuss the \u0093latecomers problem\u0094that the WTO\u0092 s Doha Round may be grappling with. 75they may expect to gain as a result of simultaneous negotiations between other countries, and whereby world tari\u00a4s may be scaled down within a remarkably short time. ... The multilateral character of the Agreement en- abled the negotiators to o\u00a4er more extensive concessions than they might have been prepared to grant if the concessions were to be incorporated in separate bilateral agreements. Before the Geneva negotiations a country would have aimed at striking a balance between the concessions granted to another country and the direct concessions obtained from it without taking into account indirect bene ts which might accrue from other prospective trade agreements; it might even have been unwilling to grant an important concession if it had been obliged to extend that concession to third countries without compensation. (ICITO, 1949, p. 10) In e\u00a4ect, the ICITO report observed that GATT rounds made it possible for gov- ernments to exchange in a balanced way the spillovers across bilaterals that might arise from a lack of bilateral reciprocity, and thereby still achieve overall, multi- lateral, reciprocity; and that this feature enabled a more extensive agreement. To see how the implications of MFN and bilateral reciprocity described above extend also to multilateral reciprocity, it is helpful to consider a four-country setting, where the home country now trades with three foreign countries indexed byi2 f1;2;3g, and where the equilibrium world price function is now given byepw( ; \u00031; \u00032; \u00033)withepwdecreasing in and increasing in \u00033. To x ideas, suppose that foreign-country 3refuses to join the negotiations and keeps its tari\u00a4 held xed at the level \u00033 0. And suppose that the home country negotiates bilaterally and also now simultaneously with foreign countries 1and2in a negotiating \u0093round.\u0094And nally suppose for simplicity that the home country\u0092 s desire for reciprocal tari\u00a4 cuts is at least as great as the sum of the desire for such tari\u00a4 cuts from foreign countries 1and2. Consider rst the possibility that the bilateral MFN negotiations proceed along the lines of bilateral reciprocity described above. In its bilateral with foreign- country 1, the home country could o\u00a4er to cut its MFN tari\u00a4 in exchange for a reciprocal tari\u00a4 cut from foreign-country 1to the level that foreign-country 1 prefers, ^ \u00031, implying the home 0 implying the exchange of reciprocal tari\u00a4 cuts \u0001 \u00031 0in this bilateral. the home country could engage in further 76reciprocal tari\u00a4cuts with foreign-country 2, o\u00a4ering a further tari\u00a4cut in exchange for a reciprocal tari\u00a4 cut from foreign-country 2to the level that foreign-country 2prefers, (4.3) 0in this bilateral. Under this rst possibility, the home country negotiates two tari\u00a4 bindings, one with foreign-country 1and a second, lower one, with foreign-country 2; and when these two bilaterals occur simultaneously, it is the lower binding which summarizes the implications of the round for the \u0093applied\u0094 home-country tari\u00a4 that enters the world price function in (4.3). With these agreed tari\u00a4 changes satisfying reciprocity in each bilateral, the overall changes in tari\u00a4s negotiated in the round as a result of the two bilaterals will of course by construction satisfy reciprocity as well, and will therefore leave the terms of trade unaltered, as is re\u0087 ected in (4.3). Hence, as I described above in the context of the three-country model, in the four-country setting it is also true that when each of the bilateral MFN negotiations adheres to reciprocity, there are no strategic considerations and no third-party spillovers from the bilaterals, and in this case the non-participating foreign-country 3receives nothing. But now consider an alternative possibility for the outcomes of each of the bilaterals. Suppose in its bilateral with foreign-country 1the home country fers the tari\u00a4 \u00031 0 from and suppose in its bilateral with foreign-country 2the home country demands \u00032\u0000 \u00032 0while o\u00a4ering nothing in return. Now reciprocity is violated in each bilateral, with the home country grant- ing greater-than-reciprocal tari\u00a4 cuts in its bilateral with foreign-country 1and receiving greater-than-reciprocal tari\u00a4 cuts in its bilateral with foreign-country 2. And as a result, viewed in isolation each bilateral would alter the terms of trade epw, with foreign-country 3enjoying a terms-of-trade improvement as a result of the tari\u00a4 cuts exchanged in home\u0092 s bilateral with foreign-country 1and su\u00a4ering a terms-of-trade deterioration as a result of the tari\u00a4 cuts exchanged in home\u0092 s bilateral with foreign-country 2. Nevertheless, this alternative possibility still de- livers the same overall outcome of the negotiating round, as embodied in the tari\u00a4s \u0016 ,^ \u00031and^ \u00032, with \u00033held xed at \u00033 0. And so, as (4.3) indicates, once the outcomes of the bilaterals are viewed in their totality, it is clear that the various violations of bilateral reciprocity that I have just described o\u00a4set each other, so thatmultilateral reciprocity is still maintained, the terms of trade is still preserved, 77and strategic considerations and third-party spillovers are still eliminated. It is in this general way, as the quoted passage from the ICITO report above suggests, that the innovation introduced by GATT rounds of simultaneous bilat- eral MFN tari\u00a4 bargains over the earlier sequential bilateral MFN tari\u00a4 bargains of the RTAA may have relaxed the constraint of bilateral reciprocity and allowed governments \u0096by \u0093exchanging\u0094 spillovers across bilaterals in a balanced way \u0096 to continue to enjoy the bene ts of MFN and reciprocity under the less stringent requirement of multilateral reciprocity.44 Bagwell and Staiger (2018a) provide the dominant-strategy arguments that formalize these insights in the context of the three-country model described above. In the tari\u00a4 bargaining game that they consider, the three countries take as given the initial tari\u00a4 vector and the accompanying world price, and then make simul- taneous tari\u00a4 proposals. Mimicking the request-o\u00a4er structure of GATT tari\u00a4 negotiations, a strategy for each country is a proposal for its own tari\u00a4 and that of its trading partner(s), where a proposal must satisfy MFN and multilateral reciprocity. Each country\u0092 s proposal, if accepted, would imply an import volume for itself. Bagwell and Staiger then construct a simple mechanism that takes the proposals made by the three countries and assigns a vector of tari\u00a4s. If the pro- posals agree, the tari\u00a4 vector comprised of each country\u0092 s own-tari\u00a4 proposal is assigned. If the proposals do not agree, the mechanism assigns a vector of tari\u00a4s that maximizes the trade volume subject to maintaining the initial world price (reciprocity in the downward direction) and subject to a \u0093voluntary exchange\u0094 constraint under which no country is forced to import a volume in excess of its implied import volume (reciprocity in the upward direction). When the proposals do not agree, with one side wanting deeper reciprocal tari\u00a4 cuts than the other, a \u0093rebalancing\u0094of o\u00a4ers is required, because the depth of the o\u00a4er(s) on the \u0093long\u0094 side of the market must be reduced to match the depth on the \u0093short\u0094 side. For the constructed mechanism, Bagwell and Staiger show that if countries use dominant strategies, each country\u0092 s proposal must specify a tari\u00a4 for itself that delivers its preferred local price and trade volume, given the initial world price; and under dominant-strategy proposals, the implemented tari\u00a4 vector is e\u00a2 cient if and only if the initial world price corresponds to the world price that would also prevail at the politically optimal tari\u00a4s, just as I described above in the context 44What is not answered here is what exactly the countries gain from the relaxation of the bilateral reciprocity constraint to a multilateral reciprocity constraint. But it is not hard to imagine trading patterns (e.g., such as featured in the triangular trade model of Maggi, 1999), where the relaxation of this constraint would make a di\u00a4erence to the bargaining outcomes. 78of reciprocity in the two-country setting. The upshot is that, when negotiations must satisfy MFN and multilateral reci- procity, a strategically complex multilateral bargaining problem is converted into a comparatively straightforward collection of bilateral bargains, because under MFN and multilateral reciprocity it is a dominant strategy for each participat- ing government to propose for a given import product the tari\u00a4 that generates its preferred local price and trade volume for the xed terms of trade. Hence, when governments adhere strictly to MFN and multilateral reciprocity in their GATT tari\u00a4 bargains, there should be an absence of strategic behavior among the participating governments. A further implication of Bagwell and Staiger\u0092 s (2018a) analysis is that, under MFN and multilateral reciprocity, a government anticipates that any subsequent rebalancing of o\u00a4ers necessary for multilateral reciprocity would arise later in the round after all o\u00a4ers had been recorded and that this might lead to a reduction in the depth of its overall (multilateral) o\u00a4er. This implies that there will be an important multilateral element to the bilateral bargains. And nally, at a more speci c level these features imply that, when tari\u00a4 bargaining takes place under the constraints of MFN and multilateral reci- procity, o\u00a4ers play a central role and are not often modi ed, lowball initial o\u00a4ers are absent, and linkages across bilaterals are present.45This summarizes the bar- gaining behavior that would be expected in a tari\u00a4 bargaining forum shaped by the requirements of MFN and multilateral reciprocity when viewed through the lens of the terms-of-trade theory. 4.2. Torquay Round bargaining records With the theoretical considerations developed above as a guide, I now describe the ndings of Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu (2020a) with regard to the bargaining records of the Torquay Round, which cover negotiations that spanned a 10month period over 1950\u000051. There were 37negotiating parties at Torquay, representing 39countries and accounting for well over 80percent of world trade as of 1949.46Of the666possible bargaining pairs, 298formed, re\u0087 ecting the bargaining structure by the principal supplier rule: Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu report that on average 1:25exporting countries bargained with an importing country over a 45Outcomes consistent with either zero or one modi cations to the initial o\u00a4er can arise under the mechanism characterized by Bagwell and Staiger (2018a). If shocks (e.g., a given bilateral randomly fails) were introduced, additional o\u00a4er modi cations could naturally arise. 46Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands belonged to the Benelux customs union which negotiated its common external tari\u00a4s as a single entity. 79given tari\u00a4, with the requirement of a double coincidence of wants then deter- mining the list of viable bilaterals. The GATT Torquay bargaining records cover 292of the 298bilaterals that were formed, 148of which were successfully com- pleted and led to agreed tari\u00a4 commitments on thousands of tari\u00a4-line products. The United States engaged in bilateral negotiations with 24of its 36potential negotiating partners, and reached nal agreement with 15of them. Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu document three stylized facts of the tari\u00a4 bar- gaining at Torquay that conform broadly to the predictions of the terms-of-trade theory outlined above. First, initial o\u00a4ers were not often modi ed in the negotia- tions. On products where a country made at least 1o\u00a4er in the bilateral, it made an average of 1:36o\u00a4ers in a bilateral on that product; and on products where a country made at least 1request in the bilateral, modi cation was even more rare, with an average of 1:02requests in a bilateral on that product. Moreover, o\u00a4ers played a central role in the bargaining, in that when proposals were modi ed, it was the o\u00a4ers, not the requests, that were adjusted: 82percent of the counterpro- posals made in a bilateral involved a modi cation of an own-tari\u00a4-cut o\u00a4er, not a modi cation of the request for a tari\u00a4 cut from the bargaining partner. In this sense, it appears that o\u00a4ers were taken at face value \u0096if my bargaining partner\u0092 s initial o\u00a4er did not meet my initial request, I reduced the depth of my o\u00a4er to match the depth of my partner\u0092 s o\u00a4er rather than request that my partner increase her o\u00a4er to match my initial request \u0096much as Curzon (1966, p. 74) suggests in the passage quoted above and as the terms-of-trade theory predicts. Second, there was a notable absence of initial lowball o\u00a4ers, with the initial o\u00a4ers cutting tari\u00a4s on average to 82:2percent of their existing levels and with the nal o\u00a4ers cutting tari\u00a4s to 80:9percent of their existing levels, corresponding to an average downward movement in o\u00a4ers made within a bilateral over the 10 months of negotiations that amounted to less than 2percent of the initial o\u00a4ers. Moreover, even this amount of downward movement hides an interesting fact: as Curzon (1966, p. 74) observed in the passage quoted above, the lack of lowball initial o\u00a4ers was particularly striking for countries that had previous negotiating experience in earlier GATT rounds. This is documented in Tables 4.1 and 4.2. Table 4.1, which is excerpted from Table A3 of the Online Appendix to Bag- well, Staiger and Yurukoglu (2020a), reports negotiating statistics for the subset of countries at Torquay that had also been present at the previous GATT (An- necy) round. Table 4.2, excerpted from Table A2 of the same Online Appendix, reports the same statistics for the six countries (Austria, Germany, Korea, Peru, Philippines and Turkey) that were negotiating their accession to GATT during 80the Torquay Round, and hence were GATT newcomers. \u0093Sales\u0094refer to requests of and o\u00a4ers on a country\u0092 s own tari\u00a4s, while \u0093Purchases\u0094 refer to requests of and o\u00a4ers on the tari\u00a4s of the country\u0092 s bargaining partner. Each table presents Country-Speci c numbers that refer to a given Seller-Purchaser-HS6.47 Table 4.1: GATT Oldtimers (Reproduced from Table A3 to Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu, 2020a) Table 4.2: GATT Newcomers (Reproduced Table A2 the Online Appendix to Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu, 2020a) As the Sales columns of Table 4.1 re\u0087 ect, when the focus is limited to ex- perienced GATT negotiators, on average the initial o\u00a4ers reduced tari\u00a4s to 80:8 percent of their existing levels and the nal o\u00a4ers reduced tari\u00a4s to 80:6percent of their existing levels, corresponding to an average downward movement in o\u00a4ers made within a bilateral for these countries that amounted to 0:2percent. By con- trast, for the GATT newcomers, the Sales columns of Table 4.2 reveals that the 47In their Online Appendix, Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu (2020a) also report Cross-Country numbers for a given Seller-HS6 across all its bargaining partners that re\u0087 ect similar patterns. 81analogous numbers were 85:5percent and 81:9percent, amounting to an average downward movement in o\u00a4ers made within a bilateral for the newcomer countries that amounted to 4:2percent. And a comparison of the Purchases columns across the two tables indicates that bargaining partners did not alter their behavior when confronted with the bargaining behavior of newcomers: on average the downward movement in the o\u00a4ers made to experienced and rst-time GATT negotiators was 0.015 percent and 0.013 percent, respectively. Third, there is evidence that multilateral linkages gave rise to issues of sequenc- ing across the bilaterals. Initial o\u00a4ers on the table would sometimes sit dormant for long periods of time, only to be nalized with a single modi cation at the time that other bargains were also being concluded. Speci cally, Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu report that for bilaterals that ended in a nal agreement, an average of11:8weeks passed between the last o\u00a4er or modi ed o\u00a4er made in the bilateral and the announcement of an agreement. And some agreements were themselves also modi ed at the conclusion of the round. Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu report that, for the average agreement, modi cations applied to 3:5percent of the total number of products on which initial agreement was reached.48 Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu also provide evidence that these multilateral linkages were driven by a desire of governments to maintain multilateral reci- procity in their bargains. They do this by exploiting the unexpected collapse of a number of bilaterals that occurred in the middle of the Torquay Round, where these bilaterals involved the United States on one side and the UK and several of its Commonwealth partners on the other side. As Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu observe, if third parties were counting on indirect trade bene ts from the MFN tari\u00a4 cuts negotiated in the US-UK/Commonwealth country bilaterals to help them achieve multilateral reciprocity in the Torquay Round, then there should have been an observable reaction in the bilateral bargaining records of these third countries and their bargaining partners when the US-UK/Commonwealth coun- try bilaterals unexpectedly collapsed, as these third countries would have sought to rebalance their outstanding o\u00a4ers in light of this development and re-establish multilateral reciprocity; whereas no such reaction would be expected if strictly bilateral reciprocity had been demanded and achieved by all countries all along. Analyzing the bargaining records, Bagwell, Staiger note, a feature of the Torquay Round bargaining data that is not accounted for by the theoretical framework I have outlined above is the fact that, when a country chose to reduce the depth of its o\u00a4ers, it did so by removing products from its o\u00a4ers, not by reducing the magnitude of the tari\u00a4 cut o\u00a4ered on a given product. 82sequent to the collapse of the US-UK/Commonwealth country bilaterals, third countries did indeed scale back their outstanding o\u00a4ers to the United States and its Commonwealth bargaining partners at the same time that the United States and its Commonwealth bargaining partners reoriented their o\u00a4ers toward these third countries, consistent with the view that important rebalancing with third countries occurred after the collapse of the US-UK/Commonwealth country bilat- erals and therefore with the view that the attainment of multilateral as opposed to bilateral reciprocity was an important feature of the Torquay Round. Overall, the evidence from the bargaining records of the Torquay Round sup- ports two important claims. First, this evidence con rms that the bargaining behavior in the Torquay Round can be usefully interpreted through the lens of the terms-of-trade theory, suggesting in turn that this theoretical framework cap- tures an important component of what governments were trying to achieve when they created GATT. And second, it con rms that there is an economic logic to the pillars of GATT\u0092 s architecture when it comes to the bargaining forum that these pillars helped to create, and that the apparently non-strategic nature of the bargaining behavior induced by these pillars arguably contributed importantly to the success of GATT tari\u00a4 bargaining relative to what had come before. Of course, as I alluded to earlier, it is not self-evident that the terms-of-trade driven prisoner\u0092 s dilemma that seems to lie at the heart of the problem that the GATT was created to address 75years ago is still the central problem that a trade agreement should be designed to address today. And even if the goal isto help governments escape from their terms-of-trade driven prisoner\u0092 s dilemma, the evidence I have reviewed here does not imply that GATT\u0092 s architecture is perfect or that it cannot be improved upon. But at a minimum, this evidence suggests that the GATT architecture warrants respect \u0096not because it seems to produce \u0093good outcomes,\u0094but because it seems well-designed to address an important problem and can therefore claim a deeper legitimacy \u0096and that the GATT/WTO should not be discarded in favor of a new institutional approach without an understanding of what would be lost. In their discussion of the meaning of legitimacy in the context of global governance institutions more generally, Buchanan and Keohane (2006, p. 407) put the point this way: Judgments about institutional legitimacy have distinctive practical impli- cations. Generally speaking, if an institution is legitimate, then this legit- imacy should shape the character of both our responses to the claims it makes on us and the form that our criticisms of it take. We should support or at least refrain from interfering with legitimate institutions. Further, 83agents of legitimate institutions deserve a kind of impersonal respect, even when we voice serious criticisms of them. Judging an institution to be legit- imate, if \u0087 awed, focuses critical discourse by signaling that the appropriate objective is to reform it, rather than to reject it outright. 5. Tari\u00a4 Bargaining Without GATT/WTO Rules In the previous two chapters I have argued that the terms-of-trade theory can be helpful in interpreting what countries achieve (Bagwell and Staiger, 2011) as well as what they do not achieve (Ludema and Mayda, 2013) in GATT tari\u00a4 negotiations, and I have argued that the impacts of the GATT bargaining forum on observed bargaining behavior can be understood and interpreted through the lens of this theory (Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu, 2020a). As I have noted, from this perspective the design features of the GATT/WTO appear to be aimed at helping member governments escape from a terms-of-trade driven prisoner\u0092 s dilemma, and these design features display an underlying logic that arguably contributed to the e\u00a2 cacy of GATT/WTO tari\u00a4 bargaining relative to the attempts at tari\u00a4 bargaining that came before it. But what does the terms-of-trade theory say about the e\u00a2 cacy of tari\u00a4 bar- gaining in the absence of these rules? And can the theory be used to evaluate the case for changes in the rules that govern tari\u00a4 bargaining in the GATT/WTO? In this chapter I discuss recent research that begins to address these questions. I rst consider what theory alone can tell us, focussing on the ndings of Bagwell and Staiger (2005) and Bagwell, Staiger turn to Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu (2021), who combine a model of tari\u00a4 bargaining with a quantitative trade model to assess the impacts of changes in the GATT/WTO tari\u00a4 bargaining protocol, focusing on the role of MFN. 5.1. Theory Recall from the theoretical discussion in chapter 4 that, in the presence of the GATT/WTO pillars of MFN and reciprocity, countries wanting a less ambitious tari\u00a4 agreement will get their way and there will be insu\u00a2 cient tari\u00a4 liberaliza- tion relative to what is needed to reach the e\u00a2 ciency frontier; as I described there, the only exception to this is when the distribution of market power wielded by governments happens to be symmetric across countries so that their negotiations reach the political optimum. And as I noted in chapter 3, insu\u00a2 cient tari\u00a4 liber- 84alization is also a MFN tari\u00a4 bargaining in Ludema and Mayda (2013) even when reciprocity is not imposed, as the free-riding under MFN in that setting prevents countries from liberalizing enough to eliminate all of the imprints of market power from their tari\u00a4 choices and reach the e\u00a2 ciency frontier. These ndings raise the natural question of whether governments might be able to nego- tiate to outcomes closer to the e\u00a2 ciency frontier within the GATT/WTO if the MFN restriction were removed. Any claim that the removal of MFN is the magic bullet for achieving e\u00a2 - ciency in a multi-country tari\u00a4 bargaining setting is put in doubt by the results of Bagwell and Staiger (2005). Bagwell and Staiger work with a three-country two-good general equilibrium trade model along the lines of the model I described in chapter 4, and focus on the following question: If countries were somehow able to nd their way to a point on the e\u00a2 ciency frontier, what rules for bilateral negotiations would be su\u00a2 cient to keep them there? Bagwell and Staiger restrict attention to points on the e\u00a2 ciency frontier where each government would prefer to unilaterally raise its tari\u00a4 and would experience a welfare reduction when its export good is confronted with a higher tari\u00a4 from a trading partner. Noting that these restrictions guide attention to points on the e\u00a2 ciency frontier that are consistent with the nature of GATT tari\u00a4 bindings, and considering initially a tari\u00a4 bargaining setting in which the reciprocity principle is not operative, they show that in the absence of MFN, even if countries were positioned at a point on the e\u00a2 ciency frontier they are not likely to stay there, as the home country and either of its trading partners could increase their joint welfare by engaging in discriminatory tari\u00a4 liberalization together at the expense of the third country. This is made clear in Figure 5.1, which is adapted from Figure 1 in Bagwell and Staiger (2005). With the home country\u0092 s discriminatory on from foreign-country idenoted by iand foreign-country i\u0092 s tari\u00a4 on imports from the home country denoted by \u0003ifori2f1;2g, and with ion the vertical axis and \u0003i on the horizontal axis, Figure 5.1 depicts the position of the iso-welfare contours of the home country and foreign countries iandj6=ithat must prevail at any point on the e\u00a2 ciency frontier consistent with the nature of GATT tari\u00a4 bindings. The key point is that, as Figure 5.1 displays, emanating from any such e\u00a2 cient set of tari\u00a4s there must be a downward lens described by the iso-welfare contours of the home country and foreign-country iinto which these two countries could jointly liberalize in a discriminatory fashion and enjoy mutual gains at the expense of foreign-country j. In this sense, Bagwell and Staiger argue that in the absence of MFN (and reciprocity), allpoints on the e\u00a2 ciency frontier that are consistent 85with the nature of GATT bindings are susceptible to \u0093bilateral opportunism.\u009449 To understand why this must be the case, recall that when the home country imposes discriminatory tari\u00a4s there will be separate world prices that apply to its trade with each partner, pwifor its trade with foreign-country iandpwjfor its trade with foreign-country j; and with foreign-country s welfare . Figure 5.1W\u0003j(p\u0003j( \u0003j;epwj);epwj), its iso-welfare contour in Figure 5.1 simply iso- epwjlocus (because \u0003jis xed in Fig- ure 5.1),which is negatively sloped under standard assumptions. The downward lens then implies that, by jointly reduc- ing their tari\u00a4s on each other\u0092 s imports slightly from an e\u00a2 cient starting point, the home country and foreign-country ican, through the resulting trade di- version from foreign-country j, worsen foreign-country j\u0092 s terms of trade (re- duceepwj) and thereby take surplus from it, and convert its loss into their own mu- tual gain. For example, in the special case where all three governments are concerned only about the level of real national income and where they began from the e\u00a2 cient point of mutual free trade, Fig- ure 5.1 would simply re\u0087 ect the fact that the home country and foreign-country iwould su\u00a4er only a second-order loss from exchanging small discriminatory im- port subsidies with each other, and would together enjoy a rst-order gain from the improvement in the terms-of-trade that the home country would then experi- ence with foreign-country j.50An analogous statement applies equally well when the government objectives take the more general form introduced in chapter 2. And it can also be seen that an e\u00a2 cient point cannot look any other way than as depicted in Figure 5.1: if the lens were in the upward direction then all three 49Bagwell and Staiger (2005) also demonstrate that in the absence of MFN the bilateral opportunism problem persists for a signi cant set of points on the e\u00a2 ciency frontier even when the reciprocity principle is introduced as a constraint on tari\u00a4 bargaining. 50As Bagwell and Staiger (2005) demonstrate, while it is the home country that enjoys the direct bene t of the terms-of-trade improvement with foreign-country jfrom this maneuver, the downward adjustments in iand \u0003ican always be made in such a way as to ensure that foreign\u0096 country ishares in these gains. 86countries could gain from a small increase in both iand \u0003i, contradicting the e\u00a2 ciency of the initial point; and the same is true if the iso-welfare contours of the home country and foreign-country iwere tangent. The bilateral opportunism problem that arises in the absence of MFN suggests that countries would not be able to sustain an e\u00a2 cient tari\u00a4 agreement in the absence of MFN and would instead be induced to over-liberalize to tari\u00a4 levels that lie below the e\u00a2 ciency frontier. Bagwell and Staiger (2005) also show that MFN alone is not enough to eliminate the possibility of bilateral opportunism, though they show that it does change the nature of the problem: under MFN, there can be a bilateral incentive to either liberalize tari\u00a4s below or raise tari\u00a4s above the e\u00a2 ciency frontier, depending on the characteristics of the particular point on the e\u00a2 ciency frontier at which countries are initially positioned. In fact, Bagwell and Staiger (2005) show that MFN can eliminate the possibil- ity of bilateral opportunism only when it is joined with reciprocity. This provides further theoretical support for the proposition that these two principles together represent a solid foundation for the GATT/WTO architecture. Recall though, that, as noted above, when MFN and reciprocity are applied rigidly in tari\u00a4 nego- tiations, there will typically be insu\u00a2 cient tari\u00a4 liberalization relative to what is needed to reach the e\u00a2 ciency frontier; so while the rules of MFN and reciprocity would secure a position on the e\u00a2 ciency frontier once reached, it is unlikely that such a position can be reached under those rules. This brings back into focus the speci c question that Bagwell and Staiger (2005) are asking in this paper, namely, which rules for bilateral negotiations would be su\u00a2 cient to keep countries on the e\u00a2 ciency frontier if they were initially positioned there. Bagwell and Staiger do not study a speci c extensive-form game of tari\u00a4 bargaining, and therefore they cannot say where the equilibrium bargaining outcome would actually end up given a speci c set of rules. And this means in turn that they cannot provide an answer to the question whether the bargaining outcome absent MFN is better or worse for the world than the outcome in the presence of MFN, especially since according to their ndings both bargaining outcomes are unlikely to be e\u00a2 cient. An answer to this question is provided by Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu (2020b) and the working paper version, Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu (2018), which extend the results of Bagwell and Staiger (2005) to a speci c tari\u00a4 bar- gaining game where equilibrium bargaining outcomes with and without MFN can be derived. In particular, Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu consider an envi- ronment where the home country is engaged in tari\u00a4 bargaining bilaterally and 87simultaneously with each of its two foreign trading partners, along the lines of the simultaneous bilateral bargains that occurred under the bargaining proto- cols of many of the GATT rounds. And Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu adopt the \u0093Nash-in-Nash\u0094 equilibrium solution concept of Horn and Wolinsky (1988), wherein the outcome of simultaneous bilateral bargaining is characterized by a Nash equilibrium between separate bilateral Nash bargaining problems. Accord- ing to the Nash-in-Nash solution, any given bilateral negotiation results in the Nash bargaining solution taking as given the outcomes of the other negotiations. As Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu (2020b) discuss, the Nash-in-Nash solution concept has pluses and minuses when used to represent simultaneous bilateral tari\u00a4 bargaining in the GATT/WTO. On the plus side, it is a tractable solution concept that has been widely applied in the Industrial Organization literature to provide quantitative assessments of situations that involve bilateral bargain- ing with externalities; and in other work that I will describe below, Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu (2021) employ this solution concept in combination with a quantitative trade model to assess the e\u00a2 cacy of alternative tari\u00a4 bargaining protocols. On the minus side, the Nash-in-Nash solution concept requires only that the solution be immune to bilateral deviations. It does not, for example, allow the possibility that a country involved in multiple bilateral tari\u00a4 bargains might consider pulling out of all of its bilaterals together; and it implies that the participation constraint must hold at the bilateral level but need not hold at the multilateral level.51In adopting the Nash-in-Nash approach, the view expressed by Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu (2020b), and the view that I take here, is a pragmatic one: namely, that GATT/WTO tari\u00a4 negotiations are complex, with no one currently available bargaining model able to adequately re\u0087 ect all these complexities; and in this light, the Nash-in-Nash equilibrium solution provides a potentially valuable approach, albeit only one such approach, for exploring the e\u00a2 ciency properties of bilateral tari\u00a4 negotiations in various settings.52 51That is, under the Nash-in-Nash solution concept, a country must prefer its equilibrium tari\u00a4 agreement in a bilateral relative to disagreement in that bilateral, but it need not prefer the overall multilateral tari\u00a4 agreement to an alternative in which the round fails and all countries return to their status quo tari\u00a4s. 52As I discussed in chapter 4, if countries are assumed to stick rigidly to MFN and (multi- lateral) reciprocity in their bilateral bargains then strategic considerations are completely elim- inated, and Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu (2020a) o\u00a4er support for this interpretation of the GATT tari\u00a4 bargaining protocol in the context of the Torquay Round. The paper by Ludema and Mayda (2013) that I discussed in chapter 3 attempts to capture elements of the GATT tari\u00a4 bargaining setting with a bargaining protocol that features a di\u00a4erent set of simpli cations, most 88When the Nash-in-Nash approach is applied to an analysis of bilateral discrim- inatory tari\u00a4 bargaining (and in the absence of the reciprocity principle) in the three-country two-good model described above, Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu (2020b) are able to demonstrate a formal sense in which this bargaining does in fact result in excessive liberalization and lead to a point below the e\u00a2 ciency frontier, much as is suggested by the ndings of Bagwell and Staiger (2005). To formalize this Staiger and Yurukoglu focus on Nash-in-Nash equi- libria of the bilateral discriminatory tari\u00a4 bargaining game that yield tari\u00a4s that are interior (i.e., equilibria where tari\u00a4s/import subsidies do not reach their lower bounds and drive local prices to zero) and that, as with the e\u00a2 cient tari\u00a4s studied in Bagwell and Staiger (2005), are consistent with the nature of GATT tari\u00a4 bind- ings (i.e., equilibria where each government would prefer to unilaterally raise its tari\u00a4 and would experience a welfare reduction when its export good is confronted with a higher tari\u00a4 from a trading partner). According to the Nash-in-Nash so- lution concept, such tari\u00a4s must imply the tangency conditions in each bilateral that are illustrated in the two panels of Figure 5.2. Figure 5.2 In panel a of Figure 5.2, which is associated with the bilateral between the home country and foreign-country 1, the home country\u0092 s discriminatory tari\u00a4 notably the existence of side payments in the form of lump sum transfers that allow the choice of tari\u00a4s to be separated from the division of surplus within each bilateral. In addition, as I observed in note 42, the economic model that Ludema and Mayda adopt does not feature the possibility that the third-party spillovers from MFN could be mitigated by a balance of tari\u00a4 cuts in the bilateral, a feature that can arise (though is not imposed via a reciprocity rule) in the model employed by Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu (2020b). 89imposed on imports from foreign-country 1, 1, is depicted on the vertical axis, and foreign-country 1\u0092 s tari\u00a4 on imports from the home country, \u00031, is depicted on the horizontal axis; and panel a holds xed at the equilibrium Nash-in-Nash level the tari\u00a4s ^ 2and^ \u00032that the home country and foreign-country 2apply to each other\u0092 s trade. Panel b of Figure 5.2 provides the analogous information for the bilateral between the home country and foreign-country 2, holding xed at the equilibrium Nash-in-Nash level the tari\u00a4s ^ 1and^ \u00031that the home country and foreign-country 1apply to each other\u0092 s trade. As the two panels of Figure 5.2 display, at the Nash-in-Nash equilibrium tari\u00a4s, the parties in each bilateral are at a tangency of their respective iso-welfare contours, taking the equilibrium outcomes in the other bilateral as given. Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu (2020b) demonstrate that these lie below the e\u00a2 ciency frontier \u0096and thus that the Nash-in- Nash equilibrium of the discriminatory tari\u00a4 bargaining game exhibits excessive tari\u00a4 liberalization \u0096in the following sense. First, they show that, beginning from the Nash-in-Nash equilibrium point illustrated in Figure 5.2, it is always possible to generate Pareto gains for all three countries by increasing all four tari\u00a4s. And second, they show that, beginning from the Nash-in-Nash equilibrium point, it is not possible to generate Pareto gains for all three countries unless at least one of the four tari\u00a4s is increased. This answers the question whether the outcome of bilateral discriminatory tari\u00a4 bargaining will indeed end up below the e\u00a2 ciency frontier: when the Nash-in-Nash solution concepts is applied, the answer is \u0093Yes.\u0094 The remaining question is whether this outcome is better or worse than the outcome of bilateral MFN tari\u00a4 bargaining. In their working paper, Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu (2018) include an analysis of bilateral MFN tari\u00a4 bar- gaining. Because their analysis is couched in a three-country two-good general equilibrium setting, the Nash-in-Nash solution concept is di\u00a2 cult to apply in a meaningful way when the home country is restricted to an MFN tari\u00a4, because this means that in its two bilaterals the home country is making o\u00a4ers on a sin- gle (MFN) tari\u00a4, a bargaining protocol that is on its face incompatible with the Nash-in-Nash approach. As Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu discuss, this issue re\u0087 ects in part the low-dimensionality of the model they work with: if each coun- try were importing multiple goods and each country were to negotiate its tari\u00a4 on any given import good only with the single principal supplier of that good, the Nash-in-Nash solution concept would extend in a straightforward way to the consideration of MFN tari\u00a4s. And in part the issue also re\u0087 ects the choice to abstract from the intricacies of the tari\u00a4 binding \u0096 which as noted, de nes the 90legal maximum level above which a country agrees not to raise its tari\u00a4 \u0096in the modeling of tari\u00a4 negotiations: in reality multiple exporting countries sometimes do negotiate and reach agreement over bindings on the same MFN tari\u00a4, because the negotiating right itself can have value in a later dispute over the binding; and a model that captured this feature of tari\u00a4 bindings might more naturally accommodate the Nash-in-Nash solution in the presence of MFN tari\u00a4s.53 Be that as it may, Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu (2018) proceed with the assumption that under bilateral MFN tari\u00a4 bargaining each country negotiates its tari\u00a4on any given import good only with the single principal supplier of that good. In their three-country two-good model, this means that there is in fact only one bilateral bargain in the case of MFN tari\u00a4 bargaining, between the home country and the principal supplier of exports of xinto its market, say, foreign-country 1. So the \u0093Nash-in-Nash\u0094 analysis of MFN bilateral tari\u00a4 bargaining then focuses on the single Nash bargain between the home country and foreign-country 1over the tari\u00a4s and \u00031. Given this Yurukoglu that the bilateral MFN leads to tari\u00a4s that are typically ine\u00a2 cient and that can exhibit either over- or under-liberalization to varying degrees. These ndings mirror those under MFN in Bagwell and Staiger (2005), where as I noted above it is shown that MFN alone cannot eliminate the bilateral opportunism problem but does change the nature of the problem, which can in the presence of MFN generate bilateral incentives to either liberalize tari\u00a4s below or raise tari\u00a4s above the e\u00a2 ciency frontier, depending on the characteristics of the particular point on the e\u00a2 ciency frontier from which countries are initially positioned. In any case, with Nash-in-Nash solutions under both MFN and discriminatory tari\u00a4 bargaining leading to ine\u00a2 cient outcomes, there is no obvious a priori rank- ing across these two protocols. This provides an answer to the question whether the outcome achieved absent MFN is better or worse than the outcome achieved in the presence of MFN. The answer, according to the Nash-in-Nash solution concept adopted in Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu (2018, 2020b), is \u0093It depends.\u0094 Evidently, theory alone cannot say whether tari\u00a4 bargaining outcomes in the GATT/WTO would be improved upon or hindered if the MFN principle were abandoned, so turning to quantitative methods (\u0093theory with numbers\u0094 ) to answer 53That said, recall from chapter 4 that in their analysis of Torquay Round bargaining data Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu (2020a) report that on average 1:25exporting countries bargain with an importing country over a given tari\u00a4; so the assumption of negotiating on a given tari\u00a4 only with a single principal supplier (which Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu, 2018, adopt) is close to what is observed in the GATT bargaining data, at least for the Torquay Round. 91this question seems warranted. This is the approach of the paper by Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu (2021), to which I now turn. 5.2. Quantitative trade modeling of Uruguay Round tari\u00a4 bargaining As I mentioned above, as a way to model situations characterized by bilateral bar- gaining with externalities, a key advantage of the Nash-in-Nash solution concept is its tractability. Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu (2021) exploit this tractabil- ity and employ the Nash-in-Nash approach to study simultaneous bilateral tari\u00a4 bargaining under alternative bargaining protocols with and without MFN in a quantitative trade model based on Caliendo and Parro (2015). I describe here the approach and main ndings of the Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu paper. The Caliendo and Parro (2015) model is a version of the many-country multi- sector continuum-of-goods perfectly competitive Ricardian models of Eaton and Kortum (2002) and Costinot, Donaldson and Komunjer (2011), extended to in- clude an input-output structure whereby intermediate goods are used as inputs into nal goods. Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu estimate the parameters of this trade model with 1990 data on trade, production, input-output \u0087 ows, tari\u00a4s and \u0093gravity\u0094variables (e.g., to 67sec- tors ( 49traded, 18non-traded) for six key industrialized countries \u0096the United States, the EU, Japan, Canada, South Korea and Australia \u0096and with the rest of the world aggregated into ve regional entities. They then use the predicted trade patterns from the model to identify a set of viable tari\u00a4-negotiating country pairs, and they use the negotiated tari\u00a4 outcomes of the Uruguay Round to estimate the parameters of a tari\u00a4 bargaining model layered on top of the trade model, where these country pairs bargain bilaterally and simultaneously. More speci cally, to model tari\u00a4 bargaining in the Uruguay Round, Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu assume that countries abide by a bargaining protocol with three features: countries negotiate only over MFN tari\u00a4s and cannot engage in bilateral bargaining over discriminatory tari\u00a4s; they respect their existing tari\u00a4 bindings and cannot raise tari\u00a4s above bound levels in their bilaterals;54and their bilaterals are structured according to the principal supplier rule. Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu do not impose reciprocity on the bargaining outcomes, though they 54The multilateral rounds that are the focus of Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu occur under Article XXVIIIbis, and the purpose of such negotiations is to achieve reductions in the levels of tari\u00a4 bindings. Tari\u00a4 o\u00a4ers that violate existing bindings would instead have to occur in the context of an Article XXVIII renegotiation and include the bargaining partner with which the original tari\u00a4 concession was negotiated. 92do assess the degree to which the predicted bargaining outcomes from the model conform to a reciprocity norm. Finally, they abstract from political economy and other distributional motivations and assume instead that countries seek to maximize their real national income, an assumption that, as they observe, is at odds with important features of reality but is closest to the spirit of the Ricardian trade model within which they work. Treating 1990 as the benchmark year for the Uruguay Round ( 1986\u00001994) of GATT negotiations, the model\u0092 s predicted trade \u0087 ows can be used to identify principal supplier status at the country-sector level, from which Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu then construct viable bilateral bargaining pairs for the Round ac- cording to the model. These are the pairs of countries that, in 1990 and according to the model, are each principal suppliers of at least one product into the other country\u0092 s market. According to the model\u0092 s predictions, Bagwell, Staiger and Yu- rukoglu identify seven viable bargaining pairs that involve ve of the six industrial countries negotiating over 151tari\u00a4s covering 55%of1990 world trade in indus- trialized goods: for comparison, according to the data at this level of aggregation there are 12viable pairs that involve all six industrial countries and would nego- tiate over 214tari\u00a4s covering 61%of1990 world trade in industrialized goods.55 The di\u00a4erence between model predictions and data in this regard re\u0087 ects the fact that the estimated model does not predict the trade \u0087 ows in the data with perfect accuracy. To be consistent with the model, Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu use the model-predicted trade \u0087 ows to identify the viable bargaining pairs. Armed with the model-consistent structure of the bilateral bargaining country pairs in the Uruguay Round, and focusing only on tari\u00a4 bargaining and therefore abstracting from the set of broader non-market-access issues covered in the Round, Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu then adopt the Nash-in-Nash solution concept, wherein the outcome of the simultaneous bilateral bargaining of these country pairs is characterized by a Nash equilibrium between separate bilateral Nash bar- gaining problems. And they select as their estimates of the bargaining powers across countries in each bilateral those bargaining power parameters that allow the model predictions of Nash-in-Nash tari\u00a4 bargaining outcomes to most closely 55Of the six industrial countries included as separate entities in the trade model, Canada is the one that according to model estimates fails to meet the \u0093mutual principal supplier\u0094criterion necessary for a viable bilateral bargain. As Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu note, this re\u0087 ects in part the fact that US-Canada trade is excluded from the principal supplier calculations, because as a consequence of the US-Canada Free Trade Agreement in place in 1990 the US and Canada did not negotiate over each other\u0092 s MFN tari\u00a4s in a bilateral in the Uruguay Round. 93match the actual tari\u00a4 bargaining outcomes of the Uruguay Round. According to these estimates, Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu nd that Japan was the strongest bargainer in the Uruguay Round while the United States and Australia were the weakest, although they caution that these bargaining power estimates have large standard errors and should be taken with a similarly large grain of salt. Importantly, Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu nd that under MFN there was insu\u00a2 cient tari\u00a4 liberalization, in the sense that the bargaining pairs did not achieve free trade or the outcome that would have maximized world real income according to the model.56According to their estimates, the Uruguay Round tari\u00a4 negotiations under MFN achieved roughly one third of the world real income gains that could have been achieved if countries had found a way to negotiate all the way to free trade on the tari\u00a4s they were negotiating in the Round. This \u0093un nished business\u0094suggests that the free-rider force associated with MFN is at work, and it provides a possible opening for an alternative bargaining protocol that abandons MFN and allows countries to negotiate instead over discriminatory tari\u00a4s. And that is the counterfactual that Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu consider. In particular, to evaluate the impact of the abandonment of MFN on tari\u00a4 bargaining, Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu re-solve their model for the Nash-in- Nash bargaining equilibrium under the assumption that the same bargaining pairs that according to the model bargained over MFN tari\u00a4s in the Uruguay Round continue to bargain with each other under the same bargaining powers when MFN is abandoned, and that in a given bilateral each pair bargains over all tari\u00a4s that either party in that pair had bargained over in the presence of MFN, but now does so with discriminatory tari\u00a4 cuts o\u00a4ered only to the bargaining partner in the bilateral. The discriminatory counterfactual analyzed by Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu therefore focuses on the intensive margin (i.e., depth of tari\u00a4 cutting activity) impacts of abandoning MFN, abstracting from any extensive margin (i.e., breadth of tari\u00a4 cutting activity) impacts that this might have. Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu report two main ndings. First, they that abandoning MFN would result in ine\u00a2 cient tari\u00a4s, and that this over-liberalization is su\u00a2 ciently pronounced that it would lead to a deterioration in world-wide welfare relative to the negotiated outcomes in the 56As Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu note, given that there exist tari\u00a4s in the world that were not under negotiation in the Uruguay Round according to their model-consistent bargaining pairs, free trade in the tari\u00a4s that were under negotiation would not necessarily maximize world real income. In fact, they nd in light of these pre-existing distortions that some import subsidies would be required to maximize world real income. 94presence of MFN. In fact, according to their results, if tari\u00a4 bargaining in the Uruguay Round had proceeded without the MFN requirement, the resulting tari\u00a4 agreement would have wiped out the world real income gains that MFN tari\u00a4 bargaining in the Uruguay Round produced and would have instead lead to a small reduction in world real income relative to the 1990 status quo level, a result that is possible under Nash-in-Nash bargaining because, as noted above, the participation constraint need only hold at the bilateral level. And second, they nd that MFN has a dampening e\u00a4ect on the expression of bargaining power that would be lost in the absence of MFN, with the weaker bargainers (the US and Australia according to their estimates) losing the most from the abandonment of MFN and the strongest bargainers (Japan according to their estimates) actually gaining when the MFN restriction is removed. It is interesting to re\u0087 ect on these quantitative ndings in light of the theoreti- cal results of Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu (2018, 2020) described above. While the theory indicates that Nash-in-Nash bargaining in the presence of MFN could result in either ine\u00a2 cient under- and Yurukoglu (2021) indicate that for the Uruguay Round it was under-liberalization in the presence of MFN that was the problem. And while the theory indicates that Nash-in-Nash bargaining in the absence of MFN must result in ine\u00a2 cient over-liberalization, the quantitative ndings indicate that this bargaining would have led to ine\u00a2 cient over-liberalization in the Uruguay Round of such a magnitude that it would have resulted in an actual decline in world real income relative to the 1990 status quo. The MFN nding re\u0087 ects the dominance of positive third-party externalities associated with reductions in the MFN tari\u00a4s negotiated in each bilateral of the Uruguay Round, and Bagwell, Staiger and Yu- rukoglu quantify these externalities and con they are indeed positive.57 The discriminatory tari\u00a4 ndings re\u0087 ect the power of the negative externalities that are unleashed when countries compete to reduce tari\u00a4s on a discriminatory basis across bilaterals, and Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu also quantify these externalities and con rm that they are indeed negative. In this regard, it is also interesting to note that according to Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu\u0092 s ndings, discriminatory tari\u00a4 bargaining would look like a winning proposition to each bar- gaining country relative to MFN tari\u00a4 bargaining if those countries viewed each of their bilaterals in isolation: it is only when the equilibrium implications of the competitive tari\u00a4-cutting across bilaterals that arises in the absence of MFN is 57As the MFN results of Bagwell and Staiger (2005) and Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu (2018) con rm, in theory these third-party externalities could be either positive or negative. 95taken into account that the true cost of the abandonment of MFN is revealed. Finally, I mentioned above that, while Bagwell, Staiger and Yurukoglu do not impose reciprocity on the bargaining outcomes of the Uruguay Round in their model, they do assess the degree to which the predicted bargaining outcomes from the model conform to a reciprocity norm. Their ndings indicate that among bar- gaining countries there are only modest departures from multilateral reciprocity, with these departures bearing little relationship to estimated bargaining powers, reinforcing the conclusion that MFN has a dampening e\u00a4ect on the expression of bargaining power in tari\u00a4 negotiations. And among non-bargaining countries, they nd that departures from reciprocity were more signi cant and always in a direction that was favorable to these countries, re\u0087 ecting the ability of these countries to free-ride on the MFN tari\u00a4 cuts of others. 5.3. Interpreting Trump\u0092 s (one-sided) trade war I close this chapter with a brief discussion of the Trump Administration\u0092 s tari\u00a4 actions, or what in chapter 1 I referred to in passing as Trump\u0092 s \u0093one-sided\u0094trade war. It might seem strange to include such a discussion in a chapter on tari\u00a4 bargaining, but as I now argue following Mattoo and Staiger (2020), these trade actions can be interpreted as the Trump Administration\u0092 s attempt to implement power-based tari\u00a4 bargaining, the antithesis of the rules-based tari\u00a4 bargaining facilitated by the GATT/WTO. As such, this episode provides an illuminating window into how power-based tari\u00a4 bargaining works (or does not work). A broad caricature of these trade actions is as follows. The Trump Administra- tion took unilateral actions to raise tari\u00a4s. Its injured trading partners responded with countermeasures that amounted to reciprocal tari\u00a4 hikes of their own. In some cases the Trump Administration responded to these countermeasures with further punitive unilateral tari\u00a4s, which led to further countermeasures from its trading partners, some of which were reciprocal and some of which were less than reciprocal. In the end, several bilateral deals were struck, some of which involved the reciprocal removal of tari\u00a4s, and others of which involved the avoidance of threatened further tari\u00a4 increases by the Trump Administration but with most of the already-imposed tari\u00a4s remaining in place pending possible further deals.58 Two observations are in order. First, I refer to this as a one-sided trade war, 58The de nitive time line of the events associated with the Trump Administration\u0092 s trade ac- tions is provided on Chad Bown\u0092 s blog at https://www.piie.com/blogs/trade-investment-policy- watch/trump-trade-war-china-date-guide. 96because it is clear that the Trump Administration was initiating a trade war and that its trading partners were not engaging. In response to the initial Trump tari\u00a4s, US trading partners responded with countermeasures that were in line with the GATT/WTO reciprocity principle. And as the Trump Administration then reacted with further punitive tari\u00a4 escalations, at each escalation US trading partners responded with either reciprocal or, in some cases, less-than-reciprocal tari\u00a4increases of their own. In abiding by the reciprocity principle, these responses amounted to textbook \u0093countermeasures commensurate with the action which occasions them\u0094 of the sort described by the US Council of the ICC report on GATT from which I quoted in chapter 1. And despite the escalations by the Trump Administration, with their reciprocal responses US trading partners were able to \u0093hold in check emotional reactions which might result in punitive measures by countries injured against the country responsible for the injury,\u0094 as the ICC report suggested that GATT\u0092 s reciprocity principle was intended to do.59In short, this was a one-sided trade war, with the United States playing the role of the aggressor and US trading partners attempting to tailor their responses to stay within the bounds of the rules-based trading system.60 A second observation is this: it seems fairly clear that the Trump tari\u00a4s were viewed by the Trump Administration, not as an end in themselves, but as bar- gaining tari\u00a4s ; that is, as tari\u00a4s that were raised above the levels to which the United States had committed in existing trade agreements in order to bring US trading partners back to the bargaining table and adjust the terms of existing trade agreements in favor of the United States. In this light, Mattoo and Staiger (2020) argue that the Trump tari\u00a4s can be interpreted as a crude attempt by the Trump Administration to implement the vision of the global trading system artic- ulated by Trump\u0092 s Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in the passage I quoted in 59Of course, the reciprocity principle does give the injured country some leeway over which products to place on its retaliation list, and countries often place on these lists their trading partner\u0092 s most politically sensitive products so as to increase the cost of the trading partner\u0092 s actions within the bounds of reciprocity (see for example the account of the EU retaliation to the Bush US steel safeguard actions of 2002 in Rosegrant, 2006; and see Fajgelbaum, Goldberg, Kennedy and Khandelwal, 2020, and Kim and Margalit, 2021, for evidence that China\u0092 s response to US tari\u00a4s was consistent with this behavior). But reciprocity still constrains the overall volume of trade that can be subject to retaliation. 60That said, there were also some interesting responses from US trading partners that would be di\u00a2 cult to interpret from a straightforward application of reciprocity within the context of the terms-of-trade theory of trade agreements. For example, as Bown (forthcoming) documents, at the same time that China was reciprocally retaliating bilaterally against the US during this period, it was unilaterally lowering its applied MFN tari\u00a4s toward the rest of the world. 97chapter 1. More speci cally, Mattoo and Staiger argue that these actions amount to a US-led e\u00a4ort to repeal the rules-based trading system and replace it with a power-based system where countries are free to bargain in a way that is not constrained by a particular set of agreed-upon rules of behavior.61I will return to this interpretation in chapter 12. But for now, the important point is that the world may have just experienced what power-based tari\u00a4 bargaining looks like, and the initial indications are that it is not pretty.62 Finally, while I am not aware of academic papers that have examined the e\u00a2 cacy of the Trump Administration\u0092 s speci c approach to tari\u00a4 bargaining as compared to a rules-based approach, a number of recent papers have exploited the aggressive use of tari\u00a4s by the Trump Administration and the tari\u00a4 responses of its trading partners to investigate how local and world prices respond to the im- position of tari\u00a4s. These include papers by Amiti, Redding and Weinstein (2019), Fajgelbaum, Goldberg, Kennedy and Khandelwal (2020) and Cavallo, Gopinath, Neiman and Tang (2021).63Interestingly, each of these papers nds very little response of foreign exporter prices to the imposition of the Trump tari\u00a4s. The ndings of these papers are surprising, as they would seem to suggest that the United States is a small open economy, a nding that would go against a large body of existing evidence to the contrary (as reviewed, for example, in Bagwell, Bown and Staiger, 2016). This suggestion is not quite correct: the estimation employed by Fajgelbaum, Goldberg, Kennedy and Khandelwal (2020) controls for country-time and product-time e\u00a4ects, and as a consequence is unable to pick up foreign exporter price e\u00a4ects of tari\u00a4s that operate through relative wage or other factor-price changes at the country or sector level; and hence, as 61An interesting and open question is what formal role the adoption of bargaining tari\u00a4s actually plays; that is, why couldn\u0092 t bargaining tari\u00a4s remain as o\u00a4-equilibrium threats? One possibility is that, by applying these high tari\u00a4s, the Trump Administration was establishing the credibility of its threat to follow through with high tari\u00a4s if its bargaining partners did not acquiesce. And likewise, by responding with reciprocal countermeasures, its bargaining partners were signaling their commitment to avoid bargaining with the US in a power-based setting and instead to stay within the rules-based system. 62See, for example, the early evaluations of the bilateral deals that have resulted from the Trump Administration\u0092 s trade actions, available on Chad Bown\u0092 s blog at https://www.piie.com/blogs/trade-investment-policy-watch/trump-trade-war-china-date- guide. Notice also that, under the bargaining tari\u00a4 interpretation of Mattoo and Staiger (2020), the power-based tari\u00a4 bargaining attempted by the Trump Administration has similarities to the European experience with bilateral tari\u00a4 bargaining of the early twentieth century as described by Wallace (1933) and discussed in chapter 2. 63See also Flaaen, Hortacsu and Tintelnot (2020) for the particular case of washing machines. 98these authors emphasize (p. 3), their results do not imply that the United States is a small open economy unable to a\u00a4ect world prices.64But the estimation methodologies employed by Amiti, Redding and Weinstein (2019) and Cavallo, Gopinath, Neiman and Tang (2021) should in principle pick up all foreign exporter price e\u00a4ects of tari\u00a4s, so the ndings of these two papers do carry this implication. However, upon closer examination the ndings of these two papers may not be so surprising in relation to the existing evidence either, for at least two reasons. First, as these papers note, they are (by necessity) estimating only short-term responses of prices to tari\u00a4s. Amiti, Redding and Weinstein (2019) use monthly data from January 2017 to December 2018 to estimate the price e\u00a4ects of the Trump tari\u00a4s and the tari\u00a4 responses of US trading partners; but the bulk of these tari\u00a4s were not imposed until the spring and summer of 2018 (Trump safeguard tari\u00a4s on washing machines and solar panels are the exception \u0096they were imposed in January 2018), so these estimates re\u0087 ect the impacts of tari\u00a4s on prices over just a few months. As Amiti, Redding and Weinstein observe, if prices are sticky within this few-months horizon, then their estimation would miss price adjustments to the tari\u00a4s that occur at longer time horizons; and it is typically at longer time horizons that the evidence against the United States as tting the characteristics of a small open economy has been o\u00a4ered. Cavallo, Gopinath, Neiman and Tang (2021) extend the data analysis by eight months to August 2019, but (as they also note) a similar observation applies.65 A second and related reason that these ndings may not be so surprising relates to an observation I made above: if the Trump tari\u00a4s were viewed as bargaining tari\u00a4s, they were then likely seen as temporary but with a highly uncertain du- ration. And as Amiti, Redding and Weinstein (2019) observe, in the face of this uncertainty it is possible that foreign exporters would simply choose to \u0093ride out the storm\u0094rather than make price adjustments, a strategy that could make sense over a short time horizon but would not be viable in the longer term. So there is nothing necessarily contradictory between the nding shared by Amiti, Redding and Weinstein (2019) and Cavallo, Gopinath, Neiman and Tang 64Indeed, in their quanti cation of the welfare impacts of the Trump tari\u00a4s and the response from US trading partners, Fajgelbaum, Goldberg, Kennedy and Khandelwal (2020) adopt sector- level parameter assumptions for their general equilibrium model that imply that the United States is nota small open economy. 65Amiti, Redding and Weinstein (2020) extend their earlier analysis to cover data through October 2019, thereby covering a similar time horizon to Cavallo, Gopinath, Neiman and Tang (2021), and nd broadly similar results to their earlier analysis (with the notable exception of the foreign exporter price responses in the steel sector). 99(2021) \u0096 that foreign exporter prices did not fall in response to imposition of the Trump tari\u00a4s and therefore that the United States appeared to behave as a small country during this episode \u0096 and the ndings of the earlier literature that suggest the United States is a large country with considerable market power in world markets. Simply put, the resolution of these seemingly contradictory ndings may be that the nding shared by these two papers re\u0087 ects the short time horizon over which evidence of price e\u00a4ects was collected combined with the temporary and uncertain status of the tari\u00a4s themselves. Still, there is at least one remaining puzzle: when Cavallo, Gopinath, Neiman and Tang examine how US exporter prices respond to the foreign retaliatory tari\u00a4s, they do nd that US exporters reduced their prices in response to the retaliatory tari\u00a4s from US trading partners, and especially so in response to China\u0092 s tari\u00a4s. It is not clear why the above account would hold for foreign exporters to the United States but not equally hold for US exporters into China. Cavallo, Gopinath, Neiman and Tang o\u00a4er some potential explanations, but it is likely that additional work will be needed to provide a full accounting of these e\u00a4ects and a fully satisfactory resolution of the implications of these two papers with the existing literature. 6. The GATT/WTO as an Incomplete Contract Despite lling 24,000 pages, the WTO agreement, like all real-world contracts, is far from anything resembling a complete contract where the rights and obligations of each WTO member are speci ed for every possible future state of the world. And there are many features of the GATT/WTO that seem hard to square with a complete contracts perspective. This is true in the design of GATT/WTO rules, which display an interesting mix of rigidity and discretion: the tari\u00a4 binding is an obvious example of this mixture of rigidity (above) and discretion (below), but there are also many other examples, relating to the GATT/WTO treatment of non-tari\u00a4 policies, its non-discrimination provisions, its various escape clauses and its provisions for renegotiation. And it is true in the role of the GATT/WTO court, which is often called upon to play an interpretive or possibly gap- lling role regarding the provisions of the GATT/WTO contract. There is evidence that the designers of GATT were well aware of the inevitable incompleteness of the contract they were drafting and the importance of the de- sign choices they were making in this regard. For example, in his proposal for a liberal post-war trading system, which many regard as a \u0093 rst draft\u0094of what would ultimately become the GATT (see Culbert, 1987), James Meade empha- 100sized the trade-o\u00a4 between writing a more detailed and precise contract (which Meade referred to as the \u0093Charter for a Commercial Union\u0094 ) versus relying on the dispute settlement system (embodied in a proposed International Commerce Commission) to interpret the contract when disputes inevitably arise: If an attempt were made to draft a Charter for a Commercial Union of this type, one of the most important questions would be how precisely worded should be the de nition of the discriminations and degrees of protection that would be disallowed to members of the Union and of the actions which would be permitted or disallowed to state trading organisations. It is in this connection that the major dilemma is to be faced. If an attempt is made to de ne very rigidly and precisely exactly what any member may or may not do in all possible circumstances, it is probable that as circumstances change and as states introduce new methods of trading certain state measures may be precluded which it is not in the general intention of the Charter to disallow and certain other measures may be allowed which it is in the intention of the Charter to forbid. On the other hand, if the Charter is drawn up in much less precise terms and expresses only in the most general terms the types of protective device which it is intended to forbid and the general maximum degree of protection which it is intended to allow, then very great responsibility will rest upon the International Commerce Commission or similar body whose duty it was to interpret the Charter. The success of the Union will depend upon the formulation of the Charter in terms, which, on the one hand, do not attempt to put international trade into an impossible strait jacket and, on the other hand, do not impose upon the International Commerce Commission such a burden of semi-legislative duties that it could not bear. (Meade, 1942, reproduced in Culbert, 1987). The models that I have discussed thus far do not emphasize contractual incom- pleteness as a feature of the GATT/WTO contract. Even when the set of policies covered by a trade agreement is assumed to be incomplete, as when governments possess multiple policy instruments but only tari\u00a4s are the subject of negotia- tion, the literature I have described above is focused on whether such a shallow integration approach can nevertheless replicate a complete contract and reach the e\u00a2 ciency frontier when accompanied by GATT Articles that help to secure property rights over the negotiated market access implied by a tari\u00a4 commitment. In this chapter I shift focus and describe research that emphasizes the incom- pleteness of the GATT/WTO contract. I begin with the paper of Horn, Maggi 101and Staiger (2010), who evaluate the design of a number of GATT/WTO rules from an incomplete contracts perspective. I then turn to the paper by Maggi and Staiger (2011) who focus on the role of the court in resolving disputes. And nally, I describe the results of Staiger and Sykes (2017) who evaluate the role of what is perhaps Exhibit A for the proposition that the GATT/WTO is an incomplete contract, namely, the so-called \u0093non-violation\u0094 clause. Throughout the chapter my intent is not to argue that speci c features of the GATT/WTO correspond to the optimal incomplete contracts that these papers characterize, but instead to illustrate how a number of the broad features of GATT/WTO design can be seen to resonate with the contracting trade-o\u00a4s that are emphasized in these papers. 6.1. Rules The passage from James Meade quoted above suggests that the nature of incom- pleteness of the GATT/WTO contract resulted from the purposeful design choices of its drafters. Can these design choices be illuminated by considering the optimal choices that governments would make given the key features of the contracting environment that they faced when designing the GATT/WTO? The paper by Horn, Maggi and Staiger (2010) addresses this question, empha- sizing two fundamental challenges that governments face when designing a trade agreement: the agreement must keep in check the incentive of governments to act opportunistically on a wide array of policy instruments , both border policies and especially \u0093domestic\u0094 measures; and there is substantial uncertainty about the circumstances that will prevail during the lifetime of the agreement. These challenges mean that a complete contract would have to be comprehensive in its policy coverage, and it would have to be highly state contingent. But such a contract would be prohibitively costly to write, a view that is shared by many trade-law scholars. For example, on the impracticality of achieving comprehensive policy coverage in a trade agreement, Hudec (1990, p. 24) writes: \u0093The standard trade policy rules could deal with the common type of trade policy measure governments usually employ to control trade. But trade can also be a\u00a4ected by other \u0091 domestic\u0092measures, such as product safety standards, having nothing to do with trade policy. It would have been next to impossible to catalogue all such possibilities in advance.\u0094 And regarding state contingencies, Schwartz and Sykes (2002, pp. 181-84) write: 102\u0093 Many contracts are negotiated under conditions of considerable complex- ity and uncertainty, and it is not economical for the parties to specify in ad- vance how they ought to behave under every conceivable contingency....The parties to trade agreements, like the parties to private contracts, enter the bargain under conditions of uncertainty. Economic conditions may change, the strength of interest group organization may change, and so on.\u0094 To model these features, Horn, Maggi and Staiger follow an approach along the lines of Battigalli and Maggi (2002) and assume that contracting costs are increas- ing in the number of policies and state variables included in the agreement. In such a contracting environment, the choices to be made are how many and which policies to cover in the agreement, and what kind of policy contingencies, if any, to include. The rst choice determines how much policy discretion govern- ments will have under the agreement; the second choice determines how rigid the agreement will be. In general, the more rigid is the agreement (fewer state contin- gencies) and the greater the policy discretion allowed (fewer policies covered), the less costly the agreement will be to write, but the further will be its performance from the \u0093 rst-best\u0094 complete contingent contract. The question is then which features of the complete contingent contract are the most cost-e\u00a4ective to include in the agreement, and which are best to leave out. The answer to this question will determine the design of the agreement; and presumably, the answer will depend on the features of the contracting environment. Adopting a terms-of-trade per- spective on the purpose of trade agreements and allowing that governments have both border and domestic instruments and face uncertainty about the conditions that will prevail when their agreement is implemented, this is the basic question that Horn, Maggi and Staiger investigate. Horn, Maggi and Staiger\u0092 s analysis of policy discretion points to conditions under which the GATT\u0092 s shallow approach to integration that I described in chapter 3 could be optimal, even if the accompanying GATT Articles that are there to secure the property rights over the negotiated market access implied by a tari\u00a4 commitment fail to achieve their intended purpose. Of course, when there is a cost of including additional policies in the contract as Horn, Maggi and Staiger assume, it is not surprising that focusing the agreement on a subset of policies might be optimal once the contracting costs are taken into account. But Horn, Maggi and Staiger\u0092 s result goes further: they show that if only a subset of policy instruments is to be contracted over, and when the purpose of the trade agreement is to aid governments in their e\u00a4orts to escape from a terms-of-trade 103driven prisoner\u0092 s dilemma, the resulting agreement must take as its primary focus thetari\u00a4,notdomestic policies.66 To see the intuition for this nding, it is useful to consider rst the nding of Copeland (1990), who showed that when governments look to a trade agreement as a means of escape from a terms-of-trade driven prisoner\u0092 s dilemma, contracting on tari\u00a4s can always improve over the noncooperative equilibrium, even if other domestic policies are non-negotiable and left to be chosen unilaterally by gov- ernments after the negotiations have concluded.67As Copeland explains, this is because beginning from the noncooperative policy choices, when the home govern- ment agrees to reduce its tari\u00a4 by a small amount, it is constraining the rst-best instrument for reducing its import volume and manipulating the terms of trade, and it then attempts to compensate for the loss of unfettered use of its tari\u00a4 by us- ing its domestic instruments as second-best tools for restricting import volume; but as these are second-best instruments for this purpose, in the end the home govern- ment will not restrict its import volume as much as it did under its unconstrained noncooperative policy choices. For the home government\u0092 s welfare, none of this matters, because the rst-order conditions that are satis ed at its noncooperative choices ensure that it su\u00a4ers no rst-order welfare impact by slightly constraining its own tari\u00a4. But its trading partner enjoys a rst-order gain from the expansion of the home-country import volume. A completely analogous description holds when the foreign government also agrees to reduce its tari\u00a4 by a small amount beginning from its noncooperative policy choices. Hence, both governments are assured a higher level of welfare if, beginning from their noncooperative policy choices, they each agree to reduce their tari\u00a4 by a small amount and then make their own unilateral choices over their domestic, non-tari\u00a4 policies.68 66The assumption that the purpose of the trade agreement is to aid governments in their e\u00a4orts to escape from a terms-of-trade driven prisoner\u0092 s dilemma is important for this result: as a general matter, there is no guarantee that the result would hold. For example, if the purpose of the agreement is to help a government make commitments to its private sector, contracting over a domestic policy (e.g., production subsidy) can be better than contracting over a tari\u00a4, an implication of the ndings of Staiger and Tabellini (1987); see in particular their Proposition III and especially note 11. 67Domestic policies are assumed non-negotiable for exogenous reasons in Copeland (1990), because his analysis does not include contracting costs or other frictions that could give rise endogenously to contract incompleteness. 68That each government can bene t from the constraint placed on the other government\u0092 s tari\u00a4 when they both abide by these constraints can be con rmed by recalling from chapter 3 that the fundamental ine\u00a2 ciency associated with noncooperative policies in this setting can be described as one of insu\u00a2 cient market access. And the implications of the constraints on tari\u00a4s 104From this perspective, it can be understood why governments could notim- prove upon the noncooperative outcome if, beginning from their noncooperative policy choices, they agreed to a small change in their domestic policies but were allowed to choose their tari\u00a4s unilaterally. The reason is that, as the tari\u00a4 is the rst-best instrument for reducing import volume and as Horn, Maggi and Staiger establish, beginning from noncooperative policies and as long as the tari\u00a4 remains unconstrained, any agreement to change slightly the domestic policies from their noncooperative levels will induce compensating changes in the tari\u00a4 that fully o\u00a4set the impact of the changes in domestic policies on import volumes. This shuts down the one channel \u0096an expansion of import volume \u0096through which, as Copeland (1990) shows and as explained above, welfare improvements are gener- ated when instead tari\u00a4s are constrained, leaving only the second-order losses that each government su\u00a4ers from the constraints placed on its own domestic policies. Hence, when the problem to address is terms-of-trade manipulation, it is nec- essary that tari\u00a4s are among the set of policies over which governments negotiate: that is, shallow integration must take as its primary focus the tari\u00a4, not domestic policies. It is sometimes argued that GATT\u0092 s emphasis on contracting over tari\u00a4s re\u0087 ects the fact that border measures are more transparent than domestic policies and are therefore less costly to contract over. While this may well be true, the result of Horn, Maggi and Staiger indicates that there is also a more fundamental explanation for this basic feature of GATT/WTO design: it re\u0087 ects the nature of the problem that the agreement is designed to solve. Horn, Maggi and Staiger also present ndings on when discretion over domestic policies should be allowed in a trade agreement. To understand these ndings, it is helpful to consider in more detail the modeling setup that they adopt. Horn, Maggi and Staiger work within a multi-sector partial equilibrium trade model, similar to that described in chapter 3. They assume that governments choose their policies to maximize their real national income, and they therefore specify government objective functions along the lines of (a partial equilibrium analog of) the particular form given in (2.5) and (2.6); and they consider a trade agreement that would maximize the joint surplus of the two governments, WG\u0011W+W\u0003, sector by sector. Focusing on a sector for which the home country is an importer and the foreign country is an exporter, Horn, Maggi and Staiger ask whether the bene ts of adding a home-country domestic policy \u0014(in addition to the tari\u00a4 ) to the agreement is worth the contracting costs of doing so, and thereby whether moving from shallow to deep integration would increase the joint surplus of the that I have described in the text amount to a small expansion of each country\u0092 s market access. 105two governments once contracting costs are accounted for.69 To develop an expression that can be used to bound the bene ts of adding \u0014 to the agreement, Horn, Maggi and Staiger note that, for a given level of , the joint-surplus gained by deepening the agreement to include \u0014is given by \u0001WG joint surplus WGgiven \u0014shallow \u0014that maximizes home-country welfare Wgiven . In writing (6.1) I have assumed that an increase in \u0014improves the home country\u0092 s terms of trade, so that @pw=@\u0014 < 0, and it is straightforward to show that this ensures that \u0014shallow ( )> \u0014deep( ).70Note that by the \u0014deep( )we must haveWG \u0014(\u0014deep( ); ) = 0, and under the assumption that WGis concave in \u0014 we also have \u0014rises from\u0014deep( )to\u0014shallow ( ). Hence, it follows from (6.1) that if the maximum value of [\u0000WG \u0014(\u0014; )]over this interval of\u0014,[\u0000WG \u0014(\u0014shallow ( ); )], is small, then \u0001WG deep( )is small.71Finally, by the de nition of \u0014shallow ( )we \u0014(\u0014shallow [\u0000W\u0014(\u0014shallow \u0014(\u0014shallow ( ); )]: Therefore, for any level of contracting costs that would be incurred if \u0014were added to the agreement, shallow integration is guaranteed to be preferred to deep integration if [\u0000W\u0003 \u0014(\u0014shallow ( ); )]is su\u00a2 ciently small for the relevant range of (i.e., for the best tari\u00a4 under deep integration, the best tari\u00a4 under shallow integration, and all tari\u00a4s in between). What can be said about the magnitude of [\u0000W\u0003 \u0014(\u0014shallow ( ); )], the impact (taken positively) on foreign-country welfare of a small increase in the home- country\u0092 s domestic policy \u0014? Horn, Maggi and Staiger allow for the possibility of production and consumption externalities in any of a country\u0092 s import sectors, 69Horn, Maggi and Staiger derive results in the context of a domestic subsidy, but the results are more general and here I describe them in terms of any home-country domestic policy \u0014. 70This assumption is without loss of generality; if instead \u0014deep( )> \u0014shallow ( ), then the limits of integration in (6.1) would be switched, but everything else would be the same. 71As[\u0000WG \u0014(\u0014shallow ( ); )]becomes small, it must also be assured that the range of integra- tion in (6.1), \u0014shallow fast.\u0094See Horn, Maggi and Staiger (2010, note 18) for the technical conditions under which this is assured. 106and arm the importing-country government with domestic policies that can ad- dress these externalities in a rst-best way. But they assume that the exporting country experiences no externalities in its export sectors, and that it has no trade or domestic policies that apply to those sectors. This implies that the exporting government\u0092 s objective in each of its export sectors amounts to the sum of con- sumer and producer surplus in that sector. In this setting, and recalling the focus on an import sector for the home country, the impact on foreign-country welfare of a small increase in the home-country\u0092 s domestic policy \u0014is then given simply by the magnitude of the income e\u00a4ect of the induced terms-of-trade deterioration su\u00a4ered by the foreign country, which is in turn proportional to the volume of the home-country\u0092 s imports of this good from the foreign country; that is, we have [\u0000W\u0003 \u0014(\u0014shallow ( ); )] =M\u0002\u0012 \u0000@pw @\u0014\u0013 ; (6.2) where all magnitudes on the right-hand side of (6.2) are evaluated at and \u0014shallow ( ). Evidently, when M\u0002\u0000 \u0000@pw @\u0014\u0001 is small for the relevant range of , the cost to joint surplus of leaving \u0014to discretion is small. As Horn, Maggi and Staiger observe, (6.2) points to three conditions under which the cost of leaving \u0014to discretion will be small, so that omitting \u0014from the agreement will be an attractive way to save on contracting costs. The rst two conditions relate to the determinants of the magnitude of (\u0000@pw=@\u0014). If the importing country faces a highly elastic foreign export supply curve so that it has little market power on world markets, then (\u0000@pw=@\u0014)will be small; and if, as an instrument for manipulating the terms of trade, \u0014is a poor substitute for , the rst-best instrument for terms-of-trade manipulation, then again (\u0000@pw=@\u0014)will be small, regardless of how much market power the home-country has on world markets. With the magnitude of (\u0000@pw=@\u0014)su\u00a2 ciently small when either of these conditions is met, it will not be worth incurring the contracting costs to deepen the agreement to cover \u0014, no matter what the magnitude of the trade volume under a shallow agreement ( M) is. The third condition relates to the magnitude of the trade volume: if Mis su\u00a2 ciently small for the relevant range of , it will not be worth the contracting costs to deepen the agreement to cover \u0014no matter what the magnitude of (\u0000@pw=@\u0014)is. The upshot is that, according to these ndings, leaving a country\u0092 s domestic policy out of the trade agreement is likely to be an attractive way to save on contracting costs if the country has little monopoly power in trade , or if it trades little, or if the domestic policy is a poor substitute for import tari\u00a4s as a tool to 107manipulate terms of trade. The rst two conditions vary naturally across coun- tries, and they may also vary over time. As Horn, Maggi and Staiger note, such variation could help illuminate the general evolution that has occurred over time in the GATT/WTO toward tighter constraints on subsidies and other domestic policies as trade volumes have increased and the importance of trade in the world economy has grown, and in this light could also contribute to an explanation of the increasing tension between the forces of globalization and the preservation of national sovereignty. And this variation could help illuminate as well the ex- emptions from some of these commitments that the WTO provides to developing country members, whose trade volumes and extent of market power remain small. The combined increase in China\u0092 s market power and trade volume since its 2001 accession to the WTO may also help explain the growing attention that has been paid by WTO members to China\u0092 s subsidy and domestic policies in particular. The last condition varies naturally across instruments, and suggests an approach to determining which domestic policies to focus the negotiations on if a decision is made to deepen the agreement. There is also a further possible bene t of leaving a domestic policy out of the agreement, even when the cost of describing the policy in the contract is small. As Horn, Maggi and Staiger demonstrate, if in the complete contract the policy is state contingent, and if the cost of describing all of the relevant state variables in the contract is prohibitively high, then it may be better to leave the policy to discretion \u0096where the unilaterally chosen level of the policy will be susceptible to terms-of-trade manipulation but can at least be chosen by the government in a state-contingent way \u0096than the alternative of rigidly constraining the policy in the agreement. This nding resonates with the statement of Meade (1942) quoted above describing the futility of attempts to \u0093de ne very rigidly and precisely exactly what any member may or may not do in all possible circumstances... .\u0094 Horn, Maggi and Staiger then turn to a consideration of whether the agreement should be state contingent and, if so, what state variables should be included. An interesting nding here is that the incomplete contracts perspective provides a novel rationale for the inclusion of escape-clause type provisions in a trade agreement: a clause that makes the tari\u00a4 contingent on positive shocks to the import demand level \u0096broadly analogous to the GATT Article XIX escape clause \u0096 can be attractive, not because the complete state-contingent contract would include such a clause, but because in a shallow agreement the inclusion of this clause provides an indirect means of managing the distortions that arise when domestic policies are left to discretion. The potential attractiveness of such a 108clause can be understood once it is recalled from (6.2) that the joint-surplus cost of leaving a domestic policy to discretion rises with the import volume M. What Horn, Maggi and Staiger show is that it can be optimal from the point of view of the joint surplus of the two countries to allow the domestic government to respond to an underlying surge in import volume by raising its tari\u00a4 to tamp down the rise inM, and thereby keep a lid on the distortions to its unilaterally chosen domestic policies that would otherwise follow. Finally, Horn, Maggi and Staiger o\u00a4er an incomplete-contracts interpretation of the GATT/WTO\u0092 s reliance on the tari\u00a4 binding as the legal commitment that governments make to each other in their tari\u00a4 negotiations, and of the so-called \u0093national treatment\u0094(NT) clause that prohibits the use of internal tax and reg- ulatory policies that discriminate against imported products. Recalling that a tari\u00a4 binding de nes a legal maximum level for the tari\u00a4 to which it applies, it is intuitive that permitting a government to set a tari\u00a4 below this level whenever it desires to do so will be attractive if (a) the purpose of the agreement is to address terms-of-trade manipulation, and (b) to save on contracting costs, the binding is not state-contingent. Given (a), the joint surplus of the two governments must increase strictly if a government is permitted to lower its tari\u00a4 below its binding whenever conditions are such that it would wish to do so (i.e., conditions such that its binding is set above its reaction curve level for the tari\u00a4), because this would generate a Pareto improvement for the two governments. And given (b), with the binding not state contingent, a realized state could indeed arise under which the (rigid) binding is set above a government\u0092 s reaction curve tari\u00a4 level for that state, and if the binding were not de ned as a legal maximum so that the government in question could lower its tari\u00a4 below the binding then it could not take advantage of this opportunity for a Pareto improving reduction in its tari\u00a4. As for the NT clause, Horn, Maggi and Staiger demonstrate that the nature of discretion that a contract can allow under the NT clause is broader than what the contract can allow in the absence of the NT clause, and they argue that un- der certain conditions the new opportunities for discretion a\u00a4orded under the NT clause will be desirable to governments.72 72Focussing on the implications of NT for internal taxation, Horn, Maggi and Staiger demon- strate this by comparing the pricing relationships that must hold when internal taxation con- forms to NT and when it does not. Throughout, Horn, Maggi and Staiger restrict attention to simple instrument-based contacts that pin down speci c policy instruments (possibly in a state-contingent way). As they note, more sophisticated contracts that pinned down functions of multiple policy instruments could expand the contracting possibilities. A possible example of such a contract is the non-violation clause of GATT, which I discuss later in this chapter. 109It should be noted that the paper by Horn, Maggi and Staiger adopts the view that in designing their contracts governments deal with uncertainty about the conditions that will obtain over the life of the contract by either paying the cost to specify state-contingent commitments in their agreement or by allowing for some policy discretion to achieve state-contingency \u0093for free.\u0094An alternative possibility, and one that as I have described in chapter 2 is also prominently featured in the GATT/WTO, is to design rules for ex-post renegotiation of the commitments made in the contract should circumstances change. I close this section with a brief mention of the paper by Maggi and Staiger (2015) who, adopting an incomplete contracts perspective, focus on renegotiation and the design of these rules, and in particular on whether commitments in a trade agreement should be designed as property rules or rather liability rules . In the law-and-economics literature, property rules and liability rules refer to two fundamental ways that a right can be protected under the law (see Calabresi and Melamed, 1972). More speci cally these rules govern the way that a right can be exchanged between parties once ownership of the right has been initially assigned to one of the parties. To illustrate the di\u00a4erence between these rules in the context of a trade agreement, let us suppose that the home government has agreed to a policy of free trade, and has thereby granted the foreign government the right to expect that its exporters will not have to pay a tari\u00a4 to sell in the home-country market. If the home government subsequently wishes to impose a tari\u00a4, how will the foreign government\u0092 s right to expect free trade for its exporters be protected under the law? If the right is protected by a property rule, the home government must buy back its right to impose a tari\u00a4 in a voluntary transaction in which the value of the right is agreed upon by the two governments: this means that if the home government cannot get the foreign government to agree to its terms, it cannot impose a tari\u00a4. But if the right is protected by a liability rule, the home government must simply pay an objectively valued sum (typically determined by the court) to the foreign government: once that sum is paid, the home government can impose a tari\u00a4 whether or not the foreign government objects. Property rules and liability rules therefore de ne di\u00a4erent disagreement points for renegotiation, and the choice between them is considered by many legal schol- ars and trade policy practitioners to be a central issue for the design of a trade agreement.73Of course with renegotiation opportunities, if there were no trans- action costs the Coase theorem would apply, and the disagreement point, these rules, and indeed the trade agreement itself, would be irrelevant for the policy 73See, e.g., Jackson (1997), Schwartz and Sykes (2002), Lawrence (2003) and Pauwelyn (2008). 110outcome. But in settings where transaction costs are an important feature of the renegotiation environment, the choice between these rules can make a di\u00a4erence to the policy outcome, and legal scholars (e.g., Pauwelyn, 2008) have pointed to interesting variation in the choice between property and liability rules across GATT/WTO Articles as well as evolution in these choices through time. In their formal analysis Maggi and Staiger (2015) highlight a key transaction cost that is prominent in the speci c setting of trade agreements, namely, that compensation between governments is typically highly ine\u00a2 cient, often taking the form of \u0093self-help\u0094through court-authorized tari\u00a4 retaliation. In the presence of these costly ex-post government-to-government transfers, Maggi and Staiger show that the choice between property rules and liability rules is consequential, and that e\u00a2 ciency may be better served by property rules in some environments and by liability rules in other environments. And from this perspective, they illustrate how the broad logic of GATT/WTO choices over these rules, too, can be illuminated from an incomplete contracts perspective. 6.2. Disputes In the previous section I described the ndings of Horn, Maggi and Staiger (2010) regarding two kinds of contractual incompleteness, rigidity and discretion, that nd representation in the GATT/WTO agreement. Their formal analysis does not identify an explicit role for a dispute settlement body, but their ndings are suggestive of a trade-o\u00a4 between writing a more complete and precise contract ex ante and relying on a court to sort things out ex post, much as in the trade-o\u00a4 that Meade (1942) described in the passage quoted above; and it is often observed informally that the Dispute Settlement Body of the WTO plays an important role in helping to \u0093complete\u0094the incomplete WTO contract. In this section I describe the ndings of Maggi and Staiger (2011), who focus on the role of the court in a setting where trade agreements are incomplete contracts. To the two kinds of contractual incompleteness considered by Horn, Maggi and Staiger (2010), Maggi and Staiger add a third: the use of o\u00a4-the-shelf language in the contract that is virtually costless to write but is also imprecise or vague . Maggi and Staiger consider the design of an optimal institution that maximizes the ex-ante joint payo\u00a4 of the governments, where the institution is composed of a contract which can feature rigidity, discretion or vagueness, and a court whose mandate when invoked can be to modify, ll gaps in or interpret the contract, or simply enforce contractual obligations that are unambiguous. In addition to 111the introduction of vagueness as a form of contractual incompleteness, a novel feature of the formal setup introduced by Maggi and Staiger is the potential for an \u0093activist\u0094role for the court in settling disputes along the equilibrium path. To develop their ndings, Maggi and Staiger work within a partial equilib- rium two-country model, and focus on a sector where the home country plays the role of the importer and the foreign country plays the role of the exporter. The home government chooses a binary import policy 2fFT;Pg(Free Trade or Protection) in this sector, and its payo\u00a4 is W( ;'), where'\u0011('1;'2;:::;'N)is a vector of state variables, each corresponding to a binary event (e.g., '1\u0011\u0093there is/is not an import surge,\u0094 '2\u0011\u0093the domestic industry does/does not shut down,\u0094 etc.). The home government gains from protection in this sector in every state, that is, (')\u0011W(P;')\u0000W(FT;')>0for all', though the magnitude of these gains varies with the state ', re\u0087 ecting some combination of terms-of- trade and political/distributional considerations. The foreign (exporting) gov- ernment is passive in this sector, and its payo\u00a4 is given by W\u0003( ;'). The for- eign government always prefers that the home country adopt free trade, that is, \u0003(')\u0011W\u0003(P;')\u0000W\u0003(FT;')<0for all', with the magnitude of its loss from home-country protection also varying with '. Finally, by assumption transfers are not possible between governments at the ex-post stage (once the state 'is realized). Therefore, absent an ex-ante agreement between the two governments, the home government always chooses protection. At the ex-ante stage (i.e., before the state 'is realized), the two governments can create an institution consisting of a contract and a mandate for the court. Maggi and Staiger look for the institution that maximizes the expected joint surplus of the two governments, under the assumption that at this ex-ante stage governments can nd a way to make costless transfers so as to distribute the surplus between them.74Letting \u0000(')\u0011 (') + \u0003(')denote the joint gain for the two governments from protection in state 'and following Maggi and Staiger, I will say that the \u0093 rst-best\u0094policy in state 'is protection when \u0000(')>0and is free trade when \u0000(')\u00140, and I let !FTand!Pdenote the sets of states for which the rst-best policy is free trade and protection, respectively. Hence, for the 74As Maggi and Staiger note, the assumption that government-to-government transfers are available at the ex-ante stage when the trade agreement is being negotiated but unavailable at the ex-post stage when disputes arise can be justi ed on the grounds that GATT/WTO negotiating rounds typically extend beyond tari\u00a4 negotiations to include other issue areas as well, and that at this ex-ante stage care can be taken to include issue areas that can serve as indirect transfers (see, for example, Hoekman and Kostecki, 1995, pp 61-62). 112two governments the rst-best/expected-joint-surplus-maximizing outcome would have the home government choosing =FTfor'2!FTand choosing =Pfor '2!P. The question, then, is what combination of contract and court mandate can come closest to achieving the rst-best payo\u00a4 once the costs of writing the contract and litigating disputes are taken into account. What are the contracting possibilities open to the governments? Assuming that the payo\u00a4 levels of the governments are not veri able by the court but that the realized state 'is observed by both the governments and the court, the rst- best outcome could be implemented by a complete state-contingent contract that speci ed in detail all of the relevant state variables ('1;'2;:::;'N). Such a con- tract, however, would be very costly to write. Appealing to these contracting costs, Maggi and Staiger assume that the complete contract is unavailable, and they allow governments to choose instead among three contracting possibilities. A rst possibility is that the governments do not write a contract at all, and thereby avoid contracting costs completely by leaving the policy to discretion. The possibility of a discretionary contract of this kind can be interpreted as leaving a \u0093gap\u0094in the coverage of a broader contract when it comes to the policy . A second possibility is that the governments write a rigid contract that speci es =FTin all states, a contract without contingencies that Maggi and Staiger assume has a small cost to write. And the third possibility is that governments use o\u00a4-the-shelf language to write a vague contract , which Maggi and Staiger also assume has small writing costs and which pins down the rst-best policy unambiguously in some states of the world but whose interpretation is ambiguous in other states. For example, a clause in the contract stating that protection is allowed if the home-country\u0092 s import-competing industry su\u00a4ers \u0093serious injury due to increased imports\u0094 might be unambiguously met (or not met) in some states of the world, but in other states it might be open to interpretation. What about the mandate for the court? Here Maggi and Staiger consider four possibilities. Three of these are \u0093activist\u0094 in nature and paired with the three contract types described above: the court could be asked to ll gaps in a discretionary contract, it could be asked to interpret a vague contract when the meaning of the contract is not clear, or it could be asked to modify a rigid contract and provide an escape from commitments that were speci ed unambiguously in the contract. A fourth court mandate is \u0093nonactivist,\u0094 and consists of simply enforcing obligations that are stated crisply and unambiguously in the contract (unless modi ed under the modi cation mandate). In Maggi and Staiger\u0092 s model, it is always optimal for the court to be asked to serve at least this nonactivist 113role, regardless of the contracting option chosen by the governments; and in their formal analysis this role never leads to disputes in equilibrium, so it is kept in the background. The focus, then, is on which contracting option should be pursued, and whether or not it should be paired with an activist court mandate. Finally, regarding the settlement of disputes, Maggi and Staiger assume that invoking the court is costly, with the exporter government (complainant) incurring costc\u0003>0and the importer government (defendant) incurring cost c > 0. If invoked, the court is assumed to always follow its mandate; and if it is given one of the three activist mandates, the court attempts to complete the contract for the realized state as the governments would have done ex ante had they paid the cost to do so.75Speci cally, the court observes a noisy signal of \u0000and issues the ruling that maximizes the expected joint payo\u00a4 of the governments given the signal. The ruling is a policy determination which is automatically enforced \u0096in essence the contract is modeled as a property rule, as the home government must implement the policy ruling of the court and has no possibility of buy out \u0096and the court gets the ruling \u0093wrong\u0094 with probability qk(')wherek(')2[0;1=2] and whereq2[0;1]parameterizes the overall (inverse) quality of the court. With this setup, the optimal institution will correspond to one of six possi- bilities. The governments can write a vague, rigid or discretionary contract (no contract at all) and endow the court with a nonactivist enforcement-only mandate. Or they can write one of these contracts and endow the court with an activist mandate to interpret (for the vague contract), modify (for the rigid contract) or gap- ll (for the discretionary contract), in addition to its enforcement role. Not surprisingly, the quality of the court is a key factor in determining the optimal institution, but the precise manner in which court quality enters the determination is somewhat subtle. To illustrate this, recall from above that a dispute can occur along the equilibrium path in this model only if the court is invoked under one of its activist mandates; and notice that court behavior as modeled is the same regardless of which activist mandate is invoked. Suppose, then, that a state is realized for which an activist mandate for the court applies. The foreign government will le a complaint with the court in this state if and only if the home government chooses =Pand the foreign government expects a bene t from ling that exceeds the ling cost, or Pr(court ruling is FTj')\u0002j \u0003(')j>c\u0003: (6.3) 75As Maggi and Staiger note, this assumption about court behavior is broadly in line with the rules set out by the Vienna Convention (and adhered to by the WTO). 114And anticipating this ling behavior, the home government will choose =Pin this state if it can do so without triggering a dispute \u0096that is, if (6.3) fails to hold \u0096or if (6.3) holds and the home government expects a bene t from choosing to protect that exceeds its court costs in the dispute that it knows will follow: Pr(court ruling is Pj')\u0002 (')>c: (6.4) Notice that embedded in the above is the assumption that the two governments will forgo \u0093vigilante justice\u0094and will instead operate within the rule of law they have created, submitting to the court\u0092 s will in the event of a dispute. As the passage from Petersmann (1997, pp 82-83) quoted in chapter 2 describes, this was the essence of what governments hoped to achieve with GATT dispute settlement procedures that were \u0093designed to limit the customary law right of unilateral reprisals, whose exercise had contributed so much to the \u0091 law of the jungle\u0092in international economic a\u00a4airs during the 1930\u0092 s, and to introduce, as stated by one of the drafters, \u0091 a new principle in international economic relations. ...\u0092 .\u009476 Using (6.3) and (6.4), Maggi and Staiger demonstrate that equilibrium disputes will arise in this setting under two circumstances: either the importer government is acting opportunistically and chooses =Pwhen'2!FT, hoping to exploit the inaccuracy of the court and get away with protection when free trade would maximize the joint surplus of the governments; or the exporter government is acting opportunistically and les against protection when '2!P, hoping to exploit the inaccuracy of the court and force free trade when protection would maximize the joint surplus of the governments. And in either case, when a dispute arises there are two costs to the expected joint surplus of the governments: the cost associated with an erroneous court ruling, and the court costs borne by each government. In fact, Maggi and Staiger show that the bene cial impacts of an activist court all occur o\u00a4 equilibrium in the \u0093shadow\u0094of the court, when there is no dispute: as long as candc\u0003are not above a threshold level, the rst-best outcome is achieved for a given state 'if and only if the court is not invoked .77 Hence, if the quality of the court is high, there will be little room for oppor- tunistic behavior as long as the court is given an activist mandate, and the optimal 76Maggi and Staiger\u0092 s model does not o\u00a4er a formal explanation of why governments would wish to submit to a court in this way, but in their conclusion they o\u00a4er some thoughts on a multi-country extension of their model that could provide a formal explanation. 77The threshold limits on candc\u0003are needed for the \u0093if\u0094 part of this statement, because these limits ensure that the foreign government will always le against =Pfor'2!FTand the home government will always choose =Pfor'2!Peven if that triggers a court ling. See Maggi and Staiger (2011, note 21) for details. 115institution will simply minimize contract writing costs. As Maggi and Staiger ex- plain, this argues for leaving gaps in the contract when the quality of the court is su\u00a2 ciently high, and giving the court a mandate to ll them if a dispute should arise. It is interesting to note that the optimality of an extreme reliance on the court in these circumstances runs counter to the more balanced approach sug- gested by Meade (1942) who, as quoted above, argued that \u0093[t]he success of the Union will depend upon the formulation of the Charter in terms, which, on the one hand, do not attempt to put international trade into an impossible strait jacket and, on the other hand, do not impose upon the International Commerce Commission such a burden of semi-legislative duties that it could not bear.\u0094The reason for this prescriptive di\u00a4erence is that Maggi and Staiger\u0092 s analysis high- lights the o\u00a4-equilibrium e\u00a4ects of the court: as they note, when the quality of the court is su\u00a2 ciently high, its impacts are allo\u00a4 equilibrium, so that in fact it has no duties to actually bear. For levels of court quality in an intermediate range, Maggi and Staiger nd that writing a vague contract and giving the court a mandate to interpret is optimal. The fact that the o\u00a4-the-shelf language of the vague contract pins down the rst-best policy unambiguously in some states of the world makes its low writing cost worthwhile relative to simply leaving a gap in the contract, and an activist court of intermediate quality can still on net be worthwhile through its bene cial o\u00a4-equilibrium e\u00a4ects on government behavior. Finally, if court quality is below a threshold level, the opportunistic government behavior that an activist court mandate invites will be too costly and the bene cial o\u00a4-equilibrium e\u00a4ects too weak, and it is better not to grant the court an activist mandate. In this case it is optimal to have either a vague or a rigid contract in combination with a nonactivist court that simply enforces obligations that are stated crisply and unambiguously in the contract. It is interesting to re\u0087 ect on the message of Maggi and Staiger\u0092 s analysis with regard to the desirability of an activist court. According to their analysis, if a dispute has occurred, in some sense the dispute settlement procedures have already failed, because court costs will be borne and the court may make an incorrect ruling. But the key question is how accurate the court is in resolving disputes overall. If it is reasonably accurate, then its bene cial impact lies not in the disputes that dooccur and that it resolves correctly, but rather in all the disputes that did not occur in its shadow. Finally, I mention here the related paper by Maggi and Staiger (2018). That paper begins from the modeling approach of Maggi and Staiger (2015) that I 116described brie\u0087 y in the previous section, where governments can renegotiate the contract ex post using costly transfers and where the optimal ex-ante contract can take the form of a property rule or a liability rule, but where no signal is observed by the court and where there are no disputes. And it extends that setting to one where the court, if invoked under an activist mandate, can observe a noisy signal of the joint bene ts from protection for the two governments, and where disputes occur in equilibrium, as in Maggi and Staiger (2011). In this extended setting, Maggi and Staiger (2018) demonstrate that, depend- ing on the accuracy of the signal observed by the court, the optimal contract can be a property rule (possibly with escapes triggered by the signal received by the court) \u0096if court accuracy is su\u00a2 ciently high \u0096or a liability rule (again possibly with escapes triggered by the signal received by the court) if court accuracy is su\u00a2 ciently low. And they show that according to the model, the early settlement of disputes should be less frequent when the disputes are over optimally designed property rules than when the disputes are over optimally designed liability rules. With data on the outcomes of 109GATT-era disputes and 348WTO-era disputes, Maggi and Staiger nd support for this prediction, and hence support for the po- sition that the basic structure of GATT/WTO rules re\u0087 ects an underlying logic that, if not optimal, is at least broadly sensible. 6.3. The non-violation clause I close this chapter with a discussion of the non-violation clause, one of the more unique features of dispute settlement in the GATT/WTO. This provision, which was an important focus of the drafters of GATT in 1947 (see Hudec, 1990) and whose relevance was rea\u00a2 rmed with the creation of the WTO in 1995 (see Peters- mann, 1997), allows one GATT/WTO member government to seek compensation from another for adverse trade e\u00a4ects of the other\u0092 s policies, even though those policies do not violate speci c obligation under the GATT/WTO agreement. That a GATT/WTO dispute could feature a non-violation complaint is it- self explicit acknowledgment that the GATT/WTO contract is incomplete and does not expressly address all of the potential policy measures that might un- dermine the GATT/WTO bargain. Moreover, according to the terms-of-trade theory of trade agreements, the non-violation clause is not a mere theoretical cu- riosum: it plays a central role in facilitating the shallow-integration approach of the GATT/WTO (see Bagwell and Staiger, 2001, 2006, and Staiger and Sykes, 2011, 2021). But the prominence given to the non-violation clause by its drafters 117and legal scholars and suggested by economic theory is not matched by the role it plays in observed GATT/WTO disputes, where non-violation complaints have at best been of minor importance (see, for example, Staiger and Sykes, 2013). In particular, GATT/WTO disputes that feature non-violation complaints have been both rare and mostly unsuccessful relative to disputes that feature more tra- ditional \u0093violation\u0094 complaints (alleging a breach of GATT/WTO obligations), raising the question whether the non-violation clause really plays any important role at all in the GATT/WTO. Of course, observed disputes re\u0087 ect only on-equilibrium impacts, and it is possible that the relatively minor on-equilibrium role of non-violation complaints belies an important role for the non-violation clause that occurs o\u00a4 equilibrium. Indeed, in the theoretical treatments of Bagwell and Staiger (2001, 2006) and Staiger and Sykes (2011, 2021), the impacts of the non-violation clause are essen- tially allo\u00a4-equilibrium, because the formal frameworks developed in those papers do not predict disputes along the equilibrium path. What is needed to provide a formal answer to this question is a formal framework that generates equilibrium disputes and incorporates the possibility of a non-violation complaint along with the violation complaint, so that an assessment can be made as to whether impor- tant o\u00a4-equilibrium impacts of the non-violation clause can coexist according to the framework with the relatively minor on-equilibrium role of the non-violation clause that has been observed in actual GATT/WTO disputes. In this section I describe the ndings of Staiger and Sykes (2017) who, building on Maggi and Staiger (2011), develop such a framework to evaluate the poten- tial importance of the non-violation clause. Staiger and Sykes begin with the binary tari\u00a4 choice of the home government 2fFT;Pgconsidered by Maggi and Staiger, and extend the home government\u0092 s choices to include as well a bi- nary choice over a domestic regulation r2fFT;Rg. With this extended setting as their starting point, Staiger and Sykes then introduce into the model di\u00a4erences in both the contracting possibilities and the possibilities for litigation across the two kinds of policy instruments, with the goal of incorporating the key features that distinguish violation from non-violation complaints into a model that generates trade disputes along the equilibrium path. To this end, Staiger and Sykes assume that the tari\u00a4 is covered by an ex- ante contract that takes the vague form introduced in the Maggi and Staiger (2011) analysis. Moreover, Staiger and Sykes assume that when invoked with a \u0093violation\u0094claim (i.e., a claim by the foreign government that the choice of =P in state'violates the commitment that the home government made under the 118contract), the court is given a mandate to interpret the vague contract over . And as in the Maggi and Staiger analysis, this claim is treated as a property rule: if the court rules for free trade, the home government must remove its tari\u00a4. However, consistent with a shallow integration approach, Staiger and Sykes assume that the domestic regulation is left outside the contract, or, in the ter- minology of Maggi and Staiger (2011), that it is covered by a discretionary con- tract; and Staiger and Sykes assume that the court is notgiven a mandate to ll gaps. Rather, if the foreign government wishes to dispute the choice of r=R by the home government, it must le a non-violation complaint which, consistent with GATT/WTO rules, is modeled by Staiger and Sykes as a liability rule as in Bagwell and Staiger (2001, 2006): if the court rules for free trade, the home government is under no obligation to remove the regulation, but if it does not re- move the regulation then the foreign government is owed compensation, the level of which is determined by the court.78 Finally, and again consistent with GATT/WTO rules, Staiger and Sykes as- sume that a non-violation complaint can also be led against the choice of =P, either by itself or together with a violation complaint; and again, and in contrast to the violation complaint, a non-violation complaint against =Pis treated as a liability rule. Staiger and Sykes assume that the foreign government pays a court costc\u0003for each claim that it les against a home-government policy choice, and the home government pays a court cost cfor each claim that it defends against. Importantly, if the non-violation complaint is led together with a violation com- plaint, the non-violation complaint will only be ruled upon by the court if the court rst rules against the violation complaint. This sequencing of court deci- sions follows GATT/WTO practice, and is in line with the principle of judicial economy, because the property rule/liability rule distinction across violation and non-violation claims implies that a ruling against the home government on the violation claim would render meaningless to the foreign government a subsequent ruling on the non-violation claim. In this setting, as in the original setting of Maggi and Staiger (2011), equi- librium disputes arise when one of the governments or the other is acting oppor- tunistically within the leeway o\u00a4ered by the incomplete contract and the potential 78Staiger and Sykes interpret their modeling of the treatment of domestic regulation as anal- ogous to Maggi and Staiger\u0092 s (2011) discretionary contract with a court mandate to ll gaps, with the proviso that the court ruling is in this case treated as a liability rule. In describing the Staiger and Sykes model here I nd it convenient to provide a slightly di\u00a4erent interpretation, but the two interpretations are substantively identical. 119errors of the court. But the extensions introduced by Staiger and Sykes allow the role of non-violation complaints in these disputes to be gauged at the same time that the implied o\u00a4-equilibrium importance of the non-violation clause can be assessed. Speci cally, Staiger and Sykes identify parameter ranges for their model under which the model can match qualitatively two stylized facts exhibited by non-violation and violation claims in observed GATT/WTO disputes; rst, there are substantial numbers of non-violation claims, but most of these claims are not ruled upon; and second, conditional on a ruling, the success rate of non-violation claims is low, both in absolute terms and relative to the success rate of violation claims. For model parameters within the implied range and therefore consistent with a relatively minor on-equilibrium role for the non-violation clause, Staiger and Sykes demonstrate that the o\u00a4-equilibrium impacts of the non-violation clause on the joint surplus of governments can be positive and substantial. To understand the intuition for Staiger and Sykes\u0092 ndings, it is helpful to consider how the foreign-government ling decisions and the home-government policy decisions from Maggi and Staiger (2011) as described by (6.3) and (6.4) are altered in this extended setting. To avoid a taxonomy of cases, Staiger and Sykes assume that there is no state in which the rst best involves both tari\u00a4 and regulatory intervention, and the same goes for the unilateral optimum policy choice of the home government. To characterize government decisions, Staiger and Sykes then partition the states of the world into three sets: the sets !FTand!P, denoting the sets of states for which the rst-best policy is respectively free trade FT \u0011 ( protectionP\u0011 is regulation R\u0011 ( =FT;r =R). The trade e\u00a4ects of protection and regulation are normalized to be the same, so that the foreign government is hurt equally by either home-government policy intervention, with its loss given by \u0003(')\u0011W\u0003(P;')\u0000W\u0003(FT;') =W\u0003(R;')\u0000W\u0003(FT;'). And the ranking of policy choices from the perspective of the joint surplus of the two governments is assumed to be given by P FT R for'2!P,R FT P for'2!RandFT P R for'2!FT: in words, when protection is rst best the alternative of free trade is better for joint surplus than regulation, when regulation is rst best the alternative of free trade is better for joint surplus than protection, and when free trade is rst best the alternative of protection is better for joint surplus than regulation. What ling behavior must the model predict if it is to account for the two stylized facts described above? In order for there to be substantial numbers of non-violation claims, most of which are not ruled upon, the model must predict 120substantial numbers of disputes in which the foreign government les both a viola- tion and a non-violation claim, and where the court rules in favor of the violation claim and therefore does not proceed to rule on the non-violation claim.79More- over, given that a violation complaint is involved, these disputes must be over the home government\u0092 s choice of protection P; and given that the accuracy of court rulings is assumed to be better than a coin \u0087 ip ( qk(')<1 2for all'), the quality of the court must be high (low q) and these disputes must occur in substantial numbers in !FTand/or!Rrather than in !P(because if they occurred in sub- stantial numbers in !P, a high-quality court would rule against the violation claim with high probability and would then proceed to rule on the non-violation claim). Finally, there must be very few disputes that erupt over the home-government\u0092 s choice ofRfor'2!R, because each of those disputes would involve only a non-violation claim, and each such dispute would lead to a ruling on that claim. Turning to the second stylized fact, to ensure that the success rate of those non- violation claims that are ruled upon is low both in absolute terms and relative to the success rate of violation claims, and given that it has already been established that the quality of the court must be high to account for the rst stylized fact, the model must predict either a small number of disputes which involve a non-violation claim against the home-government\u0092 s choice of Rfor'2!R, or a small number of disputes which involve both a violation and a non-violation claim against the home-government\u0092 s choice of Pfor'2!P, or small numbers of both of these kinds of disputes. In the former case, the court rules upon the non-violation claim, and rules against it with high probability. In the latter case, the court rules upon the violation claim and rules against it with high probability and then rules on the non-violation claim and rules against that claim with high probability as well. The remaining question is what parameter ranges of the model, beyond the lowqidenti ed above, would be needed to deliver this ling behavior. To identify these ranges, Staiger and Sykes adopt the small-litigation-cost (small candc\u0003) focus of Maggi and Staiger (2011). To account for the stylized facts exhibited by non-violation and violation claims in observed GATT/WTO disputes, they then turn their primary attention elsewhere, and highlight the cost of government-to- government transfers and the degree to which non-tari\u00a4 policies are good substi- 79Settlement is another way in which claims made in a GATT/WTO dispute are not ruled upon, and the model of Staiger and Sykes abstracts from this possibility. But as Staiger and Sykes observe (see their note 31), the available evidence on settlement of violation versus non- violation claims in the GATT/WTO is not biased in the direction that would be needed to account for the relative paucity of rulings on non-violation claims. 121tutes for the tari\u00a4 for purposes of terms-of-trade manipulation. To re\u0087 ect these new features, Staiger and Sykes introduce two additional pa- rameters into the model. First, they assume that in the event of a successful non-violation claim against either PorR, the court sets the compensation level to be paid by the home government, b('), at the level of harm su\u00a4ered by the foreign government, \u0003('), so thatb(') =j \u0003(')j; but an \u0093iceberg\u0094transfer cost \u000e2(0;1)diminishes the amount of the transfer actually received by the for- eign government, b\u0003('), so thatb\u0003(') =\u000e\u0002b('). The parameter \u000etherefore captures the degree to which government-to-government transfers are costly in the context of a trade dispute, with a low value for \u000ecorresponding broadly to the GATT/WTO \u0093self-help reciprocity\u0094approach to compensation. And second, Staiger and Sykes parameterize the degree to which regulation Ris a good sub- stitute for protection Pfor the purpose of terms-of-trade manipulation with the parameter\u00122(0;1)and the assumption that R(') =\u0012\u0002 P(')for'2!FT, where R(')\u0011W(R;')\u0000W(FT;')and P(')\u0011W(P;')\u0000W(FT;'). In words, a low \u0012signi es thatRis a poor substitute for Pfor the purpose of terms- of-trade manipulation, and therefore that in !FTthe home government gains little in deviating from FTtoRas compared to what it would gain if it deviated from FTtoP(i.e., R(')is small compared to P(')for'2!FT). The upshot is that, once it is recalled that in the Staiger and Sykes model dis- putes arise only when one government or the other is behaving opportunistically, the relatively minor role of non-violation complaints in observed GATT/WTO dis- putes can be understood through the lens of this model as primarily attributable to two underlying forces, one that re\u0087 ects a feature of a second that re\u0087 ects a feature of the policy environment \u0096the low degree of substitutability between tari\u00a4s and domestic policies as a means of terms-of-trade manipulation. The foreign government\u0092 s incentive to use the non-violation claim opportunistically against e\u00a2 cient policy choices of the home government is kept in check by the level of compensation speci ed under GATT/WTO rules and the ine\u00a2 ciency of GATT/WTO compensation mechanisms (a low \u000ere\u0087 ecting self- help reciprocity). And the home government\u0092 s incentive to make opportunistic choices over non-tari\u00a4 policy instruments for ine\u00a2 cient terms-of-trade manipula- tion, choices that could trigger a non-violation claim, is kept in check by the low degree of substitutability between tari\u00a4s and such policies for this purpose (low \u0012). Together these features help to keep the frequency of non-violation rulings low. And given these features, the relatively common occurrence of non-violation 122claims led as opposed to ruled upon then re\u0087 ects the low dispute costs (low c and lowc\u0003) and high court accuracy (low q), which together ensure that there are substantial numbers of GATT/WTO disputes that involve opportunistic policy intervention (the choice of Pfor in!FT) and elicit the ling of both violation and non-violation claims that usually result in a (correct) court ruling in favor of the violation claim and no ruling on the non-violation claim. The high success rate of violation claims and low success rate of non-violation claims then re\u0087 ects the high accuracy of the court (low q) and a dispute selection e\u00a4ect caused by relatively high court costs for the complainant (highc\u0003 c).80 Under these parameter restrictions, what does the model imply about the po- tential importance of the non-violation clause? To answer this question, Staiger and Sykes examine the equilibrium behavior of the home and foreign government according to the model under these parameter restrictions when the non-violation clause is removed. In this counterfactual, the foreign government can only le a violation complaint, and it can only le it against P. This implies that the home government can always choose Rwith impunity. The question is, under the pa- rameter restrictions described just above, where the presence of the non-violation clause has only a minor on-equilibrium e\u00a4ect on the expected joint surplus of the two governments, could the presence of this clause still be having a large impact o\u00a4equilibrium? The answer, according to the model of Staiger and Sykes, is \u0093yes\u0094 if and only if a large drop in expected joint surplus is implied by the model when the non-violation clause is counterfactually removed. Staiger and Sykes are indeed able to nd parameter ranges where this is im- plied, and hence parameter ranges that describe a world consistent with the ob- served features of non-violation claims in GATT/WTO disputes and in which the non-violation clause nevertheless has important impacts. As they explain, these impacts stem from o\u00a4-equilibrium e\u00a4ects of the non-violation clause that operate for'2!Pand for'2!FT, where the presence of the non-violation clause has four positive e\u00a4ects. For '2!P, the presence of the non-violation clause can 80Staiger and Sykes show that the model requires a relatively high court cost for the foreign (complainant) government as compared to the home (respondent) government (highc\u0003 c), in order to ensure that the predictions are consistent with the second stylized fact described above. As they explain, this delivers a dispute selection e\u00a4ect, whereby most disputes arise because of opportunistic behavior on the part of the home government rather than the foreign government, and this accounts for the high success rate of violation complaints (see also Maggi and Staiger, 2011, for a similar observation). And the high quality of the court ensures that this e\u00a4ect does not extend to the success rate of non-violation complaints, owing to the censoring of court rulings on these complaints that is attributable to the sequencing of court decisions. 123convert an undisputed choice of Rinto a choice ofPthat leads to a violation complaint, which is good for joint surplus provided that q,candc\u0003are su\u00a2 ciently small. And for '2!FTthe presence of the non-violation clause can convert an undisputed choice of Rinto a rst-best choice of FT; it can convert an undis- puted choice ofRinto a choice ofPthat leads to a violation complaint which is good for joint surplus provided that q,candc\u0003are su\u00a2 ciently small; and it can convert a choice of Pthat would have been met with a violation complaint into a rst-best choice of FT. The o\u00a4-equilibrium e\u00a4ects of the non-violation clause in the model world iden- ti ed by Staiger and Sykes resonate with the way legal scholars describe the work- ings of the non-violation clause in the GATT/WTO. For example, in describing how the non-violation clause ts within the broader context of GATT/WTO \u0087 ex- ibilities such as those provided by the renegotiation provisions of Article XXVIII, Petersmann (1977) observes that the function of non-violation complaints in the WTO is to provide a check on the domestic policy autonomy of member-countries, \u0093... and to prevent the circumvention of the provisions in GATT Article XXVIII ... if a member, rather than withdrawing a concession de jure in exchange for compensation or equivalent withdrawals of concessions by a\u00a4ected contracting parties, withdraws a concession de facto.\u0094(p. 172). More broadly, in this model world, governments make e\u00a2 cient market access com- mitments with contracts over border measures while preserving policy autonomy over domestic taxes and regulations, and the non-violation clause functions mostly o\u00a4-equilibrium to reroute policy interventions into forms that are explicitly ad- dressed by the GATT/WTO contract and to thereby prevent the circumvention of these market access commitments, a function that is in line with the role empha- sized by economists and legal scholars and envisioned by the drafters of GATT. Part II Meeting the Challenges of the Twenty-First Century In the next ve chapters I consider a set of key challenges for the WTO that have arisen in recent decades as a result of changes in the world economy, and with 124which the WTO must contend if it is to remain an e\u00a4ective constitution of the world trading system for the twenty- rst century. My goal in these chapters is to distinguish between challenges that would require fundamental departures from the GATT/WTO approach to address and those that could plausibly be addressed through more modest adjustments to and/or better use of existing GATT/WTO principles and rules. Throughout I emphasize broad themes that can help guide the thinking on possible WTO reforms rather than the details of speci c reforms. First, there is a set of interrelated challenges for the WTO associated with the rise of the large emerging economies, including China. I discuss these challenges and research that relates to them in chapter 7. Next, chapter 8 takes up the challenges faced by the WTO in accommodating e\u00a4orts to address global climate change and the positive role that the WTO might play in addressing this issue. In chapter 9 I consider the implications of digital trade for the design of the WTO, considering trade in both goods and services. In chapter 10 I describe research that speaks to the rise of o\u00a4shoring and its implications for the e\u00a2 cacy of the design of the GATT/WTO, including its shallow integration approach. I conclude Part II with chapter 11, which focusses on speci c challenges to a shallow integration approach that are raised in the context of the growing calls for regulatory harmonization as an end in itself. 7. The Rise of Large Emerging Markets The rise in economic importance of the large emerging and developing economies has brought these countries to the forefront of the world economy, with China playing a leading role. This has created three interrelated challenges for the world trading system. I argue in this chapter that the WTO, with some possible adjustments, is in principle well-designed to address these challenges. First, there has emerged a substantial departure from reciprocity between China and its major industrialized trading partners. Below I suggest that the implied need for rebalancing market access commitments can be addressed with non-violation claims. Second, even once reciprocity between China and its ma- jor industrialized trading partners is established, there is a possibility that the Uruguay Round tari\u00a4 commitments made by industrialized countries now imply the grant of a greater level of market access than these countries are comfortable with. Below I suggest that the implied need for reconsideration of the level of mar- ket access commitments , where necessary, can be addressed with Article XXVIII renegotiations. And third, an asymmetry in the level of market access commit- 125ments between the developing/emerging economies and industrialized countries has emerged that is now hindering the ability of the former to gain from WTO membership. Below I suggest that this \u0093latecomers problem\u0094 can be addressed with Article XXVIII renegotiations between industrialized countries, followed by Article XXVIII bis negotiations between industrialized and developing/emerging countries. 7.1. Rebalancing market access commitments Industrialized countries have grown increasingly frustrated with the inability of WTO rules to e\u00a4ectively discipline China\u0092 s economic policies, owing to the non- market features of China\u0092 s economy. For example, in its 2020 Report to Congress on China\u0092 s WTO Compliance , the United States Trade Representative stated: ...China\u0092 s non-market approach has imposed, and continues to impose, sub- stantial costs on WTO members. In our prior reports, we identi ed and explained the numerous policies and practices pursued by China that harm and disadvantage U.S. companies and workers, often severely. It is clear that the costs associated with China\u0092 s unfair and distortive policies and prac- tices have been substantial. For example, China\u0092 s non-market economic system and the industrial policies that \u0087 ow from it have systematically dis- torted critical sectors of the global economy such as steel, aluminum, solar and sheries, devastating markets in the United States and other countries. China also continues to block valuable sectors of its economy from foreign competition, particularly services sectors. At the same time, China\u0092 s indus- trial policies are increasingly responsible for displacing companies in new, emerging sectors of the global economy, as the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party powerfully intervene on behalf of China\u0092 s domes- tic industries. Companies in economies disciplined by the market cannot e\u00a4ectively compete with both Chinese companies and the Chinese state. (USTR 2021, p 2) Similar frustrations about China\u0092 s economic policies have been voiced by the EU (see, for example, European Commission, 2016). Wu (2016, p 284) attributes this frustration not so much to any one speci c China policy or even a handful of speci c policies, but rather to China\u0092 s \u0093complex web of overlapping networks and relationships \u0096some formal and others informal \u0096between the state, Party, SOEs [State Owned Enterprises], private enterprises, 126 nancial institutions, investment vehicles, trade associations, and so on.\u0094Adding to this frustration is the fact that many of the distinct elements of China\u0092 s unique economic model were put in place after its 2001 accession to the WTO. But rather than re\u0087 ecting frustration with a bad-faith e\u00a4ort on the part of China to escape from its WTO commitments, it is more accurate to say that the growing frustra- tion among industrialized countries re\u0087 ects their unmet expectations that China would have by now evolved further in the direction of a market-oriented economy than it, in fact, has. Summarizing the nexus of non-market forces operating in China with the moniker \u0093China, Inc.,\u0094Wu puts the point this way: This is not to suggest that the Chinese concealed their true intentions. Throughout the 1990s, Chinese leaders openly and repeatedly stated that they sought to forge their own unique economic system. Moreover, eco- nomic developments in China\u0092 s reform era have proceeded largely through incremental rather than through radical, abrupt policy shifts. Thus, the development of China, Inc. should not be understood as a deliberate ex post act to circumvent WTO rules. (Wu, 2016, p. 292, footnotes omitted) As Wu (2016) describes it, China, Inc. poses a particularly subtle challenge for the WTO. This is because the pursuit of complaints against China\u0092 s policies through the WTO dispute settlement system has not been altogether unsuccessful in helping China\u0092 s trading partners address these concerns. As Wu documents, for certain kinds of issues, such as state-coordinated economic actions, local content requirements and state trading enterprises, the GATT/WTO legal framework has proven to be e\u00a4ective against those countries that have used such policies in the past, and it continues to be e\u00a4ective against China\u0092 s use of these policies. The real challenge lies in other issues raised by China\u0092 s policies \u0096the de nition of a \u0093public body\u0094in the context of de ning the reach of WTO disciplines on subsi- dies, or whether China\u0092 s trading partners can treat it as a non-market economy for purposes of administering their antidumping laws \u0096 which involve technical legal and factual questions that the WTO dispute settlement body has little prior experience resolving, with trade stakes that are potentially enormous. Left unad- dressed and in light of China\u0092 s sheer size, these issues have the potential to upset the fundamental balance between market access rights and obligations that lies at the core of the GATT/WTO bargain. They are the kinds of thorny issues posed by China, Inc. on which, Wu argues, the WTO could founder. So how should the WTO confront the China, Inc. challenge? To answer this question it is clarifying rst to pause and revisit a fundamental question that I 127considered in chapter 2: What is the purpose of a trade agreement? In chap- ter 2 I argued that the purpose of a trade agreement in a wide range of settings can be seen as expanding market access to internationally e\u00a2 cient levels. But in all of the settings I considered there, market forces \u0096subject to the kinds of government policy interventions that typify those found in market economies \u0096 were assumed to shape the decisions of rms and consumers everywhere. Does the purpose of a trade agreement change when one of the countries adopts an economic system like China, Inc.? Reassuringly, it is straightforward to see that the answer to this question is \u0093No,\u0094 as long as world prices continue to be de- termined via the international market clearing conditions that equate quantities demanded to quantities supplied on world markets.81This is because the fact that one country chooses to organize the economic activity within its borders under a policy regime that features important non-market elements does not alter the fundamental international externality \u0096namely, the world-price or terms-of-trade externality \u0096 that is generated by the unilateral policy choices of this country and the unilateral policy choices of its trading partners, and that underpins the essential insu\u00a2 cient-market-access problem for a trade agreement to solve. A simple way to see this is to think of noncooperative Nash policies as being determined in two steps: rst, facing the constraints imposed by international market clearing conditions, a national social planner in each country determines the economic magnitudes (the \u0093allocation\u0094 ) within its national borders; and sec- ond, in each country the national social planner then chooses whether to decen- tralize the implementation of the desired within-country allocation using a market system and appropriate tax/subsidy/regulatory policies, or whether instead to im- pose this allocation directly on its citizens by at. The choice made in this second step could be interpreted as determining whether a country is market-oriented or not. Choosing the rst option amounts to the familiar \u0093primal\u0094approach to solving the optimal policy problem, whereby the ctional planner decides on the allocation and then implements the desired allocation in a market economy with the appropriate policy instruments. Choosing the second option simply omits the use of markets to implement the desired allocation. But these choices will not 81As I will detail in chapter 10, a di\u00a4erent form of international price determination may be associated with the rise of o\u00a4shoring, and this can alter the purpose of a trade agreement from that which I have emphasized in chapter 2. Given China\u0092 s important role in global value chains, this raises a potential issue with the path for addressing the current impasse with China that I propose below. But that is a potential issue associated with o\u00a4shoring, not China per se, and I discuss the challenges to the WTO associated with the rise of o\u00a4shoring in chapter 10. 128impact the nature of the problem for a trade agreement to solve.82 Con rming that the purpose of a trade agreement is unchanged from that identi ed in chapter 2 when a country adopts an economic system like China, Inc. is clarifying, because it indicates that the challenge for the WTO posed by China\u0092 s entry into the world trading system is not to nd the capacity to evolve beyond its essential market-access focus in order to successfully accommodate China. Rather, the challenge, succinctly put, is this: the WTO must nd a way for China to make additional policy commitments, tailored to compensate for the non-market elements of its economy, that can serve the role of preserving the market access implied by its tari\u00a4 bindings, much as the role that GATT Articles play for market-oriented economies (see, for example, note 27). Evidently, there is no reason to think that China\u0092 s entry into the world trading system raises issues that are fundamentally inconsistent with the WTO\u0092 s underlying mandate. To the contrary, the market access orientation of the GATT/WTO provides a useful guardrail for what China should be willing to contemplate \u0096and what other WTO members have a right to expect \u0096in the context of its WTO commitments. In essence, then, the current circumstances that the WTO nds itself in with regard to China\u0092 s economic policies can be summarized as follows. Upon China\u0092 s 2001 accession to the WTO, its major industrialized trading partners believed that existing WTO rules, in combination with (a) the very substantial tari\u00a4 bindings and additional speci c market access commitments they had secured from China 82In chapter 2 I made use of the politically optimal point on the e\u00a2 ciency frontier (Bagwell and Staiger, 1999, 2002) to conclude that the purpose of a trade agreement is to eliminate the unilateral incentive that governments have to manipulate their terms of trade. As long as the underlying objectives of each government can be represented as a function of the within-country allocation \u0096and the local and world prices that would be needed to implement that allocation in a market economy \u0096as stipulated in (2.7)-(2.9), it is immaterial for those arguments whether governments actually choose to implement their desired within-country allocations through the decentralized mechanism of the market or rather through a command economy. This also helps to clarify what would cause a problem for my argument: if, for example, China sought to use its policies to maximize its share of world trade, then its objectives would depend on more than simply its within-country allocations \u0096its objectives would depend also on the trade volumes of other countries and therefore directly on their local prices \u0096 and the purpose of a trade agreement would no longer conform to the purpose I described in chapter 2. But notice that such an objective function would imply a di\u00a4erent purpose to trade agreements independent of whether this description t the government of a command or a market economy. So this has nothing to do with China as China, Inc. per se. That said, it is an interesting question whether or not China\u0092 s most recent 10 year plan announced in 2015, China 2025 (or for that matter, Industry 4.0 , the 10-15 year strategy announced by the German government in 2011) should be interpreted as an objective function driven by just such an explicit global-market-share target. 129as part of its accession negotiations and (b) their expectation that China would evolve strongly in the direction of a more market oriented economy, were su\u00a2 cient to ensure that China\u0092 s tari\u00a4 bindings represented market access commitments that would deliver the appropriate balance between rights and obligations. But the initial set of speci c commitments that China agreed to as a condition for accession to the WTO has turned out to be unsatisfactory for this purpose. This is not because China has failed to live up to its speci c commitments or to comply with WTO rulings against it when it has not.83Rather, it is because China has not evolved toward a market economy as quickly as these trading partners expected, and it does not now appear that China is likely to evolve toward a market-oriented economy as strongly as these trading partners once hoped. If this is an accurate summary of the China, Inc. challenge faced by the WTO, then the non-violation clause provides a promising path for WTO members to address the current impasse. This point is made forcefully by Hillman (2018) who, in describing the role of a non-violation claim in the context of her Congressional testimony about the best way for the United States to address the challenges created by China\u0092 s economic policies, observes:84 It is exactly for this type of situation that the non-violation nulli cation and impairment clause was drafted. The United States and all other WTO members had legitimate expectations that China would increasingly behave as a market economy\u0097 that it would achieve a discernible separation be- tween its government and its private sector, that private property rights and an understanding of who controls and makes decisions in major enter- prises would be clear, that subsidies would be curtailed, that theft of IP [Intellectual Property] rights would be punished and diminished in amount, that SOEs would make purchases based on commercial considerations, that the Communist Party would not, by at, occupy critical seats within major 83As Wu (2016) notes, many of the speci c commitments agreed to by China as part of its WTO Protocol of Accession (see WTO, 2001) can be litigated successfully in the WTO (and have been, where violation claims against it have been brought), so they are not the source of the challenge posed by China, Inc.. And on China\u0092 s record of compliance with WTO rulings against it, see Webster (2014) and Zhou (2019). 84The non-violation clause in the original GATT 1947 was incorporated into the WTO Agree- ments in GATT 1994, in the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), and in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). However, WTO members agreed to an extendable 5-year moratorium on the use of the non-violation clause in TRIPS, and this moratorium is still in place today. Hence, it is not clear that the non-violation clause could be utilized to address concerns about China\u0092 s intellectual property rights regime. 130\u0093private\u0094 enterprises and that standards and regulations would be pub- lished for all to see. It is this collective failure by China, rather than any speci c violation of individual provisions, that should form of the core of a big, bold WTO case. Because addressing these cross-cutting, systemic problems is the only way to correct for the collective failures of both the rules-based trading system and China. (Hillman, 2018, pp 10-11) Importantly, by focusing on the departure from reciprocity in market access commitments and the implied imbalance itself, rather than speci c policies that may have violated WTO legal obligations and led to this imbalance, the non- violation complaint can side-step the kinds of thorny legal and factual issues noted above and described by Wu (2016). This feature of non-violation complaints is highlighted by Sykes (2005) in the context of disciplines on domestic subsidies: A nice feature of the nonviolation doctrine is the fact that it does not re- quire subsidies to be carefully de ned or measured. A complaining member need simply demonstrate that an unanticipated government program has improved the competitive position of domestic rms at the expense of their foreign competition. (Sykes, 2005, p 98). Moreover, recall from chapter 6 that under a successful non-violation claim the defendant government is under no obligation to remove the measures at issue, but if it does not remove them then the claimant government is owed compensation, the level of which is subject to arbitration by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body. Hence, a non-violation claim would provide China with the freedom to decide whether and, if so, how best to o\u00a4er secure market access commitments to its trading partners that can reestablish reciprocity, with the knowledge that if its o\u00a4er of market access commitments is not su\u00a2 cient for this purpose then its trading partners have the right to restore reciprocity by withdrawing market access concessions of their own as part of the resolution of a successful non-violation claim. In this way, the non-violation clause would be serving the role it was designed to serve, namely, as Petersmann (1977, p. 172) observes, to provide a check on the domestic policy autonomy of member-countries, \u0093and to prevent the circumvention of the provisions in GATT Article XXVIII...if a member, rather than withdrawing a concession de jure in exchange for compensation or equivalent withdrawals of concessions by a\u00a4ected contracting parties, withdraws a concession de facto.\u0094 And crucially, any disagreements over the magnitude of the policy adjustments required to restore reciprocity between China and its trading partners 131would be referred to the relevant WTO dispute settlement bodies for a ruling, thereby keeping the resolution of these issues within the rules-based multilateral system.85 This perspective also yields an important insight into the nature of the chal- lenge that China, Inc. poses for the world trading system, and the choices that are available to the WTO membership to address this challenge. Recall from above that there were two elements to China\u0092 s accession negotiations: (a) a list of agreed speci c market access commitments, and (b) an expectation that China would evolve strongly toward a market economy. And recall that the imbalance between China\u0092 s market access rights and obligations has emerged as a result of the failure of (b): China has not evolved toward a market economy to the extent that its trading partners expected. Does this imply that the only solution is for China to now promise to evolve to a market economy at the speed and to the degree that ful lls those expectations? Not at all, because it is clear from the above that there is an alternative solution, and one that is more targeted to the underlying source of the trade tension. The alternative is for China to agree to additional speci c market access commitments of its own choosing, and therefore to compensate for the unanticipated non-market features of its economy and hence for the shortfall in part (b) by augmenting its speci c commitments in part (a); and this is what the non-violation clause can facilitate. Looked at in this way, there is no reason to think that, unless China chooses to relinquish China, Inc., \u0093decoupling\u0094China from the world trading system is the inevitable endgame.86 85What kinds of commitments might China o\u00a4er as a way to reestablish reciprocity? It is pos- sible that China might be able to nd certain policy commitments that would have clear market access implications without undermining core features of its chosen economic system. And it is possible that transparency issues would warrant the use of certain quantity commitments rather than tari\u00a4 commitments as a second-best tool for generating market access commitments, as were utilized in the GATT accession agreements for Poland and Romania (see, for example, Kostecki, 1974, and Haus, 1991). More generally, it is likely that a combination of measures might be needed to secure market access commitments from China, but it is also likely that China is in the best position to know what combination of measures would be most e\u00a4ective while minimizing inconsistencies with its desired economic system. 86Here my position diverges somewhat from Hillman (2018, p. 13), who describes the choice facing China as one of reforming its economic system or exiting the WTO. There is still the important question of whether China can, in fact, nd ways to make the needed additional market access commitments given the unique features of its economic system. And this would no doubt be a di\u00a2 cult task. But as observed above (see note 85), several of the non-market economies of Eastern Europe found creative ways to do this when they joined the GATT in the 1960\u0092 s and 70\u0092 s, suggesting that China might nd similarly unorthodox ways to make market 132Clarifying the challenge for the WTO posed by China, Inc. also has a po- tential side bene t. As is well known, bringing successful non-violation claims in the GATT/WTO is exceptionally di\u00a2 cult, and indeed this is so by design. As one WTO Panel report put it, \u0093... the non-violation nulli cation or impairment remedy should be approached with caution and treated as an exceptional con- cept. The reason for this caution is straightforward. Members negotiate the rules that they agree to follow and only exceptionally would expect to be challenged for actions not in contravention of those rules\u0094 (WTO, 1998a). But once it is understood that the goal of a non-violation claim is to nd a way to allow China to make meaningful market access commitments, and not to confront China with a choice between reforming its economy or decoupling from the world trading system, it becomes more likely that China might see it in its own interests to facilitate a successful rebalancing within the context of such a claim, and enlisting China\u0092 s support in bringing such a claim might even be feasible. This is because it is in China\u0092 s own interests, just as it is in each WTO member\u0092 s own interests, to be part of a world trading system that is e\u00a4ective in permitting the voluntary exchange of secure negotiated market access commitments between its members. And this is especially so if the current imbalances in the world trading system at- tributable to China\u0092 s accession to the WTO are putting the WTO at serious risk of foundering. So while enlisting China\u0092 s support in bringing such claims against it would be unprecedented, it is not unreasonable to attempt to do so given the unique challenge that China poses for the WTO and the world trading system. This is not to say that the more traditional WTO violation claims against China, where viable, should not also be brought, just as with viable violation claims against any WTO member. Indeed, in her testimony to Congress about the WTO case that the US should bring against China, Hillman (2018) lists 11 speci c issue areas where violation claims against China might be viable (and as Hillman notes, her list is not meant to be exhaustive). But as both Hillman and also Wu (2016) make clear, even if such violation claims were all successful they are not likely to address the fundamental sources of the imbalances that have access commitments that can respond to those non-market features of its economic system that were not anticipated by WTO members at the time of China\u0092 s WTO accession but that China wishes to preserve. And while nding e\u00a4ective disciplines on China\u0092 s subsidies will be particu- larly important and may ultimately entail reforms of the WTO\u0092 s Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures in the wider context of WTO multilateral or plurilateral negotiations (see Bown and Hillman, 2019), Zhou and Fang (2021) argue that these reforms are not necessary to address the China-speci c issues that arise in the context of subsidy disciplines and that such reforms would be better approached outside the context of China-speci c trade tensions. 133emerged in China\u0092 s market access rights and obligations and that have led to the growing frustrations of industrialized countries with China, Inc. By channeling these frustrations into non-violation claims, where such claims might perhaps be aided by China itself and where the process of ling and resolving these claims might also serve as a mechanism for resolving among the parties any pending or imminent violation claims, the existing GATT/WTO procedures for dispute settlement can be most e\u00a4ectively put to use. Finally, an added bene t of addressing this issue with non-violation claims is that it helps to draw a clean distinction between concerns over non-reciprocity with China on the one hand, and the possibility that even with reciprocity es- tablished a WTO member might wish to rethink its own level of market access commitments on the other; and it allows these two separable issues to be ad- dressed on separate tracks. As I describe next, the second issue is best addressed within the context of Article XXVIII renegotiations. And the separation of these two issues is crucial, because while the maintenance of reciprocity should be a central concern of attempts to address the second issue (and would be under Ar- ticle XXVIII renegotiations), by design it cannot be a feature of the solution to the rst issue (and would not be under a non-violation claim, where the whole point is to address an imbalance and thereby restore reciprocity). 7.2. Reconsideration of the level of market access commitments Suppose that the imbalance between China\u0092 s market access rights and obligations in the WTO can be addressed, and that reciprocity is restored in the world trading system. Does this mean that all of the major challenges to the world trading system presented by the rise of the large emerging markets will have been met? In this and the next subsection I suggest that the answer to this question is \u0093No,\u0094 by describing two additional challenges that would still remain. A rst challenge relates to the impact on industrialized country income inequality that the rise of large emerging markets has had. Whether this impact would be mitigated or rather exacerbated by the restoration of reciprocity with China depends in part on how reciprocity is restored; and in particular this depends on whether reciprocity with China is restored by an expansion of access to the markets of China, or rather by a reduction in access to the markets of the industrialized world. I discuss this challenge in this subsection. A second challenge relates to the history of reciprocal tari\u00a4 negotiations in GATT, the historical lack of participation by nonindustrialized countries in these negotiations, and how that 134history has positioned the world trading system going forward in the presence of the large emerging markets today. I discuss this challenge in the next subsection. Concerns about the possible adverse e\u00a4ects of trade on income inequality are not new, and indeed such e\u00a4ects are central predictions of the standard neoclassi- cal models of trade. But as of the mid 1990\u0092 s the general view among economists was that as an empirical matter the distributional impacts of trade were relatively modest. Today that view is markedly less sanguine, thanks in part to changes in the nature and scale of trade over the past three decades \u0096including a dramatic rise in the manufacturing exports of developing and emerging economies \u0096 and thanks in part also to changes in the focus of the economics research investigating these e\u00a4ects (a shift in focus from economy-wide impacts to local labor market e\u00a4ects).87This observation is especially illuminating for the current discussion, because the WTO tari\u00a4 commitments in place today are the product of multi- lateral market access negotiations in the Uruguay Round that were completed in 1994 with the signing of the Marrakesh Agreement that created the WTO. In this light, there is a possibility that the Uruguay Round tari\u00a4 commitments made by some industrialized countries now imply the grant of a greater level of market ac- cess than these countries are comfortable with given the level of income inequality that they are now grappling with.88 In short, it would not be unreasonable if those industrialized countries that have experienced a signi cant increase in income inequality over the past several decades now wanted to pause and reconsider some of their existing tari\u00a4 com- mitments, given that these commitments were made before the rise of the large emerging markets at a time when it was thought that the potential for trade to generate signi cant income inequality issues within industrialized countries was small. Of course, a convincing argument that the reimposition of tari\u00a4s is an appropriate response to a country\u0092 s concerns about income inequality would have to clear several important hurdles. A rst hurdle is to demonstrate that there are not alternative policy responses that are available to the government and that could address its concerns about income inequality at lower overall cost to the economy. At a general level, the 87See Krugman (2019) for a nice summary of the evolution of economists\u0092thinking on the link between trade and income inequality. The local labor market impacts of trade competition were rst considered by Borjas and Ramey (1995); Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2013) were the rst to investigate the regional/local labor market impacts of trade with China. 88Not all countries experienced rising income inequality over this period. See Bourguignon (2019) on the cross-country diversity of trends in income inequality over the past 30 years. 135targeting principle (Bhagwati and Ramaswami, 1963) implies that tari\u00a4s will al- most never be the rst-best policy choice for achieving any particular goal (the exception, as noted in chapter 6, being for purposes of terms-of-trade manipula- tion, a consideration which should play no role in clearing this rst hurdle). For example, at least for those countries that have the means to nance them, the use of production subsidies would typically dominate tari\u00a4s as a policy tool for addressing concerns about income inequality.89But as I noted in chapter 2, in the real world such policies may not, in fact, be widely available to all countries. Indeed, this may be true even for rich countries: for example, after describing the labor market policies and programs that are available in the United States, Kletzer (2019, p 171) concludes that \u0093Despite the array of US programs, there is considerable evidence that these labor market interventions are inadequate.\u009490 A second hurdle is to demonstrate that the proposed tari\u00a4 increases would actually have the intended e\u00a4ect on income inequality. This demonstration is complicated by the fact that technology as well as factor endowments within the industrialized countries have changed dramatically over the period that income inequality has risen, and it is therefore almost certainly true that \u0093turning back the clock\u0094with tari\u00a4s to achieve the trade patterns and volumes that a country experienced in an earlier time would not bring back the income distribution that the country had experienced at that time. Notice, though, that the e\u00a4ectiveness of tari\u00a4s as a response to rising income inequality in a country does not hinge on whether trade has caused the rise in inequality; rather it is simply a question of whether the use of tari\u00a4s \u0096and the price e\u00a4ects that their use would generate in the country \u0096might be part of the optimal response to addressing inequality, whatever its causes, given the technologies and factor endowments that exist today.91 89In this regard, the WTO\u0092 s Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement), which regulates the use of subsidies relating to trade in goods, includes a provision (Article 8.2(b)) that identi es assistance to disadvantaged regions as \u0093non-actionable,\u0094granting WTO member governments wide latitude to implement the kinds of subsidies that might be called for in addressing income inequality related to the local labor market e\u00a4ects of trade. However, this provision was temporary, and it was allowed to lapse at the end of 1999. Reforming the SCM Agreement to reinstate Article 8 in some form would help to remove WTO legal barriers that could have the e\u00a4ect of precluding the use of subsidies over tari\u00a4s for purposes of addressing income inequality concerns, and on these general grounds would be supported by the targeting- principle logic. See, for example, Charnovitz (2014), who makes similar arguments for the reinstatement of Article 8 in some form as that article relates to environmental subsidies. 90That said, it should be noted that Kletzer (2019) advocates for implementing a program of wage insurance in the United States, not the use of tari\u00a4s. 91I am abstracting from the dynamic e\u00a4ects of tari\u00a4s on technologies and factor supplies. 136Where does this discussion leave us? The reimposition of tari\u00a4s surely cannot be the centerpiece of an appropriate response to concerns about income inequal- ity. But in light of the complexity of the issues involved and the evident lack of rst-best policy instruments to address these issues, neither does there appear to be a compelling reason that tari\u00a4 responses \u0096above all other possible second-best policy responses \u0096should be taken o\u00a4 the table. In the abstract, a sensible posi- tion might therefore be that industrialized countries that have experienced rising income inequality and have concerns about this development should be able to reconsider some of their Uruguay Round tari\u00a4 commitments as part of a broader package of policy interventions to address these concerns. How would the restoration of reciprocity between China and its industrialized trading partners impact these considerations? As I mentioned above, that would depend in part on how reciprocity is restored. If reciprocity with China is restored as a result of a reduction in access to the markets of the industrialized world, then this implies that some industrialized-country tari\u00a4s would rise, and these tari\u00a4 increases might be structured so as to mitigate income inequality concerns in industrialized countries. On the other hand, if reciprocity with China is restored as a result of an expansion of access to the markets of China, then this implies that China would be liberalizing its import regime which, if this does not impact China\u0092 s overall trade imbalance, implies that China will also be exporting more, a scenario that is likely to exacerbate the existing income inequality concerns of industrialized countries.92The upshot is that restoring reciprocity between China and its industrialized trading partners is unlikely to address existing concerns over income inequality, and might even exacerbate these concerns. This brings me to the possibility of Article XXVIII renegotiations. Speci cally, while I argued above that the non-violation clause is well-designed to deal with concerns over non-reciprocity with China, I now argue that Article XXVIII is There is also the deeper question whether income inequality as typically measured, or rather broader measures of economic inequality such as inequality in job tenure prospects and the prospects for one\u0092 s children, should be the target of policy interventions, and how trade policy interventions would measure up to other available policy responses with such targets in mind. See Bourguignon (2019) for an illuminating discussion of these issues. 92Absent any impact on its overall trade imbalance, and holding its terms-of-trade xed, China\u0092 s unilateral import liberalization would lead to equivalent increases in its exports; and if China is large in the import markets where it liberalizes, then its terms of trade should dete- riorate, implying an even larger increase in its exports to maintain its existing trade balance. Of course, if China were to make policy changes that altered its overall trade balance, addi- tional considerations would come into play. Krugman (2019) provides a recent discussion of the potentially important impact of trade imbalances on U.S. income inequality in the short run. 137well-designed to deal with the possibility that, even with reciprocity established, a WTO member might wish to rethink its own level of market access commitments. Hoda (2001) describes the mechanics of Article XXVIII renegotiations in de- tail, and provides a comprehensive history of the hundreds of renegotiations that have occurred over the GATT and early WTO years. In brief, countries do not need to provide a rationale to initiate renegotiations under Article XXVIII, but simply need to follow the procedures for renegotiation laid out in Article XXVIII. As Hoda (2001) explains, the key features of Article XXVIII renegotiations are that a country is allowed to modify or withdraw the tari\u00a4 commitments that are the subject of its renegotiations, even if it cannot (within de ned time limits) reach agreement in those negotiations with its impacted trading partners; and that its impacted trading partners are then allowed to respond \u0096at most \u0096in a reciprocal manner by withdrawing \u0093substantially equivalent\u0094tari\u00a4 commitments of their own, where any disagreements over what constitutes substantially equiva- lent tari\u00a4commitments are subject to rulings of the relevant GATT/WTO dispute settlement bodies. In this way, with reciprocal actions de ning the disagreement or \u0093threat\u0094point to the negotiations, Article XXVIII renegotiations avoid the pos- sibility that a threatened or actual breakdown in those negotiations could hold up the modi cations that a country desires to make to its tari\u00a4 commitments. At the same time these renegotiations imply that the original balance of negoti- ated reciprocal tari\u00a4 commitments between the country and its trading partners is preserved; this last feature is important, because as discussed in chapter 4, the application of reciprocity that delivers it ensures that ine\u00a2 cient terms-of-trade motives are removed from the country\u0092 s incentives to initiate the renegotiation.93 These features of Article XXVIII are the reason that legal scholars claim that GATT/WTO tari\u00a4 commitments are designed to operate as \u0093liability rules.\u0094For example, as I noted in chapter 6, Pauwelyn (2008) distinguishes between GATT Articles that are designed as liability rules and others that are designed as prop- erty rules, and he designates tari\u00a4 commitments as liability rules on the basis of the renegotiation opportunities provided by Article XXVIII (as well as other similar but temporary escapes such as the GATT Safeguard clause Article XIX). In explaining the logic of this design, Pauwelyn (2008, p 137) writes: . . . trade negotiators cannot foresee all possible situations, nor can they predict future economic and political developments, both at home and in- ternationally. As a result of this uncertainty, they wanted the \u0087 exibility of 93Bagwell and Staiger (1999, 2002) emphasize these incentive e\u00a4ects of reciprocity. 138a liability rule. An important bene t of a liability rule is that it can allow for \u0093e\u00a2 cient breach.\u0094 Schwartz and Sykes (2002, p S181) put the point this way: Economic theory teaches that a key objective of an enforcement system is to induce a party to comply with its obligations whenever compliance will yield greater bene ts to the promisee than costs to the promisor, while allowing the promisor to depart from its obligations whenever the costs of compliance to the promisor exceed the bene ts to the promisee. In the parlance of contract theory, the objective is to deter ine\u00a2 cient breaches but to encourage e\u00a2 cient ones. It is exactly in the spirit of e\u00a2 cient breach that limited use of Article XXVIII renegotiations might be made by those industrialized countries that are concerned about rising inequality and wish to reconsider some of their Uruguay Round tari\u00a4 commitments as part of a broader package of policy interventions to address these concerns. Importantly, under the rules of Article XXVIII, those countries would not be making this choice \u0093for free.\u0094Rather, they would be making this choice with the knowledge that any modi cation or withdrawal of tari\u00a4 commitments would be met with reciprocal withdrawals of market access by their e\u00a4ected trading partners; and if a country still prefers to raise its tari\u00a4s under these conditions, then that is how the GATT renegotiation process approximates e\u00a2 cient breach.94 It is also instructive to consider what can happen in a renegotiation of trade commitments that are not designed to operate as liability rules. Although it is not directly comparable to the Article XXVIII renegotiation of a GATT tari\u00a4 commitment, the Brexit negotiations for the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union provide something of a cautionary tale. These negotia- tions, which had no meaningful equivalent to the reciprocity \u0093buy out\u0094provision of GATT\u0092 s Article XXVIII that could have acted as a threat point for the outcome of the negotiations, o\u00a2 cially began on March 29 2017 when the United Kingdom activated its withdrawal notice under Article 50of the Treaty on European Union, and the negotiations were concluded in October of 2019. As is well known, the initial two-year negotiation period had to be extended in order that an agreement on the terms of withdrawal could be reached, and the negotiations were fraught 94Maggi and Staiger (2015) provide a formal rationale for the e\u00a2 cient-breach role that the reciprocity rule can play in a model where international transfers are costly. 139with seemingly ample room for strategic behavior.95The liability-rule structure of GATT Article XXVIII renegotiations acts as an insurance policy against the possibility that such renegotiations would devolve into a Brexit-like situation.96 7.3. The latecomers problem I began this chapter by noting that there are three interrelated challenges for the world trading system created by the rise in economic importance of the large emerging and developing economies. The rst of the challenges that I described centers on China. And owing to its sheer size in world trade, China undoubtedly plays a leading role in the second challenge that I described as well. The third challenge that I now describe is due to an asymmetry in the level of market access commitments between the developing/emerging economies and the industrialized countries. This asymmetry arose as a result of the historical lack of participation of non-industrialized countries in 50years of GATT recipro- cal tari\u00a4 negotiations, and it has led to what Bagwell and Staiger (2014) call a \u0093latecomers problem\u0094for the WTO which may be hindering the ability of many developing and emerging economies to gain from GATT/WTO membership. Be- cause China made more signi cant (though, as it turned out, still not reciprocal) market access concessions as part of its 2001 protocol for accession to the WTO than have any other emerging and developing economy WTO members to date, this third challenge is less about China than about other emerging and developing economies.97Following Bagwell and Staiger, I now brie\u0087 y describe the latecomers problem and how it might be addressed with GATT Article XXVIII renegotia- tions between industrialized countries followed by Article XXVIII bis negotiations between industrialized and developing/emerging countries.98 95See, for example, Martill and Staiger (2014) on the bargaining strategy pursued by the UK in its Brexit negotiations. 96If \u0087 exibility in market access commitments is valued, this comparison also illustrates an advantage of GATT\u0092 s shallow integration approach. It is di\u00a2 cult to see how a liability-rule approach to market access commitments could be possible with a deep-integration agreement such as the European Union. On the other hand, if \u0087 exibility is not valued, as would be the case under the commitment theory of trade agreements (see note 9), then the fact that this possibility arises under shallow integration is not an attractive feature of the GATT/WTO approach. 97On the unusually far-reaching market access commitments that China agreed to in its pro- tocol of accession to the WTO relative to other developing and emerging economy GATT/WTO members, see for example, Lardy (2001). 98In chapter 8 I will consider an additional, possibly complementary, way of addressing the latecomers problem within the context of climate policy. 140Recall from chapter 4 that, according to the terms-of-trade theory, negotiations that abide by MFN and reciprocity can eliminate third-party spillovers from bi- lateral tari\u00a4 bargaining. As I described in that chapter, this feature underpins the e\u00a2 ciency properties of a tari\u00a4 negotiating forum such as GATT that relies heavily on bilateral tari\u00a4 bargaining and is built on the pillars of MFN and reciprocity. But historically GATT has extended to its developing country members an exception to the reciprocity norm, codi ed under \u0093special and di\u00a4erential treat- ment,\u0094or SDT, clauses. These clauses were intended to provide developing coun- tries with a \u0093free pass\u0094on the MFN tari\u00a4 cuts that the developed countries ne- gotiated with one another, and in this way to allow developing country exporters to then share with exporters from developed countries in the bene ts of greater MFN access to developed country markets. As Bagwell and Staiger (2014) point out, however, in the presence of SDT the fact that third-party spillovers from bilateral tari\u00a4 bargaining are neutralized when those bargains abide by MFN and reciprocity now carries with it a more negative connotation: it implies that, by design, these SDT clauses cannot suc- ceed at their intended purpose. This is because, as I described in the context of the three-country two-good general equilibrium model of chapter 4, when two (developed) countries engage in a bilateral tari\u00a4 negotiation that abides by MFN and reciprocity while the third (developing) country sits it out, the third country gets nothing from their negotiations. Indeed, a wide range of anecdotal and empirical evidence suggests that devel- oping countries have gained little from more than half a century of GATT/WTO- sponsored tari\u00a4 negotiations. For example, based on interviews with WTO dele- gates and Secretariat sta\u00a4 members, Jawara and Kwa (2003, p. 269) conclude: Developed countries are bene tting from the WTO, as are a handful of (mostly upper) middle-income countries. The rest, including the great ma- jority of developing countries, are not. It is as simple as that. In an implicit acknowledgement of this fact, the WTO\u0092 s Doha Round is semi- o\u00a2 cially known as the Doha Development Agenda, because a fundamental ob- jective of the Round is to improve the trading prospects of developing countries. But as the declaration from the WTO Ministerial Conference in Doha, Qatar, November 14, 2001, states in part: We agree that special and di\u00a4erential treatment for developing countries shall be an integral part of all elements of the negotiations... . 141Ironically, as Bagwell and Staiger (2014) observe, according to the terms-of-trade theory it is the GATT/WTO\u0092 s embrace of SDT that explains the disappointing developing country experience with GATT/WTO membership to begin with; and this suggests that the Doha Round cannot succeed in one of its fundamental objectives under the current bargaining protocol that it has adopted. Even if one accepts the diagnosis of the problem o\u00a4ered by the terms-of-trade theory, simply abandoning SDT at this point and bringing the developing and emerging market countries to the tari\u00a4 bargaining table is unlikely to be su\u00a2 cient to address the issue, and this is where the latecomers problem becomes relevant for the Doha Round: because they are \u0093latecomers\u0094to the bargaining table relative to the industrialized countries, developing and emerging market countries are unlikely to nd industrialized-country bargaining partners that can reciprocate the substantial tari\u00a4 cuts that they might have to o\u00a4er.99This kind of asymmetry is at the heart of various diagnoses of the central sticking points at Doha, such as this diagnosis from The Economist (April 28, 2011): ...the real bone of contention is the aim of proposed cuts in tari\u00a4s on man- ufactured goods. America sees the Doha talks as its nal opportunity to get fast-growing emerging economies like China and India to slash their du- ties on imports of such goods, which have been reduced in previous rounds but remain much higher than those in the rich world. It wants something approaching parity, at least in some sectors, because it reckons its own low tari\u00a4s leave it with few concessions to o\u00a4er in future talks. But emerging markets insist that the Doha round was never intended to result in such harmonization. These positions are fundamentally at odds. In some sense, then, the industrialized countries nd themselves in a position in the Doha Round not unlike the position that the United States tried very hard to avoid in the context of sequential bilateral tari\u00a4 bargaining under the 1934 RTAA as described in chapter 2: new potential bargaining partners have arrived, but due to previous tari\u00a4 bargains with each other the industrialized countries have not preserved su\u00a2 cient bargaining power to engage in a substantial way with these 99If the arrival of the developing and emerging economies had been anticipated by the industri- alized countries at the time that the latter were engaged in tari\u00a4 negotiations, then the ndings of Bagwell and Staiger (2010b) on bilateral sequential tari\u00a4 in a GATT/WTO-like bargaining forum as an e\u00a2 cient means of accommodating new countries into the world trading system might apply. But it is the unanticipated arrival of the \u0093latecomers\u0094that makes achieving e\u00a2 cient tari\u00a4 bargaining outcomes in the GATT/WTO framework more di\u00a2 cult. 142new potential partners. Mattoo and Staiger (2020) argue that the latecomers problem and its implications for the preservation of tari\u00a4 bargaining power in the WTO system may be helpful for interpreting recent United States trade actions as signifying a switch from \u0093rules-based\u0094 to \u0093power-based\u0094 tari\u00a4 bargaining. I discussed some of these points at the end of chapter 5, and I discuss Mattoo and Staiger further in chapter 12. Here I argue that existing GATT/WTO \u0087 exibilities can be used to address the latecomers problem within the rules-based system. The essential idea is to nd a way to implement the set of tari\u00a4 commitments that the current WTO membership would choose to negotiate if countries were not constrained in their negotiations by their pre-existing tari\u00a4 bindings. This means providing countries with the \u0087 exibility to rst escape from their existing GATT/WTO tari\u00a4 bindings in an orderly way when necessary, so that they can then engage in reciprocal MFN tari\u00a4 bargaining with all willing WTO-member bargaining partners. As Bagwell and Staiger (2014) note, there are obvious dan- gers in encouraging such \u0087 exibility for this rst step, and su\u00a2 cient care would need to be taken to prevent uncontrolled unraveling of existing tari\u00a4 commit- ments. That said, the \u0087 exibility needed for the rst step is already provided in GATT via the Article XXVIII renegotiation provisions that I discussed in detail earlier in this chapter (i.e., industrialized countries could renegotiate in an upward direction some of the bindings to which they had previously agreed in negotia- tions with other industrialized countries), while the \u0087 exibility for the second step is provided by the standard bilateral tari\u00a4 bargaining protocols that have been employed in the various GATT rounds under Article XXVIII bis and that I de- scribed in chapter 4 (i.e., these industrialized countries could then engage in a round of reciprocal tari\u00a4 bargaining with the \u0093latecomer\u0094emerging and develop- ing countries). So at least in principle, the WTO has the design features that would allow its member governments to address the latecomers problem. But a necessary ingredient for success would be to revisit the commitment to SDT.100 100In note 96 I observed that an advantage of shallow integration is that it can facilitate a liability-rule approach to market access commitments that allows for \u0087 exibilities that would be di\u00a2 cult under deep integration. A related observation can be made here, namely, that it would be easier to address the latecomers problem and associated challenges created by a rising WTO membership and growing importance of developing and emerging economies within the membership when a shallow approach to integration is adopted than when deep integration is attempted. With shallow integration, what is at issue are tari\u00a4 renegotiations and further negotiations to adjust market access commitments for member governments in the face of a changing membership. With deep integration, the task would likely be much more complicated, as the increasing membership would have to agree on which deep commitments are acceptable. 1438. Climate Change101 There is little doubt that crafting an e\u00a4ective policy response to the changes in global climate that are resulting from rising levels of atmospheric carbon will be a de ning challenge for the twenty- rst century. The existential threats to the planet from a failure to rise to this challenge are by now well documented.102 The WTO and the world trading system that it governs will by necessity play a role in meeting this challenge. The only question is whether the WTO\u0092 s role will be seen as obstructionist, or rather whether it can be accommodating to the world\u0092 s attempts to solve the problem of climate change or even serve as an active contributor to the solution. For example, Mattoo and Subramanian (2014, p 91) describe the relationship between climate policy and trade policy in these terms: If countries cut emissions by di\u00a4erent amounts, or impose carbon taxes at di\u00a4erent levels, then carbon prices are likely to di\u00a4er across countries. Countries with higher carbon prices may seek to impose additional border taxes on imports from countries with lower carbon prices in order to o\u00a4set the competitive disadvantage to their rms and to prevent \u0093leakage,\u0094 an increase of carbon emissions in the form of increased production in countries with lower carbon prices. ... A key issue, therefore, is the scope for trade policy actions in any climate change agreement. ... In e\u00a4ect, as Mattoo and Subramanian note, the kinds of carbon policies required to address global climate change are likely to have important trade e\u00a4ects and lead to policy disputes that the WTO may be called upon to adjudicate. And more recently, Nordhaus (2015) has called for the creation of a \u0093Climate Club\u0094in which member-countries agree to reduce their carbon emissions and nonparticipants are penalized with tari\u00a4s imposed on them by the club members. In this chapter I discuss some of the key issues faced by the WTO in accommo- dating e\u00a4orts to address climate change, and the constructive role that the WTO might play in addressing this challenge. To aid in this discussion, I develop a simple two-country partial equilibrium model of trade that features both a \u0093trade problem\u0094 (associated with the terms-of-trade externality) with a global non-pecuniary externality from carbon emissions) 101This chapter draws on material from my 2018 Frank D. Graham Memorial Lecture. 102See, for example, Wallace-Wells (2019), or any of the recent Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, available at https://www.ipcc.ch/reports/. 144for the world to solve. The model is intentionally simplistic, as my emphasis is on broad themes rather than speci c details. I begin by considering how the GATT/WTO architecture can continue to work to address the trade problem in this setting. I then turn to the issue of carbon border adjustments, and ask what role such adjustments might play in maintaining the solution to the trade problem under the GATT/WTO architec- ture while accommodating implementation of the carbon taxes that would result from the successful negotiation of a global climate accord. Finally, I discuss a more active role that the WTO might play in addressing the challenge of climate change through a form of linkage between the WTO and the negotiated policy commitments of a climate accord. 8.1. Climate policy and trade agreements How does the GATT/WTO architecture work when there is both a trade problem and a climate problem to solve? I now describe a simple model to provide answers that can illuminate a number of the dimensions to this question. A benchmark trade-and-carbon model I consider a partial equilibrium two- country model of trade in a carbon-intensive good, which to x ideas might be thought of as aluminum. I denote by cthe reduction in per-capita welfare every- where in the world from the carbon emitted by another unit of aluminum produc- tion in the home country; and similarly I denote by c\u0003the reduction in per-capita welfare everywhere in the world from the carbon emitted by another unit of alu- minum production in the foreign country. The parameters c>0andc\u0003>0can be thought of as the carbon content of production in the home and the foreign country, measured in welfare (numeraire) units. If c6=c\u0003, then the carbon content of production di\u00a4ers across home and foreign producers.103 The home (importing) country is populated by Lcitizens, and the home gov- ernment can impose a production tax ton its producers and an import tari\u00a4 ; and similarly, the foreign (exporting) country is populated by L\u0003citizens, and the foreign government can impose a production tax t\u0003on its producers and an export tari\u00a4 \u0003. All taxes/tari\u00a4s are expressed in speci c terms, and negative taxes/tari\u00a4s 103The assumption that carbon emissions impact the welfare of both countries uniformly is made for simplicity, so that I can focus on di\u00a4erences across countries in the carbon content of their production. But at the cost of more notation, it is straightforward to show that the results I emphasize below do not depend on this assumption. 145correspond to subsidies. Notice that, given my assumptions, the home-country production tax tcould equivalently be implemented as a carbon taxt con home- country producers, while the foreign-country production tax t\u0003could equivalently be implemented as a carbon taxt\u0003 c\u0003on foreign-country producers; and it could then be said that the home country \u0093has a higher carbon price\u0094than the foreign country whent c>t\u0003 c\u0003. In what follows, I will for convenience characterize policies in terms of tari\u00a4s and production taxes, but I will sometimes also make reference to the carbon taxes implied by the production taxes. Home producers face producer prices qand the upward-sloping home supply curve isS(q), while home consumers face the consumer price pwithp=q+tand have downward sloping demand D(p). The analogous prices and magnitudes in the foreign country are q\u0003,p\u0003,S\u0003(q\u0003)andD\u0003(p\u0003), withp\u0003=q\u0003+t\u0003. With strictly positive imports (which I assume is always the case), the arbitrage condition impliesp\u0003=p\u0000 \u0000 \u0003, and the world price can be de ned in standard fashion as pw\u0011p\u0000 or, equivalently by the arbitrage condition, pw\u0011p\u0003+ \u0003. Finally, with home imports de ned by M\u0011D\u0000Sand foreign exports de ned by E\u0003\u0011S\u0003\u0000D\u0003, the market clearing condition equating home imports to foreign exports, D(pw+ )\u0000S(pw+ \u0000t) =S\u0003(pw\u0000 \u0003\u0000t\u0003)\u0000D\u0003(pw\u0000 \u0003); de nes the equilibrium price as a function of policies, ~pw( ;t; \u0003;t\u0003), from which each of the other equilibrium prices may then also be derived using the pricing relationships above: ~p( + is standard, the world price depends on the levels of each of the tari\u00a4s and \u0003(as well as each of the production taxes tandt\u0003), but re\u0087 ected in (8.1) is the property that only the sum of the tari\u00a4s + \u0003enters into the home and foreign consumer and producer prices (in addition to tandt\u0003). I de ne welfare in the home country Was a weighted sum of consumer surplus (CS), producer surplus ( PS) and net tax revenue ( REV\u0011 M+tS) minus the welfare cost of world carbon emissions on home citizens ( L\u0002[cS+c\u0003S\u0003]), with a weight\u0010\u00151placed on home producer The producer price of each country\u0092 s trading partner enters the country\u0092 s welfare function as a result of the world-wide carbon (non-pecuniary) externality re\u0087 ected inc >0andc\u0003>0. The weights on producer surplus \u0010and\u0010\u0003are meant to capture both distributional/political economy concerns associated with the pro- duction of carbon-intensive goods, as well as possible development opportunities not captured by the model that relate to the use of carbon-intensive technologies and may di\u00a4er across countries in light of di\u00a4erent stages of development (see, e.g., Mattoo and Subramanian, 2014). As will become clear just below, it is these considerations that account for the possibility that e\u00a2 cient carbon taxes in this setting need not be uniform across countries as they would be under the classic Samuelson (1954) public goods optimality condition (see, e.g., Weizman, 2014). Nash ine\u00a2 ciencies in a world of trade and climate problems I de ne e\u00a2 cient policies as those that maximize the sum of home and foreign (\u0093world\u0094 ) welfare.104Straightforward calculations con rm eand \u0003eand production taxes teandt\u0003ein elasticity of in the home country and \u0011S\u0003 is the producer-price elasticity of supply in the foreign country, and where a su- perscriptedenotes evaluation of the magnitude at e\u00a2 cient policies. As expected, the rst line of (8.4) con rms that there is no e\u00a2 ciency role for tari\u00a4s, and that only their sum is relevant for determining e\u00a2 ciency. The second line shows that, when the weights \u0010and\u0010\u0003on producer surplus are both equal to one, the e\u00a2 - cient carbon taxes (te cfor the home country,t\u0003e c\u0003for the foreign country) will be 104I am thereby implicitly assuming here that lump-sum transfers are available to distribute surplus across the two countries as desired. In the present setting lump-sum transfers can be e\u00a4ected by altering and \u0003while leaving their sum unchanged. 147uniform across countries and set at the Pigouvian level (L+L\u0003)that internalizes the world-wide carbon externality; but if there are distributional/development concerns associated with carbon-intensive production so that these weights are greater than one, then there is an o\u00a4setting force that pushes toward subsidizing production and that is inversely related to the elasticity of supply. Turning to non-cooperative policies, the rst-order conditions that de ne the best-response tari\u00a4 and production tax policies for the home and foreign govern- ments can be manipulated to yield the following import demand (de ned positively) and \u0011E\u0003is the world-price elasticity of foreign-country export supply, and where a superscript Ndenotes evaluation of the magnitude at Nash poli- cies. As the second line of (8.5) implies, in the Nash equilibrium each country ignores the impact of its carbon emissions on the welfare of the other country\u0092 s citizens when choosing its production tax (that is, the home country ignores L\u0003c when choosing its production tax, and the foreign country ignores Lc\u0003). And as a comparison with the second line of (8.4) reveals, this tends to make each coun- try\u0092 s Nash production taxes too low and its carbon emissions too high relative to e\u00a2 cient levels. The expressions in the rst lines of (8.5) then reveal that the Nash tari\u00a4s deviate from zero for two reasons: the rst term in each expression compensates for the fact that the trading partner\u0092 s production tax is too low, and employs the tari\u00a4 as an instrument to reduce the trading partner\u0092 s produc- tion and hence carbon emissions, modulated by the relevant elasticities; and the second terms in each expression correspond to the familiar Johnson (1953-54) terms-of-trade-manipulation motive. To understand further the nature of the tari\u00a4 ine\u00a2 ciencies in the Nash equi- librium, it is illuminating to consider the tari\u00a4s that would be e\u00a2 cient conditional on the level of the Nash production taxes, tNandt\u0003N, characterized in (8.5). Re- calling that only the sum of tari\u00a4s is relevant for e\u00a2 ciency (i.e., world welfare) considerations, the tari\u00a4s that maximize world welfare conditional on the level of 148the Nash production taxes characterized in (8.5) magnitudes on the right-hand side of (8.6) are evaluated at the Nash production taxes tNandt\u0003Nand the tari\u00a4s e(tN;t\u0003N)and \u0003e(tN;t\u0003N). Notice that, according to (8.6), e(tN;t\u0003N) + \u0003e(tN;t\u0003N)could be either positive (a net tax on trade) or negative (a net subsidy to trade). Comparing (8.6) to the sum of the Nash tari\u00a4s characterized in the rst line of (8.5), what is missing from e(tN;t\u0003N) + \u0003e(tN;t\u0003N)is the second term in each Nash tari\u00a4 expression, namely, the terms-of-trade-manipulation motive that makes each country\u0092 s Nash tari\u00a4 higher than it would otherwise be. Evidently, the rst term in each of the Nash tari\u00a4 expressions, which re\u0087 ects the attempt of each country to use its tari\u00a4to compensate for the ine\u00a2 ciently low production tax of its trading partner, remains present for the e\u00a2 cient use of tari\u00a4s conditional on Nash production taxes. Intuitively, as the expression on the right-hand side of (8.6) re\u0087 ects, controlling for the relevant elasticity considerations it is e\u00a2 cient to use tari\u00a4s to shift carbon-intensive production to the country whose Nash production taxes are closest to the e\u00a2 cient level, which according to the second lines in (8.4) and (8.5) will be the home country when L\u0003c < Lc\u0003(and therefore a net tax on trade) and the foreign country (and therefore a net subsidy to trade) otherwise. The upshot is that the nature of the Nash ine\u00a2 ciencies in the absence of trade and climate agreements can be described in simple terms. Carbon taxes are too low, re\u0087 ecting the presence of an international non-pecuniary externality (a climate problem). And conditional on Nash carbon taxes, tari\u00a4s are too high, re\u0087 ecting the presence of an international pecuniary externality (a trade problem). A shallow integration approach to the trade problem To see whether GATT\u0092 s shallow-integration approach could still solve the trade problem in a world where, as depicted above, the trade problem coexists with the climate problem, I begin from the Nash tari\u00a4s and production taxes characterized in (8.5) and sup- pose that countries negotiate over tari\u00a4s, with the understanding that (i) if either country subsequently makes a unilateral policy adjustment that has the e\u00a4ect of withdrawing market access, then its trading partner will withdraw equivalent mar- ket access in a reciprocal fashion, but that (ii) unilateral policy adjustments that leave market access unchanged will trigger no response from the trading partner. 149Recalling from chapter 4 (see also note 38) that a reciprocal withdrawal of market access will hold xed the terms of trade ~pwbetween the home and foreign country and that unilateral policy adjustments that leave market access unchanged will hold xed ~pwas well, the unilateral policy options open to each country subse- quent to their tari\u00a4 negotiations amount to policy adjustments that may or may not decrease the level of market access implied by their tari\u00a4 commitments but that in any case do not alter the terms of trade ~pw.105In e\u00a4ect, the understanding in (i) can be thought of as re\u0087 ecting in a shorthand way the reciprocity provisions of GATT Article XXVIII discussed in previous chapters, while the understanding in (ii) can be thought of as re\u0087 ecting GATT\u0092 s \u0093market access preservation rules.\u0094 Can tari\u00a4 negotiations solve the trade problem under this representation of GATT\u0092 s shallow integration approach? As I now demonstrate, the answer is \u0093Yes.\u0094To see this, suppose that in their tari\u00a4 negotiations the home and foreign countries agree to the tari\u00a4 levels \u0016 and\u0016 magnitudes on the right-hand side of (8.7) are evaluated at the Nash carbon taxes tNandt\u0003Nand the tari\u00a4s \u0016 and\u0016 \u0003. Notice from (8.7) that the home country is agreeing to an import tari\u00a4 while the foreign country is agreeing to an export subsidy. And notice from (8.6) and the de nitions of \u0016 and\u0016 e(tN;t\u0003N) + \u0003e(tN;t\u0003N), implying that the two countries have agreed to tari\u00a4s that are e\u00a2 cient given Nash production taxes. The question is then whether subsequent to the negotiations the tari\u00a4s will remain at the levels \u0016 and\u0016 \u0003and the production taxes at the levels tNandt\u0003Nunder GATT\u0092 s shallow integration rules as I have modeled them. If so, then we may conclude that GATT\u0092 s shallow integration approach can solve the trade problem, leaving the climate problem una\u00a4ected (and presumably to be solved by other means).106 Consider rst the policy options described in (i) above. Focusing on the home country, it is direct to con rm using (8.2) that, evaluated at the Nash production taxestNandt\u0003Nand the tari\u00a4s \u0016 and\u0016 \u0003, 105On the formal relationship between reciprocity and terms-of-trade movements in a partial equilibrium setting such as the one I describe here, see Bagwell and Staiger (2001a, note 19). 106In saying that the climate problem will be left \u0093una\u00a4ected,\u0094I simply mean that it will still be the case that carbon taxes are too low, re\u0087 ecting the presence of an international non-pecuniary externality (a climate problem), with no new (e.g., terms-of-trade manipulation) sources of policy distortions in carbon taxes. 150dW d +dW d \u0003d \u0003 d jdepw=0= 0; implying that the home country can do no better than to select \u0016 in light of the reciprocal response from the foreign country that an increase in its tari\u00a4 would trigger. And again evaluated at the Nash production taxes tNandt\u0003Nand the tari\u00a4s \u0016 and\u0016 \u0003, it is also dW dt+dW d \u0003d \u0003 dtjdepw=0= 0; implying that the home country can do no better than to select tNin light of the reciprocal response from the foreign country that a decrease in its production tax would trigger. Finally, consider the policy options described in (ii) above. At Nash production taxes tNandt\u0003Nand the tari\u00a4s \u0016 and\u0016 d d dtjdepw=0= 0; implying that there is no mix of policies that the home country would prefer over \u0016 andtNthat could deliver its negotiated level of market access. Completely analogous statements can be shown to hold for the foreign country using (8.3). Hence, GATT\u0092 s shallow-integration approach can solve the trade problem in a world where that problem coexists with the climate problem. And what is left is a climate problem, where carbon taxes are ine\u00a2 ciently low, but where the ine\u00a2 ciency is due only to an international non-pecuniary externality. 8.2. Carbon border adjustments Suppose that countries are able to nd a way to negotiate an enforceable climate accord and implement the increase in production (carbon) taxes that would be needed to move from the Nash production taxes characterized in the second line of (8.5) to the e\u00a2 cient production taxes characterized in the second line of (8.4). Can GATT\u0092 s shallow approach to integration accommodate the implementation of the climate accord and maintain its solution to the trade problem, so that with the climate accord in place the world then reaches the e\u00a2 ciency frontier? This is indeed possible, but only if the home-country tari\u00a4 is allowed to rise with its carbon tax, from the initial level \u0016 de ned in (8.7) to the higher level the foreign-country export subsidy is allowed to rise with its carbon tax, from the initial level \u0016 \u0003de ned in (8.7) to the higher in (8.8) and (8.9) are evaluated at the tari\u00a4s ^ and^ \u0003and the e\u00a2 cient production taxes teandt\u0003e. Notice from (8.8) and (8.9) that ^ + ^ \u0003= 0and hence, in combination with the taxes teandt\u0003e, these tari\u00a4 adjustments, which I will refer to as \u0093carbon border adjustments,\u0094 will allow countries to reach the e\u00a2 ciency frontier as characterized in (8.4). Assuming that these carbon border adjustments are allowed, so that the home country can increase its import tari\u00a4 from \u0016 to^ and the foreign country can increase its export subsidy from \u0016 \u0003to^ \u0003, the remaining question is, again, whether the tari\u00a4s will then remain at the levels ^ and^ \u0003under GATT\u0092 s shallow integration rules as I have modeled them, given that the production taxes are pinned down by the climate accord at the levels teandt\u0003e. But it is direct to show that this is indeed the case. Focusing again on the home country, and evaluated at the tari\u00a4s ^ and^ \u0003and the e\u00a2 cient production taxes teandt\u0003e, d +dW d \u0003d \u0003 d jdepw=0= 0; implying that the home country can do no better than to select ^ in light of the reciprocal response from the foreign country that an increase in its tari\u00a4 beyond ^ would trigger. An analogous statement holds for the foreign country. The carbon border adjustments that I have characterized above have some in- teresting properties. They describe an increase in the home-country import tari\u00a4 that is to occur as the home country raises its carbon tax, and an increase in the foreign-country export subsidy that is to occur as the foreign country raises its carbon tax. These carbon border adjustments therefore work to o\u00a4set competitive e\u00a4ects that the implementation of higher carbon taxes would otherwise create for each country. In this sense they resonate with the purpose of proposed carbon border adjustments as seen from the perspective of the policy debate, namely as a mechanism for addressing possible trade competitiveness impacts and \u0093carbon leakage\u0094concerns that arise when a country considers implementing more strin- gent carbon policies and that were highlighted in the passage from Mattoo and 152Subramanian (2014) that I quoted at the beginning of this chapter.107 However, there is also a crucial di\u00a4erence: unlike the carbon border adjust- ments typically considered in the policy debate, which envision tari\u00a4s that would discriminate across the sources of imports based on measures of the carbon con- tent of those imports (see, for example, Bordo\u00a4, 2008, Mattoo and Subramanian, 2014, and Jensen, 2020), the carbon border adjustments described by (8.8) and (8.9) \u0096which imply changes in tari\u00a4s relative to \u0016 and\u0016 \u0003only because the second terms in these expressions are non-zero \u0096do notdepend on the carbon content of the production of one\u0092 s trading partner (as captured by c\u0003from the perspective of the home country and by cfrom the perspective of the foreign country). This is because these carbon border adjustments are designed to moderate the market access implication of a country\u0092 s own increase in carbon/production taxes, and to bring to an e\u00a2 cient level the market access that the country provides its trading partner as it raises its carbon tax to the e\u00a2 cient level. And while the market ac- cess implication of a country\u0092 s carbon tax increase does re\u0087 ect the carbon content of the country\u0092 s own production (because this enters into the determination of the size of the country\u0092 s carbon tax increase), that implication has nothing to do with the carbon content of production in a country\u0092 s trading partners. Indeed, as the second terms in (8.8) and (8.9) indicate, neither the carbon content of a trading partner\u0092 s production nor, aside from its impact on the world price ~pw, the level of the trading partner\u0092 s carbon tax, is relevant for the carbon border adjustments that the model would support. In fact, in this light it is easy to see that in a multi-country version of the model, the implied carbon border adjustments would be non-discriminatory (i.e., they would comply with the MFN principle). These properties can help avoid a number of practical problems often associated with the implementation of carbon border adjustments as those border adjustments are typically envisioned in the policy debate (see, for example, the discussion in World Bank, 2021, pp 41-43). It is instructive at this point to consider the related discussion of Mattoo and Subramanian (2014, p 24). They summarize the current state of the policy disagreements over carbon border adjustments this way: The question is whether such [carbon border] taxes can be designed in a way that addresses industrial countries\u0092concerns regarding competitiveness 107There is a large empirical literature investigating the trade e\u00a4ects of environmental regu- lation. See, for example, Cherniwchan and Najjar (2019) for a recent study of the impact of Canadian air quality standards on the export performance of Canadian manufacturing plants. 153while limiting the trade costs for developing countries. What has to be avoided is the imposition of tari\u00a4s applied across-the-board on the basis of the carbon content of imports, which would be a \u0093nuclear option\u0094in terms of trade consequences. For example, such an action by the United States and the EU would be the equivalent of imposing a tari\u00a4 of over 20percent on China and India, resulting in lost exports of about 20percent. Mattoo and Subramanian describe a number of possible solutions, of which their preferred approach involves ...across-the-board tari\u00a4s and rebates for exporters based on the carbon content in domestic production. These would almost completely o\u00a4set the adverse e\u00a4ects on U.S. output and exports of energy-intensive manufactures, while limiting declines in China\u0092 s and India\u0092 s manufacturing exports to about 2percent. The ndings above support the approach preferred by Mattoo and Subramanian. More generally, the discussion above points to an important insight: while the Nash tari\u00a4s in (8.5) are responsive to the carbon content of a trading partner\u0092 s production, there is no reason for the e\u00a2 cient tari\u00a4s as characterized in (8.6) to be based on the carbon content of a trading partner\u0092 s production, and this is true even in a world where cooperation over climate policy is impossible. The reason is that e\u00a2 ciency only pins down the sum of the tari\u00a4s between the home and foreign country; and to achieve the e\u00a2 cient sum of tari\u00a4s in (8.6) each country\u0092 s tari\u00a4 can be set at the level that re\u0087 ects the carbon content of its ownproduction. This insight also extends to a multi-country version of the model (because in such a world it is the sum of the tari\u00a4s along any bilateral trade path that are relevant for e\u00a2 ciency), and it implies that the role for discriminatory tari\u00a4s as a response to non-cooperative carbon policies is con ned to non-cooperative trade policy: if international cooperation over tari\u00a4s (and export subsidies) is possible, then the existence of a climate problem is not a reason to abandon the MFN principle, even when attempts to cooperate over climate policy have failed. 8.3. Negotiation linkage Thus far I have assumed either that there is no cooperation over climate policy or that a stand-alone climate accord is implemented, and I have considered how the GATT/WTO architecture might work in each of those circumstances. I now turn 154to a di\u00a4erent question, the question of linkage between a climate accord and a trade agreement such as the WTO. Maggi (2016) de nes three kinds of possible linkage between agreements: enforcement linkage, negotiation linkage and participation linkage. While each of these kinds of linkage is relevant for consideration in the speci c context of trade and climate agreements, I focus here on the possibility of a form of negotiation linkage, where a negotiation over tari\u00a4 liberalization and carbon taxes is linked through the market access implications of each. My starting point is the latecomers problem characterized by Bagwell and Staiger (2014) and described in chapter 7. Recall that this problem refers to the asymmetry in the level of market access commitments between the devel- oping/emerging economies on the one hand, and industrialized countries on the other, an asymmetry that has emerged after decades of reciprocal tari\u00a4 negotia- tions among industrialized countries, with the developing and emerging economies largely sitting on the sidelines as a result of exemptions to the reciprocity norm that were granted to these countries and codi ed in special and di\u00a4erential treat- ment clauses. This asymmetry is at the heart of various diagnoses of the central sticking points at Doha. In essence, industrialized countries want emerging and developing countries to agree to tari\u00a4 cuts in the Doha Round, but have few tari\u00a4 cuts of their own to put on the table in return. At the same time, a key sticking point in negotiating meaningful climate ac- cords is the strong asymmetry in the positions of emerging and developing coun- tries on the one hand, and industrialized countries on the other, regarding the desired response to climate change. Emerging and developing countries want in- dustrialized countries to agree to bear the brunt of addressing climate change, by for example imposing high carbon taxes on their producers, but emerging and developing countries have little leverage to induce industrialized countries to do this (Mattoo and Subramanian, 2014). And where industrialized countries are considering carbon taxes on their own, they see new carbon customs duties (car- bon border adjustments) as a way to o\u00a4set the trade competitiveness e\u00a4ects of carbon taxes on their rms and prevent carbon leakage (Jensen, 2020). Moreover, the new carbon customs duties that would accompany the imposition of carbon taxes by the industrialized countries would likely be imposed on the importation of products that are largely exported by developing and emerging economies (see, for example, Carbon Brief, 2017). The point I wish to emphasize is that these two asymmetries, one regarding the lowering of tari\u00a4s and the other regarding the imposition of carbon taxes, have market access implications that are in broad terms mirror images of each 155other. And it is these asymmetries that might be combined into a viable, linked market access negotiation. In particular, what is suggested by this discussion is the possibility of combining into a single, reciprocal package of negotiations the market access consequences of unilateral industrialized country carbon taxes \u0096 without border carbon adjustments \u0096and the unilateral tari\u00a4 cuts of emerging/developing economies. In e\u00a4ect, in such negotiations the emerging and developing countries would o\u00a4er reciprocal tari\u00a4 cuts in exchange for the market access consequences of carbon taxes o\u00a4ered by the industrialized countries. How might this linkage be operationalized? A natural possibility within the existing GATT/WTO structure (but in the absence of SDT) would be to follow a three-step procedure. In a rst step, industrialized countries (and possibly China, without whom a climate accord would likely fall short) would agree on an aggressive package of carbon mitigation policies (e.g., carbon taxes). Then, in a second step, these countries would initiate GATT Article XXVIII renegotiations with their trading partners, and in the context of these renegotiations introduce new MFN carbon customs duties on top of their existing tari\u00a4 bindings, calibrated to o\u00a4set the trade competitiveness (i.e., market access) e\u00a4ects of their new carbon policies, while o\u00a4ering their new carbon policies as compensation for their carbon customs duties.108And nally, in a third step, WTO members would engage in a round of tari\u00a4 negotiations under GATT Article XXVIII bis, with cuts in (and possibly elimination of) the new carbon customs duties of the industrialized countries now on the table and to be exchanged for reciprocal tari\u00a4 cuts from emerging and developing countries. Upon completion of this third step, the entire package of negotiated carbon taxes and tari\u00a4 bindings would be implemented. In the end, if the new carbon customs duties were eliminated as a result of the third- step negotiations, the emerging and developing countries would have o\u00a4ered tari\u00a4 cuts to industrialized countries (and possibly China) in exchange for the reciprocal market access consequences of the carbon taxes imposed by these countries.109 108Paragraph 2 of GATT\u0092 s Article XXVIII renegotiation clause states: In such negotiations and agreement, which may include provision for com- pensatory adjustment with respect to other products, the contracting par- ties concerned shall endeavour to maintain a general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions not less favourable to trade than that provided for in this Agreement prior to such negotiations. The o\u00a4ering of new carbon policies that o\u00a4set the market access consequences of the new MFN carbon customs duties that I describe in the text would be consistent with this stipulation. 109Notice that the border carbon adjustments at issue would play the role of neutralizing the 156A number of features of this linkage possibility are notable. First, the new carbon customs duties would be MFN , because they are designed simply to neu- tralize the market access e\u00a4ects of a country\u0092 s new carbon taxes. This is therefore what I would call a case of indirect linkage between climate and trade negotia- tions, because it links the market access consequences of new carbon taxes with the market access consequences of tari\u00a4 cuts, combining the market access im- plications of each into a reciprocal package. And in particular, from the WTO\u0092 s perspective, while this linkage could help to provide the balance across industri- alized and emerging/developing countries needed to unlock the Doha Round, it does not introduce issues beyond the market access consequences of policy that are in any event the WTO\u0092 s central concern. Second, there is an interesting political economy dimension: through this link- age, industrialized country export interests would be harnessed to push for carbon taxes, with the knowledge that carbon taxes would be accompanied by carbon cus- toms duties, and that reductions in the latter could be o\u00a4ered as bargaining chips to open foreign markets in GATT/WTO negotiating rounds. In making the politi- cal environment potentially more favorable to carbon taxes in this way, the linkage could help industrialized countries achieve more aggressive climate commitments. And third, international commitments on climate policy would gain a potent enforcement mechanism. If an industrialized country (or China) did not follow through on its climate commitments, then from the WTO\u0092 s perspective the coun- try would be violating its market access commitments, and emerging and devel- oping countries could then seek authorization from the WTO dispute settlement bodies to reciprocally raise their tari\u00a4s.110 In this way, the market access consequences of carbon taxes would be trans- formed from a bug into a feature. Instead of responding with border carbon adjustments, industrialized countries could use the market access consequences of carbon taxes as the engine of enforceable negotiated commitments on carbon policies and un nished Doha Round tari\u00a4 cuts. trade e\u00a4ects of carbon taxes, much as border tax adjustments neutralize the trade e\u00a4ects of destination-based value added taxes (VAT) such as those imposed by the EU (see Lockwood and Whalley, 2010, for a discussion of the connections across these two policy issues). I am then suggesting that industrialized countries could o\u00a4er to reduce these border carbon adjustments in market access negotiations with emerging and developing economies precisely for the market access/trade implications that the carbon taxes without the border tax adjustments would have. 110Whether such reciprocal responses would be su\u00a2 cient by themselves to enforce e\u00a2 cient carbon policies is an open question, but at a minimum they could form part of an e\u00a4ective enforcement mechanism for international climate commitments. 157What about carbon leakage? This is a potential concern, because under the three-step procedure described above the new carbon customs duties that are meant to prevent carbon leakage when an industrialized country introduces new carbon taxes could be bargained away. One approach to addressing this concern would be to link the reciprocal tari\u00a4 negotiations in the third step of the procedure described above with the transfer of clean technology. For example, Mattoo and Subramanian (2014) propose that an international fund might be set up to nance the transfer of \u0093green\u0094technologies to emerging and developing countries (see also the related discussion in World Bank, 2021, p 17). The new access to industrialized country markets that would arise from the described reciprocal tari\u00a4 negotiations might be conditioned on the adoption by emerging and developing country exporters of these green technolo- gies. Or the desired technology transfer might be accomplished via foreign direct investment (FDI) from industrialized countries to the emerging and developing countries, with emerging and developing countries agreeing to make liberalizing FDI commitments where needed as part of the third-step negotiations. Another approach, possibly complementary to the rst, would build on the ability of bilateral tari\u00a4 negotiations to minimize third-party trade e\u00a4ects when those negotiations conform to MFN and reciprocity as described in chapter 4. Under this approach, industrialized countries would seek out as bilateral tari\u00a4 bargaining partners in the third-step market access negotiations those emerging and developing countries with the cleanest technologies already in place for pro- ducing the products whose new carbon customs duties are on the bargaining ta- ble, regardless of principal supplier status. As in the chapter 2 discussion of tari\u00a4 bargaining techniques used by the United States under the 1934 RTAA, tari\u00a4 re- classi cations might also be made to further guide the grant of industrial-country market access toward clean-technology suppliers; and split concessions could be used to hold in reserve some tari\u00a4reductions for later adopters of green technology, incentivizing emerging and developing countries to undertake such investments. 9. Digital Trade111 We live in an increasingly digital world. The Internet and digitalization are fun- damentally changing the way people, rms and governments interact, both within 111This chapter is based on Staiger (2021), which was written as a background paper on Digital Trade and Trade Agreements for the Rotman School of Management of the University of Toronto. The background paper will not be separately published. 158and across national borders. Though de nitions vary and data is incomplete, economists concur that digital trade has revolutionized the global economy and will continue to do so. In 2018, digitally deliverable services comprised 50percent of overall global services exports, and estimates place the digital share of global GDP between ve and 16percent (UNCTAD, 2019). The consequences and op- portunities posed by the rapid expansion of digital commerce are felt by individual consumers, by small rms as well as large ones, and by economic superpowers as well as emerging and developing economies (see, e.g., Castro and McQuinn, 2015). In this chapter I consider the implications of digital trade for the design of the WTO, an institution whose main features were determined while the Internet was in its infancy.112Does the importance of digital trade today imply that the WTO\u0092 s approach to global trade rules is fundamentally out of date? Certainly digital trade has made possible new forms of trade protection. The US International Trade Commission o\u00a4ers a partial inventory: Localization requirements, market access limits, data privacy and protec- tion requirements, intellectual property rights infringement, uncertain le- gal liability rules, censorship, and customs measures in other countries all present obstacles to international digital trade. (USITC, 2014, p. 14) And in light of these novel forms of trade protection and the ubiquitous nature of digitalization in the global economy, a recent OECD Trade Policy paper argues that countries need to take a more \u0093holistic\u0094approach to market openness as a result of the rise of digital trade, stating:113 Today, a simple digital trade transaction rests on a series of trade-related factors that enable or support the transaction. For instance, the ability to order an e-book depends on access to a retailer\u0092 s website. This in turn depends on the regulatory environment which determines the conditions under which the retailer can establish the webpage as well as on the cost for the consumer of accessing the Internet \u0096a cost which, in turn, is a\u00a4ected by the regulatory environment in the telecommunications sector. The purchase 112This is not to say that WTO members have only recently become aware of the disruptive potential of the Internet for global trade rules. Soon after the WTO\u0092 s creation in 1995, the member governments agreed to convene a \u0093Work Programme on Electronic Commerce\u0094(WTO 1998), and an initial study of electronic commerce and the role of the WTO was issued in 1998 (Bacchetta, et al, 1998). See WTO (2018) for an updated WTO report on digital trade. 113This argument is made widely. See, for example, Ahmed (2019) and Ciuriak (2019). 159of the e-book will also be a\u00a4ected by other factors, such as the ability to pay electronically and the tari\u00a4 and non-tari\u00a4 barriers faced by the physical device used to read the e-book. A barrier on one of these linked transactions will a\u00a4ect the need or the ability to undertake the other transactions. This means that market openness needs to be approached more holistically, taking into consider- ation the full range of measures that a\u00a4ect the ability to undertake any particular transaction. For instance, Internet access may be a necessary but not su\u00a2 cient condition for digitally enabled trade in goods to \u0087 ourish. If logistics services in the receiving (or delivering) country are costly due to service trade restrictions, or if goods are held up at the border by cumber- some procedures, then the bene ts of the digital transformation may not materialise. (Casalini et al, 2019, p. 5). The WTO has been slow to take up this challenge, and as a result many WTO members have moved away from multilateral e\u00a4orts to update trade rules for the digital era, and are pursuing these goals in deep-integration regional and mega- regional agreements instead (Wu, 2017). To what extent these agreements should be seen as a model for the WTO\u0092 s approach to digital trade is an open question. In short, with digitalization permeating so deeply into modern life, it is tempt- ing to conclude that the world is now truly \u0093\u0087 at,\u0094that everything has changed.114 But for the speci c task of designing an e\u00a4ective trade agreement, can we be sure that everything is now di\u00a4erent? To evaluate the need for a re-design of the WTO in response to the rise of digital trade, I adopt a basic premise from the literature on the economics of trade agreements that I have carried throughout this book: namely, that the design of a trade agreement should re\u0087 ect its purpose. From this perspective, I ask: Does digital trade change the purpose of a trade agreement? Answering this question clari es the challenge that digital trade poses for the world trading system and can guide e\u00a4orts to update the WTO for the digital world. Below I introduce digital trade into a simple partial equilibrium framework of trade between two countries. For the most part I focus on trade in goods in this model world economy, but I also describe brie\u0087 y how the results generalize to a model that features trade in services. To set the stage, I rst shut down digital 114Friedman\u0092 s (2005) early pronouncement of the death of distance and that the world is now \u0087 at gave rise to critiques by economists (see e.g., Leamer, 2007) arguing that in fact distance was alive and well in the trade data (see, e.g., Disdier and Head, 2008). 160trade and consider the purpose of a trade agreement in a pre-digital world. I describe from the model\u0092 s perspective how this purpose is re\u0087 ected in the broad design features of the WTO agreements that govern international trade. This is true for trade in goods (GATT) as I have already indicated in previous chapters, but following Staiger and Sykes (2021) I describe how it is also true for trade in services as covered by the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), an agreement best characterized as an e\u00a4ort at deep integration. I then allow digital trade and revisit the purpose of a trade agreement as implied by the model, to investigate whether the problem for the agreement to solve has changed. It is from this perspective that I evaluate whether the rise of digital trade warrants fundamental changes in the design of the WTO. I follow the WTO and de ne digital trade as \u0093the production, distribution, marketing, sale or delivery of goods and services by electronic means.\u0094115A key question is how to introduce digital trade into a model world economy. Digital- ization impacts the economy through its impact on transaction costs. Surveying the literature on digital economics, Goldfarb and Tucker (2019, p. 3) observe: Understanding the e\u00a4ects of digital technology does not require funda- mentally new economic theory. However, it requires a di\u00a4erent emphasis. Studying digital economics starts with the question of \u0093what is di\u00a4erent?\u0094 What is easier to do when information is represented by bits rather than atoms? Digital technology often means that costs may no longer constrain economic actions. Therefore, digital economics explores how standard eco- nomic models change as certain costs fall substantially and perhaps ap- proach zero. Goldfarb and Tucker emphasize ve kinds of costs that can be substantially low- ered in the presence of digitalization: (i) search costs; (ii) replication costs; (iii) transportation costs; (iv) tracking costs; and (v) veri cation costs. They continue: Search costs are lower in digital environments, enlarging the potential scope and quality of search. Digital goods can be replicated at zero cost, mean- ing they are often non-rival. The role of geographic distance changes as 115I use the term \u0093digital trade\u0094 in the same way that the WTO uses the term \u0093electronic commerce,\" or \u0093e-commerce.\u0094 The de nition of digital trade that I quote in the text is the de nition of e-commerce adopted by the WTO\u0092 s Work Pro- gramme on Electronic Commerce, which can be found on the WTO web page at https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/minist_e/mc11_e/brie ng_notes_e/bfecom_e.htm. There are a variety of de nitions of digital trade that have been proposed in the literature (see Meltzer, 2019, for a discussion), but for my purposes the WTO de nition seems appropriate. 161the cost of transportation for digital goods and information is approxi- mately zero. Digital technologies make it easy to track any one individual\u0092 s behavior. Last, digital veri cation can make it easier to certify the repu- tation and trustworthiness of any one individual, rm, or organization in the digital economy. Each of these cost changes draws on a di\u00a4erent set of well-established economic models, primarily search, non-rival goods, trans- portation cost, price discrimination, and reputation models. (Goldfarb and Tucker, 2019, pp 3-4) A thorough analysis of the impacts of digital trade on the purpose of trade agree- ments would build from this taxonomy of cost implications, and would consider those impacts in each of a set of economic models that could appropriately micro- found the implications of reductions in each kind of cost.116 Rather than working with a modeling framework that captures the micro- foundations of how digitalization can impact any of these particular costs, here I take a reduced-form approach and simply assume that digitalization reduces the costs of international trade, and that in choosing their digital trade policies governments weigh the trade-cost reducing impacts that a more open digital en- vironment may bring against any possible non-pecuniary externalities associated with issues of privacy, national security, law enforcement and the like that may accompany such a policy. Admittedly, this approach misses many of the issues surveyed by Goldfarb and Tucker (2019), especially as these issues relate to the impact of digitalization on replication costs, tracking costs and veri cation costs. My intent here is to capture important impacts of digitalization on transportation costs and search costs with this modeling approach; I leave other dimensions of the impacts of digitalization on trade to future research. My approach to capturing the impacts of digitalization on trade is similar to that of Freund and Weinhold (2004), who model the impact of the Internet on trade in goods by assuming that it reduces the xed costs of entering a particular market. It is also in the spirit of the trade literature that interprets the impact that distance has on trade as re\u0087 ecting search and information frictions (see, for example, Allen, 2014, and Head and Mayer, 2014), and that views such frictions as diminished by the Internet and online markets (see, for example, Lendle et al, 2016, for trade in goods, and Blum and Goldfarb, 2006, for trade in services).117 116See McCalman (2021) for an early paper that develops an explicit model of search and social media to consider the role of trade agreements in a digital world. 117Blum and Goldfarb (2006) distinguish between \u0093taste-dependent\u0094 and \u0093non-taste- 1629.1. What is Digital Trade? While a variety of de nitions of digital trade have been proposed in the literature, as noted above I will follow the WTO and de ne digital trade to mean \u0093the production, distribution, marketing, sale or delivery of goods and services by electronic means.\u0094Before turning to my formal analysis, it is instructive to review brie\u0087 y some of the issues that arise in the struggle to de ne and classify digital trade in order to illuminate the nature of the potential challenges that digital trade poses for the WTO and the world trading system. For example, in describing the electronic commerce that comprises the WTO\u0092 s de nition of digital trade, Bacchetta et al (1998) distinguish among three stages in electronic transactions, any of which may occur on an arms-length or within- rm basis: the searching stage, the ordering and payment stage, and the delivery stage. Bacchetta et al elaborate on these stages as follows: The searching stage is where suppliers and consumers interact in the rst instance. This stage may or may not lead to an actual transaction. The second stage entails ordering and payment for the good or service, typically through the electronic transmittal of credit card or bank account information. The third stage is delivery. Only those transactions that can be concluded through electronic delivery of digitalized information may be carried through entirely on the Internet. Electronic commerce via the Inter- net must end at the second stage for purchases which cannot be delivered electronically, including physical goods like \u0087 owers or bicycles, and services that can only be supplied if the supplier and consumer are in physical prox- imity, like haircuts, tourism and construction. It is the expanded scope for the third stage of electronic commerce transactions \u0097 that of taking electronic delivery of the purchase \u0097 which is perhaps the most notable contribution of Internet technology and the most challenging aspect from a policy perspective. (Bacchetta et al, p. 1) Meltzer (2013, p. 11) notes the breadth of impact on trade that is implied by the three stages of electronic transactions identi ed by Bacchetta et al: dependent\u0094 services, and show that distance does not reduce demand for non-taste-dependent services that are web-based, consistent with the notion that digitalization has reduced distance- related trade costs for such services to zero. Blum and Goldfarb also nd that taste-dependent services continue to exhibit falling demand with distant even when they are web-based, and interpret this nding as re\u0087 ecting regional di\u00a4erences in taste. 163As these three stages demonstrate, the Internet allows for international trade in electronic goods and services and cross-border data \u0087 ows also have important indirect e\u00a4ects on international trade. For instance, advertising on search engines such as Google and Bing bring together overseas buyers and sellers and is often how consumers learn of the goods and services avail- able in other countries. Advertising is therefore often a necessary precursor to the online transaction that leads to international trade. The ability for researchers in di\u00a4erent countries to share data and collaborate can de- termine whether an international services trade occurs. The Internet and cross-border \u0087 ow of data is also crucial for other services that support and enable international trade, such as VoIP - internet based communications through sites such as Skype and email. Cross-border data \u0087 ows are also necessary for the nancial transfer to complete the transaction. The expanded scope for electronic delivery emphasized by Bacchetta et al (1998) raises several issues of particular concern for the WTO. First, there is the issue of whether the transaction involves a good or a service. This issue arises, for example, when considering a good that is delivered from a foreign source via digital instructions for additive manufacturing (\u00933D printing\u0094 ) in a domestic location. This issue is consequential because of the di\u00a4erent structure and level of market access commitments in GATT and GATS (see, e.g., Staiger, 2018). Second, if the transaction is determined to involve a service, there is the issue of by what mode the service is being delivered. GATS distinguishes among four modes of trade. \u0093Mode 1\u0094trade involves the cross-border sale of a service from the exporting country to a consumer in the importing country, while \u0093mode 2\u0094involves the consumption of a service in the exporting country by a national of another importing country. \u0093mode 3\u0094 trade involves the establishment of a commercial presence in the importing nation by a foreign service provider. And \u0093mode 4\u0094 trade occurs when a foreign supplier not only establishes a commercial presence in the importing nation, but also employs foreign nationals in its operations. Because WTO member governments have typically scheduled di\u00a4erent levels of market access commitments across the various modes of trade, the assignments of services to these modes is consequential. Digital trade raises new questions about these assignments (e.g., Should consumers visiting foreign websites to make purchases be viewed as analogous to them traveling abroad physically?). A taxonomy For the purposes of the analysis below, I need to partition the kinds of digital trades described above into \u0093digital trade in goods\u0094and \u0093digital 164trade in services.\u0094To this end I will say that trade is \u0093digital\u0094if it involves digital elements in any of the three stages of search, order and payment, or delivery, as described by Bacchetta et al (1998). And I will de ne a transaction as involving a \u0093good\u0094(\u0093service\u0094 ) if at the moment of consumption that transaction is a good (service) as traditionally de ned, i.e., as de ned in the pre-digital world.118 Thus, for my purposes, an Internet search, order and payment that results in the physical delivery of a book from a foreign publisher would be classi ed as digital trade in a good. And the cross-border transmission of instructions for 3D printing of a wallet will be classi ed as digital trade of a good (because it is a wallet at the moment of consumption), while the cross-border purchase of an e-book will be classi ed as digital trade of a service (because at the moment of consumption the purchaser is not acquiring the book, but rather the licence to read it). And some transactions, such as the importation of a car with Internet connectivity, may involve digital trade in both a good and a service. Where it is relevant below, I will adopt an analogous approach to identifying modes of supply within services: if a service was classi ed as mode X in the pre- digital world, then the digital service continues to be classi ed as mode X. Thus, if in the pre-digital world a domestic citizen would have traveled abroad and taken an in-person foreign cooking class but in the digital world stays at home and enrolls in the cooking class provided virtually from the foreign country over the Internet, I will continue to classify this in the digital world as trade in a mode-2 service, just as it would have been classi ed in the pre-digital world. What about truly \u0093new\u0094goods or services that did not exist in the pre-digital world? For the purposes of my taxonomy these goods and services could be treated like any new good in GATT or new service in GATS, that is, initially placed in the \u0093other\u0094category of the internationally standardized Harmonized System (HS) used by the WTO to classify goods and services.119 Importantly, in the analysis to follow I will assume that digitalization does not itself alter the feasibility of imposing a tari\u00a4 on the trade in question: if a tari\u00a4 can be imposed on the physical importation of a wallet, then I am assuming it is also feasible to impose the tari\u00a4 on the imported wallet when it is delivered by the cross-border transmission of instructions for 3D printing. 118That said, it should be noted that the exact boundary between goods and services is nowhere de ned in the WTO (see Smith and Woods, 2005). 119Though see Bacchetta et al (1998, p 51) for a discussion of possible issues with this approach when it comes to new services, and see WTO (2018, pp 168-170) for a review of WTO disputes that centered on the legal question of what quali es as a \u0093new\u0094good or service. 1659.2. What are the Policies that Impact Digital Trade? I noted above that I will take a reduced-form approach to modeling the impacts of digitalization on international trade. In particular and as noted there, in the analysis to follow I will simply assume that digitalization reduces the costs of international trade, and that in choosing their digital trade policies governments weigh the trade-cost reducing impacts that a more open digital environment may bring against any possible non-pecuniary externalities that may arise with such a policy. But what are these digital policies? I now describe the kinds of underlying policies that I attempt to capture with my reduced form modeling approach. Tari\u00a4s Tari\u00a4s are a straightforward policy for restricting trade, and in principle tari\u00a4s could constitute a central policy instrument for at least some kinds of digital trade, just as they have for trade in goods historically. But even here the impact of digitalization would be felt, as the small order sizes that the Internet has enabled might necessitate changes in the de minimis values below which customs duties do not apply (see, for example, USITC, 2013, p 5-23). More importantly, WTO members agreed in 1998 to a moratorium on customs duties applied to \u0093electronic transmissions of digital products and services,\u0094and this moratorium has been renewed every two years ever since.120That said, the issue of what kinds of digital trade this moratorium applies to, and whether the moratorium should be renewed, strengthened to a permanent commitment, or abandoned altogether, has been a growing source of contention among WTO members as the importance of digital trade has grown (see Azmeh, Foster and Echavarri, 2020). The future role of tari\u00a4s as a policy for restricting digital trade is therefore uncertain. Regulatory barriers to digital trade The more novel and contentious policies that impact digital trade involve a variety of regulatory issues. There are of course many regulations that have a restrictive impact on international trade and yet serve a legitimate public policy purpose, making the distinction between \u0093protection\u0094 and \u0093protectionism\u0094 often di\u00a2 cult to draw; the regulatory issues that arise with digital trade are no exception in this regard. But in the digital sphere many of the regulatory issues are still novel and lie at the center of concerns over highly sensitive questions regarding privacy, law enforcement and national 120The 2019 renewal of the WTO moratorium on customs duties applied to electronic trans- missions can be found at https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news19_e/gc_10dec19_e.htm. 166security, where shared norms of best practice and reasonable behavior are not yet fully developed or broadly accepted. As Aaronson (2018, p. 3) notes: Many allegations of digital protectionism are concerns about di\u00a4erent ap- proaches to regulating the data \u0087 ows that underpin the internet within national borders. Although the United States and the EU are trying to create shared rules, the two trade giants have also been the most vociferous in describing other countries\u0092approaches as \u0091 protectionist\u0092 . Nevertheless, there are some clear regulatory policy areas with respect to dig- ital trade where disciplines in the context of trade agreements are likely to be relevant. Azmeh, Foster and Echavarri (2020, pp 677-678) provide a useful dis- cussion in this regard (see also Meltzer, 2013). They o\u00a4er as illustration three examples of such policies: internet ltering to block cross-border access to certain websites, data localization, and source-code transfer requirements. As they note: Access to websites, digital tools, and services located on foreign servers is a prerequisite to access digital goods and services provided by rms, in- cluding both digitally delivered products and physically delivered products. As such, engineering the structure of the internet to block such cross-border access is a very e\u00a4ective way of controlling digital trade. ... Data localization policy is used to control trade \u0087 ows and access to foreign digital products. Data localization includes a number of policies that demand that data (or certain categories of data) generated within a state are subject to additional rules, typically rules requiring the storage of data domestically. Such a policy raises the cost of global rms serving a market by demanding that foreign digital rms build or purchase do- mestic data storage capacities. Through such a policy, data localization could strengthen the position of domestic rms and strengthen local digital ecosystems. ... Often as part of security requirements, a number of states adopt policies that seek to mandate technology transfer through policies such as source code transfer requirements. Such conditions can have major eco- nomic implications, as most companies will consider access to their source code a red line (due to the risks of losing key intellectual property), leading to this requirement serving as a market access restriction. Parallel policies are also emerging in regard to mandating rms to reveal encryption keys and algorithms. This can be a major issue for companies, as it could lead to 167blocking market access if they refuse to comply or to jeopardizing data se- curity and the trust of customers if they do. (Azmeh, Foster and Echavarri, 2020, pp 677-678). The reduced form approach to modeling the impacts of digitalization on inter- national trade that I introduce below cannot, of course, do justice to these subtle and complex policy issues, but neither is that my intent. Instead, motivated by these kinds of digital trade policies and the issues that they raise, my intent is simply to represent in a simple and tractable model some of the basic tradeo\u00a4s that governments must confront when making their digital policy choices, namely, tradeo\u00a4s between the lower trade costs that will obtain with a more open digital policy environment and the various non-trade issues that will arise. With this in mind, I next develop a benchmark model that can help to illumi- nate the purpose of trade agreements in a pre-digital and digital world. I devote the bulk of this chapter to a model of trade in goods, and consider only brie\u0087 y the extension of the model to trade in services, referring the interested reader to Staiger (2021) for a full development of that extension. 9.3. Digital Trade in Goods121 I begin by considering the case of digital trade in goods. I will think of an open digital policy environment as contributing to lower trade costs but also possibly generating an externality (e.g., related to privacy issues or concerns about national security) that may have both local and cross-border dimensions. I rst develop the benchmark model for trade in goods at a general level that incorporates both the pre-digital world and the digital world as special cases. I then consider the purpose of a trade agreement in each special case of this benchmark model. A benchmark trade-in-goods model I consider a simple partial equilibrium setting, in which a home country imports a competitively produced good from the foreign country, and I let I2[0;1)andI\u00032[0;1)denote respectively the home and foreign digital (\u0093Internet\u0094 ) policies, with I= 0(I\u0003= 0) corresponding to the absence of a workable Internet in the home (foreign) country, and with a higher level of I(I\u0003) corresponding to a more open digital policy environment in the home (foreign) country. I assume that these policies, which I take to represent 121The material in this section is a slightly adapted and reinterpreted version of the material in section 4.1.1 of Staiger (2019). 168the kinds of regulatory barriers to digital trade described in section 9.2, jointly determine the e\u00a2 ciency of trade transactions between the two countries, and in particular that the per-unit (speci c) trade cost for exports from foreign to home, \u0013, can be represented by the function \u0013(I;I\u0003), where\u0013(0;0)is non-prohibitive and with\u0013(I;I\u0003)decreasing and convex in both its arguments and non-negative for all IandI\u0003.122To x ideas, the good under consideration could be a wallet, and the openness of digital policies in each country could determine the e\u00a2 cacy of digital search including the possibility of targeted ads, the functioning of digital payment systems, and the feasibility of digital delivery through 3D printing. With the import tari\u00a4set by the home government denoted by and the export tax set by the foreign government denoted by \u0003(both expressed in speci c terms), the arbitrage relationship between the home-country price of this good ( p) and the foreign-country price of the good ( p\u0003) that must hold as long as strictly positive trade occurs is given by p=p\u0003+\u0013(I;I\u0003) + + \u0003: (9.1) I de ne the foreign world price and the home world price bypw\u0003\u0011p\u0003+ \u0003and pw\u0011p\u0000 , respectively. The foreign and home world prices are measures of the foreign- and home-country terms of trade \u0096the foreign terms of trade improves whenpw\u0003rises, the home terms of trade improves when pwfalls \u0096and by (9.1) they are related by pw\u0000pw\u0003=\u0013(I;I\u0003). A drop in trade costs \u0013bringspwandpw\u0003 closer together, and when \u0013= 0the home and foreign world prices are equated. I denote the home and foreign demands for the product under consideration byD(p)andD\u0003(p\u0003), and I assume that these demand functions are decreas- ing in their arguments; and for simplicity I assume that the product is supplied only by the foreign country, and denote foreign supply by the increasing function S\u0003(p\u0003).123Using the pricing relationship (9.1), and denoting foreign export sup- ply byE\u0003(p\u0003)\u0011S\u0003(p\u0003)\u0000D\u0003(p\u0003)and home import demand by M(p)\u0011D(p), the market clearing condition may be written as M(p\u0003+\u0013(I;I\u0003) + + \u0003) =E\u0003(p\u0003); 122Rather than reducing the per-unit costs of trade, a more realistic assumption might be that the Internet reduces the xed cost of entering a particular market, as in Freund and Weinhold (2004). Incorporating such an assumption would require the use of a more involved model of ( rm-level) trade than the simple (industry-level) model I adopt here, but I suspect that my conclusions would extend to that setting (see for example Bagwell and Lee, 2020, who show that the purpose of a trade agreement is unchanged by the introduction of heterogeneous rms). 123Here and throughout I will I assume that supply curves are una\u00a4ected by digital policy, but none of the conclusions I emphasize below depend on this assumption. 169yielding the market clearing foreign price ~p\u0003(\u0013(I;I\u0003) + + \u0003)from which the market clearing home price and foreign and home world prices also follow: ~p(\u0013(I;I\u0003) + + \u0003)\u0011~p\u0003(\u0013(I;I\u0003) + + \u0003) +\u0013(I;I\u0003) + \u0003; )\u0011~p(\u0013(I;I\u0003) + + \u0003)\u0000 : Again as is standard, world prices depend on both and \u0003, but home and foreign prices depend only on the sum + \u0003(and on the digital policies IandI\u0003). With the market clearing price expressions above, the terms-of-trade impacts of policy choices can now be assessed. Regarding the terms-of-trade impacts of trade taxes, direct calculations yield (with a prime denoting the derivative of the function with respect to its argument): @~pw @ expected, an increase in the home-country tari\u00a4 improves the home terms of trade and worsens the foreign terms of trade, while an increase in the foreign- country tari\u00a4 has the opposite impact, improving the foreign terms of trade and worsening the home terms of trade. These are the familiar terms-of-trade e\u00a4ects of tari\u00a4 intervention that I have featured throughout the book, and they provide the basis for the ine\u00a2 cient prisoners\u0092dilemma situation that according to the terms- of-trade theory of trade agreements arises in the absence of a trade agreement. The terms-of-trade impacts of digital openness (increases in IandI\u0003) are more novel.124The impacts of a more open home-country digital policy are a more open foreign-country digital policy these impacts are given makes the same point about investments in trade facilitation more generally. 170Evidently, an open home-country digital policy improves the home-country terms of trade while at the same time improving the terms of trade of the foreign country , and similarly for an open foreign-country digital policy. This \u0093win-win\u0094 prospect for open digital policies makes it tempting to con- clude that the terms-of-trade theory cannot explain why countries would need an international agreement to encourage open digital policies at all. But as I will demonstrate below, this is not correct. Intuitively, the key is to note from the derivative expressions in (9.2) and (9.3) above that each country\u0092 s digital open- ness imparts a positive terms-of-trade externality on the other country, providing a possible reason for under -provision of digital openness from an international perspective when countries are guided only by their unilateral interests (i.e., in the absence of an international agreement that covers digital trade policies), and therefore a possible role for a trade agreement that encourages digital openness. I now de ne the welfare functions for the home and foreign countries. I abstract from political economy/distributional motives, though for reasons analogous to those discussed in chapter 2 the results I report below are easily generalized to include such motives. But I allow an open digital environment in a country to generate a non-pecuniary externality, possibly relating to privacy issues or to national security concerns. I assume that this externality takes an \u0093eyesore\u0094 form that does not itself a\u00a4ect production and is not internalized by individual consumers and hence does not a\u00a4ect demands, but that detracts in a separable way from aggregate welfare. Moreover, I assume that this externality may have both a local and a cross-border component, with the local component increasing in own-digital openness and the cross-border component increasing in the digital openness of one\u0092 s trading partner. For example, more digital openness in the home country (higher I) might create a digital environment where malicious software could more easily be downloaded to the devices of home-country citizens; and this malicious software might (or might not) then negatively impact foreign citizens as well. Formally, I denote by c(I)andc\u0003(I\u0003)the local externality generated in the home and foreign country by the respective levels of digital openness IandI\u0003, withc(0) = 0 andc\u0003(0) = 0 and withcandc\u0003increasing and convex in their respective arguments; and I let the parameter \u00122[0;1]govern the degree of cross-border spillovers, so that the externality from the digital policies IandI\u0003 reduces home-country welfare by the amount [c(I) +\u0012c\u0003(I\u0003)]and reduces foreign- country welfare by the amount [c\u0003(I\u0003) +\u0012c(I)]. With no home-country production, home welfare is then given by the sum 171of consumer surplus plus tari\u00a4 revenue minus the cost of the externality from digital openness. Letting CSdenote home-country consumer surplus and using =p\u0000pw, home welfare is given by W=W(I;I\u0003;~p(\u0013(I;I\u0003) + + \u0003);~pw(\u0013(I;I\u0003) + \u0003; )) (9.4) +\u0012c\u0003(I\u0003)]: Accounting for foreign-country production and with PS\u0003the foreign producer surplus, foreign welfare is de ned as the sum of consumer and producer surplus plus export tax revenue minus the cost of the externality from digital openness: W\u0003=W\u0003(I\u0003;I;~p\u0003(\u0013(I;I\u0003) + + \u0003);~pw\u0003(\u0013(I;I\u0003) + ; \u0003)) +PS\u0003(~p\u0003(\u0013(I;I\u0003) + \u0003)) \u0003)]\u0002E\u0003(~p\u0003(\u0013(I;I\u0003) + + \u0003)) \u0000[c\u0003(I\u0003) +\u0012c(I)]: Finally, the sum of home and foreign welfare, which I refer to as \u0093world welfare\u0094 and denote by Ww, is given by Ww=Ww(I;I\u0003;~p(\u0013(I;I\u0003) + + \u0003);~p\u0003(\u0013(I;I\u0003) + + \u0003)) (9.6) \u0011CS(~p(\u0013(I;I\u0003) + \u0003)) \u0000[c(I) +\u0012c\u0003(I\u0003)]\u0000[c\u0003(I\u0003) +\u0012c(I)]: Notice from (9.4)-(9.6) that while home and foreign welfare each depend on their respective world prices and hence on the levels of both and \u0003, world welfare is independent of world prices \u0096because movements in these prices only serve to redistribute surplus between the home and foreign country \u0096and hence we have the now-familiar property that world welfare depends only on the sum of home and foreign tari\u00a4s + \u0003(in addition to the digital openness levels IandI\u0003). The purpose of GATT in a pre-digital world I will think of the pre-digital world as corresponding to a special case of the benchmark trade-in-goods model described above in which I\u00110\u0011I\u0003(9.7) 172and there is no workable Internet in either country. In this pre-digital world, the benchmark trade-in-goods model is very simple and the purpose of a trade agreement is transparent and familiar from chapter 2. Nevertheless, it is useful to review the steps in determining the purpose of a trade agreement in this speci c setting, so that a comparison with the digital world can be drawn. Under (9.7), trade costs are exogenous and given by \u0013(0;0)\u0011\u0016\u0013, and with no workable Internet anywhere in the world we also have an absence of digital externalities c(0) =c\u0003(0) = 0 . Hence, in the pre-digital world, the only policy choice to be made by each country is its tari\u00a4 choice, and (9.4)-(9.6) imply that the country and world welfare levels as functions of these policy choices can be expressed in the form W(~p(\u0016\u0013+ + \u0003);~pw(\u0016\u0013+ \u0003; \u0003);~p\u0003(\u0016\u0013+ + \u0003)). It is direct to show and intuitive that there is no e\u00a2 ciency role for tari\u00a4s in this setting, and hence 0 (9.8) where a superscript \u0093 e\u0094denotes e\u00a2 cient policies. And the Nash policies adopted by the two countries in the absence of a trade agreement, which I denote by N and \u0003N, are given by N=~pw\u0003N \u0011E\u0003Nand \u0003N=~pwN \u0011MN; (9.9) with\u0011E\u0003Nthe elasticity of foreign export supply and \u0011MNthe elasticity of home import demand (de ned positively) and with ~pw\u0003Nand~pwNthe world prices, all evaluated at Nash policies. The Nash tari\u00a4s in (9.9) represent the usual inverse- trade-elasticity formulae for the Johnson (1953-54) optimal tari\u00a4 that applies in a competitive market setting when governments seek to maximize real national incomes with their unilateral tari\u00a4 choices. Clearly, then, as a comparison of (9.9) with (9.8) con rms, in the pre-digital world of this benchmark trade-in-goods model, Nash tari\u00a4s are too high and Nash trade volumes are too low, and the purpose of a trade agreement is to eliminate the beggar-thy-neighbor incentives that each country has to manipulate the terms-of- trade with its unilateral tari\u00a4choice, and thereby to enjoy the mutual bene ts from the expanded trade volumes that come from implementation of internationally e\u00a2 cient policies. Moreover, while for simplicity I have adopted here a model setting where governments have no objectives beyond the maximization of real national income and there are no non-tari\u00a4 policy choices to be made in the pre- digital world, I described in chapters 2 and 3 how Bagwell and Staiger (1999, 2001) 173establish that the purpose of a trade agreement is unchanged in the presence of diverse government policy objectives and when domestic policies are added to the picture, and how these ndings can illuminate the logic of GATT\u0092 s design. I consider next whether these ndings hold in a world of digital trade in goods. The purpose of GATT in a digital world In a world of digital trade in goods, the condition in (9.7) does not hold. According to the benchmark trade-in- goods model, this has two implications. First, the levels of digital openness Iand I\u0003constitute additional policies that have terms-of-trade impacts, and as noted above each of these policies generates a win-win outcome for the two countries when it is set at a more open level. And second, greater digital openness generates a (negative) non-pecuniary externality (which may or may not cross borders). To see what di\u00a4erence all of this makes for the purpose of a trade agreement, as I did when considering the pre-digital world I rst characterize e\u00a2 cient policies, then characterize Nash policies, and then compare the e\u00a2 cient and Nash policies to identify the purpose of a trade agreement covering goods trade in a digital world. It is useful to consider two possibilities for the digital world, one where the non-pecuniary externality associated with digital openness is purely local and does not spill over across borders, and the other where this externality has both local and cross-border components. I consider rst the case of a purely local non-pecuniary externality from digital openness. To this end, I now impose the following No cross-border non-pecuniary externality :\u0012\u00110; (Assumption 1) and I note that (9.4)-(9.6) imply that the country and world welfare levels in a digital world under Assumption 1 can be written in the form W(I;~p(\u0013(I;I\u0003) + + \u0003);~pw(\u0013(I;I\u0003) + \u0003; )) W\u0003(I\u0003;~p\u0003(\u0013(I;I\u0003) Ww(I;I\u0003;~p(\u0013(I;I\u0003) + + \u0003);~p\u0003(\u0013(I;I\u0003) + + \u0003)): As before, I de ne e\u00a2 cient policies as those that maximize world welfare. In the digital world, world welfare depends on the sum of the home and foreign tari\u00a4s, + \u0003, and on the degree of home and foreign digital openness, Iand I\u0003. As before, the rst-order conditions that de ne the sum of e\u00a2 cient tari\u00a4s, @Ww=@[ + \u0003] = 0, can to yield [ + \u0003]\u0002@E\u0003 @p\u0003@~p\u0003 is no e\u00a2 ciency role for tari\u00a4s, and this is true regardless of the degree of digital openness in each country (and hence regardless of trade costs \u0013). Consider next the e\u00a2 cient level of home and foreign digital openness, denoted byIeandI\u0003erespectively. The rst-order condition that volume evaluated at e\u00a2 cient policies and where in writing (9.11) I have used the market clearing condition M=E\u0003. In words, the e\u00a2 cient level of home-country digital openness Ieequates the marginal bene t of the last unit of digital opening allowed by the home country (the marginal savings in total trade costs Me\u0001[\u0000@\u0013 @I]) with the marginal cost to the home country owing to the impact of this additional digital opening on the local non-pecuniary externality that is associated with the home country\u0092 s digital openness ( c0(\u0001)). The e\u00a2 cient level of digital openness for country, I\u0003e, is similarly characterized: Me\u0002[\u0000@\u0013 @I\u0003] IandI\u0003enter symmetrically into the trade cost function \u0013(I;I\u0003), then the e\u00a2 cient digital policies will di\u00a4er across countries to the extent that the (local) externalities from digital openness di\u00a4er in the two countries. Hence, the functions c(\u0001)andc\u0003(\u0001)play a role analogous to the di\u00a4erence across countries in their \u0093preferences\u0094 for labor or environmental standards entertained by Bagwell and Staiger (2001).125 125In this regard, my modeling of digital openness therefore resonates with the position of Goldfarb and Tre\u0087 er (2019), who argue that a country\u0092 s choice of privacy policy in the context of Arti cial Intelligence technologies raises issues analogous to those associated with the national choice of labor and environmental standards. However, in contrast to Goldfarb and Tre\u0087 er and to Bagwell and Staiger (2001), I focus here on the impact of digital openness on trade costs. 175Next consider the Nash policies adopted by the two countries in the absence of a trade agreement. The rst-order conditions for the home country that de ne its best-response levels of andIare given by @W @ =\u0000M(~p)@~p @ rst-order conditions for the foreign country that de ne its best- response levels of \u0003andI\u0003are given by @W\u0003 @ \u0003=\u0000E\u0003(~p\u0003)@~p\u0003 denote by N,IN, \u0003NandI\u0003N, satisfy the four rst- order conditions in (9.13) and (9.14) simultaneously. Now notice from the pricing relationships above that@~p @ =@~p @\u0013and@~p\u0003 @\u0013\u0003. Using this, substituting the top rst-order condition in (9.13) into the bottom rst-order condition in (9.13), and simplifying the top condition in (9.13) further, and performing the analogous steps for the rst order conditions in (9.14), it follows that the Nash tari\u00a4s are N=~pw\u0003N \u0011E\u0003Nand \u0003N=~pwN \u0011MN; =c0(IN)andMN\u0002[\u0000@\u0013 @I\u0003] =c\u00030(I\u0003N); (9.16) where, as before, \u0011E\u0003Nis the elasticity of foreign export supply and \u0011MNis the elasticity of home import demand (de ned positively) and where ~pw\u0003N,~pwNand MNdenote their respective previously-de ned magnitudes, all evaluated at Nash policies. The Nash tari\u00a4s in (9.15) again represent the usual Johnson optimal tari\u00a4; and the Nash digital openness levels described by (9.16) equate the mar- ginal bene t of further digital openness with its marginal cost, just as described previously in the context of e\u00a2 cient policy choices. 176What is the di\u00a4erence between the problem for GATT to solve in the digital world and the insu\u00a2 cient-market-access problem that I characterized above in the pre-digital world? As in the pre-digital world, Nash tari\u00a4s in the digital world are ine\u00a2 ciently high, as a comparison between (9.15) and (9.10) con rms. And in the digital world, the degree of digital openness as re\u0087 ected in the levels of IandI\u0003is too low in the Nash equilibrium relative to the e\u00a2 cient level, as can be con rmed from a comparison of (9.16) and (9.11)-(9.12) and noting that MN<Meimplies IN<IeandI\u0003N<I\u0003e.126 But notice that given the Nash level of trade volume MN, the expressions in (9.16) that implicitly de ne INandI\u0003Nare identical to the expressions in (9.11)-(9.12) that implicitly de ne IeandI\u0003e. This is the same structure that Bagwell and Staiger (2001) exploited to demonstrate that the only problem for a trade agreement to solve is the insu\u00a2 cient-market-access problem, the same problem that I characterized above in the pre-digital world. And it implies that the purpose of a trade agreement is unchanged by the introduction of digital trade in goods. Speci cally, in both the pre-digital and digital worlds, the purpose of GATT is to reduce tari\u00a4s and thereby expand market access to e\u00a2 cient levels. If design re\u0087 ects purpose, then the common purpose of GATT across the pre- digital and digital worlds that I have just described suggests that in principle there is no reason for the design of GATT to change in the presence of digital trade in goods. To see what this implies for the design of GATT in a digital world, I now describe in detail how the logic of shallow integration \u0096the same logic that Bagwell and Staiger (2001) showed would hold when governments can chose both tari\u00a4s and domestic standards \u0096continues to apply in the digital world. A rst observation is that an agreement to set tari\u00a4s at free trade will not by itself achieve the e\u00a2 ciency frontier, because as is easily shown such an agreement would induce each country to reduce its digital openness as a second-best means of manipulating its terms of trade once the agreement constrains its tari\u00a4s away from such behavior. One approach, then, is for governments to negotiate over both tari\u00a4s and their digital policies to ensure that the conditions for e\u00a2 ciency in (9.10) and (9.11)-(9.12) are met. But as I have noted, this deep-integration approach is not the approach that GATT has traditionally taken. Instead, GATT\u0092 s shallow- integration approach can in principle work in a digital world as follows. Beginning from the Nash policies given by (9.15)-(9.16), suppose that govern- 126This follows from the convexity of c(\u0001)andc\u0003(\u0001). 177ments negotiate over tari\u00a4s and agree to a pair of tari\u00a4s ~ and~ \u0003that satisfy M(~p(\u0013(IN;I\u0003N) + ~ + ~ \u0003)) =Me: (9.17) According to (9.17), in this rst step countries would agree to a pair of tari\u00a4s that deliver the e\u00a2 cient level of market access and hence import volume in light of their existing non-cooperative digital policies INandI\u0003N. Given that the non-cooperative digital policies are less open than e\u00a2 cient digital policies, (9.17) implies that the tari\u00a4s that governments would agree to in their negotiation would be below the e\u00a2 cient free-trade levels. Then, subsequent to these tari\u00a4 negotiations, suppose that each government is allowed to set/adjust its digital policy unilaterally, but that governments are subject to a market access preservation rule of the following form: if a government alters its digital policy from the Nash level, it must also adjust its tari\u00a4 to preserve the market access level implied by its original negotiated tari\u00a4 commitment. Since policy adjustments by one country which preserve market access also preserve the equilibrium trade volume, policy adjustments for the home government that satisfy the market access preservation rule are de ned by d dIjdM=0=\u0000@~p @\u0013@\u0013 @I @~p @ >0 (9.18) with an analogous condition holding for the foreign government. The inequality in (9.18) follows from the signs of price derivatives reported above and implies that the home government must lower (can raise) its tari\u00a4 if it reduces (increases) its digital openness subsequent to tari\u00a4 negotiations with the foreign country, and similarly for the foreign government. Subject to this market access preservation rule, what digital policy will the home government choose? Its unilateral choice will satisfy the rst-order condition @W @I+@W @ @~p @ = 0: But using the pricing relationships reported above, this condition simpli es to Me\u0002[\u0000@\u0013 @I] =c0(Ie); 178the condition cient home-country digital policy reported in (9.11). Hence, with the market access preservation rule preventing the home-country government from manipulating the terms of trade with its choice of digital policy, the home-country government would choose to unilaterally liberalize its digital policy to the e\u00a2 cient level Iewhile at the same time raising its tari\u00a4 from ~ to its e\u00a2 cient level so as to preserve the (e\u00a2 cient) level of market access that was implied by its tari\u00a4 negotiations. An analogous argument applies to the foreign-country government. Evidently, by this shallow-integration approach, governments can ensure that the conditions for e\u00a2 ciency in (9.10)-(9.12) are met. At a conceptual level, the arguments above imply that, despite the fact that digitalization has indisputably permeated deeply into the modern world, there is no more (or less) reason to take a \u0093holistic\u0094(i.e., deep) approach to liberalization in the digital world than there was in the pre-digital world. At a more practical level and as I noted more generally in chapter 3, these arguments do not so much mean that no degree of deep integration is necessary in a digital world as they provide a potentially useful guardrail that can help delineate the \u0093depth\u0094 that deep trade agreements should go in the digital world: according to these results, just as in the pre-digital world there is no reason to go deeper in a trade agreement for the world of digital trade in goods than what is required to ensure that property rights over negotiated market access are reasonably secure. Up until now I have maintained Assumption 1 in order to abstract from the possibility that an open digital policy might lead to cross-border non-pecuniary externalities. I now relax Assumption 1, and allow the non-pecuniary externalities associated with digital trade to cross borders. This implies that welfare functions are now given by (9.4)-(9.6). Notice that the presence of cross-border non-pecuniary externalities does not alter the Nash policy choices of the two governments, which will still be char- acterized by (9.15)-(9.16), because with \u0012 >0the only di\u00a4erence in a country\u0092 s welfare function is that its welfare is now reduced directly (for given prices) when itstrading partner\u0092 s digital policy is more open, and this is a policy choice that a country has no say in under noncooperative Nash choices. But with \u0012>0, the ef- cient policy choices will now be di\u00a4erent than they were under Assumption 1. In particular, it is direct to show that while the e\u00a2 cient tari\u00a4s are still characterized by (9.10), the e\u00a2 cient levels of digital openness are now characterized by Me\u0002[\u0000@\u0013 @I] = [1 +\u0012]\u0002c0(Ie) (9.19) [1 +\u0012]\u0002c\u00030(I\u0003e) (9.20) for the (9.19)-(9.20) with (9.11)- (9.12) con rms, e\u00a2 ciency requires a less-open digital policy for each country when digital openness imposes cross-border (negative) externalities on trading part- ners.127And this implies that the e\u00a2 cient trade volume is also lower. What does this mean for the purpose of a trade agreement? As I now demon- strate, when digital trade in goods generates cross-border non-pecuniary external- ities, the purpose of a trade agreement is no longer simply to solve the insu\u00a2 cient- market-access problem that I characterized in the pre-digital world. Rather, there are now two problems to solve: the cross-border non-pecuniary externality must be addressed; and conditional on addressing this rst problem, the insu\u00a2 cient market access problem familiar from the pre-digital world must also be addressed. To see that the problem is now more complex, suppose rst that countries at- tempted the same shallow-integration approach that I described previously when Assumption 1 held. By negotiating to the appropriate tari\u00a4s, governments could position their market access at the e\u00a2 cient level appropriate for the case where Assumption 1 is violated and \u0012 >0. The problem is that under the subsequent unilateral policy adjustments subject to the market access preservation rule, gov- ernments would choose levels of digital openness IandI\u0003that satis (9.11)- (9.12), not the conditions for e\u00a2 ciency (9.19)-(9.20) that are relevant when \u0012>0. This implies that the GATT\u0092 s shallow approach to integration is no longer ap- propriate for a world of digital trade in goods if that trade generates signi cant cross-border non-pecuniary externalities. Notice, though, that even in this case there may be an approach to integration suggested by the discussion above that lies somewhere between shallow integration on the one hand, and on the other hand fully deep integration where countries negotiate over all aspects of digital policy that enter into IandI\u0003in addition to their tari\u00a4s. This is because if countries could focus on just those aspects of their digital openness that are generating the cross\u0096 border non-pecuniary externalities and address those externalities with limited negotiations, then, from that point forward, we would be back in a world analogous to the world where Assumption 1 applies and where achieving the e\u00a2 ciency frontier with GATT\u0092 s shallow approach to integration is possible.128I explore this possibility at the end of this chapter. 127Again this follows from the convexity of c(\u0001)andc\u0003(\u0001). 128While the existence of a cross-border non-pecuniary externality that I analyze here therefore 1809.4. Digital Trade in Services In Staiger (2021) I extend the model of digital goods trade that I developed in section 9.3 to the case of digital trade in services, and there I perform a parallel analysis for trade in services. I focus on mode 3services trade in order to re\u0087 ect the emphasis of GATS commitments.129A useful illustrative example might be trade in construction services. In the pre-digital world, a foreign construction company opens a branch o\u00a2 ce in the home-country market and takes on local road construction projects, thereby providing mode 3exports of construction services to the home country. In the digital world, all that is still true, but the foreign company advertises its construction services on its foreign website where orders are placed and where electronic payments are also made, and it digitally communicates with the home-country branch o\u00a2 ce over initial orders and any change orders that arise during the course of construction; and the openness of digital policies in each country can impact the functioning of each of these digital tasks.130 In the pre-digital world, my model of trade in services collapses to that of Staiger and Sykes (2021). As Staiger and Sykes observe, the approach to mar- ket access liberalization taken by GATS is strikingly at odds with the shallow- integration approach taken by GATT, and is instead more aptly described as a deep-integration approach, whereby the negotiated change or removal of domestic regulations and other non-tari\u00a4 barriers to trade in service sectors is seen as the primary method of expanding market access. And while mode 3services trade has several de ning characteristics that are incorporated into the model, including (i) the need for foreign capital to locate in the importing country and establish a commercial presence, (ii) the frequent existence of market failures that o\u00a4er a does change the purpose of a trade agreement, it does so in a way that suggests the possibility of addressing the various problems in separable ways as I have just described, and in this sense is very di\u00a4erent from the complications raised by \u0093o\u00a4shoring\u0094 and highlighted by Antras and Staiger (2012a, 2012b), where the nature of the pecuniary externality is itself altered. I return to this point at the end of this chapter, and discuss o\u00a4shoring in detail in chapter 10. 129For mode 3services, where a commercial presence in the importing country must be es- tablished, it is still the case that restrictive digital policies can raise the cost of trade as I assumed in section 9.3. For example, data localization requirements can raise the costs of trade by eliminating the option of cloud storage and thereby forcing a mode 3service provider to invest in costly cyber security for its local data (see, for example, the discussion in Goldfarb and Tre\u0087 er, 2019, and the reports listed in the Google Public Policy Blog posting https://publicpolicy.googleblog.com/2015/02/the-impacts-of-data-localization-on.html). 130There is also the increasing possibility of digitally delivering construction services; see, for example, Lasky (2019) on the construction of homes via 3D printing. 181legitimate purpose for domestic regulations, and (iii) a lack of readily available tari\u00a4-like instruments given that mode 3trade does not cross national borders, Staiger and Sykes establish that the key feature of mode 3services trade that according to the terms-of-trade theory can account for the distinctive design of GATS relative to GATT is characteristic (iii), the lack of a readily available tari\u00a4- like instrument that can be applied to mode 3services trade. As they demonstrate, but for this feature, the problem for an agreement on trade in services to solve \u0096 and hence, presumably, the design of the agreement \u0096would be identical to that for an agreement on trade in goods. In Staiger (2021) I adopt this \u0093missing tari\u00a4instrument\u0094perspective on GATS, and I extend the partial equilibrium model of mode 3services trade put forward by Staiger and Sykes to allow for the possibility of digital trade in services. The design of GATS How can the lack of a tari\u00a4 instrument for traded (mode 3) services account for the striking di\u00a4erence between GATT and GATS? In short, without a tari\u00a4to manipulate its services terms of trade, an importing government will in the Nash equilibrium tend to spread protective distortions widely across the policy instruments that it does wield in the service sector, thereby \u0093contam- inating\u0094many of its Nash policies with internationally ine\u00a2 cient terms-of-trade motives. And if this describes the starting point from which governments would have considered the design of a trade-in-services agreement, the strategy of bor- rowing heavily from the shallow-integration design features of GATT would not seem like an obvious and natural, or even viable, way to proceed, so much so that it seems plausible that this strategy may not have even occurred to GATS negotiators. Rather, facing evident behind-the-border policy distortions spread throughout the domestic service market, a decision to adopt a deep-integration approach to services liberalization seems almost inevitable. From this perspective, and as Staiger and Sykes (2021) argue in the context of a pre-digital model world economy, the lack of an e\u00a4ective tari\u00a4or tari\u00a4-equivalent policy instrument for (mode 3) service-sector intervention can go a long way in accounting for the striking di\u00a4erences in the architecture of GATS and GATT. A GATS redesign for the pre-digital world Nevertheless, as Staiger and Sykes (2021) demonstrate for the pre-digital world, this does not mean that shal- low integration is impossible for services. Rather, it is possible to exploit the elements of the trade-in-goods problem that are shared with the trade-in-services problem to devise a \u0093two-step\u0094path forward for liberalizing trade in services that 182has much in common with the shallow-integration approach of GATT. As Staiger and Sykes (2021) describe, in a rst step governments would agree to a set of blanket rules to apply to services along the lines of the GATT rules that apply to goods, namely: (i) the national treatment (NT) rule, which prohibits do- mestic regulatory (and tax) policies that discriminate against foreign trade; (ii) the agreement on technical barriers to trade (TBT), which prohibits unnecessarily trade restrictive regulatory choices; and (iii) the non-violation (NV) clause, which protects the value of market access concessions from erosion due to subsequent and unanticipated changes in non-contracted policies. Staiger and Sykes show that, in ruling out discriminatory and unnecessarily trade restrictive regulatory choices, such an agreement would induce governments to unilaterally remove protectionist elements from their regulations in the service sector and divert these elements into a narrow set of scal \u0096but not regulatory \u0096measures. And with international pol- icy ine\u00a2 ciencies concentrated in a limited set of instruments, governments could then in a second step use negotiations over these instruments to establish (in con- cert with the NT, TBT and NV rules) e\u00a2 cient market access commitments in service sectors, without the need to directly negotiate over a wide range of do- mestic regulatory measures, much as GATT has used negotiated commitments on tari\u00a4s in the goods sector. As Staiger and Sykes argue, this approach to integra- tion of services trade might allow countries to side-step the di\u00a2 cult sovereignty issues that arise with deep integration e\u00a4orts, and which may help explain the relative lack of GATS\u0092 s success to date as compared to GATT. The purpose of GATS in a digital world As should be clear from the dis- cussion above, the property of the pre-digital world that Staiger and Sykes (2021) establish and that underpins the possibility of a shallow-integration approach to liberalization in the service sector is this: the problem for a trade-in-services agree- ment to solve is not so di\u00a4erent from the problem that a trade-in-goods agreement must solve, and but for the missing tari\u00a4 on mode 3services the two problems would be identical. In Staiger (2021) I show that this property extends to a digital world, and thereby establish that in the digital world the possibility of a shallow- integration approach to liberalization in the service sector exists, just as Staiger and Sykes describe that possibility for the pre-digital world. Moreover, I show that all of the conclusions reached in section 9.3 for the case of digital trade in goods in the presence of a cross-border non-pecuniary externality from digital openness carry over to the case of digital trade in services as well. In particular, as I noted in section 9.3 was the case for digital trade 183in goods, in the presence of a cross-border non-pecuniary externality from digital openness there are now two problems to solve for the case of digital services trade: the cross-border non-pecuniary externality must be addressed; and conditional on addressing this rst problem, the insu\u00a2 cient market access problem familiar from the pre-digital world must also be addressed. But as I also noted in section 9.3, even in this case there may be an approach to integration that lies somewhere between shallow integration on the one hand, and on the other hand fully deep integration where countries negotiate over all aspects of digital policy. 9.5. Digital Trade and the Design of the WTO What does the analysis presented in this chapter mean for the design of the WTO in a world of digital trade? The main message is in two parts. First, if the non-pecuniary externalities associated with open digital policies are purely local, then the purpose of a trade agreement in a digitalized world is to achieve an e\u00a2 cient level of market access, the same purpose as in the pre-digital world. And for this purpose, shallow integration can in principle su\u00a2 ce.131 Of course, in the analysis above I have abstracted from a number of challenges that a shallow approach to integration would confront in practice;132and in reality the line between shallow and deep integration is not as stark as my analysis makes it out to be. At a more practical level, therefore, and as I emphasized earlier, the message in this case is not so much that nodegree of deep integration is necessary in a digital world, but rather that the existing market access orientation of the WTO can provide a potentially useful guardrail to delineate the \u0093depth\u0094 of integration that trade agreements should contemplate in the digital world: according to the ndings above, and just as in the pre-digital world, there is no reason for a trade agreement in the world of digital trade to go deeper than what is required to ensure that property rights over negotiated market access are reasonably secure. The use of such a guardrail could help governments avoid con\u0087 icts between globalization and national sovereignty that, according to the analysis presented above, would be unnecessary.133 131Interestingly, adopting a very di\u00a4erent modeling approach that features monopoly platforms and two-sided markets for platform services and focuses on the particular issue of privacy pro- tection, McCalman (2021) comes to a similar conclusion that shallow integration may su\u00a2 ce for issues related to digital trade. 132See Staiger and Sykes (2021) for a discussion of a number of these challenges in the context of a shallow-integration approach to the liberalization of trade in services. 133Though it should be noted that I am abstracting from certain non-trade issues, such as the 184Even in this case, the analysis above suggests that the rise of digital trade could pose a challenge for the WTO, because it has the potential to disrupt the market access implications of existing WTO commitments. For example, while a good delivered via instructions for 3D printing is still a good according to my taxonomy, it may be that as a practical matter the tari\u00a4 commitments negotiated in the pre-digital world no longer a\u00a4ord the same protection against imports that they once did; and it may also be that new digital forms of protection become relevant which could undermine existing market access commitments. But at least in principle, existing WTO rules are well designed to handle these issues, because these issues are not new to the digital age. The rst of these issues could be handled under the various renegotiation clauses that exist in the WTO, which as I noted in chapter 7 are designed to allow WTO market access commitments to function as liability rules that can be renegotiated without fear of hold up from trading partners.134And the second issue can in principle be addressed with the existing WTO rules (e.g., NT, TBT, NV) that are designed to handle such issues more broadly. There is also an interesting further implication of the analysis above when the non-pecuniary externalities associated with open digital policies are purely local: the existing moratorium on tari\u00a4s on electronic transmissions might be complicat- ingthe task of shallow integration in a world of digital trade. This is because, as the analysis above demonstrates, it is only when the use of tari\u00a4s on digital trade is constrained that non-tari\u00a4 behind-the-border policies become distorted for pro- tectionist terms-of-trade-manipulation purposes. Viewed from this perspective, in the case where the non-pecuniary externalities associated with open digital poli- cies are purely local, the suspension or termination of the moratorium on tari\u00a4s on electronic transmissions should have the e\u00a4ect of inducing governments uni- laterally to concentrate their protective and internationally ine\u00a2 cient measures on such trade into tari\u00a4s, and in inducing such \u0093tari\u00a2 cation\u0094might represent a useful rst step toward e\u00a4ective shallow integration in a digital world. A nal pair of observations that apply to this rst case are also relevant. First, even if the purpose of a trade agreement does not change with the rise of digital trade, the blurring of the distinction between goods and services that digitalization has caused and will increasingly cause in the future presents an right to free speech, that may be particularly salient in this context; see, e.g., Meltzer (2013). 134In the context of the WTO, renegotiations of market access commitments for services are handled through GATS Article XXI, while as I noted earlier for goods they are handled through GATT Article XXVIII. 185important challenge for the WTO in light of the very di\u00a4erent structure of GATT and GATS. This challenge can be reduced if the design features of GATT and GATS are brought closer together, since then the distinction between goods and services becomes less consequential within the WTO legal framework. As I have described above, in principle GATS could be redesigned to be more like GATT. The advent of the digital age may make such a redesign all the more attractive. At the same time, the analysis in this chapter also suggests a second, related observation: from a functional perspective, a new approach to the classi cation of goods and services for the digital world might be attractive. Recall that I have adopted a simple taxonomy that partitions digital trade transactions into two groups: digital trade in goods, and digital trade in services; and to develop this taxonomy I have de ned a transaction as involving a good (service) if at the moment of consumption that transaction is a good (service) as traditionally de ned. And as I noted, for the formal analysis I have assumed that digitalization does not itself alter the feasibility of imposing a tari\u00a4 on the trade in question. My analysis, however, con rms for the digital world what the analysis of Staiger and Sykes (2021) implies for the pre-digital world, namely, that when it comes to the design features of a trade agreement what functionally distinguishes trade in goods from trade in services is whether or not a tari\u00a4 can be feasibly applied to that trade. This suggests the attractiveness of adopting an alternative classi cation system for traded goods and services within the context of the WTO: simply put, digital or otherwise, traded goods would refer to transactions on which a tari\u00a4 can feasibly be applied, and these transactions would be covered under GATT; traded services would refer to all other transactions, and these transactions would be governed under GATS.135Under this alternative classi cation, digitalization would change a good into a service or vice versa if and only if it altered the feasibility of imposing tari\u00a4s on the international transaction. The second part of the message applies where the non-pecuniary externalities associated with open digital policies cross national borders. As I have noted, in this case the purpose of a trade agreement becomes more complex, as there are now two problems to solve: the cross-border non-pecuniary externality must be 135This alternative classi cation adopts a functional perspective in the sense that it is based on the answer to the question \u0093Can a tari\u00a4 be applied to the transaction?\u0094 ; see Wille- myns (2019) for a discussion of alternative functional and other approaches to the classi- cation of services in the WTO. It should also be noted that the alternative classi cation I describe here would not necessarily conform to the principal of \u0093technological neutrality\u0094 that currently applies to GATS commitments (see the WTO Analytical Index Annex 1B at https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/publications_e/ai17_e/gats_art1_jur.pdf. 186addressed; and conditional on addressing this rst problem, the insu\u00a2 cient market access problem familiar from the pre-digital world must also be addressed. But I also emphasized a further point: even in this case, there may be an approach to integration for goods and services trade in a digital world that lies somewhere between GATT\u0092 s shallow integration approach on the one hand, and on the other hand fully deep integration where countries negotiate over all aspects of digital policy. This is because if countries could jointly focus on just those aspects of their digital openness that are generating the cross\u0096 border non-pecuniary exter- nalities and address those externalities with limited negotiations, then, from that point forward, we would be back in a world where there are no (unaddressed) cross-border non-pecuniary externalities and where only local non-pecuniary ex- ternalities remain; and that is a world where achieving the e\u00a2 ciency frontier with GATT\u0092 s shallow approach to integration is possible. To illustrate this point, I now brie\u0087 y describe a middle ground between shallow and deep integration in the context of the \u0093data de-correlation\u0094scheme proposed by Acemoglu et al (forthcoming). Acemoglu et al consider a situation in which users of a digital platform value privacy to varying degrees and impose negative externalities on each other when they share their personal data with the platform, provided that their data is correlated with other users so that the platform also learns something about other users through this correlation. In such a situation, individual-level data is underpriced and the market economy generates too much data. As Acemoglu et al describe, data de-correlation represents one possible solution to address this problem. De-correlation is a scheme for mediating (via a trusted third party) data transactions in a way that reduces their correlation with the data of other users \u0096and in particular the correlation between the data of a user who is not sharing her data with the data of others who have shared their data \u0096and thereby mitigates these externality-induced privacy concerns.136 In the context of the present discussion, we could think of WTO member governments agreeing to a limited form of this proposal, tailored to address just the correlation with the data of other international users \u0096and hence addressing just the cross-border non-pecuniary externality associated with these digital privacy issues \u0096 and leaving the handling of correlation of users\u0092 data within national borders to the discretion of each national government. In this way, users of the 136As Acemoglu et al (forthcoming) discuss, the de-correlation scheme that they propose is di\u00a4erent from procedures which anonymize data, because the latter hides information about the user who is sharing her data while the former only hides information about others who are correlated with this user. 187digital platform would retain private property rights over their own cross-border data \u0087 ows and thereby avoid the associated cross-border non-pecuniary externality that would otherwise arise, and such property rights might be protected within the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS); but whether or not users retained such rights over their own within- country data \u0087 ows would be a decision for each national government to make. Finally, it should be emphasized that I have taken a reduced-form approach to modeling the impact of digitalization on the world economy, and in doing so I have abstracted from many important features of digital trade and digital policies. If modeled, a number of these features would introduce potentially important departures from the simple competitive industry environment that I have adopted for my formal analysis, and it is possible that such departures could alter my ndings. As I noted earlier, the terms-of-trade theory of trade agreements has been shown to yield robust ndings across a wide range of market structures, and I suspect that my ndings here will prove fairly robust as well. Still, it is important to move beyond the reduced-form approach I have adopted and investigate the impacts of digitalization on the purpose of a trade agreement in micro-founded models of digital trade. In this regard, Antras and Staiger (2012a, 2012b) have shown that the terms-of-trade theory does not extend to \u0093o\u00a4shoring\u0094settings with the characteristic that domestic and foreign buyers exchange specialized inputs whose prices are determined by bilateral bargaining and are not disciplined by industry-wide market clearing conditions.137I discuss the challenge that o\u00a4shoring that exhibits this characteristic may pose for the WTO in chapter 10. But to the extent that digital trade, and especially digital trade in services along a global value chain, is also thought to exhibit this characteristic, an important caveat to the results I have derived here should be kept in mind. 10. The Rise of O\u00a4shoring and Global Value Chains The rise of o\u00a4shoring \u0096the sourcing of intermediate inputs from foreign suppliers \u0096and the creation of global value chains (GVCs) in production has been a de ning feature of globalization over the past three decades. This is illustrated in Figure 10.1, which is reproduced from the 2020 World Development report (World Bank, 137Further quali cations to the case for shallow integration arise in the setting analyzed by Grossman, McCalman and Staiger (2021). I discuss their ndings in detail in chapter 11. See also Bagwell, Bown and Staiger (2016) for a review of other modeling frameworks where the shallow-integration results of the terms-of-trade theory need not hold. 1882020, Figure 1.2) and shows the GVC share of global trade holding steady at around 40%through the 1970\u0092 s and 80\u0092 s, and then rising sharply in the 1990\u0092 s to a peak on the eve of the 2008 nancial crisis before leveling o\u00a4 at around 50%. Figure 10.1 (Reproduced from World Bank, 2020) Does o\u00a4shoring create new problems of global policy cooperation whose so- lutions require international agreements with novel features? In this chapter I discuss the answer to this question that is provided by Antras and Staiger (2012a, 2012b). They show that if o\u00a4shoring can be seen as changing the nature of the dominant form of international price determination, from a process governed by a standard market-clearing mechanism to one that is described by a collection of bilateral bargains between specialized foreign suppliers and their domestic buy- ers, then the rise in o\u00a4shoring will have changed the nature of the dominant international policy externality, and it will as a consequence create the need for fundamental changes in the WTO\u0092 s approach to trade liberalization. In particu- lar, Antras and Staiger argue that the rise of o\u00a4shoring may make it increasingly di\u00a2 cult for governments to rely on the traditional GATT/WTO concepts and rules \u0096such as market access, reciprocity and non-discrimination \u0096that have un- derpinned the GATT/WTO shallow integration approach as I have described that approach in previous chapters. I focus in this chapter on the potential implications of o\u00a4shoring for the choice between shallow and deep integration. To illustrate the ndings of Antras and Staiger (2012a, 2012b), I consider below a model that features trade in an \u0093o\u00a4shored\u0094input, the building block of GVCs. To make the key points emphasized by Antras and Staiger, I present two versions of this o\u00a4shoring model. In a rst version, the input is standardized and its price is determined by an international market clearing condition. In this version I 189con rm that the purpose of a trade agreement is unchanged by the introduction of o\u00a4shoring and that the logical basis of a shallow approach to integration remains intact, and hence that o\u00a4shoring per se poses no challenge to the GATT/WTO design. In a second version of the o\u00a4shoring model, I assume that the input is specialized and that its price is determined by bilateral bargaining between buyer and seller. It is in this version of the o\u00a4shoring model that I demonstrate the di\u00a2 culty that a shallow approach to integration would face. I then o\u00a4er an assessment of the implications of these ndings for the treatment of behind-the- border policies in trade agreements when o\u00a4shoring is present, and for the e\u00a2 cacy of the GATT/WTO shallow approach to integration in an o\u00a4shoring world.138 10.1. GVCs and deep integration I consider a very stylized two-country partial equilibrium setting to illustrate the key points developed by Antras and Staiger (2012a, 2012b). A nal good yis consumed only in the home country, which is also the only country that can produce it. Home-country demand for good yis given by the downward sloping demand curve D(py), wherepyis the price of good yfaced by domestic consumers. There are two technologies available in the home country for good- yproduc- tion. One technology is linear in the numeraire, and I assume that units of yhave been chosen so that one unit of the numeraire produces one unit of good y. This technology is available to any producer in the home country who would like to use it, ensuring that there is a \u0093competitive fringe\u0094of in nitely elastic supply of goodyat a home-country consumer price of 1. Provided that supply from the home-country competitive fringe is strictly positive, which I will assume to be the case, the home-country consumer price of good yis then pinned down at 1, and home-country demand for good yis xed atD(1). The other technology is owned by a single home-country rm and requires an inputxthat is produced only in the foreign country: this is the \u0093o\u00a4shoring\u0094 technology, which I represent with the increasing and concave function fy(x). I consider two cases for the good- yo\u00a4shoring technology, and for the structure of the foreign x-producing industry that is implied. In a rst case, I assume that 138As Antras and Staiger (2012b) emphasize, the key feature of the economy needed for results of the kind I describe below is that international prices are determined by bilateral bargaining, and the rise of o\u00a4shoring is one plausible way in which this method of price determination may have become increasingly prominent in recent decades. Also, in the model below I follow Antras and Staiger and abstract from international factor ownership and the presence of multinational rms (but see Blanchard, 2010, and the discussion in Bagwell and Staiger, 2016, pp 497-499). 190the o\u00a4shoring technology requires a standardized input, and that the input can be sourced from any rm in a competitive foreign x-producing industry. In this case, the price at which the input is exchanged between the single o\u00a4shoring home rm and the competitive foreign exporting industry is determined by a standard international market clearing condition. In a second case, I assume that the input xrequired by the o\u00a4shoring home rm is highly specialized and must be sourced from a single specialized foreign supplier. In this case, the price at which the input is exchanged between the single o\u00a4shoring home rm and the single foreign supplier is then determined by bilateral bargaining between the parties. In terms of policy instruments, I assume that the foreign-country government is passive, but the home-country government has two tax instruments.139First, the home-country government has a production tax ty(de ned in speci c terms, negative if a subsidy) at its disposal that it can impose on the good- yproduction of the home-country o\u00a4shoring rm, leaving the production of the competitive fringe untaxed. And second, the home-country government has a good- ximport tari\u00a4 x(de ned in speci c terms, negative if a subsidy) at its disposal, implying that the relationship between the home-country price of x,px, and the foreign country price of x,p\u0003 x, is given by px=p\u0003 x+ x. With the foreign government assumed passive in this industry, the foreign price p\u0003 xis also the \u0093world\u0094(untaxed) price ofxand hence the terms of trade between the two countries. International input price determined by market clearing I begin with the case where the input xis standardized and is produced by a competitive foreign industry of suppliers. I represent the foreign industry supply curve of the inputxby the upward sloping function S\u0003 x(p\u0003 x). In this case, as I noted above, the price at which the input xis exchanged between the single o\u00a4shoring home rm and the competitive foreign industry of input suppliers is determined by a standard international market clearing condition. Speci cally, and denoting as Dm xthe o\u00a4shoring home rm\u0092 s derived demand for the input x, the international x-market clearing condition is given by S\u0003 x(p\u0003 x) =Dm x (10.1) and de nes the market clearing world price of xas a function of Dm x, ~p\u0003 x=S\u0003\u00001 2012b) consider the case where both home and foreign countries are policy active. 191As is intuitive, (10.2) implies that a higher derived demand Dm xfor the input x leads to a higher world price of xand, through the pricing relationship px=p\u0003 x+ x, leads also to a higher input price paid by the o\u00a4shoring home rm, re\u0087 ecting its monopsony power on world markets. Given that the o\u00a4shoring home rm is a price-taker in its output market and receives 1\u0000tyfor each unit of ythat it produces, the problem it faces is simple: its only decision is how much xto import from the foreign country in order to optimally exploit its monopsony power. Facing the tari\u00a4 on imported inputs x, the o\u00a4shoring home rm\u0092 s derived demand for xsolves x(Dm x) + x)\u0002Dm x: The rst-order condition equates marginal revenue to marginal cost and implies Dm x=Dm x((\u0000) x;(\u0000) ty) (10.3) as is intuitive, according to (10.4) the world price of the input xis decreasing in the home tari\u00a4 on imported inputs xand decreasing as well in the home production tax on its o\u00a4shoring rm ty, because both of these taxes reduce the derived demand for imported inputs. I can now de ne welfare for the home and foreign countries. I begin with home-country welfare. To this end, I rst use (10.3) and (10.4) to de ne the optimized pro ts of the o\u00a4shoring home rm as a function of the taxes it faces: \u0019( x;ty)\u0011(1\u0000ty)\u0002fy(Dm x( x;ty))\u0000(~p\u0003 x( x;ty) + x)\u0002Dm x( x;ty): Home country welfare then consists of the sum of consumer surplus, CS(1), which is xed, the pro ts of the o\u00a4shoring home rm, \u0019( x;ty), and net x( x;ty)\u0011W( x;ty): Foreign country welfare is composed only of the producer surplus of foreign producers of the input x, which is de ned by PS\u0003 de ned as W\u0003=PS\u0003 x( x;ty)\u0011W\u0003( x;ty): (10.6) I am now ready to characterize e\u00a2 cient and non-cooperative (Nash) policies in a world of o\u00a4shoring, but where international prices continue to be determined by international market clearing conditions (i.e., where ~p\u0003 xis determined by (10.1)).140 As usual, I will de ne e\u00a2 cient policies as those that maximize \u0093world\u0094 welfare (i.e., the sum of home and foreign welfare) Ww\u0011W+W\u0003. The two rst-order conditions that must hold at The two rst-order conditions hold at the Nash choices of xandtyare @W( x;ty) @ x= 0 (10.8) the expressions for W( x;ty)andW\u0003( x;ty)in (10.5) and (10.6), re- spectively, it is direct to establish that the e\u00a2 ciency conditions in (10.7) imply that the e\u00a2 cient policies, which I denote by e xandte y, satisfy ~p\u0003 x( e x;te y) f0 y(Dm x( e x;te y))= 1: (10.9) The condition in (10.9) has an intuitive interpretation. The expression on the left-hand side is the marginal cost of the last unit of yproduced by the o\u00a4shoring home rm, where the cost of the input xis valued at the world price ~p\u0003 x( e x;te y). And the right-hand side is simply the consumer price of yin the home country (which recall is xed at 1). Hence, (10.9) says that for e\u00a2 ciency xandtymust be set to correct the monopsony distortion of the home o\u00a4shoring rm, so that it 140Here and throughout this chapter I will refer to the non-cooperative choices as \u0093Nash\u0094 policies, even though I have assumed that the foreign government is passive, which implies that these policies are simply the unilateral non-cooperative choices of the home government. 193imports the input xto the point where its marginal cost of yproduction valued at world prices equals the consumer price of y. Since by design in the simple model of o\u00a4shoring that I have constructed the policies xandtydo not impact consumer decisions, they are both instruments that only impact the producer margin, and hence any combination of xandtythat satis es (10.9) is e\u00a2 cient. To evaluate the e\u00a2 ciency properties of the Nash policy choices characterized in (10.8), I rst rewrite the e\u00a2 ciency conditions of (10.7) in the equivalent dtyjdDmx=0denotes the change in xwhich, when accompanied by a small increase in ty, will hold the import volume Dm x( x;ty) xed. The e\u00a2 ciency condi- tions in (10.10) are equivalent to those in (10.7), because the novel second term in the second line of (10.10) is zero at e\u00a2 cient policies by the rst line of (10.10). But notice from (10.4) \u0096 which follows from the international market clearing condition (10.1) \u0096that changes to xandtythat holdDm x( x;ty) xed also hold xed ~p\u0003 x( e x;te y), and hence by (10.6) hold xed W\u0003( x;ty). That is, @W\u0003( x;ty) @ty+@W\u0003( x;ty) @ xd x dtyjdDmx=0= 0; (10.11) to 0: The e\u00a2 ciency conditions in (10.12) are analogous to those derived by Bagwell and Staiger (2001b) for the case of tari\u00a4s and domestic standards in a competitive general equilibrium setting, as I described those conditions in chapter 3, and they have an analogous interpretation. The bottom condition in (10.12) can be viewed as the \u0093domestic\u0094e\u00a2 ciency condition, as it ensures that the domestic mix of policies that delivers a given trade volume is chosen e\u00a2 ciently. And the top condition in (10.12) can then be viewed as the \u0093international\u0094e\u00a2 ciency condition that assures that the volume of trade is also e\u00a2 cient. 194It is now direct to see from a comparison of the Nash conditions in (10.8) that Nash policies violate the international e\u00a2 ciency condition in the top line of (10.12) with tari\u00a4s that are too high, but Nash policies satisfy the domestic e\u00a2 ciency condition in the bottom line of (10.12).141The nature of the Nash ine\u00a2 ciency is therefore familiar from earlier chapters: there is one problem for a trade agreement to solve, and that is the problem of insu\u00a2 cient market access. Hence, o\u00a4shoring per se does not alter the purpose of a trade agreement, at least not when o\u00a4shoring involves standardized inputs and international prices continue to be determined by market clearing conditions.142And as I noted in chapter 3, it is the structure of the market access problem that needs to be solved as re\u0087 ected here in (10.8) and (10.12) that facilitates the possibility of shallow in- tegration \u0096a focus on negotiated tari\u00a4 liberalization, with vation rules\u0094to prevent the reemergence of terms-of-trade manipulation through the introduction of new distortions in behind-the-border measures \u0096as an e\u00a2 cient solution. I next ask whether this conclusion survives when o\u00a4shoring involves a specialized input and international prices are determined by bilateral bargaining. International input price determined by bilateral bargaining I now as- sume that the input xrequired by the home o\u00a4shoring rm is highly specialized and cannot be sourced from a competitive industry of foreign suppliers. I fo- cus on a single foreign producer of x, where the input xis exchanged between the o\u00a4shoring home rm and this single foreign input supplier at a price that is determined by bilateral bargaining between the parties. More speci cally, I follow Antras and Staiger (2012a, 2012b) and adopt an incomplete contracts setting where, to make a sale to the o\u00a4shoring home rm, the foreign supplier must rst invest in production and then (symmetric Nash) bargain over the price \u0096the international price \u0096at which it sells its produced inputs to the home rm. I take the input to be specialized for use by the o\u00a4shoring home rm and worthless if not sold to this rm, and I assume that the o\u00a4shoring home rm has no alternative source of input supply: hence the outside option of 141More speci cally, conditions (10.8) and (10.12) imply that the Nash tari\u00a4 is too high given the Nash production tax. This can be seen by noting that, with N xandtN ydenoting Nash taxes, the top line of (10.8) implies@W( N x;tN y) @ x= 0and therefore at Nash taxes the top line of (10.12) is violated with@[W( N x;tN y)+W\u0003( N x;tN y)] @ y) @ x<0implying that the Nash tari\u00a4 is too high given the Nash production tax. 142If this were not the case, the terms-of-trade theory would face a serious limitation, since input trade itself is not new. What is new is the highly specialized nature of that trade. 195both the o\u00a4shoring home rm and its foreign supplier is zero. I also now assume that the unit cost of foreign production is a constant c\u0003. The decisions of the o\u00a4shoring home rm and its foreign supplier imply an import quantity Mxthat then determines the level of yproduced by the o\u00a4shoring home rm according to the production function fy(Mx). As should come as no surprise, in this setting there is a hold-up problem that leads to under-supply of the input, because the foreign input supplier is unable to capture all the surplus from its marginal supply decision, and an e\u00a2 ciency role for tax/tari\u00a4 intervention arises as a result. The question is how non-cooperative policy choices diverge from these e\u00a2 cient choices. The structure of the bilateral buyer-seller relationship can be formalized in a three-stage game. I assume that all government policies are xed in advance of the start of this game, which is then captured in the following sequence of events: stage 1. The foreign supplier decides on the amount Mxto be produced (at marginal cost of c\u0003). stage 2. The foreign supplier and the home o\u00a4shoring rm (symmetric Nash) bargain over the price at which the input will change hands. Failure to reach agreement leaves both partners with their zero outside option. stage 3. The home o\u00a4shoring rm imports the quantity Mxfrom the foreign supplier, payments agreed in stage 2are settled, and the home o\u00a4shoring rm produces fy(Mx)units of good yand sells its yproduction to domestic consumers at the consumer price of 1(with the tari\u00a4 xand production tax tycollected at the time of importation and production, respectively). Consider the subgame perfect equilibrium of the 3-stage game outlined above. First, if the o\u00a4shoring home rm and its foreign supplier reach agreement in stage 2, the home rm can produce fy(Mx)units of good yfor sale in the home-country market and make net-of-tax/tari\u00a4 revenues in the amount of [(1\u0000ty)\u0002fy(Mx)\u0000 xMx], whereas disagreement in stage 2 results in both parties receiving their outside option of zero. Hence, given the quantity of inputs Mxit follows that in the symmetric Nash bargain of stage 2 the o\u00a4shoring home rm and the foreign supplier split the bargaining surplus and each receives1 2[(1\u0000ty)\u0002fy(Mx)\u0000 xMx]. For the home o\u00a4shoring rm, its share of the bargaining surplus is also its pro ts, and I record these pro ts (conditional on distinguish the o\u00a4shoring home rm\u0092 s pro t function here from its pro t function \u0019de ned in the previous version of the o\u00a4shoring model that I presented above. Now consider the foreign supplier\u0092 s output choice in stage 1. Recalling that the unit cost of production for the foreign supplier is c\u0003, the foreign supplier chooses Mxto maximize its pro ts, which are given by \u0005\u0003(Mx; x;ty) =1 2[(1\u0000ty)\u0002fy(Mx)\u0000 xMx]\u0000c\u0003Mx: (10.14) Using (10.14), the level of Mxchosen by the foreign supplier in stage 1 is then implicitly de ned by the rst order condition 1 2(1\u0000ty)\u0002f0 y(Mx)\u0000( x 2+c\u0003) = 0; (10.15) where the rst term in (10.15) is the foreign supplier\u0092 s share of the marginal revenue from producing another unit of xand the second term is the foreign supplier\u0092 s share of the marginal (delivered) cost. With the rst-order condition in (10.15) implicitly de ning the foreign input supplier\u0092 s stage-1 choice Mx( x;ty), (10.13) and (10.14) can then be used to de ne home- and foreign- rm pro ts as a function of the tari\u00a4/tax policies foreign-country welfare may be de ned respectively and Nash tax/tari\u00a4 policies again must satisfy the rst order con- ditions speci ed in (10.7) and (10.8), respectively, the same rst order conditions that applied in the previous version of the o\u00a4shoring model, where o\u00a4shoring in- volved standardized inputs and international prices were determined by market 197clearing conditions. For ease of reference, I reproduce these conditions here. The two rst-order conditions that must hold at the e\u00a2 rst-order hold at the Nash choices of xandtyare @W( x;ty) @ x= 0 where these sets of rst-order conditions are now evaluated with the home-country and foreign-country welfare functions given in (10.16) and (10.17) respectively. It is straightforward to show that the e\u00a2 ciency conditions in (10.18) describe tar- i\u00a4/tax intervention that encourages the production of the input xand corrects the under-supply created by the hold-up problem. But with these welfare functions, the di\u00a4erence between the Nash and e\u00a2 cient policies is now more complex than was the case in the previous version of the o\u00a4shoring model presented above. To show this, I proceed as before and rst rewrite the e\u00a2 ciency conditions of (10.18) in the dtyjdDmx=0denotes the change in xwhich, when accompanied by a small increase inty, will hold the import volume Mx( x;ty) xed. But recall that, rather than an international market clearing condition, in this version of the o\u00a4shoring model it is the rst-order condition in (10.15) which de nes Mx( x;ty). And using (10.15) it follows thatd x dtyjdMx=0=\u0000f0 implies by turn allows me in where the term on the right-hand side of the bottom line of (10.21) is positive given the concavity of fy(Mx). It is now direct to see from a comparison of the Nash conditions in (10.19) that Nash policies violate the international e\u00a2 ciency condition in the top line of (10.21), with tari\u00a4s that are too high, just as I showed was the case in the previous version of the o\u00a4shoring model where o\u00a4shoring involved standardized inputs and international prices were determined by market clearing conditions. But now the Nash policies also violate the domestic e\u00a2 ciency condition in the bottom line of (10.12), with production taxes that are too high. More speci cally, the top lines of conditions (10.19) and (10.21) imply that the Nash tari\u00a4 is too high given the Nash production tax: evaluated at the Nash policies, the left-hand side of the top line of (10.21) (which is negative) is less than the right-hand side (zero). Similarly, the bottom lines of conditions (10.19) and (10.21) imply that the Nash production tax is too high given the Nash tari\u00a4: evaluated at the Nash policies, the left-hand side of the bottom line of (10.21) (which is zero) is less than the right-hand side (which is positive). The nature of the Nash ine\u00a2 ciency is therefore di\u00a4erent from that described in the previous ver- sion of the o\u00a4shoring model: when international prices are determined by bilateral bargaining rather than a market clearing condition, there is an insu\u00a2 cient market access problem associated with tari\u00a4s that are too high, but there is also now an additional ine\u00a2 ciency that involves the setting of behind-the-border measures.143 This di\u00a4erence has important implications for the e\u00a2 cacy of shallow inte- gration in such a world. An immediate implication is that behind-the-border measures will be distorted in the Nash equilibrium, and so the logic of shallow in- tegration, with its focus on negotiated tari\u00a4 liberalization combined with market 143In fact, Antras and Staiger (2012a) establish formally that, despite the di\u00a4erence that I have emphasized in the text, when political economy motivations are absent (as is the case in the simple model I have developed here) the problem for a trade agreement to solve in the presence of o\u00a4shoring can still be given a terms-of-trade interpretation, even when inputs are specialized and international prices are determined by bilateral bargaining. However, they also show that this interpretation no longer applies once political economy motives are introduced. 199access preservation rules to prevent the reemergence of terms-of-trade manipula- tion through the introduction of new distortions in behind-the-border measures, no longer provides a coherent path to internationally e\u00a2 cient policies. Moreover, a market access preservation rule cannot stop terms-of-trade manipulation in this setting, because the nature of the international policy externalities has changed. To show this last point, I now consider the equilibrium world (untaxed) price at which the input xis exchanged between the foreign input supplier and the home o\u00a4shoring rm, which I denote by ^p\u0003 x. This is simply the total revenue received by the foreign supplier divided by the quantity of inputs that are exchanged, or ^p\u0003 x\u00111 2[(1\u0000ty)\u0002fy(Mx) Mx\u0000 x]: (10.22) Using the de the world price of inputs ^p\u0003 xin (10.22), which is also the terms of trade between the home and foreign country, it follows that @^p\u0003 x @ty+@^p\u0003 x @ xd x dtyjdMx=0=\u00001 2[fy(Mx) Mx\u0000f0 y(Mx)]<0: (10.23) As (10.23) con rms, country can reduce ^p\u0003 xand improve its terms-of- trade by raising its production tax tyeven as it lowers its tari\u00a4 xto preserve the equilibrium import volume Mx( x;ty). Evidently, even subject to a market access preservation rule that had the e\u00a4ect of preventing changes in behind-the-border measures that altered the volume of trade, the home country can still engage in terms-of-trade manipulation when o\u00a4shoring involves a specialized input and international prices are determined by bilateral bargaining.144 10.2. What the rise of GVCs means for the design of trade agreements If the rise of o\u00a4shoring is indeed changing the nature of international price deter- mination and the implied international policy externalities in the way I have just described, then GATT/WTO rules will be relatively poorly suited for liberalizing tari\u00a4s on the customized inputs that form the bulk of GVC trade, and we might expect to observe that WTO members are less successful in negotiating tari\u00a4 cuts 144Antras and Staiger (2012a) consider several interpretations of a market access preservation rule, including the one I consider here that amounts to preserving trade volume, and also a more expansive one that amounts to preserving both the trade volume and the world price. As they demonstrate, while the former would allow too much policy \u0087 exibility, the latter allows too little, and neither would allow shallow integration to achieve the e\u00a2 ciency frontier in this setting. 200for this kind of trade. Figure 10.2, reproduced from Antras and Staiger (2012a), provides some suggestive evidence in this regard. For a sample of 16countries that joined the WTO after its creation in 1995, Figure 10.2 shows that negotiated tari\u00a4 cuts were greater in sectors with low levels of input customization than they were in sectors with high levels of input customization, suggesting that countries have more di\u00a2 culty liberalizing trade through WTO negotiations in sectors where customized inputs are especially prevalent. While only suggestive, this evidence points to the possibility that the rise of o\u00a4shoring may indeed have altered (deepened) the kinds of rules needed to help countries address their international policy ine\u00a2 ciencies. Figure 10.2 (Reproduced from Antras and Staiger, 2012a) Further suggestive evidence is provided from another angle. As Antras and Staiger (2012a) observe, if o\u00a4shoring is causing a problem for the WTO, then WTO-member governments whose countries experience a rise in the importance of o\u00a4shoring might seek out alternative agreements with the countries in their GVCs as a way to achieve the deep integration that WTO commitments in their current form could not adequately provide. Laget et al (2019) provide evidence of this (see also Ore ce and Rocha, 2014). Focusing on the depth of preferential trade agreements (PTAs) that WTO members negotiate under the GATT Article XXIV exception to the MFN clause, Laget et al nd that the deepest PTAs were negotiated among countries with the greatest GVC-related trade. Figure 10.3, which is based on the results of Laget et al and reproduced from the 2020 World Development report (World Bank, 2020, Figure 9.9), depicts this relationship. In their econometric analysis, which employs a structural gravity model to estimate the relationship between cross-border production linkages and the depth of PTAs, 201Lagel et al nd that there is a positive impact of deep trade agreements on GVC integration, and that this impact is driven by trade in inputs rather than in nal goods and services. This is again suggestive of the possibility that countries might seek deep trade commitments that the WTO framework cannot provide in order to facilitate the trade in specialized inputs that dominate GVCs. Figure 10.3 (Reproduced from World Bank, 2020) It is possible, then, that the rise of o\u00a4shoring has introduced into the world trading system a novel form of international policy externality, at least among countries trading specialized inputs along a common GVC, and in doing so has made the shallow-integration approach of the GATT/WTO no longer well-designed to solve the fundamental trade agreement problem for these countries. If this is so, then deeper forms of integration will be required for these countries to achieve internationally e\u00a2 cient policies, and a stark trade-o\u00a4 between sovereignty and globalization may be unavoidable. But as I noted, the evidence that I have reviewed above is only suggestive of this possibility, and I am unaware of direct empirical evidence on what the nd- ings of Antras and Staiger (2012a, 2012b) indicate is the crucial question, namely, whether the recent rise in o\u00a4shoring has changed the nature of the dominant form of international price determination. And so it is also possible that the rise of o\u00a4shoring has notchanged the nature of the international policy externality (or has changed the nature of the policy externalities only temporarily, as o\u00a4shoring itself may have peaked, or possibly even be more of a transitory phenomenon). In light of these unknowns, building on the GATT/WTO foundation, rather than 202abandoning it, in an attempt to address those issues that arise with o\u00a4shoring while preserving the bene cial features of the GATT/WTO architecture for ad- dressing traditional international policy externalities, seems like the best course of action, at least until there is more direct empirical evidence that can be brought to bear on this question. Where, speci cally, does this leave us? As this discussion suggests, there is likely no easy answer for addressing the novel challenges that are posed by the rise of o\u00a4shoring, and there is still much that is unknown about these challenges. But as I will discuss further in chapter 13, a reasonable approach may be to encourage plurilateral agreements within the WTO framework that achieve deeper integra- tion among willing countries, but that do not contain preferential discriminatory tari\u00a4 commitments as is the case with PTAs.145 11. The Push Toward Regulatory Convergence In his 2015 Jan Tumlir Lecture, former WTO Director General Pascal Lamy em- phasized the growing importance of a particular form of international externality, di\u00a4erent from market access issues and arising instead from regulatory hetero- geneity across countries. Lamy argued that the focus of trade negotiations will increasingly be about achieving cost savings through harmonization, or at least convergence, in regulatory measures that are designed to protect consumers, reg- ulations that Lamy characterized as motivated by \u0093precaution.\u0094And he drew the following distinction between \u0093old\u0094and \u0093new\u0094trade agreements: What trade media tell us is that today\u0092 s trade theater is about two big shows, TPP and TTIP. What they do not tell you is that TPP is in many ways the last show of the old world of trade, and that TTIP is the rst show of the new world of trade. TPP is mostly, though not only, about classical protection related market access issues, which is why it will be concluded soon, likely with modest results. TTIP is mostly, though not only, about precaution relating to regulatory convergence. ... Because precaution is, at the end of the day, risk-related and thus value-related, it is much more politically sensitive because it makes legitimacy harder to build. (Lamy, 2015) 145As Bagwell and Staiger (1999, 2002) have shown and as further indicated by the discussion in chapters 4 and 5, the existence of preferential agreements involving discriminatory tari\u00a4 commitments present their own problems for the e\u00a4ectiveness of the GATT/WTO architecture. 203In e\u00a4ect, according to Lamy (2015) and also Lamy (2016), with traditional trade barriers now reduced to low levels, the protectionist motive for insulating producers from foreign competition is being replaced by the precautionary mo- tive for regulation designed to protect consumers\u0092health, safety and values. As a result, according to Lamy, trade agreements are becoming less about eliminating protective barriers and more about reducing di\u00a4erences between regulatory poli- cies that have legitimate aims, in pursuit of the cost savings that such regulatory harmonization implies. Yet Sykes (1999a, 1999b) points to a possible downside of regulatory harmonization. As Sykes observes, international di\u00a4erences in in- comes, cultures, risk preferences and tastes generally justify some degree of regu- latory heterogeneity, even if the added costs of satisfying a multitude of rules are also recognized. This raises the question of the appropriate balance between the reduction of regulatory di\u00a4erences across countries to lower the costs of serving multiple markets and the preservation of regulatory di\u00a4erences across countries to re\u0087 ect their heterogeneous tastes. And it raises the question of what role, if any, a trade agreement might play in helping countries achieve this balance, and how the agreement should be designed to serve that role. I have discussed the treatment of regulations in trade agreements in earlier chapters in the context of the terms-of-trade theory, but the terms-of-trade the- ory cannot take us very far in answering the questions posed just above, because according to that theory harmonizing regulations would be desirable only to the extent that it is needed to secure the property rights over negotiated market ac- cess, not as an end it itself. In this chapter I discuss the ndings of Grossman, McCalman and Staiger (2021), who propose a modelling framework that can pro- vide answers to these questions. In the model that Grossman, McCalman and Staiger develop, traditional mar- ket access/terms-of-trade manipulation concerns are put to the side, so that the distinct issues associated with regulatory harmonization as raised by Lamy (2015, 2016) and Sykes (1999a, 1999b) can be explored. Speci cally, in their model rms design products to appeal to local consumer tastes, which di\u00a4er across countries as Sykes emphasizes. But the rms\u0092 xed costs increase with the di\u00a4erences be- tween versions of their products destined for di\u00a4erent markets, and hence there are potential cost savings from regulatory harmonization as emphasized by Lamy. As I describe below, Grossman, McCalman and Staiger distinguish between two settings, one setting where there are no externalities associated with the con- sumption of products with di\u00a4erent attributes (e.g., chicken that has or has not been subject to chlorine wash), and the other setting where such consumption ex- 204ternalities are present but do not cross national borders (e.g., the safety features of cars on the road).146In the rst setting where consumption externalities are absent, they show that rms\u0092pro t-maximizing choices of product attributes are globally optimal, but national governments have unilateral incentives to invoke regulatory protectionism, not for purposes of terms-of-trade manipulation, but rather to induce rm \u0093delocation\u0094 \u0096 the entry of rms in the home market at the cost of rm exit abroad \u0096as in Venables (1987) and Ossa (2011). An e\u00a2 cient trade agreement will of course require commitments that prevent such opportunis- tic behavior, but in this rst setting Grossman, McCalman and Staiger show that shallow integration is still possible: a rule requiring mutual recognition of stan- dards can be used to achieve e\u00a2 ciency with shallow integration, though one that requires only national treatment as in the WTO falls short. By contrast, they show that in the second setting where product attributes confer local consump- tion externalities, a deeper approach to integration will be required to achieve e\u00a2 ciency, as in this second setting an e\u00a2 cient trade agreement must coordinate the ne details of countries\u0092regulatory policies.147 Below I sketch the model put forward by Grossman, McCalman and Staiger and describe their ndings. It is convenient to present the model as they develop it, rst in the absence of consumption externalities and then extended to include such externalities. I conclude the chapter with a discussion of what their ndings mean for the design of the WTO. 11.1. A model of regulatory heterogeneity and rm delocation To explore the tradeo\u00a4s associated with regulatory harmonization that are sug- gested by the considerations in Lamy (2015, 2016) and Sykes (1999a, 1999b), Grossman, McCalman and Staiger extend the model of trade in di\u00a4erentiated products due to Venables (1987) to allow for a second dimension of di\u00a4erentiation for each brand. It is along this second dimension of di\u00a4erentiation that countries 146As a general matter the role for international agreements to handle non-pecuniary exter- nalities that do cross national borders is already well understood. In chapters 8 and 9 I have discussed how such externalities might arise naturally in the speci c context of atmospheric car- bon and digital trade, respectively, and how the design of trade agreements might be adjusted in the presence of these externalities. 147Grossman, McCalman and Staiger refer to \u0093new\u0094versus \u0093old\u0094trade agreements rather than \u0093deep\u0094 versus \u0093shallow,\u0094 in order to connect with Lamy\u0092 s (2015, 2016) terminology as quoted above and to re\u0087 ect the particular focus on regulatory heterogeneity that their paper adopts. In describing their work here I maintain the terminology of deep versus shallow agreements that I have used throughout the book. 205are assumed to have \u0093collective preferences,\u0094 the term used by Lamy (2016) to refer to valuations that re\u0087 ect countries\u0092idiosyncratic local conditions, incomes, and cultures. And it is when a rm caters to each country\u0092 s collective preferences with multiple versions of a brand \u0096either by its own pro t-maximizing calcula- tions or in order to conform to distinct regulatory standards in each market \u0096that its xed cost of serving multiple markets is assumed to rise. In particular, representing the utility of the NJidentical consumers in country J2fH;Fgwith the countryJand Dis a sub-utility index for per-capita consumption of di\u00a4erentiated products, Grossman, McCalman and Staiger assume that the goods in the bundle CJ Dbear two distinct characteristics. One characteristic makes each brand unique and ensures that every pair of brands is a CES-substitute, with an elasticity of substi- tution greater than one so that consumers prefer variety. The other characteristic of a brand determines the local evaluation of the version of the brand sold in each country. This second characteristic is captured with the parameter aJ i, which po- sitions the variant of brand isold in country Jalong some nite segment of the real line, [amin;amax]. WithcJ idenoting the representative \u0002J represents the set of brands available in country J. The function A\u0000 aJ i; J\u0001 is J\u0001 <0for allaJ iand J. According to the formulation in (11.2), AJ i\u0011A\u0000 aJ i; J\u0001 acts as a \u0093demand shifter,\u0094where Jis a parameter describing the local economic or social conditions in country J that are relevant for evaluation of the good. And as Grossman, McCalman and Staiger describe, this formulation is general enough to be consistent with both horizontal and vertical di\u00a4erentiation of the di\u00a4erent versions of brand i. Maximizing the utility in (11.1) subject to a budget constraint gives the per- capita demand for brand iin country Jwhich, with good Ydesignated as the 206numeraire, i=\u0000 AJ i\u0001\u001b\u0000 pJ i\u0001\u0000\u001b\u0000 PJ\u0001\u001b\u00001,J2fH;Fg (11.3) wherepJ iis the price of brand iin country J, and where PJis the price index associated with (11.2) which takes the form PJ\u0011\"X i2\u0002J\u0000 AJ i\u0001\u001b\u0000 pJ i\u00011\u0000\u001b#\u00001 \u001b\u00001 ,J2fH;Fg; (11.4) with\u001b= 1=(1\u0000 )the elasticity of substitution between every pair of brands. The aggregate demand for brand iby theNJidentical consumers in country Jis NJcJ i, and the indirect utility of the representative consumer is V\u0000 PJ;IJ\u0001 =IJ\u0000logPJ; J2fH;Fg; (11.5) whereIJis per-capita disposable income in country J. Turning to supply, Grossman, McCalman and Staiger assume that the nu- meraire good Yis always produced in both countries and freely traded between them, with a technology that turns one unit of labor into one unit of numeraire and hence xes the common wage rate across countries at one. The di\u00a4erentiated product industry, by contrast, has a free-entry monopolistic competition structure. To enter this industry, a rm pays a xed cost in units of labor that depends on its design choices for the versions of its brand that it o\u00a4ers in each market, according to the function zi\u0011z(jaH i\u0000aF ij)withz(0)>0,z0(\u0001)>0andz00(\u0001)\u00150. Hence, rms in the di\u00a4erentiated product industry face lower xed costs of serving mul- tiple markets when they sell versions of their brand across these markets that are closer together in the relevant characteristic space, consistent with the possibility of cost savings that could come from regulatory harmonization. Once the xed costs have been paid, a rm faces constant marginal costs. In particular, a rm iproducing a version of its brand with characteristic aiuses\u0015(ai)units of labor per unit of output, with \u00150(ai)\u00150; in the case of horizontal di\u00a4erentiation across the brand versions, \u00150(ai)\u00110so that all versions cost the same to produce, while with vertical di\u00a4erentiation \u00150(ai)>0so that higher quality costs more.148 As in Venables (1987), rms face both iceberg transport costs ( 1+ units must be shipped for delivery of 1unit) and ad valorem trade taxes (with Jdenoting the 148Grossman, McCalman and Staiger also impose some additional structure on the marginal cost function to ensure that second order conditions hold. 207tax/subsidy imposed on imports by country JandeJdenoting the tax/subsidy on goods exiting country J\u0092 s ports).149The variable trade costs faced by a rm located in country Jare then summarized by \u0013Jwhere \u0013J= 1 + +eJ+ K and where here and throughout this chapter I will adopt the convention that K refers to the country that is \u0093not J.\u0094Each government Jis also assumed to have at its disposal an ad valorem consumption subsidy, sJ, that it can use to address the monopoly-markup distortion in the di\u00a4erentiated product sector that is known to arise in settings such as this (see, e.g., Helpman and Krugman, 1989, pp. 137- 145). Hence, if rm ilocated in country Jsets a (common) factory-gate price qi, then consumers in country JpaypJ i= (1\u0000sJ)qiper unit for this product while consumers in country KpaypK i= (1\u0000sK)\u0013Jqi. For any given product characteristics, Grossman, McCalman and Staiger show that pro t-maximizing rms in the di\u00a4erentiated product sector will adopt familiar markup pricing behavior, which in this particular setting leads to the f.o.b. price for the version of brand iproduced in country Jand andJ0=H;F: (11.6) The consumer price of a typical local brand in country Jis then pJ J=\u0000 1\u0000sJ\u0001 qJ J; J=H;F, (11.7) while the consumer price of an imported brand in country Jis pJ K=\u0000 1\u0000sJ\u0001 \u0013KqJ K; J=H;F. (11.8) Finally, de ning the \u0093world\u0094 price of the exports from country J,pw J, as the o\u00a4shore price after export taxes have been collected, but before transport costs, import tari\u00a4s and consumption subsidies have been imposed, it follows that pw J\u0011(1 +eJ)qK J. Notice that world prices are independent of any horizontal char- acteristics of the di\u00a4erentiated products, because the marginal cost function \u0015(\u0001) 149In what follows I adopt the convention that country superscripts refer to the destination country and thus to variables or parameters related to demand, whereas country subscripts refer to the source country and thus to variables or parameters related to supply. I will sometimes apply both a subscript and a superscript to distinguish a good that is produced in one country and exported to the other. 208is constant across horizontally di\u00a4erentiated versions and hence qK Jis a constant according to (11.6). And in the case of vertical characteristics, (11.6) implies that world prices will rise one-for-one with the costs of the characteristics embodied in a brand supplied to a market, and hence the cost of vertical standards are completely passed through to consumers in the importing country. For these reasons, in this model governments cannot use their regulatory poli- cies (or their consumption subsidies or import tari\u00a4s, since world prices are inde- pendent of these) to manipulate world prices. This allows Grossman, McCalman and Staiger to ignore market access/terms-of-trade manipulation concerns associ- ated with the choice of standards, and to focus instead on the delocation motives for standard setting that are novel in this setting.150 I now turn to the rm\u0092 s choice of product design for the versions of its brand that it will sell in each market. Firms may be constrained in this choice by govern- ment regulations of course, but for now I consider the choices a rm would make if it had free rein over these choices. Firm ilocated in country JchoosesaJ iJand aK iJ, so as to maximize its overall pro ts taking the price index in each country as given and pricing its own brand according to (11.6). Its pro ts are can as \u0019iJ=\u001b\u0000\u001b(\u001b\u00001)\u001b\u00001\u0002h NJ\u0000 1\u0000sJ\u0001\u0000\u001bAJ\u0000 If were maximizing its operating pro ts alone, rm icould ignore the last term in (11.9), and this would allow it to choose aJ iJandaK iJso as to best serve each market iJ= ^aHandaF iJ= 150Bagwell and Staiger (2015) have shown in the Venables (1987) model that the delocation incentive with regard to trade taxes can be given a terms-of-trade interpretation, but only as long as governments have at their disposal a complete set of trade tax instruments (and in particular export tax/subsidies). As will become clear below, the thought experiment considered by Grossman, McCalman and Staiger is to suppose that trade taxes have been constrained by an existing trade agreement, and to then ask whether the regulatory choices of governments must also be constrained to achieve an e\u00a2 cient level of regulatory harmonization, along the (2015, happens to be the \u0093ideal version\u0094in the eyes of consumers in country J, consid- ering both the direct e\u00a4ect on utility and the indirect e\u00a4ect on prices.151But in light of the xed costs captured in the last term in (11.9), rms will not deliver the ideal version to any market when they have free rein over their choice of product characteristics. This is because a small reduction in aH iJbelow ^aH, the ideal level for country- Hconsumers, would generate only a second-order loss in operating pro ts for rm ibut a rst-order savings in design costs, and similarly for a small increase in aF iJabove ^aF. Re\u0087 ecting this logic, the unregulated rm imaximizes its pro ts by choosing versions of its brand that satisfy ^aH> aH iJ> aF iJ>^aF. With all rms in a country making the same design choices and earning the same pro ts according to (11.9), I now drop the rm- isubscripts and denote by ~aH Jand ~aF Jthe optimal, unregulated characteristic of a brand that is o\u00a4ered for sale in the home and foreign markets, respectively, and produced in country J. Whatever the regulatory regime, free entry will ensure that in equilibrium \u0019Jis non-positive for each Jwhen evaluated at the equilibrium price indexes, and these free-entry conditions determine the equilibrium number of brands, nJ, produced in each country J. If each country produces a strictly positive number of brands in equilibrium then the pair of zero pro t conditions \u0019H= 0 =\u0019Fmust hold; otherwise, for some J,nJ= 0and\u0019J\u00140. Grossman, McCalman and Staiger establish three properties that must hold in the \u0093unregulated equilibrium\u0094where governments place no constraints on the choices of characteristics, provided that trade taxes and consumption subsidies are such that \u0013H>1and\u0013F>1. First, the pro t-maximizing choices of product characteristics are such that ^aH>eaH H>eaH FandeaF H>eaF F>^aF. Intuitively, while no rm delivers the ideal version of its brand to any market ( ^aH>eaH HandeaF F>^aF), when\u0013H>1and \u0013F>1each rm makes a relatively greater share of its sales in its local market, so it is rms located in country Hthat have the relatively greater incentive to cater to country- Hconsumers (eaH H>eaH F), while it is rms located in country Fthat have the relatively greater incentive to cater to country- Fconsumers (eaF H>eaF F). Second, beginning at the optimal unregulated product characteristics, a small increase in any product characteristic aJ0 Jinduces exit by rms located in country H(dnH=daJ0 J<0) and entry by rms located in country F(dnF=daJ0 J>0) for 151If the versions of the brand are horizontally di\u00a4erentiated, then we have \u00150(ai)\u00110and the ideal version will simply maximize the demand shifter. With vertical di\u00a4erentiation, \u00150(ai)>0 and the ideal re\u0087 ects not only the local taste for higher quality, but also the recognition that quality comes at a cost. 210allJ2fH;FgandJ02fH;Fg. To see why, consider the case where J0=H. Starting from the optimal unregulated product characteristics, a small increase in aH Jhas no rst-order e\u00a4ect on pro ts at the initial price indexes, but for xed nH andnFit will reduce the country- Hprice index PHdirectly because aH Jmoves in the direction of the country- Hideal version ^aH. This leads to negative pro ts for all rms, but given the relative dependence of the rms located in country Hon country-Hsales, it hurts the rms located in country Hmore than it hurts rms located in country F; and the only way to bring back zero pro ts for all rms is for rms located in country Hto exit while rms located in country Fenter. A similar intuition holds for the case where J0=F. And third, beginning at the optimal unregulated product characteristics, a small change in any product characteristic aJ0 Jhas no rst-order e\u00a4ect on the home price index ( dPH=daJ0 J= 0) or on the foreign price index ( dPF=daJ0 J= 0), forJ2fH;FgandJ02fH;Fg. In other words, the changes in nHandnF described just above that are induced by a small change in aJ0 Jare such that the price indexes PHandPFare left unchanged. This is because, starting from the optimal unregulated product characteristics, a small change in aJ0 Jhas no rst- order e\u00a4ect on pro ts anywhere at the initial price indexes, and so the zero-pro t conditions will be maintained if the entry and exit described just above is such that the price indexes PHandPFremain unchanged. How is welfare measured in this model? Recalling from (11.5) that the indirect utility of the representative consumer in country Jis de ned by V\u0000 PJ;IJ\u0001 =IJ\u0000 logPJ, it remains to de ne IJ, the per-capita disposable income in country J. But as the free-entry conditions ensure that equilibrium pro ts are zero everywhere, the per-capita disposable income in country Jis simply the sum of country J\u0092 s per-capita labor income, which is constant and given by LJ=NJ, and per-capita net tax revenue, RJ, which Grossman, McCalman I have omitted the functional dependence of the equilibrium numbers of rms and the consumption levels on the tax rates and the product characteristics induced by the regulatory regime. This allows aggregate national welfare in country J; J, to be tax on goods exported from KtoJ. As usual, since the prices of imported goods in Jdo not depend separately on J andeK, but only on the net trade tax, zJ, it follows that the consumption levels cJ Kand the price index PJalso depends only on zJ, as do the pro t-maximizing characteristics in any regulatory regime and the equilibrium numbers of brands. And this implies the by-now-familiar property that global welfare depends on the choices ofzHandzF, and not on the particular combination of import tari\u00a4 and export tax that are used to achieve these net taxes. 11.2. Mutual Recognition when consumption externalities are absent In the setting I have described above, where consumption externalities are absent, Grossman, McCalman and Staiger show that rms\u0092pro t-maximizing choices of product attributes are globally optimal, but national governments have unilateral incentives to invoke regulatory protectionism to induce rm delocation as in Ven- ables (1987) and Ossa (2011). But they also show that shallow integration is still possible: if tari\u00a4s are negotiated to e\u00a2 cient levels, and if consumption subsidies must conform to national treatment and hence must be o\u00a4ered by a country on a non-discriminatory basis for the consumption of all di\u00a4erentiated products regard- less of origin, then a rule requiring mutual recognition of standards can be used to achieve e\u00a2 ciency with a shallow form of integration, though shallow integration that relies only on national treatment would fall short. To explain these results, I consider rst the e\u00a2 ciency of rms\u0092pro t-maximizing choices of product attributes in the unregulated equilibrium, and the unilateral incentive governments have to delocate foreign rms with regulatory protection- ism. This can be understood with the help of Figure 11.1, which is reproduced from Grossman, McCalman and Staiger (2021). To construct this gure, I set net tari\u00a4s and consumption subsidies at their e\u00a2 cient levels zHe= 0 =zFeand \u0093e\u0094 denotes an e\u00a2 cient magnitude, and I position product attributes at the pro t-maximizing levels that rms would choose in an unregulated equilibrium when net tari\u00a4s and consumption subsidies are set in this way. That there is an e\u00a2 ciency role for a consumption subsidy in each country and that it is inversely related to the 212elasticity of substitution between pairs of brands is not surprising, because as I mentioned earlier it is well-known that such a subsidy can correct the monopoly- markup distortion in the di\u00a4erentiated product sector of each country that arises in settings such as this; and the absence of an e\u00a2 ciency role for tari\u00a4 intervention should also come as no surprise. But notice from (11.11) that with tax/subsidies set in this e\u00a2 cient fashion, world welfare is then given by =X JLJ\u0000X JNJlogPJ\u0000X JNJ1 \u001b\u00001(11.12) and depends 11.1, with NH\u0000 PH\u0001\u001b\u00001and NF\u0000 PF\u0001\u001b\u00001on the axes, has all the information needed to assess world welfare and hence the e\u00a2 ciency properties of a given set of product attributes. Figure 11.1 (Reproduced from Grossman, McCalman and Staiger, 2021) The combinations of NH\u0000 PH\u0001\u001b\u00001andNF\u0000 PF\u0001\u001b\u00001that are consistent with zero pro ts for home rms are given by the downward-sloping line labelled \u0019H= 0, while the combinations of NH\u0000 PH\u0001\u001b\u00001andNF\u0000 PF\u0001\u001b\u00001that are consistent with zero pro ts for foreign rms are given by the downward-sloping line labelled \u0019F= 0. That these lines are downward sloping re\u0087 ects the fact that a lower price index in one market makes that market more competitive and reduces rm pro ts there, and for a rm to maintain zero pro ts this must be o\u00a4set by a higher price index in the other market. And as drawn, the \u0019H= 0line must be steeper than 213the\u0019F= 0line, re\u0087 ecting the relative importance of the local market for rms of each country that comes from positive trade impediments. Figure 11.1 also depicts the combinations of NH\u0000 PH\u0001\u001b\u00001andNF\u0000 PF\u0001\u001b\u00001 that are consistent with nH>0andnF>0, namely, the combinations that lie inside the cone de ned by the rays from the origin labeled nH= 0andnF= 0. These rays can be derived from the expressions for PFandPH, and they depict the combinations of NH\u0000 PH\u0001\u001b\u00001andNF\u0000 PF\u0001\u001b\u00001for which the world\u0092 s production of di\u00a4erentiated products would be concentrated in one country or the other, countryHalong the ray labeled nF= 0and country Falong the ray labeled nH= 0. For combinations of NH\u0000 PH\u0001\u001b\u00001andNF\u0000 PF\u0001\u001b\u00001inside the cone, both countries have an active di\u00a4erentiated product sector, and as noted above, in that case equilibrium requires \u0019H= 0and\u0019F= 0. Such an equilibrium is depicted in Figure 11.1 by the point labeled Q, where the two zero-pro t lines intersect. This implies that the unregulated equilibrium has active producers in the di\u00a4erentiated-product sectors of both countries.152 Finally, Figure 11.1 depicts the iso-world-welfare curve passing through the unregulated equilibrium point Q, as implied by (11.12). This curve is globally convex, and when Qfalls inside the cone de ned by nH= 0andnF= 0its slope lies between the slope of the \u0019H= 0line and that of the \u0019F= 0line. World welfare is increasing for lower iso-world-welfare curves that lie closer to the origin. To see that rms\u0092pro t-maximizing choices of product attributes are glob- ally optimal when coupled with zero net trade taxes and markup-o\u00a4setting con- sumption subsidies, recall that, beginning at the optimal unregulated product characteristics, a small change in any product characteristic aJ0 Jhas no rst-order e\u00a4ect on the home price index ( dPH=daJ0 J= 0) or on the foreign price index (dPF=daJ0 J= 0), forJ2fH;FgandJ02fH;Fg. But by (11.12), this means that when trade taxes and consumption subsidies are set at their e\u00a2 cient levels and beginning at the optimal unregulated product characteristics, the rst-order conditions for maximizing are satis ed at Q; and Grossman, McCalman and Staiger show that the second-order conditions are globally met at Qas well. The upshot is that if net tari\u00a4s are set to their e\u00a2 cient level of zero, and if consumption subsidies are set at their markup-o\u00a4setting levels, then the unregu- lated pro t-maximizing rm choices of product attributes will deliver the world to the e\u00a2 ciency frontier. What kind of a trade agreement can deliver this out- come? Grossman, McCalman and Staiger show that the agreement will have to 152I will restrict my discussion here to non-specialized equilibria of this kind, but Grossman, McCalman and Staiger discuss the full set of equilibrium possibilities. 214constrain tari\u00a4s to e\u00a2 cient levels, consistent with the earlier of Venables (1987), Ossa (2011) and Bagwell and Staiger (2015). They also show that the level of consumption subsidies need not be constrained by an agreement, as long as the agreement speci es that these subsidies satisfy national treatment and are therefore o\u00a4ered by a country on a non-discriminatory basis for the consumption of all di\u00a4erentiated products regardless of origin.153In terms of Figure 11.1, this property re\u0087 ects the fact that a non-discriminatory deviation from the e\u00a2 cient consumption subsidy level initiated by one country will shift both the \u0019H= 0line and the\u0019F= 0line in a way that leaves the price index of the other country \u0096and hence the welfare of the other country \u0096unchanged; and with the consumption subsidy initially positioned at the e\u00a2 cient level, the rst country cannot bene t from this deviation if the welfare of the second country does not fall. How should product standards be handled in a trade agreement? Figure 11.1 makes clear that they cannot simply be left out of the agreement. Consider for example the incentives that country Hhas to impose product regulations if it has free rein to do so, noting that any regulation that requires rms to adopt a discretely di\u00a4erent product characteristic than their pro t-maximizing choice will reduce their pro ts. If country Hwere to regulate its own rms\u0092o\u00a4erings in the local market, by requiring that aH Hdi\u00a4er discretely from the pro t-maximizing choice ~aH H, then the\u0019H= 0line in Figure 11.1 would shift out, leading to a rise inPHonce the rm entry and exit needed to restore zero pro ts for all rms had occurred, and therefore to a fall in country- Hwelfare. A similar result would occur if country Hwere to regulate aF H, the product attribute that its rms chose for sales in the foreign market. Clearly country Htherefore has no incentive to regulate its own rms. But if country Hwere to regulate the o\u00a4erings of foreign rms in its local market, by requiring that aH Fdi\u00a4er discretely from the pro t- maximizing choice ~aH F, then the\u0019F= 0line in Figure 11.1 would shift to the right, leading to a rise in PFbut a fallinPHonce the rm entry and exit needed to restore zero pro ts for all rms had occurred, and therefore to a rise in country- H welfare at the expense of the welfare of country- F. In e\u00a4ect, by regulating foreign rms in its market, a country can diminish the pro ts of foreign rms and cause exit of rms in the foreign country, triggering entry of rms in the home country as a result of the reduction in world-wide competition; and the resulting \u0093 rm delocation\u0094is bene cial to the country that acquires more local rms, due to the 153This property also re\u0087 ects the fact that, as I mentioned earlier, in the model of Grossman, McCalman and Staiger consumption subsidies cannot be used to manipulate the terms of trade. 215savings on trade costs that is implied.154 Grossman, McCalman and Staiger show that, if left unchecked, these incentives would lead countries to impose extreme product standards on their imported prod- ucts that, in the Nash equilibrium of a non-cooperative standard-setting game, would result in product standards that imply ine\u00a2 ciently high design costs for rms attempting to serve multiple markets. By implication, a trade agreement that led countries from this starting point to the e\u00a2 ciency frontier would there- fore indeed result in regulatory convergence, consistent with the views expressed by Lamy (2015, 2016), if by that term what is meant is an agreement that calls for changes in product standards across countries that reduce rms\u0092total design costs. The remaining question is how to design an agreement that would achieve the needed convergence in product standards and deliver countries to the e\u00a2 ciency frontier. Is there anything short of deep integration (i.e., negotiating directly over product standards) that would do the trick? It might be thought that an extension of the national treatment rule to apply not only to consumption subsidies but also to product standards, as is true of the national treatment requirement in the GATT/WTO, might be su\u00a2 cient to prevent the kind of regulatory protectionism that I have just described, and in so doing could allow governments to reach the e\u00a2 ciency frontier with a shallow approach to integration. But Grossman, McCalman and Staiger show that, while better than nothing, reliance on the national treatment rule would fall short in this regard. As they note, there are two problems with such an approach. First, if the national treatment rule were interpreted as requiring that the same product standard applied to local rms in a market must also apply to the sales of foreign rms in that market, then e\u00a2 ciency could not be achieved, because the e\u00a2 cient product characteristics in a given market are di\u00a4erent for local and foreign rms, with e\u00a2 ciency dictating that the product attributes of the former should be closer to the local ideal than those of the latter. Suppose, then, that the national treatment rule is interpreted more broadly, and allows governments to announce a setof permissible standards, requiring only that all rms selling in a given market must be confronted with the same set of standards to choose from in that market. This leads to the second problem: as Grossman, McCalman 154As Grossman, McCalman and Staiger observe, in addition to the rm delocation incentive there is also a \u0093product suitability\u0094e\u00a4ect that helps drive the incentive to deviate from e\u00a2 cient standards in their model. However, as they note in their Online Appendix (pp 15-17), the product suitability motive may or may not be operative on the margin in the Nash equilibrium, but the delocation motive always is operative, which is why I emphasize that motive in the text. 216and Staiger demonstrate, if rms selling to a market were o\u00a4ered a common set of standards from which to choose, all rms would choose the standard meant to apply to local rms in that market (and hence the less-distortionary standard) and therefore welfare can be no higher than what is achievable under a single standard for each country, which we already know cannot achieve e\u00a2 ciency. As it turns out, what would allow a shallow integration approach to work in this setting is a so-called \u0093mutual recognition\u0094clause of the sort included for example in the customs treaty of the European Union. Under this clause, each country agrees to respect the legitimacy of the other\u0092 s regulatory aims, and any product that meets the standards in an exporting country is therefore considered acceptable for sale in the importing country as well. Under mutual recognition, then, exporting rms have a choice of whether to meet the standards in the des- tination market or those in their own country. As Grossman, McCalman and Staiger demonstrate, a rule requiring mutual recognition of standards can be used to achieve e\u00a2 ciency with shallow integration in this setting. To see this, suppose that, as above, countries negotiate tari\u00a4s to e\u00a2 cient lev- els and require that consumption subsidies satisfy national treatment, but now also include in the agreement a mutual recognition clause for product standards. Subsequent to the agreement, countries are then allowed to set their consump- tion subsidies and choose their product standards unilaterally as they see t, subject to these rules. As before, with tari\u00a4s constrained to e\u00a2 cient levels and zHe= 0 =zFe, neither country will have any incentive to deviate from adopting an e\u00a2 cient consumption subsidy, with the result that the two governments will also implement the e\u00a2 cient consumption subsidies sHe= 1=\u001b=sFe. But now, in the ensuing standard-setting game with mutual recognition, each government maintains a degree of control over the standards under which its own rms must operate, since its rms can always choose to operate everywhere under the standards that the government sets. In particular, as long as governments are allowed to choose multiple acceptable standards (or a range of acceptable standards), in the Nash equilibrium of this standard-setting game each government will choose as permissible standards for its market the (pair of) standards that would maximize the pro ts of its representative national rm, because by mutual recognition its rms can then produce to (their choice among) these standards in each of the markets that they serve. In terms of Figure 11.1, these choices are optimal for each government, because they allow each government to position the zero-pro t line applicable to its rms \u0096the only zero-pro t line that it has control over in the presence of the mutual recognition clause \u0096at its lowest level possible. 217Evidently, under national treatment for taxes and mutual recognition for prod- uct standards and with tari\u00a4 negotiations alone, a trade agreement can achieve the degree of regulatory harmonization needed to replicate the unregulated equi- librium. And in this way, governments can in principle still arrive at the e\u00a2 ciency frontier with a shallow-integration approach to integration \u0096though an approach that relies on mutual recognition of product standards and therefore di\u00a4ers in important ways from current GATT/WTO practice \u0096despite the presence of the kinds of international externalities that can arise with regulatory heterogeneity as Lamy (2015, 2016) emphasized and that may nonetheless be justi ed by cross- country di\u00a4erences in collective preferences as noted by Sykes (1999a, 1999b).155 11.3. Deep integration in the presence of consumption externalities The ndings of Grossman, McCalman and Staiger (2021) that I have reviewed above lend support to the e\u00a2 cacy of a form of shallow integration even when a degree of regulatory harmonization is desirable, but these ndings are derived under the assumption that there are no externalities associated with consumption, an assumption that underpins the property of the model that, given free rein, rms would choose the \u0093right\u0094product attributes. A remaining question is whether the support for shallow integration provided by these ndings extends to a setting where consumption externalities are present. As Grossman, McCalman and Staiger observe, introducing consumption ex- ternalities into the model will naturally introduce scope for e\u00a2 ciency-enhancing product standards. For example, an individual\u0092 s utility might be a function not only of how close the products that she herself consumes are to an idealized version, but also a function of how close the products consumed by her fellow nationals come to this ideal. This is an externality associated with consumption that the sub-utility index CJ Dde ned in (11.2) does not allow, but it is the kind of externality that might arise in the context of safety features that are embod- ied in the cars on the road in a given country, or when a product\u0092 s health or environmental impacts on a country depend on the country\u0092 s collective choices. 155Grossman, McCalman and Staiger observe that the mutual recognition clause of the Euro- pean Union includes a stipulation that the clause can be invoked by an exporter only if a similar good is \u0093lawfully marketed\u0094in its local market. If this term is interpreted as a minimum sales requirement, then the stipulation would interfere with the e\u00a2 ciency properties of mutual recog- nition according to the arguments I have outlined above. However, as Grossman, McCalman and Staiger point out (see their note 30), the legal interpretation of this stipulation is unclear, and so the extent of the ine\u00a2 ciency that it creates according to their ndings is also unclear. 218In a setting where such externalities are present, an e\u00a2 ciency-enhancing role for product standards naturally arises. The question then is whether in this setting the shallow approach to integration described above, or something like it, could continue to deliver governments to the e\u00a2 ciency frontier. To capture these kinds of externalities, Grossman, McCalman and Staiger introduce the following extended version of the sub-utility index de ned demand shifter associated with the \u0093idealized product type,\u0094 that is, the most appealing version of brand ito consumers in country J, regardless of price; and cJ i\u0016denotes mean country- J consumption, while the parameter \u0018measures (inversely) the extent of the con- sumption externality. When \u0018!1, the expression for CJ Din (11.13) converges to the original expression in (11.2) where a consumer cares only about the charac- teristics of brand ithat she consumes herself and su\u00a4ers a loss in utility to the extent that the version she herself consumes di\u00a4ers from her idealized product type. But when \u0018!0, the consumer cares only negligibly about the particular types of goods that she purchases herself and almost entirely about the types of goods consumed in her country in the aggregate. In this case the externality is extreme, as the consumer bene ts the same from buying any version of a brand i, but loses utility when others in her country make purchases that are far from her idealized product type. Indeed, when \u0018!0the use-value to an individual is the same for all feasible versions of a brand and so consumers ignore its negative attributes entirely when expressing their market demands. Notice that, according to (11.13), the negative externality disappears when aJ i=a\u0003J\u0011arg maxaAJ(a)and the product attributes o\u00a4ered to country Jcoin- cide with country J\u0092 s idealized product types. This allows Grossman, McCalman and Staiger to abstract from spillovers that arise from consumption per se , and which give rise to the usual arguments for Pigouvian taxes, and focus instead on those associated with product type and that might motivate product standards. Moreover, note that when cJ i=cJ i\u0016(as must be true in equilibrium with iden- tical consumers in each country), the aggregate CJ Dis independent of \u0018: that is, according to (11.13), as the parameter \u0018drops from a value of 1, the equilibrium valuation that the representative consumer in country Jplaces on deviations of 219the product attribute from a\u0003Jare held constant while the fraction of this valua- tion that is attributable to the consumption of others is increased. This implies that the size of \u0018does not a\u00a4ect the globally-optimal product characteristics, consumption per brand, or numbers of home and foreign rms, which I have al- ready described above for the case of \u0018= 1and which evidently apply also for any\u00182(0;1). For future reference I now denote the globally-optimal product attributes for goods produced in country Jand sold in country J0, which as I have just noted are simply the e\u00a2 cient product attributes for the case of \u0018= 1as characterized above, by aJ0e J. The upshot is that I now need only describe how the market equilibrium in the absence of corrective policies di\u00a4ers from the social optimum when \u0018 <1, and then describe the set of policy interventions that will induce the social optimum. Armed with these results, I can then investigate the kind of trade agreement that would be capable of implementing those policy interventions and thereby deliver countries to the e\u00a2 ciency frontier in the presence of consumption externalities. According to (11.13), each individual in country Jnow perceives the demand shifterAJ i\u0011(1\u0000\u0018)A\u0003J+\u0018A\u0000 aJ i; J\u0001 when calculating her optimal purchases of brandi. This continues to generate the per-capita demands in (11.3), where the price index for di\u00a4erentiated products PJcontinues to be computed as in (11.4). However, PJ\u0096 which I now refer to as the \u0093 brand-level price index\u0094 \u0096 no longer is the same as the price index that guides the allocation of spending to di\u00a4erentiated products, nor is it the price index that enters the indirect utility function in (11.5). Rather, as Grossman, McCalman and Staiger show, in the presence of consumption externalities the indirect utility function is now given by V\u0000 PJ;IJ\u0001 =IJ\u0000logPJ; J2fH;Fg; shifter that accounts for the externalities. I will follow Grossman, McCalman and Staiger and refer \u0018= (11.14) thatPJ=PJand the industry-level and brand-level price indices coincide. But the presence of consumption externalities ( \u0018 < 1) implies that AJ i>AJ iand therefore by (11.14) that PJ>PJ: the industry-level price index that determines 220aggregate spending on di\u00a4erentiated products as a group is greater than the brand- level price index that guides individual consumption choices at the variety level. This implies that each consumer spends less on the bundle of di\u00a4erentiated goods as a whole than she would facing the same prices but with no externalities, re- \u0087 ecting the fact that the negative externalities reduce consumer enthusiasm for this bundle. At the same time, the externality causes a relative distortion of con- sumption across brands, away from varieties whose characteristics are closer to a\u0003Jand towards those whose characteristics are relatively far from a\u0003J. In other words, individuals over-consume inferior goods when they ignore the externalities that their consumption choices confer on others. As Grossman, McCalman and Staiger demonstrate, these additional consump- tion distortions imply that there are new roles for trade policy and consumption tax policy in the presence of consumption externalities. In particular, global e\u00a2 - ciency now requires zH>0andsH>1=\u001b; and it requires zF>0andsF>1=\u001b if versions of a brand are horizontally di\u00a4erentiated, but zF<0andsF<1=\u001bif versions of a brand are vertically di\u00a4erentiated. Intuitively, and recalling that the e\u00a2 cient product attributes aJ0e Jare the same as those in the absence of consumption externalities and therefore satisfy a\u0003H> aHe H> aHe Fin the market of country H, the goal of e\u00a2 cient tax policy intervention is to face country- Hconsumers with prices that lead them to shift consumption toward locally produced brands and away from imports, owing to the greater (negative) externality associated with the consumption of imports im- plied bya\u0003H>aHe H>aHe F. A positive net import tari\u00a4 ( zH>0) can achieve this goal when it is combined with a country- Hconsumption subsidy greater than the level needed to o\u00a4set the monopoly-markup distortion ( sH>1=\u001b): the larger subsidy generates extra demand for local brands, while the combined consumption subsidy and net trade tax discourage consumption of imported brands. If brands are horizontally di\u00a4erentiated, analogous arguments applied to country Fexplain why e\u00a2 ciency also requires zF>0andsF>1=\u001b; and if brands are vertically di\u00a4erentiated, then the negative externality is strictly decreasing in the character- istic that measures product quality, and it is the consumption of local brands in countryFwith their lower quality that confer the greater negative externalities and must be discouraged, which can be accomplished with zF<0andsF<1=\u001b. What about the regulation of product characteristics? Recall that in the absence of consumption externalities no regulation of product characteristics is needed, because the characteristics that rms would choose to maximize their pro ts coincide with the e\u00a2 cient characteristics. But as I have noted, when \u0018 <1 221and consumption externalities are present, consumers are insu\u00a2 ciently sensitive to the negative attributes of a product that deviates from the idealized type when expressing their market demands. And so, if given free rein to respond to market demands, rms in both countries will insu\u00a2 ciently di\u00a4erentiate the local and ex- port versions of their brands compared to what is globally e\u00a2 cient. Regulation is therefore now needed to ensure e\u00a2 cient product designs, with the optimal stan- dards inducing rms to design products closer to the idealized product type in each destination market compared to their pro t-maximizing choices. Having described the set of policy interventions that induce the social op- timum, I now consider the kind of trade agreement that would be capable of implementing these policy interventions and thereby capable of delivering coun- tries to the e\u00a2 ciency frontier in the presence of consumption externalities. A rst observation is immediate: shallow integration based on mutual recognition cannot implement e\u00a2 cient product standards in the presence of consumption externali- ties.156This much is clear, once it is recalled that in the absence of consumption externalities a mutual recognition clause works because it allows governments to provide their own rms with the ability to choose pro t-maximizing product stan- dards in all markets \u0096which in the absence of consumption externalities are, after all, the e\u00a2 cient product attributes \u0096and both governments and their rms have incentive to make these e\u00a2 cient selections. But as I have noted just above, when consumption externalities are present the product characteristics chosen by pro t- maximizing rms are ine\u00a2 cient; and in fact, as Grossman, McCalman and Staiger observe, neither rms nor their governments would have incentive to select e\u00a2 - cient product standards under mutual recognition in this case. Hence, the logic of mutual recognition as a rule for implementing e\u00a2 cient product standards breaks down when consumption externalities are present. Is there an alternative approach to shallow integration with respect to prod- uct standards that could work in this setting? As I have reviewed in previous chapters, the non-violation clause, at least in principle, has been shown to be a versatile tool for facilitating shallow integration in many settings when other rules are insu\u00a2 cient to do the job, by providing governments with a last-resort \u0093market-access-preservation-rule.\u0094But as Grossman, McCalman and Staiger ob- serve, reliance on the non-violation clause for this purpose, even in a potentially modi ed version, appears especially challenging in the current setting. To see why, recall that the core feature of the non-violation clause is that in its presence country Kis insulated from the e\u00a4ects of any unilateral behind- 156Costinot (2008) reports an analogous nding, though in a very di\u00a4erent setting. 222the-border policy adjustments that country Jmight consider once an agreement on border measures has been signed between KandJ, a feature that naturally leads country Jto make such policy choices e\u00a2 ciently. As I have described in previous chapters, according to the terms-of-trade theory of trade agreements this insulation is accomplished with a non-violation clause built around a simple concept of market access, and where the terms of trade is preserved under any post-agreement behind-the-border policy adjustments made by country Jthat are consistent with this clause. For a non-violation clause to work in the present setting, then, the allowable unilateral policy adjustments of country Jmust, under the non-violation clause, preserve the welfare of country K,V\u0000 PK;IK\u0001 . There are two challenges in specifying a workable non-violation clause in this setting. A rst challenge arises whenever product standards are under considera- tion and relates to the fact that, unlike standards for workplace safety that impact the costs of domestic production or scal interventions such as tari\u00a4s and subsi- dies, product standards alter the nature of the goods to which the standards apply, and this complicates the interpretation of market access: Should it be concluded that market access is preserved as long as sales volume at the original exporter price would not be altered, even when foreign exporters are required to meet a new higher product standard and as a consequence now face higher costs? Staiger and Sykes (2011, 2021) show in the context of the terms-of-trade theory that the non-violation clause can be applied to the case of product standards without fur- ther modi cation if market access is de ned with reference to the exporter price of the \u0093raw\u0094unregulated product. But in the present setting, where it is regula- tory heterogeneity across markets that raises costs, and where the xed costs of market entry are impacted by this heterogeneity, making reference to the exporter price of an unregulated product no longer does the job; and it is not clear what alternative modi cations to the non-violation clause would su\u00a2 ce. A second challenge is due speci cally to the presence of consumption exter- nalities. If a non-violation clause is to succeed in the present setting at allowing countryJto consider only those unilateral policy adjustments that would preserve the welfare of country K, then the clause will have to be sensitive to more than just market magnitudes. In particular, to ensure that V\u0000 PK;IK\u0001 is not altered by countryJ\u0092 s behind-the-border policy adjustments, the non-violation clause must be sensitive to country K\u0092 sindustry-level price indexPK, a sensitivity that as (11.14) con rms requires knowledge beyond the market magnitudes that deter- mine the brand-level price index PKand extends to detailed information about the consumption externalities in country K. In e\u00a4ect, while the consumption 223externalities themselves do not cross national borders by assumption, it is never- theless the case that the choices of product attributes made by country- J rms will interact with the consumption externalities in country K, independent of the market magnitudes induced by these choices. Accordingly, this second challenge is in some sense more fundamental than the rst, because it means that in the present setting a rule that ensures the preservation of market access \u0096however de ned \u0096will not be enough to facilitate shallow integration. 11.4. The push for regulatory convergence and the design of the WTO The ndings of Grossman, McCalman and Staiger (2021) reviewed above have several implications for the design of the WTO in a world where preferences are heterogeneous across countries and rms face higher costs when they tailor brand attributes to local tastes. Where consumption externalities exist and product standards have a clear role to play in addressing these externalities, the implica- tions for the design of the WTO are most profound. In this case, and even when these externalities do not cross national borders, the WTO\u0092 s shallow approach to integration is ill-equipped to orchestrate the degree of regulatory convergence that would be required to eliminate the ine\u00a2 ciencies associated with the unilat- eral choices of such standards. According to these ndings, an e\u00a2 cient trade agreement must instead coordinate the ne details of such standards. Where the existence of consumption externalities cannot be established, how- ever, these ndings suggest that less-fundamental changes to WTO design may be needed. Here, the nding that national treatment by itself would not be suf- cient to allow countries to implement e\u00a2 cient product standards with shallow integration is not so di\u00a4erent from the ndings of Staiger and Sykes (2011, 2021), who report a similar result in the context of the terms-of-trade theory but argue that national treatment, when combined with a non-violation clause as a last- resort method of preventing terms-of-trade manipulation, can nevertheless lead to e\u00a4ective shallow integration. While in the present context the non-violation clause faces signi cant challenges when consumption externalities are present as I have noted, these challenges are likely to be more manageable when externalities are absent and the second challenge enumerated above is not operative; in this case a modi ed non-violation clause might arguably be combined with national treatment to facilitate e\u00a2 cient shallow integration, along the lines that Staiger and Sykes have suggested. Still, the ndings reviewed above indicate that mu- tual recognition could be a particularly e\u00a4ective rule in this setting for achieving 224e\u00a2 cient product standards with shallow integration, suggesting that such an ap- proach might be an attractive alternative for the WTO to consider. Finally, it should be emphasized that product standards per se are not the issue here, nor is the issue simply the presence of externalities that can motivate the use of product standards. After all, as I noted in chapter 3, Staiger and Sykes (2011, 2021) have shown that the broad features of the GATT/WTO shallow approach to integration are well-suited to allow countries to achieve e\u00a2 cient product standards in the context of the terms-of-trade theory, and their results apply whether or not (local) externalities exist that can provide an e\u00a2 ciency rationale for such standards. Rather, it is in a world where preferences are heterogeneous across countries and rms face higher costs when they tailor their product attributes to local tastes, in combination with the presence of consumption externalities the size of which are determined by those product attributes, that the most serious potential problems of a shallow-integration approach to product standards have been shown by Grossman, McCalman and Staiger to arise. Taken together, these ndings suggest that countries might negotiate selec- tively over product standards where externality problems are su\u00a2 ciently severe, and then rely on some combination of national treatment and the non-violation clause combined with mutual recognition, perhaps with exceptions to mutual recognition allowed if the existence of harmful externalities can be proven, to achieve e\u00a2 cient policies for standards that were not directly negotiated.157I will return to discuss this possibility further in chapter 13. Part III The Future of the Rules-Based Multilateral Trading System I use the nal three chapters to wrap up. In chapter 12 I cover brie\u0087 y three topics that have been omitted from previous chapters: the clash of sovereignty and globalization, the decline of US hegemonic power and its implications for the 157In essence, such exceptions to mutual recognition amount to a \u0093rebuttable presumption\u0094 that regulatory requirements imposed by the host country on a foreign provider will violate the mutual recognition clause, mirroring the design of the European Union\u0092 s mutual recognition clause (see Ortino, 2007, p. 312.). 225world trading system, and the WTO\u0092 s role in preparing for the next pandemic. In chapter 13 I distill the ndings covered in previous chapters and describe the broad outlines of a world trading system for the twenty- rst century. Finally, chapter 14 o\u00a4ers a brief conclusion. 12. The Elephants in the Room No single book can cover all of the important issues that have been raised by globalization over the past several decades and with which the world trading system of the twenty- rst century must contend. But omitted from the coverage of previous chapters are several issues that deserve special mention. In this chapter I touch brie\u0087 y on these \u0093elephants in the room.\u0094 12.1. The clash of sovereignty and globalization The con\u0087 ict between openness and national sovereignty is at the forefront of con- temporary debate over globalization. This con\u0087 ict has been growing since the early 1990\u0092 s, but it was not always present. During much of the GATT era, any hint of such a con\u0087 ict would have been resolved in favor of the preservation of na- tional sovereignty. For example, writing about the approach taken by the drafters of GATT to issue areas relating to behind-the-border measures, Hudec (1990, p. 24) provides a window into the subservient status of trade agreements relative to issues of national sovereignty at the time, observing that \u0093... governments would never have agreed to circumscribe their freedom in all these other areas for the sake of a mere tari\u00a4 agreement.\u0094 Of course, the evolution toward deep-integration agreements that I describe in chapter 1 and have revisited in various chapters throughout the book makes Hudec\u0092 s observation now appear quaint. Indeed, it is this evolution, taking place in regional and mega-regional negotiations around the world and to a lesser extent in the transition from GATT to the WTO, that has in large part been the focus of those who feel that the sovereignty of their national governments has been eroded by globalization. But has globalization really come at the cost of national sovereignty? And what exactly is meant by sovereignty, anyway? An answer to this second question must logically precede an answer to the rst. And scholars who have thought deeply about the meaning of sovereignty don\u0092 t always answer the rst question in the a\u00a2 rmative. For example, on the particular question of whether the GATT/WTO violates traditional notions of national sovereignty, 226Rabkin (1998, pp. 85-86) takes the position that it does not, stating:158 Probably the single most e\u00a4ective and consequential international program of the postwar era has been the mutual reduction of trade barriers under the General Agreement on Tari\u00a4s and Trade, initiated in 1947. Reason- able questions may be raised about certain aspects of the World Trade Organization, established in 1995 to help administer GATT norms. But, fundamentally, the trading system is quite compatible with traditional no- tions of sovereignty. It was developed on the foundations of much older sorts of international agreement, which would have been quite recognizable to the Framers of the Constitution. More broadly, what are the sovereign rights of nations, and to what extent do these rights stand in the way of achieving internationally e\u00a2 cient outcomes? In this section I describe the results of Bagwell and Staiger (2018b), who propose answers to these questions and employ those answers to evaluate with respect to issues of national sovereignty the design features of the GATT/WTO. As Bagwell and Staiger observe, de ning sovereignty is not a simple task, es- pecially if the goal is to capture elements that feature prominently in the common usage of the term. This di\u00a2 culty stems in part from the fact that the international political economy literature where sovereignty has been most discussed is not al- ways clear about the precise meaning of the term and, when clear, does not always adopt a uniform meaning. Krasner (1999) employs a taxonomy to represent four distinct ways in which the term \u0093sovereignty\u0094 has been commonly used in this literature: domestic sovereignty , which refers to the organization and e\u00a4ective- ness of political authority within the state; international legal sovereignty , which refers to the mutual recognition of states; interdependence sovereignty , which refers to the scope of activities over which states can e\u00a4ectively exercise control; and Westphalian sovereignty , which maintains as its central premise the rule of non- intervention in the internal a\u00a4airs of other states. The de nition of sovereignty proposed by Bagwell and Staiger builds from the Westphalian norm of non-intervention in the internal a\u00a4airs of other states. To formalize this norm, the terms \u0093non-intervention\u0094and \u0093internal a\u00a4airs\u0094must be de ned. Bagwell and Staiger argue that three key features of Westphalian sov- ereignty can be ascertained from a review of the international political economy literature, and that these features can serve as a guide to an acceptable de ni- tion of sovereignty. First, commitments that result from voluntary international 158See also Rodrik (2020), who articulates a similar view for GATT but less so for the WTO. 227agreements do not necessarily violate Westphalian sovereignty. Second, interna- tional commitments over policies ciently domestic\u0094a\u00a4airs (i.e., internal a\u00a4airs) doviolate Westphalian sovereignty. And third, international com- mitments that distort or derange the normal operation of domestic institutions also violate Westphalian sovereignty. Bagwell and Staiger argue that these three features should be re\u0087 ected in a de nition of sovereignty that is meant to capture the Westphalian norm in the context of voluntary international agreements. To construct a de nition of sovereignty that can re\u0087 ect these features, Bag- well and Staiger propose a formal de nition of internal a\u00a4airs which augments the Westphalian emphasis on authority over the determination of institutions and poli- cies, and adds to this an emphasis on authority and control over the determination of outcomes and therefore payo\u00a4s as well, all evaluated from the perspective of the Nash policy equilibrium of a given model world. This de nes the domain of a coun- try\u0092 s sovereign rights, from which encroachment by international agreements can then be assessed. In e\u00a4ect, the de nition of internal a\u00a4airs proposed by Bagwell and Staiger combines elements of authority with elements of control/e\u00a4ectiveness, and in so doing delivers a notion of sovereignty that exhibits traditional features of Westphalian sovereignty (the maintenance of authority over institutions and policies), interdependence sovereignty (the maintenance of e\u00a4ective control over cross-border activities) and domestic sovereignty (the maintenance of authority and e\u00a4ective control over activities within the territory). The characterization of a country\u0092 s internal a\u00a4airs that results according to the de nition proposed by Bagwell and Staiger depends on the nature of interdepen- dence across countries, which is in turn de ned by the \u0093externality\u0094variables of the model world that capture how one country\u0092 s policy choices impact the welfare of other countries. And as the nature of interdependence changes, so too will the scope of a country\u0092 s internal a\u00a4airs and hence the domain of its sovereign rights. This property resonates with the views of Jackson (2003), who argues for the need to update the traditional Westphalian concept of sovereignty.159 159Jackson\u0092 s (2003) proposes an updated concept of Westphalian sovereignty that he terms \u0093sovereignty-modern,\u0094 and which is meant to be more consistent with international e\u00a2 ciency and the need for international policy coordination in the modern world. The formal de nition of sovereignty that Bagwell and Staiger propose achieves some of what Jackson has in mind, in that according to their de nition the domain of sovereignty will evolve as the nature of international interdependence evolves. But unlike Jackson, Bagwell and Staiger do not tailor their de nition of sovereignty on a case-by-case basis to be in harmony with international e\u00a2 ciency. Instead, as I describe below, they evaluate formally the circumstances when a tradeo\u00a4 between maintaining national sovereignty according to their de nition and achieving international e\u00a2 ciency can be 228Of particular relevance when applied to trade agreements is what this property means for the internal a\u00a4airs of large versus small countries. Countries that are small in world markets, and who therefore have no impact on world prices when they make their unilateral policy choices, enjoy a greater degree of policy indepen- dence \u0096and hence, according to Bagwell and Staiger\u0092 s de nition, possess a wider set of policies that qualify as their internal a\u00a4airs and therefore a wider domain of sovereign rights \u0096than countries that are large in world markets and therefore impact world prices, facing the implied additional degree of interdependence when making their unilateral policy choices. I return to this property below. In any case, with a de nition of internal a\u00a4airs in hand, the broad approach taken by Bagwell and Staiger to evaluate the design features of the GATT/WTO with respect to issues of national sovereignty can now be described as follows. In a rst step, the normal operation of a country\u0092 s domestic institutions in the domain of its internal a\u00a4airs is characterized. This amounts to a consideration of the way in which the preferences of the country\u0092 s citizens would be translated into choices over the policy instruments that lie in the domain of its internal a\u00a4airs if those choices were made in the absence of any international agreement. And then, in a second step, an international agreement is said to violate the sovereignty of a member state \u0096that is, one state has intervened in the internal a\u00a4airs of an- other state as a result of the international agreement \u0096whenever the international agreement leads the government of a country to make external commitments over matters that (i) concern the country\u0092 s internal a\u00a4airs or (ii) alter (and there- fore distort/derange) the normal operations of the country\u0092 s domestic institutions within the domain of its internal a\u00a4airs.160 Adopting the perspective of the terms-of-trade theory of trade agreements and therefore working in a setting where the externality variable is the world price pw, Bagwell and Staiger demonstrate that market access commitments \u0096de ned as a commitment to conditions of competition between domestic producers and foreign exporters (see note 25), and therefore as a commitment to a speci c level of im- port volume when foreign exporters price at pw\u0096fall outside the domain of a large country\u0092 s internal a\u00a4airs, while the particular policies employed to deliver a level of market access are the country\u0092 s internal a\u00a4airs. As such Bagwell and Staiger are avoided, and they also consider when this tradeo\u00a4 will necessarily arise. 160So as not to necessarily tie all of my statements about sovereignty in this book to the particular formalization of that term that is put forward by Bagwell and Staiger (2018) and described here, throughout the earlier chapters whenever I have used the term sovereignty I mean it in an informal sense along the lines consistent with common usage of the term. 229able to conclude that international agreements that entail market access commit- ments for large countries do not by themselves violate national sovereignty. What would violate a country\u0092 s sovereignty according to this perspective are commit- ments to the details of the policies that the country will employ to deliver its market access commitments, or commitments that distort the normal operation of the country\u0092 s institutions relevant for the determination of these policies. In short, in environments where the terms-of-trade theory applies, the for- malization of national sovereignty developed by Bagwell and Staiger implies that shallow integration commitments do not violate a country\u0092 s sovereignty as long as those commitments are interpreted as commitments to a level of market access. But deep integration commitments that pin down the details of the country\u0092 s market-access relevant policies or distort the normal operation of the domestic institutions that determine those policies would violate the country\u0092 s sovereignty. Armed with this conclusion, and exploiting the implications of the terms-of- trade theory regarding the nature of the ine\u00a2 ciency that a trade agreement must solve as described in chapter 2, it is then a short step to the further conclusion that, in a world of two large countries, a market access agreement between them can achieve the international e\u00a2 ciency frontier without violating the sovereignty of either country. Moreover, when a multi-country world economy is considered where all countries are large in world markets, Bagwell and Staiger demonstrate that a commitment to non-discriminatory tari\u00a4s as implied by MFN would not violate any country\u0092 s sovereignty either. Intuitively, for large countries discrimina- tory tari\u00a4s make possible certain market access choices that would be impossible under MFN; but as already noted, market access choices are not the internal af- fairs of a large country, and so restrictions can be placed on these choices through voluntary international agreement without violating national sovereignty. This last point is important, because as Bagwell and Staiger demonstrate it allows them to conclude that if some (but not all) countries are large, then achieving international e\u00a2 ciency and preserving national sovereignty are mutu- ally consistent goals of an international agreement if and only if the agreement is limited to MFN market access commitments. In particular, they nd that \u0093po- litically optimal\u0094market access agreements (i.e., market access agreements that implement the politically optimal policies as de ned in chapter 2) that are also non-discriminatory and therefore conform to MFN provide the unique path to achieving international e\u00a2 ciency while preserving national sovereignty in this set- ting. To see why, recall that, as I mentioned above, small countries enjoy a greater degree of policy independence and thus a wider domain of sovereign rights than 230large countries. In fact, Bagwell and Staiger show that market access choices fall into the domain of internal a\u00a4airs for small countries, implying that in any inter- national agreement that does not violate their sovereignty small countries must be left unconstrained to choose their best-response policies and implied market ac- cess levels. This requirement is consistent with international e\u00a2 ciency according to the terms-of-trade theory, but as Bagwell and Staiger show only when all tari\u00a4s are non-discriminatory and the MFN politically optimal tari\u00a4s are implemented. Taken together, these ndings have potentially important implications for the design of the GATT/WTO and its ability to facilitate globalization while respect- ing the sovereignty of its member governments. As I have described in previous chapters, the GATT/WTO has from its inception been concerned most fundamen- tally with non-discriminatory market access commitments, and it has traditionally sought to anchor these commitments with negotiations over border measures (e.g., tari\u00a4s) that are \u0093multilateralized\u0094through the MFN requirement and secured by a set of GATT Articles that serve as \u0093market access preservation rules.\u0094The nd- ings described above suggest that this tradition could be a winning combination for achieving international policy e\u00a2 ciency while preserving national sovereignty, at least in environments where the terms-of-trade theory applies. But this tradition is being eroded on two fronts. First, the prevalence of discriminatory trade agreements has increased dramatically in recent decades, diminishing adherence to the MFN principle as a practical matter in the global economy. And second, increasingly trade agreements are becoming a forum for the negotiation of international commitments on a host of behind-the-border policies. As I have suggested in previous chapters, to some extent these developments may be the result of changes in the nature of the problems that trade agreements are being asked to solve, away from the problem identi ed by the terms-of-trade theory and toward novel forms of international externalities. Whatever the drivers of these developments, the ndings described here convey a clear message: the further the WTO and the world trading system that it governs departs from a reliance on agreements that take the form of non-discriminatory market access commitments, the more likely it will be that these agreements pose a threat (and possibly, an avoidable one) to the sovereignty of the member countries. Finally, I have omitted from my discussion of sovereignty those issues that are associated with the operation of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body, but of course those issues have also become critical in the globalization debate, especially in recent years as the United States has taken actions which have led to the breakdown of the appeals process at the WTO. At issue here is the appropriate 231level of \u0093activism\u0094for the WTO court. For example, after describing the WTO Appellate Body\u0092 s (AB) interpretation of the term \u0093public body\u0094 which had the e\u00a4ect of limiting the scope for using WTO rules to respond to the competitive distortions associated with China\u0092 s state-owned enterprises, Matthes (2021, p. 18) describes the issue this way: From this viewpoint, the AB acted as a normal court in interpreting rules and established a new meaning pertaining to WTO law. However, the US holds the opinion that the AB is not a usual court but should stick very closely to WTO law... In essence the debate is about whether to stick with the WTO legal system, pos- sibly circumscribed in various ways to rein in the mandate of panel and appellate body judges, or rather to return to something less formal and closer to the orig- inal GATT legal system. And while the tactics used by the United States in the context of this debate have been very disruptive to the operations of the WTO, what is at stake in this debate \u0096the appropriate level of court activism \u0096does not pose an existential threat to the WTO in the way that the tensions between international e\u00a2 ciency and national sovereignty that I have highlighted here do.161 12.2. The declining hegemon In chapter 5 I described how the Trump tari\u00a4s might be interpreted as a crude at- tempt by the Trump Administration to implement the vision of the global trading system articulated by Trump\u0092 s Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in the passage I quoted in chapter 1. In particular, as I observed in chapter 5, Mattoo and Staiger (2020) argue that these actions amount to a US-led e\u00a4ort to repeal the rules-based trading system and replace it with a power-based system where countries are free to bargain in a way that is not constrained by a particular set of agreed-upon rules of behavior. And as Mattoo and Staiger note, while the Trump Adminis- tration accelerated the US move away from the rules-based trading system and toward a power-based approach, it was not the rst US Administration to move in this direction.162In this section I elaborate further on Mattoo and Staiger\u0092 s explanation for why this might be happening now. 161See also the discussion of Maggi and Staiger (2011) in chapter 6, where some of the issues associated with court activism are covered. 162Evidence of power-based bargaining could be seen in the strategy used by the major players in the GATT Uruguay Round to deal with \u0093holdout\u0094countries in creating the WTO, namely, withdrawing from GATT and acceding to the newly formed WTO (see Posner and Sykes, 2014). 232Mattoo and Staiger begin from the observation that the rules-based system of the GATT/WTO has two main potential advantages over a power-based approach to tari\u00a4 bargaining. First, the rules of the GATT/WTO can simplify the tari\u00a4 bargaining problem and make it manageable, and this can help countries negotiate to more e\u00a2 cient policies. Chapters 4 and 5 have reviewed evidence consistent with this position, and in principle all countries could share in the implied e\u00a2 ciency gains generated by a rules-based system. Second, these rules tend to mitigate the power of the most powerful countries \u0096in chapter 5 I discussed some evidence in support of this position as well \u0096and in so doing can encourage the participation of weaker countries in the global trading system, who might otherwise be vulnerable to exploitation by the stronger countries and choose to opt out altogether. It is on this second potential advantage of a rules-based trading system that Mattoo and Staiger focus their attention. In essence, as I now describe, they argue that the rules-based trading system may be in peril as a result of the erosion that has occurred over the past several decades in the dominant position of the United States in the world economy, due to the implications of this development for the ability of the rules-based system to generate participation bene ts of a magnitude that would justify continued US submission to the rules. That commitment to a rules-based system could generate participation bene ts that are su\u00a2 ciently large to justify a powerful country\u0092 s submission to those rules is illustrated in a stylistic way for a two-country world in Figure 12.1, which builds on McLaren (1997) and is adapted from Figure 5B of Bagwell and Staiger (1999). In this gure, the welfare of the domestic country, W, is plotted on the vertical axis and the welfare of the foreign country, W\u0003, is plotted on the horizontal axis. The dashed frontier depicted in the gure represents the combinations of domestic and foreign welfare levels achievable under e\u00a2 cient tari\u00a4 bargaining. The welfare levels at the origin of the gure, labeled Nex-post , represent the \u0093disagreement point\u0094 for the two countries: these are the welfare levels that the domestic and foreign countries would achieve if their tari\u00a4bargaining broke down. And the point on the frontier labeled PBis the outcome of the power-based bargain, assuming that both the domestic and the foreign country participate in the bargain and that this bargain can be represented as a Nash bargain that reaches the highest iso-Nash-Product contour (the dashed iso-Nash-Product contour labeled in the gure asIso NP ) consistent with the dashed frontier. As depicted, at the point PBboth countries achieve higher welfare than their disagreement welfare levels at Nex-post , indicating that each country does better under the agreement summarized by the point PBthan it would do by walking away from the deal. 233But these disagreement welfare levels may not be the relevant welfare levels for assessing whether the decision to participate in the bargain is worthwhile. This is because the act of showing up at the bargaining table to participate in the bargain may itself imply incurring some sunk costs, economic or political, which cannot then be recouped should the bargaining break down, and which are therefore netted out from the welfare levels at Nex-post . Under the assumption that the foreign country is the weaker, smaller, country of the two and that it experiences such sunk costs when it agrees to participate in a tari\u00a4 bargain with the larger more powerful domestic country (perhaps because its exporters will sink investments into serving the large domestic-country market once it is known that the two countries have agreed to bargain), the disagreement point relevant for the participation decision \u0096which excludes the sunk costs that would be incurred by showing up \u0096 is labeled in Figure 12.1 as Nex-ante . The gure depicts the case where, under power-based bargaining, the foreign country does worse than if it had not shown up to the bargaining table; hence, anticipating this, it will choose not to participate in such a bargain and the two countries will be stuck at their (ex-ante) disagreement welfare levels. Figure 12.1 This is where the commitment to a rules-based system could bene t all coun- 234tries, including the most powerful countries. Here I illustrate the impact of com- mitting to the reciprocity rule as it arises in the context of GATT Article XXVIII renegotiation. Recall from the discussion in chapter 4 that if a powerful country pushes for better-than-reciprocal terms in an e\u00a2 cient bargain, its trading part- ner can subsequently renegotiate subject to reciprocity, introducing ine\u00a2 ciencies in the bargaining outcome that are borne by the powerful country and serve to penalize it for exercising its power in the bargain. The implications of this are illustrated in Figure 12.1 by the solid welfare frontier, which lies everywhere in- side the dashed frontier except at the point marked S, where each country has set its tari\u00a4s at the levels it would have chosen if it were a small country, and therefore where no country is exerting bargaining power to push the deal in its favor.163The Nash bargain in the presence of this reciprocity-constrained frontier would then deliver the rules-based bargaining outcome labeled RBin Figure 12.1, which marks the highest iso-Nash-Product contour (the solid iso-Nash-Product contour labeled in the gure as Iso NP ) consistent with the solid frontier. As illustrated in Figure 12.1, the rules-based bargaining outcome RBpenalizes the powerful domestic country and favors the weaker foreign country relative to the power-based bargaining outcome PB; but for the powerful domestic country this is no loss, since it could not get the foreign country to participate in power-based bargaining in any event. And relative to their ex-ante disagreement welfare levels, both countries now do better under the rules-based bargaining outcome RB. The discussion here suggests that the most powerful countries may bene t from a rules-based multilateral trading system precisely because they areso powerful. As I noted in chapter 1, this may help explain why the United States was, along with the United Kingdom, the champion of the rules-based system at its creation in 1947 with the birth of GATT. But it is not hard to see from Figure 12.1 that, if the domestic country were the more powerful of the two but not so dominantly more powerful as I have illustrated in the gure, the foreign country could well choose to participate in trade bargaining even under a power-based system. And in that case, the more powerful domestic country would prefer to escape from the rules and pursue power-based trade bargaining with the now-participating foreign country (assuming that the e\u00a2 ciency bene ts of rules-based bargaining noted above were not large enough to carry the day on their own). This suggests the possibility that, with the rise of the large emerging and developing economies and the decline in hegemonic status that the United States has experienced in recent decades, its enthusiasm for the rules-based system it 163This point corresponds to the political optimum as de ned in chapter 2. 235helped to create could wane: being far less dominant in the global economy than it was in 1947, the United States is no longer in need of a set of international rules to help it commit not to exploit other countries in trade bargaining so that they feel comfortable engaging in the global economy. And if the declining hegemonic position of the United States is indeed a primary cause of the challenges now facing the rules-based multilateral trading system, to repair that system the world may have to wait for the rise of another hegemon. It is this possibility that Mattoo and Staiger describe, and which is illustrated in stylistic fashion in Figure 12.2, reproduced from Mattoo and Staiger (2020). Figure 12.2 (Reproduced from Mattoo and Staiger, 2020) With the passage of time measured from left to right on the horizontal axis, Figure 12.2 depicts in a schematic way a hypothetical evolution in the world trad- ing system, from a rules-based system to a power-based system and back again. This evolution is driven by an exogenous process in which one country, referred to as \u0093the U.S.,\u0094experiences an erosion over time in its position of hegemony atop the world economy, while a second country, referred to as \u0093China,\u0094ascends to this position of hegemony. For simplicity, countries are assumed to be myopic, and the choice between a rules-based and a power-based trading system in any period is assumed to be determined by the more powerful country in that period, who 236decides whether it will subject itself to rules for the period under consideration.164 The thick solid lines in Figure 12.2 depict the equilibrium payo\u00a4s of each country under the equilibrium regime choice in each period, and as depicted, the periods can be separated into four phases that re\u0087 ect these equilibrium regime choices. In the U.S. Hegemony phase, the United States chooses to tie its hands in a rules-based regime. This is because during this phase, the weak country (China) can credibly threaten not to bargain with the United States in the absence of rules, and hence the United States must rely on rules to induce China\u0092 s participation, much like the situation illustrated in Figure 12.1. This feature is re\u0087 ected in Figure 12.2 by the fact that in the U.S. Hegemony phase the payo\u00a4 to China under power-based bargaining (dashed red line), while above China\u0092 s ex post once- the-bargaining-has-begun Nash payo\u00a4 (dash-dotted thin red line), is below its ex ante Nash payo\u00a4 (thin red line), that is, below the payo\u00a4 China could expect if it simply stayed away from the bargaining table and never let the bargaining process get o\u00a4 the ground. And so the payo\u00a4s for the two countries under a power-based regime would be their (ex ante) Nash payo\u00a4s (thin blue line for the United States, thin red line for China) which, re\u0087 ecting the positive-sum gains from bargaining and the assumption that these gains are split evenly in the rules-based bargain, are below the payo\u00a4s that each country would receive when bargaining under the rules-based regime, depicted by the horizontal green line in the gure. Hence the rules-based regime will be implemented in the U.S. Hegemony phase. In the U.S. Dominance phase, the United States does better in a power-based regime than a rules-based regime and chooses to withdraw support from the rules- based regime and escape from the constraints of the rules-based system that it once created. During this phase, China would like to threaten not to bargain with the United States in the absence of rules, but unlike in the U.S. Hegemony phase this threat is not credible, and hence the United States does not need to rely on rules to induce China\u0092 s participation. This is because in the U.S. Dominance phase the payo\u00a4 to China under power-based bargaining (thick red line) has now risen above China\u0092 s ex ante Nash payo\u00a4 (thin red line), and so China is willing to participate in power-based bargaining with the United States; and initially, at the border between the U.S. Hegemony and U.S. Dominance phases, the United 164As Mattoo and Staiger note, the assumption that the relatively more powerful country determines the regime can be formalized in a 2-stage game in which, in stage 1, the more powerful country decides whether or not to commit to rules for bargaining, and then in stage 2, the more powerful country invites the weaker country to bargain, an invitation that the weaker country can either accept or reject. 237States payo\u00a4 (thick blue line) captures all the gains from the bargain relative to the ex ante Nash payo\u00a4s. The power-based payo\u00a4s of the two countries converge in Figure 12.2 at the border between U.S. Dominance and China Dominance where the two countries are equally powerful, and then the payo\u00a4s of the United States and China play mirror image roles as the world moves through the China Dominance phase and nally to the China Hegemony phase.165The remaining phases are then mirror images of the rst two phases just described. In the China Dominance phase, China now does better in a power-based regime than a rules- based regime and chooses not to support a rules-based regime. And nally, in the China Hegemony phase, China chooses to tie its hands in a rules-based regime. According to Mattoo and Staiger\u0092 s interpretation, the erosion of US support for the rules-based system is not likely to be a short-term temporary phenomenon that will be reversed now that the Trump Administration has ended. Moreover, if Figure 12.2 embodies the correct diagnosis, it is a diagnosis that is full of irony. According to this diagnosis, the design of the rules-based multilateral trading sys- tem has proven e\u00a4ective in solving an important and still-relevant problem, yet the system will inevitably collapse. While there may be nothing fundamentally wrong with the existing rules-based system, there are certainly important improvements in the design of the rules that could be made, yet such improvements will likely do nothing to save the system. And while China is seen by many as a source of some of the greatest challenges for the rules-based trading system of the twenty- rst century, if this diagnosis is correct it may be that the rise of China is the world\u0092 s best hope for the return of a viable rules-based multilateral trading system. 12.3. The WTO\u0092 s role in preparing for the next pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic that began in the winter of 2020 has shaken the entire world, and the world trading system has certainly not been spared. The challenges created for the WTO by this pandemic are many and varied, though they are not new: public health researchers and economists have been concerned for some time that the growing interdependence engendered by globalization carries increasing risks of disease transmission across countries, and there have been calls for the WTO to address this concern (see, for example, Mackey and Liang, 2012, and more 165That the power-based payo\u00a4s of the two countries converge to their rules-based payo\u00a4s at the border between U.S. Dominance and China Dominance in Figure 12.2 re\u0087 ects an assumption that power-based and rules-based bargaining are equally e\u00a2 cient. See Mattoo and Staiger (2020) for a depiction of the case where rules-based bargaining is more e\u00a2 cient than power-based bargaining. 238recently Hoekman, 2020, and the papers discussed therein). But the COVID-19 pandemic has brought these risks into sharp focus, laying bare for the world trading system a number of serious and interrelated challenges that have the potential to erupt during pandemics, ranging from supply chain disruption to issues relating to erratic vaccine distribution and associated patent rights to the imposition of export restrictions on personal protective equipment (PPE). What is the WTO\u0092 s role in meeting these challenges, and in helping countries prepare for the next pandemic? The World Health Organization (WHO) is the institution tasked with addressing international health issues, and the appropriate role for issue linkage between the WTO and the WHO as well as other interna- tional agencies must be a central concern in any comprehensive answer to this question.166Here I focus on a narrow slice of this question: Can WTO rules be e\u00a4ective in preventing governments from imposing export restrictions during a pandemic?; And relatedly, what is the appropriate balance for the WTO between that goal and the goal of encouraging trade-related public health measures that would reduce the probability of a pandemic in the rst place? I examine these questions through the lens of the enforcement constraints with which a trade agreement such as the GATT/WTO must contend (see, for example, Dam, 1970, and Bagwell and Staiger, 2002, chapter 6). In particular, as there is no world jail into which national leaders can be thrown if they vio- late GATT/WTO commitments, meaningful commitments in the GATT/WTO, like meaningful commitments in any international trade agreement, must be self enforcing, so that the member governments see it in their self-interest to follow through on commitments. Adopting a modeling approach to self-enforcing trade agreements similar to Bagwell and Staiger (1990) and highlighting the basic incen- tive constraint that a self-enforcing agreement must obey, I argue below that there are good reasons to expect export restraints to move closer to non-cooperative lev- els during a pandemic when the commitments made in a trade agreement must be self enforcing, re\u0087 ecting the fact that during a pandemic e\u00a4orts to maintain fully cooperative export policy will be especially fraught. And I argue that when the possibility of encouraging policy commitments that could reduce the probabil- ity of a pandemic is also considered, looking to a trade agreement as a forum for blunting the use of export restraints during a pandemic can be counter-productive. These points can be formalized with the aid of a simple model. To keep the analysis focused, I consider a two-country partial equilibrium \u0093endowment- 166On the role that the WHO and other international agencies can play in prevention, pre- paredness and response to pandemics, see chapter 4 of National Research Council (2016). 239economy\u0094world, where the home country is endowed with a xed amount of good yand the foreign country is endowed with a xed amount of good x, and where x andymight be thought of as two di\u00a4erent forms of PPE (or possibly one form of PPE and a vaccine, but I will use the term PPE as shorthand). Aside from their endowment structure, I will assume that the two countries are otherwise identical in every way, and therefore the home country will import xand export ywhile the foreign country imports yand exports x. For simplicity I focus on the use of tax instruments to restrict trade rather than quotas, though the qualitative nature of the conclusions I emphasize below do not depend on this.167And I abstract from import tari\u00a4s and focus instead on the use of export taxes, with the home-country tax on exports of good ydenoted by yand the foreign country tax on exports of good xdenoted by \u0003 x. The simpli cation of endowment economies means that an export tax is equivalent to a subsidy to local consumption of the export good. This simpli cation allows me to focus on export taxes but abstract from the production distortions that would otherwise arise with their use. In each period, there is a chance that a new virus will be introduced into the human population and lead to a pandemic. If a pandemic occurs in a period, I assume that it lasts for the period and then exogenously ends. Hence, governments can do nothing to impact the duration of a pandemic if it occurs. But I assume that governments can impact the chance that a pandemic occurs in the rst place. In particular at the beginning of each period, the home and foreign countries have an opportunity to invest in public health measures IandI\u0003for the period and incur costs c(I)andc(I\u0003), respectively. These investments determine the probability that a new virus jumps from the animal to the human population and leads to a pandemic in the period, which I summarize with the reduced- form pandemic probability function \u001a(I;I\u0003), with\u001a(I;I\u0003)2(0;1)for allIand I\u0003. I assume that c(\u0001)is increasing and convex in its argument, and I assume that\u001a(I;I\u0003)is decreasing and concave in each of its arguments. Therefore, the probability that a pandemic occurs in any period, \u001a(I;I\u0003), is jointly determined by the public health investments made by the two countries in that period and falls as those investments rise. These investments are a stand in for public health measures designed to prevent a virus of animal origin from jumping to the human population, or for standards and regulations that could help stop a new virus of animal origin that has jumped to the human population from taking hold in 167The modeling framework of Bagwell and Staiger (1990) on which I build can handle both tari\u00a4s and quotas, and as Bagwell and Staiger demonstrate the qualitative predictions of the model are robust to the choice of policy instrument. 240the population su\u00a2 ciently to become a pandemic. Of course in reality these same kinds of investments might impact the duration of a pandemic, not just the chance that a pandemic occurs in the rst place; but by assuming that the probability of a pandemic in any period is endogenous while the duration of a pandemic if it occurs is exogenous, I keep the model simple and focused on the main points.168 In a period where the pandemic occurs, the home country su\u00a4ers a welfare loss equal toC(Dx;Dy), whereCis the pandemic loss function assumed to be positive, decreasing and convex in both of its arguments, and where DxandDyare the home-country consumption levels of good xandy, respectively, that correspond to points on downward-sloping demand curves. I have in mind that the welfare cost of a pandemic to the home country is diminished when its consumption of either form of PPE is increased during the pandemic, but that these bene ts are (local) externalities when viewed by the individual consumer in the home country (and hence enter into the function C(Dx;Dy)rather than into home country consumer surplus). Similarly, for the foreign country I assume that in a period where the pandemic occurs it su\u00a4ers a welfare loss equal to C(D\u0003 x;D\u0003 y)withD\u0003 xandD\u0003 ythe foreign-country consumption levels of good xandy, respectively. I will sometimes refer to a period where the pandemic occurs as the \u0093pandemic state\u0094of the world and to the no-pandemic state as \u0093normal times.\u0094 Consider now the welfare measures for the two countries. At the time that the export taxes yand \u0003 xfor the period are chosen, public health investments for the period are a bygone and the state of the world (pandemic or no pandemic) for the period is known. In normal times, home and foreign welfare for the period are given by the usual economic surplus measures !=X measures are covered under the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) and the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS). For a discussion in the context of COVID-19 of public health measures that are aimed at preventing a virus of animal origin from jumping to the human population, see WTO (2020a). For a discussion of standards and regulations that could help prevent a new virus of animal origin that has jumped to the human population from taking hold in the population su\u00a2 ciently to become a pandemic, see WTO (2020b). See Burris, Anderson and Wagenaar (2021) on the importance of appropriate laws and regulations for e\u00a4ective pandemic control more generally. 241with world welfare then good i2fx;ygand PSyandTRyare respectively home-country producer surplus and and where CS\u0003 i,PS\u0003 xandTR\u0003 xare similarly de ned for the foreign and where I use \u0016 yand\u0016 \u0003 xto denote the home and foreign export taxes that are applied in normal times. In the pandemic state, home and foreign welfare for the period are given by economic surplus minus the welfare loss from the pandemic, !PAN with world welfare in the given by the home and foreign export taxes applied during a pandemic. Unlike export taxes, at the time that the public health investment levels Iand I\u0003are chosen in each period the state of the world for the period has not yet been determined, and so what is relevant for the choice of investment levels is ex-ante expected welfare. Each country\u0092 s ex-ante expected welfare for the period is given by its expected economic surplus minus its expected loss from a pandemic, or W= [1\u0000\u001a(I;I\u0003)]\u0002fX ex-ante-world-welfare-maximizing) policy choices in this setting, I rst consider the choice of export taxes conditional on each state of the world, and then consider the choice of (ex-ante) investment policies. In normal times, as expected there is no e\u00a2 ciency role for trade tax intervention, and hence the e\u00a2 cient export taxes that maximize the expression for !win (12.2) are given by \u0016 e y= 0 = \u0016 \u0003e x. In the pandemic state, the rst-order conditions associated with (12.4) that maximize which given the convexity of Cand the cross-country symmetry assumptions I have imposed imply that, again, ^ e y= 0 = ^ \u0003e xand there is no e\u00a2 ciency role 243for trade tax intervention. Intuitively, in the pandemic state there is no role for trade taxes for the purpose of maximizing worldwide economic surplus, and cross- country symmetry ensures that under free trade the supply (endowment) of each form of PPE in the world will be allocated equally across countries and therefore so as to minimize C(Dx;Dy) +C(D\u0003 x;D\u0003 y), the worldwide cost of the pandemic. Now consider the e\u00a2 cient choice of public health investments IeandI\u0003e. These are the choices of IandI\u0003that maximize the ex ante world welfare Wwde ned in (12.7) when Wwis evaluated at the e\u00a2 cient export taxes (i.e., free trade in all states). The associated rst-order conditions imply that use the superscript \u0093e\u0094 to denote a magnitude that is evaluated at the e\u00a2 cient export taxes. As (12.9) indicates, the e\u00a2 cient choice of public health investment in each country, IeandI\u0003e, equates the marginal bene t of a small increase in investment in terms of reduced expected worldwide welfare loss from a pandemic in the period to the marginal cost of the investment. What are the non-cooperative policies in this setting? The non-cooperative (Nash) export tax choices in normal times, which I denote by \u0016 N yand\u0016 \u0003N x, are describe the export taxes that each coun- try would choose to maximize its own economic surplus, and these export taxes amount to the usual Johnson (1953-54) optimal tari\u00a4s. By contrast, the non- cooperative export tax choices in the pandemic state, which I denote by ^ N yand ^ \u0003N x, are de by of (12.11), the second term is a product of two terms: a negative term by the properties of the pandemic loss function, and a positive term given downward-sloping demand and the impact of export taxes on local prices. As a comparison of (12.10) and (12.11) makes clear, in a pandemic state the same optimal tari\u00a4 incentives are at work as those that de ne the non-cooperative export taxes in normal times, but in the pandemic state there is also something more: each country has an incentive to use its export tax to keep more PPE for its own citizens, in order to reduce the welfare losses experienced by its citizens during the pandemic. The two incentives reinforce each other and push toward higher export taxes, ensuring that ^ N y>\u0016 N yand^ \u0003N x>\u0016 \u0003N x. But the optimal tari\u00a4 incentives that prevent the export tax from becoming prohibitive in normal times can be swamped in the pandemic state by the incentive to hoard PPE, leading a country to adopt prohibitive export taxes in the pandemic state if this latter incentive is strong enough: whether this occurs or not will depend on the properties of the pandemic loss function C, and in particular on the magnitude of @C(Dx;Dy) @Dyand@C(D\u0003 x;D\u0003 y) @D\u0003x, re\u0087 ecting the degree to which this loss function is sensitive to the amount of PPE its citizens consume. Finally, the Nash public health investment levels INandI\u0003Nare de ned by the rst-order conditions where I use the superscript \u0093N\u0094to denote a magnitude that is evaluated at the non-cooperative trade taxes for the relevant state (in the context of (12.12), the pandemic state). As is intuitive, (12.12) implies that, unlike the e\u00a2 cient invest- ment levels de ned by (12.9), the non-cooperative levels of investments in public health only take into account the bene ts experienced by the country making the investment and are therefore too low relative to e\u00a2 cient levels, as each country ignores the bene cial impact of its investment on its trading partner. Given the unilateral incentives that each country has to make ine\u00a2 cient public health investment and export tax choices, can e\u00a2 cient choices be sustained in a self-enforcing agreement in this setting? The answer is yes if and only if the future cost borne by a country that deviates from e\u00a2 cient policy choices is large enough to outweigh the one-time gain that it can achieve from the deviation. This describes the basic incentive constraint that a self-enforcing agreement must obey. 245To see whether e\u00a2 cient choices can be sustained in a self-enforcing agreement in this setting, it is necessary to consider in some detail the incentive constraints that are implied by the self-enforcement requirement. To this end I will assume that policy deviations from the agreement are only observed by the other party at the end of the period. Moreover, for simplicity I will follow Bagwell and Staiger (1990) and assume that any deviation from the policies that the countries agree to will be met by in nite Nash reversion beginning in the next period. These assumptions ensure that if a country were to deviate in a period from its agreed public health investment level, it would deviate in that period also with respect to its agreed export tax level regardless of which state of the world prevails (be- cause once it deviates from the agreed investment level in a period it will trigger the punishment beginning next period no matter what export tax it chooses for the period, so it might as well choose its unilaterally optimal export tax). This feature is special, but it helps to illustrate in stark terms the more general points that I highlight below, and it reduces the taxonomy of deviation and punishment possibilities that I would otherwise need to consider. What is the future cost borne by a country who deviates from the policy choices speci ed in the agreement? When viewed from a period in which a government is considering deviating, the cost to the country of the in nite Nash reversion that would follow this deviation beginning in the next period is the discounted di\u00a4er- ence between its expected future welfare under the cooperative policies dictated by the agreement and its expected future welfare under the Nash policies. Assuming for the moment that the agreement calls for e\u00a2 cient public health investments and export tax levels, the per-period cost to the home country of forgoing the agreement and reverting to Nash is then \u0007e\u0011W(\u0016 de ned by (12.5). And discounting the in nite stream of per-period costs with the discount factor \u000e, back to the current period where the deviation is under consideration, yields the future cost borne by the home country if it deviates in the current period from the e\u00a2 cient policy choices speci ed in the agreement: \u000e 1\u0000\u000e\u0007e: (12.13) In light of the cross-country symmetry of the model, (12.13) also gives the future cost borne by the foreign country if it deviates from the policy choices speci ed in the agreement. Importantly, as (12.13) re\u0087 ects, regardless of whether the current 246period where the deviation is under consideration corresponds to a pandemic or to normal times, the future cost borne by a country who deviates from the policy choices speci ed in the agreement always looks the same.169 What is the one-time gain that a country can achieve from deviating? Focusing again on the home country, there are three relevant possibilities for a deviation from the e\u00a2 cient policies called for in the agreement. The home country could deviate from its agreed public health investment level, which it would have to do before the state of the world for the period is determined; then, as noted above, it would deviate as well from its agreed export tax regardless of which state of the world obtains in that period. Alternatively, the home country could make the agreed public health investment, and then deviate from the agreed export tax only if a pandemic occurs, or only during normal times. Consider the last option rst, that is, the home country invests in public health as prescribed under the agreement and then deviates from the agreed export tax \u0016 e y(free trade) if times turn out to be normal (there is no pandemic for the period). In this case the one-period gain from deviating to \u0016 N ywhen times are normal is y;\u0016 \u0003e x)\u0000!(\u0016 e y;\u0016 \u0003e x)where!is de ned by (12.1), implying that this deviation is not pro table for the home country and \u0016 e ycan be part of a self-enforcing agreement if and only (12.14) is the incentive constraint associated with the home- country choice of \u0016 y, with an analogous incentive constraint applying to the foreign-country choice of \u0016 \u0003 x. As (12.1) con rms, the left-hand side of (12.14) re\u0087 ects the usual incentive to manipulate the terms of trade with an export tax, and if the one-period gain from such opportunistic behavior is not too large and/or the discount factor \u000eis large enough, the inequality in (12.14) will be met, the home country will see it in its own self-interest to follow through on its export-tax commitment, and the e\u00a2 cient home-country export tax \u0016 e ywill be sustainable as part of a self-enforcing agreement, with an identical statement holding for \u0016 \u0003e x. Next suppose that the home country invests in public health as prescribed under the agreement and then deviates from the agreed export tax ^ e y(free trade) if there is a pandemic. In this case the one-period gain from deviating to ^ N yif the 169This property re\u0087 ects the i.i.d. nature of the pandemic shock as I have modeled it, a feature that is also shared by the shocks studied by Bagwell and Staiger (1990). See Bagwell and Staiger (2003) for an analysis of self-enforcing trade agreements in the presence of persistent shocks. 247pandemic arrives is given by !PAN(^ N y;^ \u0003e x)\u0000!PAN(^ e y;^ \u0003e x)where!is de ned by (12.3), implying that this deviation is not pro table for the home country and ^ e y is sustainable as part of a self-enforcing agreement if and only if (12.15) is the incentive constraint associated with the home- country choice of ^ y, with an analogous incentive constraint applying to the foreign-country choice of ^ \u0003 x. Notice, though, that with \u0016 e y= 0 = ^ e yand\u0016 \u0003e x= 0 = ^ \u0003e xand hence with free trade the e\u00a2 cient export tax in both normal times and during a pandemic, we have by (12.1) and (12.3) that !PAN(^ e y;^ \u0003e must also !PAN(^ N the sides of the incentive constraints in (12.15) and (12.14) are the same, (12.16) indicates that the left-hand side of the incentive constraint that applies during a pandemic, (12.15), must be bigger than the left- hand side of the incentive constraint that applies during normal times, (12.14), implying that in a self-enforcing agreement it will be harder to sustain e\u00a2 cient export taxes during a pandemic than in normal times. For example, if the discount factor\u000eis such that the incentive constraint on \u0016 ydescribed by (12.14) holds with equality, then (12.16) indicates that the incentive constraint on ^ ydescribed by (12.15) must be violated. Intuitively, this re\u0087 ects two key ingredients. First, the non-cooperative export tax \u0016 N yis higher than the e\u00a2 cient level \u0016 e yeven in normal 248times, due to the unilateral incentive to manipulate the terms of trade. And second, even if it deviated only to \u0016 N yduring a pandemic, the one-time gain from this deviation for the home country would rise during the pandemic, because in addition to enjoying the same terms-of-trade gains that the home country would enjoy in normal times, in a pandemic the home country would also enjoy the PPE- hoarding gains that come from the higher-than-e\u00a2 cient export tax; and deviating to the optimal deviation-export-tax level ^ N ythat applies during a pandemic can only further increase this one-time gain. This does not mean that cooperation over export restrictions must break down during a pandemic. As Bagwell and Staiger (1990) show, countries can manage the incentive to defect from an agreement, by adjusting the trade policies that they agree to implement under the agreement toward the non-cooperative lev- els, thereby preventing the incentive constraints from ever being violated and keeping the agreement intact, even as it is bu\u00a4eted by various external shocks. In the present context that would mean building in to the agreement the \u0087 ex- ibility to allow export taxes to rise somewhat during pandemics, in an implicit acknowledgment that the agreement must be self enforcing and the implied incen- tive constraints on export restrictions are especially demanding in a pandemic.170 Indeed, this provides one interpretation of the \u0093escape\u0094 provisions included in GATT that have become the main avenue through which countries have imposed export restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic.171Note, however, that un- less the discount factor is su\u00a2 ciently high so that incentive constraints never bind at the e\u00a2 cient policies, this does mean that some e\u00a2 ciency will by necessity be sacri ced during a pandemic; and depending on the properties of the pandemic loss function C, it is possible that the \u0093most-cooperative\u0094 agreement (i.e., the agreement that implements the policies closest to the e\u00a2 cient policies while not violating any incentive constraints) would by necessity permit export taxes during 170Such an adjustment in the agreed policies reduces the one-time gain from deviation, but it also reduces the per-period bene ts from maintaining the agreement. As Bagwell and Staiger (1990) show, in their model the former e\u00a4ect is larger than the latter so that an adjustment of this kind can always be found that brings the incentive constraint into compliance. The same property can be shown to hold in the present setting. 171See Congressional Research Service (2021). For example, though GATT Article XI provides for the general elimination of quantitative restrictions on trade, including limitations on exports, it exempts \u0093[e]xport prohibitions or restrictions temporarily applied to prevent or relieve critical shortages of foodstu\u00a4s or other products essential to the exporting contracting party.\u0094 And GATT Article XX carves out from GATT/WTO commitments more generally any measures \u0093necessary to protect human, animal, or plant life or health,\u0094 so long as non-discrimination is upheld and such measures are not merely \u0093disguised restriction[s] on international trade.\u0094 249a pandemic that are almost as high as the noncooperative levels. Finally, consider the rst deviation possibility listed above, namely, the home country deviates from its agreed public health investment level, which it would have to do before the state of the world for the period is determined, and then deviates as well from its agreed export tax regardless of which state of the world obtains in that period. In this case, and continuing to suppose for the moment that the agreement calls for e\u00a2 cient public health investments and export tax levels, the incentive constraint becomes [W(\u0016 N and IBRdenotes the home country\u0092 s opti- mal unilateral \u0093best-response\u0094choice of public health investment given that the foreign country invests the e\u00a2 cient amount I\u0003e.172The inequality in (12.17) is the incentive constraint associated with the home-country choice of I, with an analogous incentive constraint applying to the foreign-country choice of I\u0003. As (12.17) together with (12.5) indicates, whether or not e\u00a2 cient public health in- vestments can be part of a self-enforcing agreement will depend on the elasticity of pandemic risk mitigation with respect to public health investments as re\u0087 ected in\u001a(I;I\u0003)and the properties of the investment cost function c(\u0001), as well as on the magnitude of the discount factor \u000e. Something more interesting can be said, however, once it is recalled that the incentive constraints for \u0016 yand^ ywill also have to be met in any self-enforcing agreement. In particular, suppose that at the most-cooperative export taxes the incentive constraints for \u0016 yand^ yhold with equality. Then, denoting the most- cooperative home-country export taxes as \u0016 c yand^ c y, we not need to introduce separate notation for best-response export taxes in addition to Nash export taxes, because given the absence of import tari\u00a4s and the separability of the xand ysectors the Nash and best-response export taxes are one and the same. 250withIcsatisfying incentive [W(\u0016 s best-response choice of public health invest- ment given that the foreign country invests the amount I\u0003c, andIcis uniquely de ned by (12.19) when this incentive constraint is binding and therefore holds with equality; and \u0016 \u0003c x,^ \u0003c xandI\u0003care similarly de ned for the foreign country. But now recall that defection from Icwill be accompanied by a defection from the cooperative export tax which, by (12.18), would by itself yield a one-time gain equal to\u000e 1\u0000\u000e\u0007cregardless of whether the world ends up in normal times for the period (and therefore the top line of (12.18) applies) or in a pandemic (and therefore the bottom line of (12.18) applies); and hence there can be no additional gain for the home country in deviating from Icif the incentive constraint (12.19) is to hold. In other words, if the agreement achieves the most-cooperative export taxes and leaves no slack in those incentive constraints, then it must implement the non-cooperative Nash levels of public health investment.173 It is intuitive and easy to establish that the optimal (ex-ante world welfare maximizing) agreement in this setting would never allocate all enforcement power to cooperation only on export taxes in the way I have just described.174The upshot is that an optimal self-enforcing agreement that faces constraints on en- forcement power, and that for this reason cannot implement the fully e\u00a2 cient policies, will leave some slack in the export tax incentive constraints in order to allow countries to cooperate at least to some degree on their choices of public health investments. This provides an additional reason why looking to a trade agreement as a forum for blunting the use of export taxes during a pandemic can be counter-productive, and it suggests that the WTO might better allocate its 173This follows from my assumption that policy deviations from the agreement are only ob- served by the other party at the end of the period. 174In fact, in a setting that features terms-of-trade externalities and both trade and behind-the- border policies, Ederington (2001) shows that scarce enforcement power would be allocated rst to non-tari\u00a4 instruments to secure their e\u00a2 cient setting, and only then used to reduce trade taxes toward e\u00a2 cient levels as the incentive constraint allows. The setting I consider here includes as well international (non-pecuniary) externalities through the pandemic probability function \u001a(I;I\u0003)that extend beyond the terms-of-trade externality, so Ederington\u0092 s result does not apply. But it nonetheless points in the same direction, namely, that in a setting with multiple policy instruments that can generate international externalities, an optimal self-enforcing agreement would never allocate all enforcement power to cooperation only on export taxes. 251scarce enforcement power toward helping countries cooperate over measures that could reduce the probability of pandemics in the rst place, perhaps partnering with the WHO in this e\u00a4ort. Notice, too, that the di\u00a2 culties in cooperating over export restraints during a pandemic that I have illustrated here have potentially important rami cations for the organization of supply chains related to the production of vaccines, PPE and other products and materials whose demand is likely to surge during a pandemic. If the incentive to hoard during a pandemic cannot be controlled by interna- tional agreements, countries would be wise to acknowledge this and organize their supply chains accordingly. Put di\u00a4erently, while I have not attempted to model it here, the e\u00a2 cient organization of supply chains for pandemic-related products and materials is itself likely to be impacted in important ways by the enforcement- constraint limitations that governments face when attempting to cooperate over export restraints during a pandemic. 13. A World Trading System for the Twenty-First Century The WTO faces challenges on many fronts. The shallow approach to integra- tion pioneered by GATT seems to have fallen out of favor in recent decades, and the world trading system is increasingly dominated by deep-integration initia- tives with a focus on the trade e\u00a4ects of regulations and other behind-the-border measures and a push toward regulatory convergence. Meanwhile, China\u0092 s entry into the WTO has challenged an approach to globalization that was designed fundamentally with market economies in mind, even while developing economies have long felt that it is the industrialized countries that have mostly gained from GATT/WTO-sponsored market access liberalization. And more recently, within many countries there has been a strong backlash against globalization itself, from those who have not shared in the gains from globalization, and from those who feel that globalization has eroded the sovereignty of their national governments. These challenges have arisen against the backdrop of a dramatic increase in the economic importance of developing and emerging economies, and of changes in the nature of trade brought about by o\u00a4shoring and global value chains and by digitalization and a rise in the importance of trade in services. And beyond these direct challenges, the increasing urgency of addressing climate change has raised questions about the role that the WTO should play in this e\u00a4ort. In light of these developments, do we need a new global trade order for the twenty- rst century? In the preceding chapters I have argued that meeting glob- 252alization\u0092 s challenges in the twenty- rst century will require a nuanced response capable of addressing multilateralism\u0092 s current shortcomings; and to succeed we need a correct diagnosis of those shortcomings. I have argued that for such a diagnosis, it is imperative to understand why GATT worked, the economic envi- ronment it is best suited for, and whether the changes in the economic environment that have occurred in recent decades imply the need for changes in the design of the GATT/WTO, or possibly a new approach to trade agreements altogether, or rather simply better use of the agreements already in place. Why did GATT work? In Part I of this book I have reviewed a body of eco- nomics research that, in a surprisingly wide set of economic environments, consis- tently identi es the central purpose of trade agreements as providing governments with an escape from what amounts formally to a terms-of-trade driven prisoner\u0092 s dilemma. And I have described how this research, which I have referred to col- lectively as the terms-of-trade theory of trade agreements, supports the position that the broad design features of the GATT/WTO appear well-suited to serve this purpose. Hence, in those economic environments for which these ndings apply, the design features of the GATT/WTO can be understood to re\u0087 ect a sound eco- nomic logic; and to the extent that the economic environment of the GATT era did not depart in important ways from those environments, it is GATT\u0092 s design features that can therefore account for its success. On this basis, I have argued for the legitimacy of the GATT/WTO as the constitution of the world trading system for the twentieth century, because it appears well-designed to solve a problem for member governments which, if not the only problem for a trade agreement to solve, was arguably at least the central problem of the GATT era. I have acknowledged that my argument adopts a state- centered view of legitimacy, and that a complete case for the legitimacy of the GATT/WTO would extend to a people-centered perspective as well; but I have maintained that it is the state-centered view of legitimacy that is relevant for the central international task of designing a constitution for the world trading system. From this understanding of GATT\u0092 s success, do the changes in the economic environment that have occurred in recent decades imply the need for changes in the design of the GATT/WTO? I have argued in Part II of this book that the legitimacy of the GATT/WTO can be seen to transcend many of the current challenges that it faces, because those challenges do not stem from changes in the economic environment that would alter the central purpose of a trade agreement from that identi ed by the terms-of-trade theory. This is not to say that meeting those challenges will require no response from the WTO: while in some cases better 253use of the existing GATT/WTO structure may su\u00a2 ce, in other cases reforms of the WTO seem warranted in order to better position the WTO to meet those challenges, reforms that would not necessarily be viewed as minor by the member governments. Still, a key message of the ndings presented in Part II is that to meet those challenges, fundamental departures from the GATT/WTO approach seem unnecessary and are, arguably, unlikely to lead to better outcomes. I have also described in Part II research that raises the possibility that some recent changes in the economic environment may indeed have altered the purpose of trade agreements; and to meet the challenges that arise under these possibilities, more fundamental changes in the approach of the WTO may be required. Gathering these insights together, in this chapter I synthesize and summarize in broad terms what an e\u00a4ective world trading system for the twenty- rst cen- tury might look like. To develop this synthesis, it is useful to begin by putting aside the issues raised by o\u00a4shoring and the push toward regulatory convergence as discussed in chapters 10 and 11, and to focus initially on the challenges de- scribed in the rst three chapters of Part II. These include the set of interrelated challenges for the WTO associated with the rise of the large emerging economies, including China, discussed in chapter 7; the challenges faced by the WTO in ac- commodating e\u00a4orts to address global climate change and the positive role that the WTO might play in addressing this issue, as discussed in Chapter 8; and the implications of digital trade, considering trade in both goods and services, discussed in chapter 9. For each of these challenges, I have suggested that the basic logic of GATT\u0092 s design still applies so that fundamental departures from the GATT/WTO approach are unnecessary. However, to better meet these challenges there are a number of reforms to the WTO suggested by the analysis reviewed above that seem warranted, which I summarize below. To put the logic of these reforms in a broader context, I rst note two cross- cutting themes that emerge from the body of economics research I reviewed in Part I. A rst theme is this: trade agreements that lack deep-integration provisions are not necessarily \u0093weak\u0094agreements; and by the same token, those trade agreements that contain the most developed deep-integration provisions should not necessarily be seen as the \u0093gold standard.\u0094Indeed, in light of the discussion of globalization and national sovereignty in chapter 12, it might be concluded that where the terms-of-trade theory is applicable the opposite may be closer to the truth, as shallow-integration agreements hold out the possibility that countries could reach the international e\u00a2 ciency frontier without sacri cing national sovereignty. More broadly, as I have emphasized in various places throughout the book, at 254a practical level the message of the terms-of-trade theory is not so much that no degree of deep integration is necessary to reach the e\u00a2 ciency frontier, but rather that the market access orientation of the GATT/WTO can provide a potentially useful guardrail to delineate the depth of integration that governments should be willing to contemplate in their agreements in order to reach the e\u00a2 ciency frontier: according to the terms-of-trade theory, there is no reason for a trade agreement to go deeper than what is required to ensure that property rights over negotiated market access are reasonably secure. Such a guardrail can help governments avoid con\u0087 icts between globalization and national sovereignty that, according to the terms-of-trade theory and in particular the discussion in chapter 12, would be unnecessary. Viewed from this perspective, the fact that the GATT/WTO lags behind various regional initiatives to deepen the negotiated commitments of their member governments may be a virtue of the WTO rather than a shortcoming. A better understanding of this may help to serve as a break on the rising dominance of PTAs relative to the WTO in the global trading system. A second cross-cutting theme can also be gleaned from the research I reviewed in Part I. To a rst order, when it comes to trade agreements the primary task of national governments during the GATT era was to dismantle the excessively high trade barriers of the large industrialized countries, and to move the world from a starting point far away from the international e\u00a2 ciency frontier to a position on the frontier; and by the end of the twentieth century much, though not all, of this task had been completed. For the twenty- rst century it could be argued that the primary task for the WTO has shifted, away from helping governments traverse tothe e\u00a2 ciency frontier and toward providing them with the \u0087 exibility they need to remain onthe frontier in the face of various shocks to the world trading system, including the rise of China and the large emerging economies, the digitalization of trade, and the rising threat of climate change; and for this era the capabilities of countries to rebalance and renegotiate their commitments within the GATT/WTO framework is likely to become paramount to the WTO\u0092 s success. In principle the GATT/WTO is as well-equipped for this second task as the GATT proved to be for the rst task, but some WTO reforms may be warranted so that member-governments can exercise these features more e\u00a4ectively. With these cross-cutting themes serving as a backdrop, I now consider what a world trading system for the twenty- rst century might look like, as I said putting aside for the moment the issues raised by o\u00a4shoring and the push toward regulatory convergence. In e\u00a4ect, to meet the remaining challenges that I have described in Part II, there is no need for fundamental changes to the logic of the 255GATT/WTO. But a number of reforms are suggested by the ndings reviewed in those chapters which could help the WTO more e\u00a4ectively meet these challenges, and there are also ways that WTO members might be encouraged to use existing WTO features more e\u00a4ectively in the context of these challenges. For starters, it is clear that the world trading system of the twenty- rst century cannot be e\u00a4ective if it does not nd a way to accommodate China\u0092 s unique economic system. But as I have noted in chapter 7, at issue here is ultimately the task of rebalancing market access commitments, to restore a reciprocal balance between rights and obligations for China and its trading partners: in principle there is no inconsistency between China\u0092 s economic system and the GATT/WTO shallow-integration approach. That is, the challenge for the WTO posed by China is not to nd the capacity to evolve beyond its essential market-access focus in order to successfully accommodate China, nor is it to nd a way to convince China to adopt market reforms. Rather, the challenge for the WTO is to nd a way for China to make additional policy commitments, tailored to compensate for the non-market elements of its economy, that can serve the role of preserving the market access implied by its tari\u00a4 bindings, much as the role that GATT Articles play for market-oriented economies. And I have argued in chapter 7 that the non- violation claim, possibly augmented with some adjustments to usual practices in acknowledgement of the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the challenge for the WTO posed by China, is particularly well-suited to meet this challenge. Once the reciprocal balance between China\u0092 s market access rights and oblig- ations in the WTO has been restored, many of the remaining challenges faced by the world trading system amount to nding ways for countries to reconsider and reorient the levels of their reciprocal market access commitments, possibly through a sequence of renegotiations and negotiations, and possibly facilitated by a number of reforms, all of which might best be orchestrated in the context of a renewed multilateral round of negotiations. As described in chapter 7, for the reconsideration of the level of market access commitments that some industrial- ized countries may desire, GATT Article XXVIII renegotiations in the context of a multilateral round would be relatively straightforward, given the liability- rule structure of the market-access commitments that would be the focus of these renegotiations; and to address the latecomer\u0092 s problem, in principle a sequence of GATT Article XXVIII renegotiations between industrialized countries followed by Article XXVIII bis negotiations between industrialized and developing/emerging countries in a multilateral round could su\u00a2 ce. An important WTO reform that could in principle help countries address the latecomer\u0092 s problem would be to 256revisit the special and di\u00a4erential treatment clause, and to consider formally ter- minating this clause at least as it applies to the market access concessions of the large emerging and developing countries. Similar statements apply to the issues faced by the WTO in accommodating and possibly playing a constructive role in e\u00a4orts to address climate change. As described in chapter 8, the implementation of carbon border adjustments that might accompany a country\u0092 s carbon taxes and that took the form of new MFN tari\u00a4s could be accomplished in the context of GATT Article XXVIII renegotia- tions, and the possibility of reducing these new tari\u00a4s in the context of a multi- lateral round of market access negotiations could be handled in Article XXVIII bis negotiations between industrialized and developing/emerging countries. Here, possible reforms of WTO rules might include provisions that were explicit about the form and function of allowable carbon border adjustments along the lines I have described in chapter 8, to clarify the permissible behavior in anticipation that such adjustments may become commonplace going forward. As I have described in chapter 9, the challenges to the WTO posed by the rise of digital trade may also introduce new reasons for negotiation and renego- tiation of market access commitments. For digital goods trade, the issues are relatively straightforward provided that any non-pecuniary externalities associ- ated with open digital policies are purely local: it may be that as a practical matter the tari\u00a4 commitments negotiated in the pre-digital world no longer a\u00a4ord the same degree of trade protection against imports of that good that they once did; and it may also be that new digital forms of protection become relevant which could undermine existing market access commitments. The rst of these issues could in principle be addressed in the context of Article XXVIII renegotiations, while the second issue could in principle be addressed with the existing WTO rules that are designed to address the erosion of market access commitments with behind-the-border policies more generally. For digital services trade, analogous issues arise, but there are a number of substantial reforms to GATS that I described in chapter 9 that would bring GATS more in line with the shallow approach to integration taken by GATT and that could facilitate further market access negotiations in services. These reforms might be sensible also in the absence of digital trade, but they are made even more attractive by the blurring of the distinction between goods and services that the rise of digital trade is causing. Where non-pecuniary externalities associated with open digital policies cross national borders, the relevant digital policies must be the subject of direct negotia- 257tions by the impacted governments, just as with any non-pecuniary international externality. But as chapter 9 con rms, conditional on these non-pecuniary in- ternational externalities being addressed, achieving the e\u00a2 ciency frontier with GATT\u0092 s shallow approach to integration for all other policies is possible, and so the issues remain as described just above. I now turn to the issues raised by o\u00a4shoring and the push toward regulatory convergence as discussed in chapters 10 and 11. Here, more fundamental changes in the approach of the WTO may be required. Consider rst the issues raised by o\u00a4shoring. As I observed in chapter 10, it is possible that the rise of o\u00a4shoring has introduced into the world trading system a novel form of international policy externality, at least among countries trading specialized inputs along a common global value chain, and in doing so has made the shallow-integration approach of the GATT/WTO no longer well-designed to solve the fundamental trade agreement problem for these countries. If this is so, then deeper forms of integration will be required for these countries to achieve internationally e\u00a2 cient policies, and a stark trade-o\u00a4 between sovereignty and globalization may be unavoidable.175But as I noted there, it is also possible that the rise of o\u00a4shoring has notchanged the nature of the international policy externality, because to date the available evidence on this point is only indirect and suggestive, and there is no empirical evidence on the crucial question, namely, whether the recent rise in o\u00a4shoring has changed the nature of the dominant form of international price determination. In light of these unknowns and until there is more direct empirical evidence on the nature of the changes wrought by the rise of o\u00a4shoring, a conservative approach to advocating changes in the world trading system in response to o\u00a4shoring seems appropriate, an approach that builds on the GATT/WTO foundation and so con- tinues to be well-suited for addressing traditional international policy externalities while responding to those issues that are introduced by o\u00a4shoring with bespoke arrangements as warranted. A reasonable approach might be to embrace plurilat- eral agreements within the WTO framework (provided for in WTO Article II.3) as a safety valve for achieving deeper integration among countries that strongly desire to pursue such agreements. The bene ts of plurilateral agreements for this 175Here I am again using sovereignty in the informal sense that I have used it everywhere in the book except for chapter 12. An open question is whether e\u00a2 ciency could be reached in the o\u00a4shoring models of Antras and Staiger (2012a, b) or the version of their model that I have developed in chapter 10 without violating a country\u0092 s sovereignty as that notion is formalized in Bagwell and Staiger (2018) and described in chapter 12. 258purpose \u0096as opposed to preferential trade agreements of the kind allowed under GATT Article XXIV and currently the vehicle of choice \u0096 have been discussed in the literature (see, for example, Hoekman and Mavroidis, 2015, and Hoekman and Sabel, 2020), and they are likely to provide a route toward deeper integration for willing countries that is less disruptive to the fundamental principles of the GATT/WTO than other routes. A potential impediment to this approach is that the WTO requires plurilateral agreements to be approved by a consensus of WTO members, including those who do not intend to joint the plurilateral. This raises the possibility that some countries who have no intention of joining the plurilateral and have no direct interest in it might nevertheless hold up its approval to gain leverage in other unrelated negotiations, and a possible reform of the WTO might involve relaxing in some way the consensus requirement for the formation of plurilateral agreements in the WTO (see Hoekman and Mavroidis, 2015, for the outlines of one such proposal). But even without this reform, relying on plurilaterals that can achieve consensus to serve as an outlet for the desires of countries that wish to pursue deeper integration agreements may be an attractive option for the world trading system as a response to o\u00a4shoring, given that the conservative approach that I have argued for in this case would indicate that erring on the side of caution and adopting a criterion for such agreements that is too stringent is arguably better than adopting a criterion for such agreements that is too permissive. With regard to the question of regulatory convergence discussed in chapter 11, as I noted there it is useful to distinguish cases where product standards have a clear role in addressing an important consumption externality from cases where the existence of such consumption externalities cannot be established. In the former case, and even when the externality does not cross national borders, direct negotiations over the ne details of the relevant product standards will be warranted, but only if in addition preferences for the products are heterogeneous across countries and rms face higher costs when they tailor their product at- tributes to local tastes. The fact that these are relatively special circumstances suggests that, in the former case and where such circumstances arise, countries could address the issue with deep integration initiatives that involve negotiating selectively over the relevant standards, possibly with plurilaterals again serving as the most attractive vehicle for accommodating these commitments. For all other circumstances a shallow approach to integration with regard to product standards would su\u00a2 ce. Here, some combination of national treatment, other elaborations on non-discrimination rules, and the non-violation clause, com- 259bined in some circumstances (i.e., where preferences for the products are heteroge- neous across countries and rms face higher costs when they tailor their product attributes to local tastes) with a rebuttable presumption of mutual recognition, would in principle allow countries to achieve e\u00a2 cient policies for standards that were not directly negotiated. The introduction of mutual recognition, even in limited circumstances, would be novel in the context of the WTO, and is a reform worth considering according to the ndings I have reviewed in chapter 11. Finally, looming over all of this is the possibility that neither the rise in o\u00a4- shoring nor the conditions that have led to the turn toward regulatory convergence are in fact a root cause of concern for the WTO; and that instead, for the reasons discussed in chapter 12, without U.S. leadership the rules-based multilateral trad- ing system is simply heading into a period of decline and, as Kagan (2018) put it, \u0093returning the world to its natural state \u0096a dark jungle of competing interests, clashing nationalism, tribalism and self-interest.\u0094But even if this apocalyptic di- agnosis does capture the main cause of the rules-based trading system\u0092 s ills, there is great value in attempting to support, preserve and improve the existing global trade order until such time as a new hegemon arrives and the rules-based system can again thrive. As I have described in previous chapters, the fundamental de- sign of the rules-based multilateral trading system has proven e\u00a4ective in solving an important and, by this diagnosis, still-central problem, and it should not be allowed to wither away. By this diagnosis the shallow-integration approach of the GATT/WTO is well-designed to solve the fundamental trade agreement problem: as such, a stark trade-o\u00a4 between sovereignty and globalization may be avoidable, but only if the WTO is supported and its approach strengthened. Could China be the next hegemon that the WTO is looking for? Currently to many this may seem unlikely, but along the lines sketched out in chapter 12, as its dominance grows China may see it in its interest to more fully commit to making these rules work; and until that time, even according to this apocalyptic diagnosis, the WTO deserves broad support as the legitimate constitution of the global trade order. 14. Conclusion In this book I have argued that the best hope for creating an e\u00a4ective world trading system for the twenty- rst century is to build on the foundations of the world trading system of the twentieth century. I have constructed this argument in two steps, rst, by developing an understanding of why GATT worked and the economic environment it is best suited for, and second, by evaluating according 260to this understanding whether the changes in the economic environment that have occurred in recent decades imply the need for changes in the design of the GATT/WTO. I have argued that the terms-of-trade theory of trade agreements provides a compelling framework for understanding the success of GATT in the twentieth century, and I have argued that according to this understanding the logic of GATT\u0092 s design features transcend many, though not all, of the current challenges faced by the WTO. It is from this perspective that one could say, as I wrote in the Introduction, that the best advice for designing a world trading system for the twenty- rst century may not be \u0093Move fast and break things,\u0094 but rather Keep Calm and Carry On. With this advice I am not claiming that reforms to the world trading system are not needed, or that all is well at the WTO. But I am claiming that the architecture of the GATT/WTO \u0096and of the GATT, in particular \u0096is well-suited to guide the design of the world trading system of the twenty- rst century. Even if the logic of my argument is accepted, there is still the question: How could the designers of GATT have gotten it so right? Two observations can help to answer this question. First, as I described in chapter 2, the designers of GATT did not build GATT from scratch. Rather, GATT was modeled on the US Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, whose design in turn bene ted from decades of experimentation with various trade agreement designs both in the United States and Europe. So the designers of GATT were very much standing on the shoulders of those before them, and were bene ciaries of a trial-and-error learning process that had been going on for decades. A second observation may also help explain how the designers of GATT could have gotten it so right. GATT was born in the aftermath of World War II when the world economy was in a period of deep crisis, and some of the best economic minds of the day, including James Meade and John Maynard Keynes, were recruited to help in its design. Meade was a member of the British delegation to the London and Geneva conferences in 1946 and1947 which produced the charter for the International Trade Organization and GATT, and along with Keynes, Meade was widely regarded as a central gure in these conferences (see for example Penrose, 1953, pp. 89-90). And so economics clearly held a position of prominence in shaping the design decisions that led to GATT, arguably far more than would have been the case if GATT had been designed under less exceptional circumstances.176 176It has long been observed that periods of crisis can create favorable conditions for the creation of institutions to solve otherwise intractable problems. See, for example, Langan- Riekhof, Avanni and Janetti (2017). 261Of course, this begs the question of whether these economists emphasized the terms-of-trade externality associated with commercial policy that lies at the heart of the terms-of-trade theory of trade agreements; and, if they did, whether they viewed GATT as a forum for addressing these terms-of-trade externalities. But as Bagwell and Staiger (2016) have observed, the Haberler Report , commissioned by GATT and written by a Panel of Experts composed of Roberto de Oliveira Cam- pos, Gottfried Haberler, James Meade and Jan Tinbergen, suggests an a\u00a2 rmative answer to this question. Writing on the topic of commercial policy in the 1950\u0092 s and the agricultural protectionism of industrialized countries during that period, the Haberler Report does indeed emphasize terms-of-trade externalities, expressed in a multi-country setting along the lines that I have sketched in chapter 4: The problem of the interests of di\u00a4erent primary producing countries outside industrialized Western Europe and North America is ... not only a question which of the other countries would gain by a moderation of agricultural protectionism in these two great industrialized regions; there are undoubtedly cases in which an increase in agricultural protectionism in these two regions, while it would be to the disadvantage of some of the unindustrialized countries, would actually be to the advantage of others. ... An increased stimulus to the production of wheat in any of the countries of North America or of Western Europe by increasing the exportable surplus of North America and decreasing the import requirements of Western Europe would depress the world market for wheat. This might mean that a country like India or Japan would obtain cheaper imports of wheat (either because of a fall in the world price or because of a development of special sales or gifts for the disposal of surplus wheat by the United States), but a country like Australia or the Argentine which competed in the world export market for wheat would be damaged. ... In general, if one considers any particular agricultural product, a pro- tective stimulus to its production in any one country by increasing supplies relatively to the demand for that product will tend to depress the world market for that product. This will damage the interests of other countries which are exporters of the product on the world market. But it will be to the national interest of countries which import the product from world markets. Whether the initial protective stimulus confers a net bene t or a net damage to all other countries concerned depends, therefore, upon whether the country giving the protective stimulus to its own production is 262an exporter or an importer of the product; if it is an exporter it is conferring a bene t on the world by giving its supplies away at a cheap price; if it is an importer it is damaging the rest of the world by refusing to take their supplies. This general principle can be applied to a single country or to a whole region. It is because Western Europe and North America in combination are netimporters of agricultural produce that we reach the general conclusion that a reduction of agricultural protectionism in these areas will on balance bene t the rest of the world...(GATT, 1958, pp 93-94, original emphasis, footnotes omitted). Here, when describing the impacts of agricultural protectionism in the industrial- ized world on various countries in the rest of the world, the Report\u0092 s references to \u0093depress the world market,\u0094 \u0093fall in the world price,\u0094 gains for other importing countries from \u0093cheaper imports\u0094and losses for countries which \u0093competed in the world export market\u0094re\u0087 ect a simple terms-of-trade logic. Moreover, the Harberler Report\u0092 s references to the protective policies of \u0093any of the countries of North America or of Western Europe,\u0094 \u0093any one country\u0094 and \u0093a single country\u0094 suggest that the Report\u0092 s authors accepted the notion that a single country\u0092 s protective choices could have world price impacts; indeed, the general principle for signing the international externalities associated with commercial policy intervention stated by the Report in the quoted passage above is couched in terms of \u0093the country giving the protective stimulus.\u0094Hence, in these paragraphs the authors appear to be describing the terms-of-trade externality that is at the heart of the terms-of-trade theory of trade agreements. And it also appears that the authors of the Haberler Report viewed GATT as a forum for addressing these terms-of-trade commercial policy externalities, as the Report makes recommendations that are based on these terms-of-trade externality patterns. For example, the following recommendation, taken from the Report\u0092 s executive summary, re\u0087 ects the application of the international externality signing principle as articulated in the quoted excerpt above: Since in North America and Western Europe as a whole net imports of agricultural products represent the relatively narrow margin by which their large domestic consumption exceeds their large, but not quite so large, domestic production, a relatively small restraint on domestic production or stimulus to domestic consumption could lead to a large percentage increase in their net imports. For this reason much could be achieved by some 263moderate change in the direction of the agricultural policies of the highly industrialized countries. (GATT, 1958, p. 9). It is therefore accurate to say that the GATT was forged with the bene t of a substantial amount of knowledge, accumulated through prior experience, about what worked and what did not work, and at a moment in history where the best economists of the day were able to exert a remarkable level of in\u0087 uence over its design. This unique set of circumstances may go a long way toward explaining how the designers of GATT got it so right. More speculatively, this may also help to account for the fact that, with the creation of the WTO, a number of features were added to the basic architecture of GATT that are less clearly supported by economic arguments.177The Uruguay Round negotiations that gave birth to the WTO in 1995 did not correspond to a period of crisis for the world economy in the way that GATT\u0092 s creation in 1947did, and it is perhaps in part for this reason that industry lobbies appear to have had a much bigger role in driving the design of the WTO than was true of GATT.178 Whether or not the world economy is entering a crisis phase akin to that which gave rise to GATT, there is reason to hope that, with an economist now at the helm of the WTO, economics may again be elevated to a position of prominence in the design decisions for the world trading system of the twenty- rst century. 177For example, Sykes (2003) o\u00a4ers a critique of the design and legal interpretations of the elaborations on GATT Article XIX embodied in the WTO Safeguard Agreement, Bagwell and Staiger (2006) have argued that the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures may have marked a step backward relative to GATT\u0092 s treatment of subsidies (see also Sykes, 2005), and a number of economists have questioned the wisdom of including TRIPS in the WTO and its particular design (see, for example, Deardor\u00a4, 1990). 178See, for example, the account in Gad (2003) of the in\u0087 uence of the pharmaceutical lobbies on the TRIPS negotiations, among others. 264References [1] Aaronson, Susan A. 2018. \u0093What are we talking about when we talk about digital protectionism?\u0094 World Trade Importance of Regulatory Coop- eration in an Era of Digital Trade.\u0094 World Trade Review 18(S1): s99-s120.
