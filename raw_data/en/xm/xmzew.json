In this report, we describe the results of four different analys es performed as part of the MAPPING_NCD project activities on diabetes: mapping of major past and current research programmes in the field, mapping of private sector investments in diabetes research, interviews with stakeholders' and bibliometric analys is. The analysis of European research projects has highlighted areas of research where action has been taken to foster knowledge creation and sharing through funding of relevant projects. Diabetes Type I and Type II as classified by ICD -10 are a major fo cus of funding, which is mirrored by the result s of the bibliometric analysis. Cardiovascular complications are most commonly studied in the projects funded by the European programmes, as well as other national and international RFOs. It emerges that maj or projects tend to focus less on the study of patient- disease management, as well as on the analysis of policies related to diabetes prevention and treatment. A particularly crucial issue in this respect concerns the promotion of effective engagement with the general public to raise awareness on prevention of type II diabetes . Another area where investments are needed is the study of systems to share biological samples through bio -banks, registry data and research findings across Europe . Over the period 2011 -2014, the European pharmaceutical sector has generally increased its R&D expenditures, however with few exceptions. The most substantial increase was registered by smaller pharmaceutical companies. In terms of R&D intensity (a measur e that allows to capture the relative importance of R&D among firms in the same industry), current findings suggest that US pharmaceutical companies generally allocate more resources in research and development activities than EU firms. However, when focu sing specifically on research pipelines for diabetes, US companies loose their role of leaders, with 26 molecules under development compared to 40 for EU firms. These are mainly aimed at treating type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, with a minority dedica ted to diabetes complications. Over the period 2011 -2014, the medical device sector commitment to R&D investments has been highly heterogeneous . As regards R&D intensity, US firms generally record higher levels of R&D ratio on sales than EU companies, me aning that US medical devices companies allocate more resources in research and development activities than EU firms. Diabetes medical devices cons ist of a wide range of products: from insulin pumps to blood glucose meters and infusion sets. Despite bein g one of the top 10 causes of disability worldwide , few companies in the sector have developed any diabetes relevant medical devices in recent years. The themes emerged from the stakeholders interviews were organized in six major areas: i) challenges in diabetes research, ii) duplication in diabetes research, iii) research gaps, iv) impact of research and priority -setting, v) partnerships and vi) the role of the EU. According to the informants, the challenges faced by researchers and RFOs in diabetes res earch are financial and organizational. Heterogeneity of funding bodies was perceived to be an opportunity to preserve and develop through structured forms of cooperation. A general broader view on the impact of research as impact on diagnostic and thera peutic practice, patient outcomes and health services was supported. In terms of research gaps or unmet need, informants pointed out the broad area of aetiology (i.e. pathogenesis of hypo/hyperglycaemic events, pathogenesis of chronic complications), prev ention Critical Appraisal Report DIAB - UB 10 (i.e. genetic factors linked to the adult development of T2DM) or treatment (i.e. adjunct therapies, artificial pancreas, beta- cell transplantation, cell line conversion). Many of these topics were also emerging through the bibliometric and researc h programs analysis. Similarly, bio-banks development was the most recommended suggestion to speed up genetic -based studies. Another probably unexpected topic suggested for future research was on the social and health related quality of life aspects of p eople living with the disease, how it is possible to make patients and families more engaged with the treatment and how to get them to use the treatment much more effectively . Finally, and in addition to what can be captured through other methodologies, t he role attributed to the EU is one of coordination and leadership, with recommendations on fruitful engagement in discussion with all stakeholders or wider net cast to involve experts in drafting programs calls. The Bibliometric analysis provides a quant itative methodology to assess the impact of research funding in the fi eld of diabetes in terms of production of scientific publications, as well as level of influence via citation analysis . It has allowed the identification of specific peculiarities related to volume, geography and type of funding institutions . Overall, the volume of diabetes research as a proportion of biomedical scientific production has increased over the years, with geographic heterogeneity across countries in terms of GDP - produ ctivity link. When looking at the burden of disease, countries such as the UK publish more than what prevalence and DALYs of the disease would suggest. There is a tendency for the N orthern European count ries to devote relatively more attention to Type I diabetes, while the contrary holds true for Southern Europe. Type II diabetes papers are much more numerous and 66% more cited, on average , than Type I diabetes papers . Scandinavian countries display higher number of funders per paper and more private -non-profit sources, especially endowed foundations. For most countries the percentage of internationally - funded papers is quite low and mainly refers to funding from the EU. The European Union is the largest single source of support in terms of the numbers of papers funded, with the second largest being the Danish company Novo Nordisk A/S. There are numerous discussion points that start to surface by the combined considerations of findings from different analyse s in this report. In the next and final evidence synthesis deliverable, we will illustrate the triangulation of the various outputs from the MAPPING_NCD project within each disease categories to contrast, reinforce or discuss emerging directives to guide the futur e research funding strategies across NCD s around Europe. Critical Appraisal Report DIAB - UB 11 1 European Research Programs This section presents an overview of European research programs funded to study d iabetes and enhance the understanding of the disease . The previous \"Impact Assessment\" deliverable has extensively documented how crucial advancement in this area is needed . Diabetes has, in fact, reached epidemic proportions in the European Union: in 2012, around 32 million people in the EU were living with diabetes. This prevalence translates into considerable expenses for States, as on average 10% of their healthcare resources are devoted to treatment of this pathology and its complications (Nabais , 2013). While new therapies and approaches have improved the prognosis and quality of life for patients affected by diabetes, there is still no complete cure for diabetes and morbidity/increased mortality still represent a challenge: this calls for the need of better research funding strategies, as well as increased funding amounts made availab le to researchers (Halban & Hills, 2010) . Analyzing the current status quo in terms of type and focus of program funded represents a major step in the development of future funding and promotion strategies at European level in the field of diabetes. For this purposes both national -level and European -level RFOs and their funded projects should be considered in order to highlight relevant work conducted at all governance levels within the European context. Critical Appraisal Report DIAB - UB 12 1.1 Methods 1.1.1 Inclusion criteria We ackno wledge the challenges in attempting to provide a comprehensive list of all projects funded in this area across EU31. This work builds upon the findings of the survey on RFOs in Europe conducted and presented in the previous deliverables. Therefore RFOs c onsidered represent only a sample of the actual landscape of organizations that are funding research on diabetes across Europe. For what concerns the objectives of Work Package 4, in the previous work we have mapped two categories of RFOs: those funding research on a range of diseases, including diabetes, and those funding exclusively projects on diabetes. In this section we consider only the latter institutions, as their \"narrower\" focus on diabetes allows to study their funding strategies on the disease of interest, partially eliminating the potential influence or spillovers from funding strategies for other disease areas . For instance, a RFO supporting projects both in diabetes and cardiovascular pathologies may be drawn to consider more extensively th e issue of cardiovascular complications of diabetes rather than other research areas. Therefore information on specific projects funded was retrieved for those diabetes -specific RFOs identified during the previous survey -phase of the project. As reported in the Impact Assessment report, these RFOs are located in France (n= 5), The Netherlands (n=2), Portugal (n=1), United Kingdom (n= 3), Ireland (n=1), Norway (n=1) or operate at international level (n=1) (Table 1). Table 1 RFOs funding exclusively research in the field of diabetes France Association Fran\u00e7aise des Diab\u00e9tiques Association pour la Recherche sur le renales Fondation Orange The Netherlands Dutch Diabetes Research Foundation Diabetes Fonds Portugal Association of diabetics of Portugal / Associacao protectora dos diabeticos de Portugal United Kingdom Diabetes UK The Diabetes Research & Wellness Foundation Independent Diabetes Trust Critical Appraisal Report DIAB - UB 13 Ireland Diabetes Ireland Research Alliance (+HRB/MRCG) Norway Norwegian Diabetes Association International Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Given that the European Union is a major active funder of health res earch, particularly through its framework programmes , a list of projects funded by the European Commission under EU FP -6 and FP-7 relevant to diabetes research was retrieved . Also the list of H2020 projects was consulted. The general criteria for inclusion of projects were: i) timeframe 2006 -13 to include projects under FP-6 and FP -71; ii) projects funded by diabetes -specific RFOs identified during the previous phase of the MAPPING _NCD project, that is RFOs that responded to the survey or for which funding data was available ; iii) projects in the diabetes -related categories (e. g. Type I and type2) as classified by the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision2. The resulting lists of projects are reported in Appendix 1,2 and 3. 1.1.2 Search of relevant projects Research on specific projects funded by the identified list of RFOs was conducted on institutional websites and websites of national associations on diabetes. Out of 14 diabetes -specific RFOs, detailed information on type of projects funded was found for 6 RFOs. Table 2 provides a summary of the organizations and of projects funded (full list in Annex 1). The list may not be exhaustive, given that not all RFOs report information on currently or recently fun ded projects. Table 2 Diabetes -specific RFOs, projects funded RFO name Projects funded Diabetes UK 82 projects Dutch Diabetes Research Foundation 33 current projects, 103 completed projects The Diabetes Research & Wellness Foundation 88 projects, of which 41 in the period 2006 -2013 1 To feed the discussion on future research trends a list of H2020 pr ojects is also reported. 2 Research investment in diabetes was defined as \" research into causation, occurrence, preventi on, diagnosis, pathophysiology and treatment of diabetes mellitus and its long -term consequences \". Four the purposes of this work two major ICD -10 categories for diabetes, namely Type I diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) , are identified. Critical Appraisal Report DIAB - UB 14 Diabetes Ireland Research Alliance 7 projects from 2009 to 2014 Juvenile Diabetes Research Fund 313 in major EU countries Association Fran\u00e7aise des Diab\u00e9ti ques 16 projects from 2010 to 2013 The list of projects funded by the European Commission under the Framework P rogrammes Sixth and Seventh (and Horizon 2020) was drawn from a key word search on the CORDIS (Community Research and Development Information Service) platform . To retrieve EC -funded projects we originally conducted a search in the CORDIS database using a search string comprising the keywords \"diabetes mellitus\" ( given the relevant ICDs identified , see footnote in previous page ) produced 117 results, of which 64 be longing to the relevant time period. We noticed however that some big research projects ( e.g. MAPPING _NCD itself) were left out so we conducted the same research using the more general keyword \"diabetes\", with a filter for FP7 and FP6 programmes. The resu lts show 446 projects relevant to the time period 2006 -2013. Of these, 327 were FP7 projects, while 119 were funded through the FP6 program. A further selection was carrie d out, searching the 446 by key words in the fields \"title\" or \"content\" (\"diabetes\" , \"diabetic\", \"insulin\") to single out projects specifically related to diabetes (rather than for instance chronic diseases in general): 139 projects were selected of which 36 F6 and 103 FP7 (Annex 2). A search conducted in the database for Horizon 20203, using t he same key words found 52 relevant projects (Annex 3). 1.1.3 Definition of a purposive sample From the lists of projects reported above (cfr. Annex 1,2,3), a set of particularly relevant project is presented in the tables below, organized by ICD . Projects were selected on the basis of total funding received (>1 million Euros), where such selection was possible . This serves the purpose of identifying the key areas where RFOs have been willing to invest large amounts of money . With the exception of EC programs, RFOs did not report funding amounts by project (at least not in an organized and searchable fashion), therefore such projects could not be classified in the tables below; their content however is presented in a descriptive manner in the following paragraphs. Horizon 2020 projects were also considered to show current or foreseeable future relevant research conducted in the field.

Fewer proje cts relate to patient or disease management. Four projects aim at improving prevention strategies for Type II diabetes and, unsurprisingly, no projects among those presented in Table 3 and Table 4 target the issue of prevention of Type I diabetes. However, the development of novel prevention strategies for Type I diabetes wa s identified as a priority of research in diabetes (DIAMAP project , 2010) . The considerable improvement in understanding the genetic basis of this pathology needs to be complemented with a more advanced understanding of the environmental factors that play a key role in the rise of the disease. The rapid increase in the incidence of Type I diabetes in genetically stable populations implies an important role for environmental factors (Knip , 2005) . Some national RFOs have funded narrower projects in this field . For instance, the Dutch Diabetes Research Foundation has funded a study on \" Prevention and treatment of ketoacidosis in Type I diabetes via the inhibition of hepatic beta -oxydation\" (see Annex 1) . The Juvenile Diabetes Research Fund promoted a project on Type I prevention by induction of dermal tolerogenic dendritic cells and another study on Prevention of Type I diabetes by Treg vaccination with an insulin mimetope. Preventive effo rts on Type II diabetes currently tend to focus on high -risk patients. An example is the EU (FP7) project RCN 101811 (2012- 2015), led by the Steno Diabetes Center, which aims at identifying novel diagnostic and predictive biomarkers (i) to detect the pro gression toward diabetes in high - risk individuals and (ii) that are responsive to lifestyle interventions known to be effective in diabetes prevention. The project has a strong translational focus, by setting the main intervention in the real- life contex t of a major health insurance system. While individual approaches in specific sub - groups are effective , future research should aim at tackling the problem at population -level (DIAMAP project , 2010; Rosella, 2011). Another area that should be further expanded is the study of preventive and treatment measures for complications , given the impact of complications (such as vascular complications) on the social and economic burden for patients and society (Van Dieren , 2010) . Randomised controll ed trials testing therapies for people with Type II diabetes have demonstrated that many of the complications of diabetes are preventable (DIAMAP project 2010) . Most recent research focuses on the role of diabetes in determining micro - and macrovascular d isease (examples of these studies are funded by the Dutch Diabetes Research Foundation, the Association Fran\u00e7aise des Diab\u00e9tiques and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Fund) while its role in other health outcomes (such as cancer or cognitive function) is les s studied. Diabetes UK has for instance funded a \u00a382,700 PhD Studentship on renal and vision complications in diabetes. Biomarkers that help predicting individual risk to develop Type II diabetes are also under study. Among the organizations promoting this research topic are, for instance, the Dutch Diabetes Research Foundation6, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Fund7, and The Diabetes Research & Wellness 6 With projects such as \" Biomarkers for the Prediction and Early Diagnosis of Diabetes and Diabetes -related Cardiovascular Complications (PREDICCt) \" 7 With projects such as \"Developing and optimizing pHLA multimers as a biomarker for T1D Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 28 Foundation8. Also the European Commission has funded projects aimed at identifying novel diagnostic and predictive biomarkers (eg. EU FP7 project DEXLIFE on diabetes Type II ). However, to this end there is still need to address the general lack of bio -banks of accessible human tissues and samples, which are of paramount importance for researc h (Bueno de Mesquita , 2015) . This has also been observed by stakeholders during the interviews (see section 3). Bio-banks also provide opportunities to include geographical and environmental information in diabetes research (Bellazzi, 2013). This would for instance enhance t he development of lifestyle intervention strategies to prevent Type II diabetes and obesity based on specific genetic traits to enhance efficacy of this approaches . A better integration of activities and collaboration between European in stitutions is needed in this regard , with the academia and the industry, particularly the food & beverage sector, not only in terms of research funding but also in terms of policy/regulatory actions. As expressed by dr. Andrew JM Boulton, President of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes , this means for instance more attention to advertising of fast foods and sponsorship of sports events (Collins, 2014 ). A considerable bulk of r esearch has been focusing on the study of treatment for diabetes . One issue of consideration has been the development of a better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying beta cell function, survival and regeneration, and how they are impacted by the fundamental disease process. Several EU funded projects in the period considered are focusing on topic as well as projects promoted by RFOs in different coun tries (eg . Diabetes UK, Dutch Diabetes Research Foundation, The Diabetes Research & Wellness Foundation and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Fund ). A major challenge in this area is the comprehension of tissue -to-tissue communication in diabetes pathogenesis, particularly expanding knowledge beyond the classical tissues currently recognized as relevant in glucose -control (DIAMAP project , 2010) . Both the EU and national -level RFOs have funded several studies addressing the control of energy balance and weight regulation, with an essential focus on the translation into therapy to benefit the person with diabetes. For instance, the Horizon2020 prog ram has funded a project on the delineation of a brain circuit regulating energy expenditure to impact body weight (RCN 195912 ). When comparing current funded projects to strategies set in the past ( EUDWG , 2010), some areas of research seem to have been mo re explored, while for what concerns other crucial issues there is still need for improvement both in research advancement and in coordination among stakeholders. For instance , it still emerges the need for better coordination of research and access to bi ological samples, registry data and research findings across Europe to avoid duplication and enh ance effective use of funding. Commun ication also remains a critical issue with respect both to better dissemination strategies of advancements in research and effective engagement with diabetic patients and public opinion in activities aimed at raising awareness. Many of these themes emerging from the analysis of past and current research projects are common with the results of the informants interview data analysis presented in Section 3. Juvenile Diabetes R esearch Fund\", \" : Validation of Novel and Candidate Biomarkers for Diabetic Kidney Disease in Large Cohorts of people with Type I Diabetes \", \"Biomarkers of heterogeneity: an integrated approach to clinical and metabolic phenotyping of individuals with esta blished Type I diabetes \" 8 With projects such as \" To use Mendelian randomisation to understanding the causal relationship between circulating biomarkers and Type II Diabetes in the UK Bio -bank\" . Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 29 2 Private Sector Investment in Diabetes According to the Global Diabetes Plan 2011 -2021, 4.6 million deaths annually are attributable to diabetes, which ranks in the top 10 causes of disability worldwide. After the UN High- Level Summit on Non -communicable Diseases (NCDs) in 2011, diabetes, together with the other NCDs, registered an increase in importance in the health agenda (IDF, 2011) . Consequently, policy makers started to become more aware of the fact that investing in diabetes prevention and care can improve the quality of life of people affected, hinder diabetes -related complications and save lives. Investments in NCDs research funding originate from a variety of sources: national governments, regional organizations, charities, non -governmental organizations and supranational organizations. In this section, we provide a comprehensive overview of private sector investment in NCD s research, considering both Pharmaceutical and Medical Device sectors, with a p articular focus on diabetes R&D investment. 2.1.1 Background: Private Sector Investment in Research and Development R&D investment is the milestone for the creation of new products and services that stimulate growth, improve welfare and create a knowledge -driven economy. According to the \"Europe 2020 indicators - research and developmen t\", the financial crisis of 2008 -2009 and its negative impact on GDP growth, accompanied by an increase in government spending on R&D, led to an increase in R&D intensity (i.e. R&D expenditure as a percentage of GDP ) in most EU Member States. In order to hinder economic crisis, in fact, some EU countries, supported by the European Commission, increased public R&D expenditure to boost economic growth and encoura ge private R&D investment, which constitutes the largest source of R&D expenditurein Europe (63.8% of total R&D investments in 2013) (Eurostat, s.d.). Figure 3 shows R&D intensity by EU country for the years 2008 and 2013. It is possible to observe that, despite the crisis, most European states experienced an increase in R&D commitment between 2008 and 2013. Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 30 Figure 3 Proportion of GDP dedicated to R&D by EU country, 2008 and 2013 Source: Europe 2020 indicators - research and development Despite the increased efforts of some EU Members States, the EU is still lagging behind other jurisdictions such as the United States, Japan and South Korea in terms of private sector R&D investments, as outlined in Figure 4. In fact, while only 62 % of EU R&D intensity originated from the business enterprise sector in 2010, the United States, China, South Korea an d Japan registered between 68.5% and 76.6 % of R&D intensity from this sector (Eurostat, s.d.). Figure 4 International comparison of R&D intensity, 2002 -2013 Source: Europe 2020 indicators - research and development Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 31 The \"2014 EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard\" (the Scoreboard), published by the European Commission, provides economic and financial data of the world's top 2500 private companies for R&D expenditures, which account for 90% of the world's industrial investment in research and development. The sample contains 633 EU based companies and 1867 companies located elsewhere. Across the various sectors of industry, these top 2500 R&D private investors recorded a quick rebound in sales and R&D investments after the financial crisis of 2009 ( Figure 5). Sales and R&D expenditures have been continuously growing in the following years, although at a lower rate, and in 2013 private companies' increase in R&D commitment (+4.9% on average) was higher than the growth of net sales (+2.8%). However, the EU companies of the sample showed an annual R&D investment growth rate of 2.6%, substantially below the world average. Figure 5 R&D investment and net sales growth, 2006 -2013 Source: The 2014 EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard, European Commission, JRC/DG RTD. Figure 6 displays R&D trends among the 2014 top R&D investors aggregated by industrial sectors, showing the relative R&D share by main world region. The Pharmaceuticals & Biotechnology sector include s companies specialized on pharmaceuticals, medical devices, chemistry and biotechnologies. This sector occupies the first position in the R&D ranking, and its share of total R&D investment amounts to 18%. It is interesting to underline that the growing R&D expenditure is driven especially by biotechnology industry, which registered an increase of 22.3% in research investments, while traditional pharmaceutical companies decreased R&D expenditures by 1.8% with respect to 2012 (European Commission, 2014b). The Figure also shows that the leading world region in Pharmaceuticals & Biotechnology R&D investments are the USA, immediately followed by Europe. As regards the Pharmaceuticals sub -sector, the EU and the US have similar amounts of R&D investment and in tensity, while in the Biotechnology sub -sector the US dominates the EU in number of companies (5 times more numerous), R&D investment (10 times larger) and larger average R&D intensity per company (European Commission, 2014b). Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 32 Figure 6 R&D ranking of industrial sector and share of main world regions in 2013 Source: The 2014 EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard, European Commission, JRC/DG RTD. Although R&D investment in the pharmaceutical industry has increased substantially in absolute terms, R&D productivity has dropped as witnessed by the lack of a corresponding increase in the number of new drugs being approved , mainly due to the increased costs associated with the development of new medicines (European Commission, 2014a) . The average R&D cost per new chemical entity brought to the market is estimated to be $2,558 million9, and this high cost is imputable to three reasons (Danzon et al; 2003): high input costs for both drug discovery and drug de velopment; the time value of money : it takes 12 -15 years to advance a drug from discovery through regulatory approval; high failure rates : it is estimated that only 1 out of 5000 compounds screened becomes an approved drug, and the cost of \"dry holes\" (i .e. compounds that fail ) is included in the average cost per approved molecular entity. In this context of declining R&D productivity but increasing total expenditures , it becomes important to investigate private sector R&D commitment in NCD research funding in order to provide an accurate analysis of how the business world is currently dealing with R&D challenge in the five therapeutic areas that are of interest for the MAPPING NCD project. 9 http://csdd.tufts.edu/files/uploads/Tufts_CSDD_briefing_on_RD_cost_study_ -_Nov_18,_2014..pdf Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 33 2.1.2 Mapping the Private Sector Research P ipeline As anticipated above, t he main objective of this section is to map out private sector R&D investmen t in d iabetes, considering both Pharmaceutical and Medical Device industries. Mapping R&D expenditures allows to quantify R&D composition and size across NCDs, providing a deeper understanding of where the research is mainly directed for each NCD and which are instead the underfunded areas. Both European and US based companies are considered in the sample of R&D investors; this comparison could show potential discrepancies in terms of R&D commitment between industries of the two world regions. In order to map Pharmaceutical sector's R&D expenditures in d iabetes, we considered the top European and US pharmaceutical companies in terms of R&D investment in 201410. Financial data of each company were collected from freely available annual reports for the period 2011 -2014 . Figure 7 shows the top 2 0 phar maceutical companies based in the US and Europe by investment in R&D. On top of industry's research investment in diabetes research , in the following paragraphs we also describe the research pipeline for the top pharmaceutical companies in terms of Molecu les in Phase I, Phase II, Phase III, Submission and Approval.

It is estimat ed that 347 million people worldwide have diabetes and, according to the WHO, diabetes is predicted to become the 7th leading cause of death in the world by the year 203017. Lack of awareness about diabetes, accompanied by inadequate access to health services and drugs, can lead to severe complications such as heart attack, stroke, visual impairment and blindness, kidney failure, lower limb amputation and erectile dysfunction (IDF, 2011) . Appropriate interventions to control blood glucose levels are crucial in order to avoid those disabling and life - threatening complications that are largely preventable through relatively simple and cost effective treatments. Figure 9 , extracted from the \"Global Diabetes Plan 2011 -2021\" document, displays how effective diabetes management should work in order to prevent or delay its complications. Figure 9 Diabetes management Source: Global Diabetes Plan 2011 -2021, IDF Despite the increasing awareness of the importance of diabetes care, there are still important disparities in the access to diabetes treatment and prevention. According to the National Diabetes 17 http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/diabetes/facts/en/index1. html Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 37 Statistics Report 2014 publishe d by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), in the United States about 27.8% of people with diabetes are undiagnosed and the percentage of undiagnosed people heavily varies with ethnicity, age and gender. It is worth underlining that in the US the indirect medical cost of diabetes, such as disability, productivity loss and premature death, amounted to $69 billion in 2012, a cost that could be significantly reduced through adequate access to diabetes interventions. As regards Europe, IDF (2014) highlighted significant inequalities in access to medicines and medical devices for diabetes care, which, in the long -term, can multiply the social and indirect costs of diabetes -related complications. In order to provide an accurate picture of the lev els of unmet need for NCDs and for diabetes in particular, we reported data on the percentage of DALYs (disability -adjusted life years) lost extracted from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study database. The Global Burden of Dise ases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) is the largest and most comprehensive database on epidemiological levels and disease trends worldwide. The data, m aintained by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washing ton and c ollected and analyzed by a consortium of more than 1,000 researchers in over 100 countries, capture premature death and disability from more than 300 disease s and injuries in 188 countries. Information on death and disability are classified by age , sex and world area, from 1990 to the present, allowing comparisons over time, across age groups, and among populations. As shown by Figure 10 , Figure 11 and Figure 12 respectively, diabete s and endocrine diseases are the fourth leading cause of lost DALYs among NCDs at global, European and American level. Figure 10 NCDs Global (2010): Percentage of Lost endocrine diseasesChronic respiratory diseasesCritical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 38 Figure 11 NCDs in Europe (2010): Percentage of Lost DALYs by Disease Category Source: http://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd -compare/ Figure 12 NCDs in the United States (2010): Percentage of Lost DALYs by Disease Category Source: http://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd -compare/ Figure 13 shows the percentage of years lived with disability due to diabetes mellitus specifically. It is worth noting that diabetes ' percentage of lost DALYs is higher for high income countries (Eur ope and the United States) than for low income countries (Figure 13 ). Prevalence of diabetes, ironically, is higher in those countries that experience positiv e economic developments, such as increased wealth, better healthcare and ageing populations, because people can afford richer diets and usually adopt a more sedentary lifestyle. Among high income countries, diabetes burden is more serious in the U nited States than in Europe. After an introduction on the unmet needs related to NCD and diabetes in particular, we proceed to the investigation of how the private sector addresses diabetes related issues. In the next sections we present information on R& D investments and research pipeline of pharmaceutical and medical devices companies. 17.68% 16.97% 11.79% 6.15% 5.00% 0%5%10%15%20% endocrine diseasesChronic respiratory diseasesCritical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 39 Figure 13 Percentage of Lost United StatesCritical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 40 2.3 Pharmaceutical Sector: Research Pipeline for Diabetes Among the identified 20 top pharmaceutical companies, 9 firms have their headquarters in Europe and 11 in the United States. According to the European C ommission (2014a) , the EU pharmaceutical sector was worth \u20ac 220 billion in 2012. In the same year, it was responsible for the employment of approximately 800,000 people, accounting for 1.8% of the total manufacturing workforce. EU pharmaceutical industry has one of the highest labour productivity, with a growth in labour productivity per person employed estimated in 3.6% over the period 2006 -2011. As regards the Unites States, they are the world's largest market for pharmaceuticals and, according to data from the National Science Foundation, the U.S. biopharmaceutical sector employs more than 810,000 workers and has the largest share of US business R&D. Sixteen phar maceutical companies among the 20 identified reported to have at least one diabetes relevant molecule under development. In the next subparagraphs we will examine in detail the R&D expenditures and research pipelines of firms investing in diabetes research. 2.3.1 NOVARTIS (EUR) Novartis, a global healthcare company based in Switzerland, was created in 1996 through the merger of Ciba- Geigy and Sandoz, two companies founded in Basel between the 18th and 19th centuries.

Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 59 2.4 Discussion: The Pharmaceutical Research Pipeline for Diabetes Figure 50 reports synthesis results elaborated from the tables above. Column 3 displays for each company the percentage change in total R&D investment between 2011 and 2014. Column 4 shows the mean R& D intensity (i.e. R&D ratio on net sales) calculated over the time frame. Over the period 2011 -2014 , the European pharmaceutical sector has generally increased its R&D expenditures (column 3) and, among the top nine E uropean companies identified, only GSK suffered from a substantial decrease in investments ( -22.5%) . Novo Nordisk , on the contrary, registered the highest increase in R&D expenditures which, between 2011 and 2014, grew by approximately 48 %. US pharmaceutical companies' commitment to R& D investments has been more heterogeneous. Seven firms out of 11 registered an increase in R&D expenditures, and the most substantial increase was registered by smaller pharmaceutical companies (Gilead Sciences, Celgene and Biogen). By contrast, c ompanies at the top of the scale, like Merck and Pfizer, have substantially reduced their levels of investment. Gilead Sciences registered the highest increase in R&D expenditures of the whole sample: between 2011 and 2014, investments grew by approximately 132%. If we look at column 4, however, we notice that, despite E uropean companies registered higher increase in absolute levels of investment than US companies, the situation is reversed for R&D intensity. In fact, US companies reported on average higher value s of R&D ratio on sales over the period 2011 -2014 (US average=19; EU R average=15. 6). R&D intensity is a measure that allows to capture the relative importance of R&D among firms in the same industry, and the current findings suggest that US pharmaceutical companies generally allocate more resources in research and development activities than E uropean firms.

They have overall less diabetes relevant molecules in their pipelines than European companies (26 molecules under development for US companies compared to 40 for EU R firms). The majority of molecules developed by US and European top pharmaceutical firms are aimed at treating type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, while only few companies have developed molecules for the treatment of diabetes complications such as diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy and macular oedema. Among the eleven to p US firms, three do not have any diabetes relevant molecules under development because they are focused on other therapeutic areas; however, major companies such as Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Pfizer, Eli Lilly and Amgen show a commitment to diabetes in ter ms of pipeline development . It is worth underlining that research pipelines of US pharmaceutical companies cover a broad range of therapeutic areas, in particular serious non -communicable diseases. Only Eli Lilly, the world leader in R&D for diabetes , is specialized in developing diabetes relevant molecules among US based companies. Among European companies, only one (Merck DE) is not currently active in developing new molecules for diabetes, although diabetes is a key therapeutic area for the firm and receives an important part of investments. Interestingly, in Europe the majority of diabetes relevant molecules is developed by companies in the bottom end of the list, while only one in the top (Sanofi -Aventis) is specialized in these disease. Novo -Nordisk expressed the greatest commitment to diabetes in terms of research pipeline among the top 20 pharmaceutical firms identified, with 17 diabetes molecules in development over the period 2011 -2014. When linking these data to the the epidemiology of NCD as emerged by GBD study previously discussed , it seems that US top pharma companies' R&D commitmen t to diabetes is limited by the secondary level of burden of disease in the country while E uropean firms are more involved in developing innovative molecules for the treatment of diabetes and its complications , regardless the perceived importance of the un met need in the field . The observed discrepancy between increasing R&D investment and stalling number of new molecules discovered can be traced back to several factors, including rising attrition rates of drug Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 61 development projects, especially in late- phase clinical trials (Scannell et al., 2012), which make it difficult for new molecular entities to enter the market. According to Pammolli et al. (2011), part of the declining R&D productivity, measured as the ratio of R&D outputs to inputs, can be explaine d by an increasing focus of research activities in the development of drugs in complex research areas that are characterized by a low probability of success. Consequently, the cost of R&D (input) of new drugs has risen but the probability of producing a n ew molecule (output) has fallen. As the authors underlined, however, we should be careful in interpreting the decreasing R&D productivity because \"[...] the number of NMEs is an imperfect measure of R&D outcomes, as it does not reflect changes in the qualit y of the output. In addition, the productivity crisis might be a temporary phenomenon, as radical technological changes, such as the genomic revolution, could initially increase the time lag between investment and outcome, thereby reducing R&D productivit y in the short term\". Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 62 2.5 Medical Device Sector: Research Pipeline for Diabetes According to the Council Direct ive 93/42/EEC on Medical Devices, a Medical Device (MD) is an y instrument, apparatus, appliance, material or other article, whether used alone or in combination, including the software necessary for its proper application intended by the manufacturer to be used for human beings for the purpose of: diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of disease, diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of or compensation for an injury or handicap, investigation, replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological process, control of conception, and which does not achieve its principal intended action in or on the human body by pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means, but which may be assisted in its function by such means. Among the 16 world's top medical device c ompanies identified in Figure 8, seven companies are based in Europe while nine companies have headquarters in the US. According to European Commissio n 18, the medical devices industry (i.e. firms which manufacture, repackage, relabel, and/or import medical devices) is a major employer in Europe, employing 575,000 people in the EU, with a market size of around \u20ac100 billion. The regulation of medical devi ces in Europe was harmonized in the 1990s with three Directives issued in 1990, 1993 and 1998. Before been introduced into clinical practice, devices have to be approved and certified, obtaining a CE (Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9ene) mark (Boulton and Del Prato, 201 2). The United States is the largest medical device market in the world (the U.S. market value represented about 38 percent of the global medical device market in 2012) and its total sales amount to $110 billion19. There are more than 6,500 medical device companies in the U.S., which, overall, employ 400,000 Americans directly and almost 2 million indirectly. In the US, regulation of medical device industry is in the hands of FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH)20. According to Millennium Research Group (MRG), the global authority on medical technology market intelligence and the leading provider of strategic information to the healthcare sector, the increase in the prevalence of diabetes, combined with an expansion of insurance coverage as a consequence of healthcare reform, will cause the US diabetes care device market to grow to nearly $16 billion by 201721. Among the identified MD companies, only three of them (i.e. Alcon, Medtronic Inc. and Becton, Dickinson & Co.) have in their resear ch pipeline a device for diabetes, while the other firms are specialized in different NCDs. In the next paragraphs we will examine the top MD companies' research pipeline s and other minor companies not listed above which manufacture diabetes medical devic es. 18 http://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/medical DIABE - UB 63 2.5.0 Search strategy In order to identify new medical device under development we relied on different sources as no information on research pipelines was available from MD compan ies' annual reports. With the aim of identifying new products at the cli nical assessment stage, a database of clinical studies (i.e. clinicaltrials.gov) was searched for recently (2011) closed and ongoing clinical studies funded by each MD company identified (see Appendix 4 for detailed search strategy). Also databases of new approved MDs (i.e. FDA premarket approval, de novo database, EuroScan) have been searched according to the same time frame (2011 -2015). At the European Level, a database of CE marked products exists since 2009, called EUDAMED. This database is only accessible to government agencies in charge for the market surveillance in each country (e.g. Ministero della Salute in Italy). In the US, instead, the relevant authority, the Food and Drug Administration, has a whole section on the websi te with approval dossiers for all medical devices. Although there is not a direct link between technologies approved in the US and technologies licensed in the EU, knowledge of the most recent innovations approved overseas will provide an idea of the most up-to-date technologies that are available to improve clinical practice for the management of NCDs. Therefore, the FDA premarket approval (PMA) and de novo databases have been searched for new approved products between 2011 and 2015 (see Appendix 5 and 6 for detailed search strategy). The 510(k) clearance will not be considered as this refers to products \"substantially equivalent\" to others already on the market. In this case, unlike the previous steps, the search have been performed according to indication in cancer, respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health. Besides the FDA databases, the EuroScan Database has been searched. In Europe there is not an equivalent of the FDA online databases of new approved devices. We theref ore relied on the EuroScan database. EuroScan is the International Information work on New and Emerging Health Technologies, a collaborative work of member health technology assessment ( HTA) agencies for the exchange of information on important emerging n ew drugs, devices, procedures, programmes, and settings in health care. Many European HTA agencies are members of the work (e.g. Agenas from Italy, NIHR Horizon Scanning Centre from UK, Osteba from Spain, SBU from Sweden etc.). As for the FDA databases, the search has been performed according to indication in the five NCD areas (see Appendix 7 for detailed search strategy). 2.5.1 JOHNSON & JOHNSON (US) Johnson & Johnson is a global company which manufactures pharmaceuticals, medical devices and consumer healthcare products . It is the world's largest and most diverse medical devices company . Johnson & Johnson was founded by the three Johnson brothers in 1886 and it is headquartered in New Brunswick, New Jersey .

The search was performed on Web of Science (see Section 4 for methodological details) and carried out under the bibliometric DIABE filter. It must be noted that the aliases/ spelling errors in naming the RFOs by WoS means that not all them may have been captured or that other organizations may have accidentally been captured due to the simplistic terms used. In cases in which a company had only generic codes, the name of the company itself was searched instead of the code. In RESPI and DIABE the funding data searched also include papers in which the company was listed among the addresses; for the other NCDs only the funding data were searched. It should also be noted that some of the companies also develop pharmaceutical products, thus the counts of papers may include them. Johnson & Johnson and Alcon seem to dominate diabetes research outputs, with 271 and 267 scientific papers respectively published between 2009 and 2013. It is worth underlining, however, that these two companies also develop medicines for the treatment of diabetes, so the numbers above may have captured also scientific studies regarding pharmaceutical products. Medtronic, the major producer of diabetes me dical devices in our sample, published 127 studies, but, contrary to Johnson & Johnson and Alcon, it produces only medical technologies so the count of papers does not include any pharmaceutical product. Overall, with the exceptions of Stryker Corp and th e two companies not searched, all top MD firms have published several studies on diabetes over the period considered. These results are quite in contrast with the findings of the analysis of research pipelines, since we found that only 3 companies are cur rently investing in new MD. There are three possible explanations for this discrepancy: 1) as already underlined, some companies are involved also in the pharmaceutical segment so the counts of papers may have also included drugs; 2) some companies may no t be lead sponsor in clinical trials so our search in clinicaltrials.gov database may have not found them; 3) study protocols might have been registered elsewhere or not registered at all; 4 ) some studies published may regard existing products , which are n ot captu red in the search of pipelines because only innovative MDs were considered.

Column 4 shows the mean R&D intensity (i.e. R&D ratio on net sales) calculated over the time frame. Over the period 2011 -2014, the medical device sector commitment to R&D investments has been substantially heterogeneous . Among companies based in Europe , one firm (i.e. Allergan ) registered an impressive increase in absolute R&D investments (+378% between 2011 and 2014), another (i.e. Covidien) experienced a slight decrease in expenditures, and the remaining companies registered a moderate growth of expenditures. The landscape for US firms is more heterogeneous , in fact half companies experienced a modest decrease in R&D investments and the other half a more substantial increase. As regards R&D intensity, US firms generally record higher levels of R&D ratio on sales than European companies: US mean R&D intensity is approximately equal to 8.5, while for Europe is 5.6. These findings suggest that, overall, US medical devices companies allocate more resources in research and development activities than EUR firms.

Only three companies out of 16 (i.e. Medtronic; Alcon; Becton, Dickinson & Co.) are currently involved in the production of innovative diabetes medical devices. Medtronic has been the major developer over the period considered, followed by Becton, Dickins on & Co. and then by Alcon, with only one MD in its pipeline. Many top companies identified are specialized in other NCD categories, but some (for example Johnson & Johnson and Boston Scientific ), despite providing solutions for diabetes, are not currently developing any innovative medical device in this area. Diabetes medical devices consist of a wide range of products that, according to the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), include insulin pumps, insulin pens, aids f or insulin users, glucose monitoring devices (self- monitoring blood glucose and continuous glucose monitor) , glucose products, blood glucose meters and infusion sets. Medtronic is mainly involved in the development of insulin pumps, glucose monitoring dev ices and infusion sets. Becton, Dickinson & Co. is specialized in the production of pen needles, but it also develops infusion sets and CGM (continuous glucose monitor) systems. These two companies produce devices for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 d iabetes mellitus, while Alcon is focused on devices for the treatment of eye problems induced by diabetes. Probably the most striking observation from the analysis of companies' research pipelines is that, among top medical device firms, only few of them invest in research and development of diabetes devices. This seems to suggest that diabetes is still receiving low attention by the MD world, despite being one of the top 10 causes of disability worldwide . Another reason could be that it is difficult to tackle through medical device technologies a disease which is essentially metabolic and to address with pharmacologically active substance in first instance. In any case, there are known existing limitations that hinder the innovation process for the MD sector , especially in Europe. For example, European medical device industry recognizes that \"[...] the regulatory system needs an overhaul due to increased expectations and technological advances, and acknowledges that positive change is necessary to improve Europe's medical device regulatory framework\" (Eucomed, 2014). Moreover, as underlined by IDF's report \"Access to quality medicines and medical devices for diabetes care in Europe\", European countries do not have the same availability of tre atment options due to the unequal number and types of products marketed in each country. Moreover, accessibility t o optimum diabetes treatment is undermined by inequalities in access to appropriate continuous education for people with diabetes and their re latives. According to the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) 22, it is necessary to develop collaborations between academic medical societies, regulatory bodies and industry in order to improve diabetes care in the area of medical devices . These aspects are also picked up in the next section as emerging themes from the stakeholders' interviews ( see section UB 85 3 Stakeholder Interviews: Diabetes An established trend observed across the EU over the last decades is a decline in diffusion of infectious and communicable diseases that, however, makes people more exposed to develop and suffer from debilitating NCDs, among which diabetes has a primary role (Lozano et al., 2012) . According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by an increased and maintained concentration of glucose in the blood. Prolonged raised blood sugar levels lead to serious microvascular and macrovascular complic ations that may result in organ and system failure. Four main aetiological categories of diabetes mellitus (DM) have been identified: type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), other specific types of DM and gestational DM (WHO, 199 9). The former is characterized by a lack of insulin production and it is often called childhood -onset diabetes or insulin -dependent diabetes. On the other hand, type 2 diabetes is caused by cells' ineffective use of insulin, often due to overweight and lack of exercise. Gestational diabetes is a state of hyperglycaemia that develops during pregnancy without previously known diabetes, whilst other specific types of diabetes include rare forms collectively identified as monogenic diabetes (Colom and Corco y, 2010) or diabetes secondary to other pathological conditions (WHO, 1999). Long- term prevalence and incidence in diabetes show increasing trends (Chen et al., 2012). In 2014, the WHO estimated the global prevalence of diabetes to be 9% among adults ( 18 years), with 1.5 million of directly associated deaths. Although, more than 80% of diabetes deaths occur in low - and middle -income countries, in the European Region this condition accounts for 634.000 deaths every year and 11% of all deaths in the age 20 -79 years (Roglic and Unwin, 2010). Almost half are people aged under 70 years (Roglic and Unwin, 2010). Diabetes deaths worldwide almost doubled between 1990 and 2010, in contrast to what happened for most diseases, including major vascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, most forms of cancer, liver cirrhosis, and maternal disorders (Lozano et al., 2012). Epidemiological studies suggest that diabetes is related to non -modifiable risk factors, as ageing of the population, genetic facto rs and gender, but the increasing prevalence is mostly due to modifiable risk factors as overweight and obesity, tobacco use, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity, and socioeconomic disadvantage. Of course, these risk factors are closely connected to the risks for other NCDs, such as CVDs, CRDs and cancer. Hence, diabetes represents a critical issue in all discussions and publications around NCDs prevention and control, and health strategies for diabetes must be integrated into population approaches to prevent NCDs as a group (Jakab, 2010). Because of the many modifiable risk factors, diabetes is largely preventable. Across Europe, policy - makers engaged in funding research not only for developing interventions but also to promote prevention strategies to mitigate the impact of this disease. Through the survey stage of MAPPING_NCDs project, we identified 120 Research Funding Organizations (RFOs) investing in diabetes research. In Eastern Europe, all RFOs are government organizations, and third sector RFOs do not exist. In Western Europe, there is a greater number of charitable and voluntary sector RFOs. In all cases, however, few of these RFOs (1 3, 11%) are devoted exclusively to diabetes research, and Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 86 the majority makes research investments in other NCD disease areas. While accurate mapping of RFOs and their funding activities via surveys and bibliometrics can assist government in identifying the most fruitful approaches to NCD investments research; policy makers must also take account of the often strong visions and firm priorities of leaders in the field of diabetes research. To this end, MAPPING_NCDs necessarily involves the conduct of semi- structured interviews as a means for eliciting the preferences and opinions of key diabetes stakeholders. In this way, the project opens a dialogue with diabetes researchers and investors on the basis that qualitative interviews hold the potential to develop wider theory and hypothesis for both mapping diabetes research funding, and also improving the relevan ce, efficiency and impact of research investment (Wright et al ., 2014). To some extent, new strategies and funding initiatives for diabetes research must align with the scientific, clinical and economic priorities and interests of leaders in the field. For this reason, the mapping of diabetes research activities need s to consider stakeholder motivation and views for improving research investment strategies and outcomes for diabetes . Stakeholders are located at various points of the diabetes research proc ess. For the purpose of this project, stakeholders can either be directly associated with NCD research or involved in making research investments in NCD research. At both of these points, MAPPING_NCDs makes contact with stakeholders, seeking their views on both the current and future state of funding for diabetes research. In terms of funding in diabetes , this typically originates from a variety of sources: national governments (EU MSs), international organizations or non -governmental organizations with regional or global reach (e.g. OECD, WHO Regional Office for Europe), the private sector (pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industry), charities or not -for-profit organizations (e.g. European Diabetes Foundation, Diabetes UK , Italian Banking Foundations ), and, importantly, supranational organizations (e.g. European Commission) as well as public -private partn erships (e.g. the Innovative Medicines Initiative). As a research methodology, semi- structured interviews provide opportunity to develop hypotheses about the future shape of research funding in diabetes. Enabling close collaboration between the interviewe rs and stakeholders, interviews allow stakeholders to describe their views of the current state of research and to improve interviewer's understandings of the key factors influencing the current and future shape of research on diabetes. They hold a capaci ty to answer the 'how' and 'why' of diabetes research funding, allowing interviewers to understand how funding activities are influenced by individuals and the contexts in which they are embedded (Baxter and Jack 2008, 556). Consequently, interviews have the potential to improve the quality of the wider mapping exercise by providing researchers with more complete understandings of causes and effects, enabling them to develop better ideas for future funding strategies that target more relevant factors. Ultimately, the purpose of the stakeholder interviews is to open a sophisticated and collaborative dialogue between decision makers and key personnel involved in the diabetes research system with a view to producing a more nuanced map of research funding activities , and thereby heighten the potential for future research investment in the area. Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 87 3.1 Methods Stakeholders were purposively selected to reflect a range of factors including: expertise in diabetes research, geographic location and expertise in awarding research funding or conducting research as a principal investigator (PI). The interview questions explored (1) current threads of research; (2) future research areas; (3) types of collaborations; (4) working with collaborators; (5) working with the private sector ; (6) types of funding organizations; (7) working with funding organizations; (8) future strategies for funding NCD research , with slight differences for PIs or RFOs' representatives . A copy of the interview guide is available in the Appendix 8. All interviews we re recorded and transcribed. Consent was gained for all interview subjects and their anonymity. Transcripts were typed verbatim, proof read and corrected, while notes and comments were collected and made into memos. They were analysed qualitatively using inductive thematic analysis (Silverman, 2004). Constant comparative approach was used to iteratively identify emerging themes that will contribute to generate a vision about future research funding strategies across the EU to tackle g aps and challenges currently perceived by experts in the field (Bradley EH, Curry LA, and Devers KJ 2007). Quotes from the interviews are included to explain or illustrate key points. While retaining anonymity, the speakers have been identified by a nume rical code in order to allow readers to distinguish different voices. Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 88 3.2 Results In total, 11 interviews were conducted. Personnel were selected to reflect a range of geographical regions across the EU. We had interviewees from Italy (3 out of 11), UK (3 out of 11), Ireland (1 out of 11), France (1 out of 11), Portugal (1 out of 11), Estonia (1 out of 11) and the Netherlands (1 out of 11). The aim was to solicit views and experiences of people involved in both the conduct (4 out of 11) and funding (7 out of 1 1) of research across the EU area. Principal investigators had different scientific interests within diabetes research: from drugs mechanisms evaluation to clinical development of therapeutic alternatives in childhood and adolescence to unders tanding the pathophysiology of vascular complications of diabetes and identification of suitable interventions. They were all affiliated with University Hospitals around the EU. In terms of RFOs represented, most of them were private not- for-profit organ izations or charities dedicated to advance the understanding of causes, prevention and cure of diabetes through research . In two cases, the RFOs were funding research across a spectrum of diseases, including many other NCDs that are the focus in the MAPPI NG_NCD project. Below major emerging themes are presented and illustrated through direct quotes from the interviews. 3.2.1. Challenges in diabetes research The informant touched upon several themes when asked to reflect on the challenges perceived in the current research environment in diabetes. A first major theme relates to financial challenges . Informants generally claim that more money are needed or that they have observed a decrease in available funding over time, also due to the harsh economic crisis that hit Europe since 2008. This observation is common to informants from different geographic origins: \"Funding has decreased over time.\" (2) \"Economic recession has resulted in less money going to foundations\" (6) \"A main challenge is to be able to continue to fund high quality research, which is obviously difficult given the financial situation in [country].\" (4) On the same theme, the informants emphasize the competition among sponsors and research teams to get access to adequate level of fundi ng, to cover for infrastructure, consumables, technical support and staff. \"We really see that researchers are applying a lot, this means there isn't enough money available for them in [country]. [...] This is very critical for them, they are fighting to get the money they need for the best projects they have.\" (8) \"The answer is more money but I don't think that's going to happen somehow! [...] you are scoping so much out to get the money in, that you spend half of your life to get grants in and there is suc h a small proportions of people achieving but I don't know how that's going to change in the near future.\" (11) The competition and the unstable level of funding put team leaders under pressure to secure continuous funding for the team. The management of human resources can be critical within the Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 89 current research environment for both financial or organizational constraints, such as the requirement for trainees to rotate across labs or units (2) or to limit the possibility to apply for grants only to researchers who have already a permanent post (11): \"What's important then is having more stable funding for the team [...] it can be very t ough for your people [...] If you don't have other money you have t o stop their contracts .\" (8) \"[...] young researchers, being able to help them find a career path that allows them to stay after they reach a certain level. \" (4) Given this context, one of the PIs pointed out the importance of good management skills training for researchers, something that is often overlooked in the ir curricula (11). According to the informants, the private sector is the main source of funding in diabetes research sometimes because it is perceived to be more accessible compared to public funding, particularly for Southern and Eastern EU researchers . \"In terms of research activity, considerable funding comes from private sources, pharmaceutical companies. Public funding is limited and difficult to access. [...] Funding from EU level is also limited. [...] Private funding sources will continue to be the mo st relevant\" (2) In any case, this is considered to be a problem as private companies do not necessarily have the interest to invest in all areas where there is need or where risks are higher. \"[...] t he treatment trials, 99% are funded by the industry, so this is clearly a problem.\" (10) \"[...] industry, which of course invests in research but invests in research in these areas where there are huge returns, some of the chronic diseases may not, and therefore the research in really really new therapies, not the one slightly improving existing drugs, may be neglected.\" (7) The heterogeneity of funding opportunities is therefore something to preserve and develop into different forms of collaboration within and between countries, and across different types of RFOs. An example that was cited from overseas is the joint effort between the National Institute of Health (NIH) in the United States and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) that win d together supporting research (5). Another example was about Diabetes UK and British Heart Foundation joining up to look at areas of interest at the intersection between the mission of the two organizations (11). \"Heterogeneity across Europe can be a goo d thing, national governments are supplementary in funding research.\" (10) \"How do you make sure that all these pieces [ndr, individual PhDs or large scale programs] come together, that actually we can make a significant step forward instead? [...] You need to find a way of collaborating, it's almost like seeding money to make sure that people develop small scale ideas, and if it turns out to be fruitful then maybe it becomes a large scale consortia. \" (6) This cooperation between funding bodies seems a useful strategy to tackle the complex and multidimensional issues posed by diabetes as a health condition. Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 90 \"The more we get to know about diabetes, the more we get to see it's a complicated condition. [...] we need to combine all this research and various methods and various areas of research to really come up with a significant progress of understanding diabetes and finding betters ways of preventing and treating it. \" (6) The collaborative approach is also needed from the researchers side. The creation of stron g and stable collaborative networks within and between countries will speed up the pace at which we will move forward on achieving the important targets set for global diabetes research. \"High quality research requires collaboration between researchers [...] It takes a long time to recruit patients, to get enough patients, unless we have collaborative or network research not just within countries but between countries\" (5) In terms of challenges, a final aspect was mentioned by one of the informants and seem ed very relevant to the whole MAPPING_NCDs project. This expert marked as \"huge political error\" (7) the recent trend of combining chronic diseases under the same umbrella term of 'non -communicable diseases' and the same provision of services for conditions that are inherently different . The critique to the combined NCD -wide approach should be discussed and motivated further by health policy makers: \"The emphasi s on NCDs, it means that the specific disease within the NCDs definition lose s out, they may have a communality of being non communicable but the other commonalities are few [...] each of diseases is specific in its own rights and burden of complication, needing a very different approach. [...] they are now all under one common umbrella and nothing has been done properly. A real adverse effect in terms of health policy. \" (7) 3.2.2. Duplication in diabetes research The debate on waste in scientific research is a contemporary one (Macleod et al. , 2014) . We asked our informants whether they pe rceived a significant level of duplication in diabetes research and if so, whether this has negative implications. The general feeling was that there is a degree of duplication of studies in diabetes, however this is not necessarily a bad thing. The risk is with the publication bias that reduces the likelihood of publishing negative results. That means there is unfortunately a higher probability of repeating unsuccessful research projects . However, particularly for intervention studies where the external validity dimensions play a significant role in determining the outcomes of the treatments , it is somehow beneficial to be able to replicate results in different settings : \"If it is at biomedical level than obviously there is no point in repeating the res earch but if it is a patient -services level it may be beneficial to repeat the research on different target populations \" (4) \"I think there is (ndr, duplication) particularly when you get negative findings or negative studies because there is a bias in publication or people don't like to publish negative results. But I also do think is good to have things confirmed in research because I think sometimes what you re ad in the paper isn't necessary the whole story, so some degree of duplication can be good because it can verify some aspects or in slight different patients groups. \" (11) Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 91 One informant refers to EU projects, in particular making the point that they may ap pear redundant at first glance, whilst in reality they are complementary and cover all different sides of the problem: \"I think sometimes we even see duplication in the EU projects themselves. But I think that's only at first look. If you look closely t he different projects come with different approaches [...] in a way some of them have a focus in research, others have a focus in policy, others have a focus in producing new services and products. In reality they can help each other .\" (9) From the perspecti ve of the researchers, although there is a great pressure to \"match the funder's expectations\" (11), duplication of calls is considered as a good opportunity to pursue research on the subject of interest. However, what does not seem acceptable is to have different grants paying into the same research projects. When a research proposal is successful with more than one sponsor, it would make sense to keep one of the grants to fully fund the project, and move the other funding to a different still promising research idea. \"I don't think that there is unnecessary duplication either by funding bodies or indeed researchers. I think in many ways is good to have many of these funding bodies offering opportunities to do research in an area where we are interest ed in through specific calls. So I wouldn't look at the duplication, because it's not a hindrance but it's actually perhaps a way for us offering more opportunities to secure funding.\" (5) \"We know that our teams who get funding from us also get other grants. But we can't go against this because we have a scientific committee that select all the best projects, and it's true is likely that these projects will be also selected by other committe es. We try to be careful [...] we ask them to choose which money t o keep, from one or the other [...] to stop our funds because ERC are paying millions Euros .\" (8) 3.2.3. Research gaps Clinically, informants pointed out significant scope remains for improving outcomes for diabetes patients, particular in terms of aetiology , prevention and development of new treatments research. According to the informants, the \"pathogenesis of hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events \" or \"pathogenesis of chronic complications \" needs further understanding (1, 11). In terms of new treatments, on the short- term the focus could be on the study of \"the molecular basis of actions of insulin or optimization of insulin pumps\" (2), whilst in the long- term the identification of \"new molecular targets, the development of the artificial pancreas , beta- cells transplant , conversion of cell lines not producing insulin and control of auto -immunity\" seem all promising but still underinvestigated areas (2). Childhood or adolescence diabetes, or more generally type 1 diabetes is the specific condition where a cure is much needed (6) and there is more limited funding available (5). In T1DM, another area that deserves more interest is: \"[...] the use of what we call adjunct therapies , so these are additional drug agents [ndr enhancement of insulin action, (e.g. the biguanides and thiazolidinediones), alteration of gastrointestinal nutrient delivery (e.g. acarbose and amylin), and other targets of action (e.g. pirenzepine and insulin- like growth fact or-1 [IGF -1], growth hormone secretion, and glucagon- like peptide -1, which acts to stimulate insulin secretion] in addition to insulin for managing type 1 diabetes.\" (5) Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 92 Prevention becomes more relevant in terms of type 2 diabetes and concerns not only typical public health interventions aiming at eradicating sedentary lifestyles but also genetic, environmental and other risk factors that predispose to the development of the disease: \"[...] developing diabetes prevention cause we still have a ver y big prevalence that is being fed by high number of people with pre -diabetes and of course all the societal challenges that drive the incidence of diabetes. \" (9) \"As a foundation we still believe that's something that we should be funding [ndr, prevention of type II diabetes ] cause we want to prevent people from having diabetes in the future [...] there is more in terms of preventing diabetes than just focusing on diet and physical activity. [...] There may be something in genetics, something in our environment or other factors that are still unknown and we need to research in order to do something about them. \" (6) At a more generalized level, and as emerging from other NCD stakeholders' interviews, some informants insisted that the future for research lay in relation to personalized medicine . Sometimes called 'stratified medicine', personalized medicine involves the practice of subdividing patients into groups based on their responses to therapies or their risk profile for developing certain disease conditions . Ultimately, stratified medicine is using knowledge of patients and disease pathways to ensure that the right patients, receive the right types of medicine at the right times. Towards this end, it is also about early diagnosis and predicting the onset o f disease using biological markers that divide patients in to groups for the purpose treating the disease much earlier. \"The key element that should be invested in is personalized medicine, genomics. So I think it does need to be a great investment in t his area so that it can be speeded up. There is some evidence on personalized medicine for cancer drugs but in diseases such as diabetes this remains a neglected area. \" (7) However, genomics is not the panacea to defeat diabetes (\"We all have the wish that genetics will give us the answer to diabetes but it is complex!\" (6)). The informants have raised the attention on the psychosocial aspects of living with diabetes and the need to improved the health related quality of life of th is group of patients. One of the informants told us this was a topic emerging from a survey conducted among diabetes patients who said: \"We want more focus on the psycho -social aspects of diabetes. Diabetes is a lot more than measuring or administering m edications, diabetes is something that you have 24h a day, 7 days a week and especially for type I the impact is very high. So they asked what about this psychological aspects, what about depression, what about quality of life\" (6) This view was confirmed by a PI as well: \"[...] more funding on psychosocial management of diabetes or psychosocial aspects of diabetes, because my feeling is [...] I think we are almost at the limit of both technologies and currently available therapies and the limitations with th ese therapies is very much down to patients and carers [...] I think we need to address how we make patients and families more engaged with the treatment and how we get them to use the treatment much more effectively. \" (5) Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 93 In terms of tools or infrastructure that might be useful to speed the research up b io-banks or patient registries should be set up and maintained to allow high quality studies on significant sample sizes and across countries. \"The availability of bio -banks and funding to set them up. This is an issue that should be addressed in order to move on to the next level. So for instance if I wanted to research on people newly diagnosed with diabetes, there isn't a registry available to researchers and neither are samples kept. Other countries wo uld be able to access the bio -banks of tissues and bloods that may be reserved as part of their practice .\" (4) \"And also the other aspect is that , with the exception of Sweden which is the only country that has a reliable up- to date diabetes register of disease , no other country has this. The other important aspect in relation to the research in diabetes is also the accurate recording of clinical o utcome, not done! \" (7) In terms of most important stages of research to invest in translational research is a common one (9,3). Translational research \"translate s\" findings of basic research into medical and nursing practice in order to obtain meaningful health outcomes. In other words, it implements the \"bench -to- bedside\" paradigm , from laboratory experiments through clinical trials to practical applications, clinically or commercially available. \"the type of research that produces (more easily) new knowledge. To address unsolved medical issues you need to start from preclinical research, that is our aim, to find new solutions to health and scientific problems\" (3) However, \"funding research that allows immediate impact on the lives of people with diabetes\" (4) or very innovative and highly risky research, as \"some projects between different disciplines, really at the hedge of innovation research\" (8) were also identified as priorities. Finally, the research in the \"economic impact of the disease\" may be missing in some countries , even if the assessment of the costs for both the patients and the healthcare system could better inform some of the policies. (9) 3.2.4. Defining impact of research and setting priorities The informants reflected on what achieving impact means from the perspective of a funder or a researcher. Both group mentioned the scienti fic publication as a propaedeutic step (1,2,3,8,9,11) . \"Of course publication and dissemination are vital\" (4) Some RFOs actively track acknowledgeme nts to the sponsor in the published outputs in order to increase their prestige and encourage future donations (1,3,8). A published academic publication can also be a formal requirement for receiving the last tranche of money or future grants by particular funders (11). In terms of dissemination , other showcases reaching the general public seem also important. \"Is there any patent? Publication? Presentation at meetings? Have your research been in the newspapers? Have you been interviewed by scientifi c TV programmes? And also one thing that is important for us as a way to measure impact of the research we are trying to see whether these people are getting ERC funding. \" (8) Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 94 This informant also gives a metric to understand whether the research being funded at her organization is valuable. However, the definition of impact goes beyond academic publishing. \"I think there is a broader dimension, the impact on common goods, a r apid shift onto the diagnostic or therapeutic practice as expressed by the change in the clinical guidelines. However, this is difficult to measure as behind this change there could be one, two or three interrelated papers and a long sequence of propaedeutic research that lead until the final update .\" (1) How to account for partial contributions to the advance in the biomedical and clinical research, then? Another broader view was on the impact as \"development of Health Services in [country]\" (4) or impact on \"patients and the big society\" (5): \"The impact is on patient health outcomes . I think every time we are submitting funding applications we have to address the impact aspect, it's no longer just acceptable to be focus sed on the science so to speak but also on how this might be transferable into improvement of healthcare or healthcare delivery. \" (5). \"Findings can be very interesting from a scientific point of view but if there is no relevance of these findings for people with diabetes than for us that means that the impact is reduced. It takes a long time be fore the results reach a person [...] hence , we include patient s in the selection process as well .\" (6) Priorities may change as a result of this broader view on what to expect from biomedical and clinical research. Although many calls are still \"open, to reward quality rather than steer research\" (1), meaning that there is no prespecified topic to do research on, sh owing impact on the patients and society beyond scientific excellence may lead to different approaches to priority -setting. On the one hand, research into the communication and implementation of previous results become more important ( \"I think many resear ch come up with very interesting findings but it has proven to be very difficult to then make the next step and make sure that these results are communicated or implemented or find a way into a product or a service that people with diabetes can use. \" (6)). On the other hand, d onors' awareness has improved over time so that transparency and a greater accountability of all research funders is needed to keep the engagement high in the research environment. \"Before we used to have very generic research programs, and basically asking people if they wanted to support our research programs and that was enough, but nowadays we have to be much more specific and say this is what we are trying to do in curing type I diabetes. \" (6) 3.2.5. Working with different stakeholders During the interviews the opportunity and different modality of cooperation between funders and researchers emerged under several themes. First of all, there could be different reasons to engage in a collaboration with other stakeholders during the overall research process, from the basic need to co-finance big projects (1, 5, 9, 11) to allocation of different roles. It has been highlighted that foundations or not -for-profit organizations' activities could have the status and expertise to act as promoters of education or dissemination to the general public of the findings from the major research initiatives. Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 95 \"We as a foundation can also play an important role in disseminating the findings of projects to a wider audience . We do it for a number of EU funded projects, and I think it helps to the goals not only of the EU commission but also of the MS that the researchers\" (6) As regards T1DM research, \"a more direct engagement with the major scientific societie s\" (5) was invoked to steer the agenda setting for major European projects. In Northern EU countries, the good practice of involving member of the public or patie nts associations in every stage of the research process, from the identification of priorities for multiyear research programs t o design of specific projects was reported. Public and patient involvement (PPI) in research is more and more expected if not required by funders (Greenhalgh, 2009) . According to the NHS advisory group INVOLVE, PPI is \"research being carried out 'with' o r 'by' members of the public rather than 'to', 'about' or 'for' them\" and ideally encompasses involvement, participation and engagement of the general population (INVOLVE, 2015). This approach is missing according to the experience of PIs in Southern EU c ountries (2). \"Some programs also have a patient advisory boards especially for funding programs that are aimed at either incrementing research or communication or valorization of research funding where we say these projects should be not only be of scientific excellence but it should also be very clear what is the societal relevance for people with diabetes. That part of the project we ask a group of patients to give their judgment on. So it is a combination of scientific judgment as well as the people judgment that advise us on what projects to fund. \" (6) \"Some funders require you to have a PPI member on the steering committee or even as an applicant to the funding, or some others require that you have consulted some sort of PPI group and you have involved them in the process. \" (11) The almost unanimous consensus on the need of collaboration in research seems to contradict the emerging theme of the national approach to the funding of diabetes research by the charities or not - for-profit RFOs. This finding confirms a previous result from the survey of RFOs across the EU showing that 45% of the survey RFOs operates at national level and 2 9% at sub -national level. \"Our aim is to keep or attract good scientists to do research in [country]. \" (3) \"To improve the availability of research funding to researchers in [country] so that they can have a better career path\" (4) \"We try to fund research that teams in [country] can apply to. \" (8) One informant mentioned research funding initiatives beyond the national territories as a way for the local teams to progress and improve as a result of the exposure to international collaborations (9). 3.2.6. The EU role The role played by the EU in the field of research funding across the region encompasses different levels of action. First of all, the EU is perceived as one of the biggest funders, although some informants point out the inadequate level of investment of EU in diabetes (2, 5, 10): Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 96 \"One of the problems that I see particularly with EU funding for pediatric diabetes is often there isn't much available\" (5) Although, they also recognize tha t resources are scarce and competition to access the funding is justified by the need to cover several different fields of research. Some informants express satisfaction for current and prospective research plans . \"Well, you can always ask for more money. Of course Horizon 2020 is very competitive and the fact that when you submit projects it's more likely that won't win than win but I think the opportunities are there [...] \" (9) \"I am one of the happiest persons with EU collaboration [...] The projects act ually running try to cover empowerment of patients, professional training, healthcare policies, new tools like ICT, so more or less the areas that I can think about are covered. [...] I think I am happy with the current policy and strategies. \" (9) \"So I thin k it's very important and it does give opportunities through these targeted big programs. I think they are just doing one in diabetic retinopathy and age -related macular degeneration and that's really good for us. They have a very critical role in current and future research in diabetes.\" (11) On a different note, some informants expressed disappointment in the priority -setting for EU calls in childhood diabetes, associating the misidentification to failing in consulting the appropriate type of experts (i.e. paediatric endocrinologists): \"Particularly with EU funding for pediatric diabetes there isn't much available and it is often not focus sed on the main issues. I suspect the problem with funding through the EU is the advice or expert advice that they are getting is not perhaps in tune with what really needs to happen and by whom. [...] I think they need to have better advice from the available experts in the EU. I think the committees - my understanding is - often do not have pe diatricians nor people who have got any particular expertise in childhood and young people diabetes. I think a wider net has to be cast to get those experts to get that advice.\" (5) According to the experts, \"the EU is the best position for an umbrella view coordination\" (6), o r \"one body whe re research can be done, Europe -wide \" (4). As nicely expressed by one of the informant PI, the opportunity to take part in big cross -country initiatives, with many academic and non -academic partners involved is highly valued and also attach ed to a legacy that will likely turn out into new ideas for international collaborations: \"I think that's been a really good initiative [ndr, a EU FP7 Project in diabetes] [...] All the network, all pharma together, all different academic partners and it has given a chance to build up a whole big program with time , and I think the legacy effect of these collaborations occurring, and some feeding into many other big projects in the future. \" (11) EU is also in a leadership role to recommend, guide and commissi on highly specialized research on unfashionable topics: \"Recommendations at the EU level obviously have an important impact locally, so any suggestion they can make is obviously a great benefit. \" (4) Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 97 \"If other agencies (universities or industries) are not doing it - the (European) Commission itself take s on the responsibility to ask to particular actors to work on specific topics. [...] In my view they could take the lead to commission maybe particular universities, who have a good record, in a collaborative way. \" (7) What the EU seem to fail in the process is a fruitful discussions with all the stakeholders . It would be much more beneficial to involve all different funding bodies, including charities and not-for-profit organizations, in strategic discussions around research funding priorities that it only seems a missed opportunity failing to achieve such participatory approach, also because in many countries non - public organizations often spend more than public organizations in diabetes research. \"EU discuss es these things with national member states, national funding agencies, and that perfectly makes sense but I think we should consider there are more funding agencies not only government subjects [...]. So involv ing not only member state agencies but also other funders, we are the major funder in [country], but it's our national government that has a discussion with the EU on how we should address diabetes, that doesn't make sense. The same can be said of the UK, Diabetes UK is a major funder of diabetes research in the UK but it's the M edical Research Council that is part of the discussion within the EU and the Commission. That's a challenge for Europe, not only talk with the representatives of MS but also include the private foundations and other funding agencies in various member states.\" (6) The engagement of different stakeholders should be agreed upon with all parties. On this same theme, the opposite position was recorded by a RFO 's representative claiming autonomy and independence in setting her foundations' research priorities based on donors' preferences: \"The problem is we are a private organization, we have private money [...] We are very independent and we want to be independent because it's peo ple's money and private donors. We have our own policy to define what we want to fund, trying not to be redundant with things that are done by the Government or other Foundations. It's not public money. \" (8) Finally, there were heterogeneous suggestions in terms of specific requests to raise to the EU to facilitate or speed up the research process and efficiency within the region. From harmonized fiscal policies around deductions on donations for research ini tiatives (8) to enforcing the set up of national bio -banks, updated at national level and accessible through an adequate process of ethical approval for well- designed projects (4). A more critical task would be \"try to help diminish a little those gaps in terms of diabetes healthcare\" (9). This statement was associated to the observation that insulin pumps are not equally provided around Europe, mainly due to financial constraints but also to different healthcare and reimbursement systems that bring diffe rent choices and opportunities for citizens in each EU country . Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 98 3.3 Discussion and Conclusion The themes emerged from the stakeholders interviews were organized in six major areas: i) challenges in diabetes research, ii) duplication in diabetes research , iii) research gaps, iv) impact of research and priority -setting, v) partnerships and vi) the role of the EU. According to the informants, the challenges faced by researchers and RFOs in diabetes research are financial (i.e. a perceived decrease in targe ted funding over the last years, mainly associated with the economic crisis that hit Europe in 2008) and organizational. In particular, human resources management can be difficult in a very competitive environment, with scarce resources available and long prospects of temporary or insecure employment for most of the workforce. The majority of diabetes research funding was coming from private pharmaceutical companies according to our informants . They suggest that industry has implemented conservative mana gement practices for the purpose of increasingly the predictability of drug discovery and the sustainability of returns on capital investment in R&D. Sources in the literature argue that investments in R&D produce NMEs that are, at best, only marginally b etter than existing therapies, thereby stifling innovation and amplifying a sense of crisis across the industry (Munos and Chin 2011 ). Looking at the future, sources in the literature fear that unless industry ceases to pursue \"safe\" risk -averse managemen t strategies, unless it adopts more collaborative approaches to knowledge creation and costs sharing, few breakthroughs will reach patients and sufferers of disease (Munos and Chin 2011 ). Developing the right balance through cooperation between heterogeneous list s of funders is therefore critical to foster the advance in scientific and clinical research. Duplication can only apparently be considered a challenge. Turning redundant funding in opportunities to tackle the most underinvestigated are as or replicat ing results in setting s where generalizability can be an issue , were common discussion points. A general broader view on the impact of research was supported. Stakeholders recognized the importance of looking beyond academic publications, b eyond \"scientific excellence \" to promote impact on delivery of services and patient health outcomes. This approach involves a relatively higher consideration of translational or implementation research and highlight s the importance of general public invol vem ent in all stages of research. Establishing partnership s for the funding and conduct of research seems a successful strategy to be able to co -fund bigger project, to explore research questions on large scale or to achieve dissemination targets otherwis e unlikely. In terms of research gaps or unmet need, informants pointed out the broad area of aetiology (i.e. pathogenesis of hypo/hyperglycaemic events, pathogenesis of chronic complications), prevention (i.e. genetic factors linked to the adult developm ent of T2DM) or treatment (i.e. adjunct therapies, artificial pancreas, beta -cell transplantation, cell line conversion ). Personalized medicine was also promoted in this field as it has already spread in other areas such as oncology. However, the unspeci fic NCD -wide approach to research and management of very different conditions only grouped for the fact of not being infectious was criticized. As regards infrastructure s, bio -banks development was the most recommended suggestion to speed up genetic -based studies. Another probably unexpected topic suggested for future research was on the social and health related quality of life aspects of people living with the disease, how it is possible to make patients and families more engaged with the treatment and how to get them to use the treatment more effectively . In this regard, a wide set of skills and multidisciplinary research projects are necessary to tackle a disease that is more complex than the genetics behind it. Finally, the role attributed to the EU is one of coordination and leadership. Recommendations from the field to one of the major public government funding body Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 99 goes from engagement in fruitful discussion s with all stakeholders (e.g. inviting charities and private not-for-profit funders to major discussion tables on research initiatives) and better scoping of experts in drafting programs calls. We find the points emerged from the interview particularly interesting however we wish to hi ghlight some limitations with this part of the analysis. First and foremost, there was not any representative of public national or supranational RFOs in our informants' sample. This means the views we have captured are mainly from PIs and funders from t he charities and private not -for-profit organizations and may not be transferable to other sponsors. Second, we sought to interview more experts from the list of initially identified RFOs or stakeholders active in diabetes research. We managed to get 40% of the initially expected interviews. Although a level of saturation was seen on many of the topics emerged from our final pool of interviews, it could be that additional themes were underrepresented in the available set of data. Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 100 4 Bibliometrics: Impa ct of Diabetes Research Funding A key aim of MAPPING_NCD s is to establish the impact of funding investments across five key NCD areas: cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, cancer and mental health . In this aim , MAPPING_NCD moves beyond the state of the art in the research area by pursuing a bibliometric exercise of research outputs in the EU and MSs relevant to these disease areas. The bibliometric tool assesses the impact of funding investments by mapping and analyzi ng of the volume , citations, funding sources, influence on clinical guidelines and newspaper stories of research papers and reviews in the Web of Science (WoS) published in EU MSs during the period 2002 -2013 . In this analysis, the production of scientific publi cations funded in the disease are and their five -year citation counts in other papers are considered. The bibliometric analysis has also consider ed the extent to which scientific papers have been used as the eviden ce base for clinical guidelines, as well as their impact on government policy documents and appearance in media- stories . Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 101 4.1 What is Research Impact? Measuring the impact of research is a complex task. Often, health improvements depend on a host of different research discoveries, which are made at different times and in different places . The pathway from the conduct and publication of research to better health is usually indirect. In addition, the results of research contribute to better health in different ways, from the improved diagnosi s and treatment of patients to the prevention of illness or the reduction incidence. Figure 76 details the manifold linkages between research funding and health impacts. Figure 76 Some of the links between research and healthcare improvement Among these many nodes and linkages, 'government policy' occupies a central position and has a several linkages to other nodes. Moreover, the 'reduction of illness incidence' also depends on a large number of inputs, including: environmental pollution, individual health behaviours, wealth, education and the effectiveness of public health campaigns. Thus, it can be observed that r esearch impacts upon all these nodes , many of which are not specific to individual disease areas. Similarly, different types of research can also deliver advances in individual disease areas. And for these reasons, the norms for measur ing both the effecti veness of research and its quality can also differ. Nevertheless, all of the se nodes are inter -connected. A nd at connection points, hard evidence of research impact necessarily accumulates. The evidence of research impact manifests itself in the paper tr ails that flow between one node and another. For example, research funding produces research, which produces papers in scientific journals, which in turn lead to citations in other journals, decision making influence, policy , media stories and even the al location of additional research grants. Tracking and analyzing these paper trails, using them as a proxy for research impact, is the fundamental business of bibliometic research. Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 102 In this section of the paper, the bibliometric methodology is used to analyze data relevant for diabetes research at five of these: scientific research papers , funding sources (d ecisions on fu nding) , citations , the evide nce base of clinical guidelines, t he stories in newspapers and the research papers that they cite. Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 103 4.2 Scientific Research Papers: Diabetes The first means by which b ibliometric analysis establish es funding impacts is the analysis of the number of published scientific papers . This section of the report details the number of papers on diabetes downloaded from the Web of Science (WoS), considering 31 European countries (the 28 EU MSs and Iceland, Norway and Switzerland), during the timeframe 2002- 13. To this end, the bibliometric tool utilizes two overlapping databases, the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI) and the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), for the provision of knowledge on socio -economic impact and behavioral interventions associated with diabetes . A filter to conduct the marking of relevant papers in diabetes research was designed. The fi lter used to retrieve publications on diabetes consisted in a set of specialist diabetes journals and a set of title words, but with a \"no\" statement to exclude papers with cancer or carcinoma in their title unless they also contained diabet* . The original filter was developed in consultation with Dr Moira Murphy and Dr Jayne East of the British Diabetic Association (now Diabetes UK). It was updated to take into account of journals now included in the WoS and to reflect the definition of the subject provi ded in agreement between KCL and UB, which was as follows: Research into causation, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of diabetes mellitus and its long- term consequences. Diabetes mellitus (in particular Type I and Type II ) is a metabolic disorder of multiple aetiology characterized by chronic hyperglycaemia with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. The effects of diabetes mellitus include long- term damage, dysfunction and failure of various organs The filter had precision, p = 0.900 and recall, r = 0.976. Details for the filter were written to an Excel spreadsheet for analysis. The main results were organized by country outputs, research levels (from clinical to basic) and type of research or type of disease. Each filter was applied to the Web of Science for the Science Citation Index (extended) (SCI) and for the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI ) during the considered timeframe. Only published articles and r eviews were identified. The papers included also had to refer to at least one address belonging to the EU 31 geographic area .

These were then processed by a special macro to produce one combined Excel spreadsheet. Each paper in the combined sheet was given an individual index number, and the following parameters were recorded: Names of all authors, in the format SMITH -AB Paper title Source (journal name, year, volume, issue, pages) Journal name Document type (article or review) Addresses (all in upper case, separated by a forward slash). Note: in the WoS UK papers are attributed separately to ENGLAND, WALES, SCOTLAND or NORTH -IRELAND. Country of publication Year of publication Month of publication (for most p apers where the date of the journal was given) Language (almost all were in English) E-mail address (es) of corresponding author, sometimes others Funders, FU (for late 2008 papers and subsequently) Funding acknowledgement text, FX Composite list of author s and their individual addresses (from 2008) Authors' full names (where given), in the format Wilhelm, Hans; Wanke, Isabel; Hirche, Herbert (this allows the sex of most of the authors to be determined) Whether in the SCI or SSCI only Although most papers i n the WoS have their keywords of reference and formal abstracts, these were not recorded in the main spreadsheet as they would have made it far too cumbersome. Based on the publication title, a macro was applied to determine whether the paper could be classified as \"clinical \" , \"basic\" or \"both\", depending on the presence of one or more words of the two lists ( Lewison and Paraje, 2004). The research focus of the journal where the paper was published was also determined from a master list: clinical journa ls were classed as RL = 1, basic ones as RL = 4, and the ones in between were given an RL value between 1.0 and 4.0. These RL values were determined for groups of five years, 2000 -04, 2005- 09 and 2010- 14. The world and European outputs, year by year, of d iabetes research papers are given below.

The results for the individual European countries are shown in Tabl e 7. Figure 77 shows that certain countries, such as Denmark, Sweden and Finland are publishing more than expected . On the other hand, Romania and Norway are publishing only half as much as their wealth would suggest.

The data range from 4.6% for Cyprus to 1.2% for the UK. Despite having the lowest percentage disease burden for this pathology , the UK publishes substantially more papers than would be ex pected , more than many EU countries . The Mediterranean and S outhern European countries appear to suffer from this disease relatively the most, with the notable exception of Greece.

However, its DALY percentage is lower than the trend -line would suggest, and this could possibly be the result of a large investment in research. This however is just a partial explanation that could apply to Romania for instance, which also has a lower DALY percentage but it also conducts less research than expected . To explore specific subject areas within diabetes, assistance from Diabetes UK, the leading specialist medical research charity in this subject area, was sought (particularly Dr Richard Elliott, their Director of Communications, and his colleague Dr Anna Morris ). Fourteen subject areas were defined , Type I and Type II ; four other types; and eight \"complications\" caused by diabetes.

Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 111 4.3 Funding Sources Funding is now recognized as an important source of information for the evaluation of research (Lewison & Dawson, 1998; 2001; Roe et al., 2010; Rigby, 2013). At its simplest, the acknowledgement of a funding source on a paper indicates that an agency, usually an external one, has reviewed the research project and judged it worthy of support. Multiple funding sour ces would indi cate that the project has met the interest of several stakeholders . In the past, recording of funding sources for each paper was a labour- intensive task as each paper needed to be inspected individually. It was, however, worthwhile if the work could provide many different funding bodies with a tally of papers that they had supported. This was the principle behind the cr eation of the Wellcome Trust's Research Outputs Database (Jeschin et al, 1995; Dawson et al., 1998; Webster, 2005). The database covered all UK biomedical papers over a the period 1988- 2001, and was based on the papers in the Science Citation Index on CD -ROM, which was purchased from the Institute for Scientific Information in Philadelphia (now Thomson Reuters) and operated under license from them. The data were made available to members of the \"ROD club\", who paid a graduated annual fee and in return rec eived a list of their papers, together with access to consultancy advice. Since the introduction of the Science Citation Index , the facilities available for searching and for retrieving data have been steadily enhanced. During 2008, Thomson Reuters started to provide details of funding for individual papers - quite likely stimulated by the earlier existence of the ROD . There are two individually searchable fields, FO = funding organization and FT = funding text. The FO field lists the names of the acknowledged funders and FT provides the full text of the acknowledgement, including recognition of individuals who have helped with the research. For some funding bodies, the FO field also lists the grant numbers, although they are often missing (for this reas on they have not b een considered in this analysis). Authors of papers record their funding acknowledgements in a wide variety of ways. Many papers have multiple funding acknowledgements 23. In order to determine the funding sources for diabetes and the fo ur other disease areas, it was decided to use a coding system made of four parts: a trigraph (three character) code designating the individual funding body; a single letter code showing the form of support (no longer used); a digraph (two character) code designating the sector and sub -sector of the funder; and another digraph showing the country of the funder based on the ISO codes. It also became apparent that some papers did not carry an acknowledgement because they had been supported internally - in a government lab (such as one supported by a research council or Government depar tment), by a collecting charity or a commercial company. The decision was made to include these \"implicit\" acknowledgements along with the \"explicit\" ones in the 23 There are also acknowledgements to individuals who have provided help or advice. These are not considered further in this report. Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 112 acknowledgeme nt paragraph to form a composite acknowledgement24. Several papers (especially ones describing clinical work) do not report any formal acknowledgement. Probably , their authors are academics or medical personnel working in a hospital or clinic, supported b y general u niversity funds or by their own salaries from the health service. In this case however, research projects would have not been reviewed by external funders, which could perhaps lead to lower quality standards . For these reasons , it did not seem appropriate to record this type support, and the ROD was set up to re cord such papers as \"unfunded\" . Only where a specific acknowledgement made to a university /department /hospital appeared it has been presumed the presence of some system of grants. In this cases, the contribution of the employing organisation was recorded with a code. This gave rise to three sub -sectors of the private -non-profit sector, namely HT = hospital trustees, MI = academic25 and NP = other non -profit. The other two were CH = collecting charity and FO = endowed foundation. The basic principle of the methodology used to extract funding information for papers whose details were downloaded from the Web of Science (WoS) was to as sign a three -part code to each funding body, with a three -letter code to identify it uniquely, a two -character code to identify the sector and sub-sector, and another two -character code to identify the ISO designation. Codes were assigned to each funding body listed in the FO = funding organisation section of the WoS, subject to redaction if they were mentioned in a conflict of interest statement only as having paid for unrelated work. Codes were also assigned where there was an acknowledgement implicit from one (or more) of the addresses - a government department or agency, the laboratory of a collecting charity, or of an industrial company. Once codes were assigned to each funding body, they were collected and written to two thesauruses for future use. The spreadsheet of papers was then completed with the explicit and implicit codes by means of a special macro, which also combined the codes into a single column. Another macro determined the division of funders by main sector for each European country (o wn government including local and regional authorities; own private -non-profit (PNP), industry, international, and other). These were doubly fractionated: to allow for the fractional presence of the target country on each paper, and to allow for the total number of funders on a paper. The commercial sector was divided up into five sub -sectors, with companies divided into three groups: pharmaceutical, biotech and industrial. The first and third of these were further divided into independent and subsidiary. The purpose was to distinguish between the research activities of national subsidiaries of large multi- national companies which might be relatively independent of the parent, e.g., the Merck Neuroscience Park in Harlow, which did its own research and als o gave funding to universities. However there were many takeovers of small biotech (and not so small pharma) companies and it seemed appropriate to regard the takeover as a way in which the new parent company would thereby gain the intellectual property o f the new acquisition. This meant that many of the commercial codes became out- of-date. This had two consequences for the analysis of funding sources. First, the country of a company was effectively undefined, and second, the sub - 24 Several of the ROD members maintained their own labs and also gave external researc h grants and this system allowed them to compare their respective outputs. 25 This term was used because many universities and colleges are both endowed with capital and are still collecting money ( e.g., from their alumni). Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 113 sector could change whe n a biotech company had brought a new drug to market and had so become a pharma company. The public sector was divided into three sub -sectors: government department (controlled by ministers), government agency (nominally independent of ministerial directiv es) and local authorities (including regions, counties and cities). They were given sectoral codes: GD, GA and LA, respectively. Although the latter form of support hardly exists in the UK, it is becoming increasingly common in several continental Europe an countries (L\u00e4nder in Germany, r\u00e9gions in France, provinces in Spain) and also in N orth America (provinces in Canada and states in the USA) and in Australia (states and territories). Most of these regions have been given their own trigraphs, although so me smaller regions have generic codes, see below. Because of international collaboration on biomedical research papers, many papers also had foreign partners and acknowledgements to foreign funding sources. The thesaurus soon began to run out of trigraph codes, and we started to use \"generic\" codes for the smaller organisations (in terms of their biomedical research spend). These consisted of a single letter (X, Y or Z) followed by one digit (to designate the country) and another to designate the sector a nd sub -sector. Individual countries that supported a lot of biomedical research were given their own digraph (e.g, X1 = USA); others were given one that showed their continent. There is, of course, some redundancy as the country and sector/sub -sector are also given by the second and third digraphs, but these are needed for the main analyses. For example, X1B- BT-US indicates a US biotechnology company in two ways. Generic codes for the UK were not used initially, but have been introduced to cater for the large number of new British funding bodies, and codes UK1, UK2 etc. are employed.

These trigraphs, and the associated sectoral and country codes, were assembled into a large thesaurus of funding bodies. The thesaurus is structured so that the different names and formats given to a funding body (and in some cases its dependent agencies, bodies or companies) are all listed to facilitate the allocation of codes. At the time of writing, there were 1 7,485 entries and 10,045 (out of a possible 17,576) individual letter trigraphs. This suggests that there is still plenty of opportunity for new codes, but it is often difficult to find appropriate letter combinations for new organizations with many funde d papers. These are appearing in continental European countries as work on the project develops, because the thesaurus was originally developed mainly for UK funding bodies. Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 115 4.4 Diabetes : Funding Sources The analysis of diabetes included 40,547 papers, of which 20, 015 were published durin g the last five years, 2009 -13. Of these, 1 ,161 (5.8% ) had a conflict of interest statement, and needed to be examined individually in order to check the funding bodies listed in the FU column of the spreadsheet , and redact them if necessary. Some papers originally crediting funding bodies were found not to be funded explicitly, and others displayed sharply reduced numbers ; a very few resulted to have additional funders. After the redaction, 13,718 papers had o ne or more funders (69%) and the remaining 31% had none. Figure 81 shows the percentages of papers with given numbers of funders or more. Figure 81 Cumulative percentage of numbers of DIABE papers with different numbers of funders, 2009- 13 The analysis on the mean number of funders showed considerable variation among countries , with Scandinavian countries exhibiting the highest values, while Poland and Greece had lower averages (Figure 82).

The analysis by main sector of reference, using fractional counts of sectors for each paper and fractional country counts, is shown in Figure 83. This chart reveals that the Scandinavian countries have more private -non-profit sources, especially endowed foundations. Rather few of their DIABE papers do not report a funding acknowledgement, explicit or implicit. Czech Republic, France and Spain are notable for the high percentage of their papers explicitly fu nded by the public sector. This percentage is very low in Greece and Austria, where many papers are \"unfunded\", i.e. supported by higher education funds or the national health service. For most countries the percentage of internationally -funded papers is quite low and mainly refers to funding from the EU. Such proportion is considerable for Latvia (63% on a fractional count basis) and Estonia (37%). The major countries in terms of DIABE research are also the major recipients of EU financial support: UK 200 papers on a fractional count basis with CEC funding, ES 149 papers, DE 143 papers, FR 118 papers and IT 108 papers, although the percentages are below 10%.

Figure 84 Mean number of funders per paper (F) and mean research level (RL) on a scale from 1 = clinical to 4 = basic research for all DIABE papers in 14 subject areas, 2009 -13 Overall, papers in clinical journals tend to give fewer funding acknowledgements than ones in basic journals. This also holds true for papers with clinical title words compared with ones containing basic title words, see Table 12. Table 12 Numbers of funding bodies per paper for DIABE papers, 2009 -13, in journals of different RL (RL 1 is clinical; RL4 is basic) and containing clinical and/or basic title words RL (J) F N F = 0 % fund Title words F N F = 0 % fund 1.0 to 1.5 1.91 6895 2871 58.4 Clinical not basic 2.14 3.28 2510 503 80.0 3.0 3.86 1780 288 83.8 All basic 3.58 4643 789 83.0 3.0 to 3 .5 3.34 1057 176 83.3 Basic not clinical 3.94 2133 286 86.6 3.5 to 4 .0 4.35 541 44 91.7 N = total number of papers in each group; F = 0 is number with no funding acknowledgements. It is not surprising that the average number of funders per paper rises with the number of authors , as the additional authors may be expected to be able to tap extra funding sources, and papers with many authors are likely to have an international team and attract fu nding from different countries.

The latter table confirms that the JDRF concentrates, as it states in its mission statement, on type I diabetes ( although 12% of its papers were on type II), and that Novo Nordisk, along with the UK Department of Health, the Wellcome Trust and Diabetes UK, also relatively prioritize type I diabetes over other areas but support more papers on the study of type II than type I diabetes .

The values of paper and journal RL are shown in chart form in Figure 86. The neonatal diabetes and MODY papers were more basic than the mean for papers in the journals in which they were published, but in all the other subject areas except liver complications the papers were more clinical than the average for their journals.

However, the mere presence of such guidelines is no guarantee that they will be effective at improving healthcare (Schrader et al., 2006). The first study, on a small scale, examined the cited papers on a sample of 15 UK clinical guid elines (Grant et al., 2000). It found that they were very clinical and that UK research was over- cited by 2.5 times. A subsequent study of 43 cancer clinical guidelines in the UK (Lewison et al., 2008) reached similar conclusions, and showed that they co uld also be used as a means to evaluate research in other countries, for example six Swedish universities. This work was subsequently updated (Pallari and Lewison, 2014) and showed that surgery featured strongly among the cited references (over 25% of the total). It also showed a big variation in whether a country's papers were over- or under -cited relative to its presence in cancer research. Thus UK research was over -cited by almost four, Danish, Dutch and Swedish research by more than two, but that fro m the \"accession\" States (Poland, Czech Republic and Romania) by half or less. We investigated the clinical guidelines currently available in the different European States in order to extend the work to other countries. Although many countries had a set o f national guidelines, some had regional ones as well, and there were yet others published by European societies of professionals in various branches of medicine. We even learned that in Sweden, each of the 21 counties had their own clinical guidelines. Clearly, it would have been impossible for us to collect the references on all of these, and so we decided to limit the study to national guidelines. In the earlier studies on UK guidelines, the identification of the references with papers processed for the Web of Science involved much labour as each one had to be sought individually. It would not have been practical in the scope of this project to continue in this way for guidelines for the other NCDs and for all the other European countries, but we were able to semi- automate the process by means of a visual basic macro, written by Dr Philip Roe of Evaluametrics Ltd. This worked as follows : first, the references section of a guideline in PDF format were copied and pasted to an Excel spreadsheet ; second, these were slightly tidied by removal of page numbers, document running heads, etc ; and thirdly, t he macro was then operated, and it generated sets of search statements, eight at a time, ready for copying and pasting into the search panel of the WoS. An e xample is given below: ((AU=(Anderson AND Pottier AND SO=(T*) AND PY=1992) OR (AU=(Heaney AND Conway AND Kelly AND Johnston AND English AND Stevenson) AND TI=Predictors AND SO=(T*) AND PY=2003) OR (AU=(Martin AND McLennan AN D Landau AND Phelan) AND TI=childhood AND SO=(B*) AND PY=1980) OR (AU=Roorda,R AND SO=(E*) AND PY=2005) OR (AU=(Dundas AND Chan AND Bridge AND McKenzie) AND TI=bronchodilator AND SO=(T*) AND PY=2005) ) Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 125 The limit of eight individual papers was set so as to keep within the limits for the number of terms allowed by the WoS. Author names (AU) up to six in number were given without initials as sometimes they were given incorrectly by the guideline although if there was only one author the first initial was given. [In the WoS, Jones or Jones,A will find papers by Jones, AT but Jones,PR will NOT find papers by Jones, PRT.] The title word (TI) was selected to be the longest in the pa per title. The journal name (source, SO) was given by just its initial letter as the guidelines usually gave an abbreviated name and this would have needed to be substituted by its full name, which would have had to be researched and entered into the macr o. Finally, the publication year (PY) was given for completeness. This process worked well, and even though the search statements needed to be inspected individually (to remove author names with non -Roman characters which are not recognized by the WoS and to delete any punctuation marks attached to title words), it was possible to identify and download over 860 references from one guideline in about 3 1/2 hours. The macro also listed references that did not satisfy its specific requirements so that any errors could be corrected manually and the macro then run again. The results of this element for DIABE will be reported in the Bibliometrics Work Package of Mapping NCDS. Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 126 4.7 Newspaper Stories There is abundant evidence that politicians are unduly sensitive to stories in the media. Some of these are based on individual cases, in which it is reported that named patients do not have access to particular means of therapy (expensive drugs, for exam ple). Ministers react by making special provision for them, but this can distort the overall health -care system as with the Cancer Drugs Fund in the UK (Thornton, 2011; Knapton, 2014). Senior officials can use the stories to bring news of research to their ministers; most will not have the time to read the literature extensively and need help to learn about interesting developments. The same is true for health -care administrators in hospitals and clinics, who may learn about new methods of health -care de livery that offer potential cost savings. Medical personnel will also benefit, though the media can also provide misinformation that can cause doctors to misdiagnose (Schmidt et al. , 2014). They can also influence researchers, and there is evidence that media coverage increases modestly the numbers of citations (Phillips et al., 1991; Lewison et al ., 2008). The print media may even be a source in their own right (Hicks & Wang, 2013). The biggest influence may be on ordinary people, and could assist the public to choose healthier life styles (Nishtar et al ., (Olufowote, 2011; Robbins, Pang & Leask, 2012), although sensational press coverage of supposed links between MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccination and autism has had a negative effect (Holton et al ., 2012). They may also add to the political pressure for public investment in medical research, particularly if own -country papers are well- cited. In som e countries, commentators on the significance of the research often come from medical research charities, which thereby gain exposure (Lewison et al., 2012). Print newspapers are in decline in many countries, but many have a strong web presence and are st ill important despite the growing influence of social websites such as Twitter and Facebook. This part of the project was intended to show the effects of European NCD research on six groups of people: politicians and other decision -makers; senior officials and advisers; health -care administrators; medical personnel (doctors, other professionals); researchers; the general public. It embarked on an ambitious programme of study on the coverage of research in the five NCDs during the 12 -year period, 2002- 13, in a large number of European newspapers. Some of these have their own searchable websites; others can be searched through full- text databases such as Factiva \u00a9Dow Jones, to which KCL subscribes. The results of this element of the project span the five NC D disease areas. For this reason, they will be reported in the Bibliometrics Work Package of Mapping NCDS. Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 127 4.8 Conclusion The Bibliometric tool provides a methodology to assess the impact of research funding in the fi eld of diabetes in terms of production of scientific publications, as well as level of influence via citation analysis . It has allowed the identification of specific peculiarities related to volume, geography and type of funding institutions . The volume o f diabetes research as a proportion of biomedical scientific production has increased over the years, both on a global scale and at European level, although our continent has seen a decline in relative terms to the rest of the world when considering outputs of diabetes research papers (Europe accounted for 43.9% of world total in 2002 with 2.368 papers and for 35.7% in 2013 with 4.404 articles). There is however heterogeneity across States, with most Scandinavian countries (Denmark, Sweden and Finland) ex hibiting higher scientific production than expected. Instead countries like Norway and Romania are producing less publications than their GDP would suggest. When looking at the burden of disease in different countries (in terms of D ALYs) , Mediterranean and Southern European countries (except Greece) appear to suffer more from diabetes . The link between the burden and overall production of articles is still to be further explored: countries such as the UK are less affected by the disease in terms of pre valence and DALYs but still publish a considerable number of papers (DALYs are actually lower than what the prevalence would suggest, possibly due to large investments in research). In terms of type of r esearch, the analysis shows that a rticles tend to be published mostly in clinical journals, as research levels are equal to 1.70 (RL=1 for clinical journals, RL=4 for basic journals). There is a tendency for the northern European countries, especially Estonia and Finland, to devote relatively more attentio n to Type I diabetes, while the contrary holds true for Southern Europe. The Scandinavian countries (Denmark being an exception) under -research the issue of complications. With respect to RFOs, papers in clinical journals tend to give fewer funding ackn owledgements than ones in basic journals . There is a striking difference between Type II and Type I diabetes papers: the former are much more numerous and are 66% more cited, on average. The most cited diabetes subject areas receive more cites in the fiv e years following publication than any other sub -field or research type in the other four NCDs . The analysis of the mean number of funders shows heterogeneity among states, with Scandinavian countries displaying higher averages per paper (7 for Finland, around 5.5 FOR Sweden and around 4.5 for Denmark), while in Poland and Greece there are less than 2 funders per paper. In terms of the mix of funding institutions, Scandinavian countries have more private -non-profit sources, especially endowed foundations. Rather few of their DIABE papers do not report a funding acknowledgement, explicit or implicit. Czech Republic, France and Spain are notable for the high percentage of their papers explicitly funded by the public sector. This percentage is very low in Greece and Austria, where many papers are \"unfunded \". For most countries the percentage of internationally -funded papers is quite low and mainl y refers to funding from the EU. The European Union is the largest single source of support in terms of the num bers of papers funded, with the second largest being the Danish company Novo Nordisk A/S. The remaining are mainly government Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 128 agencies, with the exception of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, the Wellcome Trust and Diabetes UK. Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 129 5 Conclusion According to various and credited source , diabetes ranks in the top 10 causes of disability worldwide with more than 4.5 million annual deaths. After the UN High- Level Summit on Non -communicable Diseases (NCDs) in 2011, diabetes, together with the other N CDs, registered an increase in importance in the health agenda (IDF, 2011) . Consequently, policy makers and other stakeholders started to become more aware of the fact that investing in diabetes prevention and care can improve the quality of life of people affected, hinder diabetes -relat ed complications and save lives . In this report, t he analysis of European research projects has highlighted areas of research where action has been taken to foster knowledge creation and sharing through funding of relevant projects. Diabetes Type I and Type II as classified by ICD -10 are a major focus of funding, which is mirrored by the resul t of the bibliometric analysis . Among the complications, cardiovascular complications are the most commonly studied in the projects funded by the European programmes, as well as other national and international RFOs. Their scientific production is also considerable (14.1% of total DIABE papers). It emerges that major projects tend to focus less on the study of patient -disease managem ent, as well as on the analysis of policies related to diabetes prevention and treatment. A particularly crucial issue in this respect c oncerns the promotion of effective engagement with the general public to raise awareness on prevention of type II diabetes . Another area where investments are needed is the study of systems to share biological samples through bio - banks , registry data and research findings across Europe . This theme is also recur rent in the stakeholders interview data. Over the period 2011 -2014, the European pharmaceutical sector has generally increased its R&D expenditures, however with few exceptions . The most substantial increase was registered by smaller pharmaceutical companies. In terms of R&D intensity (a measure that allows t o capture the relative importance of R&D among firms in the same industry), current findings suggest that US pharmaceutical companies generally allocate more resources in research an d development activities than European firms. However, w hen focusing spec ifically on research pipelines for diabetes, US companies loose their role of leaders, with 26 molecules under development compared to 40 for EUR firms . The se are mainly aimed at treating type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, with a minority dedicated to d iabetes complications . Over the period 2011 -2014, the medical device sector commitment to R&D investments has been highly heterogeneous . As regards R&D intensity, US firms generally record higher levels of R&D ratio on sales than E uropean companies, meaning that US medical devices companies allocate more resources in research and development activities than EU R firms. Diabetes medical devices cons ist of a wide range of products: from insulin pumps to blood glucose meters and infusion sets . Despite being one of the top 10 causes of disability worldwide , few companies in the sector have developed any diabetes relevant medical devices in recent years. The themes emerged from the stakeholders interviews were organized in six major areas: i) challenges in diabetes research, ii) duplication in diabetes research, iii) research gaps, iv) impact of research and priority -setting, v) partnerships and vi) the role of the EU. According to the informants, the challenges faced by researchers and RFOs in diabetes research are financial and organizational. Critical Appraisal Report DIABE - UB 130 Heterogeneity of funding bodies was perceived to be an opportunity to preserve and develop through structured forms of cooperation. A general broader view on the impact of research as impact on diagnos tic and therapeutic practice, patient outcomes and health services was supported. In terms of research gaps or unmet need, informants pointed out the broad area of aetiology (i.e. pathogenesis of hypo/hyperglycaemic events, pathogenesis of chronic complic ations), prevention (i.e. genetic factors linked to the adult development of T2DM) or treatment (i.e. adjunct therapies, artificial pancreas, beta- cell transplantation, cell line conversion). Many of these topics were also emerging through the bibliometri c and research programs analysis. Similarly, bio -banks development was the most recommended suggestion to speed up genetic -based studies. Another probably unexpected topic suggested for future research was on the social and health related quality of life aspects of people living with the disease, how it is possible to make patients and families more engaged with the treatment and how to get them to use the treatment much more effectively . Finally, and in addition to what can be captured through other met hodologies, the role attributed to the EU is one of coordination and leadership , with r ecommendations on fruitful engagement in discussion with all stakeholders or wider net casts to involve experts in drafting programs calls. The Bibliometric analysis provides a quantitative methodology to assess the impact of research funding in the fi eld of diabetes in terms of production of scientific publications, as well as level of influence via citation analysis . It has allowed the identification of specific pec uliarities related to volume, geography and type of funding institutions . Overall, the volume of diabetes research as a proportion of biomedical scientific production has increased over the years, with geographic heterogeneity across countries in terms of GDP - productivity link. When looking at the burden of disease, countries such as the UK publish more than what prevalence and DALYs of the disease would suggest. There is a tendency for the N orthern European count ries to devote relatively more attention to Type I diabetes, while the contrary holds true for Southern Europe. Type II diabetes papers are much more numerous and 66% more cited, on average , than Type I diabetes papers . Scandinavian countries display higher number of funders per paper and more private -non-profit sources, especially endowed foundations. For most countries the percentage of internationally - funded papers is quite low and mainly refers to funding from the EU. The European Union is the largest single source of support in terms of the numbers of papers funded, with the second largest being the Danish company Novo Nordisk A/S. There are numerous discussion points that start to surface by the combined considerations of findings from different analyse s in this report. In the next a nd final evidence synthesis deliverable, we will illustrate the triangulation of the various outputs from the MAPPING_NCD within each disease categories to contrast, reinforce or discuss emerging directives to guide the future research funding strategies a cross NCD s in Europe.
