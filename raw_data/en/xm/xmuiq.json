Those situations resulting from accidents heart attack stroke ruptured appendix and emergency issues arising in pregnancy organ transplantations and chemical analysis of poisons and the like are obvious examples where technology centered therapies of the west are vital. Advantages of Siddha Medicine System: The unparalleled benefits that siddha medicine offers are mainly in its preventive measures, which begin even before the birth, and its ability to holistically and naturally address ailments that arise throughout life in terms of complete cure. Siddha medicine treats the whole person. Indeed, with all respect to western medical efforts and advancements, today disillusioned by the symptomatic treatment provided by allopathic medicines, more and more people are turning to alternative therapies for complete cure of chronic ailments. Siddha medicine revitalizes and rejuvenates the organs, the dysfunction of which is causing the disease and thus proves to be a good alternative. The problem of super bugs is not present in siddha medicine. Disadvantages of Western Medicine System: It's a known fact that western allopathic medicine carries lots of side-effects. They can range from mild side effects like fatigue, constipation to other side effects like hair loss, rise in blood pressure, damage to liver, adverse drug reactions (ADR), iatrogenic diseases etc. \"Super bugs\" or \"multidrug-resistant bacteria\" is one of the major problem to mankind arising due to indiscriminate use of antibiotics. Also, the mindset that the people develop in the present culture is that \"every ill has to have a pill or surgical manipulation to put things back into shape\". This is the bane of modern western medicine. "}
