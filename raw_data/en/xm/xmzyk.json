One such \"tradition\" involves using unconventional means-including mental healing, herbal formulas, and healing hand therapies such as acupuncture-to treat chronic illnesses. Although mental healing is unproven and energy therapy is not completely understood, acupuncture, herbal therapy, and sublingual immunotherapy have been described more extensively with mixed results that lack consistency and high-quality scientific data. Researchers are working to modernize these traditional therapies in the treatment of allergic disorders and using advanced technology to alter what some call \"the earth's natural healing power\" in hopes of developing a new, integrative form of medicine.
