It includes both general data collection conventions and item -specific guidance, as well as links to resources for agencies . Since OASIS collection was implemented in 1999, national interest in the area of home health care quality measurement and improvement has been ongoing. CMS received hundreds of comments about OASIS from a variety of sources: providers, professional organizations (e.g., American Nurses Association and the American Physical Therapy Association), home care provider organizations, accrediting organizations, researchers, etc. In addition, individuals and groups with expertise in health care quality measurement, such as the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), the National Quality Forum (NQF), and many technical expert panels comm issioned by CMS to guide OASIS evolution have offered suggestions for improving OASIS and expanding the domains of home health quality measurement to address the six aims (safety, timeliness, effectiveness, efficiency, equity, and patient -centeredness) articulated by the Institute of Medicine in their 2001 report \"Crossing the Quality Chasm. \" Input from the NQF, a nonprofit organization that endorses national consensus standards for measuring and publicly reporting on performance has been especially valuabl e in guiding the evolution of OASIS and associated performance reports. NQF -endorsed voluntary consensus standards are widely viewed as the gold standard for measurement of health care quality. NQF has endorsed a number of OASIS -based quality measures for public reporting. Endorsed measures are periodically reviewed for continuing endorsement, and, as measure development continues, new or revised measures are submitted to NQF for review. INTRODUCTION The Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) is a group of standard data elements developed, tested, and refined over the course of two decades through a research and demonstration program funded primarily by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), with additional funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the New York State Department of Health. OASIS data elements were designed to enable systematic comparative measurement of home health care patient outcomes at two points in time. OASIS-based quality measures can be used for quality improvement efforts that home health agencies (HHAs) can employ to assess and improve the quality of care they provide to patients. CMS provides HHA s with numerous quality measure reports including outcome, process , potentially avoidable event, patient -related characteristic, and patient tally reports. Reports are provided for up to two time intervals selected by the HHA requesting the reports. Process quality measures include indicators of how often the HHA follows best practices to improve patient outcomes. Outcome measures include end-result functional and physical health improvement/stabilization, health care utilization measures , and potentially avoidable events. Potentially avoidable events are negative outcomes that clinical evidence indicates can be influenced (although not necessarily totally avoided) by following best practices in providing care. In addition to quality measurement, certain OASIS data elements are used to adjust per -episode payment rates for patient conditions that affect care needs. REVISION HISTORY 1. OASIS C Guidance Manual Original Publication: September 2009 2. Revision 1: December 2009 3. Revision 2: January 2011 4. Revision 3: January 2012 OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 1 OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chapter 1-2 5. Revision 4: December 2012 6. OASIS-C1/ICD-9 Guidance Manual: June 2014 N ote: Past revisions of the guidance manual have included an \"errata\" document that indicated where changes had occurred so that HHAs could replace only those manual pages that had changed. Because this revision is substantially more extensive than previous updates, this manual was intended to replace in its entirety the OASIS -C Guidance Manual and as such, changes to specific sections or pages were not tracked. However, there was a table included at the beginning of Chapter 3 that indicated which OASIS items and which item -by-item guidance sections had been revised. 7. OASIS-C1/ICD-9 Guidance Manual: January 2015 C hanges in this version included a new Chapter 2, in which the \"draft \" notation was removed from the OASIS forms and the OMB number was added to each time point version. The footer date throughout the entire manual was changed to January 2015 . 8. OASIS-C1/ICD-10 Guidance Manual: October 2015 T his version of the manual included changes required to incorporate the newly -implemented ICD -10-CM codes into both the guidance manual and the corresponding OASIS -C1 data set items. The footer was changed in all chapters, including those that did not have changes related to the implementation of ICD -10- CM. 9. OASIS-C2 Guidance Manual: Effective January 1, 2017 T his version of the manual replaces the previous version in its entirety. This version includes changes required for standardization with other post -acute care data sets. Three new standardized items and guidance, and five revised items and guidance are in cluded in this version. Other changes include guidance for a revised look -back period for five items, and clarifications in response to questions submitted to the OASIS Help Desk. 10. OASIS-C2 Guidance Manual: Effective January 1, 2018 T his version of the man ual replaces the previous version in its entirety. This version includes corrections and updates, including but not limited to errors listed in the September OASIS -C2 Guidance Manual Errata, and new guidance made available in October 2016 and February 2017 CMS National Provider Training Q&A documents. 11. OASIS D Guidance Manual: Effective January 1, 2019 T his version of the manual introduces new and modified items. Some are standardized patient assessment data elements (SPADEs), added to meet the requirement s of the Improving Medicare Post -Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (IMPACT Act) . Standardized guidance for the new items is included. The manual also includes revisions to correct, update or clarify guidance. (See Appendix G for a summary of changes fr om OASIS-C2 to OASIS-D). MANUAL OVERVIEW Chapter 1 - The Introduction, which provides contextual information and other general information relevant to OASIS data collection. Chapter 2 - Includes versions of the OASIS data set for each data collection time point. Chapter 3 - Contains item -specific guidance, subdivided into sections. Chapter 4 - Illustrative Examples are retired . Page intentionally left blank . OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 1 OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chapter 1-3 Chapter 5 - Includes relevant resources for HHAs, with hyperlinks when available. Appendices - Include additional contextual information, including sections on OASIS and the comprehensive assessment, home health care regulations related to OASIS data collection, and recommendations for ensuring accuracy of OASIS data. WHY IS OASIS BEING REVISED NOW? HHAs began collecting and transmitting OASIS data for adult skilled Medicare and Medicaid patients (with the exception of maternity patients) in 1999. Since 1999, numerous changes have occurred within the health care system, including specific recommendat ions for changes in the area of home health care quality measurement. Currently the main reason for revising OASIS is to increase standardization across post -acute care (PAC) settings to enable calculation of standardized, cross -setting QMs , pursuant to the provisions of the IMPACT Act. Standardized patient assessment data elements (SPADEs) are questions and response options that are identical in all four PAC assessment instruments, and to which identical standards and definitions apply. WHAT 'S NEW WITH THE OASIS -D ASSESSMENT INSTRUM ENT? New items are added Different time point versions of some items Removal of items Revision of some items Updated Skip Patterns WHAT 'S NEW WITH THE OASIS- D GUIDANCE? Chapter 3, two new sections of standard guidance added: Section J - Health Conditions Section GG - Functional Abilities and Goals Chapter 4, Illustrative Examples are retired Removal of many items and their corresponding guidance Revisions to existing Guidance for some OASIS items to update or clarify information Appendix F - sample reports are not included in this version. Users may refer to the Casper Reporting User Manual, Section 6, OASIS Quality Improvement Reports, located at: ht tps://qtso.cms.gov/hhatrain.html COLLECTING OASIS DAT A This section will provide a basic overview for collecting OASIS data. For more detail on clinical strategies for collecting OASIS data as part of a comprehensive assessment, refer to Chapter 3 of this manual. ELIGIBLE PATIENTS OASIS data are collected for Medicare and Medicaid patients, 18 years and older, receiving skilled services, with the exception of patients receiving services for pre- or postnatal conditions. Those receiving only personal care, homemaker, or chor e services are excluded since these are not considered skilled services. TIME POINTS OASIS data are collected at the following time points: OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 1 OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chapter 1-4 Start of care Resumption of care following inpatient facility stay Recertification within the last five days of each 60-day recertification period Other follow -up during the home health episode of care Transfer to an inpatient facility Death at home Discharge from agency A ll of these assessments, with the exception of transfer to inpatient facility and death at home, require the clinician to have an in-person encounter with the patient during a home visit. The transfer to an inpatient facility requires collection of limited OASIS data (most of which may be obtained through a telephone call ). Not all OASIS items are completed at every assessment time point. Some items are completed only at start of care, some only at discharge. The table of \"Items to be Used at Specific Time Points \" included at the beginning of the OASIS data set allows the home health agency (or its sel ected medical record vendor) to integrate the necessary OASIS items at each time point into clinical documentation forms or an electronic health record. At the start of care time point, the comprehensive assessment should be completed within five days after the start of care date. At the resumption of care, the comprehensive assessment must be completed within 48 hours of return home after inpatient facility discharge, or within 48 hours of knowledge of a qualifying stay in an inpatient facility . A physici an- ordered resumption of care (ROC) must be conducted on or within 2 calendar days of the physician-ordered ROC date. For the transfer to inpatient facility, discharge from home care, death at home, and other follow -up, the assessments must be completed on, or within 48 hours of becoming aware of the significant change in condition, transfer, discharge, or death date. WHO COMPLETES OASIS? As identified in (M0080) Discipline of Person Completing Assessment, the comprehensive assessment and OASIS data collection are the responsibility of a registered nurse (RN) or any of the therapies, including physical therapist (PT), speech language pathologist/speech therapist (SLP/ST), or occupational therapist (OT). A licensed practical nurse or licensed vocational nurse (LPN/LVN), physical therapy assistant (PTA), occupational therapy assistant (OTA), medical social worker (MSW), or Aide may not be responsible for completing OASIS assessments. In cases involving nursing, the RN is responsible for completing the comprehensive assessment document at the SOC , and may elicit input from the patient, caregivers, and other health care personnel, including the physician, the pharmacist and/or other agency staff to assist in completion of any or all OASIS items . Any discipline q ualified to perform assessments - RN, PT, SLP, OT - may complete subsequent assessments. For a therapy -only case, the therapist usually conducts the comprehensive assessment. It is acceptable for a PT or SLP to conduct and complete the comprehensive assess ment at SOC for a Medicare patient. An OT may conduct and complete the assessment when the need for occupational therapy establishes program eligibility. Note: Occupational therapy alone does not establish eligibility for the Medicare home health benefit at the start of care; however, occupational therapy may establish eligibility under other programs, such as Medicaid. The Medicare home health patient who is receiving services from multiple disciplines (for example, skilled nursing, physical therapy, and occupational therapy) during the episode of care, can retain eligibility if, over time, occupational therapy is the only remaining skilled discipline providing care. At that time, an OT can conduct OASIS assessments. Multidisciplinary cases may have multiple points of discipline- specific discharge, though there is only one HHA discharge, which must include completion of the OASIS discharge comprehensive assessment. Other non -OASIS required documentation for recertification and discharge are specified in the Condition of Participation: OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 1 OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chapter 1-5 Comprehensive Assessment of Patients.1 OASIS items were designed to be discipline-neutral and have been tested and validated with clinicians from various disciplines. COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT AND PLAN OF CAR E OASIS data are collected as part of the comprehensive assessment required by the Medicare Conditions of Participation (see Appendix A of this manual). OASIS is not intended to represent a comprehensive assessment in and of itself. HHAs are expected to incorporate OASIS items into their comprehensive assessment documentation and follow their own assessment policies and procedures. Agencies are free to rearrange OASIS item sequence in a way that permits logical ordering within their own forms, as long as the actual item content, skip patterns, and OASIS number remain the same. Like other comprehensive assessment documentation, OASIS data are collected using a variety of strategies, including observation, interview, review of pertinent documentation when allowed (for example, hospital discharge summaries) , discussions with other healthcare providers where relevant (for example, phone calls to the physician to verify diagnoses), and measurement (for example, intensity of pain). Although one clinician must take responsibility for the comprehensive assessment, collaboration with the patient, caregivers, and other health care personnel, including the physician, pharmacist, and/or other agency staff is appropriate. For items requiring patient assessment, the collaborating healthcare providers must have had direct contact with the patient. OASIS data should be collected at each time point based on a unique patient assessment, not simply carried over from a previous assessment. Comprehensive assessment data form the basis of the physician- ordered Plan of Care. Thus, there should be congruenc e between documentation of findings from the comprehensive assessment and the Plan of Care. Agencies may have the comprehensive assessment completed by one clinician. If collaboration with other health care personnel and/or agency staff is utilized, the agency is responsible for establishing policies and practices related to collaborative efforts, including how assessment information from multiple clinicians will be documented within the clinical record, ensuring compliance with applicable requirements, and accepted standards of practice. PROCESS OF CARE DATA ITEMS Process of care data items (process items) document whether certain evidence- based practices were implemented. Process items collected at SOC/ROC document assessment such as whether the patient was assessed to be at risk for certain conditions like falls . These items refer to assessments that were completed within the five-day SOC period or the two-day ROC period. Process items collected at transfer and discharge time points include documentation of interventions implemented as part of patient care at the time of or since the most recent start of care or resumption of care. Specific instructions about review periods are included in item guidance for the relevant OASIS items . Process items collected at transfer and discharge may require a clinician to review documentation of care provided during the home health episode in order to accurately complete the items. Note that this review must consider care provided by all disciplines, and is not limited to care provided by the discipline of the clinician completing the OASIS assessment. The review can be accomplished in several different ways. The care provider may find it necessary to review clinical records, including the Plan of Care, updated orders, and visit notes. Alternatively, the agency may elect to create a flowsheet with the appropriate parameters that are checked off on each visit. Review of the flowsheet may provide the needed information, such that a review of the clinical record would be unnecessary. Another strategy for agencies using electronic health records is to create a report template that could pull the needed information from data fields incorporated into visit notes. Regardless of the technique that an agency chooses, the process data items completed at transfer and discharge will require knowledge of patient symptoms, initial and subsequent physician' s orders, and clinical interventions performed to address patient symptoms that were present at the time of or since the most recent SOC/ROC assessment. 1 http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi- bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=1c743ade23ae8533ee0732689c166e31&r=PART&n=42y5.0.1.1.3#se42.5.484 155 OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 1 OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chapter 1-6 CONVENTIONS FOR COMP LETING OASIS Listed below are conventions, or general rules, that should be observed when completing OASIS. Item -specific guidance is provided in Chapter 3. The OASIS Guidance is updated periodically to provide additional clarification based on \"Frequently Asked Questions \" sent to CMS. (A link to Frequently Asked Questions is provided in Chapter 5). It is not possible to address all of the situations that arise, due to the rare and unique nature of some of the questions, and exceptions that may be encountered in clinical practice. Each patient scenario, clinical status, social and environmental situation is unique, requiring professional/clinical judgment and care coordination. In the event you cannot resolve your understanding of the OASIS questions, CMS will continue to provide avenues to accept and respond to questions. GENERAL OASIS ITEM C ONVENTIONS 1. Understand the time period under consideration for each item. Report what is true on the day of assessment unless a different time period has been indicated in the item or related guidance. Day of assessment is defined as the 24 hours immediately preceding the home visit and the time spent by the clinic ian in the home. 2. For OASIS purposes, a quality episode must have a beginning (that is, an SOC or ROC assessment) and a conclusion (that is, a Transfer , Discharge , Death at Home assessment) to be considered a complete quality episode. 3. If the patient 's abili ty or status varies on the day of the assessment, report the patient 's \"usual status \" or what is true greater than 50% of the assessment time frame, unless the item specifies differently. 4. Minimize the use of NA and Unknown responses. 5. Some items allow a dash response. A dash ( -) value indicates that no information is available. CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. 6. Responses to items documenting a patient 's current status should be based on observation of the patient 's condition and ability at the time of the assessment without referring back to prior assessments or documentation of status from a prior care setting. Several process items require review of documentation of care that occurred at the time of or at any time since the most recent SOC or ROC OASIS assessment. These instructions are included in item guidance for the relevant OASIS items . 7. Combine observation, interview, collaboration with other agency staff and other relevant strategies to complete any and all OASIS items as needed, unless otherwise noted in guidance. F or example, it is acceptable to review the hospital discharge summary for information on a patient 's episodes of confusion, or to interview the caregiver regarding the patient 's incontinence. However, when assessing physiologic or functional health status, direct observation is the preferred strategy. 8. When an OASIS item refers to assistance, this means assistance from another person. Assistance is not limited to physical contact and can include necessary verbal cues and/or s upervision. 9. Complete OASIS items accurately and comprehensively, and adhere to skip patterns. 10. Understand the definitions of words as used in the OASIS. 11. Follow rules included in the Item Specific Guidance (Chapter 3 of this manual). 12. Stay current with evolving CMS OASIS guidance via updates to the guidance manual and posted Q&A documents . OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 1 OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chapter 1-7 13. The comprehensive assessment includes the OASIS items and is part of the patient 's legal home health agency clinical record. While only the assessing clinician is responsible for accurately completing and signing a comprehensive assessment, s/he may collaborate to collect data for all OASIS items, if agency policy allows. Collaboration may consider information from others such as the patient, caregivers, and other health care personnel, including the physician, pharmacist, and/or other agency staff who have had direct contact with the patient or had some other means of gathering information to contribute to the OASIS data collection. When collaboration is utilized, the M0090 Date assessment completed should reflect the last date the assessing clinician gathered or received any input used to complete the comprehensive assessment, including the OASIS items. When used, collaboration must occur within the appropriate timeframe and consistent with data collection guidance. Any exception to this general convention concerning collaboration is identified in item -specific guidance. 14. The use of the term \"specifically, \" means scoring of the item should be limited to only the circumstances listed. The use of \"for example, \" means the clinician may consider other relevant circumstances or attributes when scoring the item. CONVENTIONS SPECIFIC TO OASIS ADL/IADL ITEMS 1. Report the patient 's physical and cognitive ability to perform a task. Do not report on the patient 's preference or willingness to perform a specified task. 2. The level of ability refers to the level of assistance (if any) that the patient requires to safely complete a specified task. 3. While the presence or absence of a caregiver may impact the way a patient carries out an activity, it does not impact the assessing clinician' s ability to assess the patient in order to determine and report the level of assistance that the patient requires to safely complete a task. 4. Understand what tasks are included and excluded in each item and select the OASIS response based only on included tasks. 5. If the patient 's ability varies between the different tasks included in a multi-task item, report what is true in a majority of the included tasks, giving more weight to tasks that are more frequently performed. 6. Consider medical restrictions when determining ability. For example, if the physician has ordered activity restrictions, consider this when selecting the best response to functional items related to am bulation, transferring, bathing, etc. OASIS DATA ACCURACY In any data-driven system, the quality of the output is only as good as the quality of the data input. OASIS data are used for multiple purposes, including production of quality reports for agencies, public reports on the Medicare Home Health Compare website, and to determine payment. Thus, it is imperative that the OASIS data that HHAs collect and submit be accurate and complete. Regulatory language specifying accuracy of OASIS data can be found in the Medicare Conditions of Participation Accuracy of Encoded OASIS Data 2 (For additional discussion of OASIS Data Accuracy, see Appendix B of this manual.) CMS recommends that agencies develop internal systems for monitoring data accuracy in addition to data checking features incorporated into CMS -supplied data entry software and other data entry systems. These may include clinical record audits, data entry audits, reports produced from electronic health record systems or other activities. 2 http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi - bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=1c743ade23ae8533ee0732689c166e31&r=PART&n=42y5.0.1.1.3#se42.5.484 120 OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 1 OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chapter 1-8 HHAs can correct nearly all erroneous assessments themselves following professional standards for correcting documents. Information related to correction of erroneous OASIS data can be found in Appendix B of this manual. OASIS DATA ENCODING AND TRANSMISSION HHAs are required to encode and electronically submit OASIS data to CMS within 30 days of the date the assessment was completed. The requirements are specified in the Medicare Conditions of Participation3 related to Encoding OASIS Data, Transmittal of OASIS Data, and Data Format, as summarized in Appendix E of this manual. Detailed instructions on encoding and transmitting OASIS data are found in the HHA System User 's Guide and the OASIS Validation Report Messages and Description Guide (both available at QIES Technical Support Office - OASIS User Guides and Training).4 3 http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi -bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=5aad0315b2e678ef56bbbd491bc8b31b&n=42y5.0.1.1.3&r= PART&ty=HTML#42:5.0.1.1.3.2.7.7 4 https://qtso.cms.gov/hhatrain.html OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 2 OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chapter 2-1 CHAPTER 2 ALL TIME POINTS VERSIONS Chapter 2 contains the following sets of OASIS items: All Items: This is the entire set of OASIS Items that are collected at any point in time during a home health episode of care. At any one point in time, only a subset of OASIS items is collected. Patient Tracking Sheet: This information is collected at Start of Care and updated as needed at subsequent time points. Note: Patient Tracking Sheet items are required to be included in the data submission record for each time point, although they are collected at Start of Care and only updated as needed at subsequent time points. Refer to the OASIS Data Specifications on the CMS Web site at https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality -Initiatives -Patient -Assessm ent- Instruments/OASIS/DataSpecifications.html . Start of Care (SOC): This information is collected at Start of Care in addition to all OASIS items on the Patient Tracking Sheet. Resumption of Care (ROC): This information is collected at Resumption of Care in addition to M0032 Resumption of Care Date on the Patient Tracking Sheet. Follow -Up (FU): This information is collected at Recertification and Other Follow -up. Transfer (TRN): This information is collected at Transfer to Inpatient Facility, with or wit hout Discharge from Home Health Agency .

If agency policy allows assessments to be performed over more than one visit date, the last date (when the final assessment data are collected) is the appropriate date to record. - T he M0090 date assessment completed will indicate the last day the clinician gathered or received any input used to complete the comprehensive assessment document, which includes the OASIS items. The comprehensive assessment is a legal document and when signed by the assessing clinician, the signature serves as an attestation that to the best of his/her knowledge, the document, including OASIS responses, reflects the patient status as assessed, documented and/or supported in the patient 's clinical record. Some OASIS elements, for instance the Clinical Records Items (Patient Name, Birth Date, Medicare Number, etc.), may be completed initially by clerical staff as part of the intake/referral process; but should be verified by the assessing clinician when completing the assessment. For OASIS items requiring a patient assessment, the collaborating healthcare providers (e.g., other agency clinical staff: LPN/LVN, PTA, COTA, MSW, HHA) should have had direct in- person contact with the patient, or have had some other means of gathering information to c ontribute to the OASIS data collection (health care monitoring devices, video streaming, review of photograph, phone call, etc.). When collaboration is utilized, the assessing clinician is responsible for considering available input from these other sources, and selecting the appropriate OASIS item response(s), within the appropriate timeframe and consistent with data collection guidance. M0090 (Date Assessment Completed) will indicate the last day the assessing clinician gathered or receive an input used to complete the comprehensive assessment document, which includes the OASIS items. Any exception to this general convention concerning collaboration is identified in item -specific guidance. If the assessing clinician gathers additional information during th e assessment time frame that would result in changing the coding of one or more OASIS items (for instance, identifies functional or cognitive information that he/she believes is more representative of the patient 's usual status than the code originally selected ), the M0090 date would be changed to reflect the date the latest information was gathered and the response change was made.

OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3: Section B - Clinical Record Items OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chapter 3: B -9 RESPONSE- SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS (cont 'd for OASIS ITEM M0110) Assessment strategies: Consult all available sources of information to answer this item. Medicare systems, such as Health Insurance Query for Home Health (HIQH), can provide this information. If calculating manually, note that the Medicare home health payment episode ordinarily comprises 60 days beginning with the start of care date, or 60 days beginning with the recertification date, and that there can be a gap of up to 60 days between episodes in the same sequence, counting from the last day of one episode until the first day of the next . Remember that a sequence of adjacent Medicare payment episodes continues as long as there is no 60 -day gap, even if Medicare episodes are provided by different home health agencies . Episodes where Medicare fee-for-service is not the payer (such as HMO, Medicaid, or private pay) do NOT count as part of a sequence. If the period of service with those payers is 60 days or more, the next Medicare home health payment episode would begin a new sequence. Remember t hat the 60-day gap is counted from the end of the Medicare payment episode, not from the date of the last visit or discharge, which can occur earlier. (If the episode is ended by an intervening event that causes it to be paid as a partial episode payment [ PEP] adjustment, then the last visit date is the end of the episode).

The purpose of this item is to establish the patient 's recent health care history before formulating the Plan of Care. This determination must be made with sufficient accuracy to allow appropriate care planning. For example, the amount and types of rehabilitation treatment the patient has received and the type of institution that delivered the treatment are important to know when developing the home health Plan of Care.

For example, patient may have been discharged from both a hospital and a rehabilitation facility within the past 14 days. An inpat ient facility discharge that occurs on the day of the assessment does fall within the 14-day period. The term \"past 14 days \" is the two -week period immediately preceding the Start/Resumption of Care date. This means that for purposes of counting the 14-day period, the Start of Care date is day 0 and the day immediately prior to the Start of Care date is day 1. For example, if the patient 's SOC date is August 20, any inpatient discharges falling on or after August 6 and prior to the HHA admission would be reported. Discharges on Day 0 should be included. Facil ity type is determined by the facility 's state license.

Even t hough the patient may have been discharged from more than one facility in the past 14 days, use the most recent date of discharge from any inpatient facility. If t he date or month is only one digit, tha t digit is preceded by a \"0\" (for example, May 4, 2019 = 05/04/ 2019). Enter all four digits of the year.

Diagnoses are listed in the order that best reflects the seriousness of each condition and supports the disciplines and services provided. Rate the degree of symptom control for each condition in Column 2. ICD -10-CM sequencing requirements must be followed if multiple coding is indicated for any diagnoses. Code each row according to the following directions for each column . Column 1: Enter the description of the diagnosis. Sequencing of diagnoses should reflect the seriousness of each condition and support the disciplines and services provided. Column 2: Enter the ICD -10-CM code for the condition described in Column 1 - no surgical or procedure codes allowed. Codes must be entered at the level of highest specificity and ICD -10-CM coding rules and sequencing requirements must be followed. Note that external cause codes (ICD -10-CM codes beginning with V, W, X, or Y) may not be reported in M1021 (Primary Diagnosis) but may be reported in M1023 (Secondary Diagnoses). Also note that when a Z -code is reported in Column 2, the code for the underlying condition can often be entered in Column 2, as long as it is an active on-going condition impacting home health care. Rate the degree of symptom control for the condition listed in Column 1. Do not assign a symptom control rating if the diagnosis code is a V , W, X, Y or Z-code. Choose one value that represents the degree of symptom control appropriate for each diagnosis using the following scale: 0 - Asymptomatic, no treatment needed at this time 1 - S ymptoms well controlled with current therapy 2 - Symptom s controlled with difficulty, affecting daily functioning; patient needs ongoing monitoring 3 - Symptoms poorly controlled; patient needs frequent adjustment in treatment and dose monitoring 4 - Symptoms poorly controlled; history of re-hospitalizations Note that the rating for symptom control in Column 2 should not be used to determine the sequencing of the diagnoses listed in Column 1.

The patient 's primary home health diagnosis is defined as the chief reason the patient is receiving home care and the diagnosis most related to the current home health Plan of Care. M1023: the intent of thi s item is to accurately report and code the patient 's secondary home health diagnoses and document the degree of symptom control for each diagnosis . Secondary diagnoses are comorbid conditions that exist at the time of the assessment, that are actively addressed in the patient 's Plan of Care, or that have the potential to affect the patient 's responsiveness to treatment and rehabilitative prognosis. TIME POINTS ITEM(S) COMPLETED Start of care Res umption of care Fol low-up RESPONSE- SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS HHA clinicians and coders must comply with the ICD - 10-CM Of fi cial Guidelines for Coding and Reporting when assigning primary and secondary diagnoses to the OASIS items M1021 and M1023. See Chapter 5 for link . OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3: Section C - Patient History and Diagnoses OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chapter 3: C -6 RESPONSE- SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS (cont 'd for OASIS ITEMS M1021/1023) The ICD -10-CM is a morbidity classification published by the United States for classifying diagnoses and reason for care in all health care settings. The ICD -10-CM is based on the ICD -10, the international classification of disease published by the W orld Health Organization (WHO). The ICD -10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting were developed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). These guidelines are a set of rules that have been developed to accompany and complement the official conventions and instructions provided within the ICD -10-CM itself and should be used as a companion document to the official version of the ICD -10-CM List of Codes and D escriptions . Adherence to the ICD -10-CM Offici al Guidelines for Coding and Reporting when assigning ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes is required under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). It is expected that each agency will ensure that diagnoses and ICD -10-CM codes reported in the OASIS data set meet these guidelines. Identifying the patient 's Primary and Secondary Home Health Diagnoses The assessing clinician is expected to complete the patient 's comprehensive assessment and under s tand the patient 's overall medical condition and care needs before selecting and assigning diagn oses and may elicit input from other agency staff that have had direct in-person contact with the pa tient, or have had some other means of gathering information to contribute to the OASIS data col lection. The determination of the patient 's primary and secondary home health diagnoses must be made by the assessing clinician based on the findings of the assessment, information in the medical record, and input from the physician. As noted in the Item Intent, the patient 's primary diagnosis is defined as the chief reason the patient is receiving home care and the diagnosis most related to the current home health Plan of Care. The primary diagnosis may or may not relate to the patient 's most recent hospital stay, but must relate to the skilled services (skilled nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech language pathology) rendered by the HHA. As noted in the Item Intent, the secondary diagnoses include coexisting conditions actively addressed in the patient 's Plan of Care, and any comorbid conditions having the potential to affect the patient 's responsiveness to treatment and rehabilitative prognosis. The secondary diagnoses may or may not be related to a patient 's recent hospital stay, but must have the potential to impact the skilled services provided by the HHA. When determining secondary diagnoses, the assessing clinician should consider diagnoses that are actively addressed in the Plan of Care as well as diagnoses that affect the patient 's responsi veness to treatment and rehabilitative prognosis, even if the condition is not the focus of any home health treatment itself. Diagnoses may change during the course of the home health stay due to a change in the patient 's health status or a change in the focus of home health care. At each required OASIS time point, the clinician must assess the patient 's clinical status and determine the primary and secondary diagnoses based on patient status and treatment plan at the time of the assessment. Only current medical diagnoses should be reported as primary or secondary diagnoses in M1021 and M1023. Diagnoses should be excluded if they are resolved or do not have the potential to impact the skilled services provided by the HHA. An example of a resolved condition i s cholecystitis following a cholecystectomy . In addition to following the ICD -10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting, selection of home health diagnoses must be performed in compliance with Medicare' s rules and regulations for coverage and payment to ensure provider compliance with Section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act. Section 1862(a)(1)(A) excludes provider services from Medicare coverage and payment that \"are not reasonable and necessary for diagnosis or treatment of illness or inj ury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member. \" OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3: Section C - Patient History and Diagnoses OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chapter 3: C -7 RESPONSE- SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS (cont 'd for OASIS ITEMS M1021/1023) Reporting Primary and Secondary Diagnoses in M1021 and M1023 At each required OASIS time point, the assessing clinician should enter the patient 's current primary and secondary diagnoses in Column 1 of M1021 and M1023. Complete Column 1 from top to bottom, leaving any blank entries at the bottom. The order that secondary diagnoses are entered should be determined by the degree that they impact the patient 's health and need for home health care, rather than the degree of symptom control. For example, if a patient is receiving home health care for Type 2 diabetes that is \"controlled with difficulty, \" this diagnosis would be listed above a diagnosis of a fungal infection of a toenail that is receiving treatment, even if the fungal infection is \"poorly controlled. \" Reporting ICD -10-CM Codes in Column 2 of M1021 and M1023 The assessing clinician can enter the actual numeric ICD -10-CM c odes for each diagnosis listed in Column 1 and 2 of M1021 and M1023, once the assessment is completed and the diagnosis is entered in Column 1. Alternatively, a coding specialist in the agency may enter the actual numeric ICD-10-CM codes in Column 2, as long as the assessing clinician has determined the primary and secondary diagnoses in Column 1. The correct process for selecting an ICD -10-CM code using the Alphabetic Index and the Tabular List is described in the ICD -10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting. Follow the official conventions and instructions provided within the ICD -10-CM List of Codes and Descriptions and the Official Guidelines to code each row in Column 2. Each ICD -10-CM code must be entered at its highest level of specificity (diagnosis codes only - no surgical or procedure codes allowed). ICD-10-CM does not allow external cause codes (ICD -10-CM cod es beginning with V, W, X, or Y) to be reported in M1021 (Primary Diagnosis) but they may be reported in M1023 (Secondary Diagnoses ). Also note that when a Z -code is reported in Column 2, the code for the underlying condition may be entered in Column 2, as long as it is a current on-going condition that has a potential to impact the skilled services provided by the HHA. See the ICD -10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting for complete instructions on code assignment and sequencing related to the use of Z - codes and use of multiple coding for a single condition (such as manifestation/etiology pairs). Reporting the Symptom Control Rating in Column 2 of M1021 and M1023. At each required time point, the assessing clinician should record the symptom control ratings for each primary and secondary diagnosis in column 2 of M1021 and M1023. Assessing degree of symptom control includes review of presenting signs and symptoms, type and number of medications, frequency of treatment readjustments, and frequency of contact with health care provider. Inquire about the degree to which each condition limits daily activities. Assess the patient to determine if symptoms are controlled by current treatments. Clarify which diagnoses/symptoms have been poorly controlled in the recent past. Choose one value that represents the degree of symptom control appropriate for each diagnosis using the scale provided in the M1021/M1023 instructions. Refer to the ICD -10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting for instructions on multiple coding for a single condition (such as manifestation/etiology pairs).

These diagnoses influence a patient's functional outcomes or increase a patient's risk for development or worsening of pressure ulcer(s). Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of care Resumption of care Response -Specific Instructions 1. Identify diagnoses : The diseases and conditions in this item require a physician (or nurse practitioner, physician assistant, clinical nurse specialist, or other authorized licensed staff if allowable under state licensure laws) documented diagnosis at the time of assessment. Clini cal record sources for physician (or nurse practitioner, physician assistant, clinical nurse specialist, or other authorized licensed staff if allowable under state licensure laws) diagnoses include, but are not limited to, transfer documents, physician progress notes, recent history and physical, discharge summary, physician orders, and consults. Available documentation may be limited at admission/start of care. Admission/start of care assessment m ay indicate symptoms associated with one of this item's listed conditions while a documented diagnosis is not present in available records. The clinician should contact the physician (or other, as listed above) to ask if the patient has the diagnosis. Once a diagnosis has been identified, determine if the diagnosis is active. Although open communication regarding diagnostic information between the physician and other clinical staff is important, it is also essential that diagnoses communicated verbally be d ocumented in the clinical record by the physician (or nurse practitioner, physician assistant, clinical nurse specialist, or other licensed staff if allowable under state licensure laws) to ensure follow-up and coordination of care. Diagno stic information, including past medical and surgical history obtained from family members and close contacts, must also be documented in the clinical record by the OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3: Section C - Patient History and Diagnoses OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chapter 3: C -10 RESPONSE- SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS (cont 'd for OASIS ITEMS M1028 ) physician (or nurse practitioner, physician assistant, clinical nurse specialist, or other authorized licensed staff if allowable under state licensure laws) to ensure validity, follow-up and coordination of care. Only dia gnoses confirmed and documented by the physician (or nurse practitioner, physi cian assistant, clinical nurse specialist, or other authorized licensed staff if allowable under state licensure laws) should be considered when coding this item. 2. Determ ine whether diagnoses are active: Once a diagnosis is identified, determine whether the diagnosis is active. If infor mation regarding active diagnoses is learned after the end of the assessment time frame, the OASIS data set should not be revised to reflect this new information. The OASIS data set should reflect what was known and documented at the time of the assessment. If, ho wever, it comes to light after the data set is submitted that a documented active diagnosis was present but not indicated on the OASIS data set, the Home Health Agency should modify the OASIS data set in accordance with the instructions in the Survey and Certification Memo #15-18- HHA, Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) transition to the Automated Submission and Processing System (ASAP) and OASIS Correction policy. A copy of this memo is located on CMS.gov under Provider Enrollme nt and Certification/Quality Safety & Oversight - General Information/Policy & Memos to States and Regions. For additional details, please reference the OASIS Submission User's Guide and Training site (QTSO site). DEFINITION ACTIVE DIAGNOSES Active diagnoses are diagnoses that have a direct relationship to the patient's current functional, cognitive, mood or behavior status; medical treatments; nurse monitoring; or risk of death at the time of assessment. Do not include diseases or conditions that have been resolved or do not affect the patient's current functional, cognitive, or mood or behavior status; medical treatments; nurse monitoring; or risk of death at the time of assessment. Coding I nstructions Code 1, Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) or Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD), if the patient has an active diagnosis of Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) or Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD), indicated by any of the following diagnosis codes: Codes that start with the first 4 characters of: I70.2, Atherosclerosis of native arteries of the extremities I70.3, Atherosclerosis of unspecified type of bypass graft(s) of the extremities I70.4, Atherosclerosis of autologous vein bypass graft(s) of the extremities OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3: Section C - Patient History and Diagnoses OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chapter 3: C -11 RESPONSE- SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS (cont 'd for OASIS ITEMS M1028 ) I70.5, At herosclerosis of nonautologous biological extremities I70.6, At herosclerosis of nonbiological bypass graft(s) of the extremities I70.7, At herosclerosis of other type of bypass graft(s) of the extremities I70.91, G eneralized atherosclerosis I70.92, C hronic total occlusion of artery of the extremities Codes that start with the first 3 characters of: I73, O ther peripheral vascular diseases Code 2, Diabetes Mellitus (DM), if the patient has an active diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) indicated by any of the following diagnosis codes: Codes that start with the first 3 characters of: E08, Diabe tes mellitus due to underlying condition E09, Dru g or chemical induced diabetes mellitus E10, Type 1 di abetes mellitus E11, abetes mellitus E13, Other specified diabetes mellitus Code 3, None of the Above, if the patient does not have any of the active diagnoses listed above. A dash is a valid response for this item. CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Coding Tips The following tips may assist staff in determining whether a disease or condition should be coded as an active diagnosis. The phys ician (nurse practitioner, physician assistant, clinical nurse specialist, or other authorized licensed staff if allowable under state licensure laws) may specifically indicate that a diagnosis is active. If ther e is documentation in the clinical record that a patient has diabetes mellitus, Select Response 2, Diabetes Mellitus (DM). If there is only documentation in the clinical record of a complication such as nephropathy or neuropathy and there is no documentation that the patient has diabetes, it should not be assumed the complication is associated with diabetes, and Response 2, Diabetes Mellitus, should not be checked. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3: Section C - Patient History and Diagnoses OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chapter 3: C -12 RESPONSE- SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS (cont 'd for OASIS ITEMS M1028 ) The ph ysician (nurse practitioner, physician assistant, clinical nurse specialist or other authorized licensed staff if allowable under state licensure laws) for example, documents at the time of assessment that the patient has inadequately controlled diabetes and requires adjustment of the medication regimen. This would be sufficient documentation of an active diagnosis and would require no additional confirmation because the physician documented the diagnosis and also confirmed that the medication regimen needed to be modified. Examples 1. Active Diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus Mr. A is prescribed insulin for diabetes mellitus. He requires regular blood glucose monitoring to determine whether blood glucose goals are achieved by the current medication regimen. The physician progress note documents diabetes mellitus. Coding: M1028, Active Diagnoses, would be coded 2, Diabetes Mellitus. Rationale: This would be considered an active diagnosis because the physician progress note documents the diabetes mellitus diagnosis, and because there is ongoing medication management and glucose monitoring. 2. None of the Above During the SOC/ROC assessment, Mrs. K told Nurse J, RN that she has had diabetes for 20 years. Nurse J reviewed the transfer documents from the acute care facility and all clinical records on the patient but was unable find a documented diagnosis of Diabet es Mellitus by physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant or authorized licensed staff member in their state. There is no documented diagnosis of PVD or PAD. Coding: M1028, Active Diagnoses, would be coded 3, None of the Above. Rationale: This wo uld be considered a \"none of the above\" response because the nurse was unable to find the diagnosis of diabetes at the time of assessment, documented by a physician (or nurse practitioner, physician assistant, clinical nurse specialist, or other authorized licensed staff if allowable under state licensure laws). And, there is no documented diagnosis of PVD or PAD.

Height (in inches). Record most recent height measure since the most recent SOC/ROC inches b. Weight (in pounds). Base weight on most recent measure in last 30 days; measure weight consistently, according to standard agency practice (for example, in a.m. after voiding, before meal, with shoes off, etc.) Item Intent These items support calculation of the patient's body mass index (BMI) using the patient's height and weight. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of care Resumption of care Response -Spec ific Instructions Coding Instructions M1060 - a, Height Measure height in accordance with the agency's policies and procedures. Measure and record the patient's height to the nearest whole inch. Use mathematical rounding (i.e., if height measurement is X.5 inches or greater, round height upward to the nearest whole inch. If height measurement number is X.1 to X.4 inches, round down to the nearest whole inch). For example, a height of 62.5 inches would be rounded to 63 inches, and a height of 62.4 inches would be rounded to 62 inches. Only enter a height that has been directly measured by agency staff. Do not enter a height that is self -reported or derived from documentation from another provider setting. M1060 - b, Weight Weight should be measured in accordance with the agency's policies and procedures. Measure and record the patient's weight in pounds. Use mathematical rounding (e.g., if weight is X.5 pounds [lbs.] or more, round weight upward to the nearest whole pound. If weight is X.1 to X.4 lbs., round down to the nearest whole pound). For example, a weight of 152.5 lbs. would be rounded to 153 lbs. and a weight of 152.4 lbs. would be rounded to 152 lbs. pounds OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3: Section C - Patient History and Diagnoses OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chapter 3: C -21 RESPONSE- SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS (cont 'd for OASIS ITEMS M1060 ) If agency staff weighs the patient multiple times during the assessment period, use the first weight. Only enter a weight that has been directly measured by agency staff. Do not enter a weight that is self -reported or derived from documentation from anothe r provider setting. A dash i s a valid response for this item. CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Coding Tips When reporting height for a patient with bilateral lower extremity amputation, me asure and record the patient's current height (i.e., height after bilateral amputation). If a patient cannot be weighed, for example, because of extreme pain, immobility, or risk of pathological fractures, the use of a dash ( - ) is appropriate. Document the rationale on the patient's medical record. When t here is an unsuccessful attempt to measure a patient's height or weight, at SOC/ROC, and there is a documented agency-obtained height or weight from one or more previous home health visits, an agency-obtained height or weight from a documented visit conducted within the previous 30-day window may be used to complete M1060 for this SOC/ROC assessment. Whenever possible, a current height and weight should be obtained by the agency as part of the SOC/ROC assessment. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3: Section D - Living Arrangements OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chapter 3: D -1 OASIS ITEM (M1100) Patient Living Situation: Which of the following best describes the patient 's residential circumstance and availability of assistance? (Check one box only.) Availability of Assistance Living Arrangement Around the clock Regular daytime Regular nighttime Occasional / short -term assistance No assistance available a. Patient lives alone 01 02 03 04 05 b. Patient lives with other person(s) in the home 06 07 08 09 10 c. Patient lives in congregate situation ( for example, assisted living, residential care home) 11 12 13 14 15 ITEM INTENT This item identifies, using the care provider 's professional judgment, a) whether the patient is living alone or with other(s) and b) the availability of caregiver(s) (other than home health agency staff) to provide in-person assistance. TIME POINTS ITEM(S) COMPLETED Start of care Res umption of care RESPONSE- SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS To answer this question: - Fi rst, determine living arrangement - whether the patient normally lives alone, in a home with others, or in a congregate setting. - Seco nd, determine availability of assistance - how frequently caregiver(s) are in the home and available to provide assistance if needed. - On ly one response should be marked . Select the appropriate row (a, b, or c) to reflect the patient 's living situation, then select the one response in the column that best describes the availability of in-person assistance at the time of the OASIS assessment. Li ving Arrangement - Sel ect a response from R ow a if the patient lives alone in an independent (non-assisted) setting. For example, the patient lives alone in a home, in their own apartment, or in their own room at a boarding house. A patient with only live -in paid help is considered to be living alone. A patient who normally lives alone but temporarily has a caregiver staying in the home to provide assistance is considered to be living alone. A patient who lives alone but can obtain emergency help by phone or li fe-line, is still living alone. - Sel ect a response from Row b if the patient lives with others in an independent (non- assisted) setting . For example, the patient lives with a spouse, family member or another significant other in an independent (non-assisted) setting. A patient who normally lives with others but is occasionally alone because caregiver(s) are traveling out of town is still considered to be living with others. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3: Section D - Living Arrangements OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chapter 3: D -2 RESPONSE- SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS (cont 'd for OASIS Item M1 100) - S elect a response from Row c if the patient lives in an \" assisted living\" setting (assistance, supervision and/or oversight are provided as part of the living arrangement). For example, the patient lives alone or with a spouse or partner in an apartment or room that is part of an assisted living facility, residential care home, or personal care home. - I f the patient has recently changed their living arrangement due to their condition, report the usual living arrangement prior to the illness , injury or e xacerbation for which the patient is receiving care, unless the new living arrangement is expected to be permanent . A vailability of Assistance - I dentify the frequency with which any in-person assistance is available: A round the clock means there is someone available in the home to provide assistance to the patient 24 hours a day. Re gular daytime means someone is in the home and available to provide assistance during daytime hours every day with infrequent exceptions. Re gular nighttime means someone is in the home and available to provide assistance during nighttime hours every night with infrequent exceptions. Occasi onal/short -term assistance means someone is available to provide in-person assistance only for a few hours a day or on an irregular basis, or may be only able to help occasionally. No assistance available means there is no one available to provide any in-person assistance. - Clinical judgment must be used to determine w hich hours constitute \"regular daytime\" and \"regular night time\" based on the patient 's specific activities and routines. No hours are specifically designated as daytime or nighttime. - Av ailability of assistance refers to in-person assistance provided in the home of the patient. It includes any type of in-person assistance, including but not limited to ADLs and IADLs. If a person is in an assisted living or congregate setting with a call -bell that summons onsite, in-person help, this is considered in-person assistance. If its use is restricted to emergencies only, report the availability as occasional/short -term assistance unless other caregiver 's availability meets a higher level. - The c aregiver(s) need not live in the home with the patient, but assistance via telephone is not included in this question. - Th is item doc uments the time caregiver(s) are in the home and available without regard to the amount or types of assistance the patient requires, or whether the caregiver(s) are able to meet all or only some of the patient 's needs. Adequacy of caregiver assistance for different types of needs is captured in M2102. - Us e your professional judgment to determine if someone will be available to provide any assistance to the patient. If a person is living in the patient 's home but is completely unable to or unwilling to provide any assistance to the patient, do not count them as a caregiver. - Av ailability of assistance refers to the expected availability and willingness of caregiver(s) for this upcoming care episode . Examp les: - Pat ient lives alone in her own apartment. Since her discharge from the hospital, her two daughters alternate staying with her during the day and night so that one of them is always there, except for the times when one goes out to run an errand or pick up a child at day care. Response = 01 (Patient sti ll considered to be living alone, since daughters are only staying there temporarily. Daughters are providing round-the -clock care, even if one occasionally needs to be out of the house for brief periods.) - Patient lives alone in her home but her son and daughter -in-law live across the street. They bring the patient dinner every night and are available around the clock by telephone. Response = 04 (Son and daughter -in-law are not there to provide in- person assistance consistently, day or evening, even if they live across the street and are available by phone.) OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3: Section D - Living Arrangements OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chapter 3: D -3 RESPONSE- SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS (cont 'd for OASIS Item M1100) - Patient lives with her daughter who works during the day but is home every evening and sleeps there ever y night. A paid aide comes in 3 days a week to assist with ADLs. Daughter has back problems that prevent her from lifting patient, but she assists the patient with dressing every morning and takes the patient to doctor 's appointments. Response = 08 (Patient lives in a home with others who are available every night to offer in-person assistance. Even if the daughter can' t meet all of patient 's needs, she is available all night.) - Pati ent lives with her husband who has significant cognitive and functional impairments, is wheelchair bound, and is unable to provide the patient with any assistance. A member of the church comes by one evening a week and brings groceries . Response = 09 (Patient lives in a home with another person who is there 24 hours but is unavailable to provide assistance. Caregiver from church provides occasional assistance.) - Pati ent lives alone in an apartment that is part of an ALF . The apartment does not have a call-bell but her contract with the ALF includes having a home health aide assist her with ADLs 2 hours every morning. Her son also comes over occasionally to assist with bills, groceries, and errands . Response = 14 (Patient is living in a congregate setting; one caregiver is available to assist for some part of every day on a regular basis, but not all day, another caregiver offers occasional assistance.)

A s specified within the OASIS question, only assess functional vision with corrective lenses if the patient usually wears corrective lenses. A magnifying glass (as might be used to read newsprint) is not an example of corrective lenses . R eading glasses (including \"grocery store\" reading glasses) are considered to be cor rective lenses. P hysical deficits or impairments that limit the patient 's ability to use their existing vision in a functional way should be considered. For example, if a physical deficit/impairment (like limited neck range of motion) prevents a patient from seeing objects in his path, affecting safe function in his environment, M1200 should be Response 2 - Severely impaired. A ssessment strategies: In the health history interview, ask the patient about vision problems (for example, cataracts) and whether or not the patient uses glasses .

P ain interferes with activity when the pain results in the activity being performed less often than otherwise desired, requires the patient to have additional assistance in performing the activity, or causes the activity to take longer to complete . Include all activities (for example, sleeping, recreational activities, watching television), not just ADLs. When reviewing patient 's medications, the presence of medication for pain or joint disease provides an opportunity to explore the presence of pain, when the pain is the most severe, activities with which the pain interferes, and the frequency of this interference with activity or movement . Be careful not to overlook seemingly unimportant activities (for example, the patient says she/he sits in the chair all day and puts off going to the bathroom, because it hurts so much to get up from the chair or to walk) . Evaluating the patient 's ability to perform ADLs and IADLs can provide additional information about such pain. Assessing pain in a nonverbal patient involves observation of facial expression (for example, frowning, gritting teeth), monitoring heart rate, respiratory rate, perspiration, pallor, pupil size, irritability, or use of visual pain scales (for example, FACES) . The patient 's treatment for pain (whether pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic) must be considered when evaluating whether pain interferes with activity or movement .

TIME POINTS ITEM(S) COMPLETED Start of care Resumption of care Follow -up Discharge from agency - not to inpatient facility RESPONSE- SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS Home health agencies may adopt the NPUAP guidelines in their clinical practice and documentation. However, since CMS has adapted the NPUAP guidelines for OASIS purposes, the definitions do not perfectly align with each stage as described by NPUAP. When dis crepancies exist between the NPUAP definitions and the OASIS scoring instructions provided in the OASIS Guidance M anual and CMS Q&A 's, providers should rely on the CMS OASIS instructions. Pressure ulcers /injuries are defined as localized injury to the skin and/or underlying tissue usually over a bony prominence, as a result of pressure, or pressure in combination with shear and/or friction. If pressure is not the primary cause of the lesion, do not report the wound as a pressure ulcer /injury . Terminology referring to \"healed\" vs. \"unhealed\" ulcers can refer to whether the ulcer is \"closed\" vs. \"open\". Recognize, however, that Stage 1 pressure injuries and Deep Tissue Injur y (DTI), although closed (intact skin), would not be considered healed. Unstageable pressure ulcers /injuries , whether covered with a non- removable dressing or eschar or slough, would not be considered healed. Enter Response 0 (No), if the only pressure ulcer/injury is one or more Stage 1 OR healed pressure ulcers /injuries (of any previou s stage) AND the patient has no other pressure ulcers /injuries . Enter Response 1 (Yes), if the patient has an unhealed Stage 2 , Stage 3 , OR Stage 4 pressure ulcer OR if the patient has an Unstageable ulcer /injury , defined as: - Pressure ulcers /injuries that are known to be present but that are unobservable due to a dressing /device, such as a cast, that cannot be removed to assess the skin underneath. \"Known\" refers to when documentation is available that states a pressure ulcer /injury exists under the n on-removable dressing/device. - Pressure ulcers that have eschar (tan, black, or brown) or slough (yellow, tan, gray, green or brown) tissue present such that the anatomic depth of soft tissue damage cannot be visualized in the wound bed, should be classifie d as unstageable. If the wound bed is only partially covered by eschar or slough, and the anatomical depth of tissue damage can be visualized, numerically stage the ulcer, and do not code this as unstageable. o Pressure ulcers that are covered with slough and/or eschar, and the wound bed cannot be visualized, should be coded as unstageable because the true anatomic depth of soft tissue damage (and therefore stage) cannot be determined. Only until enough slough and/or eschar is removed to expose the anatomic depth of soft tissue damage involved, can the stage of the wound be determined. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3: Section F - Integumentary OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chapter 3: F -2 RESPONSE- SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS (cont'd for OASIS ITEM M1306) - Deep tissue injury which is defined as a purple or maroon localized area of discolored intact skin or blood- filled blister due to damage of underlying soft tissue from pressure and/or shear. The area may be preceded by tissue that is painful, firm, mushy, boggy, warmer, or cooler as compared to adjacent tissue. Deep tissue injury may be difficult to detect in individuals with dark skin tones. Stage 2 (partial thickness) pressure ulcers heal through the process of regeneration of the epidermis across a wound surface, known as \"re -epithelialization.\" Stage 3 and 4 (full thickness) pressure ulcers heal through a process of granulation (filling of the wound with connective/scar tissue), contraction (wound margins contract and pull together), and re-epithelialization (covers with epithelial tissue from within wound bed and/or from wound margins). Once the pressure ulcer has fully granulated and the wound surface is completely covered with new epithelial tissue, the wound is considered closed, and will continue to remodel and increase in tensile strength. For the purposes of scoring the OASIS, the wound is considered healed at this point, and should no longer be reported as an unhealed pressure ulcer.

TIME POINTS ITEM(S) COMPLETED Discharge from agency - not to inpatient facility RESPONSE- SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS Do not reverse stage pressure ulcers as a way to document healing as it does not accurately characterize what is physiologically occurring as the ulcer heals. For example, over time, even though a Stage 4 pressure ulcer has been healing and contracting such that it is less deep, wide, and long, the tissues that were lost (muscle, fat, dermis) will never be replaced with the same type of tissue. Clinical standards require that this ulcer continue to be documented as a Stage 4 pressure ulcer until it has healed. Stage 2 (partial thickness) pressure ulcers heal through the process of regeneration of the epidermis across a wound surface called, \"re-epithelialization.\" Enter Response 1 only if the oldest Stage 2 pressure ulcer that is present at discharge was already present as a Stage 2 pressure ulcer at the first skin assessment completed at the SOC/ROC. Enter Response 2 if the oldest Stage 2 pressure ulcer that is present at discharge was NOT a Stage 2 pressure ulcer at the first skin assessment completed at the SOC/ROC. If Response 2 is entered, specify the date the Stage 2 pressure ulcer was first identified. Use two digits to indicate the month (for example, May is 05), single-digit dates should begin with 0, and use four digits to indicate the year (for example, May 4, 201 9 would be 05/04/2019 ). If no pressure ulcer existed at the SOC, then a Stage 1 pressure injury developed, which progressed to a Stage 2 by discharge, enter Response 2, and specify the date that the pressure ulcer was first identified as a Stage 2 ulcer. Enter \"NA\" if the patient has no Stage 2 pressure ulcers at the time of discharge, or all previous Stage 2 pressure ulcers have healed. An ulcer that is suspected of being a Stage 2 , but is Unstageable due to non-removable dressing /device at the time of discharge , should not be identified as the \"oldest Stage 2 pressure ulcer\" (See M1311 for definition of Unstageable due to non-removable dressing/device).

At discharge, this item also identifies if each pressure ulcer/injury present on the discharge assessment was observed at the same stage at the time of the most recent SOC/ROC. Stage 1 pressure injuries and all healed pressure ulcers/injuries are not reported in this item. TIME POINTS ITEMS COMPLETED Start of Care Resumption of Care Follow -up Discharge from agency - not to inpatient facility RESPONSE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS Terminology referring to \"healed\" vs. \"unhealed\" ulcers /injuries can refer to whether the ulcer /injury is \"closed\" vs. \"open\". Recognize, however, that Stage 1 pressure injuries and Deep Tissue Injury (DTI), although closed ( intact skin ), would not be considered healed. Unstageable pressure ulcers /injuries , whether covered with a non-removable dressing or eschar or slough, would not be considered healed. Determining \"Present at the most recent SOC/ROC \" to answer M1311X2 For each pressure ulcer /injury observed and coded in items M1311A1-F1 on Discharge, determine whether that pressure ulcer /injury was observ ed at the same stage at the time of the most recent SOC/ROC, and did not form during this home health quality episode. If the pressure ulcer /injury was unstageable at SOC/ROC, but becomes numerically stageable later, when completing the Discharge assessmen t, its \"Present at the most recent SOC/ROC \" stage should be considered the stage at which it first becomes numerically stageable. If it subsequently increases in numerical stage, do not report the higher stage ulcer as being \"present at the most recent SOC /ROC\" when completing the Discharge assessment. The general standard of practice for patients starting or resuming care is that patient assessments are completed as close to the actual time of the SOC/ROC as possible. For example, i f a pressure ulcer /injury that is identified on the SOC date increases in numerical stage within the assessment time frame, the stage of the pressure ulcer/injury at the first skin assessment completed would be reported in M1311X1 at the SOC . At SOC/ROC and FU , enter a response for the following rows of this item: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1. - Example: At SOC, in B1, enter the number of Stage 3 pressure ulcers that are observed at the first skin assessment completed during the SOC assessment timeframe.

Definition: Stage 2 pressure ulcers are c haracterized by partial thickness loss of dermis presenting as a shallow open ulcer with a red- pink wound bed, without slough. May also present as an intact or open/ruptured blister. Examine the area adjacent to or surrounding an intact blister for evidence of tissue damage. If other conditions are ruled out and the tissue adjacent to or surrounding the blister demonstrates signs of tissue damage (e.g., color change, tenderness, bogginess or firmness, warmth or coolness) , these characteristics suggest a deep tissue injury (DTI) rather than a Stage 2 pressure ulcer. Stage 3 and 4 Ulcers Definition: Stage 3 pressure ulcers are characterized by full thickness tissue loss. Subcutaneous fat may be visible but bone, tendon or mu scle is not exposed. Slough may be present but does not obscure the depth of tissue loss. May include undermining or tunneling. Definition: Stage 4 pressure ulcers are characterized by full thickness tissue loss with exposed bone, tendon or muscle. Slough or eschar may be present on some parts of the wound bed. Often incl udes undermining and tunneling. If any bone, tendon or muscle or joint capsule (Stage 4 structures) is visible, the pressure ulcer should be reported as a Stage 4 pressure ulcer, regardless of the presence or absence of slough and/or eschar in the wound bed. A previously closed Stage 3 pressure ulcer that is currently open again should be reported as a Stage 3 pressure ulcer. A previously closed Stage 4 pressure ulcer that is currently open again should be reported as a Stage 4 pressure ulcer. If the patient has been in an inpatient setting for some time, it is conceivable that the wound has already started to granulate, thus making it challenging to know the highest numerical stage of the w ound. The clinician should make every effort to contact previous providers (including patient's physician) to determine the highest numerical stage of the pressure ulcer. Any type of flap procedure performed to surgically replace a pressure ulcer is repor ted as a surgical wound, until healed. It should not be reported as a pressure ulcer/injury on M1311. A pressure ulcer treated with any type of graft is no longer reported as a pressure ulcer/injury, and until healed, should be reported as a surgical wound on M1340. A pressure ulcer that has been surgically debrided remains a pressure ulcer and should not be reported as a surgical wound on M1340. Unstageable Ulcers Pressure ulcers that have eschar (tan, black, or brown) or slough (yellow, tan, gray, green or brown) tissue present such that the anatomic depth of soft tissue damage cannot be visualized in the wound bed, should be classified as unstageable. If the wound bed is only partially covered by eschar or slough, and the anatomical depth of tissue damage can be visualized, numerically stage the ulcer, and do not code this as unstageable. - Pressure ulcers that are covered with slough and/or eschar, and the wound bed cannot be visualized, should be coded as unstageable because the true anatomic depth of sof t tissue damage (and therefore stage) cannot be determined. Only until enough slough and/or eschar is removed to expose the anatomic depth of soft tissue damage involved, can the stage of the wound be determined. Any numerically stageable pressure ulcer/i njury observed at SOC/ROC that is unstageable due to slough and/or eschar at discharge, should be considered new, and not coded as present at the most recent SOC/ROC for M1311X2. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3: Section F - Integumentary OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chapter 3: F -10 DEFINITIONS SLOUGH TISSUE Non-viable yellow, tan, gray, green or brown tissue; usually moist, can be soft, stringy and mucinous in texture. Slough may be adherent to the base of the wound or present in clumps throughout the wound bed. ESCHAR TISSUE Dead or devitalized tissue that is hard or soft in texture; us ually black, brown, or tan in color, and may appear scab- like. Necrotic tissue and eschar are usually firmly adherent to the base of the wound and often the sides/edges of the wound. RESPONSE- SPECIFIC INSTRUCTI ONS (cont'd for OASIS ITEM M1311 ) Pressure ulcers /injuries that are known to be present but that are Unstageable due to a non-removable dressing /device, such as a cast that cannot be removed to assess the skin underneath , should be reported in M1311D1, Unstageable. \"Known\" refers to when documentation is availabl e that states a pressure ulcer/injury exists under the non-removable dressing/device. Examples of a non-removable dressing/device include a dressing that is not to be removed per physician's order (such as those used in negative-pressure wound therapy [NPW T], an orthopedic device, or a cast ). If an unknown pressure ulcer/injury is discovered upon removal of a non-removable dressing/device, that pressure ulcer/injury should be considered new, and not be coded as present at the most recent SOC/ROC for M1311X2. Response F1 refers to deep tissue injury , which is defined as a purple or maroon localized area of discolored intact skin or blood- filled blister due to damage of underlying soft tissue from pressure and/or shear . The area may be preceded by tiss ue that is painful, firm, mushy, boggy, warmer, or cooler as compared to adjacent tissue. The number of pressure injuries meeting this definition should be counted to determine the response to F1. Deep tissue injury may be difficult to detect in individual s with dark skin tones . A deep tissue injury with intact skin at SOC/ROC, that becomes stageable, is considered present at the most recent SOC/ROC at the stage at which it first becomes numerically stageable. EXAMPLES - Identify \"Present at the most recent SOC/ROC\" to answer M1311 at Discharge 1. Deep Tissue Injury (DTI) with intact skin at a SOC assessment becomes numerically stageable The RN assesses Mr. J's skin at the SOC and identifies a DTI with intact skin on his left heel. This DTI remains unchanged until the RN skin assessment 10 days later, which reveals open skin presenting as a Stage 3 pressure ulcer. The pressure ulcer does not change for the remainder of the episode. At the discharge ( DC) skin assessment, the ulcer remains a Stage 3. ( In thi s example, there are no other pressure ulcers/injuries at the SOC assessment , during the episode or at DC). Coding : On the DC assessment, M1311B1, Number of Stage 3 pressure ulcers, would be coded \"1\". M1311B2, Number of these Stage 3 pressure ulcers that were present at the most recent SOC/ROC would be coded \"1\". M1311F1, Number of unstageable pressure injuries presenting as would be c oded \" 0\". (Skip M1311F2). Rationale : At the DC assessment, Mr. J had one Stage 3 pressure ulcer, and zero unstageable pressure injuries presenting as DTI . The Stage 3 pressure ulcer observed on the DC skin assessment is reported \"present at the most recent SOC/ROC \" because that is the stage at which the DTI observed at the SOC assessment first became numerically stageable. 2. Deep tissue injury (DTI) with intact skin at SOC, becomes numerically stageable and increases in numeric al stage by discharge ( DC) The RN completes a skin assessment during the SOC visit for Mrs. K, and identifies a right hip DTI with intact skin. This DTI is first numerically stageable 10 days later as a Stage 3 pressure ulcer and increases in numerical stage five days after that, to a Stage 4 pressure ulcer. The pressure ulcer remains a Stage 4 at DC. Coding : On the DC assessment M1311C1, Number of Stage 4 pressure ulcers, would be coded \"1\". M1311C2, Number of these Stage 4 pressure ulcers that were present at the most recent SOC/ROC, would be coded \" 0\". M1311F1, unstageable pressure injuries presenting as DTI, would be coded \"0\". (Skip M1311F2). OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3: Section F - Integumentary OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chapter 3: F -11 Rationale: The DTI with intact skin observed on the SOC skin assessment first became numerically stageable as a Stage 3. Because the Stage 3 pressure ulcer increased in numerical stage to a Stage 4 by the DC assessment, the Stage 4 pressure ulcer at DC is considered new, and not co ded as present at the most recent SOC/ROC . 3. Deep Tissue Injury (DTI) with intact skin at SOC, becomes numerically stageable, then is unstageable due to slough and/or eschar at DC The RN assesses Mr. L's skin during the assessment timeframe for the SOC, and identifies a DTI with intact skin on his right heel. This DTI first becomes numerically stageable at the third home visit, as a Stage 3 pressure ulcer. At the DC skin assessment, this pressure ulcer is unstageable due to slough and eschar. Coding: On the DC assessment, M1311E1, number unstageable pressure ulcers due to would be coded \"1\". M1311E2, number of these unstageable pressure ulcers that were pres ent at the most recent SOC/ROC, would be coded \"0\". M1311F1, unstageable pressure injuries presenting as DTI, would be coded \"0\". (Skip M1311F2). Rationale: The DTI with intact skin observed on the SOC skin assessment first became stageable as a Stage 3 pressure ulcer. This ulcer did not remain a Stage 3, however. At the DC skin assessment the ulcer was observed to be unstageable due to slough and eschar. Any pressure ulcer/injury that is observed to be unstageable due to slough and/or eschar, but was prev iously numerically stageable, is considered new, and not coded as present at the most recent SOC/ROC .

Please note; pressure ulcers /injuries that have healed are not considered for this item. TIME POINTS ITEM(S) COMPLETED Start of Care Resumption of Care Follow -up Discharge from agency - not to an inpatient facility RESPONSE- SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS Terminology referring to \"healed\" vs. \"unhealed\" ulcers can refer to whether the ulcer is \"closed\" vs. \"open\". Recognize, however, that Stage 1 pressure injuries and Deep Tissue Injury (DTI), although closed (intact skin), would not be considered healed. U nstageable pressure ulcers /injuries , whether covered with a non- removable dressing or eschar or slough, would not be considered healed. Determine which pressure ulcer(s) /injur (ies) are stageable or Unstageable. A pressure ulcer /injury is considered Unstageable if: - it is covered with a non-removable dressing/ device , such as a cast , that cannot be removed. - it presents as a deep tissue injury, or - the wound bed is obscured by some degree of necrotic tissue AND no bone, muscle, tendon, or joint capsule (Stage 4 structures) are visible. Note that if a Stage 4 structure is visible, the pressure ulcer is reportable as a Stage 4 even if slough or eschar is present. Determine which stageable pressure ulcer is the most problematic. - \"Most problematic\" may be the largest, the most advanced stage, the most difficult to access for treatment, the most difficult to relieve pressure, etc., depending on the specific situation. - If the patient has only one stageable pressure ulcer, then that ulcer is the mo st problematic. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3: Section F - Integumentary OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chapter 3: F -14 RESPONSE- SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS (cont'd for OASIS ITEM M1324) Enter the response that most accurately describes the stage of the most problematic stageable pressure ulcer /injury using the definitions of Stage in M1311. Enter \"NA\" if the patient has NO pressure ulcers or only has pressure ulcers that are Unstageable as defined above. - Do not reverse stage pressure ulcers as a way to document healing as it does not accurately characterize what is physiologically occurring as the ulcer heals. For example, over time, even though a Stage 4 pressure ulcer has been healing and contracting such that it is less deep, wide, and long, the tissues that were lost (muscle, fat, dermis) will never be replaced with the same type of tissue. Unless it become s unstageable, c linical standards require that a Stage 4 pressure ulcer continue to be documented as a Stage 4 pressure ulcer until it has healed. - If a pressure ulcer is Stage 4 at SOC and is granulating at the Follow -up Assessment , the ulcer remains a Stage 4 ulcer.

Enter Code 0 No [Go to M1400] 1 Yes, patient has at least one observable surgical wound 2 Surgical wound known but not observable due to non-removable dressing/device [Go to M1400] ITEM INTENT Identifies the presence of a wound resulting from a surgical procedure. TIME POINTS ITEM(S) COMPLETED Start of care Resumption of care Follow -up Discharge from agency - not to inpatient facility RESPONSE- SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS Old surgical wounds that have resulted in scar or keloid formation are not considered current surgical wounds and should not be included in this item. If the patient has both an observable and an unobservable wound, the best response is 1 - Yes, patient has at least one observable surgical wound. Enter Response 2 if the only surgical wound(s) is/are not observable. A wound is considered not observable if it is covered by a dressing/device, such as a cast, which is not to be removed per physician order. For the purpose of this OASIS item, a surgical site closed primarily (with sutures, staples, or a chemical bonding agent) is generally described in documentation as a surgical wound until re-epithelialization has been present for approximately 30 days, unless it dehisces or presents signs of infection. After 30 days, it is generally described as a scar and should not be included in this item. The incision line would be considered the surgical wound. The staple or suture sites are not considered as surgical wounds f or M1340. If a pressure ulcer is surgically closed with a flap or graft it is no longer reported as a pressure ulcer. It should be reported as a surgical wound until healed. If the flap or graft fails, it should continue to be considered a surgical wound u ntil healed. A bowel ostomy is excluded as a surgical wound, unless a \"take-down\" procedure of a previous bowel ostomy is performed, in which case the surgical take-down produces a surgical wound. A bowel ostomy being allowed to close on its own is excluded as a surgical wound. All other ostomies are excluded from consideration under this item and should not be counted as surgical wounds. There are many types of \"ostomies,\" all of which involve a surgically formed opening from outside the body to an interna l organ or cavity. Examples include cystostomy, urostomy, thoracostomy, tracheostomy, gastrostomy, etc. Orthopedic (centrally -inserted venous catheters), stapled or sutured incisions, and wounds with drains are all considered surgical wounds. Medi -port sites and other implanted infusion devices or venous access devices are considered surgical wounds. A PICC line (peripherally -inserted venous catheter), either tunneled or non-tunneled, is NOT a surgical wound, when it is periph erally inserted. Cataract surgery of the eye, surgery to the mucosal membranes, or a gynecological surgical procedure via a vaginal approach does not create a surgical wound for the purpose of this item.

Determine status of the most problematic surgical wound using healing status definitions developed by the Wound Ostomy and Continence Nurses (WOCN) Society. The clinician must first assess if the wound i s healing entirely by primary intention (well -approximated with no dehiscence), or if there is a portion healing by secondary intention, (due to dehiscence, interruption of the incision, or intentional secondary healing). - Surgical wounds healing by primary intention (approximated incisions) do not granulate, therefore the only appropriate responses would be Response 0 - \"Newly epithelialized\" or Response 3 - \"Not healing\". If the wound is healing solely by primary intention, observe if the incision line has re- epithelialized. Epithelialization is regeneration of the epidermis across a wound surface. (If there is no interruption in the healing process, this generally takes within a matter of hours to three days post - operatively.) If there is not full epitheli al resurfacing such as in the case of a scab adhering to underlying tissue, the correct response would be \"Not healing\" for the wound healing exclusively by primary intention. A surgical incision would not automatically be considered 3 - Not healing solely due to the presence of staples.

A ssessment strategies: Review the urinary elimination pattern as you take the health history . Does the patient admit having difficulty controlling the urine, or is he/she embarrassed about needing to wear a pad so as not to wet on clothing? Do you have orders to change a catheter? Is your stroke patient using an external catheter? Be alert for an odor of urine, which might indicate there is a problem with bladder sphincter control. If the patient receives aide services for bathing and/or dressing, ask for input from the aide (at follow -up assessment) . This information can then be discussed with the patient . Urinary incontinence may result from multiple cause s, including physiologic reasons, cognitive impairments, or mobility problems .

TIME POINTS ITEM(S) COMPLETED Start of c are Resumption of c are RESPONSE- SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS The drug regimen review includes all medications, prescribed and ov er the counter (OTC) including nutritional supplements, vitamins and herbals, administered by any route (for example, oral, topical, sublingual and by infusion). The drug regimen review also includes total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and oxygen. Potential or actual clinically significant medication issues may i nclude, but are not limited to, the following: adverse reactions to medications (such as a rash) ineffective drug therapy ( such as analgesic that does not reduce pain) side effects ( such as potential bleeding from an anticoagulant) drug interactions ( such as seri ous drug-drug, drug-food and drug-disease interactions) duplicate therapy ( such as generic name and brand name equivalent drugs are both prescribed) omissions ( such as missing drugs from a prescribed regimen) dosage errors (either too high or too low) nonadherence ( purposeful or accidental) Any of the circumstances listed above mu st reach a level of c linical significance that warrants notification of the physician/physician-designee for orders or recommendations by midnight of the next calendar day, at the latest. Any circumstance that does not require this immediate at tention is not considered a potential or actual clinically significant medication issue for the purpose of the drug regimen review items. The drug regimen review is part of the comprehensive patient as sessment. The comprehensive patient assessment is the responsibility of and must ultimately be completed by one clinician , but collaboration is allowed. Agency policy and practice will determine this process and how it is documented. DEFINITION DRUG REGI MEN REVIEW The drug regimen review in post -acute care is generally considered to include medication reconciliation, a review of all medications a patient is currently using and review of the drug regimen to identify, and if possible, prevent potential clinically significant medication issues. DEFINITION POT ENTIAL OR ACTUAL CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT MEDICATION ISSUE A clinically significant medication issue is a potential or actual issue that, in the clinician's professional judgment, warrants physician (or physician- designee) communication and completion of prescribed/recommended actions by midnight of the next calendar day (at the latest). OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3: Section L - Medications OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chapter 3: L-2 RESPONSE- SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS (cont 'd for OASIS ITEM M2001) For example, for this drug regimen review item, collaboration in which the assessing clinician evaluates patient status (for example, presence of potent ial ineffective drug therapy or patient nonadherence), and another clinician (in the office) assists with review of the medication list (for example, possible duplicate drug therapy or omissions) is allowed. If portions of the drug regimen review (for example, identification of potential drug-drug interactions or potential dosage errors) are completed by agency staff other than the clinician responsible for completing the SOC/ROC OASIS, information on drug regimen review findings must be communicated to the assessing clinician responsible for the SOC/ROC OASIS assessment so that the appropriate response for M2001 may be entered. The M0090 date assessment completed will indicate the last day the clinician gathered or received any input used to complete the comprehensive assessment document, which includes the OASIS items. Coding Instructions: Code 0, No, No issues found during review, if, based on assessing clinician' s professional judgment, no potential or actual clinically significant issues are identified. Examples may include, but are not limited to: Patient 's inpatient facility discharge medication list matches medications patient has on hand. Patient has a plan for taking medications safely at the right time. Patient is not showing signs/symptoms that could be adverse reactions caused by medications . The diagnoses/conditions for which the patient is taking the medications appear adequately controlled. C ode 1 , Yes, issues found during review if a drug regimen review is conducted upon SOC/ROC and based on assessing clinician' s professional judgment, potential or actual clinically significant medication issues are identified. Examples may include, but are not limited to: Patient 's list of medications from the inpatient facility discharge instructions DO NOT match the medications the patient shows the clinician at the SOC/ROC assessment visit. Assessment shows that diagnoses/symptoms for which the patient is taking medications are NOT adequately controlled. Patient seems confused about when/how to take medications indicating a high risk for medication errors. Patient has not obtained medications or indicates that s/he will not take prescribed medications because of financial, access, cultural, or other issues with medications . Patient has signs/symptoms that could be adverse reactions from medications. Patient takes multiple non-prescribed medications (OTCs, herbals) that could interact with prescribed medications. Patient has a complex medication plan with medications prescribed by multiple physicians and/or obtained from multiple pharmacies so that the risk of drug interactions is high. Co de 9, NA - Patient is not taking any medications, if a drug regimen review indicates there are no medications prescribed for the patient and the patient is not taking any medications, by any route, at the time of the assessment. A dash is a valid response for this item. CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. If elements of the drug regimen review were skipped, (for example drug-to -drug interactions were not completed), a dash ( -) should be reported, indicating the drug regimen review was not completed. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3: Section L - Medications OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chapter 3: L-3 EXAMPLES 1. No issues identified During the comprehensive assessment visit to Mr. K ., the PT reviews all the patient 's medications and identifies no problems except that the patient 's newly prescribed pain medication is not in the home. The daughter , Nancy, states they were only going to pick it up from the pharmacy if \"the pain got bad enough. \" The PT reviews the physician' s instructions for the new medication with the Mr. K and Nancy; they agree the medication should be on hand, and to follow physician' s instructions for administration . Prior to the PT leaving the home, the daughter has gone to the drugstore and returned with the medication. Coding: M2001 would be code d 0, No - No issues found during review . Rationale: Because the issue, in the PT 's professional judgment, did not require physician (or physician- designee ) contact by midnight of the next calendar day , at the latest to resolve, it does not meet the criteria for a potential or actual clinically significant medication issue. 2. Drug regimen review (DRR) not complete; use of the dash During the SOC comprehensive assessment, Nurse Richard completes all elements of the DRR except for checking for drug -drug interactions. Coding: M2001, enter a dash, \"-\" Rationale: When any element is not assessed, the DRR is considered incomplete.

Examples : Clinician did not communicate all clinically significant medication issues to physician/physician- designee until after midnight of the next calendar day . Clinician communicated all clinically significant medication issues to physician/physician- designee by midnight of the next calendar day, but the clinician did not receive a response from the physician/physician-designee to communicate prescribed/recommended actions until after midnight of the next calendar day. Clinician did not complete all physician/physician - designee prescribed/recommended actions until after midnight of the nex t calendar day. DEFINITIONS CONTACT W ITH PHYSICIAN / PHYSICIAN DESIGNEE Communication to the physi cian/ physician -designee to convey an identified potential or actual clinically significant medication issue, AND a response from the physician/physician- designee to acknowledge receipt and/or convey prescribed/recommended actions in response to the medication issue.

MEDIC ATION FOLLOW-UP The process of contacting a physician/physician-designee to communicate the identified medication issue and, to the extent possib le, completing all physician/physician-designee prescribed/recommended actions by midnight of the next calendar day (at the latest). Code 1, Yes, if the two -way communication AND completion of the prescribed/recommended actions to the extent possible occurred by midnight of the next calendar day after the potential clinically significant medication issue was identified. Examples : Clinician communicated all identified clinically s ignificant medication issue to the physician/physician- designee, and all physician/physician-designee prescribed/recommended actions for all identified medication issues were completed by midnight of the next calendar day. Clinician contacted the physician/physician-designee r egarding all identified medication issues, and the physician/physician-designee communicated to the clinician that no actions were necessary regarding the reported issues. All communications took place before midnight of the next calendar day. If the physician/physician -designee recommends an ac tion that will take longer than the allowed time to complet e, then Response 1 - Yes should be entered as long as by midnight of the next calendar day the agency has taken whatever actions are possible to comply with the recommended actio n. An example of a recommended action that would take longer than the allowed time to complete might include physician order(s) for intervention followed by monitoring the issue over the weekend and call if problem persists, or the physician instructs the patient to address the concern with his PCP on a visit that is scheduled in two days . The actual type of actions recommended should be considered in determining if the agency has taken whatever actions are possible by midnight of the next calendar day.

OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3: Section L - Medications OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chapter 3: L-6 EXAMPLE 1. Clinically significant m edication issue identified, with follow -up During the SOC comprehensive assessment visit, the RN completes a drug regimen review and identifies that the patient is taking two antihypertensives; one which was newly prescribed during her recent hospital stay, and another that she was taking prior to her hospitalization. During the home visit, the RN contacts the physician' s office, and leaves a message with office staff providing notification of the potential duplicative drug therapy and a request for clarification. The next day, the RN returns to the home to complete the comprehensive assessment and again contacts the physician from the patient 's home. The physician 's office nurse reports to the agency and patient that the physician would like the patient to continue with only the newly prescribed antihypertensive and discontinue the previous medication. Coding: M2001, Drug Regimen Review, would be coded 1, Yes, Issues found during review. M2003, Medication Follow -up, would be coded 1, Yes. Rationale: Because the issue identified was determined by the clinician to be clinically significant, requiring physician contact by midnight of the next calendar day, it meets the criteria for a potential clinically significant medication issue (M2001) . As the clinically significant issue was communicated to the physician and the prescribed/recommended action was completed by midnight of the next calendar day, M2003 would be coded 1 - Yes.

A dash (- ) value is a valid response for this item. CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. EXAMPLES 1. No clinically significant medication issues identified throughout the episode During the Discharge assessment visit, the RN reviews the patient 's medication list and confirms that no potential clinically significant medication issues are present. In reviewing the clinical record, there is documentation that a drug regimen review was conducted at SOC , and no potential clinically significant medication issues were identified. There is no other documentation to indicate that potential or actual clinically significant medication issues occurred during the episode of care. Coding : M2005: ENTER Response 9 (NA) - There were no potential clinically significant medication issues identified since SOC/ROC or patient is not taking any medications. Rationale: This item is reported as NA because there is documentation that the agency looked for potential clinically significant medication issues via completion of a drug regimen review and that no potential or actual clinically significant medication issues were identified at any time during the episode, from SOC through Discharge. 2. Clinically significant medication issue identified, late follow -up During the SOC comprehensive assessment, the RN completes the drug regimen review and identifies a potential clinically significant medication issue. On that day of admission, the RN calls and leaves a message with the physician 's office related to the medication issue. The physician does not return her call until after midnight of the next calendar day. No other medication issues arise during the episode, and the patient is discharged from home health. Coding : At SOC : M2001: ENTER Response 1 - Yes - Issues found during review. M2003: ENTER Response 0 - No. At DC: M2005: enter Response 0 - No. Rationale: Because an issue identified was determined by the clinician to be clinically significant, warranting physician contact by midnight of the next calendar day, it meets the criteria for a clinically significant medication issue (1 - Yes for M2001). While the clinician initiated communication with the physician, the required two-way communication did not occur until after midnight of the next calendar day, resulting in 0 - No responses for M2003 and M2005.

Enter Response 2 if daily reminders to take medications are necessary, regardless of whether the patient is independent or needs assistance in preparing individual doses (for example, setting up a \" planner device\") and/or developing a drug diary or chart . (Reminders provided by a device that the patient can independently set up and manage are not considered \" assistance \" or \"reminders. \") If a medication is ordered PRN and the medication is needed by the patient on the day of assessment - and the patient needed a reminder to take this PRN medication on the day of assessment, Enter Response 2. If the patient did not need any PRN medications on the day of the assessment and therefore no reminders were necessary, assess the patient 's ability on all of the medications taken on the day of assessment. Enter Response 3 if the patient does not have the physical or cognit ive ability on the day of assessment to take all medications correctly (right medication, right dose, right time) as ordered and every time ordered, and it has not been established (and therefore the clinician cannot assume) that set up, diary, or reminder s have already been successful . The clinician would need to return to assess if the new interventions, such as reminders or a med planner, provided adequate support for the patient to take all medications safely. If the patient 's ability to manage oral medications varies from medication to medication, consider the medication for which the most assistance is needed when selecting a response. For a patient residing in an assisted living facility where the facility holds and administers medications, M2020 should continue to report the patient 's ability to take the correct oral medication(s) and proper dosage(s) at the correct times.

These items address the patient 's ability to safely manage injectable medications, given the current physical and mental/emotional/cognitive status, activities permitted, and environment . The patient must be viewed from a holistic perspective in assessing ability to perform medication management . Ability can be temporarily or permanently limited by: physical impairments (for example, limited manual dexterity) ; emotional/cognitive/behavioral impairments (for example, memory deficits, impaired judgment, fear) ; sensory impairments (for example, impaired vision, pain) ; environmental barriers (for example, access to kitchen or medication storage area, stairs, narrow doorway . TIME POINTS ITEM(S) COMPLETED Start of care Resumption of care Follow -up RESPONSE- SPECIFI C INSTRUCTIONS Excludes IV medications, infusions (for example, medications given via a pump), and medications given in the physician 's office or other settings outside the home. Includes one-time injections administered in the home. Includes assessment of the patient 's ability to obtain the medication from where it is routinely stored, draw up the correct dose accurately using aseptic technique, inject in an appropriate site using correct technique, and dispose of the syringe properly. Enter Response 0 if the patient sets up her/his own individual doses and is able to take the correct medication in the correct dosage at the correct time as a result of this . Enter Response 1 for a patient independent in injectable medication administration if another person must prepare individual doses and/or if another person must develop a drug diary or chart. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3: Section L - Medications OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chapter 3: L- 16 RESPONSE- SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS (cont'd for OASIS Item M2030) Enter Response 2 if reminders to take medications are necessary, regardless of the whether the patient is independent or needs assistance in preparing individual doses and/or developing a drug diary or chart . (Reminders provided by a device that the patient can independently manage are not considered \"assistance\" or \"reminders. \") Enter Response 3 if the physician ordered the RN to administer an injection in the home. If the patient 's ability to manage injectable medications varies from medication to medication, consider the medication for which the most assistance is needed when selecting a response. PRN injectables, ordered and included on POC, are to be considered when determining the patient 's ability to manage injectable medications. If the PRN medication was not needed during the assessment timeframe, use clinical judgment and make an inference regarding the patient 's ability by asking them to describe and demonstrate the steps for administration and needle disposal, considering the patient 's cognitive and physical status as well as any other barriers. Assessment strategies: A combined observation/interview approach with the patient or caregiver is helpful in determining the most accurate response for this item . Observe patient preparing the injectable medications . If it is not time for the medication, ask the patient to describe and demonstrate the steps for administration. The cognitive/mental status and functional assessments contribute to determining the appropriate response for this item. For a patient residing in an assisted living facility where the facility holds and administers medications, M2030 should continue to report the patient 's ability to administer all injectable medication(s) reliably and safely at the correct times . When medications are stored by the facility, use clinical judgment and make an inference regarding the patient 's ability by asking the patient to describe and demonstrate the steps for administration and needle disposal, considering the patient 's cognitive and physical status as well as any other barriers.

OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3: Section M - Care Management OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chapter 3: M-3 RESPONSE- SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS (cont'd for OASIS ITEM M2102 ) For each row, enter one des c ription of caregiver assistance. If patient needs assistance with any aspect of a category of assistance (such as needs assistance with some IADLs but not others), consider the aspect that represents the most need. If more than one response represents the non-agency caregiver 's ability to provide assistance, select the response that represents the caregiver 's greatest barrier to meet the need. For example, the caregiver provides assistance but also needs training or support. In this example, report that the caregiver needs training/supportive services to provide assistance, because it represents the caregiver 's greatest barrier to meeting the patient 's need. Enter Response 3 if: - Non-agency Caregiver(s) are not likely to provide care due to an unwillingness and/or inability on the part of the non-agency caregiver(s); and/or if there is a reluctance on the part of the non- agency caregiver(s) to provide care. Row a - ADLs include basic self -care activities such as the examples listed. Ro w c - Medication administration refers to any type of medication (prescribed or OTC) and any route of administration including oral, inhalant, injectable, topical, or adminis tration via g-tube/j -tube, etc. Row d - Medical procedures/treatments include procedures/treatments that the physician or physician - designee has ordered for the purpose of improving health status . Some examples of these procedures/treatments include wound care and dressing changes, range of motion exercises, intermittent urinary catheterization, postural dr ainage, electromodalities, etc. De vices such as anti -embolism stockings, prosthetic devices, orthotic devices, or other supports that have a medical and/or therapeutic impact should be consid ered medical procedures/treatments, not as ADL/dressing items in Row a. Ro w f - Supervision and safety includes needs related to the ability of the patient to safely remain in the home. This category of assistance needs should focus on supervision and safety necessary due to cognitive or mental health issues. Such assistance may range from calls to remind the forgetful patient to take medications, to in- person visits to ensure that a patient with impaired decision making is safe, to the need for the physical presence of another person in the home to ensure that the patient doesn' t wander, harm themselves or others or to monitor other safety risks related to cognitive/mental health concerns .

(Enter zero [\"000\"] if no therapy visits indicated.) ( ) Number of therapy visits indicated (total of physical, occupational and speech-language pathology combined). NA - Not Applicable: No case mix group defined by this assessment . ITEM INTENT I dentifies the total number of therapy visits (physical, occupational, or speech therapy combined) planned for the Medicare payment episode for which this assessment will determine the case mix group, and only applies to payers utilizing a payment model based on case mix group assignment. TIME POINTS ITEM(S) COMPLETED St art of care R esumption of care F ollow -up RESPONSE- SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS T herapy visits must (a) relate directly and specifically to a treatment regimen established by the physician through consultation with the therapist(s), and (b) be reasonable and necessary to the treatment of the patient 's illness or injury . The Medicare payment episode ordinarily comprises 60 days beginning with the start of care date, or 60 days beginning with the recertification date. E nter a number that is \"zero filled and right justifi ed.\" For example, 11 visits should be reported as \"011. \" En ter \"000 \" if no therapy services are needed. O nce patient eligibility has been confirmed and the Plan of Care contains physician orders for the qualifying service as well as other Medicare covered home health services, the qualifying service does not have to be rendered prior to the other Medicare covered home health services ordered in the Plan of Care. The sequence of visits performed by the disciplines must be dictated by the individual patient 's Plan of Ca re. For example, an eligible patient in an initial 60 -day episode that has both physical therapy and occupational therapy orders in the Plan of Care, the sequence of the delivery of the type of therapy is irrelevant as long as the need for the qualifying service is established prior to the delivery of other Medicare covered services and the qualifying discipline provides a billable visit prior to transfer or discharge in accordance with the Conditions of Participation. F or multidisciplinary cases - Nursing and Therapy may collaborate to answer this item correctly . The PT, OT, and/or SLP are responsible to communicate the number of visits ordered by the physician to the RN completing this item . Coordination of patient care is specified in the Conditions of Participation. W hen a patient is discharged home from an inpatient facility admission in the last five days of a certification period (the requirement to complete a Resumption of Care assessment overlaps with the requirement to complete a Recertification assessment), CMS allows the agency to complete a single ROC assessment to meet the requirements of both time points . In such cases, the total number of therapy visits planned for the upcoming 60 -day episode should be reported in M2200.

Usually, the \"NA \" response will be checked for patients whose payment source is not Medicare fee-for -service (that is, M0150, Response 1 is not checked), or for an assessment that will not be used to determine a Medicare case mix group. However, payers other than the Medicare program may use this information in setting an episode payment rate. If the HHA needs a case mix code (HIPPS code) for billing purposes, a response other than \"NA \" - Not Applicable is required to generate the case mix code. A ssessment strategies: When the assessment and care plan are complete, review the Plan of Care to determine whether therapy services are ordered by the physician . If not, enter \"000.\" If therapy services are ordered, how many total visits are indicated over the 60- day payment episode? If the number of visits that will be needed is uncertain, provide your best estimate.

This item includes current events. TIME POINTS ITEM(S) COMPLETED Transfer to an inpatient facility Discharge from agency - not to an inpatient facility RESPONSE- SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS This item excludes urgent care services not provided in a hospital emergency department, including care provided at doctor 's office, care provided by an ambulance crew, or care received in urgent care facilities. This item includes holding and observation only in the hospital emergency department setting. - An urge nt care facility is defined as a freestanding walk -in clinic (not a depart ment of a hospital) for patients in need of immediate medical care. Urgent care centers treat many problems that can be seen in a primary care physician' s office, but urgent care centers offer some services that are generally not available in primary care physician offices. For example, X-ray facilities allow for treatment of minor fractures and foreign bodies, such as nail gun injuries. Most urgent care centers offer extended hours in evenings and on weekends for patients to receive treatment when their personal physician is not available. If a patient went to a hospital emergency department, regardless of whether the patient/caregiver independently made the decision to seek emergency department services or was advised to go the emergency department by the physician, home health agency, or other health care provider, then Response 1 or 2 should be entered depending on whether or not a hospital admission occurred. If a patient went to a hospital emergency department, was \"held \" at the hospital for observation, then released, the patient did receive emergent care. The time period that a patient can be \"held\" without admission can vary. \"Holds \" can be longer than 23 hours but emergent care should be reported regardless of the length of the observation \"hold. \" An OASIS transfer assessment is not required if the patient was never actually admitted to an inpatient facility. If a patient went to a hospital emergency department and was subsequently admitted to the hospital, enter Respon se 2. An OASIS transfer assessment is required (assuming the inpatient stay was for 24 hours or longer, and for reasons other than diagnostic testing). OAS IS Guidance Manual Chapter 3: Section O - Emergent Care OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/ 2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chapter 3: O -2 RESPONSE- SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS (cont 'd for OASIS Item M2301) If a patient is admitted to the hospital for a stay requiring an OASIS Transfer, Response 0 - No, should only be entered if the patient was directly admitted to the hospital (was not treated or evaluated in the emergency room), and had no other emergency d epartment visits at or since the most recent SOC/ROC assessment. Enter Response 1- Yes, used hospital emergency department WITHOUT hospital admission for a patient who, at the time of or at any time since the most recent SOC/ROC, accessed a hospital emerge ncy department that did not result in an admission to the hospital. If a patient utilized a hospital emergency department more than once at the time of or at any time since the most recent SOC/ROC, enter Response 2 - Yes, used hospital emergency with hospital admission if any emergency department visit at or since the most recent SOC/ROC resulted in hospital admission. If no admission, enter Response 1. In Responses 1 and 2, \"hospital admission\" is defined as admission to a hospital where the inpatient stay is for 24 hours or longer, and for reasons other than diagnostic testing. A patient who dies in a hospital emergency department is considered to have been under the care of the emergency department, not the home health agency. In this situation, a Transfer assessment, not an assessment for \"Death at Home, \" should be completed.

Examples: homemaking services under Medicaid waiver programs, personal care services provided by a home health agency, paid assistance provided by an individual, home-delivered meals provided by organizations like Meals -on-Wheels. - Ther apy services provided in an outpatient setting would not be considered formal assistance. Info rmal services are provided by friends, family, neighbors, or other individuals in the community for which no financial compensation is provided. Examples: assistance with ADLs provided by a family member, transportation provided by a friend, meals provided by church members (specifically, meals not provided by the church organization itself, but by individual volunteers). Noni nstitutional hospice is defined as the patient receiving hospice care at home or a caregiver 's home, not in an inpatient hospice facili ty.

OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3 Section GG Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- D Guidance Manual Chapter 3: GG-8 Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Item Intent This item identifies the patient's ability to perform the listed self -care acti vities, and discharge goal(s). Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of care Resumption of care Follow-up Discharge from agency - not to an inpatient facility Note: This item, GG0130, includes Performance assessment and Discharge Goal(s) at the SOC/ROC . Refer to sections for instructions, tips and examples for each . Response -Specific Instructions - Performance Assessment (SOC/ROC, FU and DC) Licensed clinicians may assess the patient 's performance based on direct observation (preferred) as well as reports from the patient, clinicians, care staff, and/or family . When possible, CMS invites a multidisciplinary approach to patient assessment. Patients should be allowed to perform activities as independently as possible, as long as they are safe. If helper assistance is required because patient 's performance is unsafe or of poor quality, score according to amount of assistance provided. Activities may be completed with or without assistive device(s). Use of assistive device(s) to complete an activity should not affect coding of the activity. Patients with cognitive impairments/limitations may need physical and/or verbal assistance when co mpleting an activity. Code based on the patient' s need for assistance to perform the activity safely (for example, choking risk due to rate of eating, amount of food placed into mouth, risk of falling). Response -Specific Instructions - SOC/ROC Performance Assessment Code the patient's functional status based on a functional assessment that occurs at or soon after the patient 's SOC/ROC. The SOC/ROC function scores are to reflect the patient 's SOC/ROC baseline status and are to be based on observation of activities, to the extent possible. When possible, t he assessment should occur prior to the start of therapy services to capture the patient 's true baseline status. This is because therapy interventions can affect the patient 's functional status . OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3 Section GG Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- D Guidance Manual Chapter 3: GG-9 Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services A patient 's functional ability can be impacted by the e nvironment or situations encountered in the home. Observing the patient in different locations and circumstances within the home is important for a comprehensive understanding of the patient' s functional status. If the patient 's ability varies during the assessment timeframe , record their usual ability to perform each activity. Do not record the patient 's best performance and do not record the patient's worst performance, but rather the patient 's usual performance; what is true greater than 50% of the assessment timeframe. DEFINITION ASSESSMENT TIMEFRAME The assessment timeframe is the maximum number of days within which to complete the comprehensive assessment. Response -Specific Instructions - SOC/ROC Discharge Goal(s) For the Home Health (HH) Quality Reporting Prog ram (QRP) a minimum of one self -care or mobility goal must be coded. However, agencies may choose to complete more than one self -care or mobility discharge goal. Code the patient's discharge goal(s) using the 6- point scale. Use of the activity not attempted codes (07, 09, 10 or 88) is permissible to code discharge goal(s) . Use of a dash is permissible for any remaining self -care or mobility goals that were not coded. Discharge goal(s) may be the coded the same as SOC/ROC performance, higher than SOC/ROC performance or lower than SOC/ROC performance. If the SOC/ROC performance of an activity was coded using one of the activity not attempted codes (07, 09, 10 or 88) a discharge goal may be submitted using th e 6-point scale if the patient is expected to be able to perform the activity by discharge. Licensed clinicians can establish a patient 's discharge goal(s) at the time of SOC/ROC based on the patient's prior medical condition, SOC/ROC assessment, self- care and mobility status, discussions with the patient and family, professional judgment, the profession' s practice standards, expected treatments, patient motivation to improve, anticipated length of stay, and the discharge plan. Goals should be established as part of the patient 's care plan. DEFINITION USUAL PERFORMANCE, ABILITY A patient's usual performance is his/her ability greater than 50% of the assessment timeframe. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3 Section GG Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- D Guidance Manual Chapter 3: GG- 10 Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Response Specific Instructions - Follow -Up and Discharge Performance Follow- up Performance: Clinicians s hould code the patient' s functional status based on a functional assessment that occurs within the assessment timeframe. Discharge Performance: The discharge t ime period under consideration includes the last 5 days of care. This includes the date of the discharge visit plus the four preceding calendar days . Code the patient's functional status based on a functional assessment that occurs at or close to the time of discharge. DEFINITION TIME PERIOD UNDER CONSIDERATION The time period under consideration is the span of time for data collection and assessment. For most OASIS items this is the day of assessment. For other items, item wording or related guidance will specify the time period under consideration, such as, since the most recent SOC/ROC. Coding Ins tructions for SOC/ROC Performance and Discharge Goal(s) , and Follow -up and Discharge Performance Code 06, Independent , if the patient completes the activity by him/herself with no assistance from a helper. Code 05, Setup or Clean -up Assistance, if the helper sets up or cleans up; patient completes activity. Helper assists only prior to or following th e activity, but not during the activity. For example, the patient requires assistance cutting up food or opening container, or requires setup of hygiene item(s) or assistive device(s). Code 04, Supervision or Touching Assistance , if the helper provides ver bal cues and/or touching/steadying and/or contact guard assistance as patient completes activity. Assistance may be provided throughout the activity or intermittently. For example, the patient requires verbal cueing, coaxing, or general supervision for saf ety to complete activity; or patient may require only incidental help such as contact guard or steadying assistance during the activity. Code 03, Partial/ Moderate Assistance, if the helper does LESS THAN HALF the effort. Helper lifts, holds, or supports trunk or limbs, but provides less than half the effort. Code 02, Substantial/ Maximal Assistance, if the helper does MORE THAN HALF the effort. Helper lifts or holds trunk or limbs and provides more than half the effort. Code 01, Dependent , if the helper does ALL of the effort. Patient does none of the effort to complete the activity; or the assistance of two or more helpers is required for the patient to complete the activity. Code 07, Patient Refused , if the patient refused to complete the activity. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3 Section GG Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- D Guidance Manual Chapter 3: GG- 11 Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Code 09, Not Applicable , if the patient did not attempt to perform the activity and did not perform this activity prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury. Code 10, Not Attempted Due to Environmental Limitations , if the patient did not attempt this activity due to environmental limitations. Examples include lack of equipment, weather constraints Code 88, Not Attempted Due to Medical Condition or Safety Concerns, if the activity was not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns. A Dash is a valid response for this item. CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Coding Tips GG0130A. Eating Patient uses a gastrostomy tube (G-Tube) or total parenteral nutrition (TPN): Assistance with tube feedings or TPN is not considered when coding the item eating . If the patient does not eat or drink by mouth and relies solely on nutrition and liquids through tube feedings or TPN due to a new (recent -onset) medical condition, code GG0130A as 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety conce rns. If the patient does not eat or drink by mouth at the time of the assessment, and the patient did not eat or drink by mouth prior to the current illness, injury or exacerbation, code GG0130A as 09, Not applicable. If the patient eats and drinks by mouth, and relies partially on obtaining nutrition and liquids via tube feedings or TPN, code eating based on the amount of assistance the patient requires to eat and drink by mouth. GG0 130B. Oral Hygiene If a patient does not perform oral hygiene during home visit, determine the patient' s abilities based on the patient' s performance of similar activities during the assessment, or on patient and/or caregiver report. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3 Section GG Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- D Guidance Manual Chapter 3: GG- 12 Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Examples - Performance 1. Eating - Food Consistency Mrs. H does not have any food consistency restrictions, but often needs to swallow two or three times so that the food clears her throat due to difficulty with pharyngeal peristalsis. She requires verbal cues to use the compensatory strategy of extra swallows to clear the food. Coding: GG0130A, Eating, would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale : Mrs. H swallows all types of food consistencies and requires verbal cueing (supervision) from the helper. Code based on assistance from the helper. The coding is not based on whether the patient had restrictions related to food consistency. 2. Eating - Visual Deficit Mrs. V has difficulty seeing on her left side since her stroke. During meals, a helper must remind her to scan the entire plate to ensure she has seen all the food. Coding: GG0130A, Eating, would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: The helper provides verbal cueing assistance as Mrs. V completes the activity of eating. Supervision, such as reminders, may be provided throughout the activity or intermittently. 3. Eating - G- tube Mr. R is unable to eat or drink by mouth since he had a stroke 1 week ago. He receives nutrition and hydration through a G-tube, which is administered by a helper. Coding: GG0130A, Eating, would be coded 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns. Rationale: The patient does not eat or drink by mouth at this time due to a recent -onset medical condition ( his recent -onset stroke). This item includes eating and drinking by mouth only. 4. Oral Hygiene - Assistance to and from the Bathroom The helper provides steadying assistance to Mr. S as he walks to the bathroom. The helper applies toothpaste onto Mr. S's toothbrush. Mr. S then brushes his teeth at the sink in the bathroom without physical assistance or supervision. Once Mr. S is done brushing his teeth and washing his hands and face, the helper returns and provides steadying assistance as the patient walks back to his bed. Coding: GG0130B, Oral hygiene, would be coded 05, Setup or clean- up assistance. Rationale: The helper provides setup assistance (putting toothpaste on the toothbrush) before Mr. S brushes his teeth. Do not consider assistance provided to get to or from the bathroom to score Oral hygiene. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3 Section GG Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- D Guidance Manual Chapter 3: GG- 13 Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Examples - SOC/ROC Performance 1. SOC/ROC Performance When the Activity Did Not Occur at the Time of the Assessment, Nor Prior to the Current Illness, Injury or Exacerbation Ms. J cannot swallow any food or liquids secondary to ALS. She has a J-tube and has been on tube feedings for several years. She is being admitted to skilled home health care for treatment of a sacral pressure injury. Her treatment includes TPN to support wound healing. Coding: GG0130A1, Eating, SOC Performance would be coded, 09, Not Applicable. GG0130A2, Eating , Discharge Goal, would be coded 09, Not Applicable. Rationale: Mr. J does not eat or drink by mouth at the time of assessment, and did not eat or drink by mouth prior to the current illness, injury or exacerbation. And, Mr. J is not expected to eat or drink by mouth by discharge. 2. SOC/ROC Performance When the Activity Did Not Occur at the Time of the Assessmen t, but Did Occur Prior to the Current Illness, Injury or Exacerbation Mr. B has been prescribed bowel rest for pancreatitis, and he is not to eat or drink anything for one week, after which the home health nurse will support advancing back to a regular diet. TPN has been prescribed, and he is being admitted to home care for TPN teaching and management. Coding: GG0130A1, Eating, SOC Performance, would be coded 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns. E xamples - Establish Discharge Goal(s) at SOC/ROC 3. Discharge Goal Code is Higher than SOC /ROC Performance Code During SOC/ROC functional assessment, Mr. M states he prefers to bathe himself rather than depending on helpers or his wife to perform this activity. The clinician assesses Mr. M' s SOC/ROC performance for Shower/Bathe self, and determines the helper performs more than half the effort. The assessing clinician, using professional judgement, available information and collaboration as allowed anticipates that by discharge Mr. M will require a helper for less than half of the ac tivity Shower/Bathe self. Coding: GG0130E1, Shower/Bathe self, SOC Performance, would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. GG0130E 2 Shower/Bathe self, Discharge Goal , would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. Rationale: At SOC/ROC assessment, Mr. M participates in the activity Shower/bathe self, but a helper performs more than half the activity, the definition of substantial/maximal assistance. The assessing clinician expects Mr. M has the potential to improve in performance of this activity, to the extent that a helper needs to assist for less than half the activity, the definition for partial/moderate assistance. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3 Section GG Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- D Guidance Manual Chapter 3: GG- 14 Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 4. Discharge Goal Code is the Same as SOC/ROC Performance Code During the SOC/ROC assessment, Mrs. E states she prefers to participate in her oral hygiene twice daily. On assessment, the clinician identifies that Mrs. E 's caregiver completes more than half of this activity. Mrs. E has severe arthritis, Parkinson's disease, diabetic neuropathy, and renal failure. These conditi ons result in multiple impairments, including limited endurance, weak hand grasp, slow movements and tremors. The assessing clinician, using professional judgment, all available information and collaboration as allowed, determines that Mrs. E is not expected to progress to a higher level of functioning during the episode of care. However, the clinician anticipates that Mrs. E will be able to maintain her SOC/ROC performance level. The clinician discusses functional goals with Mrs. E and they agree maintaining functioning is a reasonable goal. Coding: GG0130B1 Oral Hygiene, SOC/ROC Performance, would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. GG0130B2, Oral Hygiene, D ischarge Goal, would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Rationale: Performance assessment revealed Mrs. E 's caregiver completes more than half the activity, Oral Hygiene, which matches Code 02, substantial/maximal assistance. Mrs. E 's condition in this example makes it unlikely that her performance of this activity will improve, but that maintenance of her current level of function is possible, so the discharge goal is coded the same as admission performance. 5. Discharge Goal Code is Lower than SOC/ROC Performance Code Mrs. T has a progressive neurological illness that affects her strength, coordination, and endurance. Mrs. T prefers to use the bedside commode for as long as possible rather than using incontinence undergarments. The helper currently supports Mrs. T while she is standing so that Mrs. T can pull down her underwear before sitting onto the bedside commode. When Mrs. T has finished voiding, she wipes her perineal area. Mrs. T then requires the helper to support her trunk while Mrs. T pulls up her underwear. The assessing clinician, using professional judgment, all available i nformation and collaboration as allowed anticipates that Mrs. T will weaken further by discharge, and while she will still be able to use the bedside commode, she will need the helper to assist with all toileting hygiene. Coding: GG0130C1, Toileting hygiene, assistance. GG0130C 2, Toileting hygiene, Discharge Goal , would be coded 02, substantial/maximal assistance. Rationale: Assessment of SOC/ROC performance of toileting hygiene demo nstrated that the helper provided less than half the effort for Mrs. T's toileting hygiene. The assessing clinician expects that by discharge, Mrs. T will need the helper to assist with more than half the effort of toileting hygiene. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3 Section GG Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- D Guidance Manual Chapter 3: GG- 15 Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 6. Discharge Goal Code Is Established for a Patient Where the Activity Was 09 - Not Applicable at SOC/ROC Mrs. D has been unable to eat or drink by mouth for several weeks, due to a large, cancerous lesion on the soft palate. A week ago, the lesion worsened becoming very painful and required surgical removal. At the SOC, she remains restricted from any oral intake, with the expected goal of progressing to small sips of water and soft foods by mouth with supervision by discharge from home health. Coding: GG0130A1, Eating, SOC Performance, would be coded 09, Not Applicable. GG0130A2, Eating, Discharge Goal, would be coded 04, Supervision or Touching Assistance. Rationale: Mrs. D does not eat or drink by mouth at the time of the SOC assessment, and did not eat or drink by mouth prior to the current illness, injury or exacerbation (the recent worsening necessitating surgery). The assessing clinician expects that by discharge, Mrs. D will be able to manage at least some food and drink by mouth, with supervision.

Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of c are Resumption of c are Follow -up Discharge from agency - not to an inpatient facility Note: This item, GG0170, includes Performance assessment and Discharge Goal(s) at SOC/ROC. Refer to sections for instructions, tips and examples for each. Response -Specific Instructions - Performance Assessment (SOC/ROC, FU and DC) Licensed clinicians may assess the patient 's performance based on direct observation (preferred) as well as reports from patient , clinicians, care staff, and/ or family. When possible, CMS invites a multidisciplinary approach to patient assessment. Patients should be allowed to perform activities as independently as possible, as long as they are safe. If helper assistance is required because the patient 's performance is unsafe or of poor quality, score according to amount of assistance provided. Activities may be completed with or without assistive d evice(s). Use of assistive device(s) to complete an activity should not affect coding of the activity. Patients with cognitive impairments/limitations may need physical assistance and/or verbal assistance when completing an activity. Code based on the patient 's need for assistance to complete an activity safely Response -Specific Instructions - SOC/ROC Performance Assessment Code the patient 's functional status based on a functional assessment that occurs a t or soon after the patient 's SOC/ROC. The SOC/ROC function scores are t o reflect the patient 's SOC/ROC baseline status, and are t o be based on observation of activities, to the extent possible . When possible, the assessment should occur prior t o the start of therapy services t o capture the patient 's true baseline status. This is because therapy interventions can affect the patient 's functional status. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3 Section GG Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- D Guidance Manual Chapter 3: GG- 22 Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services DEFINITION ASSESSMENT TIMEFRAME The assessment timeframe is the maximum number of days within which to complete the comprehensive assessment. DEFINITION USUAL PERFORMANCE, ABILITY A patient's usual performance is his/her ability greater than 50% of the assessment timeframe. A patient 's functional ability can be impacted by the environment or situations encountered in the home. Observing the patient in different locations and circumstances within the home is important for a comprehensive understanding of the patient 's functional status. If the patient 's ability varies during the assessment timeframe, record their usual ability to perform each activity. Do not record the patient 's best performance and do not record the patient 's worst performance, but rather the patient 's usual performance; what is true greater than 50% of the assessment timeframe. Response -Specific Instructions - SOC/ROC Discharge Goal(s) For the Home Health ( HH) Quality Reporting Program (QRP) a minimum of one self -care or mobility discharge goal must be coded. However, agencies may choose to complete more than one self -care or mobility discharge goal. Code the patient 's discharge goal(s) using the 6-point scale. Use of the activity not attempted codes (07, 09, 10 or 88) is permissible to code discharge goal(s). Use of a dash is permissible for any remaining self -care or mobility goals that were not coded . Discharge goal(s) may be coded the same as SOC/ROC performance, higher than SOC/ROC performance, or lower than SOC/ROC performance (See Examples). If the SOC/ROC performance of an activity was coded using one of the activity not attempted codes (07, 09, 10 or 88), a discharge goal may be submitted using the 6- point scale if the patient is expected to be able to perform the activity by discharge. Licensed clinicians can establish a patient 's discharge goal(s) at the time of SOC/ROC based on the patient 's prior medical condition, SOC/ROC assessment , self -care and mobility status, discussions with the patient and family, professional judgment, the profession' s practice standards, expected treatments, patient motivat ion to improve, anticipated length of stay, and the discharge plan. Goals should be established as part of the patient 's care plan. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3 Section GG Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- D Guidance Manual Chapter 3: GG- 23 Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services DEFINITION TIME PERIOD UNDER CONSIDERATION The time period under consideration is the span of time for data collection and assessment. For most OASIS items this is the day of assessment. For other items, item wording or related guidance will specify the time period under consideration, such as, since the most recent SOC/ROC. Response -Specific Instructions - Follow -Up and Discharge Performance Follow -up Performance : Clinicians should code the patient 's functional status based on a functional assessment that occurs within the assessment timeframe. Discharge Performance : The discharge time period under consideration i ncludes the last 5 days of care. This includes the date of the discharge visit plus the four preceding calendar days. Code the patient 's functional status based on a functional assessment that occurs at or close to the time of discharge. Coding Instructions Code 06, Independent , if the patient completes the activity by him/herself with no assistance from a helper. Code 05, Setup or clean- up assistance, if the helper sets up or cleans up; patient completes activity. Helper assists only prior to or following the activity, but not during the activity. For example, the patient requires placement of a bed rail to facilitate rolling, or requires setup of a l eg lifter or other assistive devices. Code 04, Supervision or touching assistance , if the helper provides verbal cues and/or touching/steadying and/or contact guard assistance as patient completes activity. Assistance may be provided throughout the activit y or intermittently. For example, the patient requires verbal cueing, coaxing, or general supervision for safety to complete the activity, or patient may require only incidental help such as contact guard or steadying assistance during the activity. Code 0 3, Partial/moderate assistance, if the helper does LESS THAN HALF the effort. Helper lifts, holds, or supports trunk or limbs, but provides less than half the effort. For example, the patient requires assistance such as partial weight -bearing assistance, b ut HELPER does LESS THAN HALF the effort. Code 02, Substantial/maximal assistance, if the helper does MORE THAN HALF the effort. Helper lifts or holds trunk or limbs and provides more than half the effort. Code 01, Dependent , if the helper does ALL of the effort. Patient does none of the effort to complete the activity, or the assistance of two or more helpers is required for the patient to complete the activity. Code 07, Patient refused , if the patient refused to complete the activity. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3 Section GG Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- D Guidance Manual Chapter 3: GG- 24 Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Code 09, Not applica ble, if the patient did not attempt to perform the activity and did not perform this activity prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury. Code 10, Not attempted due to environmental limitations , if the patient did not attempt this activity due t o environmental limitations. Examples include lack of equipment, weather constraints, etc. Code 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns , if the activity was not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns. A dash is a valid response for this item. CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Coding Tips and Examples General Coding Tips If a patient does not attempt the activity and a helper does not complete the activity, and the patient 's usual status cannot be determined based on patient or caregiver report, code the reason the activity was not attempted: Code 07 if the patient refused to attempt the activity Code 10 if the activity was not attempted due to environmental limitations Code 09 if the patient could not perform an activity at the time of assessment, and also could not perform the activity prior to the current illness, exacerbation or injury Code 88 i f the patient could not perform an activity at the time of the assessment, but could perform the activity prior to the current illness, exacerbation or injury If the only help a patient needs to complete an activity is for a helper to retrieve an assistive device or adaptive equipment, such as a cane for walking, or a tub bench for bathing then enter code 05, Setup or clean -up assistance. If two or more helpers are required to assist the patient to complete the activity, code as 01 Dependent. A dash ( -) indicates \" No information.\" Do not use a dash if the reason that the item was not assessed was because the patient refused (code 07), the item is not applicable (code 09), the activity was not attempted due to environmental limitations (code 10), or the activity was not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns (code 88). Coding Tips and Examples GG0170A , Roll Left and Right The activity includes the patient rolling to both the left and to the right while in a lying position , If at the time of the assessment the patient is unable to lie flat due to medical conditions or restrictions, but could perform this activity prior to the current illness, exacerbation or injury, code 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concern s. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3 Section GG Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- D Guidance Manual Chapter 3: GG- 25 Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services For example, if a clinician determines that a patient 's new medical need requires that the patient sit in an up right sitting position rather than a slightly elevated position, then code GG0170A, Roll left and right as 88, Not attempted due to medical or safety concerns . If at the time of the assessment the patient is unable to lie flat due to medical conditions or restrictions, and could not perform the activity prior to the current illness, exacerbation or injury, code 09, Not applicable. For GG0170A, Roll left and right, clinical judgment should be used to determine what is considered a \" lying \" position for the pa tient. For example, a clinician could determine that a patient 's preferred slightly elevated resting position is \" lying \" for that patient. 1. GG0170A, Roll Left and Right At SOC, t he physical therapist helps Mr. R turn onto his right side by instructing him to bend his left leg and roll to his right side. He then instructs him how to position his limbs to return to lying on his back and then to repeat a similar process for rolling onto his left side and then return to lying on his back. Mr. R completes the ac tivity without physical assistance from a helper. Mr. R was moving about in bed without difficulty prior to hospitalization. The therapist expects Mr. R will roll left and right by himself by discharge. Coding: GG0170A, Roll left and right, SOC Performance would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Discharge Goal would be coded 06, Independent. Rationale: At SOC, t he physical therapist provides verbal c ues (i.e., instructions) to Mr. R as he rolls from his back to his right side and returns to l ying on his back. The physical therapist does not provide any physical assistance. After assessment and considering his current condition, the therapist expects Mr. R will be independently rolling left and right at discharge. Coding Tips and Examples GG0170B, Sit to Lying The activity includes the ability to move from sitting on side of bed to lying flat on the bed. If at the time of the assessment the patient is unable to lie flat due to medical conditions or restrictions , but could perform this activ ity prior to the current illness, exacerbation or injury, code 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concern s. For example, i f a clinician determines that a new patient medical need requires that the patient sit in an upright sitting positio n rather than a slightly elevated position, then code GG0170B, Sit to lying as 88, Not attempted due to medical or safety concerns . OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3 Section GG Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- D Guidance Manual Chapter 3: GG- 26 Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services If at the time of the assessment the patient is unable to lie flat due to medical conditions or restrictions, and could not perform the activity prior to the current illness, exacerbation or injury, code 09, Not applicable. For GG0170B, Sit to lying, clinical judgment should be used to determine what is considered a \"lying \" position for the patient. For example, a clinician could determine that a patient 's preferred slightly elevated resting position is \" lying \" for that patient. 2. GG0170B, Sit to Lying Mr. A suffered multiple vertebral fractures due to a fall off a ladder. At SOC, h e requires assistance from a therapist to get from a sitting position to lying flat on the bed because of significant pain in his lower back. The therapist supports his trunk and lifts both legs to assist Mr. A from sitting at the side of the bed to lying flat on the bed. Mr. A assists himself a small amount by raising one leg onto the bed and then bending both knees while transitioning into a lying position. Coding: GG0170B , Sit to lying SOC Performance would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Rationale: The therapist provided more than half the effort for the patient to complete the activity of sit to lying. At SOC, Mrs. H requires assistance from two helpers to transfer from sitting at the edge of the bed to lying flat on the bed due to paralys is on her right side, obesity, and cognitive limitations. One of the helpers explains to Mrs. H each step of the sitting to lying activity. Mrs. H is then fully assisted to get from sitting to a lying position on the bed. Mrs. H makes no attempt to assist when asked to perform the incremental steps of the activity. Coding: GG0170B, Sit to lying, SOC Performance would be coded 01, Dependent. Rationale: The patient does none of the effort to complete the activity, and t he assistance of two helpers is needed to complete the activity of sit to lying. If two or more helpers are required to assist the patient to complete an activity, code as 01, Dependent. Coding Tips and Examples GG0170C, Lying to Sitting on Side of Bed The activity includes patient transitions from lying on his/her back to sitting on the side of the bed with feet flat on the floor and sitting upright on the bed without back support. If a patient 's feet do not reach the floor upon lying to sitting, the c linician will determine if a bed height adjustment (if applicable), or a foot stool is required to accommodate foot placement on the floor/footstool. Back support refers to an object or person providing support of the patient 's back. If at the time of the assessment the patient is unable to lie flat due to medical conditions or restrictions, but could perform this activity prior to the current illness, OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3 Section GG Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- D Guidance Manual Chapter 3: GG- 27 Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services exacerbation or injury, code 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concern s. If a clinician determines that a new patient medical need requires that the patient sit in an upright sitting position rather than a slightly elevated position, then code GG0170C, Lying to sitting on side of bed as 88, Not attempted due to medical or safet y concerns , If at the time of the assessment the patient is unable to lie flat due to medical conditions or restrictions, and could not perform the activity prior to the current illness, exacerbation or injury, code 09, Not applicable. For GG0170C, Lying t o sitting on side of bed, clinical judgment should be used to determine what is considered a \"lying \" position for the patient. For example, a clinician could determine that a patient' s preferred slightly elevated resting position is \"lying \" for that patien t. 3. GG0170C, Lying to Sitting on Side of Bed Ms. H is recovering from a spinal fusion. At SOC, she rolls to her right side and pushes herself up fro m the bed to get from a lying to a seated position. The therapist provides needed verbal cues to guide Ms. H as she safely uses her hands and arms to support her trunk and avoid twisting as she raises herself from the bed. Ms. H then safely maneuvers to the edge of the bed, finally lowering her feet to the floor to complete the activity without hands -on assistanc e. Coding: GG0170C, Lying to sitting on side of bed SOC Performance would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: The therapist provides verbal cues only as Ms. H safely moves from a lying to sitting position on the side of the bed with her feet on the floor. Coding Tips and Examples, GG0170 D, Sit to Stand The activity includes the patient coming to a stand ing position from sitting in a chair, wheelchair, or on the side of the bed. If the only help a patient needs to complete the sit to stand activity is for a helper to retrieve an assistive device or adaptive equipment, such as a walker or ankle foot orthosis , then enter code 05, Setup or clean- up assistance. 4. GG0170 D, Sit to Stand Mr. B is being admitted to home health for pressure ulcer care. He has complete tetraplegia from an injury one year ago and has been unable to bear weight in stand ing since the injury . At SOC, using a patient lift that does not require him to come to standing, he is transferred from his bed into a wheelchair with assistance. Coding: GG0170D , Sit to stand SOC Performance would be coded 09, Not applicable. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3 Section GG Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- D Guidance Manual Chapter 3: GG- 28 Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Rationale: The activity was not attempte d at admission and the patient did not perform this activity prior to the current illness, exacerbation or injury (the pressure ulcer) due to the diagnosis of complete tetraplegia. Coding Tips and Examples GG0170E, Chair/Bed -to-Chair Transfer The activity begins with the patient sitting (in a chair, wheelchair, or at the edge of the bed) and transferring to sitting in a chair, wheelchair, or at the edge of the bed. Sit to lying and lying to sitting are not assessed as part of GG0170E. If a mec hanical lift is used to assist in transferring a patient for a chair/bed -to-chair transfer and two helpers are needed to assist with a mech anical lift transfer, then code 01, Dependent, even if the patient assists with any part of the chair/bed- to-chair transfer. 5. GG0170 E, Chair/Bed -to-Chair Transfer Mr. L had a stroke and uses a wheelchair for mobility. When Mr. L gets out of bed at SOC , the therapist moves the wheelchair into the correct position and locks the brakes so that Mr. L can transfer into the wheelchair safely. Mr. L transfer s into the wheelchair by himself without the need for supervision or assistance during the transfer. The family reports that Mr. L does transfer safely without the need for supervision, once the wheelchair is placed and loc ked. The nurse does not expect Mr. L 's mobility status to change by discharge. Coding: GG0170E, Chair/bed- to-chair transfer, SOC Performance would be coded 05, Setup or clean -up assistance. Discharge Goal would be coded 05, Setup or clean up assistance. Rationale: A helper must provide setup assistance only. Once set up is provided, Mr. L transfers safely and does not need supervision or physical assistance during the transfer. The nurse expects Mr. L will continue to need wheelchair setup assistance for this transfer at discharge. Coding Tips and Examples GG0170F, Toilet Transfer The activity includes the patient getting on and off a toilet or commode. Use of assistive device(s) and adaptive equipment (for instance a grab bar or elevated toilet) required to complete the toilet transfer should not affect coding of the activity. If the only help a patient needs to complete the toilet transfer activity is for a helper to retrieve and place the toilet seat riser, and remove it aft er patient use, then enter code 05, Setup or clean- up assistance. Toileting hygiene and clothing management are not considered part of the toilet transferring activity . If the patient requires assistance from two or more helpers to get on and off the toilet or commode, then enter code 01, Dependent. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3 Section GG Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- D Guidance Manual Chapter 3: GG- 29 Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 6. GG0170 F, Toilet Transfer The assessing clinician notes that the home health aide visit note ( documented on the afternoon visit on the SOC date ) stated that the aide needed to steady Mrs. Z with a light contact when the patient lowers her underwear and then transfers onto the toilet. After voiding, Mrs. Z cleanses herself. She then stands up supporting her own weight as the aide steadies her . Mrs. Z pulls up her underwear as the aide steadies her to ensure Mrs. Z does not lose her balance. Coding: GG0170F, Toilet transfer, SOC Performance would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: The aide provides steadying assistance only as the patient transfers on and off the toilet. Assistance with managing clothing and cleansing is coded under item GG0130C, Toileting hygiene, and is not considered when rating the Toilet transfer item. At SOC, Mrs. S is on bedrest due to a new medical complication. She uses a bedpan for bladder and bowel management. The assessing clinician expects the patient will return to independent use of the bathroom toilet once the current condition resolves. Coding: GG0170F, Toilet transfer SOC Performance would be coded 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns. Discharge Goal would be coded 06 Independent. Rationale: At SOC, t he patient does not transfer onto or off a toilet due to being on bedrest because of a new medical condition , but was able to perform this activity prior to the current medical condition. It is expected t hat the patient will be independent in the activity at discharge. Coding Tips and Examples GG0170G, Car Transfer The activity includes transferring in and out of a car or van on the passenger side. Does not include opening or closing the car door, or fast ening seat belt. If the patient is not able to attempt car transfers (for example because no car is available, or there are weather or other environmental constraints ), and the patient 's usual status cannot be determined based on patient or caregiver report, enter code 10 Not attempted due to environmental limitations . If at the time of the assessment the patient is unable to attempt car transfers, and could not perform the car transfers prior to the current illness, exacerbation or injury, code 09, Not applicable. 7. GG0170 , Car Transfer Mrs. W uses a wheelchair and ambulates for only short distances. At SOC, Mrs. W requires the physical therapist to lift most of her weight to get from a seated position in the wheelchair to a standing position. The therapist provides trunk support when Mrs. W takes several steps during the transfer turn. Mrs. W lowers herself into the car seat with steadying assistance from the OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3 Section GG Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- D Guidance Manual Chapter 3: GG- 30 Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services therapist. Mrs. W moves her legs into the car as th e therapist lifts the weight of her legs from the ground. Coding: GG0170G, Car transfer SOC Performance would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Rationale: The therapist completed more than half the effort to transfer Mrs. W into the car by providing significant lifting assistance from the wheelchair , trunk support when taking steps toward the car seat , steadying when lowering into the car seat and lifting support when moving legs into the car . Mrs. W contributes less than half of the effort to complete the activity. The day after being admitted to home health, Mrs. N works with an occupational therapist on transfers in and out of the passenger side of a car. When reviewing the therapist 's evaluation, the assessing clinician reads that when performing car transfers, Mrs. N require d verbal reminders for safety and contact guarding assistance from the OT for guidance and direction. The therapist instruct ed the patient on strategic hand placement while Mrs. N transition ed to sitting into the car seat. Documentation showed that t he therapist opened and close d the car door. Coding: GG0170G, Car transfer SOC Performance would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: The therapist provides touching assistance only as the patient transfers in the passenger seat of the car. Assistance with opening and closing the car door is not included in the definition of this item and is not considered when coding this item. Coding Tips and Examples GG0170I, Walk 10 Feet Starting from standing, the activity includes walking at least 10 feet in a room, corridor, or similar space. Use of assistive device(s) and adaptive equipment (for instance a cane or leg brace) required to complete the walking activity should not affect coding of the act ivity. If the only help a patient needs to complete the walking activity is for a helper to retrieve and place the walker and/or put it away after patient use, then enter code 05, Setup or clean -up assistance. 8. GG0170 I, Walk 10 Feet Mr. L had bilateral amputations 3 years ago, and prior to this HH admission he used a wheelchair and did not walk. At SOC, Mr. L does not use prosthetic devices and only uses a wheelchair for mobility. Mr. L 's care plan includes assisting with fitting and use of bilateral lower extremity prostheses. The therapist 's care plan goal is for Mr. L to walk distances of 3 0 feet with supervision within his home and then discharge to outpatient therapy. Coding: GG0170I, Walk 10 feet, SOC Performance would be coded 09, Not applicable. Discharge Goal would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3 Section GG Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- D Guidance Manual Chapter 3: GG- 31 Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Rationale: When assessing the resident for GG0170I, Walk 10 feet, consider the patient 's status prior to the current illness, exacerbation or injury . Use code 09, Not applicable, because Mr. L could not perform the activity of walking at SOC, and did not perform the activity of walking prior to the current episode of care . The therapist expects Mr. L will be walking more than 10 feet with supervision by discharge. Codi ng Tips and Examples GG0170 J, Walk 50 Feet with Two Turns Starting from standing, the activity includes walking 50 feet and making two turns . The turns are 90 degree turns and may be in the same direction (two 90 degree turns to the right or two 90 degree turns to the left) or may be in different directions (one 90 degree turn to the right and one 90 degree turn to the left). The 90 degree turns should occur at the patient 's ability level (i.e., not jeopardizing patient safety), and can include the use of an assistive device (for example walker or crutches) without affecting coding of the activity. 9. GG0170 , Walk 50 Feet with Two Turns At SOC, Mr . B is recovering from a recent stroke and now has difficulty walking. Even with assistance, h e is able to walk only 30 feet. Mr. B 's care plan includes muscle strengthening and gait training. The therapist expects Mr. B will be able to walk 50 feet with two turns safely with the assistance of a caregiver for verbal cues and contact guard for steadying on the turns at discharge. Coding: GG0170J, Walk 50 feet with two turns, would be coded 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns . Discharg e Goal would be 04 Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: Mr. B is ambulatory but was not able to walk the entire distance because of his new medical condition (stroke) . Since the patient is unable to complete the activity at SOC, but was completing the activity prior to the recent stroke, Code 88 is appropriate. Although not able to complete the activity at SOC, the therapist anticipates Mr. B will be able to walk 50 feet with two turns safely with the assistance of a caregiver for verbal cues and contact guarding at discharge. Coding Tips and Examples GG0170K, Walk 150 Feet Starting from standing, the activity includes walking 150 feet in a corridor, or similar space. If the patient 's environment does not accommodate a walk of 150 feet without turns, but the patient demonstrates the ability to walk with or without assistance 150 feet with turns without jeopardizing the patient 's safety, code using the 6 -point scale. Use of assistive device(s) and adaptive equipment (for instance a rolling walke r or quad cane) required to complete the walking activity should not affect coding of the activity. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3 Section GG Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- D Guidance Manual Chapter 3: GG- 32 Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services If the only help a patient needs to complete the walking activity is for a helper to retrieve and place the assistive device and/or put it away after patien t use, then enter code 05, Setup or clean- up assistance. 10. GG0170K, Walk 150 Feet Mr. R has recent endurance limitations due to an exacerbation of heart failure and is only walking about 30 feet before he tires , loses strength and must sit and rest . He reports he was walking 150 feet or more with his cane prior to this exacerbation of his heart failure. Coding: GG0170K, Walk 150 feet would be coded 88, Activity not attempted due to medical or safety concerns. Rationale: The activity was not attempted due to Mr. R 's recent endurance limitations and current medical condition , but he was able to complete the activity prior to the recent exacerbation of his condition. Coding Tips and Examples GG0170L, Walking 10 Feet on Uneven Surfaces Once standing, the activity includes walking 10 feet on uneven or sloping surfaces (indoor or outdoor), such as turf or gravel. If the patient is not able to attempt walking on uneven surfaces (for example because no uneven surfaces are available, or there are weather or ot her environmental constraints limiting access), and the patient' s usual status for walking 10 feet on uneven surfaces cannot be determined based on patient or caregiver report, enter code 10 Not attempted due to environmental limitations. Use of assistive device(s) and adaptive equipment (for instance a rolling walker or quad cane) required to complete the walking activity should not affect coding of the activity. 11. GG0170 L, Walking 10 Feet on Uneven Surfaces Mrs. N has severe joint degenerative disease and i s recovering from sepsis. When walking on the uneven driveway was attempted yesterday when Mrs. N came home from the hospital, she reports that her neighbor had to hold her belt and help lift her a little during a few steps. The neighbor also provided help to advance the walker across the gravel driveway as the patient walked. Coding: GG0170L, Walking 10 feet on uneven surfaces would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. Rationale: Per patient report, Mrs. N requires help provide some weight -bearing support, and assist in advancing the walker as she walk ed 10 feet on uneven surfaces. The helper does less than half the effort for walking 10 feet on uneven surfaces . Coding Tips and Examples GG0170M, 1 Step (curb) The activity includes the patient going up and down a curb and/or one step. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3 Section GG Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- D Guidance Manual Chapter 3: GG- 33 Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Use of assistive device(s) and adaptive equipment (for instance a railing or cane) required to complete the activity should not affect coding of the activity. 12. GG0170 M, 1 Step (curb) Mrs. Z had a stroke and needs to learn how to step up and down one step to enter and exit her home. At SOC, t he physical therapist provides needed verbal cueing as Mrs. Z uses her quad cane to aid her balance in stepping up and back down one step. The ther apist does not provide any physical assistance. Coding: GG0170M, 1 step would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance . Rationale: The patient needs only verbal cueing to complete the activity of stepping up and down one step. Coding Tips and Examp les GG0170N, 4 Steps The activity includes the patient going up and down four steps with or without a rail. Use of assistive device(s) and adaptive equipment (for instance a railing or cane) required to complete the activity should not affect coding of the activity. If at the time of the assessment the patient is unable to complete the activity due to a physician prescribed restriction (for instance, no stair climbing for 2 weeks), but could perform this activity prior to the current illness, exacerbation or injury, code 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concern. 13. GG0170 N, 4 Steps At SOC, Mr. J has lower body weakness and the physical therapist provides light touching assist ance when he ascends 4 steps. While descending 4 steps, the physical therapist faces the patient and descends the stairs providing minimal trunk support , with one hand on the patient 's hip and the other holding the gait belt, as Mr. J holds the stair railing. Coding: GG0170N, 4 steps would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance . Rationale: The therapist provides touching assistance as Mr. J ascends 4 steps. The therapist provides minimal trunk support when he descends the 4 step s, providing less than half the effort to complete the activity . The patient requires partial/moderate assistance to up and down 4 steps. Coding Tips and Examples GG0170O, 12 Steps The activity includes the patient going up and down 12 steps with or without a rail. Use of assistive device(s) and adaptive equipment (for instance a railing or cane) required to complete the activity should not affect coding of the activity. If at the time of the assessment the patient is unable to complete the activity due to a physician prescribed restriction (for instance, no stair climbing for 2 weeks), but could perform this activity prior to the current illness, exacerbation or injury, code 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concern. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3 Section GG Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- D Guidance Manual Chapter 3: GG- 34 Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 14. GG0170 O, 12 St eps At SOC, Ms. Y is recovering from a stroke and has 12 stairs with a railing and she needs to use these stairs to enter and exit her home. The physical therapist uses a gait belt around her trunk and at times is required to support much of the patient 's weight as Ms. Y ascends and then descends 12 stairs. Coding: GG0170O, 12 steps would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance . Rationale: The therapist provides more than half the effort in providing the necessary support for Ms. Y as she ascends and descends 12 stairs by intermittently supporting much of her weight using a gait belt . Mrs. D is returning home after a hip replacement. She is restricted from stair climbing until she is seen for her follow -up MD appointment. Just prior to her surgery, she was able to climb her flight of 12 stairs with stand -by assist of her niece. Coding: GG0170O, 12 steps would be coded 88 - Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns . Rationale: At the SOC, the patient is unable to complete the activity of going up and down 12 steps due to a temporary physician- ordered activity restriction. Prior to the recent surgery, Mrs. D was able to complete that activity with assistance so code 88 is appropriate. Coding Tips and Examples GG0170P, Picking up Object The activity includes the patient bending/stooping from a standing position to pick up a small object, such a spoon, from the floor. Use of assistive device(s) and adaptive equipment (for instance a cane to support standing balance and a reacher to pick up t he object) required to complete the activity should not affect coding of the activity. If at the time of the assessment the patient is unable to complete the activity (for instance is unable to stand), and could not stand to perform this activity prior to the current illness, exacerbation or injury, code 09, Not applicable. 15. GG0170 P, Picking up Object Mr. P has a neurologic condition that has resulted in coordination and balance problems. At SOC, he reports he and his wife worked with the OT in the SNF on pi cking things off the floor. He demonstrates how he stoops to pick up a pencil from the floor as his wife provides the right amount of verbal cues for safety and stands by , ready to help in case he loses his balance . Coding: GG0170P, Picking up object would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: A caregiver is needed to provide verbal cues and stand -by assistance when Mr. P picks up an object due to his coordination issues. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3 Section GG Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- D Guidance Manual Chapter 3: GG- 35 Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Ms. C has recently undergone a hip replacement. At SOC, s he wal ks with a walker without assistance. When she drop s a hair brush from her walker basket , she ask s her daughter to locate her long- handled reacher and bring it to her . Using the reacher, Mrs. C is able to bend slightly, and safely pick up the hair brush with the reacher , without need of additional assistance or verbal cues. Coding: GG0170P, Picking up object would be coded 05, Set -up or clean -up assistance. Rationale: The daughter provides set -up assistance only by retrieving the reacher and then the patient is able use the device to pick up the hairbrush safely . Coding Tips and Examples GG0170Q, Does the Patient Use a Wheelchair/Scooter? The intent of the wheelchair mobility item is to assess the ability of patients who are learning how to self -mobilize using a wheelchair or patients who used a wheelchair prior to admission. Use clinical judgment to determine if the patient' s use of a wheelchair is for self - mobilization due to the patient 's medical condition or safety. If the patient is ambulatory and is not learning how to mobilize in a wheelchair, and only uses a wheelchair for transport within a larger living facility (assisted living facility or apartment complex) , or for community mobility outside the home (for instance to a physician appointment or to dialysis) , enter code 0 - No for GG0170Q Does the patient use a wheelchair/scooter, and skip all remaining wheelchair questions. Coding Tips and Examples GG0170R, Wheel 50 Feet with Two Turns , and GG0170RR, Indicate the Type of Wheelchair or Scooter Used Once seated in the wheelchair or scooter, the activit y includes wheeling at least 50 feet and making two turns. Indicate whether the w heelchair or scooter used is manual or motorized. The turns are 90 degree turns and may be in the same direction (two 90 degree turns to the right or two 90 degree turns to the left) or may be in different directions (one 90 degree turn to the right and one 90 degree turn to the left). The 90 degree turns should occur at the patient 's ability level (i.e., not jeopardizing patient safety). 16. GG0170R, Wheel 50 Feet with Two Turns , and GG0170RR, Indicate the Type of Wheelchair or Scooter Used At SOC, Mrs. M is unable to bear any weight on her right leg due to a recent fracture. The nurse observes as t he certified nursing assistant in the assisted living facility provides steadying assistance when transferring Mrs. M from the bed into her manual wheelch air. Once in her wheelchair, Mrs. M propels herself safely about 60 feet down the hall using her left leg and safely makes two turns without any necessary physical assistance or supervision. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3 Section GG Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- D Guidance Manual Chapter 3: GG- 36 Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Coding: GG0170R, Wheel 50 feet with two turns would be coded 06, Independent. Rationale: Mrs. M wheels herself more than 50 feet safely without need for supervision or physical assistance. Assistance provided with the transfer is not considered when scoring Wheel 50 feet with two turns. Score assistance with b ed to cha ir transfer in GG0170E. Indicate the type of wheelchair/scooter used: In the above example Mrs. M used a manual wheelchair. Coding: GG0170RR, Indicate the type of wheelchair/scooter used would be coded 1, Manual. Rationale: Mrs. M uses a manual wheelchair to self -mobilize. Once seated in the manual wheelchair, Ms. R wheels about 10 feet , including around one corner to the hallway. Due to shoulder pain, she asks her son to push the wheelchair the additional 40 feet around another corner and into her bathroo m. Coding: GG0170R, Wheel 50 feet with two turns would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Rationale: The helper provides more than half the effort to assist the patient to complete the activity. Indicate the type of wheelchair/scooter used: In the above example Ms. R used a manual wheelchair. Coding: GG0170RR, Indicate the type of wheelchair/scooter used would be coded 1, Manual. Rationale: Ms. R used a manual wheelchair. Coding Tips and Examples GG0170S, Wheel 150 Feet and GG0170SS , Indicate the Type of Wheelchair/Scooter Used Once seated in the wheelchair or scooter, the activity includes wheeling at least 150 feet in a corridor or similar space. Indicate whether the wheelchair or scooter used is manual or motorized. If the patient 's environment does not accommodat e wheelchair/scooter use of 150 feet without turns, but the patient demonstrates the ability to mobilize the wheelchair/scooter with or without assistance 150 feet with turns without jeopardizing the patient 's safety, code using the 6 -point scale. 17. GG0170S, Wheel 150 Feet and GG0170SS, Indicate the Type of Wheelchair/Scooter Used Mr. N uses a below -the-knee prosthetic limb. Mr. N has peripheral neuropathy and limited vision due to complications of diabetes. Via observation and patient report, the assessing clinician OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3 Section GG Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- D Guidance Manual Chapter 3: GG- 37 Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services determines that Mr. N 's usual performance is that a helper is needed to provide verbal cues for safety due to vision deficits , and the patient mobilizes his manual wheelchair a distance of 150 within his home. Coding: GG0170S, Wheel 150 feet would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: Mr. N requires the helper to provide verbal cues for his safety when using a wheelchair for 150 feet. Indicate the type of wheelchair/scooter used: In the ab ove example Mr. N used a manual wheelchair. Coding: GG0170SS, Indicate the type of wheelchair/scooter used would be coded 1, Manual.

Code 1, Yes, if the patient has fallen since the most recent SOC/ROC. A dash is a valid response for this item. CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. DEFINITION FALL Unintentional change in position coming to rest on the ground, floor, or onto the next lower surface (such as a bed or chair). The fall may be witnessed or unwitnessed, reported by the patient or an observer, or identified when a patient is found on the floor or ground. Falls are not a result of an overwhelming external force (such as, a person pushes a patient). An intercepted fall occurs when the patient would have fallen if he or she had not caught him/herself or had not been intercepted by another person\u2014this is still considered a fall. CMS understands that challenging a patient's balance and training him/her to recover from a loss of balance is an intentional therapeutic intervention and does not consider anticipated losses of balance that occur during supervised therapeutic interventions as intercepted falls. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3 Section J Health Conditions OASIS- D Guidance Manual Chapter 3: J-2 Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Examples 1. Unwitnessed Fall The discharging RN reviews the clinical record and interviews the patient and caregiver, Mrs. K and her daughter Susan, determining that a single fall occurred since the most recent SOC/ROC. The fall is documented on a clinical note from an RN home visit in which Susan reported her mother slipped from her wheelchair to the floor the previous day. Coding: J1800, Any Falls since SOC/ROC, would be coded 1, Yes. Rationale: This item addresses unwitnessed as well as witnessed falls. 2. Intercepted Fall An incident report describes an event in which Mr. S appeared to slip on a wet spot on the floor during a home health aide bath visit. He lost his balance and bumped into the wall, but was able to steady himself and remain standing. Coding: J1800, Any Falls since SOC/ROC, would be coded 1, Yes. Rationale: An intercepted fall is considered a fall. 3. Balance Training - Challenge Balance A patient is participating in balance retraining activities during a therapy visit. The therapist is intentionally challenging patient 's balance, anticipating a loss of balance. The patient has a loss of balance to the left due to hemiplegia and the physical therapist provides minimal assistance to allow the patient to maintain standing. Coding: J1800, Any Falls since SOC/ROC, would be coded 0, No. Rationale: The patient 's balance was intentionally being challenged by the physical therapist, so a loss of balance is anticipated. When assistance is provided to a patient to allow him/her to maintain standing during an anticipated loss of balance during a supervised therapeutic intervention, this is not considered a fall or intercepted fall. 4. Unanticipated Fall During Therapy A patient is ambulating with a walker with the help of the physical therapist. The patient stumbles and the therapist has to bear some of the patient 's weight in order to prevent a fall. Coding: J1800, Any Falls since SOC/ROC would be coded 1, Yes. Rationale: The patient 's stumble was not anticipated by the therapist. The therapist intervened to prevent a fall . An intercepted fall is considered a fall.

One Fall Since Most Recent SOC/ROC, with No Injury The discharging RN reviews the clinical record and interviews Mrs. K and her daughter Susan, the patient and careg iver, determining that a single fall occurred since the most recent SOC/ROC. The fall is documented on a clinical note from an RN home visit in which Susan reported that her mother slipped from her wheelchair to the floor the previous day. Susan contacted the EMTs for help returning Mrs. K to her wheelchair; the EMT assessment at that time identified no injury. Documentation of the RN assessment during the home visit details no injury identified related to the fall. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3 Section J Health Conditions OASIS- D Guidance Manual Chapter 3: J-6 Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Coding: J1900A, No injury would be coded 1, one non- injurious fall since the most recent SOC/ROC .

J1900C, Major injury would be coded 0, no falls with major injur y since the most recent SOC/ROC. Rationale: Only one fall is identified since the most recent SOC/ROC, and the patient sustained no injury in the fall. 2. One Fall Since Most Recent SOC/ROC with Injury (not major) Review of the clinical record and incident reports, and, patient and caregiver report, identify that a single fall occurred since the most recent SOC/ROC. The fall is documented on a clinical note from an RN home visit that describes the patient Mr. R's report of a fall that occurred between visits, in which he tripped on the dog, fell against the wall and banged his elbow, sustaining a skin tear that he treated himself. Documentation of the RN assessment during the home visit details the healing skin tear, and no other injury or symptom identified related to the fall. Coding: J1900A. No injury, would be coded 0, no non-injurious fall s since the most recent SOC/ROC. J1900B. Injury (except major), would be coded 1, one injurious (except major) fall since the most recent SOC/ROC. J1900C. Major injury, would be coded 0, no falls with major injury since the most recent SOC/ROC. Rationale: Documentation of only one fall since the most recent SOC/ROC is identified. A laceration is considered an injury (except major). 3. One Fall Since the Most Recent SOC/ROC, with Major Injury Review of the patient record and incident reports, and, patient and caregiver report identify that a single fall occurred since the most recent SOC/ROC. The fall is documented on an incident report that describes a telephone call received from the patient, Mrs. B's, daughter Mary, in which Mary reported Mrs. B fell at home and hit her head, and was transported via ambulance to the emergency room. Examination and testing revealed a subdural hematoma. Mrs. B was held in observation stay and received treatment, returning home in stable condition after 48 hours. Coding: J1900A, No injury, would be coded 0, no non- injurious falls since the most recent SOC/ROC. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3 Section J Health Conditions OASIS- D Guidance Manual Chapter 3: J-7 Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services J1900B, Injury (except major), would be coded 0, no falls with injury (except major) since the most recent SOC/ROC. J1900C, Major injury, would be coded 1, one fall with major injury since the most recent SOC/ROC . Rationale: Documentation of only one fall since the most recent SOC/ROC is identified. Subdural hematoma is considered a major injury. 4. Two Falls Since the Most Recent SOC/ROC, One with Injury (except major), One with No Injury Review of the patient record, incident reports and patient and caregiver report identify that two falls occurred since the most recent SOC/ROC. The falls are documented on clinical notes. The first describes an event during which Mr. G tripped on the bathroom rug and almost fell, but caught himself against the sink. The RN assessment identified no injury. The second describes an event during which Mr. G, while coming up the basement stairs with the laundry, fell against the stair and sustained a bruise and laceration on his left knee. Coding: J1900A, No injury, would be coded 1, one non- injurious fall since the most recent SOC/ROC. J1900B, Injury (except major), would be coded 1, one injurious (except major) fall since the most recent SOC/ROC . J1900C, Maj or injury, would be coded 0, no falls with major injury since the most recent SOC/ROC . Rationale: The first fall is an intercepted fall, which is considered a fall. The patient sustained no injury as a result of this fall. The second fall resulted in a laceration and bruising, considered injury, but not major injury. 5. One Fall Since the Most Recent SOC/ROC, with Multiple Injuries Review of the patient record, incident reports and patient and caregiver report identify that a single fall occurred since the m ost recent SOC/ROC. The fall is documented on an incident report, which describes an event during which Mrs. J fell while walking from her bedroom to the bathroom and was transported to the emergency room via ambulance. Examination and testing revealed a s kin tear on Mrs. J's left hand, bruising on both knees, and a fractured left hip. Coding: J1900A, No injury, would be coded 0, no non- injurious falls since the most recent SOC/ROC. J1900B, Injury (except major), would be coded 0, no injurious (except maj or) falls since the most recent SOC/ROC. OASIS Guidance Manual Chapter 3 Section J Health Conditions OASIS- D Guidance Manual Chapter 3: J -8 Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services J1900C, Major injury, would be coded 1, one fall with major injury since the most recent SOC/ROC. Rationale: Documentation of only one fall since the most recent SOC/ROC was identified. The patient sustained multiple injuries in the fall. When multiple injuries are sustained in a single fall, code the injury of highest severity.

What is the association between the Comprehensive Assessment and the OASIS data sets? Since 1999, the Home Health Agency (HHA) Conditions of Participation ( CoPs ) have required that each patient receive a patient -specific comprehensive assessment. A revised CoP for comprehensive assessment went into effect January 13, 2018. The majority of requirements were retained. A new standard \"Content of the comprehensive assessment \" was established, incorporating much of the previous standard and adding new requirements. Users are encouraged to refer directly to the HHA C oPs for complete, current information: The Medicare & Medicaid Program Conditions of Participation for Home Health Agencies Rule published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in the Federal Register on 1/13/17. must incorporate the current version of the OASIS items into the comprehensive assessment for adult, non-maternity patients. The HHAs are free to rearrange OASIS item sequence in a way that permits logical ordering within their own forms as long as the actual item content, skip patterns, and OASIS number remain the same. OASIS data elements form a substantial portion of the comprehensive assessment. However, t he data items in OASIS alone do not constitute a thorough comprehensive assessment. For example, the OASIS items do not include vital signs, assessment of breath sounds, or collection of data on fluid intake, which are part of a more complete patient assessment. OASIS data collection and reporting is not required for non-Medicare or Medicaid payers, however, all home health patients who receive skilled care are required to have a comprehensive assessment regardless of payer source per the requirements. Patients who receive non-skilled home health services such as homemaker, chore, or companion services are not required by the CoPs to have a comprehensive assessment. OASIS Guidance Manual Appendix B OASIS- D Gu idance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Appendix B -1 APPENDIX B: OASIS DATA ACCURACY 1. DATA ACCURACY Medicare Home Health Care Conditions of Participation Standard: Accuracy of Encoded OASIS Data (See the link for Home Health CoP at the CMS.gov Home Health Agency Center https://www.cms.gov/center/provider -Type/home- Health -Agenc y-HHA -Center.html ) stipulates that the encoded OASIS data must accurately reflect the patient 's status at the time the information is collected. Before transmission, the HHA must ensure that data items on its own clinical record match the encoded data that are sent to CMS. Once the qualified skilled professional (specifically, RN, PT, SLP/ST, or OT) completes the assessment, the HHA should develop means to ensure that the OASIS data input into the computer and transmitted to the CMS exactly reflect the data collected by the skilled professional. In addition, the State survey process for HHAs may include review of OASIS data collected versus data encoded and transmitted to the CMS. 2. DATA QUALITY AUDITS Data-driven systems, such as OASIS data collection and outcome measurement, depend on the accuracy of source data describing patient health status. It follows that minimizing data errors that could affect accuracy of clinical data or outcome analyses is a necessary condition. This function is the responsibility of the agency since, ultimately, agency - level outcome reports reflect the data agencies input into the system. Internal staff development and training must focus on data accuracy not only at the start -up of OASIS data collection, but on a continuing basis . We recommend that data quality audits be conducted in agencies on a routine basis. Some data audit activities should be conducted monthly, while others can be conducted at less frequent intervals, such as quarterly. The following guidelines provide a method for monitoring the quality of data in an agency. Types of audits, their recommended frequency, and categories of staff members (to conduct data audit activities and summarize findings) are suggested. If problems are identified, it is also recommended that the agency develop and implement a plan to correct data quality problems. Table B.1 displays the data quality audit approaches discussed and summarizes the purpose, frequency, and procedures for each. Table B.1: Data Quality Audits Audit Type Purpose Frequency Overview of Procedure Performed By Clinical Record Audit To verify accuracy of OASIS patient status items compared to other related patient documentation Monthly Review at least five SOC records and five discharge records. Compare OASIS items to other documentation from the SOC or discharge visits and from other visits surrounding SOC or discharge. QI coordinator or clerical staff Data Entry Audit To verify accuracy of OASIS data entry and the data in the clinical record (or using double data entry) Monthly Either: Obtain a hardcopy of OASIS data that were entered for five patients. Compare to OASIS items in clinical record; or Data enter OASIS information for five patients twice. Compare data entered the first time to data entered the second time for each patient. QI coordinator, IS/IT coordinator, or data entry staff Clinical Audit Visits To verify accuracy of OASIS assessment data (that is, evaluate assessment methodology and assessment skills of clinical staff) Quarterly For at least three or four patients, a supervisor or peer auditor attends the SOC visit. The auditor completes OASIS items while the care provider conducts the assessment and completes SOC paperwork. OASIS items are compared for consistency between auditor and care pr ovider. QI coordinator, clinical supervisor, or clinical staff OASIS Guidance Manual Appendix B OASIS- D Gu idance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Appendix B -2 a. Monthly Audit Activities Clinical Record Audits: Clinical record audits allow an agency to monitor the validity of OASIS data. The quality check assesses the congruence of OASIS data with other patient status information found in the clinical record. This audit allows an agency to check for systematic bias in describing patient status. Most often, this will take the form of exaggerating illness or disability at start of care to enhance the justification for providing services and, under prospective payment, to maximize payment. There may also be a concomitant bias in the opposite direction for a discharge assessment, driven by a desire to make patient outcomes appear in a more favorable light or simply as a justification for discharge (for example, the goal of reaching a certain level of functioning has been met). To conduct a clinical record audit, an abbreviated record review can be conducted for at least five new admissions and five patien ts discharged from the agency (but not due to an inpatient facility admission). Records should be randomly selected, in order to evaluate data quality for a cross -section of patients and care providers. The selection process might be as follows: 1. Choose a standing date for record selection (for example, the first Tuesday of every month). On that day each month, alphabetically compile a list of all skilled care patients admitted to the agency for the previous month. For example, if the record selection date for February falls on February 3rd, compile a list of all patients admitted to the agency from January 3rd to February 2nd. 2. Count the number of patients on the list. Divide that number by five, rounding down to the nearest whole number. For example, if there are 42 patients on the list, 42 \u00f7 5 = 8.4, which would be rounded to 8. This number, n, will be used to select records. Divide this number by 2 to obtain the starting point, m, for selecting records. 3. Count from the first patient alphabetically, select the mth patient, and select every nth patient after that. Using the above example, you would select the 4th person and then every 8th person on the list for record review. 4. The same procedure should be used to select records for discharged patients. Compile a list of patients discharged from the agency within the previous month. Divide the number of patients by five, and use that number (n) to select patients for record review. 5. In the event that you have fewer than five patients admitted to or discharged from your agency, review all records. It should be noted that many agencies choose to audit a larger sample and some audit 100% of records. Procedure for Clinical Record Audits : For new admissions, review the start of care (SOC) OASIS items and compare to other admission documentation and two or three subsequent visit notes, if they occur within the first week after SOC. In addition, if care providers from two disciplines perform assessments on the patient within one week of SOC (for example, registered nurse conducts comprehensive assessment visit and completes OASIS items; the physical therapist visits two days later and evaluates the patient), the documentation should be compared. Reviewers should evaluate whether any discrepancies between the SOC OASIS assessment and the other documentation are sufficiently significant to indicate a data quality problem. For example, if the SOC OASIS items indicate that the patient is fully independent in ambulation, but other documentation indicates that the patient needs assistance when walking, a data quality problem may exist. Assess for any discrepancies between sociodemographic items (for example, patient ID number or age) in addition to discrepancies in clinical assessments (ICD -10-CM codes, all clinical assessment OASIS items). The records for discharged patients should be reviewed in the same manner. All discharge OASIS patient status items should be compared to other discharge information as well as to the previous two or three visit notes (if those visits occur w ithin the same week of discharge). If there are large differences in descriptions of the patient, a potential data quality problem exists. If differences are found that cannot be explained by other documentation in the clinical record, the care provider wh o completed the OASIS should be contacted to determine if the discrepancies were real (for example, the patient did change significantly between the SOC visit and a visit the next day) or if an error was made when recording OASIS data. If data quality problems exist, the problems can be corrected. If clinical documentation must be amended, this should be done according to agency policy. Any corrections to OASIS data in the clinical record must also be reflected in the OASIS database maintained by the agency, and if data submission has already occurred, a correction must be transmitted to CMS. Data Entry Audits: Data entry audits allow agencies to monitor the accuracy of data entry. Data entry errors in fields such as birth date or health insurance number are often detected through other agency proc edures (for example, billing - if the data entry software communicates with other agency systems), while patient status data are not typically subjected to such verification. Such errors, however, can affect outcome analyses and should be monitored. This type OASIS Guidance Manual Appendix B OASIS- D Gu idance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Appendix B -3 of audit may not be relevant for agencies using electronic health records, as data entry occurs concurrently with the clinical assessment. To conduct a data entry audit, a small sample of Medicare and/or Medicaid (skilled care) patient records should be checked at monthly intervals. In this evaluation, the clinical documentation is compared to the OASIS data that was entered to assess for data entry errors. This can be done by visual inspection or by double data entry, where the same record is data entered twice. Procedure for Data Entry Audits: From the monthly list of Medicare and Medicaid patients admitted to the agency, select at least five records. The sample records need not be randomly selected, but if more than one person is responsible for data entry, some records entered by each staff member should be assessed. These may be the same records you use for the clinical audit. Obtain a printout of the information that was data entered or view the data online (the procedure for doing this will vary, depending upon the software you choose). Compare the response to each OASIS item in the clinical documentation with the computer printout or screen display of entered data. An alternative method is to have two staff conduct data entry of the same records independently and to compare the data records item by item . 1 I f discrepancies exist between the data that were entered and the OASIS items in the clinical record or between the OASIS items that were data entered twice , it is important to follow up with appropriate personnel. The agency database should be corrected and if necessary a correction should be transmitted to CMS. If data entry errors appear to be pervasive, a plan of action to remedy the problems should be developed and implemented. b . Quarterly Audit Activities Clinical Audit Visits: Clinical audit visits provide an opportunity to verify the quality of patient status data collected by clinicians. It is recommended that each quarter agencies conduct supervisory (or peer) audit visits to at least three to four patients. These audit visits should occur at the admission comprehensive assessment visit. Within a one-year period, each clinical staff member of an average-sized agency thus can receive an audit visit. T he supervisor or peer auditor should complete the SOC OASIS items while observing the care provider conducting the SOC visit. The care provider and auditor should not discuss OASIS items between themselves during the visit. The QI coordinator (or designated person) then compares each item on the SOC OASIS items completed by the care provider to the OASIS items completed by the auditor. Discrepancies should be noted. Any differences between OASIS items should be discussed jointly by the care provider and aud itor to determine the reasons for the differences and to ensure that care providers fully understand the OASIS items. It is not necessary to select a random sample of patients for the audit visits, but the QI coordinator or QI team should ensure that a variety of patients and care providers are represented. 3. SUMMARIZING AUDIT ACTIVITIES a. Documentation Age ncies should summarize findings from all audit activities as they are completed. Because these audit activities will be an ongoing quality monitoring activity, it may be helpful to include summaries of findings in quarterly QI reports. If data quality problems are identified from the audit activities, investigations should be conducted into the cause(s) of the problems, and action plans developed and implemented to resolve the problems. Approaches to assure that accurate patient -level data are utilized to describe patient status and to compute outcome measures increase the likelihood that agency -level outcome reports accurately describe the effectiveness of patient care. b. Making Corrections to OASIS Data For information about making corrections to OASIS data, refer to Survey and Certification Memo #15-18-HHA, Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) transition to the Automated Submission and Processing System (ASAP) and OASIS Correction policy. A copy of this memo is located on CMS.gov under Provider Enrollment and Certification/Quality Safety & Oversight - General Information/Policy & Memos to States and Regions. For additional details , please reference the OASIS Submission User 's Guide and Training site (QTSO site). 1 The exact mechanism for accomplishing double data entry will depend on the data entry software your agency uses. For example, jHAVEN does not directly support double data entry. However, a separate installation of jHAVEN could be used for the second data entry. The assessments could then be exported from their respective jHAVEN installations, and the exported data could be compared for consistency.

To fulfill this mandate, CMS implemented a regulation requiring electronic r eporting of OASIS data for Medicare and Medicaid patients to a centralized data submission system maintained by CMS as a Condition of Participation for HHAs. This rule provides guidelines for HHAs for the electronic transmission of the OASIS data as well as responsibilities of the provider in collecting and transmitting this information to CMS. Rules concerning the privacy of patient identifiable information generated by the OASIS were also set forth. CONDITION OF PARTICIPATION: REPORTING OASIS INFORMATION Encoding OASIS Data Once the comprehensive assessment has been completed and OASIS data collected, HHAs not already utilizing electronic capture of their OASIS data would enter the OASIS information into the computer system, referred to as \"encoding. \" All the time points of the OASIS assessments have a uniform time frame of thirty days from the date the assessment is completed (M0090 - Date Assessment Completed) for encoding and submitting the data. Once the OASIS data are encoded (in software available fro m CMS, or other software that conforms to the CMS standard data submission specifications), the agency will review each assessment and edit it for transmission to a centralized data submission system. During this preparation period, the HHA must run a soft ware application that subjects each patient data set to the CMS edit specifications and makes it transmission-ready. The agency must correct any information that does not pass the CMS -specified edits (e.g., data is missing, incorrect, or inconsistent). If errors are identified or suspected, staff entering data or preparing for submission may need to contact the qualified clinician who was responsible for completing the comprehensive assessment document, allowing necessary corrections to be made per agency policy. Delaying data entry or submission may impact the assessing clinician' s recall, and the resulting data accuracy. HHAs have flexibility in the method used to encode their data. Data can be encoded directly by the skilled professional who conducts the assessment into a laptop, hand -held, or tablet computer, by a clerical staff member from a hard copy of the completed assessment, or by a data entry operator or service with whom the HHA may contract to enter the data. Any of these are acceptable methods of meeting the regulatory reporting requirements for OASIS. However, the HHA is ultimately responsible for meeting the reporting requirements as well as maintaining patient confidentiality. Once the OASIS data are encoded, HHAs use their software to review and edit the data prior to data submission. When editing the data prior to transmission, it is important to remember that the edits include an electronic safety net to preclude the transmission of erroneous or inconsistent information and enforce the required formatting for the data set items. When transmitted, the patient assessment data are stabilized at the time point of the assessment, preventing the override of current assessment information with future or past information. Accuracy of Encoded OASIS Da ta The encoded OASIS data must accurately reflect the patient's status at the time of assessment. Before transmission, the HHA must ensure that data items on its own clinical record match the encoded data that are sent to the centralized data submission system. We expect that once the qualified skilled professional (specifically, RN, PT, SLP/ST, or OT) completes the assessment, the HHA will develop a means to ensure that the OASIS data input into the computer and transmitted to a centralized data submission system exactly reflect the data collected by the skilled professional. Appendix B contains recommendations for conducting data quality audits on a routine basis. In addition, the State survey process for HHAs may include review of OASIS data collected ver sus data encoded and transmitted. Transmission of OASIS Data CMS requires that the HHA electronically transmit the accurate, completed, and encoded OASIS data to a centralized data submission system within 30 days of the completion of the assessment (M0090 Date Assessment Completed). As long as the submission time frame is met, HHAs are free to develop schedules for transmitting the data that best suit their needs. Data must be transmitted in a format that meets the requirements specified in the data format standard (i.e., conforming to the CMS standard electronic record layouts, edit specifications, and data dictionary). HHAs that are required to submit OASIS data must do so using a secure connection to a network maintained by CMS or its contractor. OASIS Guidance Manual Appendix E OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Appendix E-2 Final Validation Report Once transmitted, the data submission is validated and feedback is provided to the HHA via the OASIS Final Validation Report or OASIS Submitter Final Validation Report as to whether the submission file(s) has been accepted or rejected and whether each submitted record meets the data format and edit requirements. An entire submission or individual records may be rejected for a variety of reasons. The HHA must make corrections and resubmit the data for any assessments that are rejected. If an assessment record causes non-fatal warning messages to be generated, the HHA may elect to submit a corrected assessment record but is not required to do so. HHAs must use a CMS -assigned branch identification number (where applicable) to identify branch- specific assessment information in a uniform fashion nationwide. This procedure finalized a process that began in January 2004, uniquely identifying every branch of every HHA certified to participate in the Medicare home health program. The system links the parent to the branch HHA and gives CMS the capability of monitoring the quality of care delivered by agencies down to the HHA branch level. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services For Medicare fee -for-service patients, the transmitted OASIS data also are utilized for billing. The HHA can submit a Request for Anticipated Payment (RAP) to their Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) when all of the four following conditions are met: After the OASIS assessment is complete, locked or export ready, or there is an agency -wide internal policy for establishing that the OASIS data is finalized for transmission to the centralized data submission system, A physician 's verbal orders for home care have been received and documented, A plan of care has been establis hed and sent to the physician, and The first service visit under that plan has been delivered. A n episode will be opened on Common Working File (CWF) with the receipt and processing of the RAP. RAPs, or in special cases claims, must be submitted for initia l HH PPS episodes, subsequent HH PPS episodes, or in transfer situations to start a new HH PPS episode when another episode is already open at a different agency. HHAs should submit the RAP as soon as possible after care begins to assure they are established as the primary HHA for the beneficiary. Data Format To meet the data format requirements, HHAs may use software developed by CMS (the most recent version of which is jHAVEN) or other vendor 's software that conforms to CMS standardized electronic record formats, edit specifications, and data dictionaries. The CMS software can be used for several purposes. HHAs can use CMS software to encode OASIS data, maintain agency and patient -specific OASIS information, and create export files to submit OASIS data. Th e CMS software provides comprehensive on- line help to users in encoding, editing, and transmitting these data sets. The CMS software can also be used as a core program by HHAs and software vendors for developing their own software that supports OASIS reporting requirements, while also supporting or developing programs that meet other agency needs. Additionally, CMS maintains a toll-free help line to support this software product. For questions, please call the help desk at 800-339-9313 or you can email ques tions to \"help@QTSO.com .\" The CMS software alerts the individual who is encoding the data to use the correct screens for the specific type of assessment record required. HHAs using paper copies of assessment instruments must differentiate among the various subsets of OASIS data set, i.e., specialized forms for particular assessment time points. HHAs are cautioned that the CMS software provides only the minimum requirements to encode data, apply mandatory edits, and pr epare data files for transmission. CMS will support these functions and applications. However, CMS does not intend to provide any other applications related to care planning, financial information, durable medical equipment, medications, personnel, or claims submission. Software developers are encouraged to use the CMS software to meet minimum requirements until they can ensure that their own software will accommodate CMS specifications and other applications useful for HHAs. If the HHA uses software other than software developed by CMS, it must conform to CMS standardized electronic data submission specifications. The current OASIS Data Set and Manuals can be found on the Home Health Quality Reporting Requirements page, at download the required OASIS data set documents by clicking on \"OASIS User Manuals, \" and then go to Downloads for the OASIS Guidance Manual. In Chapter 2 of the Guidance Manual, there is one document that OASIS Guidance Manual Appendix E OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Appendix E-3 includes all items in the data set, and additional documents for each data collection time point: start of care; resumption of care following an inpatient facility stay; follow -up; discharge (not to an inpatient facility); transfer to inpatient facility (with or without agency discharge); and death at home. In addition, CMS provides OASIS data entry and data management software. The software can be downloaded at no charge to HHAs and used to encode OASIS data and create data files ready for submission to CMS. Data subm ission specifications, data dictionaries, the HHA data submission manual, contact information for each state' s OASIS Automation Coordinator, and a link to the QIES Technical Support Office (QTSO) for OASIS Questions and Answers are located at https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality -Initiatives -Patient -Assessment -Instruments/OASIS/index.html . Other educational materials for HHAs will be posted on the website. The site is intended to provide direct access for HHAs, State agencies, CMS contractors, software vendors, professional organizations, and consumers. Vendors and agencies are encouraged to regularly review the website for information r elated to the computerization of OASIS and other CMS -related home health issues. CMS will continue to promote processes for ensuring accuracy in the software. Condition of Participation: Release of Patient Identifiable OASIS Information The HHA or an agent acting on behalf of the HHA must ensure that all protected health (patient- identifiable) information in the clinical record, including OASIS data, remains confidential and is not released to the public. The data must be secured and controlled, whether in hard copy or in electronic format. In addition to the provisions of this Condition of Participation, all HHAs must adhere to the provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) to ensure patient confidentiality and the security of patient information. (Further information on these requirements is provided on -line at https://www.cms.gov/Regulations -and-Guidance/Adminis trative - Simplification/HIPAA -ACA/ .) CMS specifies that the HHA who chooses to secure the services of an agent to complete the OASIS regulatory reporting requirements must secure a written contract between the HHA and the agent to not use or disclose the information. The agent may only release data to the extent the HHA itself is permitted to do so. It is believed that this CoP will act as a safeguard against the unauthorized use of a patient 's clinical record information, regardless of the form or storage method. State Agency Responsibilities for OASIS Collection Under section 1891(b) of the Social Security Act, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services must assure that processes are in place to protect the health and safety of individuals under the care of an HHA and to promote the effective and efficient use of public monies. Section 1864 of the Act authorizes the use of State health agencies to determine a provider 's compliance with the CoPs. State responsibilities in ensuring compliance with the CoPs are set forth at Part 488, Survey, Certification, and Enforcement Procedures. The State Agency must ensure that access to data is restricted (except for the transmission of data and reports to CMS) to the State Agency component that conduct s surveys for purposes related to this function, and to other entities if authorized by CMS. The State Agency must ensure that patient identifiable OASIS data are released only to the extent permitted under the Privacy Act of 1974 and the Administrative Simplification provision of the HIPAA Act of 1996. The System of Records supports the HHA/OASIS database. The State Agency provides technical support for HHAs. The State Agency or other entity designated by CMS must instruct each HHA on the administration of and integration of the OASIS data set into the facility 's own record keeping system; instruct each HHA on the use of software to encode and transmit OASIS data to the centralized data submission system; monitor each HHA 's ability to transmit OASIS data; and provide ongoing technical assistance and general support to HHAs in implementing the OASIS reporting requirements specified in the Conditions of Participation for HHAs. Privacy Act System of Records Notice The Privacy Act of 1974, requires records described in the System of Records Notices (SORNs) to be published in the Federal Register and posted to the internet . 1 Each SORN describes legal authority for data collection and maintenance and describes the types of information in the records .2 In the g roup of Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) SORNs, there is a specific SORN for HHA OASIS.

In the Social Security Act, Prospective Payment for Home Health Services, Section 1895 1895(B)(3) (ii) (V) specifies the manner in which CMS determines whether an HHA is in compliance .5 HHAs are required to submit OASIS assessments and Home Health Care Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Survey (HH CAHPS) data to meet the quality reporting requirements of section 1895(b)(3)(B)(v) of the Deficit Reduction Act.

Its initial purpose was to provide a standardized home health item set and standardized quality measures for use in quality improvement activities within individual home health agencies. The uses for OASIS data quickly expanded beyond quality measurement to also include determining reimbursement under Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS). The uses for OASIS data have continued to evolve over the years with significant quality and payment implications tied to OASIS data. The current uses for OASIS-based measures include: 1) Home Health Agency Medicare- certification surveys, 2) the measures on the consumer -focused Home Health Compare website, 3) the measures used in the Home Health Quality of Patient Care Star Ratings, 4) the measures used in the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Home Health Value- Based Purchasing (HHVBP) Model, and 5) the Quality Assessment Only (QAO) Metric used in home health pay -for- reporting (P4R). The OASIS instru ment is also expected to play a pivotal role in post -acute care quality improvement as advances are made related to the mandates of the Improving Medicare Post -Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 ( IMPACT Act ). HISTORY OF OASIS AND OUTCOME -BASED QUALITY IMPROVEMENT (OBQI) In the early 2000s, CMS developed and began to promote a quality improvement process that used OASIS -based measures as the foundation for home health quality improvement activities. This process was known as Home Health Outcome-Based Quality Improvement, or OBQI. CMS, through their contracts with state Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs), provided training to home health agencies nationally on OBQI. Agency training and use of OBQI to improve quality was a preparatory step for the upcoming home health public reporting of quality measures. In 2002, CMS announced plans for public reporting of home health quality measures. In the fall of 2003, CMS launched the Home Health Co mpare website (www.Medicare.gov) . This initiative encouraged consumers to use publicly available home health quality measures when selecting a home health agency. The launch of Home Health Compare was also a catalyst for agency quality -improvement activities as well as the marketing and promotion of quality of care by individual agencies. The OASIS -based measures created the foundation for these early activities and advances in home health quality improvement. UNDERSTANDING QUALIT Y & QUALITY IMPROVEM ENT What is quality? The term \"quality \" in healthcare may have many different meanings. However, standard definitions are required to be able to measure quality and to then improve quality. The OASIS -based quality measures provide the home health industry with a framework for defining quality in terms of what matters to a patient and their caregivers. The home health quality measures have included many measures of activities of daily living (ADLs), patient status, and home health agency care processes. These include the measures of \"Improvement in Ambulation-Locomotion\" \"Stabil ization in Grooming, \" \"Improvement in Pain Interfering with Activity, \" etc. These measures are important to patients as they symbolized quality of life and independence in a home setting. They are also important measures to home health clinicians as clinicians could implement best practice interventions to assist patients to improve or to stabilize in the measures that were most meaningful to the individual patients. The definition of quality for home health also includes measures of agency best practices that are expected to impact quality of care such \"Drug Regimen Review Conducted with Follow -Up for Identified Issues .\" On an agency -wide scale, agencies can then measure their overall progress in each quality measure to determine if they are improving in the measure, worsening in the measure, or remaining unchanged. Through t he Certification and Survey Provider Enhanced Report (CASPER) system, agencies can compare, or benchmark, their current performance on the individual quality measures to their prior performance for each individual measure and can also compare their perform ance to a national reference rate. A subset of all quality measures is available to the public on Home Health Compare. OASIS Guidance Manual Appendix F OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Appendix F-2 OUTCOME AND PROCESS MEASURES The initial OASIS -based quality measures were risk adjusted outcome measures. Shortly after the 2010 implem entation of OASIS -C, agencies were introduced to the first standardized process measures which were derived from OASIS data. OUTCOME MEASURES An outcome is a health status change that occurs over time, where the change is intrinsic to the patient. Outcome of care measures are one tool for examining changes in patient status that may be impacted by home health care services. Thus, a change in the patient 's environment, such as the provision of a walker or handrails in the patient 's residence, is not considered an outcome according to this definition\u2014 such changes are services or processes of care. Because the nature of the change can be positive, negative, or neutral, the actual change in patient health status can correspond to improvement, decline, or stabilization (i.e., no change) in patient condition or functioning. The definition of an outcome does not include a presumed direction; therefore, any deviation (or non-deviation) in health status between the initial time point and the follow -up time point constitutes an outcome. For example, did the patient 's ability to walk and move around improve by the time they finished working with the home health agency? A rate of 88% for that measure means that 88% of the time, the agency improved their patients ' ability to walk and move around. An end-result outcome is a change in patient health status, such as physiologic, functional, cognitive, emotional, or behavioral health, between two or more time points. Examples of end-result outcomes are: Improvement in Ambu lation/Locomotion and Stabilization in Bathing. A utilization outcome is a type of health care utilization (or non-utilization) that reflects (typically a substantial) change in patient health status over time. Examples of utilization outcomes include quality measures that address hospital admission, use of hospital emergency department services, and discharge to the community. Utilization measures were initially computed using only OASIS data; however, there are currently utilization measures that are comp uted using OASIS data and utilization measures computed using Medicare fee-for -service (FFS) claims data. A complete list of quality measures and measure descriptions are available on the CMS Home Health Quality Initiative website. MEASURE EXCLUSIONS F OR OUTCOME MEASURES Some patients are excluded from the improvement or the stabilization computations. Any patient whose status at start (or resumption) of care is optimal for the health attribute under consideration is excluded from the improvement computation. Such a case is excluded because the patient could not possibly show improvement, since he/she is as \"good\" as they can possibly be for this attribute. All the patients included in the improvement computation had the potential to show improvement; the percentage (and the actual number of cases) listed at the end of the bar actually did improve. Similar to exclu sions from the improvement measures, some cases are excluded from the stabilization computation. Any patient whose status at start (or resumption) of care is at the most severely impaired level for the health attribute under consideration is excluded from the stabilization computation. This patient could not possibly show worsening, and therefore is excluded.

Percentage of home health episodes of care during which patients improved or stayed the same in ability to groom self. Number of home health episodes of care where the value recorded on the discharge assessment indicates the same or less impairment in grooming themselves at discharge than at start (or resumption) of care. Items Used to Compute Change: (M1800) Grooming. Items Used to Compute Exclusions: (M1700) Cognitive Functioning (M1710) When Confused (M1720) When Anxious PR OCESS MEASURES Process quality measures evaluate the rate of home health agency use of specific evidence -based processes of care. The standardized home health quality process measures focus on high-risk, high -volume, problem -prone areas for home health care. These include measures pertaining to all or most home care patients, such as timeliness of home care admission /resumption of care and immunizations . Process items represent actions taken by home health care providers that are designed to improve patient outcomes. An example of a process measure is the percentage of home health quality episodes during which patients received the influenza immunization for the current flu season. An agency rate of 72% for that measure means that the agency 's process of caring for patients included the recommended practice in 72% of the included quality episodes. The process items in OASIS have been caref ully developed to represent \" evidence-based\" practice. MEASURE EXCLUSIONS FOR PROCESS MEASURES The majority of the OASIS -based process measures have measure-specific exclusions. Exclusions are specific to each measure. For example, the process measure of \"Influenza Immunization Received for Current Flu Season\" excludes quality episodes in which no care was provided during October 1- March 31, or the patient died, or the patient does not meet age/condition guidelines for influenza vaccine. Quality episodes that are excluded are not counted favorably or unfavorably toward the measure calculation.

As home health quality initiatives have evolved over the years, the OBQI process has also evolved. Today, agencies may select to use other quality improvement methodologies in addition to or in place of OBQI. These may include Six Sigma, Lean Methodology, PDSA (Plan, Do, Study, Act), etc., or agencies may choose to use a combination or variation of methodologies to meet their individual quality improvement needs. Although agencies may not choose to use the original OBQI process, many of the steps within OBQI are relevant to home health quality improvement today. A cyclical and ongoing quality improvement process may include the following steps: 1. Review Quality Measure Reports 2. Select Quality Measures \u2014for focused quality improvement activities 3. Investigate Care Processes (related to measures selected for quality improvement) 4. Develop a Plan of Action (a.k.a. Quality Improvement Plan) 5. Implement the Plan 6. Monitor the Plan 7. Revise/Update the Plan - as needed OASIS items provide the basis for the majority of home health quality measures today. In addition to the OASIS - based quality measures, there are also home health quality measures that are derived from claims data and Home Health CAHPS\u00ae (Consumer A ssessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) data. Some agencies may have access to additional quality measures through their health system or payer affiliations, through other programs, or quality reports generated from their health records. Home health agencies are encouraged to use any of these information sources in systematic efforts to continuously monitor and improve the care provided to their patients. However, CMS cannot provide guidance on data, analysis, or reports from software or data benchmarking from other sources such as software vendors or data benchmarking companies. OASIS Guidance Manual Appendix F OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Appendix F-5 QUALITY EPISODES Quality episodes are used in the calculation of the quality measures.

A quality episode begins with either a start of care or resumption of care assessment and ends with a transfer or discharge assessment. A quality episode does not include recertification(follow -up) assessments and may span payment episodes. A quality episode is measured from: Start of Care to the Transfer OR Start of Care to the Discharge/Death OR Resumpti on of Care to the Transfer OR Resumption of Care to the Discharge/Death. For example, let 's look at a patient who was admitted on 1/1/15 and transferred to an inpatient facility on 1/15/15, then had a resumption of care on 1/20/15 and was discharged from the agency on 2/1/15. In this example, this patient had two quality episodes. The first quality episode began with the start of care on 1/1/15 and ended with the transfer to an inpatient facility on 1/15/15. The second quality episode began with the resumption of care on 1/20/15 and ended with the discharge on 1/31/15. CALCULATING QUALITY MEASURES Measuring quality first begins at the patient -level. Outcome measures indicate the change in patient status from one point in time to another point in time. For the OASIS-based measures, we use the OASIS items for this calculation. To calculate quality measures, we also need to understand the measure definit ion. The measure tables include the measure numerator, denominator, and measure exclusions. EXAMPLE: IMPROVEMENT IN DYSPN EA Measure Definition: T he \"Improvement in Dyspnea\" measure is the \"Percentage of home health episodes of care during which the patient became less short of breath or dyspneic. \" OASIS Item(s) Used in Measure Calculation: The measure is calculated using the OASIS item: (M1400) When is the patient dyspneic? (M1400) When is the patient dyspneic or noticeably Short of Breath? 0 - Patient is not short of breath 1 - When walking more than 20 feet, climbing stairs 2 - With moderate exertion (for example, while dressing, using commode or bedpan, walking distances less than 20 feet) 3 - With minimal exertion (for example, while eating, talking, or performing other ADLs) or with agitation 4 - At rest (during day or night) Measure Exclusions: The first step in calculating measures is to determine the patients that are eligible for the measure. In this example, this measure excludes home health quality episodes of care for which the patient, at start/resumption of care, was not short of breath at any time, and also excludes quality episodes that end with inpatient facility transfer or death. Therefore, for this measure, all patients who at start of care or resumption of care are scored a \" 0 - Patient is not short of breath\" on OASIS are excluded from this measure because the patient cannot improve. If the patient cannot improve, then Improvement in Dyspnea is not computed. Quality episodes that end with death are also excluded and quality episodes that end with a transfer to an inpatient facility are excluded. Quality episodes that are excluded are not counted favorably or unfavorably toward the measure calculation. Improvement: To improve in this measure , a patient must move from a higher numeric score on the OASIS response scale at start of care or resumption of care to a lower numeric score at discharge ( e.g., M1400 start of care score of \"3\" and discharge score of \"2\" would be an improvement). The following table depicts how an individual OASIS Guidance Manual Appendix F OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Appendix F-6 patient 's score at the beginning of a quality episode (start of care or resumption of care) and at the end of a quality episode (discharge for this measure) would be calculated for the Improvement in Dyspnea measure: OASIS RESPONSES & ME ASURE CALCULATION FO R IMPROVEMENT IN DYSPN EA MEASURE Start of Care OR Resumption of Care Discharge Calculation 0 0-4 Excluded 1 0 Improved 1 1-4 Did Not Improve 2 0-1 Improved 2 2-4 Did Not Improve 3 0-2 Improved 3 3-4 Did Not Improve 4 0-3 Improved 4 4 Did Not Improve Agency \"Improvement in Dyspnea \" Observed Rate : In determining the agency rate for each outcome measure, we also need to understand the definitions for the measure numerator and denominator. The numerator for this measure is the number of cases where improvement occurred. In the \"Improvement in Dyspnea\" measure, the numerator is number of home health quality episodes of care where the discharge assessment indicates less dyspnea at discharge than at start (or resumption) of care. The denominator is the entire population ( i.e., patients who improved and who did not improve) for the measure. Therefore, the denominator is every patient in the reporting period that is not excluded from the measure. In the \"Improvement in Dyspnea\" measure, the denominator is the number of home health quality episodes of care ending with a discharge during the reporting period, other than those covered by generic or measure-specific exclusions. (Remember that for the \"Improvement in Dyspnea\" measure, home health quality episodes of care for which the patient, at start/resumption of care, was not short of breath at any time, are excluded from this measure as are quality episodes that end in transfer to an inpatient facility or death. Sample Agency Calculation: If an agency had 100 patients during the reporting period that were discharged from the agency, and 10 of these patients scored \"0\" at start of care/resumption of care on M1400 (and therefore were exclu ded) and 70 of the remaining 90 patients improved in dyspnea (moved from a higher numeric score on M1400 to a lower numeric score), then 70/90 (or 0.777) which equals 77.77% scored favorably or improved in dyspnea. MEASURING STABILIZAT ION In our example, we noted that with improvement in OASIS -based measures, the patient 's status moved from a higher numeric score (at start of care or resumption of care) on the OASIS response scale to a lower numeric score (at discharge). A number of OASIS -based measures are calculated for \"improvement \" and/or \"stabilization. \" For example, there is a measure for \"Improvement in Bathing\" and there is also a measure for \"Stabilization in Bathing. \" How then is \" stabilization\" measured? For the OASIS -based measures, stabilization is calculated as all patients who did not worsen for the measure. Stabilization includes all patients who remain numerically the same on the OASIS response scale (i.e., \"stabilized \") from start of care or resumption of care to discharge AND all patients who improved (moved from a higher numeric score to a lower numeric score). As the stabilization measures include all patients who have stabilized AND all patients who have improved, the measure rates for the stabilization measures are much higher than the corresponding improvement measure rates. For example, the current \"Improvement in Bathing\" national reference rate is approximately 76%. However, the OASIS Guidance Manual Appendix F OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Appendix F-7 current \"Stabilization in Bathing\" national reference rate is approximately 98% as the stabilization rate includes patients who numerically stay the same for OASIS M1830 AND patients who numerically improve in the OASIS M1830 score.

Home Health Review and Correct Report s These reports are available quarterly and updated weekly to provide confidential agency -level performance for quarterly and cumulative performance rates for the OASIS -based publicly reported quality measures . Agencies can use these reports in conjunction with the other CASPER quality measure reports to determine if they have any data submission errors that may affect agency -level performance for one or more of the quality measures. RISK ADJUSTMENT OF Q UALITY MEASURES Change in health status over a time interval during which care is provided (e.g., a quality episode) can occur either as a result of the care provided or the natural progression of disease and disability. The challenge in outcome analysis is to attempt to somehow separate changes due to care from those due to natural progression. Statistical risk adjustment refers to a collection of analytic methods designed to separate the relationships of outcomes with care provided from the relationship of outcomes with natural progression of disease and disability, which is critical to accurate outcome analysis. One of the major purposes of OASIS is to provide data items needed for risk adjustment. In essence, the general intent of risk adjustment is to compensate or adjust for differences in case mix or risk factors (between agency and a comparison sample) that should be taken into consideration if outcomes are to be compared validly. Risk adjustment compensates or controls for the potential influence of case mix variabl es (i.e., risk factors) that can affect outcomes. The OASIS-based quality measures are calculated using items from the OASIS assessments from Medicare FFS, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid and Medicaid Managed care. For a set of these quality measures a logistic regression prediction model is created. Hundreds of risk factors are tested in development of the prediction models. Risk models are measure specific. A rigorous, multi-step process is followed that includes clinical review of the scientifically identif ied risk factors. Hence, the result of applying this prediction model for any episode of care is, in fact, the predicted value based on this logistic regression equation. This value could be described as the probability of obtaining a positive outcome (expected value) given the patient 's clinical and functional status at the start of care. Risk adjustment for home health agencies takes two forms depending upon whether the results are presented to the agency via their private CASPER reports or the results are publicly reported via Home Health Compare. Risk adjustment of an agency 's observed outcome scores was first tested in the mid-1990' s. These risk adjusted values have been reported to HHAs via their CASPER reports beginning in the late 1990 's. Public reporting of home health quality outcomes on Home Health Compare began in August 2003. Because the purpose of these publicly reported results is to provide the public with the ability to compare performance across HHAs rather than within a particular HHA, the HHA 's observed value for an outcome measure is adjusted by the difference between the national and the agency 's predicted values. There are no plans to change the methodology of applying the results from the prediction models for each quality measure to risk adjust the outcome measures for HHAs. Risk adjusted outcome and utilization measures are reported on the CASPER Outcome Reports and on Home Health Compare. Risk adjustment is based on statistical prediction models es timated on a national sample of home health agency patients to predict the likelihood of individual patient outcomes based on patient health status and other attributes at admission to home health care and other attributes. The method used to risk adjust home health agency outcome measures is as follows: The observed outcome rate for the agency is calculated for all eligible patients receiving care from the agency during the most recent 12 month period: Agencyobs= (# of patients achieving outcome)/(# of patients eligible for outcome). For each of the same patients, a predicted outcome probability is calculated based on the statistical risk model and the patient 's condition at admission to home health care. OASIS Guidance Manual Appendix F OASIS- D Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Appendix F- 10 Predicted outcome probabilities are averaged across all of the patients served over a 12 month period, to yield a predicted outcome rate for the agency: Agencypred= (sum of predicted probability)/(# of patients eligible for outcome). National observed and predicted rates are calculated in the same manner for the same 12 month period, by aggregating across all patients served by any home health agency in the United States. The agency rate is risk adjusted by adding to the observed agency rate the difference between the national predicted rate and the agency predicted rate, using the following formula: Agencyra = Agencyobs + (National\u00acpred - Agencypred). If applying the risk adjustment formula results in a number less than zero the risk adjusted rate is set to zero. Similarly, if the result is greater than 100%, it is set to 100%. On the CASPER reports that home health agencies receive, the observed agency outcome rate is reported and the national reference rate is risk adjusted for those OASIS-based outcome measures that are risk adjusted. This is done using the same method as for Home Health Compare, but the following formula is used: National\u00acra = National\u00acobs + (Agencypred - National\u00acpred). A subset of the OASIS-based outcome measures are risk adjusted. The OASIS -based process measures are not risk adjusted. Additional information on home health risk adjustment methodology is available on the CMS Home Health Quality Initiative website and on the Home Health Compare website.
