In brief, Western medicine is primarily an evidence (laboratory)-based science, whereas TCM is more of a healing art based on the theory of Yin and Yang and the five elements in the human body. Therefore, whether TCM and Western medicine could use similar philosophical approaches to treat disease remains unclear. It is well-known that vitamin D enhances immune function and reduces the spread of some viruses. Indeed, recent evidence shows that the blood calcium level is strongly associated with COVID-19 severity, and vitamin D supplementation has shown favorable effects in viral infections. According to TCM theory, the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is closely associated with cold-dampness, an etiological factor in TCM. Cold-dampness could be attenuated by sun exposure and Wenyang herbs, both of which can restore the vitamin D level in the blood in Western medicine. Therefore, TCM and Western medicine could share similar philosophical methods to fight COVID-19 and understanding their philosophical theories could achieve the maximum benefits for treatment of COVID-19 and other diseases.</p>", "sitename": "Aging and disease", "date": "2021-08-01", "cleaned_text": "Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine Share Similar Philosophical Approaches to Fight COVID-19 Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine Share Similar Philosophical Approaches to Fight COVID-19 |Received||Accepted||Published| |2021-04-01||2021-05-12||2021-08-01| "}
