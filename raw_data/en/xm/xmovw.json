Metabonomics is an emerging subject of the post-genome era, which, together with genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics,jointly constitutes the \"Systems Biology \"[1]. It is the branch of science concerned with the quantitative understanding of themetabolite components of integrated living systems and their dy-namic responses to changes in both endogenous (such as thoseassociated with physiology and development) and exogenousfactors (such as environmental factors and xenobiotics) [2]. Thesuccess of the application of metabonomics has been illustratedin the literature from the perspective of the diagnosis of diseasessuch as diabetes [3], hypertension [4], and cancers [5,6]. In recentyears, a wide range of analytical metabonomic techniques havebeen implemented in research addressing TCM whose qualitativeanalysis is difficult because of the complexity and diversity of itscomponents. In general, one or two biomarkers are used for iden-tification and authentication of the herbal products. However,this approach does not provide information on the overall chem-ical composition of the plant extract, which is known to varywidely according to geographical origin, source, cultivar condi-tion, harvesting and processing methods, and storage. Metabo-nomics, through achieving complete scans, addresses the short-falls of single-component analysis. The rapid development of an-alytical instruments is accelerating research on TCM [7]. Addi-tionally, multivariate statistical methods are increasingly im-proving, allowing the implementation of robust solutions [8].Within the TCM practice, the majority of species used are plants.The multi-varieties employed in TCM are the main cause of con-fusion in the herbal medicine market. The identification of thesevarieties, as the first step in the production of Chinese medicinalpreparations, is of great significance for ensuring the safety andeffectiveness of clinical treatment. The quality and contents ofthe active components of herbs are highly variable dependingon the species, parts of the herbs, cultivated geographic region,and planting period involved. Adulterants should be distinguish-able from plant material and play the role of challenging sub-stances. The processing of a characteristic portion, as the secondstep in production, appears to be of significance in clinical appli-cations and has been proven to satisfy the requirements of ther-apeutics. It is essential to unify the degree of processing. In phar-maceutical production, extracts are commonly used. Metabo-nomics can be effectively applied for the quality control of plantextracts.Identifying the plant material, processing, and pharmaceutical production is the sequence of manufacture for Chinese medicinalpreparations. Here we demonstrate the application of metabo-nomics in the discrimination of TCM species, TCM productionprocesses, and quality control. To avoid ambiguities, we also illus-trated the factors affecting the identification step, the methodsused in processing, and the forms of the pharmaceuticals. Analytical Techniques ! In recent years, many metabonomic-based methods have beenimplemented to facilitate research in the field of TCM. In thepharmacopeia, single-component analyses are employed in mostresearch addressing TCM. Nevertheless, the lack of representa-tiveness of single-component analyses seems to account for a de-ficiency of convincing data. Metabonomics, through achievingcomplete scans, addresses the shortfalls of single-componentanalysis.The rapid development of analytical instruments is acceleratingresearch on TCM [7]. Metabonomics measures the multi-para-metric response of biological systems to a stimulus, typically em-ploying analytical technologies such as NMR or MS to obtaincomprehensive profiling and comparison of metabolic \"finger- prints \"[9]. In addition, other chemical analytical equipments and techniques, such as UV and IR spectroscopy were also em-ployed. For biomarker identification, it is also possible to separateout substances of interest on a larger scale from a complex bio-logical system using techniques such as LC, multidimensional liq-uid separation systems, GC, and CE. Especially multidimensionalliquid separation systems have the potential to become a power-ful approach for enriching, separating, and quantifying a large va-riety of exogenous and endogenous compounds in complex bio-logical samples and TCM preparations, with a powerful separa-tion ability, high resolution and sensitivity, high-peak capacity,and excellent detection in comparison with one-dimensionalHPLC. However, every analytical technique has its advantagesand drawbacks, as shown in l \"Table 1 . Multi-analysis techniques can partially overcome the shortcomings of individual analyticaltechniques. It is believed that with the further development ofmetabonomics analysis techniques, especially those employingmulti-analysis, metabonomics will strongly promote TCM re-search and be beneficial to its modernization in terms of extend-ing the application of modern methods in the assessment of TCMFSMWEFA: fixed size moving window-evolving factor analysis HELP: heuristic evolving projection chromatographyUFLC: ultrafast liquid spinning with ESI hybrid linear trap quadrupole orbitrap898 Ning Z et al.

The progress of metabonomics research will be illustrated. First,the proposed TCM component should be extracted. Second, ana-lytical tools should be applied. Third, the chemical profile shouldbe obtained. Combining data under a multivariate data analysis,validating models, molding, and applying diagnostic tools arethe consecutive steps [10] supported by chemometrics andmathematical statistics.Chemometrics are basically classified into two main categories:pattern recognition methods (unsupervised and supervised),when a qualitative evaluation is involved, and multivariate cali-bration for quantitative purposes. Data resulting from metabo-nomics-based work are typically high-dimensional data, requir-ing MVDA methods for interpretation. Most metabonomics dataanalysis methods are based on the classification of samples intodifferent groups (e.g., by treatment or genotype), both via super-vised (e.g., discriminant function analysis or artificial neural net-works) and unsupervised data analysis methods (e.g., PCA orHCA) [11]. It is also possible to use MVDA to conduct regressionmodeling between two blocks of data, usually denoted as X and Y. In metabonomics-based NP studies, X may represent signalsfrom different metabolites present in plant extracts sampled atregular time intervals, while Y represents responses (e.g., thequality of product, bioactivity, or yield). The model then can beused to predict Y from X, which is achieved through new obser-vations. The most common MVDA method employed for this typeof modeling is the PLS method [12]. Recently, OSC, OPLS, were specific methods include SIM-CA, PLS DA, kNN, and ANN. Moreover, PCA and HCA are widely used in metabonomics research.Model validation consists of cross validation, permutation test-ing, and external validation [10]. There are two significant proce-dures: noise filtration and peak matching [15]. Nonlinear noisefiltration is extensively employed, substituting a point with theaverage of the surrounding points so as to filter noise successfully[16]. Matched filtration is another method setting up a standardmode of a peak and comparing its width; a narrower peak is re-garded as noise [17]. Andreev et al. [18] developed MEND, im-proving the identification function. As for peak matching, identi-fying the retention time of the internal standard substance underthe same conditions is the main method employed.The main diagnostic tools applied include score plots, loadingplots, VIP, DModX, and regression coefficients [10]. MetExtract, anew software tool for automated comprehensive extractionof metabolite-derived LC/MS signals in metabonomics research,was recently reported in the literature [19]. Bioactivity and Profiles ! The main research methods of metabonomics are metabolomicfingerprinting and metabolomic profiling analysis. Metabolomicprofiling can be divided into two parts, targeted and nontargetedmetabolic profiling analysis.The targeted metabolic profiling aims to search one biomarker.Several components were usually chosen as marker compoundsto assess the quality. These biomarkers were proved to be constit-uents that discriminate the different species, different parts, dif-ferent cultivated geographic regions, different planting periods,and the processing products. In the present paper, the bioactiv-ities of the biomarkers were obtained via PubChem (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pccompound) and related literatures.However, these few selected markers sometimes are not uniqueto a particular herb since they might be present in many plantsbelonging to various families. In addition, the selection of suitablemarkers is sometimes difficult and subjective. Furthermore,adulterators are continuously trying to develop ways to maketheir products chemical profile similar to the authentic medici- nal herbal product. Under these specific circumstances, themarker approach, on the one hand, is unable to confirm the iden-tity of a specific plant. On the other hand, the influences of theother inner chemicals present may be ignored. Therefore, in somecases, its use may be inappropriate for quality control purposes[20,21]. The objective of \"nontargeted \"analysis is to describe metabolic events by determining all detectable metabolites [22].Of the various profiling techniques, nontargeted analysis usingUPLC -MS is a promising tool for investigating the diversity of phytochemicals [23]. Thus, it is believed that nontargeted meta-bolic profiling analysis will play an important role as an effectivetool in terms of high-throughput elucidation of metabolic pheno-types.Table 1 Comparison of analytical techniques.

The identification of traditional Chinese medicine components plays a key role in ensuring the safety and effectiveness of clinicaltreatments. The quality and contents of the active constituents inherbs are highly variable depending on the species, parts of theplant, cultivated geographic region, and planting period involved.Adulterants are assumed to be distinguishable from plant materi-al and play the role of challenging substances. Therefore, duringlarge-scale production, the identification of these components isof vital significance. Moreover, many applications employed inthe development of metabolic fingerprinting, which will be ex-plained below, using appropriate analysis methods coupled withmultivariate analysis, have been investigated and applied to dis-criminate between closely related plant species in performingquality control assessments of herbal drugs and to identify theirdifferent geographic origins. In addition, analyzing componentsis a robust way to control plant quality.Here, the identification of TCM components can be divided intofour categories: the various species and adulterants, the differentparts of herbs, the planting period and the cultivated geographicregion. Identification of species and adulterants Different species may contain approximately the same compo-nents, while the contents of these components vary, which influ-ence the therapeutic effect. Two leguminous plants, (Fish.) Bge, are important medical herbs that share great similarities regarding their morphology, chemi-cal constituents, and genomic DNA sequences. The identificationof different medicinal species directly affects their pharmacolog-ical and clinical effects. Amplified AFLP-based genetic finger-printing and GC -TOF/MS-based metabolic fingerprinting were used to successfully discriminate between the two species. Thedifferences in some soluble sugars, fatty acids, proline, andpolyamine reflected the plants adaptation to different growth environments. Using multivariate and univariate statistical anal-yses, three AFLP markers and eight metabolites were identified ascandidate DNA and metabolic markers to distinguish betweenthe two herb materials [24]. In another study, metabolite profil-ing of five medicinal Panax herbs, which included P. ginseng (Chi- nese ginseng), P. notoginseng, P. japonicus, P. quinquefolium L., and P. ginseng (Korean ginseng), was performed using UPLC-QTOFMS and multivariate statistical analysis techniques. PCA of the ana-lytical data showed that the five Panax herbs could be separated into five different groups of phytochemicals [25]. HPLC finger-printing was used for comparison Pericarpium Citri (Citrus reticulata 'Chachi and as potential biomarkers fortheir classification [26]. In a similar case, PCA and HCA as well asSIMCA and a BP ANN were applied to identify and distinguish Epimedium wushanense andEpimedium koreanum based on their secondary metabolites. The SIMCA method failed to identify onesample, whereas BP ANN precisely predicted the whole test set [27]. PCA was able to discriminate between ten Aristolochia spe- cies on the basis of their essential oil profiles, showing that 2 h ofhydrodistillation produce the best outcome when the oils areused for discriminating between species [28]. Coincidentally,Sun et al. [29] drew on the same plant. In the Chinese Pharmaco-poeia 2010, only two Aconitum species are recorded. One is the root of Aconitum kusnezoffii Reichb., namely species was Aconitum carmichaelii Debx. Two herbal drugs are derived from this species. The two species were distin-guished successfully using UPLC -QTOF -HDMS, combining with PCA and S-plot. Moreover, a PCA score plot clearly demonstrateddiscrimination between Artemisia annua and Artemisia afra quinic acid, and ferulic acid) [30]. Spectral fingerprintingvia NIR has been utilized for the rapid identification and counter-feit detection of Eleutherococcus senticosus , and PCA, DA, SIMCA, and PLS DA were found to allow good discrimination between E. senticosus and other herbs both related to and not related to the Araliaceae family [31]. PCA has been successfully applied for dis-tinguishing Angelica sinensis from related Apiaceae (syn. Umbel- on HPLC fingerprints [32]. Thesame were recognized by tion of authentic Pericarpium Citri from commercial [33]. 1HNMR spec- troscopy and multivariate species ( B. chinense andB. scorzonerifolium ) and to explore the influences of habitat and culture methods onthe quality of Radix Bupleuri plants based on their metabonomicprofiles The quality Radix Bupleuri plants was evaluatedvia analysis and HPTLC analysis of theirprincipal bioactive components (saikosaponins). The acquireddata were processed using ANNs and kNN to distinguish betweendifferent species of the genus [35]. DART MS provides a novel mass spectrometric ion source by producing [M + H] +molecular ion species. In analyses of Glycyrrhiza inflata Batalin, the peak at m/z339 originates mainly from the [M + H]+of LA, a species-spe- cific compound. These results indicate that G. inflata can be dif- ferentiated from the other two species based on detection of LApeaks using DART MS analysis [36]. In addition, chromatographic fingerprinting via GC MS coupled with SA and PCA has been undertaken for discriminating Scutellaria barbata D. Don from adulterants. The results showed that the samples could be identi-fied based on differences between the samples and various adul-terants [37]. Similarity analysis and HCA were applied for the firsttime to identify and distinguish genuine Aconitum kusnezoffii from its adulterants, which demonstrated the feasibility of link-ing the HCA approach to chemotaxonomic analysis on the basisof the presence of alkaloids [38]. To discriminate and assess thequality of Curcuma phaeocaulis, C. kwangsiensis ,a n d C. wenyujin from different ecotypes, a metabonomics analysis was carriedout via GC MS coupled with multivariate statistical analysis. Characterization of phytochemicals in essential oils was per-formed by automated matching to the MS library and comparisonof their mass spectra, which discriminated among the differentplant parts [39]. Curcuma plants, such as Curcuma wenyujin Y.H. Chen et C. Ling and Curcuma longa L., were also distinguished successfully via HPLC DAD MS [40]. Identification of different medicinal parts of herbs The choice of different parts of herbs determines the resulting cu- rative effect, which is the purpose of therapy. The contents of theactive components of diverse plant parts were identified. In thelong history of the use of medicinal plant preparations, differentplant parts have been regarded as different drugs. R. Juri iGru- beiet al. [41] identified the variation in total polyphenol con- tents, employing Folin -Ciocalteu s reagent, between different parts of Plantago plants (leaves: up to 10.15%; stems: up to900 Ning Z et Application of Plant ...Planta Med 2013; 79: 897 -908Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. 4.34%; and flowers: up to 5.56%). The content of tannins in stems ranged from 0.28% to 1.00%, while leaves and flowers containedtannins at concentrations of 2.26% and 2.21% based on UV -Vis spectrophotometry.Metabolite profiling of different parts of Panax notoginseng was carried out using UPLC -ESIMS and multivariate statistical analy- sis. PCA of the UPLC -ESIMS data showed a clear separation of the compositions among the flower buds, roots, and rhizomes ofP. notoginseng. The saponins accounting for these variations were identified based on corresponding loading weights and were fur-ther verified based on the accurate mass, tandem mass, and re-tention time of available standard saponins using UPLC - QTOF MS [42]. Moreover, each extract from 24 mulberry leaf samples, divided into six locations from the tip of the stem ineach of four strains, was analyzed via pattern recognition meth-ods, including PCA and SIMCA. The 24 extracts from mulberryleaves showed independent spectra in 1HNMR analyses [43]. Aconitum carmichaelii Debx., another example for the application of plant metabonomics in the discrimination of different parts ofherb plants, was studied by Sun et al. [29]. The mother root isnamed \"Chuanwu \", while the daughter or lateral root of Aconi- tum carmichaelii Debx. is known as \"Shengfuzi \". Shengfuzi has been prescribed more frequently than Chuanwu to treat rheu-matic diseases. The analytical techniques, UPLC -QTOF -HDMS, as well as the data processing methods, PCA, and S-plot, werethe main measures in this study. Differentiation of distinct cultivated geographic regions The environments of the cultivated geographic regions of medic-inal plants, including their temperature, humidity, soil, and cli-mate, are determinant factors. Therefore, the cultivated geo-graphic region influences the growth of herbs. Wei-Jun Kong etal. [44] utilized UPLC PAD analysis to examine the five active al- kaloids in Rhizoma Coptidis Chinensis, successfully grouping theplants in accordance with their province of origin. Moreover, theLSSVM, RBF ANN, PLS DA, and kNN methods were applied for the classification of Rhizoma Corydalis, and in general, no statis-tically significant differences were found between these fourmethods. NIRS was used to identify Rhizoma Corydalis plantsfrom two different geographical origins [45]. Another exampleof the application of the HCA technique was its use for the classi-fication of Isatis indigotica roots collected from different regions based on HPLC fingerprinting [46]. Ganoderma lucidum samples from different evaluated us-ing HPLC fingerprinting. The HCA, PCA, PLS DA, and SIMCA niques were employed to classify samples in accordance withtheir province of origin [47]. In addition, the essential oils of theCinnamon Cortex specimens obtained from different localitieshave been analyzed via GC MS [48]. Furthermore, the volatile oils of Artemisia capillaris Herba from different locations were inves-tigated through GC MS to develop a characteristic fingerprint of this raw herb [49]. The discrimination of Schizonepeta tenuifolia Briq. from different origins has also been achieved via PCA andHCA, which classified the samples into two main groups on thebasis of five marker compounds [50]. It is also worth noting thatthe combination of NIR spectroscopy with DA and PLS DA analy- sis was applied in geographical origin discrimination for RadixScutellaria [51]. A nontargeted from pattern recognition analysis and identifica- tion of secondary metabolites responsible for differences in sam-ple composition. For this purpose, plants from three differentgeographic areas (the Swiss Alps, Finland, and the Altai region in Siberia) were investigated [52]. Furthermore, quantitative esti-mates of the major isoflavones in Pueraria lobata were produced, and the studied samples were classified through PCA based onthe amounts of puerarin, daidzin, daidzein, and genistin was applied in an attempt to eval-uate the quality of dried Angelica acutiloba roots. An enhanced understanding of the dominance of the relationship of the culti-vation area with the evaluated quality was conceptualized andapplied to the construction of a PLS DA classification model, which provided the basis for accurate and reliable predictivity[54]. Additionally, PCA was performed using the data generatedthrough HPLC DAD-ELSD analysis for quality control of Polygala japonica from different localities in China [55]. Recently, Suzuki et al. [56] classified Sophora flavescens grown in Japan and China via NMR. Differentiation of distinct planting periods The planting period is also a vital factor in the quality of a crudedrug due to the duration over which a plant obtains nutritionfrom the soil.An UPLC QTOF MS-based for metabolite profiling in 60 Panax ginseng samples aged from 1 to 6 years [57]. Ginseng is an important herbal resource world-wide, and adulteration or falsification of the cultivation age hasbeen a serious problem for ginseng in the commercial market. Inthis study, ginseng roots cultivated for 2 -6 years under good agri- cultural practices standard guidelines were analyzed via NMR-based metabolomics techniques using two solvents [58]. More-over, it has been demonstrated that July might be the best harvesttime for Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae Viride , based on PCA loadings. The HPLC -HELP -PCA strategy has shown potential in the optimization of harvest times[26]. Recently, Xue et al. [59] utilized GC MS to investigate the flower buds of Tussilago farfara in different development stages. Collectively, medicinal herbs from different species and the dif-ferent parts of the same plant usually exhibit different efficacy,pharmacological actions, and clinical indications due to the sig-nificant differences in the types and quantity of the constituents.The species diversity seems to be a significant factor to influencethe quality assessment. In addition, chemical constituents of thesame plant may be various due to different cultivation areas, cli-matic conditions, and cultivation ages. For example, ginseng ofcultivation ages from 4 to 6 years is the most demanded ginsengin the market. However, age and cultivation areas can hardly bedetermined by the herb s physical appearance alone. Accordingly, confused clinical application led to the consumption of incorrectforms of plant material, improper use, and undesirable effects.Hence, an effective method applied in quality control is urgentlydemanded for the identification step of medicinal herbs. Sincesome samples share similarities in morphology but with subtlevariations in certain ingredients, metabonomics can provide aplatform to use analytical techniques coupled with multivariatestatistics for the differentiation of these complex samples. Me-tabonomics information not only assist in the establishment of adeeper understanding of the complex interactive nature of plantmetabolic networks and their responses to environmentalchange but also provide unique insights into the fundamental na-ture of plant phenotypes in relation to development, physiology,tissue identity, resistance, biodiversity, and so on. To make them901 Ning Z et al. Application of Plant ...Planta Med 2013; 79: 897 -908Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. clear, the plant material, analysis technique, chemometrics meth- ods, biomarkers, and bioactivity aspects are summarized in l\"Ta- ble 2 . Processing ! Processing is the second step in the production of Chinese medic- inal preparations. TCM-specific production steps include storing,washing, rinsing, drying, remoistening, and cutting, and eventu-ally, unique processing techniques, such as stir frying, steaming,or calcining are performed to satisfy different clinical therapeuticrequirements. First, the effect of processing is thought to enhancethe therapeutic efficiency in Sophora japonica L. [60]. Drug pro- cessing can also weaken the structure of plants so that the activecomponents can be extracted easily. Additionally, additives reactwith the compounds present in plants generating new compo-nents dissolved in solvents. For instance, alkaloids dissolve in ac-idic solvents, so vinegar is widely applied to crude drugs to enrichalkaline substances. Second, processing has been reported to re-duce the toxicity of the crude drugs, as described with Fuzi [61].As evidence has accumulated, it has been shown that poisonousprotein is one of the causes of accidental side effects. As proteinsare thermo-sensitive, crude drugs should be subjected to heattreatment. Third, the expansion of applications is another impor-tant unexpected impact. Finally, after processing, the generationof several new compounds has been reported [62]. However, thedosage of additives and the time of heat treatment should be con-sidered during processing, as they are the major factors that af-fect quality control.In the large-scale production, it is difficult to guarantee the pu-rity of all products. Researchers spend long periods finding solu-tions to quality control. The development of metabonomics hasprovided a necessary way to understand cellular responses tomutations at all levels of gene products [63]. In recent years, awide range of metabonomic analytical techniques have been im-plemented in research on TCM [64]. Several cases illustrate thepossibilities of the application of metabonomics in quality con-trol during the processing of TCM materials. Ginseng has beenemployed in TCM for over two thousand years and is now widelyused around the world as an elixir [63]. In Asia, there are twotypes of ginseng that are commonly found in the herbal medicinemarket: WG and RG. In the practice of traditional Chinese medi-cine, WG and RG have been used for different purposes. WG istraditionally produced via sun drying of fresh ginseng, and RG ismanufactured by steaming fresh ginseng at 95 -100\u00b0C for 2 -3h and then drying it. WG is used to \"supply qi and promote the production of body fluids \"as well as enhance physical fitness and disease resistance, while RG has a \"warming effect \"and is used constituents of RG [65 - 72]. These unique ginsenosides found in RG have been reportedto be converted from the ginsenosides found in fresh ginsengafter steaming [70,73,74]. In one study, ginseng was processedunder temperatures of 100, 140, and 180\u00b0C, with or without vin-egar; the duration of exposure to each temperature was 10, 30,and 50 min, respectively, and there was a clear separation in thescore plots obtained for the various treatment conditions. Themajor compounds contributing to the separation of 50% metha-nol extracts of vinegar-treated ginseng subjected to various pro-cessing valine, lactate, alanine, arginine, glucose, fructose, valine,arginine, glucose, fructose, and sucrose concentrations de-creased, whereas lactate, glucose, samples compared to non-vinegar-treated sam-ples [62]. Moreover, UPLC/TOFMS had been demonstrated to bea powerful tool for use in herbal metabonomics to discriminatedifferentially processed herbs, such as raw and steamed P. noto- ginseng [75]. An UHPLC TOF MS-based metabonomics platform coupled PCA and PLS DA was developed for Panax notogin- seng to establish a correlation between the duration of steaming and the maximum production of bioactive ginsenosides [76]. Asimilar study was performed to determine chemical markers fordiscriminating between raw and processed Radix Rehmanniaesamples [77]. In addition, the three types of products obtainedfrom the processing of Ligustrum lucidum fruits have been distin- guished, which correspond to steam treatment processing prod-ucts, vinegar treatment processing products, and the fruits pro-cessed with wine. There are differences in metabolite profilesamong the crude and different types of processed fruits ofL. lucidum . Ligustaloside B was identified as a chemical marker for such variations, and its contents in crude L. lucidum speci- mens were found to be significantly higher than in processedsamples. This study indicated that UPLC-QTOF MS coupled with multivariate statistics is able to provide quality control for thecrude and processed fruits of L. lucidum , and these results pro- vide the basis for determining the appropriate mechanism of pro-cessing [78]. The products of the processing of Polygala Radixwere also successfully distinguished [79]. One study was de-signed to perform a comprehensive metabonomics analysis ofFuzi and its processed products, Yanfuzi, Heishunpian, and Baifu-pian, via UPLC QTOF-HDMS combined with pattern recognition methods. Differences in the metabolic profiles of Fuzi and its pro-cessed preparations were clearly observed based on PCA of theobtained MS spectra. Significant changes in 19 metabolite bio-markers were detected in the Fuzi samples and the three prepa-rations [61]. Similarity analysis and PCA were applied to addressthe issue of the various quality changes that occur during the pro-cess of toasting Fructus Xanthii supplied by different producingareas. A high similarity was observed between different samples,which indicates that the proportion and distribution of the com-ponents in most extracts of F. xanthii show a high level of consis- tency [80]. HPLC fingerprints together with metal profiles wereemployed to assess the quality control procedures applied toAtractylis chinensis . A separate data matrix and combined data matrices were analyzed via PCA, kNN, and LDA. The PCA resultsfrom the combined data matrices indicated that the sampleswere discriminated on the basis of the applied processing meth-ods. Within each group, the samples were reasonably wellgrouped according to their geographical origin and classificationusing kNN, and LDA results supported the PCA results [81].As the raw and processed forms of herbs have different pharma-cological actions, it is pertinent to administer the correct form ofherb to avoid any undesirable consequences. Even the duration ofthe processing procedure, the processing adjuvants, and its dos-age arouse the subtle changes in the contents of compounds.Therefore, it is of paramount importance to characterize the spe-cific forms.

The last step in the production of Chinese medicinal prepara- tions, obtaining plant extracts, can also be subjected to qualitycontrol using metabonomic profiles. The extract is a contributingfactor to the quality and toxicity of the drug produced. However,a prerequisite is that the extracts of intermediate products thatare to be analyzed are well documented with regard to the pro-duction steps they have been subjected to. Bioactive compoundsmay be identified if it is possible to obtain or generate extracts ofdifferent materials from the same plant species that are highlyvariable in bioactivity. PCA may then be used to discriminate thechemical fingerprints of the extracts in a way that separates themby their activity or by spatial origin, and relevant chemical com-pounds can subsequently be deduced from their contributions tothe respective fingerprints [82,83]. The majority of TCM productsfor oral use are applied as water decoctions [84]. Other oral prep-arations include macerates in aqueous ethanol and powdered drugs suspended in water or prepared in pills, with honey, water,or rice gruel as an excipient [85,86]. An HPLC fingerprinting anal-ysis was developed to assess the quality and comparative con-tents of cinnamon bark and cinnamon twig components. PCAand PLS DA allowed good discrimination of these samples, and cinnamaldehyde was found to be the most abundant markercomponent [87]. Several examples are found in the literature ofutilizing HPLC together with different chemometric methods forthe analysis of complex mixtures, including the resolution ofHPLC fingerprints of complex, many-component substancesfound in Huoxiang Zhengqi tincture samples from a batch froma given manufacturer, or from different producers [88]. Anotherexample of investigating complex mixtures is the analysis of ninebioactive compounds from a Yiqing preparation which is com-posed of three TCMs, to assess the consistency of the qualityamong 12 manufacturers based on SA.

HPLC fingerprinting could serve as the first tool for revealing the consistency of the quality of Yiqing via similarity comparisons[89]. LC LTQ-Orbitrap MS was applied for simultaneous and quantification of multi-constituent Xin-Ke-Shu, aTCM preparation [90].It is complicated during the pharmaceutical process. On the onehand, the pharmaceutical excipients hold back the analysis. Onthe other hand, a Chinese patent drug usually consists of manysorts of herbs; the constituents analysis is a bottleneck in quality control. Plant metabonomics, a platform aimed at the complexingredients, can help to better understand the nature of theseproblems. Conclusions and Perspectives ! Plant metabonomics can be applied in the discrimination, pro-cessing, and pharmaceutical preparation steps of TCM products,which represent the entire production process ( l \"Table 2 ). As the first step in the production of Chinese medicinal prepara-tions, the identification of plant varieties used, involving species,parts of the herbs, cultivated geographic region, and planting pe-riod, is of great significance for ensuring the safety and effective-ness of clinical treatment since the quality and contents of the ac-tive constituents depend on these factors. Adulterants are as-sumed to be distinguishable from plant materials and play therole of challenging substances. The processing, as the second stepin production, appears to be of significance in clinical applica-tions and has been proven to satisfy the requirements of thera-peutics. As different forms of TCMs show different pharmacolog-ical actions, it is pertinent to administer the correct form of herbsto avoid any undesirable consequences. Therefore, it is of para-mount importance to characterize the specific form of TCM. Me-tabonomics can also be applied to control the content of extracts,which is crucial to the pharmaceutical production. The complex-ity and diversity of the components of TCM preparations makequalitative analyses difficult. In the pharmacopeia, single-com-ponent analysis is used on TCM mostly. Nevertheless, it lacks rep-resentativeness. In contrast to single-component analyses, me-tabonomics achieves comprehensive scans, addressing some ofthe shortfalls of single-component analysis. As shown by thethree points we have just illustrated, plant metabonomics canplay a vital role in quality assessments during the large-scaleproduction of TCM preparations.To facilitate the application of plant metabonomics in the qualityassessment, on the one hand, we are supposed to utilize the newand effective techniques so that they will support metabonomicsstudies adequately. On the other hand, exploring potential re-search points of metabonomics in TCM seems necessary. Withthe appearance of RRLC and UFLC, the methods of analysis cometo a new era. Shorter analysis time and the more efficient separa-tion are the advantages of these methods [91]. MAS NMR, anoth- er sharp technique, enhances the resolution of solid samples andplays an important role in the overlap of peaks [92]. Cristina Dao-lio et al. [93] applied MAS NMR classifying commercial catuaba successfully. An LC MSNMR platform was demonstrated, which combines two innovations in microscale analysis, nanoSplitterLCMS and microdroplet NMR, for the identification of unknown compounds found at low concentrations in complex sample ma-trixes as frequently encountered in metabonomics or naturalproduct discovery [94]. Therefore, in the future, employing newand effective chromatographic or spectroscopic techniques formetabonomics studies seems to be an important tendency. What concerns exploring potential research points, in recent years, me-tabonomics was reported to the study of pharmacology in someterms. Employing a metabonomics platform, Yiqing Lin et [94]identified the active cyanobacterial metabolite. Kashif Ali et al.[95] also managed to screen the anti-TNF activity in crude ex- tracts of grapes and other berries by NMR spectroscopy and che-mometric. Using this approach, compounds related to activitycan be identified without extensive and elaborate chromato-graphic separation, and it thus allows rapid identification of ex-tracts with biological activity. Moreover, screening the activecompounds and effective parts seems to grow into a vital processin future studies. As a consequence, the results of quantitative as-says will become more instructive and convincing. In a word,with the development of analysis methods and the explorationof potential research points, the application of metabonomics inTCM quality assessment tends to become more prevalent andconsidered in the future.
