The Office of Spiritual Development fosters spiritual transformation through programs and ministries that include faith formation, service opportunities, pastoral care, and leadership development. Faith Formation Chapel Students may learn what it means to be in a relationship with Christ or dive deeper into their personal faith journey through chapel experiences and worship on campus. Discipleship Groups In addition to chapel, one of the most important opportunities for spiritual growth in our community is through small group discipleship. A small group provides an opportunity for more genuine and authentic discussions that are often not possible in a larger group setting. We believe that the spiritual growth which can take place in small groups is so important that we will be providing a full chapel credit for participation. Small groups can take many forms. They can be in-person or remotely through a conferencing platform like Zoom. They can focus on a topic, book, or scripture of your group's choosing. We will also support you in helping you think through what you want your group to look like & what your focus will be. In other words, we want to provide a lot of freedom and flexibility for you to create or find a small group that is interesting to you and will be most beneficial for your spiritual growth. If you would like your small group meetings to count for chapel credit, we do ask that your group's leader would be approved by the Office of Spiritual Development and report to us regularly about how your group is doing. If you would be interested in leading a small group, please complete the application on the Spiritual Development Canvas Course or reach out to iela.galiano-williams@enc.edu. Service Opportunities FUSION Short Term Missions The FUSION program is designed to give students an opportunity to connect with the activity of God in contexts which cause them to cross a boundary of difference. In 2019, a San Diego-Tijuana Fusion team partnered with an organization called Global Immerse to experience the immigrant's journey, delving into the human and social issues affecting immigrant families in the U.S. Another FUSION team traveled to Puerto Rico where they helped local leaders rebuild communities devastated in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. In 2018 and 2019, teams sent to Zambia, led by psychology professor Dr. Catherine Bell and soccer coach Mark Bell, assisted a Christian relief agency provide food, bed nets, school visits, and home visits to those affected with HIV/AIDS.

For more information, contact Lisa Michaels at lisa.michaels@enc.edu Summer Ministries Student-led summer ministry teams travel to camps and churches on the east coast, a long-standing tradition and valuable experiential learning for those interested. Each summer, the college sends out teams of students to represent the school and serve as ministers on the Eastern Field for the Church of the Nazarene and other Christian camps and retreat centers. These teams are chosen in the fall and sent out from June through August. For more information about Summer Ministries, contact Assistant Director of Undergraduate Admissions Madisen Fernandez at madisen.fernandez@enc.edu. Pastoral Care College is an exciting time for students, but it can also be difficult for some students. The Office of Spiritual Development is dedicated to supporting students during their entire time at Eastern Nazarene College. If you are in need of spiritual guidance, pastoral counseling, or just someone to talk to, please feel free to reach out to someone in our office and we can schedule a time to meet with you.
