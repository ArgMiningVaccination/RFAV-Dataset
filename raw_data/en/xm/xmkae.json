The typical sponsor for a Medical Doctor's J1 Visa is the ECFMG. A J1 visa is not for employment outside of a formal training program. - H1B Visas are intended for those who are performing a specialized service or occupation. These Visas are usually sponsored by hospitals or a particular employer. - The LSBME works with the United States INS to grant interlocking letters to obtain an effective date for the H1B Visa. The effective date of the Visa will be the effective date of the Louisiana license or permit issued by the LSBME. - The applicant's employer usually needs a valid LSBME license to complete the credentialing process for hospitals, insurance companies, and professional liability insurers. Therefore, the licensure applicant should work with the United States INS Visa sponsor to set the effective date for the Visa.

Notarization as a \"true copy\" Request the notary to certify a copy of your birth certificate and/or marriage certificate as a \"true and correct copy of the original\".
