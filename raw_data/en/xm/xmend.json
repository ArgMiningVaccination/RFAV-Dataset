This may be due to the rising age of parenthood across the globe, environmental issues, or a slew of other issues. Conventional infertility treatments can be extremely expensive and complicated, so many who struggle with infertility seek alternative solutions that are more manageable. As a result, we're seeing growing interest in homeopathic or natural fertility treatments, such as acupuncture, reflexology, or herbal supplements. While there remains some skepticism about these therapies and their effectiveness in improving fertility, a growing body of research supports the impact they can have.

When used to [treat infertility](https://americanpregnancy.org/infertility/acupuncture/), it can help by balancing hormones, relieving stress, or boosting blood flow to the reproductive organs.

Typically, reflexology would be used alongside good nutrition and lifestyle changes to clear toxins from the body, boost the immune system, and improve sleep. These changes ultimately reduce stress hormones, which has been shown to [contribute to infertility](https://www.ovusense.com/eu/blog/14-factors-that-can-negatively-affect-ovulation-and-your-fertility/).
