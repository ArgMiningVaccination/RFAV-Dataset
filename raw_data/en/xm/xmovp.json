This season brings a sense of routine \u2014 as kids settle back into their classrooms and childcare settings. Yet there are some new changes this year, as families weigh an important decision. The COVID-19 vaccine became authorized for children ages 6 months and older in June. Since the authorization, over [1.5 million](https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-vaccination-trends/) U.S. children ages 6 months to 4 years of age have received at least one dose. Many more children in this age group are unvaccinated, putting them at a higher risk of getting, and spreading, COVID-19. We spoke with Dr. Tao Sheng Kwan-Gett, Chief Science Officer at the Washington State Department of Health (DOH), about the vaccine for young children. Before coming to DOH, Dr. Kwan-Gett was a primary care pediatrician \u2014 where he discussed important topics like vaccination with his patients. Thanks for joining us, Dr. Kwan-Gett. Let's start with a big question. Is the vaccine safe for young children under the age of five? The COVID-19 vaccine is very safe for kids under five. Before a vaccine gets FDA authorized it goes through three phases of [clinical trials](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-moderna-and-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccines-children) that look at dosage, side effects, safety (meaning it has a low risk of severe adverse reactions) and effectiveness. The FDA doesn't give authorization unless the manufacturer has proven that the vaccine is safe and effective. By the time the vaccine for younger children was authorized, thousands of children had already safely received it in clinical trials. What would you say to a parent who fears long-term side effects of the vaccine? The first thing I would say is that I'm so glad that they're being very thoughtful about this decision. It's really important for parents to have a good understanding of vaccines, including the risks and benefits. Next, I would encourage them to get accurate information about the scientific data. The benefits of getting a child vaccinated far outweigh the risks. It reduces the chances of severe illness and long-term complications from COVID-19. Finally, if they still have concerns I'd advise them to talk to their primary care provider or someone on their care team. They can be a great source of accurate information on vaccines. Are there any potential risk factors from vaccination? Nearly all side effects to the COVID-19 vaccine we see are mild. A child may have mild soreness where the vaccine was administered, or occasionally, a low-grade fever. In the studies of COVID-19 vaccine in younger children that CDC looked at to develop its recommendations, serious adverse events were very rare (less than 1-2%) and actually occurred at about the same rate in vaccine and placebo groups, so in some cases may not have been related to the [vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7126e2.htm). No vaccine or medication is free of risk, just as many routine daily activities have risk, like taking your child for a drive in a car. But we recognize that there are things we can do to decrease our risk \u2014 like driving safely and using a car seat. Though we know that car accidents happen \u2014 some minor, some serious \u2014 we take that small risk of using a car because we believe that the benefits outweigh the risks. It's similar with the COVID-19 vaccine for kids. It's not risk free, side effects can happen \u2014 usually minor, very rarely serious \u2014 and the benefits of getting vaccinated far outweigh the risks. If you ask pediatricians and public health professionals who have kids, they are all very eager to get their kids vaccinated. If there was data showing the benefits did not outweigh the risks, they would not get their kids vaccinated. That's an interesting way to look at it. We sometimes forget that many pediatricians and medical professionals are parents who also weigh these decisions for their own families. Exactly. My daughter was a teenager at the start of the pandemic, so she wasn't eligible for the vaccine right away. As soon as she became eligible, we made sure that she got vaccinated, and then later on boosted. So when parents ask me as a pediatrician what I recommend, I tell them that I feel so confident in the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, I made sure that my own \"team\" (my family) got vaccinated. I encourage parents to be really open with their pediatrician or primary care provider about any questions or concerns they have. Would you say it's still worth it for a child to get vaccinated if case counts are going down? Definitely. Case counts had been doing down since the mid- summer, but then there was a bump in cases in September and there are concerns that we'll see increases in the fall and winter. But regardless of what today's case counts show, it's still important to get your child vaccinated for a couple of reasons. First, it's quite possible that a new variant of COVID-19 could occur and begin to spread throughout our communities. For instance, Omicron started in another part of the world, and then spread, and became the dominant strain in the United States. A similar event could happen with a new variant or subvariant. If your child is up to date on vaccines and boosters, they're going to be much better protected against any new variants that come up. Adults and kids 5 years and older are now eligible for the new bivalent booster that just came out, which promises to give even better protection against newer variants than previous vaccines. Another reason is that even though the risk of getting COVID-19 is lower, it is still present. By getting your child vaccinated you can protect your child from a potential illness, and from spreading it to others in the family and in their circles. This is especially important if they are around people who have a chronic condition that places them in a high risk for severe infection. That might be an older grandparent or even a classmate who is immunocompromised. You mentioned the research is important for determining the dosage for each age group. How does the doses vary across age groups? Different manufacturers have they taken different approaches. Both Pfizer and Moderna are using a lower dose version of the adult vaccine, but the exact amount varies. For the Pfizer vaccine, children ages 6 months through 4 years old receive a dose that's just a tenth of the dose used in the formulation for adolescents 12 years and older and adults; these younger kids need three doses to complete their primary series. Children ages 5 through 11 receive just one third of the dose compared to adolescents and adults, and need two doses for their primary series. For the Moderna vaccine, children ages 6 months through 5 years receive 2 doses that are a quarter of the dose of the adolescent/adult vaccine, while children ages 6 through 12 receive a half concentration dose, also in two doses. How far apart should you schedule the doses for your young child? It depends on the [vaccine manufacturer](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html%22%20/l%20%22:~:text=The%20first%20and%20second%20doses,-BioNTech%20primary%20series.). For Moderna, an interval of 4-8 weeks is recommended between the first and second dose. For Pfizer, an interval of 3-6 weeks is recommended between the first and second dose. Remember, Pfizer is a 3-dose vaccine for this age group. It's recommended to get the third dose 8 weeks after the second. I recommend scheduling the next dose while you're at your first dose appointment. How does COVID-19 impact unvaccinated children? There is a misconception that COVID-19 is always a mild illness for children. Fortunately, the vast majority of kids who get COVID-19 recover from it, just as they do from other respiratory viruses that cause infections of the respiratory tract (like the common cold and the flu). But there is a risk of serious consequences from COVID-19 for kids. While it's a smaller risk than for adults, it's definitely still there. There is a risk of hospitalization. There's also a risk of a very severe reaction of the immune system called [multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children](https://www.cdc.gov/mis/index.html%22%20/l%20%22:~:text=What%20is%20MIS%3F,%2C%20eyes%2C%20or%20gastrointestinal%20organs) (MIS-C), which may require ICU care. Kids can also have [long COVID](/wadepthealth/a-doctor-discusses-what-to-know-about-long-covid-9af7ea3b62ce), which can last for months and even years after infection. And while it's rare, there still is the small risk of death, which in children is higher for COVID-19 than it is for the flu. Since the start of the pandemic, the [CDC estimates](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Deaths-by-Sex-Ages-0-18-years/xa4b-4pzv) that more than 500 children age four and younger have died from COVID-19. That's why it's so important to get kids up to date on the COVID-19 vaccine. From what you've seen, has the vaccine helped protect kids who received it? Yes, [studies](https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/why-parents-should-get-kids-under-5-vaccinated-against-covid-19) show that the vaccine decreases the risk of infection for children 4 years and younger. For older kids studies have shown that the vaccine decreases the risk of hospitalization and also decreases the risk of MIS-C. The vaccine also decreases the risk of [long COVID](/wadepthealth/a-doctor-discusses-what-to-know-about-long-covid-9af7ea3b62ce) in older children. We're looking forward to seeing what the studies show for how well the vaccine protects against serious illness for younger children. Thinking about variants, could children be more vulnerable to new variants? That's hard to say. Every variant is different. The more recent variants of the pandemic seemed to impact children more than the earlier variants did. We really just don't know what the future holds in store in terms of what variants may appear, and how severe of an illness they might cause for kids. Because of that uncertainty, it's wise to make sure that your kids are vaccinated and boosted and stay up to date. Should young children who already had COVID-19 still get vaccinated? Is there any natural immunity? Yes! The thing about immunity from a COVID-19 infection is that it's quite variable. There might be two kids who get infected with COVID-19, and they might be identical in terms of their health and in terms of the severity of infection. One child might end up having very durable immunity that can protect them against a future infection for the next several months while the other child might not. There's no way of knowing how strong the protection is. There's no blood test that can measure protection. That's why we recommend vaccination for kids, even if they've gotten COVID-19, because it takes away some of the guess work and uncertainty. If your child did have COVID, you may choose to wait a few months after their infection for your child's initial vaccine or booster, as there may be a period of natural immunity. With kids back in school, parents might be catching up on other vaccines. Does the COVID-19 vaccine need to be scheduled around any routine vaccinations? COVID-19 vaccines can be given at the same time as other routine childhood vaccines, including the flu vaccine. In fact, now is the perfect time to get the entire family vaccinated against the flu. You can always ask your pediatrician about any potential concerns. How can parents prepare their child for a positive vaccine experience? One way is to be very reassuring and calm yourself. Children can pick up on your stress. Another thing you can do is be matter of fact and honest about what the vaccine is and the benefits of it. Explain it in terms that matter to them \u2014 for example, that it keeps them healthy so they can go to school and play with their friends. Welcome any questions they might have, too, and answer them in a simple, age-appropriate way. For our family, after getting vaccinated we often celebrated with ice cream \u2014 for the parents and the child! How can parents find a vaccine appointment for their young child if they don't have a pediatrician? They can check with their local Health Department. They can also use our [vaccine locator tool.](https://vaccinelocator.doh.wa.gov/) Remember, the vaccine is cost-free. And it's available to all who are eligible. Neither you nor your child need to be US citizens or have insurance to get any COVID-19 vaccines. One last question. For children who already had the vaccine, when can they get a booster? Boosters are necessary for both kids and adults, because they remind your immune system of what the virus looks like so if you do come across the virus, your immune system can quickly and strongly mount a protective response. The [updated bivalent COVID booster](https://doh.wa.gov/newsroom/updated-covid-19-booster-eligibility-expanded-people-ages-5-and-older) (which better protects against new omicron variants) is currently available to people who are 5 and older and should be received at least two months after the last dose. I haven't heard any announcements yet on when the bivalent booster will be available for children 4 and under, but I hope it's soon! I'll be discussing the updated boosters at a free webinar event on Oct. 20 at 5 p.m. You can submit any questions and register [here](https://cplusc.zoom.us/webinar/register/8416643912844/WN_20TKJyXgR36fvpqj0eV8AA).
