Please contact us for any additional questions or concerns regarding safety and vaccination. Our licensed acupuncturists and herbalists are experienced practitioners in both traditional Chinese medicine and pharmacy. Darquin is a licensed Acupuncturist with a Masters in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine from MCPHS University (formerly New England School of Acupuncture). He began his career with a Doctor of Pharmacy degree from Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and had a rediscovered interest in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) after witnessing a myriad of side effects from common medications. Darquin utilizes his knowledge of both backgrounds of medicine to treat effectively. With the pharmacy degree, he can identify and help manage adverse drug reactions that may contribute to the patient's condition. Darquin's background can also help identify key areas of focus as well as prescribing custom formulas that do not interact with current medications. With 5 years of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) training and 3 years of Orthopedic training in Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, one of the top TCM schools in China, Betty has followed hundreds of patients in three hospitals during her training. She also graduated from New England School of Acupuncture with a degree in Masters in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine and Japanese Style Acupuncture. She has a very good understanding of treating pain, infertility diseases and respiratory diseases by using acupuncture and traditional Chinese herbal medicine. Betty found the Japanese style of acupuncture very effective in treating pediatric diseases and anxiety. "}
