Specific points on the body are stimulated, usually by inserting thin needles into the skin and underlying tissues. Stimulating these specific points is believed to affect the flow of qi (a universal life force) along energy pathways (meridians) and thus restore balance. The procedure is generally not painful but may cause a tingling sensation. Sometimes stimulation is increased by twisting, warming, or otherwise manipulating the needle. Acupuncture points may also be stimulated by Pressure (called acupressure) Lasers (also called low-level laser therapy) A very low voltage electrical current (called electroacupuncture) applied to the needle (See also [Overview of Integrative, Complementary, and Alternative Medicine](/professional/special-subjects/integrative,-complementary,-and-alternative-medicine/overview-of-integrative,-complementary,-and-alternative-medicine) [ Overview of Integrative, Complementary, and Alternative Medicine Integrative medicine and health (IMH) and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) include healing approaches and therapies that historically have not been included in conventional, mainstream... read more ](/professional/special-subjects/integrative,-complementary,-and-alternative-medicine/overview-of-integrative,-complementary,-and-alternative-medicine) .) Evidence and Uses Acupuncture research is inherently difficult to conduct. Blinding is challenging and so-called \"sham\" acupuncture often puts pressure on acupressure points, thereby creating a different treatment experience that may not be truly inert. In regions where acupuncture is more part of the culture, particularly in China, published acupuncture studies are more abundant and broader in scope. Results showing efficacy should be interpreted in light of the fact that interventions include the full schema of traditional Chinese medicine of which acupuncture is only a component. The World Health Organization (WHO) has helped with this clinical challenge by issuing a [list of conditions](http://www.acupuncture.org.uk/public-content/public-traditional-acupuncture/4026-who-list-of-conditions.html) for which they have deemed evidence of efficacy to be strong or available but for which additional study is recommended, including Symptoms of cancer therapy Depression Dysmenorrhea Pain Headache Hypertension Post-operative symptoms Some complications of pregnancy Stroke complications Possible Adverse Effects and Contraindications Adverse effects of acupuncture are difficult to quantify and, although treatments are generally safe, skill and care vary among practitioners. A 2013 systematic review of the rare adverse effects (1.3 per 1000 treatments) after acupuncture included the following ( [1](/professional/special-subjects/integrative,-complementary,-and-alternative-medicine/acupuncture#v39504509) [ Reference Acupuncture, a therapy within traditional Chinese medicine, is one of the most widely accepted components of integrative therapies in the western world.
