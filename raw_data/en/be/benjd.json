The science, explained - Stat](https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/14/how-much-of-the-coronavirus-does-it-take-to-make-you-sick/) The minimum infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is unknown so far, but researchers suspect it is low. \"The virus is spread through very, very casual interpersonal contact. A high infectious dose may lead to a higher viral load, which can impact the severity of Covid-19 symptoms.

It is believed that ACEIs and ARBs inhibit and modulate the former and latter pathways, respectively.

[Molecular Investigation of SARS-CoV-2 Proteins and Their Interactions with Antiviral Drugs - Viruses](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/4/445) A new Coronavirus strain, named SARS-CoV-2, suddenly emerged in early December 2019. SARS-CoV-2 resulted in being dramatically infectious, with thousands of people infected. In this scenario, and without effective vaccines available, the importance of an immediate tool to support patients and against viral diffusion becomes evident. In this study, we exploit the molecular docking approach to analyze the affinity between different viral proteins and several inhibitors, originally developed for other viral infections.

In the absence of national leadership, states and counties are left to their own judgments, to procure their own essential supplies, and to set their own policies, making large-scale coordinated testing even more challenging. And the county-level public health institutions we defer to for policymaking do not control the financial or health care delivery resources required to implement the testing and contact tracing we need today and the vaccinations we will need tomorrow.
