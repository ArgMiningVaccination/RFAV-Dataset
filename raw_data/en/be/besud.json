Answer: Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine or BBIBP-CorV COVID-19 vaccine was approved by the Thai FDA under the name \"COVID-19 Vaccine (Vero Cell), Inactivated\". It is an inactivated virus vaccine produced by China National Pharmaceutical Group Corporation (CNPG), which is the subsidiary of Sinopharm Group Co., Ltd - a Chinese pharmaceutical company. Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine was approved by the Chinese FDA on 31 December 2020. Under emergency circumstances, Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine has been widely used in more than 40 countries around the world. Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine was approved by the World Health Organization (Emergency Use Listing Procedure or EUL) only for Beijing Institute of Biological Products or BBIBP-CorV from Beijing, China. Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine produced by Beijing Institute of Biological Products is also available in Thailand. Q: What are benefits obtained from Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccines? Answer: Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine is an inactivated virus vaccine using SARS-CoV-2 viruses whose genetic materials have been destroyed either by chemicals, radiation or heat. Once the capability of viral replication is debilitated, the viruses cannot multiply, but they can still trigger the immune system to build up antibodies to fight against COVID-19. Theoretically, technology used to produce an inactivated virus vaccine is considered safe since this traditional type of vaccine, e.g. some inactivated flu vaccines has been used for a long time. Q: How efficacious is Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine? Answer: A large multi-country Phase 3 trial has shown that 2 doses, administered at an interval of 21 days, have an efficacy of 79% against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection 14 or more days after the second dose. Vaccine efficacy against hospitalization was 79%. Nevertheless, the trial was not designed and powered to demonstrate efficacy against severe disease in persons with comorbidities, in pregnancy, or in people aged 60 years and above. Women were underrepresented in the trial. The median duration of follow-up available at the time of evidence review was 112 days. In addition, the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines might widely vary against different variants. (Information is as of 14 May 2021.) Q: What is the recommended dosage regimen? Answer: Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine is recommended for people aged 18 and above. The vaccine is given as 2 doses (0.5 ml) intramuscularly. WHO recommends an interval of 3-4 weeks between the first and second dose. If the second dose is administered less than 3 weeks after the first, the dose does not need to be repeated. If administration of the second dose is delayed beyond 4 weeks, it should be given at the earliest possible opportunity. It is recommended that all vaccinated individuals receive two doses. Q: What are contraindications to Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine? Answer: Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine is not recommended for: - Anyone who developed serious allergic reactions from previous vaccination with Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine. - Anyone who is allergic to any vaccine components. - People aged below 18. - Pregnant women. Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine might be considered only if vaccine benefits outweigh the potential risks. - People who have fever or body temperature is greater than 38.5 'C. Q: What are possible side effects caused by Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine? Answer: Common side effected caused by Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine are: - Pain, swelling, redness at the injection site. Cold compress can be applied to alleviate pain. - Weakness or fatigue - Headache - Muscle pain or malaise - Fever or chills - Nausea These side effects usually happen within a day or two of getting the vaccine. They are normal signs that your body is building up protection. These symptoms should subside and go away within a few days. In case that headache or fever exhibits, paracetamol can be taken as directed if no allergy history. Nonetheless, if symptoms worsen or severe allergic reactions develop, e.g. skin rash, urticarial, breathing difficulty, abdominal pain and diarrhea, immediate medical assistance must be sought. Q: Can people infected with COVID-19 be vaccinated with Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine? Answer: For COVID-19 patients who have been treated with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma therapy in the hospital, Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine administration can be considered at least 90 days after receiving COVID-19 treatment. For COVID-19 patients who did not receive monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma therapy, Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine can be administered once SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCT test shows negative result (not detected) for at least 1 month. In this case, only single dose of Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine is required. Q: Can Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine be used interchangeably with other COVID-19 vaccines? Answer: Due to a lack of firm clinical evidence in efficacy and safety, COVID-19 vaccines should not be used interchangeably. The first dose and second dose should be the same vaccine. However, if severe allergic reactions develop after the first dose, other alternative vaccines might be considered. Once administrative guideline for vaccine interchangeability becomes conclusive, the recommendations might be changed in accordance with standard guideline. Q: Can Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine be used as a booster dose after 2 doses of Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine were fully given? Answer: Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines are both inactivated virus vaccine protecting against COVID-19. There is no current evidence to demonstrate additional benefit of Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine as a booster dose after 2 doses of Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine were fully administered. Please note that all COVID-19 vaccines are newly developed under the emergency circumstances. Long-term studies indicating their efficacy and safety are relatively limited, therefore it remains important to stay updated on clinical recommendations and guidelines. Share "}
