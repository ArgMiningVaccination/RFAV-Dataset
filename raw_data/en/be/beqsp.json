[What is Ayurved?](https://drvaidyas.com/what-is-Ayurved/) Ayurved literally means 'the science of life' and is a form of medicine that looks at a holistic approach to healing rather than just medicine. In simple language, Ayurved is the natural practise that is basically based on the study of the three [doshas - Vata, Pitta and Kapha](https://drvaidyas.com/dosha-test/). These doshas determine an individual's Ayurvedic personality and are determined by the combination of the 5 elements in the human body. It aims to keep the structural and functional entities in the body fit. A misbalance in the state of equilibrium of these doshas makes a person prone to disease as well. Various techniques, rules, diet and herbal constituents help the body maintain a balance of doshas and thus remain fit. What is Unani? Originated in Greece, Unani is a branch of natural medicine that focuses on learning about the potential methods by which a person can lead a completely healthy life without falling ill. It is a structure of medicine which promotes positive health and prevention of diseases. It is a healing system that uses special treatments on its patients. It is based on the model of four humors in the body i.e. black bile, yellow bile, blood and phlegm. How are Unani and Ayurveda different? Both the practices are based on natural concepts and hence look similar to each other but interestingly they are also significantly different. The only similarity between the two is that these methods are natural and thus, largely side effect free. Other than this, there are quite a few differences. Thus, let's take a look at these differences between Unani and Ayurved: 1) Origin: While Ayurved is a 3000+-year-old concept originated in India. On the other hand, the roots of Unani are the Middle East and East Asia. It is known to have originated in Greece and then travelled Eastwards. Both the systems have now gained popularity world over. 2) Focus area: Ayurveda focuses on the imbalances of the dosha - Vata, Pitta and Kapha and curates medicine that helps balance these doshas. Unani uses eight diagnosis methods for effective results which include pulse, stool, urine, tongue, speech, vision, touch and appearance. 3) Prevention of disease: Ayurveda aims at strengthening the capacity of the body and [improving immunity](/products/chyawan-tabs-ayurvedic-immunity-booster) by using herbs and minerals in its medicines. Meditation, therapeutic massages, distinctive diets and cleansing techniques are also a part of this method. As for Unani, it uses medicines, dietary changes, drinks, and other practices such as codes of conduct to promote good health. It believes that clean air, water and fresh food can help a person stay away from many diseases. The medicines are normally made from plant products and are supplemented by methods like Turkish bath, exercise, leeching etc. [Learn about the top 10 foods and diets for better immunity](/blogs/all/natural-foods-and-diets-for-health-and-immunity/). 4) Treatment: An Unani doctor will diagnose a disease by finding the reason behind the failure of the body due to which the disease has occurred. After this, a doctor may suggest changes in diet, rest and some Unani medicines. As for Ayurved, a doctor may ask a patient about their problems and then prescribe them medicines accordingly. Ayurveda focuses on metabolism, good digestion and proper excretion for effective treatment.
