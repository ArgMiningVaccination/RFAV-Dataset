I work in collaboration with ](https://www.seasalthomeopathy.com.au/louise-stewart-2/) [therapeutic eurythmists](https://www.seasalthomeopathy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/TherapeuticEurythmy.pdf), etheric massage practitioners, [community health social workers who provide mentoring in applying therapeutic care into everyday life,](https://www.instagram.com/lynclifton_mantlesofcare/) [practical parent educators](https://www.instagram.com/practical_wholistic_parenting/), art therapists and school teachers. My work in natural therapies started when I was 21 years old upon receiving a Diploma of Remedial Massage from Nature Care College in Sydney. Over the following 10 years I gained a wealth of massage experience from my own clinic as well as in an osteopathic clinic, aged care facilities and a disability support service where I had a contract to massage staff and clients in a day respite house. In 2004 I took up studies with [EduCareDo in the Foundations of Anthroposophy](https://www.educaredo.org) and its therapeutic applications under the guidance of [Lisa Romero](https://www.innerworkpath.com/about/). My practice extended to include topical medicaments in the form of compresses, footbaths and oils. My interest in prescribing grew as I came to understand the depth anthroposophy could bring to wholistic healthcare. In 2013 I graduated from Endeavour College of Natural Medicine with an Advanced Diploma in Homeopathy to which I apply the fundamentals of therapy outlined in anthroposophy and prescribe [anthroposophic remedies ](https://www.seasalthomeopathy.com.au/about-the-medicines/)from my private practice.

This therapy is becoming an important area of my clinical work. As well as my clinical practice, I work alongside teachers and parents in schools, contributing to child studies and parent /teacher education in the areas of child development and home-healthcare, and also makes home visits to work with individual families.
