This guide is not a substitute for reading the law and its regulations. State board and commission members who have further questions should contact their board chair or staff. The Ethics Act applies to all current and former executive branch public employees and members of statutorily created boards and commissions . Scope of Ethics Act (AS 39.52.110) Service on a state board or commission is a public trust. The Ethics Act prohibits substantial and material conflicts of interest. Further, board or commission members, and their immediate family, may not improperly benefit, financially or personally, from their actions as board or commission members. The Act does not, however, discourage independent pursuits, and it recognizes that minor and inconsequential conflicts of interest are unavoidable. Misuse of Official Position (AS 39.52.120) Members of boards or commissions may not use their positions for personal gain or to give an unwarranted benefit or treatment to any person. For example, board members may not: x use their official positions to secure employment or contracts; x accept compensation from anyone other than the State for performing official duties; x use State time, equipment, property or faci lities for their own personal or financial benefit or for partisan political purposes; x take or withhold official action on a matt er in which they have a personal or financial interest; or x coerce subordinates for their personal or financial benefit. x attempt to influence outcome of an administ rative hearing by privately contacting the hearing officer. Terry knew that a proposal that was before the board would harm Terry's business competitor. Instead of publicly disclosing the matter and requesting recusal, Terry voted on the proposal. Board member Mick has board staff employee Bob type an article for him that Mick hopes to sell to an Alaskan magazine. Bob types the article on State time. 12Improper Gifts (AS 39.52.130) A board member may not solicit or accept gifts if a person could reasonably infer from the circumstances that the gift is intended to influence the board member's action or judgment. \"Gifts\" include money, items of value, services, loans, trav el, entertainment, hospitality, and employment. All gifts from registered lobbyists are presumed to be improper, unless the giver is immediate family of the person receiving the gift. A gift worth more than $150 to a board member or the board member's immediate family must be reported within 30 days if: x the board member can take official action that can affect the giver, or x the gift is given to the board member because he or she is on a state board. The receipt of a gift worth less than $150 may be prohibited if a person could reasonably infer from the circumstances that the gift is intended to influence the board member's action or judgment. Receipt of such a gift should be disclosed. Any gift received from another government, regardless of value, must be reported; the board member will be advised as to the disposition of this gift. A form for reporting gifts is available at www.law.alaska.gov/doclibrary/ethics or from the board or commission staff. This restriction on gifts does not apply to lawful campaign contributions. The commission is reviewing Roy's proposal for an expansion of his business. Roy invites all the board members out to dinner at an expensive restaurant. He says it will be okay, since he isn't excluding any of the members. Jody receives a holiday gift every year from Sam. Jody was recently appointed to a state board, but Sam has no business that is before the board. Jody may accept the gift. Improper Use or Disclosure of Information (AS 39.52.140) No former or current member of a board may use or disclose any information acquired from participation on the board if that use or disclosure could result in a financial or personal benefit to the board member (or immediate family), unless that information has already been disseminated to the public. Board members are also prohibited from disclosing confidential information, unless authorized to do so. 13Sheila has been on the board for several years. She feels she has learned a great deal of general information about how to have a successful business venture. So she sets up her own business and does well. Delores has always advised and assisted the other doctors in her clinic on their continuing education requirements. After Delores is appointed to the medical board, she discloses this role to the board and continues to advise the doctors in her clinic. Jim reviews a confidential investigation report in a licensing matter. He discusses the practitioner's violation with a colleague who is not a board member. Improper Influence in State Grants, Contracts, Leases or Loans (AS 39.52.150) A board member, or immediate family, may not apply for, or have an interest in a State grant, contract, lease, or loan, if the board awards or takes action to administer the State grant, contract, lease, or loan. A board member (or immediate family) may apply for or be a party to a competitively solicited State grant, contract or lease, if the board as a body does not award or administer the grant, contract, or lease and so long as the board member does not take official action regarding the grant, contract, or lease. A board member (or immediate family) may apply for and receive a State loan that is generally available to the public and has fixed eligibility standards, so long as the board member does not take (or withhold) official action affecting the loan's award or administration. Board members must report to the board chair any personal or financial interest (or that of immediate family) in a State grant, contract, lease or loan that is awarded or administered by the agency the board member serves. A form for this purpose is available at www.law.alaska.gov/doclibrary/ethics or from the board or commission staff. John sits on a board that awards state grants. John hasn't seen his daughter for nearly ten years so he figures that it doesn't matter when her grant application comes up before the board. The board wants to contract out for an analysis of the board's decisions over the last ten years. Board member Kim would like the contract since she has been on the board for ten years and feels she could do a good job. 14Improper Representation (AS 39.52.160) A board or commission member may not represent, advise, or assist a person in matters pending before the board or commission for compensation A nonsalaried board or commission member may represent, advise, or assist in matters in which the member has an interest that is regulated by the member's own board or commission, if the member acts in accordance with AS 39.52.220 by disclosing the involvement in writing and on the public record, and refraining from all participation and voting on the matter. This section does not allow a board member to engage in any conduct that would violate a different section of the Ethics Act. Susan sits on the licensing board for her own profession. She will represent herself and her business partner in a licensing matter. She discloses this situation to the board and refrains from participation in the board's discussions and determinations regarding the matter. Restriction on Employment After Leaving State Service (AS 39.52.180) For two years after leaving a board, a former board member may not provide advice or work for compensation on any matter in which the former member personally and substantially participated while serving on the board. This prohibition applies to cases, proceedings, applications, contracts, legislative bills, regulations, and similar matters. This section does not prohibit a State agency from contracting directly with a former board member. With the approval of the Attorney General, the board chair may waive the above prohibition if a determination is made that the public interest is not jeopardized. Former members of the governing boards of public corporations and former members of boards and commissions that have regulation-adoption authority, except those covered by the centralized licensing provisions of AS 08.01, may not lobby for pay for one year. The board has arranged for an extensive study of the effects of the Department's programs. Andy, a board member, did most of the liaison work with the contractor selected by the board, including some negotiations about the scope of the study. Andy quits the board and goes to work for the contractor, working on the study of the effects of the Department's programs. Andy takes the job, but specifies that he will have to work on another project. Aiding a Violation Prohibited (AS 39.52.190) Aiding another public officer to violate the Ethics Act is prohibited. 15Agency Policies (AS 39.52.920) Subject to the Attorney General's review, a board may adopt additional written policies further limiting personal or financial interests of board members. Disclosure Procedures DECLARATION OF POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS BY MEMBERS OF BOARDS OR COMMISSIONS (AS 39.52.220) A board member whose interests or activities could result in a violation of the Ethics Act if the member participates in board action must disclose the matter on the public record and in writing to the board chair who determines whether a violation exists. A form for this purpose is available at www.law.alaska.gov/doclibrary/ethics or from the board or commission staff . If another board member objects to the chair's ruling or if the chair discloses a potential conflict, the board members at the meeting (excluding the involved member) vote on the matter. If the chair or the board determines a violation will occur, the member must refrain from deliberating, voting, or participating in the matter. For more information, see Ethics Act Procedures for Boards and Commissions available at the above noted web site. When determining whether a board member's involvement in a matter may violate the Ethics Act, either the chair or the board or commission itself may request guidance from the Attorney General. ATTORNEY GENERAL'S ADVICE (AS 39.52.240-250) A board chair or a board itself may request a written advisory opinion from the Attorney General interpreting the Ethics Act. A former board member may also request a written advice from the Attorney General. These opinions are confidential. Versions of opinions without identifying information may be made available to the public. REPORTS BY THIRD PARTIES (AS 39.52.230) A third party may report a suspected violation of the Ethics Act by a board member in writing and under oath to the chair of a board or commission. The chair will give a copy to the board member and to the Attorney General and review the report to determine whether a violation may or does exist. If the chair determines a violation exists, the board member will be asked to refrain from deliberating, voting, or participating in the matter. Complaints, Hearings, and Enforcement COMPLAINTS (AS 39.52.310-330) Any person may file a complaint with the Attorney General about the conduct of a current or former board member. Complaints must be written and signed under oath. The Attorney General may also initiate complaints based on information provided by a board. A copy of the complaint will be sent to the board member who is the subject of the complaint and to the Personnel Board. All complaints are reviewed by the Attorney General. If the Attorney General determines that the complaint does not warrant investigation, the complainant and the board member will be notified of 16the dismissal. The Attorney General may refer a complaint to the board member's chair for resolution. After investigation, the Attorney General may dismiss a complaint for lack of probable cause to believe a violation occurred or recommend corrective action. The complainant and board member will be promptly notified of this decision. Alternatively, if probable cause exists, the Attorney General may initiate a formal proceeding by serving the board or commission member with an accusation alleging a violation of the Ethics Act. Complaints or accusations may also be resolved by settlement with the subject. CONFIDENTIALITY (AS 39.52.340) Complaints and investigations prior to formal proceedings are confidential. If the Attorney General finds evidence of probable criminal activity, the appropriate law enforcement agency shall be notified. HEARINGS (AS 39.52.350-360) An accusation by the Attorney General of an alleged violation may result in a hearing. An administrative law judge from the state's Office of Administrative Hearings serves as hearing officer and determines the time, place and other matters. The parties to the proceeding are the Attorney General, acting as prosecutor, and the accused public officer, who may be represented by an attorney. Within 30 days after the hearing, the hearing officer files a report with the Personnel Board and provides a copy to the parties. PERSONNEL BOARD ACTION (AS 39.52.370) The Personnel Board reviews the hearing officer's report and is responsible for determining whether a violation occurred and for imposing penalties. An appeal may be filed by the board member in the Superior Court. PENALTIES (AS 39.52.410-460) When the Personnel Board determines a board member has violated the Ethics Act, it will order the member to refrain from voting, deliberating, or participating in the matter. The Personnel Board may also order restitution and may recommend that the board member be removed from the board or commission. If a recommendation of removal is made, the appointing authority will immediately remove the member. If the Personnel Board finds that a former board member violated the Ethics Act, it will issue a public statement about the case and will ask the Attorney General to pursue appropriate additional legal remedies. State grants, contracts, and leases awarded in violation of the Ethics Act are voidable. Loans given in violation of the Ethics Act may be made immediately payable.

The AKPhA recently held an election; Renee Robinson is now 147 president. On committee updates and accomplishme nts, the association offered a hybrid virtual 148 convention which offered live-stream access to presentations for 16 hours of continuing 149 education. The association also held a Pharmacy Leadership Development program. 150 151 The association expanded academic and student outreach by holding immunization clinics at 152 UAA, Carrs Safeway, Three bears, as well as with the Alaska Black Caucus. They recently 153 established a partnership with DHSS and will be holding a joint virtual health fair. On legislative 154 updates, the association support s HB145 and HB306 and opposes HB237. 155 156 NABP Interactive Forum (Ashley Schaber) 157 Dr. Schaber summarized highlights from her participation in the NABP Interactive Form. She 158 stated that states discussed em ergency rules, the federal PREP Act, vaccinators, and waivers. 159 There were discussions from other states about a dding the ability for technicians to administer flu 160 vaccines and efforts to change the definition of when emergency supplies of medications can be 161 dispensed. States also looked to increase a 30-day supply to 90-day supply without a new 162 prescription. Some state boards of pharmacies work ed with hospitals for labeling inhalers and 163 other bulk items to ensure patients could take them home. Some states extended trainee licensees. 164 Dr. Schaber added there were discussions on how states don't always look at pharmacists as 165 practitioners. Some states focused on man-power barriers and removing barriers to get technicians 166 into the workforce, including looking at using the national guard without requiring a technician 167 license. 168 235 Alaska Board of PharmacyFebruary 17-18, 2022 Meeting169 Dr. Schaber stated other topics discussed incl uded workplace conditions and well-being. North 170 Dakota lead this topic and requires national certification of their technicians; what they're seeing is 171 that they're being retained longer and have less of a technician shortage like is being seen in other 172 states. Dr. Schaber stated this is timely because it is currently being discussed in Alaska. Another 173 discussion was mandatory breaks; the inspector would ask team members about whether they are 174 given regular breaks. Some states are required to provide for breaks, but there is also a 175 responsibility for pharmacists to schedule breaks wh ere staff must take a break. Several states have 176 partnerships in place with schools of pharmacies, board members, associations, chain drug stores, 177 etc. to improve workplace wellness. Dr. Schaber also shared other states were also looking at 178 prescriptive authority and the issues of white and brown bagging. White bagging requires 179 medications to be filled at a specialty pharmacy whereas brown bagging involves insurance 180 companies requiring medications to be shipped directly to the patient and then brought to the 181 hospital or clinic for administration. 182 183 On the PDMP, Dr. Schaber stated North Dakota received a grant and implemented a screening 184 tool for risk of OD at the point of dispensing to then dispense naloxone. The program is called 185 OneRx. Another state passed opioid registration fee for distributors based on the number of pills 186 they dispense in the state, but what they receive d was substantially lower than what had been 187 projected. 188 189 Dr. Schaber informed the board that the NABP has taken significant steps to address NAPLEX 190 issues as many states received score reports that were blank. Dr. Schaber also discussed the Drug 191 Supply Chain and Security Act (DSCSA) and diversion schemes occurring where drugs are 192 purchased under a pharmacy license but sold by a wholesaler and transferred within the company. 193 194 Dr. Schaber stated the NABP's 118thAnnual Meeting would be held between May 19-21. Ms. Bell 195 stated that as first year board member, she could not stress enough how much it benefited her in 196 so many ways. Ms. Bell encouraged board memb ers to participate in NABP-sponsored training 197 whenever possible. 198 199 Well-Being Index Report (Laura Carrillo) 200 Ms. Carrillo stated the pharmacy workplace and well-being report is an anonymous questionnaire 201 developed by the Mayo clinic and is analyzed by the Alliance for Patient Medication Safety. The 202 goal was to collect experience on work-place con ditions and how it affects personnel satisfaction 203 as well as patient safety. There were 431 negati ve experiences and only 9 positive experiences 204 among all district 7 states. 205 206 Some highlights as a result of experiencing high distress in the workplace include: 207 x3-fold higher risk of low quality of life 208 x8-fold higher risk of burnout 209 x2.5 risk of high fatigue and intent to leave their employer 210 xa 2-fold higher risk of medication error. 211 246 Alaska Board of PharmacyFebruary 17-18, 2022 Meeting212 Dr. Ruffridge stated this presentation is reflective of a trend experienced by Alaska pharmacists 213 for some time now. Dr. Ruffridge highlighted the data on distress percent by practice setting; 214 showing that pharmacists working in community-chain pharmacy settings demonstrate the 215 highlights stress response nationally, compared to the academic setting, which is lowest (46.61% in 216 January 2022 versus 21.38%.). Dr. Ruffridge stated a lot of the stress also falls to technicians, so 217 looks forward to further discussion on how we can improve conditions for them. There were 218 some measures where Alaska data couldn't be reported due to a small sample size. Dr. Schaber 219 stated there needed be at least 100 pa rticipants to see aggregate data. 220 221 Dr. Ruffridge suggested the survey be sent out through the ListServ. 222223 TASK 2 224 Ms. Carrillo will send the well-being index survey on pharmacy workplace conditions out through 225 the ListServ. 226227 Dr. Ruffridge called for break at 9:56 a.m. 228229 Off record at 9:56 a.m. 230 Back on record at 10:02 a.m. 231 232 Agenda Item 6 Investigative Report Time: 10:02 a.m. 233 234 Investigator Bowles joined the board to present its investigative report, which included matters 235 from November 17, 2021 through February 7, 2022.

Dr. Ruffridge noted that the notificati on for #113890 was only an initial notification 513 of a loss from October 15, 2021 and that the notice indicated an update would be provided every 514 45 days. Dr. Ruffridge inquired whether we received the DEA 106, to which Ms. Carrillo stated 515 she would follow-up. 516 517 TASK 7 518 Ms. Carrillo will follow-up with CVS pharmacy #113890 on the status of the initial loss of 519 prescriptions from October 15, 2021 and will update the board at its next meeting. 520 521 Correspondence 522 Anonymous: An Alaska licensee wrote to the NABP about concerns with staffing and public safety 523 in chain retail pharmacies. The letter is a call to action to the board of pharmacy to address 524 medication dispensing errors and job satisfaction. Dr. Schaber suggests setting up a work group or 525 subcommittee to work through these solutions; partnership with AKPhA, and employers with the 526 state. 527 528 TASK 8 529 Ms. Carrillo will reach out to Department of La bor, the AKPhA, and UAA, and will continue to 530 keep this on the agenda as a potential for a new work group. 531 532 Keith Koscielski - Mr. Koscielski wrote to the board requesting authorization to place a 533 CubexRxNow machine\u2014which functions as an electronic eKit and first-dose kit\u2014into skilled 534 nursing facility (a long-term care facility \"LTCF\" ), Prestige Care & Rehabilitation Center, which 535 holds an out-of-state registration by the board. Dr. Ruffridge inquired why the authorization 536 request is being made since the board doesn't regulate kiosks. Ms. Bell suggested the issue may be 537 around stocking the machine. Mr. Koscielski clar ified the regulations, 12 AAC 52.830 and 3214 Alaska Board of PharmacyFebruary 17-18, 2022 Meeting52.840, do speak to emergency drug kits but don't speak to whether it can be electronic. To Ms. 539 Bell's comment, Mr. Koscielski stated it is onl y dispensed when there's a valid prescription by a 540 prescriber, that controlled drugs are restricted by access code. Mr. Koscielski further stated the 541 request is whether the machine can be restocked with cubies instead of pharmacists physically 542 restocking it as required by regulation. The process is that the pharmacist only prepares for restock 543 but it is ultimately stocked by nursing staff. Ms . Bell inquired whether the facility is a DEA 544 registrant, to which Mr. Koscielski stated it is not, but that the machine is registered under the 545 prescriber's DEA. Ms. Bell expressed her unde rstanding that a LTCF cannot stock controlled 546 substances unless the facility is a DEA registrant and employs a medical director. 547 548 Ms. Bell suggested the board request a legal opinion from the Department of Law, to which Ms. 549 Lindemuth agreed. Dr. Ruffridge also supported a legal opinion but indicated he would like to 550 solidify his understanding with applicable laws. Mr. Koscielski referenced DEA regulations related 551 to emergency kits in LTCFs. Dr. Ruffridge read aloud the pertinent section of the manual: 552553554555556557558 559 560561562 563 564565566 567 Dr. Ruffridge noted the DEA does allow emergency kits if the state agency has the specific 568 regulatory authority, but that the board doesn't currently have regulations codifying standards for 569 placement of kits containing controlled substan ces. Mr. Koscielski recommended looking at other 570 state regulations, such as Washington. 571 572 TASK 9 573 Ms. Bell and Ms. Carrillo will work on draft regulations for emergency drug kits, both electronic 574 and physical for potential amendments to 12 AAC 52.830 and 12 AAC 52.840. 575576 Rich Holt - Dr. Holt shared that some states, includin g Colorado, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, and 577 others, delegate the determination of eligibility to the NABP. Ms. Carrillo shared that the NABP 578 confirms eligibility by reviewing their qualifications, like transcripts, and ult imately grants eligibility 579 to the applicant. Neal Watson with the NABP was on the line to provide details on this process, 580 adding it does provide efficiency for states. Dr. Schaber inquired how often the Alaska specific 581 3315 Alaska Board of PharmacyFebruary 17-18, 2022 Meetingquestions get updated, to which Mr. Watson stated is done annually with the MPJE item 582 development and testing workshops for state admin istrators and board members to participate in. 583 584 Dr. Ruffridge inquired whether the NABP does background checks. Mr. Watson stated the NABP 585 does not currently but that they do receive action s via ClearingHouse and allows state agencies to 586 access this. 587 588 The board continued discussing the option of delegating MPJE-eligibility to the NABP instead of 589 it being done by licensing staff. Dr. Ruffridg e requested adding 12 AAC 52.092 (Approval to Sit 590 for Examination) to the day 2 agenda during the regulations discussion. 591 592 TASK 10 593 Ms. Carrillo will add 12 AAC 52.092 as a new regula tion project for the board to further discuss 594 during day 2 of the February meeting. 595 596 Telepharm - the board reviewed correspondence from TelePharm, which proposed revising 12 597 AAC 52.423 to remove the 10 road mile restricti on. Dr. Ruffridge stated that he owns the only 598 remote pharmacy in Alaska and is a customer of TelePharm so would recuse himself from the 599 discussion. Mr. Henderson recalled that Dr. Holm's previous concern was that if there was already 600 a remote pharmacy present and a new pharmacy came in, it would force the remote pharmacy out 601 of business. Jessica Adams from TelePharm was on the line for discussion and historical context. 602 Ms. Adams stated that COVID-19 highlighted the disparities in marginal populations where access 603 to pharmacy services is a challenge, adding that telepharmacy services would alleviate this issue 604 and help balance the workload of full pharmacies. Ms. Adams stated the 10-mile limitation 605 prevents pharmacies from pursuing telepharmacy services as an option, adding that 10 miles may 606 not seem very long, but with rurality of Alaska and limited transportation, and harsh road 607 conditions, mobility limitations, it can become a difficult trek. Ms. Carrillo inquired how the 10- 608 mile was determined, to which Mr. Henderson stated it seemed reasonable but that it may have 609 been established arbitrarily. 610 611 Lorri Walmsley, Arizona board member and Walgreens pharmacist, shared the state does have 612 remote pharmacy regulations but does not impose a mileage restriction, adding there hasn't been 613 many issues. Jennifer Adams from Idaho State University shared that historically, Idaho had a 50- 614 mile limit, which similarly was arbitrarily determined by the board. It was later reviewed by the 615 board who ultimately removed the limit. Dr. Adams stated hasn't been a huge increase in the 616 number of telepharmacies since. Jessica Adams sh ared other states without mileage limitations, 617 such as Oregon, Washington, and Illinois. 618 619 On a motion duly made by Ashley Schabe r to add 12 AAC 52.423 regarding remote 620 pharmacy licensure to the February 18, day 2 agenda, seconded by Tammy Lindemuth 621 and approved by the majority with one abstention, it was: 622 623 RESOLVED to add 12 AAC 52.423 to the day 2 agenda. 624 3416 Alaska Board of PharmacyFebruary 17-18, 2022 ABSENT 626 627 Lana Bell x 628 Tammy Lindemuth x 629 James Henderson x 630 Ashley Schaber x 631 Leif Holm x 632 Sharon Long x 633 The motion passed without further discussion. 634 635 TASK 11 636 Ms. Carrillo will add 12 AAC 52.423 to the day 2 agenda under regulations. 637 638 FDA - The board reviewed correspondence from the FDA addressing the modified Risk 639 Evaluation and Mitigation (REMS) program for clo zapine, which has created barriers in patient 640 access to the drug. The FDA's letter states it does not intend to enforce certain REMS 641 requirements, including on pharmacies if they dispense clozapine without applying to REMS for a 642 Request to Dispense Authorization (RDA). Dr. Ru ffridge stated that access to clozapine is a major 643 issue and requested this correspondence be distributed through the ListServ. asks that we post this 644 through the ListServ. 645 646 TASK 12 647 Laura will send the FDA's Clozapine correspondence out via ListServ. 648 649 NABP - The board discussed the MPJE exam writing workshop from March 9-11, 2022. Ms. 650 Carrillo and Dr. Schaber volunteered to participate. 651 652 TASK 13 653 Laura Carrillo and Ashley Schaber will participate in the MPJE writing workshop on March 9-11th 654 virtually. 655656 The board reviewed additional correspondence, include age-related COVID-19 vaccine mix-ups 657 and reporting to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), as well as compounding 658 for the FDA's 2022 compounding quality center for excellence training opportunity. 659660 Dr. Ruffridge called for break at 3:10 p.m. 661 662 Off record at 3:10 p.m. 663 On record at 3:19 p.m. 664 665 Agenda Item 12 Board Business Time: 3:20 a.m. 666 3517 Alaska Board of PharmacyFebruary 17-18, 2022 Meeting667 PHA Disciplinary Matrix 668 Ms. Carrillo and Dr. Schaber presented the draft co mprehensive disciplinary matrix for the board's 669 review and approval. Mr. Henderson noted a possible typo with a fine amount for unlicensed 670 practice; Ms. Carrillo clarified it should be $25,000, not $2,500. Dr. Schaber commented on 671 formatting edits and suggested the PDMP violations be moved to the PDMP-specific matrix. Dr. 672 Ruffridge requested sending the matrix out via the ListServ. 673 On a motion duly made by Justin Ruffridge to approve the disciplinary matrix, seconded 674 by Tammy Lindemuth and approved unanimously, it was: 675 676 RESOLVED to approve the disc iplinary matrix as amended. 677 678 APPROVE DENY ABSTAIN ABSENT 679 Justin Ruffridge x 680 Lana Bell x 681 Tammy Lindemuth x 682 James Henderson x 683 Ashley Schaber x 684 Leif Holm x 685 Sharon Long x 686 The motion passed with further discussion. Mr. Henderson inquired whether advertising for 687 services is as egregious as shipping without a license. Dr. Ruffridge stated that advertising is costly 688 and is done with the intent to obtain and procure business, so should be treated similarly. Dr. 689 Ruffridge added that if after an investigative revi ew, the facility only advertised but did not ship 690 any products, the discipline could ultimately be determined by the reviewing board member. 691 692 TASK 14 693 Ms. Carrillo will make corrections to the matrix and will send it out through the ListServ. 694695 PDMP Disciplinary Matrix 696 Dr. Ruffridge stated this is a work in progress. Ms. Carrillo suggested esta blishing clear guidance, 697 e.g.: whether or not they missed a day of report ing and disciplining accordingly. Mr. Henderson 698 expressed interest in being more lenient especially for providers who miss 1 or reports 699 occasionally. 700 701 Media concerns 702 The board addressed an Alaska Watchman article where there was conflation between the board's 703 CE notice and its position on dispensing ivermectin . Dr. Ruffridge reiterated the that the board 704 has never taken a position against dispensing ivermectin; that its only position has been in 705 collaboration with the Nursing and Dental board s in addressing safe dispensing of it. 706 707 Agenda Item 13 Public Comment #2 Time: 4:21 708 3618 Alaska Board of PharmacyFebruary 17-18, 2022 Meeting709 Jennifer Adams : Dr. Adams thanked Dr. Ruffridge and Dr. Schaber for volunteering as evaluators 710 for the UAA/ISU pharmacy law evaluation class. 711 712 Agenda Item 14 Recess Time: 4:30 p.m. 713714 Dr. Ruffridge recessed the meeting until February 18, 2022. 715 State of Alaska 716 Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development 717 Division of Corporations, Business and Professional Licensing 718 719 Alaska Board of Pharmacy 720 721 DRAFT MINUTES OF THE MEETING 722 723 February 18, 2022 Videoconference 724 725 By authority of AS 08.01.070(2), and in co mpliance with the provisions of AS 44.62, 726 Article 6, a scheduled meeting of the Board of Pharmacy via videoconference on 727 February 18, 2022.

Dr. Ruffridge stated activity to 814 official run began in the beginning in 2022 and in no way affects his position on the board. 815 816 Agenda Item 4 Public Comment #3 Time: James Delker, DVM - Dr. Delker prefaced his comment with the statement that most of his 819 frustration is directed at issues that occurred prior to the current board makeup. Introducing 820 himself, Dr. Delker stated he has been a practicing veterinarian for 19 years and that he has been 821 involved with the PDMP since 2013. He stated he identified numerous problems with the PDMP, 822 and at the time, he presented at the Board of Pharmacy's November 21st, 2013 meeting about how 823 veterinarians can comply with the system. Dr. Delker stated he was told the board would table the 824 topic until the next meeting, but never received a response. Dr. Delker stated veterinarians have 825 been expressed as whiners who don't want to do their job, but that they have not been invited to 826 participate in discussions around the system. He further expressed concern around why data 827 disappears when it is being entered and added that veterinarian data shows miniscule risk of 828 diversion. Dr. Delker reiterated that the veterinarian's licensing fees are among the highest in the 829 country and spoke to Director Chamber's commen ts during the SB132 hearing about investigative 830 costs being paid for by grants, stating it is not the whole story. Concerns about why veterinarians 831 were not included on the Joint Committee on Prescriptive Guidelines establishing MME standards 832 were also expressed. Dr. Delker requested th at the board consider removing the onus of 833 veterinarians to comply with the requirements, adding veterinarians are happy to continue helping 834 3921 Alaska Board of PharmacyFebruary 17-18, 2022 Meetingcombat the opioid pandemic, but that they must have measurable data to show how they can 835 make a difference. 836837 Dr. Ruffridge inquired whether his testimony was written and if Dr. Delker could forward it to 838 Ms. Carrillo for distribution to the board. 839840841 TASK 15 842 Ms. Carrillo will forward Dr. Delker's testimony on veterinary exemption from the PDMP to the 843 board. 844 845 Callista Carlton - Dr. Carlton introduced herself as the pharmacy clinical director with South 846 Central Foundation, stating that curbside dispe nsing module arose as a solution during the 847 pandemic, adding it allows for medication-pick-up without having to come into the lobby. Dr. 848 Carlton stated they have since realized it's not su stainable, but that a pharmacy locker would be a 849 more sensible and permanent solution. Dr. Carlton inquired whether a presentation to the board 850 would be helpful, to which the board agreed. Dr. Carlton stated she would be prepared to also 851 share regulations from other states. 852 853 TASK 16 854 Laura Carrillo will place Callista Carlton on the board's next meeting agenda for a presentation on 855 pharmacy lockers. 856 857 Margaret Soden - Ms. Soden stated she has been a pharmacist in Alaska for 52 years and recently 858 retired from practice. Ms. Soden was on the board twice; first from 1983 to 1989 and then again 859 from 1998 to 2006 where she served as president from 2000-2004. Speaking to Dr. Delker's 860 comment, Ms. Soden stated she was not on the board when it discussed veterinary participation in 861 the PDMP but agreed with him. Ms. Soden stated she was on the call for historical reference per 862 Dr. Schaber's request to discuss remote pharmacy licensure. 863 864 Dr. Schaber asked where the 10-mile restriction came from come. Ms. Soden stated it was an 865 emerging topic in early 2000 and there was little knowledge about where remote pharmacies could 866 be placed. The context at the time was a pharmacy out of Fairbanks wanted to put in a remote 867 location in Healy or Delta Junction, but that a concern was that a remote pharmacy could end up 868 hiring full staff to where it is no longer providing remote services. Ms. Soden further recalled the 869 board discussing a 3-mile restriction as well as the 10-mile restriction, suggesting the latter may 870 have been a compromise. Ms. Lindemuth expressed thanks to Ms. Soden for her time, her years of 871 work on the board, and for the foundational insight she provided. 872873 Mr. Henderson inquired whether it would be appropriate for Ms. Soden to speak to Dr. Delker's 874 comments. Ms. Soden stated when that when she w as on the board in 2004, she and Bill Altland 875 met with a representative from a pharmaceutical company and they were presenting sample 876 regulations on the PDMP. Ms. Soden recalled the goal was to control the amount of controlled 877 4022 Alaska Board of PharmacyFebruary 17-18, 2022 Meetingsubstances that were being inappropriately prescribed by physicians, nurse practitioners, and 878 dentists, but that at the time there wasn't a consideration to include optometrists and veterinarians. 879 Ms. Soden added she didn't think of these professions as being a source of inappropriate 880 prescribing and that including veterinarians in the PDMP only by virtue they prescribe is a stretch. 881 Ms. Soden agreed it must be difficult to access information and report daily. 882883884 Agenda Item 5 Legal Opinion Updates Time: 9:34 a.m. 885886 White/brown bagging 887 Dr. Ruffridge stated there seems to be certain aspects the board can regulate with regards to white 888 and brown bagging but doesn't match up fully to what the boards want to have oversight on. Dr. 889 Schaber commented it seems to fall more under the purview of the Division of Insurance. 890 891 Pharmacy technicians with national certification 892 Dr. Ruffridge stated this will be discussed fu rther under statutes under Agenda Item #9. 893 894 Medication therapy management 895 LAW provided input on whether pharmacies registered outside of the state could engage in 896 providing medication therapy management without being registered by the board. Dr. Ruffridge 897 stated pharmacists employed in out-of-state pha rmacies would be providing this service. Mr. 898 Henderson stated there is no statute that allows the board to regulate out-of-state personnel, 899 which in part is due to the statute for regulating these pharmacies being weak; they are registered 900 rather than licensed by the board. Ms. Bell stated this is why she is worried about controlled 901 substances and out-of-state pharmacies installing machines. 902 903 Dr. Ruffridge pointed to AS 08.80.030(b) regarding li censure required for practicing in the state, 904 suggesting a need for a legal opinion on what \"in\" the state means. 905 906 907908 The board ultimately agreed the following question should be posed to LAW: 909910 Can the board through regulations define what it means to practice in the state as referenced in AS 911 08.80.030(b)(8), to include being physically located in the state as well as providing services to the 912 state? And if yes, can the board require pharmacis ts located outside of the state who are providing 913 services for a registered out-of-state pharmacy to be licensed in Alaska without a statute change? 914 915 On a motion duly made by Justin Ruffridg e to direct Ms. Carrillo to request a legal 916 opinion from the Department of Law on wh ether the board has authority to regulate 917 pharmacists providing services in the state but located outside of the state, seconded by 918 Tammy Lindemuth, and approved unanimously, it was: 919 920 4123 Alaska Board of PharmacyFebruary 17-18, 2022 MeetingRESOLVED to request a legal opinion on regulation of out-of-state pharmacy 921 personnel. 922 923 APPROVE DENY ABSTAIN ABSENT 924 Justin Ruffridge x 925 Lana Bell x 926 Tammy Lindemuth x 927 James Henderson x 928 Ashley Schaber x 929 Leif Holm x 930 Sharon Long x 931 The motion passed with no further discussion. 932933 TASK 17 934 Laura Carrillo will submit a Department of La w legal opinion request through Deputy Director 935 Hoskinson on whether the board can require licensure for out-of-state pharmacy personnel given 936 AS 08.80.030(b)(8). 937 938 Purchaser of wholesale drugs 939 Dr. Ruffridge suggests adding to 12 AAC 52.620(d) that professions listed in AS 08.80.400 are 940 excluded. 941 942 Monoclonal antibodies 943 Dr. Ruffridge stated the opinion excludes oral antivirals because the FDA prohibits that. 944 945 Dr. Ruffridge called for break at 10:10 a.m. 946947 Off record at 10:10 a.m. 948 On record at 10:16 a.m. 949 950 Agenda Item 6 Regulations Time: 10:17 a.m. 951 952 Regulations out for public comment 953954 Fee reductions 955 Dr. Ruffridge provided an overview of the fee reduct ion proposals. Ms. Carrillo clarified that this 956 is a division regulation so public comments need to be submitted in writing. Public comments are 957 accepted through March 4th. 958 959 Military, emergency permit, courtesy licens e, renewal, and executive administrator 960 Ms. Carrillo stated this is out for public comment until March 8th. 961 962 4224 Alaska Board of PharmacyFebruary 17-18, 2022 MeetingRemaining regulations project from 2021 (reviewed by LAW) 963 964 x12 AAC 52.020 - pharmacy license. Ms. Carrillo explained that LAW is striking \"checklist\" 965 because the way it is currently worded already describes items required for licensure. 966 x12 AAC 52.030 - change of pharmacy location or name . Ms. Carrillo stated this section is being 967 struck because it's proposed to be incorporat ed into a larger section addressing changes. 968 x12 AAC 52.040 - Change of pharmacy ownership. This is also being repealed because it is being 969 incorporated into a new section. 970 x12 AAC 52.070 - application for pharmacist license by exam. The proposed changes include 971 review and approval of applications to be completed by the board's executive administrator 972 instead of by the board and for the transcript be replaced with a copy of the original 973 diploma. Dr. Ruffridge expressed concern around it being more difficult to require a 974 certified diploma. Dr. Adams commented that it is significantly easier to get a transcript 975 sent than a certified copy of a diploma. Ms. Carrillo stated the reason why the transcript 976 requirement was being repealed initially was because the NABP requires a transcript to 977 schedule exams. Dr. Schaber, Ms. Lindemuth, and Mr. Henderson agreed to striking both 978 the diploma and transcript requirement since the NABP already requires the latter. Dr. 979 Ruffridge called for a motion to repeal 12 AAC 52.070(b)(4). 980 981 On a motion duly made by Justin Ruffridge to repeal 12 AAC 52.070(b)(4) pertaining to 982 transcript and diploma requirements, seco nded by Tammy Lindemuth, and approved 983 unanimously, it was: 984 985 RESOLVED to repeal 12 AAC 52.070(b)(4). 986987 APPROVE DENY ABSTAIN ABSENT 988 Justin Ruffridge x 989 Lana Bell x 990 Tammy Lindemuth x 991 James Henderson x 992 Ashley Schaber x 993 Leif Holm x 994 Sharon Long x 995 The motion passed with further discussion. Mr. Henderson inquired about the process for 996 granting eligibility to take the NABP exams and how an applicant would receive an authorization 997 to test (ATT). Dr. Ruffridge clarified that the elig ibility section is a separate regulation in 12 AAC 998 52.092. Ms. Carrillo stated the regulations section exam eligibility is \"approval to sit for 999 examination\" whereas ATT is what is issued by the NABP to the applicant after the state 1000 regulatory board has administratively granted the applicant eligibility for the exam. Per the board's 1001 earlier discussion on delegating eligibility approval to the NABP, Ms. Carrillo added that the board 1002 could amend this section and 12 AAC 52.092 so they 're put in place at the same time, as well as 1003 4325 Alaska Board of PharmacyFebruary 17-18, 2022 Meetingtake into consideration the time it might take to finalize a delegation agreement with the NABP so 1004 changes occur seamlessly. 10051006 Ms. Carrillo stated not all of 12 AAC 52.070(b)(4) ca n be repealed because the board still needs to 1007 address foreign graduates. 1008 1009 On a motion duly made by Justin Ruffridge to create a subsection 8 pertaining to foreign 1010 pharmacy graduates and the FPGEC, seconded by Ashley Schaber, and approved 1011 unanimously, it was: 1012 1013 RESOLVED to create a su bsection 8 pha rmacy graduates and the 1014 Bell Leif Holm x 1023 Sharon Long x 1024 The motion passed with further discussion. 1025 1026 The board then discussed affidavits of moral character. Dr. Ruffridge inquired whether this should 1027 still be a requirement since anyone could write a letter of recommendation for an applicant. Ms. 1028 Carrillo stated it is in statut e, AS 08.80.110. Dr. Ruffridge suggested repealing this but requiring a 1029 background check. Ms. Carrillo in quired if most employers require background checks, to which 1030 Dr. Schaber stated most but not all do. Ms. Carrillo then inquired whether the board would want 1031 to require state-level background checks or national background checks; the former could be done 1032 via a regulation change but the latter would require a statute change to add the Board of Pharmacy 1033 to AS 12.62.400. Dr. Schaber expressed interest in continuing to discuss this. 1034 1035 TASK 18 1036 Ms. Carrillo will add national background checks, AS 12.62.400, to the board's next meeting as a 1037 potential statute change. 1038 1039 Mr. Henderson inquired about 12 AAC 52.070(b)(6 ), the requirement to verify 1,500 hours of 1040 experience and whether it is sent to the NABP. Ms. Carrillo stated it is just reviewed by board staff 1041 then asked whether this is standard. Dr. Adams stated that 1,700 hours is required in Idaho but 1042 that all states require at least 1,500 hours. Mr. Henderson suggested striking this subsection 1043 altogether because every pharmacy school requires that graduates complete a minimum of 1,500 1044 hours. 1045 4426 Alaska Board of PharmacyFebruary 17-18, 2022 Meeting1046 On a motion duly made by James Henderson to repeal 12 AAC 52.070(b)(6) and replace 1047 this requirement with an attesta tion and signature, seconded by Justin Ruffridge, and 1048 approved unanimously, it was: 1049 1050 RESOLVED to amend 12 AAC 52.070(b)(6). ABSTAIN ABSENT 1052 Bell Leif Holm x 1058 Sharon Long x 1059 The motion passed with further discussion. 1060 1061 The board then reviewed 12 AAC 52.070(c) regar ding eligibility to take the MPJE. Mr. 1062 Henderson suggested striking this because it is redundant to 12 AAC 52.092, approval to 1063 sit for examination. On a motion duly made by James Henderson to repeal 12 AAC 1064 52.070(c), seconded by Justin Ruffridg e, and approved unanimously, it was: 1065 1066 RESOLVED to repeal 12 AAC ABSTAIN Bell 1073 Ashley Schaber x 1074 Leif Holm x 1075 Sharon Long x 1076 The motion passed with further discussion. 1077 1078 The board then discussed potential language for the aforementioned changes to 12 AAC 1079 52.070(b)(8) and 12 AAC 52.070(b)(6). 10801081 On a motion duly made by Tammy Lindemuth to create subsection, 12 AAC 52.070(b)(8), 1082 to read \"...verification that a foreign pharma cy graduate received the Foreign Pharmacy 1083 Graduate Examination Committee certificate, sent directly to the department by the 1084 National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, if applicable.\", seconded by Ashley Schaber, 1085 and approved of PharmacyFebruary ABSTAIN Bell Leif Holm x 1096 Sharon Long x 1097 The motion passed with no further discussion. 10981099 On a motion duly made by Tammy Lindemuth to amend subsection, 12 AAC 52.070(b)(6) 1100 to read, \"...a signed attestation that the ap plicant has completed the internship hours 1101 required to graduate from an accredited pharmacy curriculum.\", seconded by Ashley 1102 Schaber, and approved unanimously, it 1103 1104 RESOLVED to amend 12 AAC 52.070(b)(6).

Dr. Ruffridge stated the board 1117 is repealing and replacing 12 AAC 52.070(b)(6) regarding the 1,500 hours, which effectively 1118 makes 12 AAC 52.080(a) moot. 1119 1120 On a motion duly made by James Henderson to repeal 12 AAC 52.080, seconded by 1121 Tammy Lindemuth, and approved unanimously, it was: 11221123 RESOLVED to repeal 12 AAC 52.080. 11241125 APPROVE Leif Holm x 1132 Sharon Long x 1133 The motion passed with discussion from Dr. Ruffridge that the editor's note covers accreditation. 1134 1135 x12 AAC 52.092 - Approval to sit for examination. The board discussed repealing this 1136 section and re-adopting it to reflect delegation of NAPLEX and MPJE approval to the 1137 NABP instead of it being done by board of pharmacy staff. 1138 1139 On a motion duly made by Tammy Lindemuth to repeal and readopt 12 AAC 52.092 to 1140 read, \"An applicant for licensure by examinat ion who has submitted documents that meet 1141 the requirements set out in 12 AAC 52.070 will be referred to the National Association of 1142 Boards of Pharmacy by the board pursuant to a written delegation agreement to determine 1143 eligibility to sit for the North American Ph armacy Licensing Exam ination (NAPLEX) and 1144 the Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination (MPJE) required under 12 AAC 1145 52.090, seconded by Ashley Schaber, and approved unanimously, it was: 1146 1147 RESOLVED to repeal and readopt Bell Leif Holm x 1156 Sharon Long x 1157 The motion passed with no further discussion. 1158 1159 x12 AAC 52.095 - Application for Pharm acist License by Reciprocity . The board first addressed 1160 making amendments to subsection (c)(4) l ike changes made for transcript/diploma 1161 requirements in 12 AAC 52.070(b)(4). Mr. Henderson inquired whether this whole section 1162 should be repealed. Dr. Schaber agreed, stating that the graduation and license 1163 requirements are already included in (c)(6)(7 ). The board discussed other requirements to 1164 repeal. The board discussed the reciprocity language. Dr. Ruffridge noted the language 1165 seems to have been copied and pasted from the examination regulations and that some 1166 requirements seem odd, such as the language about states participating in the NABP. Dr. 1167 4729 Alaska Board of PharmacyFebruary 17-18, 2022 MeetingRuffridge stated every state has a board of pharmacy and Dr. Adams stated all state board 1168 boards are a member of the NABP. Mr. He nderson stated the license verification 1169 requirement makes existing 7 redundant. Dr. Ruffridge suggested to strike proposed (e) on 1170 license transfer applications. 1171 1172 On a motion duly made by Tammy Lindemuth to amend 12 AAC 52.095(c) to strike (c)(4), 1173 keep (c)(5), repeal (c)(6)-(8), and amend (c)(9) to become (c)(4) to read, \"shall submit an 1174 application for license transfer through the Na tional Association of Boards of Pharmacy. 1175 The license by which the applicant is se eking reciprocity from must be current, 1176 unencumbered, and in good standing.\" second ed by Ashley Schaber, and approved 1177 unanimously, it was 1178 1179 RESOLVED to amend 12 AAC 52.095(c). 11801181 ABSTAIN ABSENT 1182 Bell Leif Holm x 1188 Sharon Long x 1189 The motion passed with no further discussion. 11901191 On a motion duly made by Justin Ruffridge to add a new subsection to 12 AAC 52.095 to 1192 state, \"experience gained during rotation requi rements at an accredited institution will be 1193 accepted by the board to satisfy AS 08.80. 145(5).\" seconded by James Henderson, and 1194 approved unanimously, it was: 1195 1196 RESOLVED to add a new subsection to 12 AAC 52.095. 11971198 APPROVE DENY ABSTAIN ABSENT 1199 Justin Ruffridge Lana Bell x 1201 Tammy Lindemuth x Leif Holm x 1205 Sharon Long x 1206 The motion passed with no further discussion. 1207 1208 Alaska Board of PharmacyFebruary 17-18, 2022 Meetingx12 AAC 52.120 - Review of pharmacy intern license application. The board reviewed this 1209 section. Ms. Carrillo commented the authorizat ion for release of records requirement isn't 1210 standard for all boards. The board discussed repealing this section as well as the 1211 authorization for release of records requirements for pharmacists. Chair Ruffridge then 1212 addressed the proposal to make the intern license valid for 5 years instead of 2, stating it 1213 may be too long. 1214 1215 On a motion duly made by Justin Ruffridge to strike the release of records requirement in 1216 12 AAC 52.070(b)(3), 12 AAC 52.092(b)(3), 12 AAC 52.095(b)(3), and 12 AAC 52.120(b)(6), 1217 seconded by James Henderson, and approved unanimously, it was: 1218 1219 RESOLVED to strike the release of records requirement for pharmacists and 1220 interns. 1221 1222 APPROVE DENY ABSTAIN Bell Leif Holm x 1229 Sharon Long x 1230 The motion passed with no further discussion. 12311232 x12 AAC 52.130 - Registration of pharmacies located outside of the state.

The board returned to 1256 discussing intern regulations. Ms. Carrillo explained the document before the board was 1257 written when she and Dr. Schaber were working on the disciplinary matrix; Dr. Schaber 1258 had pulled up NABP model laws pertaining to intern licensure. Ms. Carrillo noted the 1259 board's current regulations addresses graduate s of foreign pharmacy programs but doesn't 1260 have the same language for non-foreign graduate s, stating it is unclea r whether the existing 1261 language allows recent graduates to apply for an intern license or only those who are 1262 presently enrolled. The language only states the applicant must be enrolled, but it could be 1263 interpreted as being in past and present tense. The board reviewed the suggested language. 1264 1265 On a motion duly made by Tammy Lindemuth to amend 12 AAC 52.120(b)(3)(A) to read, 1266 \"presently enrolled in a college of pharmacy accredited by the ACPE and is satisfactorily 1267 progressing toward meeting the requirements fo r licensure as a pharmacist; or\" seconded 1268 approved unanimously, was: 1269 1270 RESOLVED to amend 12 AAC 52.120(b)(3)(A). 1271 DENY ABSTAIN ABSENT 1273 Bell Leif Holm x 1279 Sharon Long x 1280 The motion passed with no further discussion. 12811282 On a motion duly made by Tammy Lindemuth to amend 12 AAC 52.120(b)(3)(B) to read, 1283 \"a graduate of an accredited professional degree program from a school or college of 1284 pharmacy within one year preceding the date of this application.\" seconded by Ashley 1285 Schaber, and approved unanimously, it 1287 RESOLVED amend 12 Leif Holm x 1296 Sharon Long x 1297 The motion passed with no further discussion; howev er, Ms. Carrillo x12 AAC - Notification of theft or significant loss. Dr. Schaber stated there's a 1301 requirement to send the form to the DEA within 1 day, but that there isn't a current 1302 timeframe requirement for when to send this to the board. Dr. Schaber shared that states 1303 have different requirements, like Arizona, which requires the form to be submitted within 1304 10 days. Mr. Henderson inquired whether ther e is a corresponding statute obligation for 1305 pharmacies to submit this. Dr. Schaber stat ed AS 08.80.157 requires pharmacies to report 1306 this. Lorri Walmsley from the Arizona Board of Pharmacy shared they are considering 1307 extending the 10-day requirement because it often does take longer to complete the 1308 investigation. Dr. Ruffridge believes there should not be a time limit since they are already 1309 required to submit it to the DEA. Dr. Ruffridge stated it has not been an issue for the 1310 board, so a time limit shouldn't be impoesd now. Ms. Walmsley added that the DEA is 1311 considering also extending their 1-day timeframe to 30 days. Ms. Carrillo inquired about 1312 loss/theft notifications for wholesalers as many are inquiring whether this is a requirement 1313 in Alaska. Dr. Ruffridge suggested adding this as a new regulation item. 1314 1315 TASK 19 1316 Laura Carrillo will add wholesalers to the board's ne xt meeting agenda for a potential change to 12 1317 AAC 52.540 regarding notification of theft or significant loss. 1318 1319 x12 AAC 52.900 - Display of license certificate. Ms. Carrillo shared that the division plans 1320 to no longer print license certificates on license paper, but that it can still be printed on 1321 regular paper either by the division or by the licensee via MYLICENSE. Ms. Lindemuth 1322 stated that as a member of the public, she a ppreciates being able to see these displayed at 1323 pharmacies because it ensures the licensee has gone through the proper process, and that it 1324 adds a level of trust in the provider. Dr. Schaber stated there may also be a requirement by 1325 CMS and/or Joint Commission to have it displayed. 1326 1327 On a motion duly made by Tammy Lindemuth to repeal and readopt 12 AAC 52.990 to 1328 state, \"A licensee shall conspicuously display, in the practice site , the licensee's current 1329 license certificate.\" seconded by ridge, and approved unanimously, it was: 1330 1331 RESOLVED to repeal and readopt Bell Leif Holm x 1340 Sharon Long x 1341 The motion passed with no further discussion; however, Chair Ruffridge requested Ms. Carrillo 1342 send a notice out via the ListServ that certificates will no longer be printed on special paper. 1343 1344 TASK 20 1345 Laura Carrillo will send a notice via the ListServ in forming subscribers that license certificates will 1346 not be printed on special paper, but that it may still be printed on regular paper either by the 1347 division or by the licensee via MYLICENSE. 1348 1349 TASK 21 1350 Laura Carrillo will notify the NABP of the board's intent to delegate exam eligibility to their 1351 organization. 13521353 TASK 22 1354 Laura Carrillo will update the board's regulation project document with the changes discussed at 1355 this meeting for the board to review/approve at a special teleconference in March. 1356 1357 Chair Ruffridge called for lunch at 1:15 p.m. 13581359 Off record for lunch at 1:15 p.m. 1360 On record at 1:43 p.m. 1361 1362 Agenda Item 8 .Pharmacy Progra m Presentation Time: 1:44 p.m. 1363 1364 Bill Cover and Justin Macy from the NABP joined the board to present on its .Pharmacy Internet 1365 program. Mr. Cover stated that the vast majority of online pharmacies are operating outside of 1366 pharmacy laws. Mr. Macey stated the .Pharmacy progra m used to validate sites and provide digital 1367 seals, but in today's technology world, seals are easily becoming counterfeited or used 1368 inappropriately. Mr. Macey stated what this program is doing now is look how we can provide 1369 reliable information to patients seeking prescriptions from verified sites. 1370 1371 Mr. Macy added that 42% of Americans used an online pharmacy in 2021, up 7% since 2020. Of 1372 these patients who used online pharmacies, 59% of the patients believed the pharmacy was either 1373 approved by the FDA or a board of pharmacy, but in reality, most were not. Mr. Macy stated there 1374 5234 Alaska Board of PharmacyFebruary 17-18, 2022 Meetingare 30,000 - 35,000 illegal online pharmacies operating at any one time and 20 new illegal online 1375 pharmacies launching every day. The NABP has ident ified over 33,000 website that sell in conflict 1376 with state and federal laws or pharmacy practice standards. Drugs sold by illegal online pharmacies 1377 often contain too much, too little, or no active ingredient, are manufactured in unsafe conditions, 1378 and/or contain unsafe materials. It was found that 95% of websites reviewed don't require a valid 1379 prescriptions and 83% of websites offer drugs not authorized by the FDA. 1380 1381 Mr. Macy then demonstrated to the board a fake online pharmacy site which uses a counterfeit 1382 FDA approval logo and with drugs being sold in dosages never seen in retail pharmacies. Mr. 1383 Macy also showed the board how criminals were able to hack into a medical detox program 1384 website, getting into their URL and adding new pages to sell drugs illegally. If one were ever to 1385 search for this detox program, they would never find the illegal page; however, if someone 1386 searched \"Xanax online\", they would be able find it. 13871388 Mr. Macy stated the .Pharmacy program is recognized by Google, Visa, Twitter, and other 1389 domains. The. NABP owns .Pharmacy, meaning nobody can have a .pharmacy TLD without 1390 going through approval and accreditation proces s. Before the board were examples of state 1391 regulations and legislation around Internet pharmacies. Dr. Ruffridge stated that Alaskans have lot 1392 of remote communities shifting customers to look online, especially during COVID-19, then 1393 asked Mr. Macy which state may have the best model laws. Mr. Macy stated the perfect model 1394 doesn't exist. States have to think about what works for their patients and demographics, for 1395 example, DC pharmacies must be a recognized VIPPS Program, which is a pre-requisite to the 1396 .Pharmacy program, but only if they are solely an Internet pharmacy. Mr. Macy added that this 1397 then begs the question about whether pharmacies that aren't solely based online have to comply. 1398 1399 Since regulation of out-of-state pharmacies has been an ongoing topic of discussion for the last 1400 several years, Dr. Ruffridge expressed continuing discussion on this, particularly as a statute 1401 change. 1402 1403 TASK 23 1404 Laura Carrillo will add Internet pharmacies and licensing of out-of-state pharmacies to the agenda 1405 at the board's next meeting. 1406 1407 Agenda Item 9 Statutes Time: 2:18 p.m. 14081409 White bagging/Brown bagging (Caren Robinson) 1410 Ms. Robinson shared that she had been working with Senator Olson on draft legislation related to 1411 patient choice and white bagging/brown bagging but was regretful in having to inform the board 1412 it may not be introduced this year. 14131414 Board statute interests 1415 Ms. Carrillo stated there was some momentum a few years ago to get a statute project going, but at 1416 present there isn't a comprehensive and updated draft. Dr. Ruffridge recommended the board 1417 5335 Alaska Board of PharmacyFebruary 17-18, 2022 Meetingstart working towards a statute draft to be ready by this summer to potentially ask for Governor 1418 Dunleavy's support, or alternatively, to have a proj ect ready by the fall to seek legislative sponsors. 1419 1420 The board discussed the following topics but decided not to pursue further efforts at this time: 1421 1422 National certification (New; board can require nationally certification of existing licensed 1423 technicians per LAW opinion) 1424 Equivalent drug products (AS 08.80.400; already in HB 145) 1425 Pharmacist reimbursement and recognition as providers (already in HB 145) 1426 The board identified the following areas to potentially build a statute project: 1427 1428 The board ultimately decided to pursue further efforts for the following: 1429 prohibited terms (AS 08.80.420) 1434 9Add technician seat to board membership; possibly remove 1 public seat (AS 08.80.010) 1435 1436 TASK 24 1437 Laura Carrillo will add statute interests to the board's annual report as well as to subsequent 1438 meeting agendas for further discussion. 1439 1440 Legislation 1441 HB 237 - pharmacists; dispensing of medication for treatment of COVID-19 and related diseases. 1442 Mr. Henderson stated that the language compelling pharmacists to not evaluate the medication for 1443 patient safety is in direct contradiction to what pharmacists do and Dr. Schaber added it is in the 1444 listed in the practice of pharmacy definition in AS 08.80.400(30). Dr. Ruffridge was puzzled on 1445 how this made its way through legislative drafti ng. Mr. Henderson stated that this bill is 1446 unnecessary because our board has never denied a license or imposed a disciplinary section for 1447 dispensing a medication as prescribed by a physician, nor have threatened to discipline. Dr. 1448 Ruffridge expressed that a mandate to dispens e any medication sets a dangerous precedence. 1449 1450 On a motion duly made by Justin Ruffridg e to oppose HB237, an act relating to 1451 pharmacists dispensing medication for treatmen t of COVID-19 and related diseases for 1452 reasons stated on the record, seconded by La na Bell, and approved unanimously, it was: 1453 1454 RESOLVED to oppose Leif Holm x 1463 Sharon Long x 1464 The motion passed with no further discussion. 14651466 HB 145 - Expand pharmacist authority. 1467 Dr. Schaber reiterated previous statements that this was a collaboration with the AKPhA and the 1468 board of pharmacy and should be supported. Dr. Ruffridge agrees it should be supported, 1469 highlighting it includes non-discrimination language on pharmacists with regards to insurance 1470 reimbursement. Dr. Ruffridge further stated the bill should be supported for the following 1471 reasons: 1472 1473 xClarifies language to more closely align with what pharmacists can legally do within their 1474 existing scope of practice; 1475 Adds non-discrimination language for pharmacists with regards to reimbursement; 1476 Was a collaboration between the AKPhA and the board to elevate pharmacy practice; and 1477 Expands workforce capacity by allowing a pharmacy technician working under the 1478 direction of a pharmacist to administer vaccines or related emergency medication. 14791480 On a motion duly made by Justin Ruffridg e to support HB145, an act to expand 1481 pharmacist authority, seconded by Lana Bell, and approved 1482 RESOLVED support Bell Leif Holm x 1492 Sharon Long x 1493 The motion passed with no further discussion. 1494 1495 HB91/SB132 - Exempt veterinarians from PDMP. 1496 Mr. Henderson stated it Dr. Delker's concerns made sense, for example with birthdays and names 1497 of pets not matching up. Dr. Schaber also appreciated hearing the perspective of Dr. Delker but 1498 suggested the board should continue to stay neutral as per the letter submitted last year. Mr. 1499 Henderson expressed interest in freeing up time for veterinarians otherwise spent on the PDMP. 1500 5537 Alaska Board of PharmacyFebruary 17-18, 2022 MeetingDr. Ruffridge stated that in the past, the board ha s addressed ways to improve matters but that 1501 solutions have not worked. Dr. Ruffridge's opinion is that the veterinarians should be exempt. 1502 1503 Ms. Bell inquired whether intentionally hurting an imals is actually occurring. Ms. Carrillo stated 1504 she's received calls from veterinarians who believed clients were intentionally hurting their pets. 1505 Ms. Carrillo added she referred the veterinarians to file a complaint with the investigative unit so 1506 does not know the outcome of those concerns. Dr. Ruffridge shared that the DEA has also heard 1507 of veterinarians reporting that clients hurt their animals. Ms. Carrillo added there are concerns 1508 across many professions with time constraints but recommended delegating reviewing and 1509 reporting duties to delegates, since only 18% of authorized veterinarian delegates are registered. 1510 Dr. Ruffridge further expressed support for this bill for the following reasons: 1511 1512 xDrug diversion from pets has not been an issue in Alaska; 1513 xRequirements are burdensome in an already understaffed field; and 1514 xExcusing veterinarians aligns better with the intent for the PDMP to function properly. 1515 1516 On a motion duly made by Justin Ruffridge to support HB91/SB132, an act to exempt 1517 veterinarians from the PDMP ,seconded by Lana Bell, and approv ed by the majority with one 1518 nay, it was: 1519 1520 RESOLVED to support SB132. 15211522 APPROVE DENY ABSTAIN ABSENT 1523 Bell Leif Holm x 1529 Sharon Long x 1530 The motion passed with no further discussion. 15311532 HB 266 - information regarding vaccines. 1533 Dr. Ruffridge reviewed this legislation and commented that adding a definition to \"vaccine\" is 1534 unnecessary and expressed opposition that vaccines are designed to be administered only after the 1535 patient gives voluntary consent, when this is not what it is designed for. Dr. Schaber expressed an 1536 interest in staying neutral. Mr. Henderson al so expressed opposition. Dr. Ruffridge further 1537 expressed opposition for this bill for the following reasons: 1538 1539 xthe definition of vaccine is already implied in the definition of \"biological product\" in AS 1540 Meetingxthere is redundancy with regulations in regard to the independent administration of 1542 vaccines, including consent, reporting to VAERS, requiring emergency protocols, requiring 1543 training prior to giving a vaccine, requiring a display of certificate of training, requiring 1544 CPR/AED, and vaccine storage handling and maintenance. 1545 On a motion duly made by James Henderson to oppose HB266, an act related to vaccine 1546 information, seconded by Justin Ruffridge, and approved unanimously, 1547 RESOLVED Lana Bell x 1553 Tammy Lindemuth x 1555 Ashley Schaber x 1556 Leif Holm x 1557 Sharon Long x 1558 The motion passed with no further discussion. 1559 1560 HB306 - Board of Pharmacy sunset. 1561 Dr. Ruffridge stated HB306 should be supported so the board can: 15621563 xBenefit Alaskans by promulgating regulations and operating 1564 pharmacies. 1565 xAdminister the PDMP regarding access to dispensing of controlled substances. 1566 xEnsure the practice of pharmacy complies within state law. 1567 xParticipate in investigative matters to protect the profession and public. 1568 xParticipate in national association activities and collaborate with other state boards. 1569 xReview state exam items regularly and ensure competent applicants can pass them to 1570 qualify for licensure. 1571 xEnsure patients have safe and efficient access to medications. 1572 xEnsure the practice of pharmacy is collaborative and cohesive. 1573 1574 Ms. Carrillo also inquired whether she could ad d the following highlights of board activity: 1575 1576 xImplementing regulations for third-party logistics providers, outsourcing 1577 facilities, and third-party logistics providers to improve the safety of the drug 1578 supply chain. 1579 xExpanding workforce capacity by creating new regulations and duties for 1580 pharmacy technicians who hold a national certification. 1581 5739 Alaska Board of PharmacyFebruary 17-18, 2022 MeetingxExpanding the limitation on prescription supply days to ensure patients have an 1582 adequate supply of medication. 1583 xEmergency regulations filed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing 1584 expanded shared pharmacy services functions and temporary pharmacy 1585 relocations without requiring a separate license, promoting continuation of 1586 medication therapy, and providing support to licensees on PREP Act inquiries. 1587 1588 On a motion duly made by Justin Ruffridg e to support HB306, an act to expand 1589 pharmacist authority, seconded by James Henderson, and approved unanimously, it was: 1590 1591 RESOLVED to support HB306.

Historical Note 97New Section made by final rulemaking at 25 A.A.R. 1012, effective June 1, 2019 (Supp. Filing Caption per ORS 183.335(2)(a)(A) (identifies the subject matter of the agency's intended action max 15 words): Establishes new registration for Pharmacy Prescription Lockers (PPLs) Need for Rules per ORS 183.335(2)(b)(C) (describes what we are changing in rule): Proposes rules that establish a new registration type for Pharmacy Prescription Lockers (PPL). Adds new Division 143 which contains requirements for the operation of a PPL by a PPL Affiliated Pharmacy. Documents Relied Upon per ORS 183.335(2)(b)(D): None Resources: Prescription lockers are the patient faci ng pick-up units that hold prescription, non- prescription drugs, devices and supplies already prepared by the pharmacy - Parata Wellspot Locker - Scriptcenter LS - iLocalbox Fiscal & Economic Impact per ORS 183.335(2)(b)(E): The agency sent out a fiscal impact request for estimated costs associated with compliance, implementation and operation of a PPL. Cost of Compliance - (Stakeholders): On 1/24/2022 a fiscal impact request was sent to 1,419 interested party email addresses and 1,444 PIC email addresses. The agency received 1 response with the following estimates: - Locker purchase: $40,000- $80,000 - Locker lease: month - Surveillance systems: $10,000 initially, then $100-500 per month for data storage Pharmacies are not required to operate a Pharmacy Prescription Locker (PPL). If a pharmacy chooses to operate a PPL, the PPL Affiliated Pharmacy will be required to apply and pay a registration fee of $225 for the PPL and be required to comply with all Oregon Administrative Rules and Oregon Revised Statutes. We do anticipate that licensed drug outlets may be financially impacted in order to comply with the proposed rules. Pharmacies that choose to deploy lockers will generate revenue from prescription and over-the-counter drug sales to help offset the cost of compliance with these proposed rules. OBOP/Other State Agencies/Units of Local Government/Public: Fiscal impact is estimated to be minimal for the agency and limited to administrative and compliance costs. There is no anticipated fiscal impact to other state agencies, units of local government or the public. Cost of Compliance (including small businesses): There are approximately 113 small business drug outlet pharmacies registered with the board. It is not anticipated that the cost of compliance for small business would be different from that of a non-small business. Describe how small businesses were involved in development of the rules: Small businesses were not involved with the development of the proposed rules. )(%58$5<\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0015\u0015\u0012%\u0016 99Oregon Board of Pharmacy Div 006/143 Pharmacy Prescription v. 2/2022Was a RAC consulted? If no, why? per ORS 183.335(2)(b)(G): A RAC was not consulted for the development of these rules. The board held a technology forum during the August 2020 board meeting where vendors presented information and resources for the board's consideration prior to drafting proposed rules. Racial Equity statement per ORS 183.335(2)(b)(F): (identifying how adoption of rule might impact one group of people differently than others) Large, urban, predominantly white communities usually have multiple pharmacies to choose from, but in smaller, rural, and lower socioeconomic areas, even within cities, it can be much more difficult to find an open pharmacy. The proposed rules may positively impact Oregonian's access to pick up prescriptions without having to physically visit an open pharmacy. No contact delivery/pick-up has become necessary for many health-related services due to the ongoing public health emergency. Rules Summary per ORS 183.335(2)(a)(B) (indicates the change to the rule and why): Rules establish a new drug outlet type of Pharmacy Prescription Loc kers (PPLs) and permit a pharmacy to operate a PPL.

Utilizing qualified interpreters will ensure that proper communication occurs to allow the LEP patient to achieve desired health outcomes. The ability to access an interpreter who can speak the patient's preferred language will have a positive impact on patients from a variety of racial and ethnic ba ckgrounds who may have barriers to communication in English. There is limited data about the health status and health needs of people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT). In Oregon, approximately 20,000 Oregonians (1 out of every 171) identify as transgender. Sex assigned at birth is an important, structured variable that is used to facilitate effective patient care that is efficient, equitable, and patient-centered. Sex assigned at birth in a patient's medical record is often used to calcul ate medication dosages and screen for drug interactions for a patient's typical hormonal history and anatomy. The proposed rules regarding patient records are intended to provide pharmacists with the information they need for accurate dosage calculations and drug interaction screening while also recognizing the importance of recognizing patients by their chosen name and preferred gender identification. Rules Summary per ORS 183.335(2)(a)(B) (Indicates the change to the rule and why): Proposed amendments are necessary to incorporate directives set forth in 2021 HB 2359 , related to health care interpreters.

As the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continued affecting the operations, priorities, and goals of agencies providing critic al care services to the public across the nation and the state, the Board of Pharmacy remained zealous in its efforts to safeguard the integrity of its profession while keeping patient safety at the forefront of its pursuits. In FY22, the Board of Pharmacy: publ ished guidance to its licensees on scope of practice expansion authority to provide services related to the testing and treatment of COVID-19; expanded patient access to medications by extending supply-day thresholds for initial and refill prescriptions; and relaxed license qualification requirements using a barrier-reduction regulatory framework to scale-up pharmacy services and support the growth of the Alaskan economy. FY21-22 marked the beginning of the board's first sunset audit since 2017, which both acknowledged the proliferation of regulatory projects drafted and implemented by the board and provided areas where improved regulatory oversight can be concentrated to further advance its profession and improve patient care. House Bill 306, sponsored by Representative Andi Story , which passed the legislature at the final hour of the FY22 session, extends the Board of Pharmacy through June 30, 2028. While not the full eight (8)-year period that would have extend the board through 2030, the six (6)-year extension is necessitated by the need to reassess the administration and oversight of the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP), the state's controlled substance prescription database and interactive technological tool to assist providers in combating the opioid epidemic. As the PDMP affects a total of six (6) professions regulated by the State Medical Board, Board of Nursing, Board of Examiners in Optometry, Board of Veterinary Examiners, and Board of Dental Examiners, and the Board of Pharmacy, the legislature expects to see continued collaboration among these boards and their constituents. The sunset audit also illuminated inherent statutory limitations that impose challenges on the board's ability to satisfy repor ting requirements to the legislature and its ability to comply with federal grant deliverables. Driven by collaborative ownership of the program, the board chair of each PDMP-affected profession continued to convene its PDMP Chairs Group on a bi-weekly basis in FY21, which began in FY20 as a unified approach to discuss and identify barriers and challenges of the system and to strategize best approaches to, practices for, and priorities for PDMP data usage and dissemination. At the request of the legislature, DCC ED - CBPL is procuring a consultant in FY23 to analyze the structure of the PDMP, assess effectiveness of program administration and regulation, and to provide recommendations on how the system can more aptly align with its legislative intent to support judicious prescribing and reduce diversion and abuse of federally-scheduled controlled substances. Other relevant legislation that passed in FY22 include House Bill 145, an effort lead by the Alaska Pharmacist Association (AKP hA) with support from and collaboration with the board. HB 145 will update language to recognize pharmacists' existing ability to prescribe certain medications, such as vaccines and opioid overdose drugs--a bill that welcomes Alaska to a group of only five (5) states that recognize pharmacists' ability to independently prescribe. This law also acknowledges pharmacists as providers who are trained, qualified, and competent to render certain independent general health and wellness, disease prevention, and medication therapy services without entering into a cooperative practice agreement with a prescriber, and without facing insurance discrimination under Title 21. HB 145 further supports the effective regulation and expansion of pharmacy services by permitting pharmacy technicians to administer vaccinations under pharmacist supervision. Additionally, the board supported the Alaska State Veterinary Medical Association (AKVMA) and the Alaska Board of Veterinary Examiner's PDMP exemption bills, HB 91 and its companion bill, SB 132; however, these bills did not pass in FY22. In tangential efforts, the Controlled Substances Advisory Subcommittee (CSAC) continues to be led by the Board of Pharmacy's chair or chair's delegate. In FY22, the CSAC continued discussing recently emerging substances of abuse, including kratom and gabapentin. This year, the CSAC decided to put forward a recommendation that Governor Dunleavy schedule kratom as a state-controlled substance to enable prosecution authority and to reduce the diversion and misuse of this substance. FY 2022 Annual Report Narrative Statement (ontinued) FY 2022 Annual Report - >\u0003\u0012\u0003DW, \u0003\u0004Alaska Board of Pharmacy 134On the regulatory front, the board held timely quarterly and special teleconference meetings to push forward a compilation of r egulatory proposals, a bulk of which were crafted in FY2020 but forced into abeyance due to the pandemic, including language related to t he license renewal of non-resident wholesale drug distributors, outsourcing facilities, and third-party logistics providers. These license categories were brought under the purview of the board to regulate in FY19, though proposed renewal language will likely be codified in FY23. Additionally, the board implemented regulations in FY22 related to: Clarifying requirements for registration with and reporting to the PDMP, including delegate access. Establishing a timeframe for which pharmacists and pharmacies are to report to the board its status of dispensing/distributing federally-scheduled II - IV controlled substances within 10 days Clarifying duties for pharmacy technicians with national certification Support and facilitate expedited licensure for active duty military members and spouse of military members pursuing licensure as a technician, intern, or pharmacist Broaden qualifications for emergency permit issuance to quickly deploy adequate personnel for pharmacies and patients in need In FY23, the board also intends to implement regulations to: Reduce barriers to initial licensure for individuals, including eliminating transcript and notary requirements for individuals and expanding acceptable formats of license verifications Reduce barriers to initial licensure for pharmacies and facilities, including eliminating inspection-report, fingerprint/background report requirements, and certified true copy requirements Remove onerous requirements to licensure renewal, including allowing attestations in lieu of original documents and removing requirements to provide certified true copies Create a comprehensive joint application for providers to submit a collaborative practice agreement application to the Stat e Medical Board and Board of Pharmacy for approval. Draft regulations to support and correspond to statute changes as a result of HB145 Develop a licensure process for entities involved in the manufacture of prescription drugs Implement regulations improving and expediting the license process for active duty military members and/or their spouse Amend regulations to improve access to telepharmacy services The board is also excited to highlight developments and engagements of both new and existing partnerships with agencies sharing common goals to promote parity in health care, support accessibility of treatment to underserved and geographically-challenged areas a nd populations, and identify and address challenges and opportunities to support valued personnel within a demanding pharmaceutical infrastruct ure.

The May 2022 Report for District 7 states is attached. A small bump in the number of assessors continues this month that is believed to be primarily due topromotion of the WBI tool at APhA2022. The overall distress percent ticked up again this month butis still just below 32% at 31.98%. The reason a distress percent goes up or down when the number of assessors remains the same isreassessments. Current assessors may reassess as many times as they would like, and thosereassessments will change the distress percent without changing the number of assessors. Thismonth, 51% (n=8399) 49% (n=8080) arereassessments. This month's report includes a slide the number of first-timeassessments, number of reassessments, number of unique reassessment assessors, and totalreassessments for each state in your district. As a reminder, each state's distress percent rank is expressed as \"ranked X/52\". If the state's rank is 5/52, it means that the state has the 5 th highest distress percent of the 52 jurisdictions (50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico). For your reference, the APhA/NASPA 2021 Pharmacy Workplace Survey Final Report was releasedlate last week. The press release for the Final Report can be found here .

If you have any questions on the below announcements, please reach out to us at IGA@fda.hhs.gov . FDA Warnings and Recalls On May 27, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration provided an update on additional steps it has taken that will lead to more infant formula on U.S. store shelves in the coming weeksand months. \"We continue to work around the clock with our government partners andindustry to ensure there's adequate infant formula available wherever and wheneverparents and caregivers need it,\" said FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf, M.D. \"Steps likethe one the agency is taking today means more infant formula will be available to parentsand caregivers in the weeks and months ahead. We will not rest until our shelves arereplete with safe and nutritious infant formula.\" Under the agency's recent increased flexibilities , Bubs Australia plans to provide at least 1.25 million cans of several varieties of its infant formula such as stage 1 and 2 cans of Bubs Organic Grass Fed, Bubs Supreme A2 Beta-Casein Protein and Bubs Easy-digest Goat Milk, that will make at least 27.5 million full- size, 8-ounce bottles. Some of this product is currently in stock for transport and additional 274product is being produced in the coming weeks and months. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is evaluating options for getting the products to the U.S. as quickly aspossible. The company has information about the products and where to find product once inthe U.S. on the Aussie Bubs website . The Food and Drug Administration provided an update on steps it has taken that will lead to millions of bottles of specialized medical infant formula to help addressimmediate needs for infants with certain allergies or critical health conditions , on May 26, 2022. This type of specialized medical infant formula is currently in shortsupply in the U.S. \"We have made tremendous progress, including notable steps in just the past week, which will allow us to immediately begin bringing specialty andinfant formula products into the U.S. as quickly as possible,\" said FDA CommissionerRobert M. Califf, M.D. \"We continue to work closely with our U.S. governmentpartners and domestic and international manufacturers to identify additionalformula product that will be available to parents and caregivers in the weeks andmonths ahead. It is our goal to ensure that hospitals, specialty pharmacies, andretail store shelves will begin seeing adequate supplies again in the comingweeks.\" About 500,000 additional cans of specialized medical formulamanufactured by Danone's Nutricia business will be headed to the U.S. These Neocate amino acid-based formula products -- some of which are alreadymanufactured for the U.S. market and are made at facilities in Europe -- amounts tomore than 5 million full-size, 8-ounce bottles. The U.S. Department of Health andHuman Services and Danone continue to partner to evaluate options for getting theproducts to the U.S. as quickly as possible. The specialized medical formula is expectedto be distributed through direct ordering, hospitals, health care professionals,pharmacies, healthcare product distributors and Special Supplemental NutritionProgram for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) local access points to ensure they getto the infants who rely on these products. On May 24, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration announced that it will exercise enforcement discretion with respect to specific infant formula products to increaseinfant formula supplies in the United States.

Photo examples are 275included below. FDA has posted a list of additional recalls being conducted by companies that have used the recalled Jif peanut butter as an ingredient in the manufacturing of a new product (e.g., chocolate products) or in repackaging the product (e.g., snack cups).This list will be updated as the agency receives notification of new recalls.

Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal Governments XII. References I. Executive Summary A. Purpose of the Proposed Rule The Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA) was enacted on November 27, 2013. Title II of the DQSA, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA), includes provisions designed to strengthen the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Among other measures, section 204 of the DSCSA amends section 503(e) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 353(e)), which requires licensure of prescription drug wholesale distributors (wholesale distributors or wholesale drug distributors or WDDs) and adds section 583 to the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360eee-2), which requires FDA to establish by regulation national standards for the licensure of prescription drug wholesale distributors. Section 205 of the DSCSA adds section 584 to the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360eee-3), which requires licensure of third-party logistics providers and requires FDA to establish, by regulation, national standards for the licensure of third-party logistics providers. This proposed regulation, when finalized, will establish the national standards for the licensure of wholesale drug distributors and 3PLs required under sections 583 and 584 of the FD&C Act, as amended by the DSCSA. As required by statute, the standards, terms and conditions for licensure established by this regulation will apply to both Federal and State licenses (503(e)(1)(B), 583(b), and 584(a)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act). As discussed in section X (Federalism), section 585(b)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360eee-4(b)(1)) preempts States and localities from establishing or continuing requirements for 3PL or WDD licensure that are different from the national standards and requirements applicable under sections 584 and 503(e) of the FD&C Act. However, the statutory provisions themselves do not establish these ''standards and requirements''; instead, this regulation, once effective, will establish them. Accordingly, State and local licensure requirements will be preempted only once this regulation, when finalized, takes effect; until such time, current licensing of WDDs and 3PLs may continue. As discussed below, this determination will help avoid supply chain disruption, based on licensing uncertainties, during the period between DSCSA's enactment and the effective date of this regulation. Avoiding such interim period supply chain issues accords with Congress's overall intent to secure and strengthen the supply chain, as evidenced by other FD&C Act provisions added by DSCSA that recognize State licensure of WDDs and 3PLs prior to this regulation becoming effective. In addition, pursuant to section 585(c) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360eee-4(c)), regulation of areas within the historical police powers of the States would be unaffected by this regulation, including prohibiting employees of WDDs and 3PLs from engaging in criminal activity related to prescription drugs, provided that the State requirements involved are not related to licensure of 3PLs or WDDs. The requirements for state licensing of wholesale distributors are currently established under 21 CFR part 205, and FDA is now proposing the withdrawal of that regulation and for part 205 to be replaced with this proposed rule. Where a state from which a drug is being distributed has not established a licensing program in accordance with the regulation, the DSCSA establishes FDA as the licensing authority for wholesale distributor and 3PL licenses (sections 503(e)(1)(A)(i)(II) and 584(a)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act). When finalized, the national standards set forth in the proposed rule will provide greater assurance that these supply chain participants are sufficiently vetted and qualified to distribute products, further strengthening the supply chain and the safety of prescription drugs provided to American consumers. When finalized, this proposed rule will also set forth the standards applicable to, and the requirements for approval of, third-party organizations involved in the licensure and inspection process (''approved organizations'' or ''AOs''). Sections 583(c) and 584(d)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act provide, respectively, that FDA may approve ''third-party accreditation'' or inspection services or programs to conduct inspections of facilities used by wholesale distributors seeking licensure and to review the qualifications of 3PLs for licensure. This proposed rule will also address the standards and requirements for approving such third- party accreditation or inspection services or programs. Overall, this proposed rule is designed to ensure that the supply chain remains secure and that those prescription drugs subject to the DSCSA that are moving through the supply chain are properly stored, handled, and transported. These measures are intended to help protect American consumers from drugs that may be counterfeit, stolen, contaminated, or otherwise harmful. For purposes of this proposed rule, FDA has defined ''entity'' or ''entities'' to mean a business organization, such as a corporation, company, association, firm, partnership, society, or joint stock company. Unless otherwise noted, the term ''3PL'' or ''third-party logistics provider'' in this proposed rule includes both the 3PL entity and the individual 3PL facilities requiring a license. B. Summary of the Major Provisions of the Proposed Rule FDA is proposing to replace the current part 205 with a new part 205 that will implement the licensure requirements of the DSCSA and govern licensure of 3PLs and wholesale distributors. When finalized, the new part 205 will replace the existing part 205 in its entirety. Subpart A will set forth the national licensing standards for State and Federal licenses issued to 3PLs pursuant to section 584 of the FD&C Act, and subpart C will set forth the national licensing standards for State and Federal licenses issued to wholesale distributors pursuant to sections 503(e) (as amended) and 583 of the FD&C Act. Subparts B and D will set forth the applicable standards and processes for approved organizations to perform licensure reviews and conduct inspections. 1. National Standards for the Licensure of Third-Party Logistics Providers The DSCSA identifies 3PLs as separate members of the drug supply chain\u2014distinct from wholesale drug distributors\u2014and specifically precludes States from regulating 3PLs as wholesale distributors (585(b)(2) of the FD&C Act). FDA is required by section 584 of the FD&C Act to establish national standards for the licensure Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 24 / Friday, February 4, 2022 / Proposed Rules the Agency is proposing those standards in subpart A of proposed part 205. When finalized, each facility of an entity meeting the definition of a 3PL in section 581(22) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360eee(22)) will be required to be licensed by a State or Federal licensing authority in accordance with the standards articulated in subpart A of proposed part 205. 2. National Standards for the Licensure of Wholesale Drug Distributors Prior to DSCSA's enactment, wholesale distributors engaging in interstate commerce were required to be licensed by the State in which they were operating pursuant to section 503(e)(2) of the FD&C Act (as then in effect). This section established minimum standards, terms, and conditions for licensing of wholesale distributors pre-DSCSA. As required by sections 503(e)(1)(B) (as amended by the DSCSA) and 583 of the FD&C Act, FDA is proposing to establish national standards, terms, and conditions through this rulemaking for the licensure of wholesale distributors that, when final, will apply to all State licensing programs as well as to the new Federal licensing program to be operated by FDA. These new standards would replace the previous standards set forth in current part 205. 3. Approval of Third Parties To Conduct Licensure Reviews and Inspections In accordance with section 584(d)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act, FDA is proposing to establish a process by which third-party organizations will be approved by FDA to review a 3PL's qualifications for licensure. In addition, in accordance with section 583(c) of the FD&C Act, FDA is proposing to establish a process by which third-party organizations will be approved by FDA to conduct inspections of wholesale distributors for the purpose of licensure. 4. Conforming Changes The regulation also proposes to amend 21 CFR 10.50(c) and 12.21(a)(2), which list statutory authorities that provide the opportunity for a formal evidentiary public hearing under 21 CFR part 12. Because the regulation proposes that wholesale distributors and 3PLs could request a formal evidentiary public hearing under part 12 for review of decisions affecting the denial, suspension, or revocation of 3PL or wholesale distributor licenses issued by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary), sections 503(e), 583, and 584 of the FD&C Act would be added to the list of statutory sections under which there is the opportunity for a hearing under \u00a7\u00a7 10.50(c) and 12.21(a)(2), regarding such decisions. We are also proposing a conforming change to 21 CFR 16.1(b) to describe procedures for regulatory hearings that would add actions related to approved organizations under proposed \u00a7\u00a7 205.19 and 205.33 respectively, including revocation or suspension of approval, to the list of actions for which a regulatory hearing under 21 CFR part 16 may be held. C. Legal Authority We are issuing this proposed rule under sections 301, 501, 502, 503(e), 582, 583, 584, 585, 701(a), and 704 of the FD&C Act (21 352, 353(e), 360eee-1, 360eee-2, 360eee-3, 360eee-4, 371(a), and 374). D. Costs and Benefits In this rulemaking, we propose new national standards for the licensing of prescription drug wholesale distributors and third-party logistics providers as directed under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, Title II of the Drug Quality and Security Act. If finalized, the rule would also establish a Federal licensing system for wholesale drug distributors and third-party logistics providers to use in the absence of a state licensure program that is consistent with the proposed national standards. The standards for prescription drug wholesale distribution in the proposed rule would result in benefits to consumers and benefits to distributors from reducing the diversion of prescription drugs. Other monetized benefits include cost savings from reducing the frequency and quantity of licensure applications and cost savings from reducing state licensing standards in some states. We estimate that the annualized benefits over 10 years would range from $1.25 million to $31.50 million at a 7 percent discount rate, with a primary estimate of $10.66 million. We estimate that the annualized benefits would range from $1.26 million to $32.18 million at a 3 percent discount rate, with a primary estimate of $10.89 million. We also expect that the proposed rule, if finalized, would impose costs on wholesale drug distributors, third-party logistics providers, states, approved organizations, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Costs to wholesale drug distributors and third- party logistics providers include costs of learning about the rule, reporting to FDA, undergoing routine inspections, writing and revising standard operating procedures, and conducting background checks. Wholesale-drug distributors would also incur costs to furnish surety bonds to their state licensing authority to obtain or renew their licenses. Costs to states include the time spent reading and understanding the rule, passing or revising the laws and regulations governing their licensure programs, and inspecting WDD and 3PL facilities. Approved organizations would incur legal, application, and training costs, as well as costs to inspect WDD and 3PL facilities. FDA costs include the costs to establish and operate a reporting database and a licensure program for wholesale drug distributors and third-party logistics providers and the costs to establish and operate an approval program for approved organizations. We estimate that the annualized costs over 10 years would range from $13.21 million to $20.63 million at a 7 percent discount rate, with a primary estimate of $16.92 million. We estimate that the annualized costs over 10 years at a 3 percent discount rate would range from $12.83 million to $20.10 million, with a primary estimate of $16.47 million. II.

L. 113- 54) was signed into law on November 27, 2013, to better protect the U.S. drug supply chain. FDA's implementation of the DSCSA includes many activities, including this proposed rule. Once final, this rule will establish national standards for licensure of wholesale distributors and 3PLs, as required by the DSCSA. For information on additional FDA activities related to the DSCSA, a web page describing FDA's implementation activities can be found at: https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ DrugSafety/DrugIntegrityandSupplyChainSecurity/DrugSupplyChainSecurityAct/default.htm. B. Need for the Regulation: The DSCSA and Establishment of National Standards for Licensure The U.S. drug supply chain remains one of the safest in the world. However, the increasingly globalized nature of the supply chain brings with it complexities VerDate Sep<11>2014 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 24 / Friday, February 4, 2022 / Proposed Rules that increase threats to the safety and security of the U.S. drug supply. A breach at any point in the supply chain carries potential for dangerous, and even deadly, outcomes for American consumers. In passing the DSCSA, Congress recognized the need for national standards for the storage, handling, and transport of prescription drugs and directed FDA, in sections 583(a) and 584(d) of the FD&C Act, to establish such standards by regulation for WDDs and 3PLs, respectively. These national standards will help diminish opportunities for dangerous and criminal conduct affecting the supply of prescription drugs in the United States. When final, every U.S. wholesale distributor and 3PL facility will be held to these standards through the statute's licensure requirements. Where a State does not have a licensing program in accordance with the regulation, FDA will be the licensing authority. This proposed rule, when finalized, will provide much needed certainty and clarity for wholesale distributors and 3PLs seeking licensure. In passing the DSCSA, Congress believed the existing system of different regulation regarding supply chain security by each state created a patchwork system of governance and that a uniform national standard would address this concern. See statements of Senator Mikulski (Ref 1), Congressmen Mathis (Ref 2) and Congressman Latta (Ref 3). Requirements for wholesale distributors currently vary significantly across State lines, and many wholesale distributors and 3PLs have facilities in multiple States. Specifically, State requirements and standards for licensure can vary on topics such as the length of time for which records must be maintained; qualifications of facility managers and designated representatives; facility requirements; licensure duration; renewal procedures; exemptions from the definition of wholesale distribution; and inspection and approval requirements by certain, specific organizations in order to receive licensure in certain States. This proposed rule, when finalized will be an important first step in harmonizing these requirements, thus allowing for greater compliance and management of licensure. Additionally, we note that commenters on FDA's draft guidance entitled ''The Effect of Section 585 of the FD&C Act on Drug Product Tracing and Wholesale Drug Distributor and Third-Party Logistics Provider Licensing Standards and Requirements: Questions and Answers'' (Ref 4) agreed that creation of a uniform national standard for licensure, through the issuance of these regulations, should be the goal of FDA (see, e.g., Ref 5). Commenters noted that the patchwork of licensing standards was precisely the regulatory burden that the DSCSA was intended to eliminate. (see, e.g., Ref 6) Comments added that tracking and complying with different standards in different States on a continuing basis would be very time consuming and add unnecessary costs to the distribution chain (see, e.g., Ref 7). We believe that the issuance of these regulations, when finalized, will provide far greater clarity to both States and regulated industry as to the requirements and expectations FDA has with respect to licensure. The publication of these regulations, when finalized, and the approach to preemption discussed in this document will reflect the national standard Congress intended, but will detail FDA's expectations with respect to licensure. This will allow for greater certainty in the logistics and distribution industry, and in the supply chain as a whole. Since the passage of DSCSA, States have implemented disparate policies with respect to licensure of 3PLs. Some States repealed or eliminated 3PL as a licensure category, others are waiting for FDA to publish its regulations before determining how to proceed, some are licensing 3PLs under some other form of licensure, and some do not regulate 3PLs at all (Ref 8). These regulations, when finalized, will provide certainty and clarity in the logistics industry. The Agency believes finalizing these proposed regulations is crucial to implementation of licensure of 3PLs as intended by DSCSA. Under section 582(a)(7) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360eee-1(a)(7)), 3PLs are deemed licensed until the effective date of these regulations unless the Secretary has made a finding that the 3PL does not utilize good handling and distribution practices and publishes notice thereof. Until these regulations are issued, and the framework for licensure established, the Agency cannot institute the provisions and the goals of DSCSA\u2014to further secure the supply chain by including 3PLs as an authorized member of the supply chain through the licensure provisions, which will ensure that they are appropriately credentialed, inspected, and therefore duly qualified to participate in the supply chain. Theft and diversion of prescription drugs continue to be major issues, contributing to drug shortages and creating significant financial losses, the effects of which cascade throughout the supply chain to consumers. FDA has observed that these instances often involve products distributed by unlicensed wholesale distributors. FDA standards, oversight, and regulations, including to implement the requirements of DSCSA, will lessen and hopefully eliminate product diversion in the legitimate supply chain. According to the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP)'s 2013 report entitled ''Wholesale Drug Distribution: Protecting the Integrity of the Nation's Prescription Drug Supply,'' drug diverters and bad actors seek out gaps in the distribution and regulatory structure, specifically seeking out States whose licensure framework is less stringent (Ref. 9). This proposed rule, when finalized, and the preemption of inconsistent State provisions will remedy this forum shopping for drug diverters who seek to take advantage of the lack of uniform framework. Additionally, NABP's 2013 report also contends that the so-called ''five percent rule'' is a policy that has been ripe for exploitation due to the policy being inconsistently legislated, interpreted, and enforced from State to State. This was a policy under which FDA had previously concluded that sales of prescription drugs by a retail pharmacy to licensed practitioners for office use would be considered to be minimal and not constitute wholesale distribution, if the total dollar volume of these sales does not exceed 5 percent of the total dollar volume of that retail pharmacy's annual prescription sales (see further discussion in ''Definitions'' section below). However, this interpretation was not codified. The NABP observed that ''pharmacies acting as wholesalers have been found to take advantage of the parameters set by some States [regarding minimal quantities] when it comes to drug distribution. Rather than dispensing the drugs as mandated, these pharmacies retain them to resell to wholesalers at an amount exceeding the specified quantity of prescription medications as permitted in certain States (often times 5% of annual sales). Some have gone as far as to sell their entire inventory into the gray market'' This proposed rule, when finalized, codifies the principle that the five percent rule only applies to pharmacy sales for office use. Sales above five percent for office use, or any sales to a wholesale distributor, require the pharmacy to become licensed and regulated as a wholesale distributor. This proposed rule will clarify this requirement and close a potential loophole that could lead to diversion of products and excessive sales from dispensers who are not licensed and registered as wholesale distributors VerDate Sep<11>2014 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 24 / Friday, February 4, 2022 / Proposed Rules when they are engaging in wholesale distribution. Unlicensed wholesale distribution has been a major source of diverted products both leaving and reentering the supply chain. Significant amounts of drug diversion involve wholesale distributors, either diverting the product themselves from the supply chain, or purchasing product that was diverted by another actor. The DSCSA, which requires uniform national standards for licensure of wholesale distributors, will cut down on these types of instances of diversion since supply chain trading partners are required to transact with only other trading partners who meet the strict requirements laid out in these regulations. There are many examples of diversion and criminal action by wholesale distributors under the current regulatory scheme, which these regulations, when finalized, will discourage, or possibly even prevent, in the future. As an example, from 2007-2014, individuals involved with the Minnesota Independent Cooperative bought prescription drugs from a network of illegal and unlicensed sources and sold approximately $393 million worth of diverted prescription drugs to wholesalers and retail pharmacies throughout the United States. These individuals falsified transactional documents, as well as licensure documents, to enter into fraudulent transactions with dispensers and other wholesalers. In a 2008 example detailed in the indictment, the unlicensed individuals involved allegedly bought a truckload of stolen asthma inhalers for $662,000 and sold them through the Minnesota Independent Collective to another wholesaler for about $1 million (Ref 10). These regulations, when finalized, and the DSCSA requirements that trading partners only transact with authorized, licensed trading partners, and verify suspect and illegitimate product, will make these schemes far more difficult to achieve. Had DSCSA been the prevailing regulatory scheme at the time, other wholesale distributors and dispensers would have been deterred from doing business with the Minnesota Independent Collective because they were not an authorized trading partner. In 2014, two individuals pleaded guilty to their involvement in a drug diversion and distribution scheme through an entity called Cumberland Distribution. Both defendants admitted that Cumberland Distribution purchased prescription drugs from individuals and entities that were not licensed to engage in the wholesale distribution of prescription drugs and were not authorized to distribute prescription drugs. Cumberland Distribution then distributed these products to dispensers. The prescription drugs were acquired through various networks of ''diverters'' who obtained prescription drugs from other unlawful sources. As a result, Cumberland Distribution could not lawfully resell the drugs. Pharmacies throughout the United States purchased these diverted prescription drugs from Cumberland Distribution under the guise that the products had been in the custody of licensed wholesale distributors or other authorized distributors since being sold by the original manufacturer (Ref 11). Under DSCSA, the licensure status of these purported wholesale distributors is easily searchable and verifiable, thus making diversion schemes, such as this, far more difficult to achieve. In addition to requiring FDA to establish national licensure standards, the DSCSA outlines critical steps for building an electronic, interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United States (section 582(g) of the FD&C Act). This system will enhance FDA's ability to protect American consumers from exposure to drugs that may be unfit for distribution and will increase efficiency in the detection and removal of potentially dangerous drugs from the U.S. drug supply chain. The FD&C Act, as amended by DSCSA, requires FDA to establish national standards for the licensure of two critical members of the supply chain: wholesale drug distributors and 3PLs. It also requires that only those wholesale distributors and 3PL facilities licensed according to these national standards may engage in wholesale distribution or 3PL activities, respectively. Only licensed wholesale drug distributors and 3PLs whose facilities are so licensed will be considered ''authorized trading partners'' permitted under the FD&C Act, as amended by DSCSA, to engage in transactions related to the sale and distribution of certain prescription drugs with other members of the supply chain. To create the standards proposed in the regulations, FDA conducted a comprehensive review of existing State standards for licensure including storing, handling, and holding prescription drugs, as well as other nationally recognized standards and model rules for wholesale distribution and logistics, such as those created by the NABP (Ref 12), Healthcare Distribution Alliance (Ref 13), World Health Organization (Ref 14), and the Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention and Pharmaceutical Inspection Co- operation Scheme (jointly referred to as PIC/S) (Ref 15). The Agency believes that the proposed standards align with existing practices and will help ensure that 3PL and wholesale distribution activities are undertaken in a manner that minimizes diversion and threats to the regulated supply chain. C. Changes From the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) Prior to the DSCSA's enactment, the last comprehensive legislative action related to prescription drug distribution was the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 (PDMA) (Pub. L. 100-293). Among other things, the PDMA required wholesale distributors to obtain licenses from States in which they were operating (sec. 6 of the PDMA; also see FDA's 2001 Report to Congress on the PDMA (Ref 16)). Under the PDMA, FDA promulgated regulations that established minimum standards, terms, and conditions for licensure of wholesale distributors. The PDMA provided neither a specific definition of 3PL-type entities nor specific oversight over them; without a distinct regulatory framework for 3PLs, some States chose to regulate and license 3PLs as wholesale distributors, with some others choosing to license 3PLs as separate entities. The DSCSA requires that all wholesale distributor and 3PL licenses meet the standards established by FDA (sections 503(e)(1)(B) and 584(a) of the FD&C Act), and that 3PLs not be licensed as wholesale distributors (section 585(b)(2) of the FD&C Act). If an entity owns a facility in which it is engaging in 3PL activities and wholesale distribution out of the same facility, the entity will be required to hold a 3PL license and a separate wholesale distributor license for the distinct functions they perform. IV. Legal Authority The Agency is proposing this rule under the authority to propose national standards for the licensing of wholesale distributors and 3PLs granted to it by various sections of the FD&C Act, including sections 301, 503(e), 582, 583, 584, 585, 701(a), and 704 (21 351, 352, 360eee-3, 360eee-4, 371(a), and 374). Section 503(e) requires wholesale distributors to be licensed according to the standards, terms, and conditions established by the Secretary, and section 583 requires FDA to establish by regulation national standards for the licensure of prescription drug wholesale distributors. Section 584 requires 3PLs to be licensed according to standards established in regulations promulgated VerDate Sep<11>2014 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 24 / Friday, February 4, 2022 / Proposed Rules by FDA for the licensure of 3PLs. Section 301(t) prohibits the failure to comply with the requirements under sections 584 and 503(e). Section 301 also prohibits a number of actions concerning adulterated and misbranded drugs. Section 585 provides that states cannot implement licensing standards, requirements, or regulations that are inconsistent with, less stringent than, directly related to, or covered by the standards applicable under sections 503(e) and 584. Section 585 also precludes states from regulating 3PLs as wholesale distributors. To enforce these and other provisions of the FD&C Act, section 704 authorizes FDA to conduct inspections. Section 701(a) of the FD&C Act provides general authority to issue regulations for the efficient enforcement of the FD&C Act. By establishing national standards for the licensing of wholesale distributors and 3PLs, this rule, when finalized, is expected to aid in the efficient administration and enforcement of the FD&C Act, and in particular would help efficiently enforce the provisions relating to licensure of wholesale drug distributors and 3PLs. V. Description of the Proposed Rule The national standards for the licensure of 3PLs, required by section 584 of the FD&C Act, as amended by DSCSA, are set forth in subpart A of proposed part 205. The national standards for the licensure of wholesale distributors, required by sections 503(e) and 583 of the FD&C Act, as amended by DSCSA, are set forth in subpart C of proposed part 205. The process and standards for third-party accreditation programs to become approved by the Federal Government to evaluate the qualifications of 3PLs for licensure, as required by section 584(d) of the FD&C Act, are established in subpart B of proposed part 205. The process and standards for third-party accreditation and inspection services to become approved by the Federal Government to conduct inspections of wholesale distributors, as permitted by section 583(c) of the FD&C Act, are set forth in subpart D of proposed part 205. A. Scope/Applicability (Proposed \u00a7\u00a7 205.1 and 205.2) In accordance with section 584 of the FD&C Act, FDA is proposing to establish the national standards for licensing by State and Federal licensing authorities set forth in subpart A of part 205 that would apply to 3PL facilities in any State (see proposed \u00a7 205.1). Furthermore, in accordance with section 503(e)(1) of the FD&C Act, FDA is proposing to establish the national standards for wholesale distributors set forth in subpart C of part 205 that would apply to wholesale distributors of prescription drugs in any State (see proposed \u00a7 205.1). The standards, terms, and conditions for licensure established under part 205, subparts A and C, once finalized, would apply to all State and Federal 3PL and wholesale distributor licenses. All 3PL facilities are required to obtain a 3PL license for each facility of such 3PL. The FD&C Act, as amended by DSCSA, prohibits States from regulating 3PLs as wholesale distributors. A 3PL that also engages in wholesale distribution in the same facility in which it engages in 3PL activities must obtain a separate wholesale distribution license (see proposed \u00a7 205.1). An entity is considered a wholesale distributor if the entity is engaged in the distribution of a drug subject to section 503(b) (relating to prescription drugs) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 353(b)), to a person other than a consumer or patient, with a few exclusions. Under section 201(g) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(g)), a drug includes a bulk drug substance, and under current FDA regulations, the term bulk drug substance means any substance that is represented for use in a drug and that, when used in the manufacturing, processing, or packaging of a drug, becomes an active ingredient or a finished dosage form of the drug. The term does not include intermediates used in the synthesis of such substances (21 CFR 203.3(e)). FDA believes that the distribution of bulk drug substances must have the same safeguards and provisions as the distribution of finished drug products. The same safeguards that prevent diversion and theft and secure the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain generally must include the transfer of bulk drug substances, as they are subject to the same concerns as the distribution of prescription drugs in finished dosage form. FDA is proposing to establish the process and standards that would apply to any third-party accreditation or inspection services seeking to obtain or maintain approval by FDA to evaluate qualifications of 3PLs for licensure or to conduct inspections of wholesale distributors (see proposed \u00a7 205.1). Once finalized, proposed subparts B and D of part 205 would establish the process and standards for third-party accreditation and inspection services to become approved by the Secretary to review the qualifications of 3PLs for licensure, as required by section 584(d) of the FD&C Act, and to conduct inspections of wholesale distributors, as permitted by section 583(c) of the FD&C Act (see proposed \u00a7 205.2) ( to become ''approved organizations''). B. Definitions (Proposed \u00a7 205.3) By its terms, the definitions of terms in section 581 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360eee) applies in subchapter H. However, because those terms are also used throughout section 503(e) of the FD&C Act (as amended by the DSCSA), FDA considers the definitions and interpretations contained in section 581 of the FD&C Act to apply to those terms when used in proposed part 205. Specifically, the definitions of the following terms contained in section 581 of the FD&C Act apply when used in proposed part 205: Affiliate, authorized, dispenser, illegitimate product, licensed, manufacturer, product, repackager, return, specific patient need, suspect product, third- party logistics provider, and wholesale distributor. In addition, FDA is proposing the definition of the following additional terms to help clarify the requirements. FDA believes that these proposed definitions align with existing law and regulations, as well as current industry practices. 3PL Activities: Includes warehousing and ''other logistics services'' that are undertaken with respect to a product (as defined in proposed \u00a7 205.3(k)). Change of Entity Ownership: Recognizing that businesses often undergo changes in corporate structure through mergers, acquisitions, and other transactions, FDA proposes that ''change of entity ownership'' be defined to help ensure consistency with regard to how such changes will affect licensure. The definition describes the events that would constitute a change in ownership with respect to a partnership, unincorporated sole proprietorship, corporation, or limited liability company. Co-Licensed Partner: One of two or more entities that have entered into an agreement for the right to engage in the marketing of a prescription drug. The Agency believes this definition is in alignment with industry practice and existing laws. Designated Representative: An individual who is designated as the representative of the facility manager and, as such, is identified by the licensee as responsible for managing the daily operation of the establishment in compliance with licensure requirements and has the authority to implement corrective action when necessary. This individual is also responsible for ensuring that personnel are appropriately qualified, assigned, and VerDate Sep<11>2014 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 24 / Friday, February 4, 2022 / Proposed Rules trained to accomplish their duties. The Agency believes this definition reflects current practices and understanding. Entity or Entities: A business organization, such as a corporation, company, association, firm, partnership, society, sole proprietorship, or joint stock company. Facility: A site at one general, permanent, physical location used to store or handle prescription drugs. For purposes of proposed part 205, a facility does not include a site, such as a corporate office or headquarters, where the sole activity conducted at the site is one of oversight, support, or business administrative function. Key Personnel: Any individual who has responsibility for managing the operations of the wholesale distributor, including any principal, owner, director, officer of the wholesale distributor, designated representatives, and other individuals who are authorized to enter areas where prescription drugs are held and are likely to handle those prescription drugs as a part their responsibilities within the operation. \u00c6Section 583(b)(5) of the FD&C Act, as amended by DSCSA, requires that FDA establish standards for the ''establishment and implementation of qualifications for key personnel'' of wholesale distributors. These key personnel must be sufficiently qualified and screened to carry out the important responsibilities that come with positions within a wholesale distribution company. FDA believes individuals who hold these positions must be held to a high standard of qualification as they are entrusted with important aspects of protecting the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Minimal Quantities: An annual dollar volume of prescription drugs sold by a retail pharmacy to licensed practitioners for office use that does not exceed 5 percent of the total dollar volume of that retail pharmacy's annual prescription sales. \u00c6Section 503(e)(4) of the FD&C Act excludes a number of activities from the definition of wholesale distribution. One excluded category, listed at section 503(e)(4)(E) of the FD&C Act, is ''the distribution of minimal quantities of a drug by a licensed retail pharmacy to a licensed practitioner for office use.'' FDA has previously considered what constitutes minimal quantities in determining when the practices of a retail pharmacy become wholesale drug distribution and thereby subject to licensure (see 64 FR 67720, December 3, 1999). For example, in preamble discussions around codifying provisions related to wholesale distribution, FDA proposed a minimal quantities limit, considered comments, and ultimately concluded that sales of prescription drugs by a retail pharmacy to licensed practitioners for office use would be considered to be minimal and not wholesale distribution, if the total dollar volume of these sales does not exceed 5 percent of the total dollar volume of that retail pharmacy's annual prescription sales. \u00c6The Agency continues to maintain its position that a 5-percent limit to what constitutes minimal quantities is sufficient ''to meet the needs of licensed practitioners who may not purchase enough prescription drugs to go through a wholesale distributor and thus may not otherwise be able to easily obtain drugs for office use'' (64 FR 67720 at 67748). We believe this standard is still relevant and is the industry standard. We note that in January 2013, the NABP passed a resolution that supports limiting the five percent rule to allow for transfer ''between pharmacies, or from pharmacy to or from pharmacies to practitioners, only for the purpose of dispensing or administration, but not for resale; and to prohibit the transfer, distribution, or sale of prescription drugs from pharmacies to wholesalers for resale'' (Ref 17). The transfer or sale from dispenser to dispenser for a specific patient need is already considered to not be wholesale distribution under the FD&C Act (see section 503(e)(4)). This NABP resolution accords with FDA's proposed definition of minimal quantities. We request comment on the codification of this 5 percent limit for office use and of the definition of minimal quantities. \u00c6Accordingly, a licensed retail pharmacy that distributes more than 5 percent of its annual sales to licensed practitioners is engaging in wholesale distribution, subject to all the requirements for wholesale distributors, unless its activities are otherwise excluded from the definition of wholesale distribution. The exemption for distributing minimal quantities of drugs by retail pharmacies to licensed practitioners for office use was ''not created to confer a special benefit on retail pharmacies, but to meet the legitimate need of licensed practitioners'' (64 FR 67720 at 67748). For purposes of section 503(e)(4)(E) of the FD&C Act, FDA is proposing to codify its position on ''minimal quantities'' in the proposed \u00a7 205.3(h) to mean the ''total annual dollar amount sold to licensed practitioners for office use does not exceed 5 percent of the total dollar volume of that retail pharmacy's annual prescription drug sales.'' \u00c6The Agency also notes that this exclusion only applies to sales of prescription drugs from licensed pharmacies to licensed practitioners for office use. FDA understands that some States and other entities have expanded the applicability of this exclusion from the definition of wholesale distribution to allow for distribution from pharmacies to other entities outside of licensed practitioners for office use, but FDA notes that this practice is not allowed under current Federal law. The statutory language at section 503(e)(4)(E) of the FD&C Act specifically limits the exclusion to the distribution of minimal quantities of a drug between a licensed retail pharmacy and a licensed practitioner for office use. Unless a specific sale or transfer of a drug from one dispenser to another dispenser is outside of the definition of wholesale distribution because it is to a consumer or patient ( e.g., to fulfill a ''specific patient need,'' as defined at section 581(19) of the FD&C Act), a pharmacy that sells or trades prescription drugs to other pharmacies or other entities falls within the definition of wholesale distribution. Such activity is considered wholesale distribution under section 503(e)(4) of the FD&C Act, subject to all the requirements of wholesale distributors. Other Logistics Services: Services provided by entities that accept or transfer direct possession of products from that entity's facility within the United States and its territories on behalf of a trading partner ( e.g., manufacturer, wholesale distributor, dispenser), but that do not take ownership of the product or have the responsibility to direct a product's sale or disposition. It also includes services undertaken with respect to a product for a repackager that is acting on behalf of a manufacturer, wholesale distributor, or dispenser. \u00c6Under the DSCSA, the definition of 3PL includes entities that conduct ''other logistics services'' on behalf of a manufacturer, wholesale distributor, or dispenser of a product. The Agency recognizes that 3PLs may perform 3PL activities for repackagers and proposes to include in the definition of ''other logistics services'' those services undertaken with respect to a product for a repackager acting on behalf of a manufacturer, wholesale distributor, or dispenser. \u00c6Under this proposed definition, a common carrier that only transports a product, but does not take ownership of the product, is not conducting ''other logistic services.'' Similarly, Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 24 / Friday, February 4, 2022 / Proposed Rules that directs the sale or disposition of the product but does not take possession (such as a broker) would not be conducting ''other logistics services'' and does not meet the definition of a 3PL, but may be engaged in activities that meet the definition of a manufacturer or wholesale distributor. Other Than a Consumer or Patient: A person receiving the drug who is not (i) the individual identified as the recipient of the prescription drug, (ii) a dispenser fulfilling a specific patient need, or (iii) the clinical investigator, as defined in 21 CFR 312.3(b) (or any successor regulation). \u00c6FDA considers certain types of prescription drug distribution as outside the scope of ''wholesale distribution'' under section 503(e)(4) of the FD&C Act because they constitute ''the distribution of a drug'' to a ''consumer or patient,'' which is excluded from the definition of wholesale distribution. The first of these is the distribution to, or receipt by, the patient, who, for purposes of DSCSA, FDA considers to be the individual intended to take or be administered the prescription drug. This would typically be the individual whose name appears on the prescription. \u00c6FDA also considers the transfer or sale of a drug from one dispenser to another to fulfill a ''specific patient need'' to be outside the scope of wholesale distribution. Specific patient need is defined at section 581(19) of the FD&C Act as ''the transfer of a product from one pharmacy to another to fill a prescription for an identified patient.'' FDA would note, however, that a dispenser who transfers or sells a drug to a trading partner other than another dispenser, or to another dispenser where there is no specific patient need evidenced by a prescription, is distributing a drug to someone other than a consumer or patient, which, if not otherwise excluded under section 503(e)(4) of the FD&C Act, would be engaging in wholesale drug distribution requiring a wholesale distributor license. \u00c6Finally, FDA considers the sale or transfer of a drug for investigational or research purposes to an investigator, as defined in 21 CFR 312.3 (or any successor regulation), under an investigational new drug application (IND) submitted to FDA to be outside the scope of wholesale distribution because the drug is used for in vitro, clinical, or other research purposes under an IND. \u00c6For these reasons, FDA is proposing to exclude these types of transactions from the scope of wholesale distribution. Product: A prescription drug in a finished dosage form that is ready for administration to a patient without substantial further manufacturing ( e.g., capsules, tablets, lyophilized products before reconstitution). \u00c6The definition of ''product'' proposed here is broader and more inclusive than that used for purposes of product tracing detailed in section 582 of the FD&C Act as defined in section 581(13). As used in section 584 of the FD&C Act for purposes of licensure of a 3PL, the term ''product'' excludes active pharmaceutical ingredients intended for incorporation into a finished drug product but have yet to undergo substantial further manufacturing to become the finished dosage form for administration. Of note, for purposes of section 582 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360eee-1), the definition for ''product'' excludes certain types of prescription drugs in finished dosage form (section 581(13) of the FD&C Act). Significant Disciplinary Action: Any action by a State or Federal licensing authority that would limit or prevent a 3PL from conducting 3PL activities, or would limit or prevent a wholesale distributor from distributing or facilitating the distribution of prescription drugs. This includes suspension or revocation of a 3PL or wholesale distributor license, State controlled substances license, or Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registration, and potentially includes other disciplinary actions such as a consent decree or final ruling of a State licensure board, depending on the impact on the 3PL's or wholesale distributor's legal ability to perform licensed activities. Unfit for Distribution: A prescription drug that has been identified as a drug whose sale would violate the FD&C Act. This definition includes prescription drugs identified as suspect or illegitimate (582(c)(4) of the FD&C Act); adulterated, including drugs rendered nonsaleable because conditions (such as return, recall, damage, or expiry) cast doubt on the drug's safety, identity, strength, quality, or purity (section 501 of the FD&C Act); or misbranded (section 502 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 352)). \u00c6FDA believes that prescription drugs unfit for distribution must be segregated from those that are fit for distribution to protect patients from receiving potentially defective or harmful prescription drugs and prevent the distribution of drugs that are unfit for distribution. \u00c6A wholesale distributor or 3PL could potentially identify a prescription drug as unfit for distribution through their own examination of incoming and outgoing shipments of prescription drugs as outlined by proposed 21 CFR 205.12(c)(1) for 3PLs and 205.26(c)(4) for wholesale distributors, through inventory review under proposed 21 CFR 205.12(c)(4)(i) for 3PLs and 205.26(c)(5)(i)(B) for wholesale distributors, through other internal means designed to detect product that is unfit for distribution, or be notified of a prescription drug's status as unfit for distribution by a trading partner or others. Wholesale distribution: \u00c6Section 503(e)(4) of the FD&C Act defines wholesale distribution as ''the distribution of a drug subject to [section 503(b) of the FD&C Act] to a person other than a consumer or patient, or receipt of a drug subject to [section 503(b) of the FD&C Act] by a person other than the consumer or patient.'' The definition then goes on to list 19 activities that are not considered wholesale distribution. Of these, FDA is providing clarification about several that may be causing some confusion for industry and the States. \u00c6Section 503(e)(4)(C) of the FD&C Act states that the distribution of a drug or an offer to distribute a drug for emergency medical reasons, including a public health emergency declaration pursuant to section 319 of the Public Health Service Act, does not constitute wholesale distribution. In addition to distribution of a drug during a declared public health emergency pursuant to section 319 of the Public Health Service Act, FDA considers the following circumstances to constitute emergency medical reasons and therefore be excluded from the definition of wholesale distribution: (1) The distribution of a drug to a first responder or other authorized individual administering prescription drugs to acutely ill or injured persons in an emergency situation and outside a healthcare facility, and (2) a long-term care facility receiving an emergency kit containing drugs for use in emergency situations to treat acutely ill or injured persons during hours of the day when necessary drugs cannot be obtained from a dispenser. Pursuant to 503(e)(4)(C) of the FD&C Act, this exclusion from the definition of wholesale distribution does not include distributing a drug during a shortage unless such shortage was caused by a public health emergency. \u00c6The exclusion at section 503(e)(4)(E) of the FD&C Act for the distribution of minimal quantities of prescription drugs by a licensed retail pharmacy to a licensed practitioner for VerDate Sep<11>2014 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 24 / Friday, February 4, 2022 / Proposed Rules office use is discussed in the description of the term ''minimal quantities.'' \u00c6Section 503(e)(4)(H) of the FD&C Act excludes ''the distribution of a drug by the manufacturer of such drug'' from wholesale distribution. Therefore, FDA considers the activities of a manufacturer, as defined at section 581(10) of the FD&C Act, when distributing its own drug, as excluded from the definition of wholesale distribution and not subject to the requirements that apply to wholesale distributors. FDA believes this is supported by the term ''wholesale distributor,'' which is defined at section 581(29) of the FD&C Act, in relevant part, as ''a person (other than a manufacturer, a manufacturer's co- licensed partner . . .) engaged in wholesale distribution.'' The Agency notes, however, that if Manufacturer A purchases and distributes Manufacturer B's drug, for which Manufacturer A has no affiliation and is not a co-licensed partner, Manufacturer A is engaged in wholesale distribution, subject to all the requirements for wholesale distributors. C. National Standards for Third-Party Logistics Providers 1. 3PL Licensure 3PL facilities are required to be licensed in order to conduct activities in any State (section 584 of the FD&C Act). As such, the proposed regulation provides that a 3PL facility may not conduct 3PL activities unless it is licensed by the State from which it conducts 3PL activities, or by FDA if the State from which 3PL activities are conducted has not established a licensure program in accordance with the regulations, as set forth in section 584(a) of the FD&C Act (see proposed \u00a7 205.4(a)). In addition, the requirement in 584(a) of the FD&C Act that each facility of the 3PL must be licensed, such that a 3PL with multiple facilities in a single State will have multiple licenses from that State, is set forth in proposed \u00a7 205.4(b). Under FDA's proposed regulation, if a 3PL owns or leases a facility serving as a warehouse for products, the State in which the facility is located will be considered the State from which the 3PL ''conducts activities'' and will be the State from which the 3PL must obtain a license for that facility under proposed \u00a7 205.4(a)(1). FDA understands there has been some confusion about whether an entity hired or contracted by another trading partner to provide labor, logistic, or administrative services for that trading partner in that trading partner's facility would be considered a 3PL. This could occur, for example, where a wholesale distributor hires a contractor to provide such support services from within the wholesale distributor's facility exclusively for that wholesale distributor. In this scenario, the contractor's activities from within the wholesale distributor's licensed facility would be captured by the wholesale distributor's license and obligations for compliance, and the facility would not be considered a 3PL or required to have a 3PL license. However, an entity that operates a facility in which it engages in wholesale distribution and performs 3PL activities on behalf of other trading partners for products it does not own or direct the sale or disposition of is required to obtain both a wholesale distributor and 3PL license for that facility. Additionally, pursuant to section 584(a)(2) of the FD&C Act, if a product is distributed in interstate commerce, the 3PL must be licensed by the State into which the product is distributed if that State requires such license; however, section 584(a)(2) of the FD&C Act also provides that if the 3PL is licensed by FDA, as described in section 584(a)(1)(B), the 3PL is not required to obtain a license from the State into which the product is distributed (see proposed \u00a7 205.4(a)(3)). Finally, to ensure that a facility and those responsible for its operations meet the licensing standards, FDA proposes to require that 3PL licenses be facility- and owner-specific and not transferable to another establishment or owner (see proposed \u00a7 205.4(c)). 3PL licenses must be held at the licensed facility and must be made available to State, Federal, or other licensing authorities upon request (see proposed \u00a7 205.4(d)). Section 584 states that the national licensing standards for 3PLs established by regulation take effect 1 year after the date such final regulation is published (section 584(d)(1) and (3) of the FD&C Act). National licensing standards for wholesale distributors established by regulation take effect 2 years after the date such final regulation is published (section 583(a) and (e)(3) of the FD&C Act). For several reasons, including those discussed below, FDA does not intend to enforce the licensing requirements for 3PLs until 2 years after the final regulation is published. FDA recognizes that 1 year may be insufficient time for States to implement 3PL licensure programs, should they decide to implement such a program, and for 3PLs to apply for licensure under these programs. Setting up a state licensure program may require additional time. This is especially true in States that will require State legislative action to implement a licensure program, with some State legislatures only meeting biennially. Considering these factors, FDA does not intend to enforce these requirements with respect to the national standards for licensure until 2 years after the regulation is finalized. This will help ensure there is time for States to establish or modify their licensure programs in accordance with the new standards and time for 3PLs to apply and obtain a new license. For 1 year after the effective date of the final regulation, FDA also does not intend to enforce the requirements of section 582(b)(3), (c)(3), (d)(3), and (e)(3) of the FD&C Act with respect to a manufacturer, wholesale distributor, dispenser, or repackager who has as a trading partner a 3PL that is not licensed, unless the 3PL is not licensed because the Secretary or a state licensing body has made a finding that the 3PL does not utilize good handling and distribution practices and has published notice thereof. 2. General Application Requirements for Licensure The general requirements that must be met for a State or Federal licensing authority to issue a license to a 3PL facility are proposed in \u00a7 205.5. As proposed, \u00a7 205.5(a) includes requirements applicable to the individual who submits the application and states that the applicant must submit all required information and pay any applicable licensing fee to be issued a license. The information that would be required as part of a 3PL's application for licensure of a facility is set forth in proposed \u00a7 205.5(b). FDA believes this information is necessary for the licensing authority to assess whether the 3PL is in good standing and has the infrastructure and capabilities to fulfill its duties and obligations under these national standards for 3PL licensure. This includes disclosing whether the 3PL facility manager or designated representative has ever been convicted of a felony relating to prescription drug distribution (see proposed \u00a7 205.5(b)(7)). FDA believes that this information is crucial to protect the integrity of the prescription drug supply chain by ensuring that those responsible for the daily operations of a 3PL facility do not have a history of violating the FD&C Act. In addition, in its application for licensure renewal, under proposed \u00a7 205.7, a 3PL would be required to certify that the 3PL facility has continually met the requirements of \u00a7 205.5 and will inform the licensing authority of certain to VerDate Sep<11>2014 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 24 / Friday, February 4, 2022 / Proposed Rules information if such changes have not already been submitted to the licensing authority (see proposed \u00a7 205.5(c)). 3. The Federal Licensure Process Section 584(a)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act gives FDA the authority to license 3PLs directly if the State from which a 3PL conducts 3PL activities has not established a licensure requirement in accordance with the regulations. The process that FDA will use for issuing licenses to 3PLs is detailed in proposed \u00a7 205.6. While \u00a7 205.6 is only applicable to 3PLs obtaining a license from FDA, FDA suggests that States implement similar procedures. FDA intends to help stakeholders understand who the appropriate licensing authority is in the 3PL's State. The FDA licensure process begins when a 3PL seeking licensure for a facility submits an application to FDA for review and consideration (see proposed \u00a7 205.6(a)). The DSCSA permits FDA to approve third-party organizations, referred to as approved organizations or AOs, to evaluate a 3PL's qualifications for licensure (section 584(d)(2)(A)-(B) and 584(e) of the FD&C Act). If FDA has approved one or more organizations to review a 3PL's qualifications for licensure, a 3PL should note the AO it prefers on its application. FDA generally intends to review a 3PL's qualifications for licensure only if the review cannot be completed by an FDA-approved AO. The licensure review consists of a review of all documents submitted in support of the application and an inspection of the facility pursuant to proposed \u00a7 205.16. FDA intends for the licensure application process to be electronic (see proposed \u00a7 205.6(a)) and to leverage existing technologies to streamline the licensure process. While the DSCSA permits AOs to review a 3PL's qualifications for licensure and to recommend to FDA whether a 3PL should be licensed, the responsibility for determining whether a 3PL meets all applicable requirements and to issue the license remains with FDA (see proposed \u00a7 205.6(b)). So as not to delay the licensure process, when reviewing an application, FDA intends to work with 3PLs to correct minor errors made on the application and communicate with the 3PL about additional information the Agency may need (see proposed \u00a7 205.6(c)). When FDA determines that a 3PL facility meets the applicable requirements and that none of the prohibited factors listed in proposed \u00a7 205.9(a)(1) are present, FDA will send the applicant an approval letter and a licensing certificate, effective on the date it is issued (see proposed \u00a7 205.6(d)). FDA recognizes that a 3PL may have concerns about what happens to the status of its license if the AO that reviewed its qualifications for licensure has disciplinary sanctions taken against it that affect its approval status or if it is otherwise no longer considered an approved AO. While a 3PL facility should not be penalized for the actions of the AO that reviews its qualifications for licensure, FDA must ensure that the AO's review and findings provide a reliable basis for licensing decisions. As such, FDA is proposing that the approval status of the AO that performed the licensure review for a 3PL facility will not automatically affect the licensure of a licensed 3PL facility that is otherwise in good standing (see proposed \u00a7 205.6(e)). Rather, in the event that an AO has disciplinary sanctions taken against it, ends its business, or is otherwise no longer considered an approved AO, the license of any 3PL facility reviewed by that AO will be subject to appropriate action in accordance with \u00a7 205.9 and other applicable statutes or regulations. FDA may verify the 3PL's compliance status and review the facts in that situation to determine the potential effect, if any, on the licensure of 3PL facilities reviewed by that AO. FDA intends to publish additional guidance regarding the process and procedures related to obtaining and maintaining a 3PL license issued by FDA. 4. Changes to Information, Location, or Ownership of a Licensed 3PL For the licensing authority to effectively carry out its responsibilities, a 3PL must keep its license information current and report any changes in information, including those that may significantly affect operations such as changes in location or ownership, to the licensing authority. Presently, the reporting requirements for these types of changes vary by State. FDA is proposing in \u00a7 205.7 that changes to certain information, including, for example, any changes in information submitted as part of an application for licensure, be submitted electronically to the licensing authority within 30 calendar days of the change (see proposed \u00a7 205.7(a)). Additionally, because a license is facility- and-owner specific (see proposed \u00a7 205.4(c)), the Agency is proposing that changes in the location or the ownership of a facility will require a new license (see proposed \u00a7 205.7(b) and (c)). 5. Expiration and Renewal of Licenses The DSCSA requires that the regulations establishing national standards for 3PLs provide that a 3PL license expires 3 years after the date of issuance, with the option for renewal for additional 3-year periods (section 584(d)(2)(H) of the FD&C Act). FDA is proposing to implement this requirement under proposed \u00a7 205.8 by saying that all 3PL licenses, whether newly issued or renewed by the licensing authority, expire 3 years from the date of issuance or renewal. FDA also proposes that 3PLs may not submit renewal applications more than 90 days prior to the license's date of expiration to ensure that licenses are renewed based on current information. While we do not anticipate lengthy administrative delays by the licensing authority, if a 3PL files an application for a license renewal within the appropriate time period and there is an administrative delay reviewing the license application that causes the 3PL license to lapse, the 3PL will not be penalized for that administrative delay. In this scenario, the 3PL's license will be considered valid during the period of the administrative delay (see proposed \u00a7 205.8). The Agency understands that at the time a final rule covering these proposed national standards goes into effect, there are likely to be 3PLs with existing licenses under State law. Nevertheless, 3PLs with existing State licenses must obtain new licenses in accordance with section 584(a) of the FD&C Act. These national licensing standards serve an important function of ensuring consistency across the domestic market. However, as described above, FDA does not intend to enforce the requirements with respect to the national standards for licensure of 3PLs until 2 years after the regulation is finalized. FDA's proposed requirements are further detailed in proposed \u00a7 205.16, which discusses the required inspections prior to licensure. 6. Licensure Denial, Suspension, Reinstatement, and Revocation\u2014Notice and Opportunity To Request a Hearing The standards for licensure denial are set forth in proposed \u00a7 205.9. Proposed \u00a7 205.9(a)(1) enumerates 9 circumstances under which the licensing authority would be required to deny a 3PL's request for licensure or license renewal. FDA believes that this list will help 3PLs focus on good storage practices outlined by FDA that are necessary to protect the integrity of the products in the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. To avoid VerDate Sep<11>2014 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 24 / Friday, February 4, 2022 / Proposed Rules denial or delays of their applications, 3PLs should ensure that they address the reasons for denial of a license outlined in proposed \u00a7 205.9(a)(1) when they file for licensure. Proposed \u00a7 205.9(a)(2) details the process afforded to 3PLs whose applications for licensure have been denied. FDA is proposing to provide applicants with the opportunity to provide additional information for reconsideration of the denial. If the licensing authority denies a 3PL's request for licensure after reconsideration, the 3PL will receive a notice of opportunity to request a hearing under existing FDA hearing procedures. FDA requests comment regarding the reconsideration and appeal process outlined in this regulation for 3PLs whose applications for licensure have been denied. The proposed standards for suspending a 3PL license are set forth in \u00a7 205.9(b) and (c) and are based on the severity of risk posed to the public health. Under most circumstances, we anticipate that a 3PL would have the opportunity for a hearing before licensure suspension. However, under certain circumstances that involve repeated conduct detrimental to the public health or refusal to correct significant issues that could lead to the dissemination of illegitimate product, the Agency may suspend a license immediately while giving the 3PL an opportunity to request a hearing. Under proposed \u00a7 205.9(b), a 3PL's license may also be suspended after the 3PL receives a notice of opportunity to request a hearing. A suspended 3PL must cease all 3PL activities until their license is re- instated. This provision applies when the licensing authority has a reasonable belief that the 3PL is not in compliance with licensure requirements. FDA is proposing for \u00a7 205.9(b) to require the licensing authority to notify the 3PL in writing of the intent to suspend its license. A 3PL will have 30 days from the date listed on the notice of intent to suspend a license to provide additional information to the licensing authority so it may reconsider its decision. If reconsideration is not sought or is denied, the licensing authority will inform the 3PL in writing of its formal intent to proceed with license suspension. The notice will contain a statement informing the 3PL that it can request a hearing on the question of whether there are sufficient grounds for suspension. The 3PL will have 10 days from the date on the notice to inform the licensing authority of its intent to request a hearing; otherwise the opportunity for a hearing will be waived and the license suspended. FDA believes this process will afford 3PLs a sufficient opportunity to present information and attempt to remedy noncompliance issues which may threaten the safety of products in the supply chain. FDA requests comment regarding this reconsideration and appeal process. Proposed \u00a7 205.9(c) allows for license suspension prior to opportunity for hearing and effective immediately if the 3PL's noncompliance poses an imminent threat to public safety. For example, if a 3PL is warehousing or shipping illegitimate product, and once made aware, corrective actions to protect the public health from the threat of these products are not taken, the 3PL's license could be suspended immediately. Another example could be a scenario where the conditions under which drugs are held or warehoused cause the product to be illegitimate and the 3PL refuses to correct the conditions or continues to ship these illegitimate products. Under the proposed regulation, in such a situation, the licensing authority will inform the 3PL in writing that its license is suspended. The notice will also contain a statement informing the 3PL that it may request a hearing and that a hearing, if granted, will be afforded within 10 days upon the receipt of the 3PL's request for hearing. The 3PL has 10 days from the date on the notice of suspension to request a hearing; otherwise its opportunity for a hearing will be waived. FDA believes that this limits the amount of time a 3PL license would be suspended while providing a reasonable amount of time both for the 3PL to review the notice of suspension and collect the necessary information to demonstrate that its license should not be suspended, and for FDA to consider a request for a hearing and to schedule and prepare for a hearing, if the hearing request is granted. FDA believes immediate suspension of a 3PL license is crucial in cases where continued operation of the 3PL presents an imminent threat to public safety and the pharmaceutical supply chain. Under proposed \u00a7 205.9(d), a 3PL's suspended license may be reinstated if the 3PL can demonstrate to the licensing authority that it is in compliance with regulation requirements. Under the proposed rule, the process outlined at 21 CFR 10.75 is the default for appeals regarding a denied application for a 3PL license, and the hearing process outlined at 21 CFR part 16 is the default for appeals regarding a suspended or revoked 3PL license. However, the 3PL may request any of the procedures in 21 CFR parts 10 through 16. FDA believes that this proposed approach is consistent with current practice and suggests that States develop comparable processes. The standards for revoking a 3PL license are set forth in proposed \u00a7 205.9(e). The licensing authority will revoke a license if it finds that a 3PL whose license has been suspended is unable or refuses to comply with the licensing requirements. The requirements governing the revocation of a 3PL license are set forth in proposed \u00a7 205.9(e)(2) through (5) and mirror those outlined in \u00a7 205.9(b)(2) through (7) for licensure suspension, with one exception: When the licensing authority informs the 3PL of its intent to revoke a license, the 3PL is given no opportunity for reconsideration since it already had an opportunity to rectify deficiencies while its license was suspended. In addition, where a 3PL fails to timely renew its application, the license will be considered expired and a 3PL will need to submit an application for new licensure because the licensing authority may be unable to confirm that the 3PL continues to meet all necessary licensure requirements (see proposed \u00a7 205.9(f)). FDA is also proposing to terminate a 3PL's license upon request from the 3PL when the request includes a notice of the 3PL's intent to discontinue its activities and a waiver of an opportunity for a hearing. The 3PL will be required to apply for a new license should it decide to resume 3PL activities (see proposed \u00a7 205.9(g)). 7. Good Storage Practices for 3PL Facilities The DSCSA charges FDA with creating national standards for the licensure of 3PL facilities, including the requirement that 3PLs comply with storage practices as determined by the Secretary (see section 584(d)(2)(C) of the FD&C Act). Those requirements are detailed in proposed \u00a7 205.10. FDA considers the requirement that ''each facility of such [3PL]'' be licensed ''in accordance with the regulations'' (section 584(a) of the FD&C Act) to mean that 3PLs without a facility are not required to be licensed. Section 584 of the FD&C Act provides that FDA will establish licensure standards that include requirements relating to storage of product. These standards address issues regarding access and maintenance that presuppose the existence of a physical facility where product is maintained. As such, the requirements apply to each 3PL facility that is owned, rented, or leased by the 3PL. If the 3PL shares the same name and location as another trading partner VerDate Sep<11>2014 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 24 / Friday, February 4, 2022 / Proposed Rules (for example, a wholesale distributor), each entity must be separately licensed and must have separate systems and processes in place for their separate functions (see proposed \u00a7 205.10(b)). The requirements for 3PL facilities regarding how products will be stored and adequate security maintained are set forth in proposed \u00a7 205.10(c). This provision includes requirements for storage of nonsaleable products within the 3PL facility. If the facility is in possession of a suspect product, the facility must have clearly defined areas in which to quarantine the suspect product until the product is dispositioned (section 584(d)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act). FDA is also proposing to require that 3PLs keep illegitimate product and other products unfit for distribution in a clearly defined and designated area, separate from saleable products, until dispositioned so the illegitimate or otherwise unfit product is not inadvertently combined with saleable products (see proposed \u00a7 205.10(c)(2)). An illegitimate product poses as great a risk to public health, if not a greater risk, as a suspect product because a product is illegitimate when there is credible evidence shows that the product is counterfeit, diverted, stolen, intentionally adulterated such that the product would result in serious adverse health consequences or death to humans, is the subject of a fraudulent transaction, or appears otherwise unfit for distribution such that the product would be reasonably likely to result in serious adverse health consequences or death to humans (section 581(8) of the FD&C Act). As such, it is counter to public health to store products that are unfit for distribution alongside saleable product. Furthermore, it would be illogical to move suspect product that has been determined to be illegitimate out of quarantine and into another area to be potentially stored with saleable product. 8. Personnel Requirements Necessary for Good Storage Practices Ensuring that 3PL personnel are appropriately qualified is integral to establishing good storage practices (section 584(d)(2)(C) of the FD&C Act). For this reason, proposed \u00a7 205.10(b)(3) requires that a 3PL facility must be designed in such a manner that only personnel who possess appropriate and verifiable experience and training will have access to areas in which products are held. While not proposed to be required in part 205, FDA believes that a best practice in order to maintain the security of prescription drug products, would be for a 3PL to screen personnel who work in areas of its facility where prescription drug products are held for records of Federal or State criminal convictions relating to the possession, control, or distribution of prescription drugs. While also not proposed to be required in part 205, FDA believes it would be a best practice for a firm to request that employees state that they are not engaged in and will not engage in the illegal use of controlled substances while serving in their capacity within the 3PL. FDA also proposes requiring that 3PLs maintain and make available to the licensing authority certain information about their facilities' managers and designated representatives (see proposed \u00a7 205.11). Furthermore, FDA is establishing specific employee qualifications with respect to facility managers or designated representatives that are necessary to effect good storage practices (see proposed \u00a7 205.11(b)). Specifically, FDA is proposing to require that a facility manager or designated representative of the facility manager serve in either capacity for only one facility at any one time (see proposed \u00a7 205.11(b)(2)). FDA believes that a facility manager or designated representative of the facility manager must be accountable for all operations of a 3PL facility. That facility manager or designated representative must be present within the facility, and must be familiar with the day-to-day operations of that facility. FDA believes that the best way to ensure the accountability and familiarity required for compliance is for a designated representative or facility manager to serve only one facility at a time. This is to ensure that the facility manager or designated representative is actively engaged in managing the daily operations of the facility and that they remain aware of any non-compliance issues that may arise. To ensure the qualified designated representative can fulfill their obligations to manage and carry out daily operations, FDA proposes to require that a 3PL provide its designated representative with adequate authority and the necessary resources (see proposed \u00a7 205.11(c) and (d)). FDA believes that establishing these requirements will help ensure that the products handled by a 3PL are properly safeguarded to protect the supply chain and the public health. Section 584(d)(2)(E) and (F) of the FD&C Act requires mandatory background checks for facility managers or the designated representatives of facility managers to ensure that neither the 3PL's facility manager nor the designated representative has engaged in the prohibited behaviors outlined in proposed \u00a7 205.11(e). Additionally, FDA is outlining other activities which may lead to the denial of licensure in proposed \u00a7 205.11(f). They are not bars to licensure, but they are factors that may be considered by licensure authorities when reviewing an application for licensure to determine whether the 3PL has storage practices sufficient to maintain adequate security over the facility. FDA requests comment on this section of the regulation and the scenarios outlined therein. Requiring that individuals with significant authority over 3PL activities be subject to a criminal background check adds an additional layer of safety and security to the supply chain (see proposed \u00a7 205.11(g)). Theft of product by personnel who have direct access to areas where products are stored is a known problem across the healthcare industry; the background checks required by section 584(d)(2)(F) of the FD&C Act that FDA is proposing here are necessary precautions to prevent the potential theft, loss, or abuse of prescription drugs. FDA suggests an additional best practice for a 3PL to utilize when staffing their operation. This best practice, related to staff who work within a 3PL, is designed to ensure security within a 3PL. FDA recommends to 3PLs that the individuals who work within their operation and have access to prescription drugs should not have a record of criminal activity involving violations of the FD&C Act or other laws involving prescription drugs. When screening personnel who work in areas of a 3PL facility where products are held, including the facility manager or designated representative, FDA recommends that a 3PL consider whether such personnel have (1) engaged in a pattern of violating the requirements of section 584 of the FD&C Act that present a threat of serious adverse health consequences or death to humans; (2) been found to have committed or facilitated commission of any prohibited acts under the FD&C Act or violated or facilitated any violations of any of the regulations in this part or analogous provisions of the State licensing authority, as applicable; (3) been convicted of any violation of Federal, State, or local laws relating to drug samples, wholesale or retail drug distribution, distribution of controlled substances, or third-party logistics services; or (4) been convicted of any felony under Federal, State, or local laws involving or related to prescription drugs. FDA believes that 3PLs should consider an applicant's history of violations of the FD&C Act, Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 24 / Friday, February 4, 2022 / Proposed Rules laws involving prescription drugs, when making staffing decisions. 9. Required Written Policies and Procedures Section 584(d)(2)(C)(iii) of the FD&C Act enumerates certain types of written policies and procedures that FDA regulations must require, and tasks FDA with defining the content with more specificity. Those written policies and procedures are set out in proposed \u00a7 205.12. All 3PLs would be expected to establish, maintain, and follow the written policies and procedures set forth in these proposed subsections for each 3PL facility, to the extent that the requirements of those sections are relevant to the scope of their specific 3PL activities. Under the proposed regulation, all written policies and procedures will be made available to the licensing authority upon request, and the licensing authority will be permitted to have access to and copy records of the 3PL to ensure that the 3PL facility is following its written policies and procedures (see proposed \u00a7 205.12(a)). Written policies and procedures include those that are stored and maintained electronically. FDA is implementing the statutory requirements listed in section 584(d)(2)(C)(iii) of the FD&C Act through proposed \u00a7 205.12(c)(1) through (6). Under these requirements, 3PLs must maintain written policies and procedures to address a product's receipt, security, storage, inventory, shipment, and distribution. Proposed \u00a7 205.12(c)(1) through (6) details the specific elements that such written policies and procedures must contain. Such elements are necessary to maintain supply chain integrity and align with current industry practices to protect the integrity of the drugs that are distributed through the supply chain. To ensure good storage practices, FDA is also proposing to require that 3PLs establish written policies and procedures for handling not only expired product as required in section 584(d)(2)(C)(iii)(VI) of the FD&C Act, but also products that are unfit for distribution (see proposed \u00a7 205.12(f)). Furthermore, any drug unfit for distribution should be segregated and returned or destroyed to prevent its distribution to the patient (see proposed \u00a7 205.12(f)(1)). These requirements will ensure that drugs, the distribution of which would violate the FD&C Act and which may not be fit for consumption by American consumers for a variety of reasons, are not distributed into the supply chain. FDA believes that these proposed standards align with current industry practices. Similarly, to further ensure the safety and efficacy of drug products, FDA is proposing that 3PLs maintain written policies and procedures related to the storage, inventory, and disposition of both suspect and illegitimate products. In the case of a suspect product, the written policies and procedures must include the procedure for quarantine or destruction of the product if directed to do so by the product's manufacturer, wholesale distributor, dispenser, or an authorized government agency. In the instance of an illegitimate product, written policies and procedures must be in place to ensure that illegitimate product is appropriately dispositioned as directed by the respective manufacturer, wholesale distributor, dispenser, or authorized government agency. This may include segregation in a clearly defined, designated area from which the product may be dispositioned. FDA believes that these proposed standards align with current industry practices and will give 3PLs a clear roadmap for dealing with potentially difficult situations involving suspect and illegitimate product. Finally, FDA views it as a best practice for a 3PL to establish written policies and procedures to ensure that it only engages in 3PL activities on behalf of authorized trading partners with respect to a product. DSCSA requires that all other entities that accept or transfer direct possession or ownership in the supply chain are only permitted to do business with other authorized trading partners (section 582 of the FD&C Act). FDA believes that, to further ensure supply chain security and integrity, it is important that 3PLs also only do business with other authorized trading partners. 3PLs that engage in transactions with non-authorized trading partners may expose the supply chain to potentially harmful or substandard product. FDA notes that 3PLs are included in the wholesale distributor and third-party logistics provider reporting public database (available at https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ DrugSafety/DrugIntegrityandSupplyChainSecurity/DrugSupplyChainSecurityAct/ucm423749.htm ) which allows manufacturers, wholesale distributors, repackagers, and dispensers to determine if the 3PL is authorized. Similarly, 3PLs should include using the publicly available information regarding other trading partners in their written policies and procedures to ensure they are doing business with only authorized trading partners. 10. Recordkeeping and List of Trading Partners The maintenance, availability, and accuracy of the records made available for inspection under section 584(d)(2)(D) of the FD&C Act is critical to demonstrate that 3PLs are acting in compliance with relevant laws and regulations and to ensure their records can be relied upon to identify any potential risk to the public health. As such, FDA is proposing to require that all records be securely stored, with procedures in place to restrict access and protect record integrity, and that any alterations made to records be signed and dated while preserving the original information contained in the record (see proposed \u00a7 205.13(a)). These records can be stored and maintained electronically. These records maintenance requirements will allow for greater confidence in both the information that is preserved at the facility and the information potentially disseminated to other trading partners. FDA is proposing that all records must be retained for a minimum of 3 years, except for records related to suspect and illegitimate products, product quality complaints, and destroyed, returned, and recalled products, which each must be retained for a minimum of 6 years (see proposed \u00a7 205.13(b)). Such record retention is necessary not only to ensure 3PLs are complying with the FD&C Act, but also to ensure that there is consistency and continuity in the access to the information across the records required pursuant to sections 582, 583, and 584 of the FD&C Act. The DSCSA requires that, upon the licensing authority's request, 3PLs provide the licensing authority with a list of the trading partners (manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers) for which the 3PL conducts 3PL activities (section 584(d)(2)(G) of the FD&C Act). This requirement would be codified in proposed \u00a7 205.14 and would also include repackagers for which the 3PL provides services when those repackagers are acting on behalf of a manufacturer, wholesale distributor, or dispenser of a product, as explained in the definition of other logistics services at \u00a7 205.3(i). 11. Annual and Other Reporting to FDA Under DSCSA, 3PLs must report certain information to FDA to be considered an authorized trading partner (sections 581(2)(C) and 584(b) of the FD&C Act). The annual reporting requirements for 3PLs went into effect on November 27, 2014. Proposed \u00a7 205.15 clarifies Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 24 / Friday, February 4, 2022 / Proposed Rules prescribed annual reporting requirements and proposes the collection of additional information to provide complete and useful information about 3PLs that can be used by FDA, States, and trading partners. The DSCSA requires 3PLs to report to FDA for each facility: (1) The State by which the facility is licensed; (2) the facility's license number; (3) the facility's name and address; and (4) all trade names under which the facility conducts business (section 584(b) of the FD&C Act). If a facility conducts more than one type of activity, such as 3PL activities and wholesale distribution activities, the facility must be licensed as both a wholesale distributor and a 3PL and must report to FDA separately as a wholesale distributor and a 3PL (section 503(e)(2) of the FD&C Act). FDA is proposing to require that 3PLs use an electronic system provided by FDA for reporting (see proposed \u00a7 205.15(a)). This electronic system will increase efficiency by providing uniformity in the content and format of reports, thereby making the information easier to process. FDA is proposing that the annual reporting schedule require all 3PLs to report each calendar year between January 1st and March 31st, although an entity may update information at any time (see proposed \u00a7 205.15(b)). For example, if a 3PL chooses to update a license on December 15, 2019, that 3PL will still have to report during the January 1, 2020 through March 31, 2020 annual reporting period. The specific information that 3PLs must electronically report to FDA is set forth in proposed \u00a7 205.15(c). The DSCSA requires that 3PLs report the name and address of each facility (section 584(b)(2) of the FD&C Act). In fulfilling this requirement, the 3PL must provide the address that is associated with the State or Federal license. Licensed entities are also required to report to FDA the State by which they are licensed and the license number (section 584(b)(1) of the FD&C Act). In addition, FDA is proposing to require that the reported company name be identical to the official company name appearing on the license (see proposed \u00a7 205.15(c)(2)). Maintaining an account in FDA's electronic system for each 3PL facility license during the reporting period is integral to FDA's ability to provide oversight, as each facility of a 3PL must be licensed in order for the 3PL to conduct 3PL activities. In addition to the requirements specified in the statute, FDA is proposing to require an additional data element that FDA views as important to the Agency, the States, and trading partners. This additional information will inform other trading partners that the 3PL is in fact an authorized trading partner with whom they can do business. To this end, FDA is proposing to require that 3PLs provide the date each State license expires. This information is essential for determining that licensure status for each 3PL facility is current. Also, in addition to the physical address, which is required to be reported by statute, FDA believes that it would be a best practice for 3PLs to submit a unique facility identifier (UFI) that corresponds with the facility name and facility address. The UFI for a 3PL facility is useful to FDA when identifying and confirming certain business information. To be most helpful to FDA and other trading partners, a 3PL should obtain a separate UFI for each physical address that the 3PL is reporting since each 3PL facility must meet the 3PL requirements, and licensure is facility specific. FDA also believes that it would be a best practice for 3PLs to submit the contact information of an individual who will interact with FDA, including that individual's name, telephone number, and email address. FDA recommends as a best practice that the 3PL designate a contact person who is familiar with the daily operations of the 3PL facility, such as the designated representative, to ensure efficient processing of inquiries and minimize the impact inquiries may have on the daily operations of the facility. It is important for other trading partners and FDA to know whether a 3PL has had a license revoked or suspended or whether a 3PL has had any other significant disciplinary actions taken against them that limits the ability of a facility to conduct drug- related business. As such, 3PLs must report significant disciplinary actions to FDA. This will involve providing a DEA registration number or State controlled substance license number when there is a significant disciplinary action issued by the DEA or the State controlled substance licensing authority that would limit the ability of the 3PL facility to conduct 3PL activities related to the distribution of controlled drug substances that meet the definition of product, as defined at \u00a7 205.3(k). In such a situation, information about the DEA registration or State controlled substance license is important because the disciplinary action would likely be associated with that specific license or registration. A significant disciplinary action is defined in the proposed regulation as an action that limits the ability of a facility to conduct 3PL activities related to the distribution of prescription drug products. FDA proposes that, within 30 calendar days after a significant disciplinary action is imposed or taken by a State or Federal government, 3PLs must report the type of disciplinary action, the date the action was taken, and the State where the disciplinary action occurred, as well as submit any documents associated with the disciplinary action, including a final ruling by the relevant State or Federal agency or board or a consent decree. Finally, FDA is proposing to require a 3PL to report to FDA within 30 calendar days of ceasing warehousing or other logistics services that it is going out of business or voluntarily withdrawing a 3PL license from a State. FDA believes reporting this information is essential for the information in the public database to be complete, accurate, and useful for FDA, the States, and trading partners. To ensure efficient enforcement of FD&C Act requirements and to make public the voluntary information provided by each 3PL facility, FDA proposes adding 3PL licensure to the public database to make information about 3PLs available on FDA's website. Having the license status of 3PLs in one publicly available database will help FDA, trading partners, and other stakeholders determine whether 3PLs are properly licensed and authorized. 12. Inspection Provisions Section 584(d)(2)(D) of the FD&C Act requires that the regulations provide for periodic inspections of 3PL facilities to ensure compliance with the national standards and directs FDA to determine the intervals at which periodic inspections of a 3PL will be conducted by the licensing authority to ensure a facility's compliance with the law and this regulation. To this end, FDA is proposing to require that a physical inspection of a 3PL facility be conducted prior to issuance of the initial license and routinely once every 3 years thereafter (see proposed \u00a7 205.16(a) and (b)). The regulation proposes allowing the licensing authority, or an AO, as determined by the licensing authority, to conduct physical inspections (see proposed \u00a7 205.16(a)). As used in part 205, subparts A and B, licensing authority means the State licensing authority or FDA. When developing the timeframes for inspections, FDA sought to balance the risk to the supply chain while considering FDA's and State agencies' resource constraints. FDA is proposing to require that the physical inspection of a 3PL facility warehouse space include VerDate Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 24 / Friday, February 4, 2022 / Proposed Rules the paper and electronically stored records detailing the processes related to all 3PL activities (see proposed \u00a7 205.16(c)). FDA has authority to require that an inspection of a 3PL warehouse include the 3PL's records, files, and processes related to product warehousing. Section 704(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 374(a)(1)) states that . . . are held, inspection shall extend to all things therein (including records, files, papers, processes, controls, and facilities).'' This authority directly applies to FDA's ability to inspect a 3PL's facility warehouse space for relevant records and files to ensure compliance with the FD&C Act. FDA also proposes to require that 3PLs permit inspections at reasonable times and that the licensing authority conduct its inspection in a reasonable manner (see proposed \u00a7 205.16(c) and (d)). D. Approved Organizations for 3PLs 1. Approval and Utilization of Outside Organizations in the Licensure Process The DSCSA requires that regulations codified by FDA establish a process by which a third-party organization approved by FDA shall, upon a 3PL's request, ''issue a license'' to each 3PL facility that meets the requirements for licensure (section 584(d)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act). However, in situations where a State has not established a licensure program in accordance with the regulations, the DSCSA charges FDA with issuing 3PL licenses, provided the applicable requirements for licensure are met (section 584(a)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act). Accordingly, FDA interprets the language of 584(d)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act to mean that a third-party organization approved by FDA\u2014an AO\u2014will conduct a review of the 3PL's qualifications for licensure and issue a report to FDA regarding whether the 3PL ''demonstrates that all applicable requirements for licensure . . . are met,'' which FDA can rely on when issuing a license per section 584(e) of the FD&C Act. The DSCSA allows States and FDA to approve organizations for purposes of licensure review and periodic inspection. Proposed \u00a7\u00a7 205.17, 205.18, and 205.19 contain the process that FDA will use to approve organizations and the qualifications to become an AO. FDA suggests that States that choose to rely on AOs for licensure reviews have in place the same or similar processes for approved organizations to conduct licensure reviews and for decisions affecting the approval status of those organizations. The scope of work AOs would be tasked with performing and the standards an AO must meet to become approved are detailed in subpart B of proposed part 205. The proposed rules also set forth the process by which FDA will approve organizations to review the qualifications of 3PL facilities for licensure, which we refer to as a ''licensure review.'' A licensure review consists of performing a review of all documents submitted to the licensing authority in support of an application for 3PL licensure and conducting an inspection of the facility as directed by the licensing authority. If a review of documentation supports licensure of the 3PL facility, the facility will then be inspected by an AO, as directed by FDA. FDA is proposing that the AO's licensure review be completed within 90 days upon receiving notice from the Agency to conduct the licensure review. FDA believes that this 90-day timeframe is sufficient for an AO to perform the work with which they are tasked while also ensuring that there are no undue delays in the licensure process. Upon completion of the licensure review, the AO would then provide FDA with a licensure review report within 7 days (see proposed \u00a7 205.17(b)), with a copy sent to the 3PL facility. As proposed, using the report submitted by the AO, FDA would make the final determination as to whether a 3PL facility should be issued a license. The process that AOs should follow when conducting routine inspections of 3PL facilities mirrors the process for licensure review and is detailed in proposed \u00a7 205.17(c). It is important that FDA can verify an AO's continued compliance with the approval requirements. Therefore, to keep its approval, FDA is proposing to require that an AO maintain certain records for a period of at least 5 years and these records must be readily available to FDA upon request. Unless specified by statute, we believe it is reasonable for the required length of maintenance of records to align with the length of the entity's licensure term. In addition, to ensure public safety, FDA is proposing to require that AOs report potential violations at 3PL facilities to FDA within 24 hours of discovery (see proposed \u00a7 205.17(f)). The general qualifications for approval of AOs are set out in proposed \u00a7 205.18. To become and remain approved, FDA is proposing to require that an organization, and those employed by the organization, abide by certain requirements that are intended to secure against conflicts of interest, promote professional business practices, and protect non-public information (see proposed \u00a7 205.18(a)). FDA is proposing to allow AOs to hire outside contractors to conduct licensure reviews or licensure review-related activities. Under FDA's proposed regulation, AOs who decide to use outside contractors must ensure that the contractors not only effectively carry out the licensure review or licensure review-related activities in a manner consistent with this proposed regulation to ensure public health, but the AO must also ensure that the contractors properly protect all non-public information. For an AO to maintain approval, FDA proposes to require that the AO ensures contractors abide by all applicable confidentiality agreements, that the AOs have policies and procedures in place to ensure the contractors abide by these proposed standards, and that the contractors have the necessary training and expertise to carry out licensure reviews (see proposed \u00a7 205.18(b)(1)). Also, before a contractor hired by an AO may perform a licensure review of a 3PL facility, the 3PL must have entered into an agreement with the AO giving the AO permission to share with contractors the 3PL's confidential commercial information (see proposed \u00a7 205.18(b)(2)). If such consent is not provided by the 3PL facility, the AO must perform the licensure review itself. FDA believes that this approach is reasonable given that it is the AO's decision to work with contractors and, under this proposed regulation, the ultimate responsibility for the licensure review rests with the AO. In addition, so FDA may keep track of which organization is responsible for each licensure review, FDA proposes that AOs must submit to FDA a list of the contractors used by the organization each year and the AO must certify that such contractors comply with the applicable requirements (see proposed \u00a7 205.18(b)(3)). Finally, to ensure that the standards set forth in this regulation are followed and that lines of responsibility are clear, FDA proposes to require that the AOs remain responsible for all the work performed by outside contractors (see proposed \u00a7 205.18(b)). FDA proposes to prohibit contractors from subcontracting licensure review or licensure review-related activities (see proposed \u00a7 205.18(b)(1)(ii)). Limiting the ability of contractors to further delegate their responsibility ensures that FDA will have accurate information about who is conducting licensure reviews, that those responsible for the licensure reviews have necessary VerDate Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 24 / Friday, February 4, 2022 / Proposed Rules qualifications, and that their conduct is governed by this proposed regulation. The proposed process that FDA will use to approve organizations, including the application process, as well as the process for suspending or revoking an organization's approval, are set forth in proposed \u00a7 205.19. To ensure compliance with DSCSA, FDA is proposing that organizations seeking approval by FDA must first electronically submit to FDA an application demonstrating the organization's ability to assess compliance with all 3PL requirements detailed in proposed \u00a7 205.19 (see proposed \u00a7 205.19(a) and (b)). Organizations must also provide training that their employees must pass before they may conduct licensure reviews (see proposed \u00a7 205.19(c)). To verify information contained in the application and further ensure compliance with the proposed regulation, FDA proposes that, before an AO may conduct its first licensing review, it must be audited by FDA (see proposed \u00a7 205.19(d)). A new approval will be valid for 5 years (see proposed \u00a7 205.19(e)). If an organization's request for approval is denied, the organization may issue a request for reconsideration under 21 CFR 10.75 (see proposed \u00a7 205.19(f)). In addition, to ensure compliance and protect public health, FDA proposes that an AO may have its approval suspended if it does not maintain the standards outlined in this part (see proposed \u00a7 205.19(g)). A suspended AO must cease all 3PL licensure review including any pending inspections of 3PL facilities. A suspended AO must notify any 3PLs under a pending licensure review by the AO, of the AO's suspension within 7 calendar days (see proposed \u00a7 205.19(g)(5)). While most suspensions will happen only after notice and opportunity to request a hearing, under the proposed regulations, FDA reserves the ability to suspend approval prior to a hearing if there is a reasonable probability that the organization's noncompliance will cause imminent and serious adverse health consequences or death to humans (see proposed \u00a7 205.19(h)). Furthermore, FDA proposes that a suspended approval can be reinstated if the issue is resolved within 1 year from the date of suspension (see proposed \u00a7 205.19(i)), though it may be revoked if the organization fails to rectify the situation that resulted in the suspension (see proposed \u00a7 205.19(j)). FDA believes that 1 year provides the AO enough time to remedy most situations. An AO's approval may also be reinstated on a conditional basis. If the AO is conditionally reinstated, they will enter a three-year probationary period, during which if any material deficiencies arise, their license will be subject to immediate revocation (see proposed \u00a7 205.19(i)(2)). FDA also proposes to permit an AO to voluntarily withdraw its approval, but it must inform FDA of any facilities with pending reviews (see proposed \u00a7 205.19(l)). To further ensure that pending licensure reviews are not overlooked, under FDA's proposed regulation, an AO whose approval has been suspended, revoked, or voluntarily withdrawn has the responsibility to report this information to those 3PL facilities with pending licensure reviews (see proposed \u00a7 205.19(m)); this will stop the clock on the 90-day licensure review while the 3PL applies for licensure review from another AO or FDA. Also, to ensure that the AOs continue to meet the standards put forth in this subpart, and part 205 generally, under the proposed regulations, an AO must inform FDA of any changes to information that was submitted as part of its application for approval (see proposed \u00a7 205.19(n)(1)). Since the approval of an organization is nontransferable, changes in ownership also require an AO to submit a new application to FDA (see proposed \u00a7 205.19(n)(2)). Finally, as an additional assurance that an AO continues to comply with the provisions of this part, FDA proposes to require that AO's remain subject to periodic audits by FDA (see proposed \u00a7 205.19(o)). E. National Standards for Wholesale Distributors 1. Requirement That Wholesale Distributors Be Licensed To implement section 503(e)(1) of the FD&C Act, FDA is proposing to codify at \u00a7 205.20(a) the requirement that a wholesale distributor be licensed by the State from which the drug is distributed, or by FDA if the State from which the drug is distributed has not established a licensure requirement in accordance with the standards proposed herein, as well as by the State into which the drug is distributed if that State requires such a license. This requirement is consistent with how States currently license wholesale distributors. FDA anticipates that, for the purposes of annual reporting, a wholesale distributor who maintains multiple licenses to engage in wholesale distribution, will be able to report their required information aggregately for all their licenses (section 503(e)(2) of the FD&C Act). FDA believes this approach will increase efficiency for both wholesale distributors and the Agency, ensure that licenses for wholesale distribution facilities will be granted to qualified firms, and ensure records related to their facilities will be maintained in an organized fashion. In addition, FDA proposes to set the licensure term for wholesale distributors at 2 years (see proposed \u00a7 205.20(b)). FDA considered current State requirements, as well as the potential impacts on State and Agency resources, to determine the term for licensure. Ultimately, the Agency believes that 2 years aligns with current practices, does not place an undue burden on State or FDA resources, and provides adequate protection to American consumers because it ensures that renewals will be based on current information and operations. 2. Surety Bonds Wholesale distributors are required to obtain a surety bond to be licensed and engage in wholesale distribution (section 583(b)(3) of the FD&C Act). FDA is proposing to establish the terms of this requirement in proposed \u00a7 205.21. To receive or renew a license, a surety bond of $100,000, or $25,000 if applicable (for wholesale distributors with annual gross receipts of $10,000,000 or less), must be in place at the time the wholesale distributor's application for licensure or licensure renewal is submitted to the licensing authority (see proposed \u00a7 205.21(b)). The surety bond is intended to ensure compliance with DSCSA and that any administrative penalties levied by the licensing authorities are paid. DSCSA also permits the furnishing of ''other equivalent means of security acceptable to the State'' in lieu of a bond (section 583(b)(3)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act). It would be up to the State licensing authority to determine what, if anything, would constitute an equivalent means of security to a surety bond. Where FDA is the licensor, the wholesale distributor would need to furnish a surety bond to satisfy the bond requirement as other equivalent means of security appear to be specifically reserved for the States. While a bond is required before a wholesale distributor may acquire the necessary license, section 583(b)(3)(B) of the FD&C Act provides a set of circumstances under which the surety bond requirement will be waived. FDA is proposing to codify at \u00a7 205.21(b)(3) the DSCSA requirement that if a wholesale distributor can prove it has the necessary bond for the State where the facility is located ( e.g., by providing a copy of the existing security bond VerDate Sep<11>2014 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 24 / Friday, February 4, 2022 / Proposed Rules agreement), the requirement for an additional surety bond for another State is waived. In this situation, the wholesale distributor does not have to acquire an additional bond to satisfy the non-resident licensure requirements of the State into which the wholesale distributor plans to distribute. However, it remains unclear if and how this waiver should apply when an equivalent means of security to the surety bond are used. FDA requests comment specifically related to the waiver to the surety bond requirement and whether that waiver should apply to scenarios where some other equivalent means of security is used in lieu of a surety bond. The terms that a surety bond must include are outlined in proposed \u00a7 205.21(c). FDA proposes to require not only that the terms cover the liability requirements related to administrative penalties, but also that the bond remain in full force for 1 year after the license expires and that the surety company guarantee payment within 30 days of receiving notice from the licensing authority. FDA also proposes permitting licensing authorities to make claims against the surety bond for 1 year after the wholesale distributor's license expires or within 60 days after an administrative or legal proceeding has concluded, whichever is longer. These timeframes seek to ensure that the rights of the different parties involved in a potential claim will be adequately protected. This is particularly important with respect to the waiver because it allows the affected States equal access to the surety bond and ensures consistent standards across States. The implications of termination or lapse in coverage of a surety bond are detailed in proposed \u00a7 205.21(d). A wholesale distributor may cancel its surety bond, but FDA proposes to require that it give all impacted licensing authorities 30 days' prior notice before such cancellation take effect. Such notice is necessary because a wholesale distributor's license will be suspended upon the cancellation of the surety bond unless the wholesale distributor acquires a new bond before to the old bond is cancelled. FDA proposes that a license will be suspended if a licensing authority discovers a lapse in bond coverage. FDA also proposes to require that the surety bond permit actions to be brought by either a State or Federal licensing authority (see proposed \u00a7 205.21(e)), provide the contact information for the surety company (see proposed \u00a7 205.21(f)), and name the specific parties to the surety bond (see proposed \u00a7 205.21(h)). 3. General Requirements for Licensure This section includes the requirements for the application. FDA notes that the applicant would have to demonstrate compliance with the requirements as set forth in subpart C, including a satisfactory inspection, as described in proposed \u00a7 205.28, and criminal background checks for facility managers and designated representatives, as described in proposed \u00a7 205.25, to be granted a wholesale distributor license. The general application requirements that must be met for a State or Federal licensing authority to issue a wholesale distributor license are set forth in proposed \u00a7 205.22. The requirements applicable to the individual who submits the licensure application are detailed in proposed \u00a7 205.22(a). FDA proposes to require that the applicant submit all required information and pay a licensing fee in order to be considered for licensure. FDA believes these general requirements align with current industry practices. FDA is proposing at \u00a7 205.22(b) to require that the applicant provide the surety bond or other equivalent means of security acceptable to the State, required by section 583(b)(3) of the FD&C Act and detailed in proposed \u00a7 205.21, as part of the wholesale distributor's application for a license. The information that the licensing authority will require as part of a wholesale distributor's initial application for licensure and renewal applications is set forth in proposed \u00a7 205.22(c) and (d). This information is necessary for the licensing authority to assess whether the wholesale distributor is in good standing and has the infrastructure and capabilities to fulfill the duties and obligations of licensure. For example, FDA is proposing to require that a wholesale distributor inform FDA if it has received any citations for violating requirements for licensure or received any significant disciplinary actions within the past 7 years (see proposed \u00a7 205.22(c)(8)). FDA believes this information is necessary to ensure the wholesale distributor can demonstrate that it has not engaged in a pattern of violating the standards for licensure. The DSCSA defines prohibited persons, in part, as licensees who have ''engaged in a pattern of violating the requirements of this section, or State requirements for licensure, that presents a threat of serious adverse health consequences or death to humans'' (section 583(d) of the FD&C Act). Therefore, this information is necessary to demonstrate that a wholesale distributor is not prohibited from receiving or maintaining licensure for wholesale distribution. Finally, FDA proposes to require that a wholesale distributor's license be readily retrievable at the facility, and that the facility permit State or Federal inspectors, or others acting on behalf of the licensing authority, to inspect the license (see proposed \u00a7 205.22(e)). 4. The Federal Licensure Process Section 503(e) of the FD&C Act, as amended by DSCSA, requires FDA to license wholesale distributors directly if the State in which it engages in wholesale distribution has not established a licensing requirement (section 503(e)(1) of the FD&C Act). Proposed \u00a7 205.23 details the process that FDA will use when issuing licenses to wholesale distributors. While this section is only applicable to wholesale distributors obtaining a license from FDA, FDA suggests States implement similar procedures to ensure that all wholesale distributor licenses issued are consistent with the proposed regulation pursuant to section 503(e)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act. FDA plans to make information available to clarify who is the appropriate licensing authority in the wholesale distributor's State. FDA believes this streamlined process for application will allow for greater clarity and harmonization across the industry. For wholesale distributor license applications submitted to FDA, FDA proposes that the wholesale distributor submit the application electronically, including the information outlined in proposed \u00a7\u00a7 205.21 and 205.22, along with additional supporting documentation (see proposed \u00a7 205.23(a)(1)). The DSCSA authorizes FDA's use of third-party organizations\u2014 AOs\u2014to conduct inspections of wholesale distributors required under section 583(c) of the FD&C Act. If FDA has approved one or more AOs to inspect wholesale distributors, the wholesale distributor should note the AO it prefers to conduct its inspection on the application submitted to FDA (see proposed \u00a7 205.23(a)(2)). If no AO has been approved, FDA will conduct the inspection (see proposed \u00a7 205.23(a)(3)). Furthermore, submission of the application to FDA will not be considered complete until FDA receives all pertinent information and fees (see proposed \u00a7 205.23(a)(5)). While the DSCSA permits AOs to conduct inspections of wholesale distributors applying for licensure, the responsibility of determining whether a wholesale distributor meets all the applicable requirements set forth in this proposed regulation remains with FDA (see proposed \u00a7 205.23(b)). Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 24 / Friday, February 4, 2022 / Proposed Rules delays in the licensure process, FDA intends to work with wholesale distributors to correct minor errors made on the application ( e.g., missing written policies and procedures) and communicate with the wholesale distributor about additional information the Agency may need to process and review the application (see proposed \u00a7 205.23(c)). If the wholesale distributor meets the requirements outlined in this proposed part and none of the prohibited factors listed in proposed \u00a7 205.30(a)(1) are present, FDA will approve the application and send an approval letter and license certificate (see proposed \u00a7 205.23(d)). FDA recognizes that a wholesale distributor may have concerns about what happens to the status of its license if disciplinary sanctions are taken against the approval status of the AO that conducted its inspection when applying for licensure or if the organization is otherwise no longer considered an approved AO. While FDA believes that a wholesale distributor should not be penalized for the actions of the AO, FDA must ensure that the AO's review and findings provide a reliable basis for licensing decisions. As such, FDA is proposing that, if the wholesale distributor is otherwise in good standing, a change in the approval status of the AO that conducted the inspection of the wholesale distributor will not automatically affect the licensure of a licensed wholesale distributor (see proposed \u00a7 205.23(e)). Rather, in the event that an AO has disciplinary sanctions taken against it, ends its business, or is otherwise no longer considered an approved AO, the license of any wholesale distributor reviewed by that AO will be subject to appropriate action in accordance with \u00a7 205.30 and other applicable statutes or regulations. FDA may verify the wholesale distributor's compliance status and review the facts in that situation to determine the potential effect, if any, on the licensure of wholesale distributors inspected by that AO. 5. Changes to Information, Ownership, or Location of Licensed Wholesale Distributors FDA recognizes that information about a business can change over time. However, for the licensing authority to effectively carry out its responsibilities, license information must remain current and changes in information previously submitted must be reported to the licensing authority. Currently, the reporting requirements for these types of changes vary by State. FDA is proposing the establishment of specific timeframes for reporting changes (see proposed \u00a7 205.24) and believes that standardizing the timeframes will help make reporting business-related changes less burdensome for industry and licensing authorities. FDA is proposing that the wholesale distributor submit changes to certain information, such as the information submitted with a surety bond or as part of an application for licensure, to the licensing authority within 30 calendar days of the date the change became effective (see proposed \u00a7 205.24(a)). Significant changes, such as changes in location or changes to the person engaged in wholesale distribution, require the added scrutiny that comes with an inspection or review of an application for a new license to ensure that the entity will be able to continue to meet the standards for licensure in its new location or under its new management. For this reason, FDA is proposing that changes in location or changes to the person engaged in wholesale distribution will require an inspection or new license (see proposed \u00a7 205.24(b) and (c)). FDA recognizes that the ownership of a facility from which a wholesale distributor leases the facility and conducts wholesale distribution may change without the wholesale distribution operation changing in any meaningful way. If that change does not impact the wholesale distribution operation, the wholesale distributor will not need to apply for a new license. As described in proposed \u00a7 205.24(b)(1), the date the change of location takes place is the date the new location begins receiving prescription drugs. 6. Prohibited Persons and Qualifications for Key Personnel The FD&C Act, as amended by DSCSA, requires FDA to establish and implement standards for the qualifications of wholesale distributors' key personnel (section 583(b)(5) of the FD&C Act). As discussed above and proposed at \u00a7 205.3(g), FDA considers key personnel to include individuals with responsibility for managing the operations of the wholesale distributor, including any principal, owner, director, officer of the wholesale distributor, facility manager or designated representative, or other individuals who are authorized to enter into areas where prescription drugs are held and are likely to handle those prescription drugs as a part of their responsibilities within the operation. FDA believes the qualifications for key personnel proposed in \u00a7 205.25 are necessary to ensure that all the individuals who are responsible for operating the wholesale distributor's facility are appropriately qualified to carry out their duties and that the wholesale distributor meets the national standards. Proposed \u00a7 205.25(a) lists conduct that prohibits a wholesale distributor from obtaining licensure. Proposed \u00a7 205.25(b) establishes the basic standards for key personnel working within a wholesale distribution facility. Key personnel must have the appropriate education, background, training, and experience necessary to carry out their assigned functions within the operation. No one within the facility should carry out the responsibilities of key personnel without the proper training and expertise. As a part of FDA's responsibility to establish and implement standards for the qualifications of wholesale distributors' key personnel, FDA is proposing that wholesale distributors and their key personnel meet certain other qualifications. Licensure may be denied if a wholesale distributor or any of their key personnel do not meet the standards for qualification as outlined in proposed \u00a7 205.25(c). Key personnel working for a wholesale distributor hold critical positions of trust for protecting the security of the prescription drug supply chain. FDA believes it would be a best practice for a firm to require that all employees not engage in the illegal use of controlled substances while serving in their capacity in the wholesale distribution operation and request that all employees so state. FDA is proposing to require wholesale distributors to establish and implement written policies and procedures to ensure that their key personnel meet the qualifications contained in this proposed section (see proposed \u00a7 205.25(e)) and to maintain certain information about their key personnel that demonstrates they are qualified to carry out the duties assigned to them (see proposed \u00a7 205.25(b)), including having the proper education and training (see proposed \u00a7 205.25(e)(3)). Proposed \u00a7 205.25(f) also limits a facility manager or designated representative to hold that position at one facility at a time. This is to ensure that the facility manager or designated representative is actively engaged in managing the daily operations of the facility and that they remain aware of any non-compliance issues that may arise. The FD&C Act, as amended by DSCSA, specifically requires licensure standards to include mandatory background checks and fingerprinting of wholesale distributor facility managers and their designated representatives VerDate Sep<11>2014 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 24 / Friday, February 4, 2022 / Proposed Rules (section 583(b)(4) of the FD&C Act). Entrusting individuals with the responsibility of distributing prescription drugs prior to a criminal background check may jeopardize the integrity of the drug supply chain and leave the public exposed to unnecessary harm posed by the possible introduction of drugs that are unsafe. FDA is proposing to codify at \u00a7 205.25(g) the requirement for facility managers and their designated representatives to submit a full set of fingerprints to conduct local and national criminal background checks. The background check, when completed, must demonstrate that the facility manager or designated representative has no history of criminal convictions pursuant to proposed \u00a7 205.25(a). FDA suggests, when a wholesale distributor staffs its operation, it is a best practice that the individuals who work within their operation and have access to prescription drugs not have a record of criminal activity involving violations of the FD&C Act or other laws involving prescription drugs. This best practice is recommended to help ensure security within a wholesale distributor. When screening personnel who work in areas of a facility where prescription drugs are held, including the facility manager or designated representative, FDA recommends that a wholesale distributor consider whether such personnel have (1) engaged in a pattern of violating the requirements of section 583 of the FD&C Act that present a threat of serious adverse health consequences or death to humans; (2) been found to have committed or facilitated commission of any prohibited acts under the FD&C Act or violated or facilitated any violations of any of the regulations in this part or analogous provisions of the State licensing authority, as applicable; (3) been convicted of any violation Federal, State, or local laws relating to drug samples, wholesale or retail drug distribution, distribution of controlled substances, or 3PL services; or (4) been convicted of any felony under Federal, State, or local laws involving or related to prescription drugs. FDA believes that wholesale distributors should consider an applicant's history of violations of the FD&C Act or other laws involving prescription drugs when making staffing decisions. 7. Wholesale Distributor Storage and Handling of Prescription Drugs, and Required Policies and Procedures The DSCSA charges FDA with creating national standards for the storage and handling of prescription drugs by wholesale distributors, including facility requirements (section 583(b)(1) of the FD&C Act). To ensure confidence that the prescription drug delivered maintains its quality and integrity throughout the distribution process, FDA believes that wholesale distributors should establish and maintain quality systems that encompass the organizational structure, account for potential vulnerabilities or threats to the systems, and clearly articulate the procedures and processes for all wholesale distribution activity. A proper quality system should be fully documented, and the effectiveness of the system should be continually monitored to ensure the quality is maintained. This includes ensuring that facilities and equipment are properly maintained for their purposes of storing and distributing prescription drugs; that personnel are properly qualified, screened, and trained for their positions; and that documentation is comprehensive. Regular management review of all aspects of the quality systems in place is important for maintaining these high standards. FDA proposes \u00a7 205.26, which establishes basic requirements that will assist wholesale distributors in achieving these goals. Although the FD&C Act permits an entity to be more than one type of trading partner so long as it complies with all the applicable requirements (section 582(a)(1) of the FD&C Act), FDA believes that the processes and functions of each type of entity need to be kept separate for the licensing authority to ensure the entity is complying with all the applicable requirements. Accordingly, FDA is proposing that any wholesale distributor's facility that is also licensed or registered as another trading partner and operating from the same address must have separate systems and processes in place for their separate functions (see proposed \u00a7 205.26(a)). FDA believes that proper storage and handling of prescription drugs inherently requires the establishment of standards that address physical requirements for the facility space in which drugs are stored and handled, along with standards that address the manner in which drugs are to be securely stored and handled within the facility of a wholesale distributor. In \u00a7 205.26(b), FDA proposes the following requirements with regard to standards placed on the wholesale distributor's facility. FDA believes these facility requirements will ensure that their establishments are appropriate for the distribution (including storage) of prescription drugs. The facility must be of a suitable size, configuration, and design to ensure proper storage, maintenance, and cleanliness (see proposed \u00a7 205.26(b)(1)(ii) through (iv)). The facility must also be equipped with clearly defined areas that separate drugs that are unfit for distribution, from those that are saleable to avoid potential mistakes when distributing the prescription drugs (see proposed \u00a7 205.26(b)(1)(vi)). The facility must be sufficiently secure to protect the prescription drugs in the supply chain from possible theft or diversion (see proposed \u00a7 205.26(b)(2)). Facilities must protect against unauthorized entry and ensure that the premises are well lit and not vulnerable to intrusion (see proposed \u00a7 205.26(b)(2)(i) through (iii)). Entry and access to areas where prescription drugs are held within the facility must be limited to those who have the appropriate experience and training needed to conduct wholesale distribution (see proposed \u00a7 205.26(b)(2)(iv)). These basic security requirements will help wholesale distributors protect and safeguard the prescription drugs maintained in their facility. A wholesale distributor has the responsibility of ensuring that prescription drugs are stored under proper conditions to maintain the safety and effectiveness of the drugs it distributes. Accordingly, a wholesale distributor's facility must maintain appropriate equipment ( e.g., refrigeration and air conditioning equipment) in good working order to ensure that prescription drugs are properly stored in the facility (see proposed \u00a7 205.26(b)(3)). To this end, FDA is proposing to require that a wholesale distributor establish written procedures to ensure that its equipment is installed and maintained by qualified individuals (see proposed \u00a7 205.26(b)(3)(i)). Written policies and procedures include those that are stored and maintained electronically. Upon inspection, a wholesale distributor must demonstrate and verify that its equipment is in working order and has been periodically assessed in accordance with the wholesale distributor's written procedures to ensure the equipment's continued functionality (see proposed \u00a7 205.26(b)(3)(i)), which is critical in ensuring that those drugs retain their safety and effectiveness throughout the supply chain. Additionally, a wholesale distributor must regularly conduct and document facility assessments to make sure that drugs are properly stored in accordance VerDate Sep<11>2014 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 24 / Friday, February 4, 2022 / Proposed Rules with their labeling (see proposed \u00a7 205.26(b)(4)). FDA expects that, as a crucial part of the creation of a quality system, wholesale distributors will establish, maintain, and follow written policies and procedures regarding the safeguarding of the prescription drugs within their control. Proposed \u00a7 205.26(c) outlines several requirements for maintaining written policies and procedures to ensure that the requirements are carried out properly and consistently. Wholesale distributors are not limited to establishing written policies and procedures for the stated functions in proposed \u00a7 205.26(c), as a wholesale distributor may wish to establish written policies and procedures pertaining to other aspects of wholesale distribution and staffing of their facilities. The purpose of requiring written policies and procedures is to assist staff and management at a wholesale distribution facility to determine the processes required to ensure safe storage and distribution of prescription drugs. Proposed \u00a7 205.26(c) includes the requirement that wholesale distributors establish and follow written policies and procedures to ensure that a wholesale distributor: (1) Only does business with other authorized trading partners (see proposed \u00a7 205.26(c)(1)); (2) properly maintains equipment in good working order as outlined in proposed \u00a7 205.26(b)(3) (see proposed \u00a7 205.26(c)(2)); (3) transports prescription drugs in a manner designed to avoid breakage and exposure (see proposed \u00a7 205.26(c)(3)); (4) inspects shipping containers for suspect or illegitimate products, as well as other quality issues that may render the prescription drug unfit for distribution (see proposed \u00a7 205.26(c)(4)); (5) stores and handles the prescription drugs they warehouse and distribute in accordance with the prescription drug's labeling (see proposed \u00a7 205.26(c)(5)); (6) properly retains, returns, or destroys drugs removed from the supply chain depending on the proper disposition of the prescription drug (see proposed \u00a7 205.26(c)(6)); and (7) is prepared to protect against reasonably foreseeable crises that could affect security or operations at the facility (see proposed \u00a7 205.26(c)(7)). 8. Recordkeeping Proper recordkeeping is essential to the timely identification, recording, and reporting of issues arising within the supply chain. Section 583(b)(2) of the FD&C Act requires FDA to create national standards for establishing and maintaining records pertaining to the distribution of prescription drugs. FDA is proposing in \u00a7 205.27(a) that these records include documentation pertaining to the security, storage, handling, inventory, shipping, sale, purchase, trade, delivery, and receipt of prescription drugs, as well as policies, procedures, instructions, contracts, data, inspection reports, and any other documentation related to compliance with this part, such as invoices, purchase orders, packing slips, and shipping records. These records could be stored and maintained electronically. These records maintenance requirements will allow for greater confidence in the information preserved at the facility and potentially disseminated to other trading partners. The maintenance, availability, and accuracy of the records made available for inspection under section 583(b)(6) of the FD&C Act are critical to ensure that wholesale distributors are acting in compliance with this proposed regulation and that the records can be relied upon to identify any potential risk to the public health. As such, FDA is proposing to require that all records be securely stored, and that any alterations made to records be signed and dated, while preserving the original information contained in the record (see proposed \u00a7 205.27(b)). This is intended to ensure that all records related to the distribution of prescription drugs provide transparency and accurately reflect the activities of the wholesale distributor. FDA also believes that reliability of the records is contingent on having processes and procedures in place that restrict access to and protect the integrity of the data. To this end, FDA is proposing to require in \u00a7 205.27(c) that wholesale distributors implement written policies and procedures to protect the integrity of their records. Under proposed \u00a7 205.27(d), all records would be retained for a period of 3 years, except records related to suspect and illegitimate products, prescription drug quality complaints, and destroyed, returned, and recalled prescription drugs, which would need to be retained for a period of 6 years. Such record retention is necessary to ensure compliance and consistent enforcement of the various record keeping requirements of sections 582, 583, and 584 of the FD&C Act. 9. Inspections Section 583(b)(6) of the FD&C Act directs FDA to establish national standards for a mandatory physical inspection of any facility used in wholesale distribution within a reasonable time frame from the initial application (section 583(b)(6) of the FD&C Act). FDA believes that it is imperative for the mandatory physical inspection to take place prior to issuing an initial license to a wholesale distributor to ensure that only those wholesale distributors who have the ability to properly store, handle, and distribute prescription drugs in accordance with the national standards are licensed. Accordingly, in proposed \u00a7 205.28(a), wholesale distributors are required to undergo a physical inspection before the licensing authority issues the initial license. As used in subpart C, licensing authority means the State licensing authority or FDA. To satisfy the inspection requirement, section 583(c) of the FD&C Act permits the licensing authority to conduct the inspection or accept an inspection by the State in which the facility is located or by a third-party accreditation or inspection service approved by the licensing authority in accordance with these standards. FDA has codified this provision at proposed \u00a7 205.28(a)(1) and (2). Additionally, FDA believes that section 583(c) can be applied to State licensure of non-resident wholesale distributors to ship into a State and proposes that a State into which a drug is distributed may use the same methods to satisfy the inspection requirement for non-resident wholesale distributors (see proposed \u00a7 205.28(a)(1)(iii)). FDA believes that requiring a satisfactory inspection prior to licensure will ensure that only wholesale distributors with appropriate facilities and equipment for storing and distributing prescription drugs are granted a license to participate in the supply chain. FDA is proposing to require that the physical inspection of wholesale distributor facilities include the facility itself, processes related to all wholesale distribution activities, and paper and electronically stored records; that wholesale distributors permit inspections at reasonable times; and that the licensing authority conduct its inspection in a reasonable manner (see proposed \u00a7 205.28(b) and (c)). FDA believes that authentication of records during an inspection is important to maintain confidence in documentation preserved by the wholesale distributor, which may contain information about nonsaleable prescription drugs or be disseminated to other trading partners. FDA proposes that a wholesale distributor be required to make records available during inspections, including records that are held offsite in the normal course of business. The failure of a wholesale distributor to produce VerDate Sep<11>2014 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 24 / Friday, February 4, 2022 / Proposed Rules records in a timely manner during an inspection can significantly affect the licensing authority's ability to complete the inspection. Therefore, FDA is proposing that a wholesale distributor be required to provide offsite records within 2 business days of a request for such records by a State or Federal official, or sooner if necessitated by the duration of the inspection (see proposed \u00a7 205.28(b)). FDA also proposes the requirement that a wholesale distributor cooperate with the State or Federal licensing authority, or the AO conducting the inspection, at reasonable times, within reasonable limits, and in a reasonable manner to achieve the objective of the inspection (see proposed \u00a7 205.28(c)). Finally, FDA believes routine inspections are an essential tool to ensure that wholesale distributors continue to comply with the national standards after obtaining their initial wholesale distributor license and move to renew that license. Accordingly, FDA is proposing to require that wholesale distributors undergo routine inspections at least once every 3 years (see proposed \u00a7 205.28(d)). In developing the inspection timeframes, FDA sought to balance the risk to the supply chain with FDA's and State licensing authorities' resource constraints. These routine inspections allow FDA or the licensing authority to ensure that wholesale distributors maintain the levels of quality storage and maintenance of prescription drugs at their facilities expected by FDA to safeguard the supply chain. 10. Annual and Other Reporting to FDA Under DSCSA, wholesale distributors must report certain information to FDA as part of the requirement to be considered an authorized trading partner (sections 581(2)(B) and 503(e)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act). The annual reporting requirements for wholesale distributors went into effect on January 1, 2015, and FDA has published draft industry guidance that communicates draft Agency expectations for annual reporting while these regulations are being developed (79 FR 73083, December 9, 2014, and 82 FR 3004, January 10, 2017). Proposed \u00a7 205.29 clarifies the statutorily prescribed annual reporting requirements. The DSCSA requires that any wholesale distributor who owns or operates an establishment that engages in wholesale distribution report to FDA on an annual basis: (1) The State in which the wholesale distributor is licensed; (2) the identification number of its wholesale distributor's license; (3) the name, address, and contact information for the wholesale distributor; (4) all trade names under which the licensed wholesale distributor conducts business; and (5) any significant disciplinary actions taken against the wholesale distributor (section 503(e)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act). FDA is proposing to require that wholesale distributors use an electronic reporting system provided by FDA (see proposed \u00a7 205.29(a)). This electronic system will increase efficiency by providing uniformity in report content and format, making the information easier to process for regularly updating the public database (section 503(e)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act). In addition, FDA believes having the license status of wholesale distributors in one publicly available database would be helpful for FDA, trading partners, and other stakeholders in determining whether wholesale distributors are authorized, as defined in section 581(2)(B) of the FD&C Act. Reporting information for each wholesale distributor in FDA's electronic system during the reporting period is integral to FDA's ability to provide oversight, as wholesale distributors are prohibited from distributing product without a license. FDA proposes that the annual reporting schedule will require all wholesale distributors to report each calendar year between January 1st and March 31st, although an entity may update information at any time (see proposed \u00a7 205.29(b)). For example, if a wholesale distributor chooses to update a license on December 15, 2019, that wholesale distributor will still have to report during the January 1, 2020, through March 31, 2020, annual reporting period. The specific information that wholesale distributors must electronically report to FDA is set forth in proposed \u00a7 205.29(c). The DSCSA requires licensed entities to report to FDA each State by which they are licensed and each license number (section 503(e)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the FD&C Act). FDA is proposing that the wholesale distributor also submit the expiration date of its State licenses (see proposed \u00a7 205.29(c)). The submission of the wholesale distributor's license expiration date is paramount to FDA's ability to establish and maintain a public database identifying each authorized wholesale distributor as required by section 503(e)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act. If a wholesale distributor's license expires, it is no longer an authorized trading partner, and FDA will remove it from the public database until the license is renewed or a new license issued. Similarly, FDA is proposing that a wholesale distributor be required to report to FDA within 30 calendar days that it has gone out of business or voluntarily withdrawn a wholesale distributor's license from a State (see proposed \u00a7 205.30(e)). Again, FDA believes that requiring a wholesale distributor to report this information about the status of its license is essential for FDA to comply with the requirements under section 503(e)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act and to ensure that the database is accurate and helpful for the States and trading partners. The DSCSA also requires that wholesale distributors report the name, address, and contact information for each facility at which, and all the trade names under which, the wholesale distributor conducts business (section 503(e)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act). In implementing this requirement, FDA is proposing to require the wholesale distributor to provide the company name that is identical to the official company name appearing on the license, along with the full business address that is associated with the State or Federal license (see proposed \u00a7 205.29(c)(2)). Additionally, FDA is requesting that wholesale distributors submit a UFI that corresponds with the facility name and facility address. The UFI for a wholesale distributor's facility is useful to FDA in identifying and confirming certain business information. A wholesale distributor should obtain a separate UFI for each physical address it reports. FDA has published guidance on annual reporting that can assist wholesale distributors if they require additional information regarding the UFI reporting recommendation. In addition, FDA believes the wholesale distributor's contact information should include someone familiar with the daily operations of the wholesale distributor's facility and who has the authority to act on inquiries to ensure efficient processing of inquiries and minimize the impact inquiries may have on the facility's daily operations. Therefore, wholesale distributors must submit the contact information of the facility manager or designated representative, including that individual's name, telephone number, and email address, with its annual reporting requirements pursuant to section 503(e)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. DSCSA requires a wholesale distributor to report to FDA any significant disciplinary action taken by a State or Federal government against the wholesale distributor (section 503(e)(2) of FD&C Act). A significant disciplinary action is defined the VerDate Sep<11>2014 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 24 / Friday, February 4, 2022 / Proposed Rules proposed regulation, in relevant part, as any action by a State or Federal licensing authority that limits or prevents a wholesale distributor from distributing or facilitating the distribution of prescription drugs (see proposed \u00a7 205.3(l)). FDA proposes that wholesale distributors report during the reporting period to FDA all significant disciplinary actions that occurred during the preceding 12-month period (see proposed \u00a7 205.29(d)(1)). After the reporting period, FDA proposes that within 30 calendar days after a significant disciplinary action is imposed or taken by a State or Federal government, wholesale distributors report the type of disciplinary action, the date the action was taken, and the State where the disciplinary action occurred, as well as submit any documents associated with the disciplinary action, including a final ruling by the relevant State or Federal agency or board or a consent decree (see proposed \u00a7 205.29(c)(4) and (d)). While wholesale distributors do not ordinarily have to report DEA registration numbers or State controlled substances licenses to FDA for annual reporting purposes, FDA suggests that such information be provided as part of its report under section 503(e)(2)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act when there is a significant disciplinary action issued by the DEA or the State controlled substances licensing authority that would limit the ability of the wholesale distributor to distribute controlled drug substances. In such a situation, information about the DEA registration or State controlled substance license should be reported since the disciplinary action is reported under that specific license or registration. 11. Licensure Denial, Suspension, Reinstatement and Revocation\u2014Notice and Opportunity To Request a Hearing The standards for licensure denial are set forth in proposed \u00a7 205.30. Proposed \u00a7 205.30(a)(1) lists 10 circumstances under which a licensing authority will be required to deny a wholesale distributor's request for licensure or licensure renewal. FDA believes that these reasons requiring denial will ensure wholesale distributors focus on good storage practices outlined by FDA and are necessary to protect the integrity of the products in the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Wholesale distributors should seek to ensure that these reasons outlined in proposed \u00a7 205.30(a)(1) are addressed when the wholesale distributor files for licensure to avoid denial or delays of their application. Proposed \u00a7 205.30(a)(2) through (5) details the process afforded to wholesale distributors whose applications for licensure have been denied. FDA is proposing to give applicants the opportunity to provide additional information for reconsideration of the denial. If the licensing authority denies a wholesale distributor's request for licensure after reconsideration, the wholesale distributor will receive a notice of opportunity to request for hearing under existing FDA hearing procedure. FDA requests comment regarding the reconsideration and appeal process outlined in this regulation for wholesale distributors whose applications for licensure have been denied. The proposed standards for suspending a wholesale distributor's license are set forth in \u00a7 205.30(b) and (c). A suspended wholesale distributor must cease all receipt and distribution of prescription drugs until their license is re-instated. The proposed standards for suspension are based on the severity of risk posed to the public health. For example, under proposed \u00a7 205.30(b), a wholesale distributor's license may be suspended only after the wholesale distributor receives a notice of opportunity for hearing. If the licensing authority has a reasonable belief that the wholesale distributor is not in compliance with licensure requirements and such noncompliance threatens the quality of the product or threatens public safety, the licensing authority is required to notify the wholesale distributor in writing of the intent to suspend its license. A wholesale distributor will have 30 days upon the date of the notice of intent to suspend a license to provide additional information to the licensing authority so it may reconsider its decision to suspend the wholesale distributor license. If reconsideration is not sought, or if reconsideration is denied, the licensing authority will inform the wholesale distributor in writing of its formal intent to proceed with license suspension. The notice will contain a statement informing the wholesale distributor that it has an opportunity to request a hearing on the question of whether there are sufficient grounds for suspension. The wholesale distributor will have 10 days after the date of the notice to inform the licensing authority of its intent to request a hearing; otherwise the opportunity for a hearing will be waived and the license suspended. FDA requests comment regarding this reconsideration and appeal process. Proposed \u00a7 205.30(c) allows for suspension prior to notice and opportunity for a hearing and for suspension to be effective immediately if the wholesale distributor's noncompliance poses an imminent threat to public safety. For example, if a wholesale distributor is distributing illegitimate product, and once made aware, does not take corrective actions to protect the public from the threat of these products, its license could be suspended immediately. Another example would be a scenario where the conditions under which drugs are held cause the product to be illegitimate and the wholesale distributor refuses to correct the conditions or continues to ship these illegitimate products. Under the proposed regulation, if the licensing authority proceeds with suspension in such a situation, the licensing authority will inform the wholesale distributor in writing that its license is suspended. The notice will also contain a statement informing the wholesale distributor that it may request a hearing and that hearing, if granted, will be afforded within 10 days of the receipt of the wholesale distributor's request for hearing. The wholesale distributor has 10 days from the date on the notice of suspension to request a hearing; otherwise its opportunity for a hearing will be waived. FDA believes that this limits the amount of time a wholesale distributor's license would be suspended while providing a reasonable amount of time both for the wholesale distributor to review a notice of suspension and collect the necessary information to demonstrate that its license should not be suspended, and for FDA to consider the hearing request, and to schedule and prepare for a hearing, if the hearing request is granted. FDA believes immediate suspension of a wholesale distributor's license is crucial in cases where continued operation of the wholesale distributor presents an imminent threat to public safety and the pharmaceutical supply chain. Under proposed \u00a7 205.30(d), a wholesale distributor's suspended license may be reinstated if the wholesale distributor can demonstrate to the licensing authority that it is in compliance with this proposed regulation. Under the proposed rule the process outlined at \u00a7 10.75 is the default for appeals related to a denied application for a wholesale distributor license, and the hearing process outlined at 21 CFR part 16 is the default for appeals related to a suspended or revoked wholesale distributor license. However, the wholesale distributor may request any of the procedures contained in 21 CFR parts 10 through 16. FDA believes that VerDate Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 24 / Friday, February 4, 2022 / Proposed Rules this proposed approach is consistent with current practice and suggests that States develop comparable processes. The standards for revoking a wholesale distributor license are set forth in proposed \u00a7 205.30(e). The licensing authority will revoke a license if it finds that a wholesale distributor whose license has been suspended is unable or refuses to comply with the licensing requirements. The requirements governing the revocation of a wholesale distributor license are set forth in proposed \u00a7 205.30(e)(2) through (4) and mirror the process outlined in \u00a7 205.30(b)(2) through (7), with one exception: When the licensing authority informs the wholesale distributor of its intent to revoke a license, the wholesale distributor is given no opportunity for reconsideration since it already had an opportunity to rectify deficiencies while its license was suspended. In addition, where a wholesale distributor fails to timely renew its application, the license will be considered expired and the wholesale distributor will need to submit an application for new licensure if it seeks to resume wholesale distribution activities, because the licensing authority may be unable to confirm that the wholesale distributor continues to meet all necessary licensure requirements (see proposed \u00a7 205.30(f)). If a wholesale distributor's license expires, it must cease receipt and distribution of prescription drugs until their license has been re-instated. FDA is also proposing that the licensing authority will terminate a wholesale distributor's license upon request from the wholesale distributor when the request includes a notice of the wholesale distributor's intent to discontinue its activities and a waiver of an opportunity for a hearing. The wholesale distributor will be required to apply for a new license should it decide to resume wholesale distribution activities (see proposed \u00a7 205.30(g)). F. Approved Organizations for Wholesale Distributors 1. Approval of Outside Organizations and Utilization of Such Organizations in the Licensure Process The FD&C Act, as amended by DSCSA, allows the Federal or State licensing authority to accept inspections of wholesale distributors conducted by third-party accreditation or inspection services they have approved to be part of the licensure process (section 583(c) of FD&C Act). Subpart D of the proposed rules defines the scope of work these approved organizations (AOs) would be tasked with performing, as well as the standards an AO must meet to become approved by FDA. Additionally, this subpart will explain the circumstances in which an inspection conducted by an AO may be used, what activities the AOs have the authority to conduct and are expected to conduct, and the qualifications that each third-party organization must possess to become approved by FDA. FDA suggests that States that choose to rely on AOs to conduct inspections have in place the same or similar qualifications and processes for approved organizations to conduct those inspections and for decisions affecting the approval status of those organizations. FDA proposes that an AO must complete an inspection no more than 90 days after receiving notice from the licensing authority to conduct an inspection (see proposed \u00a7 205.31(b)). FDA believes this allows AOs sufficient time to perform the work with which they are tasked while also ensuring that the wholesale distributor's activities are not significantly delayed or otherwise impacted due to delays in the inspection process. Upon completion of the inspection, the AO would then provide FDA with a report based on the inspection within 7 days (see proposed \u00a7 205.31(b)(2) and (3)), with copy of the report to the wholesale distributor facility (see proposed \u00a7 205.31(b)(3)). Using the report submitted by the AO, FDA makes the final determination as to whether a wholesale distributor facility should be issued a license. It is important that FDA be able to verify an AO's continued compliance with the requirements of the proposed regulation. Therefore, to become an AO and keep its approval, FDA is proposing to require that an AO maintain certain records for a period of at least 5 years and make these records readily available to FDA upon request (see proposed \u00a7 205.31(c)). In addition, to ensure public safety, FDA is proposing to require that AOs report certain observations at wholesale distributor facilities to FDA immediately (see proposed \u00a7 205.31(c)(4)). The general qualifications for approval are set out in proposed \u00a7 205.32. To become and remain approved, FDA is proposing to require that an organization, and those employed by the organization, abide by certain guidelines intended to secure against conflicts of interest, promote professional business practices, and protect non-public information (see proposed \u00a7 205.32(a)). FDA is proposing to allow AOs to hire outside contractors to conduct inspections. Under FDA's proposed regulation, AOs who decide to use outside contractors must ensure that they effectively carry out the inspection in a manner consistent with this proposed regulation to protect public health, conform to conflict of interest provisions, and properly protect all non- public information (see proposed \u00a7 205.32(b)). For an AO to maintain approval, FDA proposes to require that the AO ensure contractors abide by all applicable confidentiality agreements, the AO has policies and procedures in place to ensure the contractors abide by these proposed standards, and the contractors have the necessary training and expertise to carry out inspections of wholesale distributor facilities (see proposed \u00a7 205.32(b)(1)). Before a contractor hired by an AO may perform an inspection of a wholesale distributor, the wholesale distributor must have entered into an agreement with the AO giving the AO permission to share with contractors the wholesale distributor's confidential commercial information (see proposed \u00a7 205.32(b)(2)). If such consent is not provided by the wholesale distributor, the AO will perform the inspection itself, without the use of contractors. FDA believes that this approach is reasonable given that it is the AO's decision to work with contractors and, under this proposed regulation, the ultimate responsibility for the inspection and the protection of the wholesale distributor's information rests with the AO. In addition, FDA proposes that AOs must submit to FDA a list of the contractors used by the organization and must certify that such contractors comply with the applicable regulations (see proposed \u00a7 205.32(b)(3)). Finally, to ensure that the standards set forth in this subpart are followed, FDA proposes to require that the AOs remain responsible for all the work performed by outside contractors (see proposed \u00a7 205.32(b)). FDA proposes that to maintain their approved status, AOs must prohibit contractors from subcontracting their inspection duties (see proposed \u00a7 205.32(b)(1)(ii)). Limiting the ability of contactors to further delegate their responsibility ensures that FDA will have accurate information about who is conducting inspections, that those responsible for the inspections have the necessary qualifications, and that their conduct is governed by this proposed regulation. The proposed process that FDA will use to approve organizations, including the application process, as well as the process for suspending or revoking an organization's approval, are set forth in proposed \u00a7 205.33. FDA is proposing that organizations seeking Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 24 / Friday, February 4, 2022 / Proposed Rules FDA must electronically submit to FDA an application demonstrating the organization's ability to assess compliance with all wholesale distributor requirements detailed in proposed part 205 (see proposed \u00a7 205.33(a) and (b)), and employees must complete the necessary training as directed by FDA (see proposed \u00a7 205.33(c)). To verify information contained in the application and ensure compliance with the proposed regulation, FDA proposes that, before an AO may conduct its first inspection, a newly approved organization must be audited by FDA (see proposed \u00a7 205.33(d)). A new approval will be valid for 5 years (see proposed \u00a7 205.33(e)). If an organization's request for approval is denied, the organization may submit a request for reconsideration under \u00a7 10.75 (see proposed \u00a7 205.33(f)). In addition, FDA proposes that an AO may have its approval suspended if it does not maintain the standards outlined in this section (see proposed \u00a7 205.33(g)). A suspended AO must cease all inspections of wholesale distributors. A suspended AO must notify any wholesale distributors with a pending inspection to be performed by the AO of the AO's suspension within 7 calendar days (see proposed \u00a7 205.33(g)(5). While most suspensions will happen only after notice and opportunity to request a hearing, under the proposed regulations, FDA reserves the ability to suspend approval prior to a hearing if there is a reasonable probability that the organization's noncompliance will cause imminent and serious adverse health consequences or death to humans (see proposed \u00a7 205.33(h)). Furthermore, FDA proposes that a suspended approval can be reinstated if the issue is resolved within 1 year from the date of suspension (see proposed \u00a7 205.33(i)), though it may be revoked if the organization fails to rectify the situation that resulted in the suspension (see proposed \u00a7 205.33(j)). FDA believes that 1 year provides the AO enough time to remedy most situations. An AO's approval may also be reinstated on a conditional basis. If the AO is conditionally reinstated, they will enter a three-year probationary period, during which if any material deficiencies arise, their approval will be subject to immediate revocation (see proposed \u00a7 205.33(i)(2)). FDA also proposes to permit an AO to voluntarily withdraw its approval or otherwise cease operations as an AO under this part, but it must inform FDA of any facilities with pending inspections (see proposed \u00a7 205.33(l)). To further ensure that pending inspections are not overlooked, under FDA's proposed regulation, an AO whose approval has been suspended or revoked has the responsibility to report this information to those wholesale distributors that have pending inspections (see proposed \u00a7 205.33(m)); this will stop the clock on the 90-day licensure review while the wholesale distributor applies for inspection from another AO or FDA. Also, to ensure wholesale distributors continue to comply with the provisions of this part, and to ensure that AOs remain able to assess compliance with the wholesale distributor requirements, an AO must inform FDA of any changes to information that was submitted as part of its application for approval (see proposed \u00a7 205.33(n)(1)). Since the approval of an organization is nontransferable, changes in ownership require an AO to submit a new application to FDA (see proposed \u00a7 205.33(n)(2)). Finally, as an additional assurance that an AO continues to comply with the provisions of this part, FDA proposes to require that AOs remain subject to periodic audits by FDA (see proposed \u00a7 205.33(o)). VI. Proposed Effective/Compliance Dates Section 584 of the FD&C Act states that the national licensing standards for 3PLs established by regulation take effect 1 year after the date such final regulation is published (section 584(d)(1) and (3) of the FD&C Act), and that national licensing standards for wholesale distributors established by regulation take effect 2 years after the date such final regulation is published (section 583(a) and (e)(3) of the FD&C Act). For several reasons, FDA does not intend to enforce the 3PL requirements until 2 years after the final regulation is published. FDA recognizes that 1 year may be insufficient time for States to implement 3PL licensure programs, should they decide to implement such programs, and for 3PLs to apply for licensure under these programs. Setting up a state licensure program may require additional time. This is especially true in States that will require State legislative action to implement a licensure program, with some State legislatures only meeting biennially. As the DSCSA states that the national standards for prescription drug wholesale distributors established by regulation pursuant to section 583 of the FD&C Act will take effect 2 years after the date such final regulation is published (section 583(a) and (e) of the FD&C Act), the national standards for licensing wholesale distributors in subpart C will be effective 2 years after the date the final rule is published. Although the DSCSA states that the national licensing standards for 3PLs established by regulation pursuant to section 584 of the FD&C Act will take effect one year after the date such final regulation is published (section 584(d)(1) and (3) of the FD&C Act), as noted, FDA does not intend to enforce requirements with respect to the national standards for licensure of 3PLs until 2 years after the regulation is finalized, in order to provide States with the opportunity to establish or modify their licensure programs in accordance with the new standards and time for 3PLs to apply and obtain a new license. For 1 year after the effective date of the final regulation, FDA also does not intend to enforce the requirements of section 582(b)(3), (c)(3), (d)(3), and (e)(3) of the FD&C Act with respect to a manufacturer, wholesale distributor, dispenser, or repackager who has as a trading partner a 3PL that is not licensed, unless the 3PL is not licensed because the Secretary or a state licensing body has made a finding that the 3PL does not utilize good handling and distribution practices and the Secretary has published notice thereof. VII. Preliminary Economic Analysis of Impacts We have examined the impacts of the proposed rule under Executive Order 12866, Executive Order 13563, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4). Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct us to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity). We believe that this proposed rule is a significant regulatory action as defined by Executive Order 12866. The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires us to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant impact of a rule on small entities. Because the proposed rule could impose significant, although uncertain, new economic burdens on small entities, we find that the proposed rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (section 202(a)) requires us to prepare a written statement, which includes an assessment of anticipated costs and benefits, before proposing VerDate Sep<11>2014 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 24 / Friday, February 4, 2022 / Proposed Rules ''any rule that includes any Federal mandate that may result in the expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100,000,000 or more (adjusted annually for inflation) in any one year.'' The current threshold after adjustment for inflation is $158 million, using the most current (2020) Implicit Price Deflator for the Gross Domestic Product. This proposed rule would not result in an expenditure in any year that meets or exceeds this amount. In this rulemaking, we propose new national standards for the licensing of prescription drug wholesale distributors and third-party logistics providers as directed under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, Title II of the Drug Quality and Security Act. If finalized, the rule would also establish a Federal licensing system for wholesale drug distributors and third-party logistics providers to use in the absence of a state licensure program that is consistent with the proposed national standards. This rulemaking is being published in conjunction with the proposed rule entitled ''Certain Requirements Regarding Prescription Drug Marketing'' (or part 203), published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register . We include the benefits and costs of part 203 in this economic analysis and, unless otherwise specified, references to the ''proposed rule'' in this analysis encompass both proposed rules. We summarize the benefits and costs of the proposed rule in table 1. The standards for prescription drug wholesale distribution in the proposed rule would result in benefits to consumers and benefits to distributors from reducing the diversion of prescription drugs. Other monetized benefits include cost savings from reducing the frequency and quantity of licensure applications and cost savings from reducing state licensing standards in some states. We estimate that the annualized benefits over 10 years would range from $1.25 million to $31.50 million at a 7 percent discount rate, with a primary estimate of $10.66 million. We estimate that the annualized benefits would range from $1.26 million to $32.18 million at a 3 percent discount rate, with a primary estimate of $10.89 million. We also expect that the proposed rule, if finalized, would impose costs on wholesale drug distributors, third-party logistics providers, states, approved organizations, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Costs to wholesale drug distributors and third- party logistics providers include costs of learning about the rule, reporting to FDA, undergoing routine inspections, writing and revising standard operating procedures, and conducting background checks. Wholesale-drug distributors would also incur costs to furnish surety bonds to their state licensing authority to obtain or renew their licenses. Costs to states include the time spent reading and understanding the rule, passing or revising the laws and regulations governing their licensure programs, and inspecting WDD and 3PL facilities. Approved organizations would incur legal, application, and training costs, as well as costs to inspect WDD and 3PL facilities. FDA costs include the costs to establish and operate a reporting database and a licensure program for wholesale drug distributors and third-party logistics providers and the costs to establish and operate an approval program for approved organizations. We estimate that the annualized costs over 10 years would range from $13.21 million to $20.63 million at a 7 percent discount rate, with a primary estimate of $16.92 million. We estimate that the annualized costs over 10 years at a 3 percent discount rate would range from $12.83 million to $20.10 million, with a primary estimate of $16.47 million.

We have developed a comprehensive Preliminary Economic Analysis of Impacts (PRIA) that assesses the impacts of the proposed rule. The full preliminary analysis of economic impacts is available in the docket for this proposed rule (Ref 18) and at Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 24 / Friday, February 4, 2022 / Proposed Rules VIII. Analysis of Environmental Impacts FDA has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action and has concluded, under 21 CFR 25.30(h), that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. IX. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 This proposed rule contains information collection provisions that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3521). A description of these provisions is given in the Description section of this document with an estimate of the annual reporting, recordkeeping, and third- party disclosure burden. Included in the estimate is the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing each collection of information. FDA invites comments on these topics: (1) Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of FDA's functions, including whether the information will have practical utility; (2) the accuracy of FDA's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (4) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on respondents, including through the use of automated collection techniques, when appropriate, and other forms of information technology. Title: Requirements to Obtain a License to Distribute Drugs, Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping for Procedures, for Third-Party Logistics Providers and Prescription Drug Wholesale Distributors to Obtain a License to Distribute Drugs; 21 CFR part 205; OMB Control Number 0910-0251\u2014 Reinstatement Description: The proposed rule would establish standards, terms, and conditions for the licensing of 3PLs and prescription drug wholesale distributors by State or Federal licensing authorities, including process for the revocation, reissuance, and renewal of such licenses. Sections 584 and 583 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360eee-3, 360eee- 2)) as added by the DSCSA (Title II of Pub. L. 113-54) requires FDA to issue regulations on national standards for the licensing of 3PLs and wholesale distributors. Accordingly, FDA is proposing requirements for licensing of wholesale distributors and third-party logistics providers. The proposed rule outlines these requirements, including information collection provisions, that 3PLs and wholesale distributors must meet to obtain a license. The licensing authority is the State, from which the 3PLs distribute drug or the State from which wholesale distributors distribute drug. However, if a State does not establish the licensure programs for 3PLs or wholesale distributors consistent with these regulations, FDA will issue the licenses to 3PLs or wholesale distributors in that State. In addition, States may require that a 3PL or a wholesale distributor obtain a license to ship drugs into that State. The FD&C Act does not require that States issue these types of licenses. However, if a State chooses to implement such a licensure requirement, the State must ensure that it is consistent with these regulations, and any wholesale distributor or 3PL wishing to ship products into that State must have a license. Proposed part 205, subpart A, would set forth the national licensing standards for State and Federal licenses issued to 3PLs pursuant to section 584 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360eee-3). Proposed part 205, subpart C, would set forth the national licensing standards for State and Federal licenses issued to wholesale distributors pursuant to sections 503(e) and 583 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 353(e) and 21 U.S.C. 360eee- 2)) and replaces the existing regulations in proposed part 205 that outlined guidelines for State licensing of wholesale distributors that were developed under the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100- 293). In addition, the FD&C Act, as amended by DSCSA, allows FDA to approve ''third party accreditation'' entities to evaluate the qualifications of 3PLs for licensure or inspect wholesale distributors facilities on behalf of FDA. These organizations are referred to in this proposed rule as approved organizations or ''AOs.'' The application to become an AO is the same whether the AO will be evaluating the qualifications of 3PLs for licensure, inspecting wholesale distributors facilities, or both. Subparts B and D of the proposed rule outline the qualifications for AOs to perform licensure reviews/inspections for 3PL facilities and inspections of wholesale distributors respectively. Description of Respondents: Respondents to the information collection are third-party logistics providers and wholesale distributors in any State and any entity engaging in wholesale distribution of prescription drugs in any State. We are proposing that these respondents submit applications for licensure and maintain records of procedures and documents pertaining to licensure review, inspections, policies, and training. The DSCSA establishes 3PLs as members of the drug supply chain, which are distinct from wholesale drug distributors, and specifically precludes States from regulating 3PLs as wholesale distributors (section 585(b)(2) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360eee-4(b)(2)). FDA is required by section 584 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360eee-3) to establish national standards for the licensure of 3PLs and is proposing those standards in part 205, subpart A. When the proposed rule is finalized, we will require that each facility of an entity that meets the definition of a 3PL in section 581(22) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360eee(22)) be licensed by the State or FDA in accordance with the standards articulated in proposed part 205, subpart A. Proposed part 205, subpart C, of the proposed rule, \u00a7\u00a7 205.20 through 205.30, establishes the national standards for the licensure of wholesale drug distributors. When the proposed rule is finalized, we will require that each wholesale distributor be licensed by the State or FDA in accordance with the standards in proposed part 205, subpart C. Proposed part 205, subpart B (\u00a7\u00a7 and subpart D (\u00a7\u00a7 205.31 through 205.33), of the proposed rule describe the content requirements, application process, and reporting schedules to become an approved organization to conduct licensure review/inspections for 3PL facilities or conduct inspections of wholesale distributors. Although the work differs among licensure review and inspection for 3PLs and wholesale distributors, FDA believes that the same entities will apply to conduct licensure reviews and inspection of both types of entities. In addition, the submission of an application to become an AO is the same in subparts B and D. Because of this, we are combining the discussions of AOs for 3PLs and wholesale distributors, and the resulting burden estimates. The national licensure standards FDA is proposing are intended to help ensure that the supply chain remains secure and that those finished prescription drug products subject to the DSCSA moving through the supply chain are properly stored, handled, and transported. These measures are VerDate Sep<11>2014 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 24 / Friday, February 4, 2022 / Proposed Rules intended to help protect U.S. consumers from drugs that may be counterfeit, stolen, contaminated, or otherwise harmful. The required information collection to comply with the proposed rule is necessary for the States or FDA to assess the ability of 3PLs or wholesale distributors to properly maintain drug quality and security while the drug products are under their possession or control. We estimate the burden of the information collection as follows: TABLE 3\u2014E STIMATED ANNUAL REPORTING BURDEN1 Proposed 21 CFR part 205 section; IC activity Number of respondents Number of responses per respondent Total annual responses Average burden per response (in hours) Total hours Subpart A (3PLs): \u00a7\u00a7 205.5 and 205.6; application and 459 2 918 \u00a7 205.7; changes to licensure ....................................... 6 1 6 1 6 \u00a7 205.8; expiry and renewal of licensure ...................... 149 1 149 \u00a7 205.9; denials, suspensions, reinstatements, revoca- tions ........................................................................... 1 35 \u00a7 205.11; personnel list ................................................. 459 1 459 .5 230 \u00a7 205.15; annual reports ............................................... 459 1 459 .25 115 Subpart B (Approved Organizations for 3PLs): \u00a7 205.17; licensure review and inspection reports of 3PL facilities .............................................................. 6 15 90 5 450 \u00a7 205.19; applications, denials, revocations, suspen- sions, renewals, reinstatements for AO status ......... 6 Subpart C (WDD Standards): \u00a7\u00a7 205.22 ........................ 39 1 39 1 39 \u00a7 205.26; confirmation of theft or loss of Rx drug ........ 25 1 25 .5 13 \u00a7\u00a7 205.29 and 205.30; denials, suspensions, rein- statements, revisions, and terminations\u2014requests for hearing ................................................................. 38 1 38 1 38 \u00a7 annual reports ............................... 1,951 1 WDDs): \u00a7\u00a7 205.32 and 205.33; documentation of qualifications and disclosures to FDA ............................................. 6 31 186 5 930 Total ....................................................................... ........................ ........................ 5,8 90 ........................ ........................ 1There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs associated with the information collection.

Reporting Burden Among the reporting requirements found in proposed part 205 are content and format provisions pertaining to issuance, changes, expiry, renewal, and annual reports for 3PLs, as well as WDDs, as reflected above in table 3. The proposed regulations also prescribe procedural steps and reporting schedules for submitting information regarding licensure, changes to VerDate Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 24 / Friday, February 4, 2022 / Proposed Rules licensure, reinstatement, and annual reporting, including requisite reporting timeframes. Consistent with our PRIA, we estimate that 459 3PL facilities and 1,951 WDDs will become subject to the reporting requirements described in proposed part 205, where we ascribe specific burden associated with the provisions found in table 3. Because we currently lack specific submission data regarding the proposed reporting requirements, we rely on our experience with similar information collection as the primary basis for our estimates. However, we invite specific comment from potential respondents regarding burden estimates we ascribe to the reporting elements found in the proposed regulations, along with a discussion of the basis for their computation. Recordkeeping Burden As set forth in the proposed regulations, 3PLs and WDDs must maintain records documenting procedures, management practice, policies, training, and personnel, among others. Under proposed \u00a7 205.4, all records are subject to FDA inspection and must be made available upon request in the format prescribed by the proposed regulations. Additional specific recordkeeping practice elements are also enumerated in the proposed regulations. Consistent with our PRIA, we estimate that 459 3PLs and 1,951 WDDs will become subject to these requirements, if the proposed rule is finalized. These provisions are reflected above in table 4, along with an estimated number of annual records and recordkeeping hours we attribute to the corresponding activity. As with the proposed reporting requirements, we currently lack specific data regarding recordkeeping associated with the proposed regulations. We invite specific comment from potential respondents regarding burden estimates we ascribe to the recordkeeping activities, along with a discussion of the basis for their computation. To ensure that comments on information collection are received, OMB recommends that written comments be submitted through reginfo.gov (see ADDRESSES ). All comments should be identified with the title of the information collection. In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3407(d)), we have submitted the information collection provisions of this proposed rule to OMB for review. These information collection requirements will not be effective until FDA publishes a final rule, OMB approves the information collection requirements, and the rule goes into effect. FDA will announce OMB approval of these requirements in the Federal Register . X. Federalism We have analyzed this proposed rule in accordance with the principles set forth in Executive Order 13132, ''Federalism'' (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999). This Executive order sets forth principles and criteria that agencies must adhere to in formulating and implementing policies that have federalism implications, defined in section 1(a) of the order as including regulations that have ''substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.'' Section 4(a) of the Executive order requires agencies to ''construe . . . a Federal statute to preempt State law only where the statute contains an express preemption provision or there is some other clear evidence that the Congress intended preemption of State law, or where the exercise of State authority conflicts with the exercise of Federal authority under the Federal statute.'' The DSCSA added to the FD&C Act an express preemption provision under section 585, which addresses state licensure of WDDs and 3PLs in section 585(b)(1). A. Scope of Preemption FDA interprets section 585(b)(1) of the FD&C Act as preempting States and localities from establishing or continuing requirements for 3PL or WDD licensure that are different from the standards and requirements applicable under sections 584 and amended 503(e) of the FD&C Act. In other words, States and local governments may not establish or continue licensure requirements for 3PLs or WDDs unless those State requirements are the same as Federal requirements; different requirements are preempted. As noted above, a draft guidance issued in October 2014 (Ref. 4) proposed a different preemption interpretation under which States and localities could impose requirements on 3PL and WDD licensure that were different from Federal requirements so long as those requirements did not fall below the minimum Federal standards. Several stakeholders commented that the agency's interpretation of section 585(b)(1) was too narrow. Instead, they argued Congress intended to preempt all state licensure laws not identical to Federal licensure standards, i.e., that Congress wanted the Federal system to provide both a ''floor'' and a ''ceiling'' when it came to the issue of preemption. FDA has reconsidered its earlier proposed interpretation and determined that its current interpretation\u2014that the Federal requirements will establish both a ''floor'' and a ''ceiling''\u2014is more consistent with the language of the statute, Congressional purpose, and policy considerations. Section 585(b)(1) provides for the preemption of any state requirements that are, among other things, ''inconsistent with'' or ''covered by'' Federal requirements\u2014which suggests both a floor and a ceiling. Furthermore, the fundamental purpose of the DSCSA provisions was to strengthen the security and integrity of the drug supply chain through uniform national requirements (Refs 2, 3, 18), including with respect to licensure (see e.g., section 583(b)). In contrast, under the interpretation proposed in our October 2014 draft guidance, 3PLs and WDDs could be required to comply with a patchwork of State and local licensure requirements, which would undermine the goal of national uniformity and could create barriers to the statute's implementation and administrability. That approach would not create the intended uniformity in national policy because States and localities would not be preempted from establishing unique or disparate requirements. Accordingly, FDA is withdrawing, as of the date of publication of this proposed rule, that portion of the October 2014 draft guidance addressing preemption with respect to WDD/3PL licensure. B. Effective Date of Preemption Section 585(b)(1) provides that it is effective ''[b]eginning on the date of enactment of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act [November 27, 2013].'' However, that provision applies only to state requirements that are inconsistent with the national standards and requirements applicable under sections 584 and 503(e) of the FD&C Act. Those national standards will be established by this regulation, once finalized and effective. Thus, by its very terms, section 585(b)(1) has no current application. Accordingly, State and local licensure requirements will be preempted only once this regulation, when finalized, takes effect; until such time, current State and local licensing of WDDs and 3PLs may continue. We believe that this result is dictated by the terms of the statute. However, even if the statute were considered ambiguous, this interpretation is consistent with the statutory framework and purposes. Other provisions added VerDate Sep<11>2014 Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 24 / Friday, February 4, 2022 / Proposed Rules by the DSCSA recognized state licensure of WDDs and 3PLs before the effective date of this regulation. For example, DSCSA requires both WDDs and 3PLs to report their state licensure, beginning January 1, 2015, for WDDs and November 27, 2014, for 3PLs (see sections 503(e)(2)(A) and section 584(b)). Because these reporting requirements apply during the period between DSCSA's enactment and the effective date of Federal licensing standards, they suggest that Congress intended to preserve the status quo in terms of permitting state licensure during this interim period. Indeed, if state licensing were viewed as preempted during this interim period, there could be no valid state licensure for 3PLs and WDDs to report, rendering this reporting provision meaningless. In addition, section 582(a)(6) expressly recognizes state WDD licensure during the period between DSCSA's enactment and the effective date of Federal licensure regulations, and section 582(a)(7) similarly deems 3PLs to be ''licensed'' during this time, including by acknowledging and accommodating state licensure of 3PLs. Further, the WDD licensure rules take effect two years after publication of the final rule, per section 583(e)(3), and the 3PL rules take effect one year after publication of the final rule, per section 584(d)(3)(C). Thus, despite the reference to DSCSA's enactment date in section 585(b)(1), the statute also expressly provides that the Federal licensure standards will not be effective until several years after DSCSA's enactment. The interpretation is also supported by reading the provisions of a statute as an integrated whole, consistent with its fundamental purpose. As noted, the purpose is to strengthen the security and integrity of the drug supply chain through uniform national requirements, including with respect to licensure. This purpose would be frustrated if the statute were implemented in a manner that could lead to supply chain disruption, due to licensing uncertainties, while the national licensure standards are pending. Thus, Congress included in the DSCSA provisions which recognize state licensure of WDDs and 3PLs prior to the effective date of Federal licensing standards. If preemption under section 585(b)(1) were construed to preempt states from continuing to license WDDs and 3PLs even before Federal standards are in place, there could be confusion whether these supply chain entities have valid licensure, to the detriment of supply chain operations. Accordingly, we believe that read as a whole, the statute can be reasonably interpreted as providing for preemption to apply only upon the effective date of this regulation, once finalized. XI. Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal Governments We have analyzed this proposed rule in accordance with the principles set forth in Executive Order 13175. We have tentatively determined that the rule does not contain policies that would have a substantial direct effect on one or more Indian Tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian Tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian Tribes. The Agency solicits comments from tribal officials on any potential impact on Indian Tribes from this proposed action. XII.

(a) This applies to the licensure of third-party logistics providers (3PLs) in any State and to any entity engaging in wholesale distribution of prescription drugs in any State. The standards established under subpart A of this part will apply to all State and Federal licenses described under sections 503(e)(5) and 584 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 353(e)(5) and 360eee-3). The standards established under subpart C of this part will apply to all State and Federal licenses described under sections 503(e)(1) and 583 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 353(e)(1) and 360eee-2). (b) A facility or entity that conducts 3PL activities must obtain a 3PL license for each facility as described in this part and is not required to obtain a license as a wholesale distributor unless it is also conducting wholesale distribution activities, in which case, the entity or facility must obtain both a 3PL license as described in subpart A of this part and a wholesale distributor license as described in subpart C of this part. Unless otherwise noted, the term ''3PL'' or ''third-party logistics provider'' in this part applies to both the entity and the individual facilities requiring a license. (c) Subpart B of this part applies to any third-party organization seeking to obtain or maintain approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency) to evaluate the qualifications of 3PLs for licensure. Subpart D of this part applies to any third-party organization seeking to obtain or maintain approval by the Food and Drug Administration to conduct inspections of wholesale distributors. \u00a7 205.2 Purpose. The purpose of this part is to establish standards, terms, and conditions for the licensing of 3PLs and prescription drug wholesale distributors by State or Federal licensing authorities, including a process for the revocation, reissuance, and renewal of such licenses.

On the renewal application provided by the State or Federal licensing authority, the 3PL must: (1) Certify that the 3PL has continued to meet all the standards and complied with the requirements in this subpart since the previous license was issued; and (2) Inform the applicable licensing authority of any changes to information previously submitted pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section or \u00a7 205.6(a)(2) for which a notification was not already submitted to the licensing authority under \u00a7 205.7. \u00a7 205.6 Federal licensure process. (a) Procedures for filing an FDA application for a 3PL license. (1) Each 3PL facility must electronically submit an application to the Food and Drug Administration for a license to conduct 3PL activities in a State if the State does not have a 3PL licensure program consistent with the standards set forth in this section. The application must include the information specified in \u00a7 205.5, along with supporting documentation that demonstrates the applicant's storage practices are sufficient to ensure the continued safety, identity, strength, quality, and purity of the products in the facility. (2) If one or more organizations have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration to conduct a review of a 3PL's qualifications for licensure pursuant to \u00a7 205.17, the 3PL will indicate in its application to the Food and Drug Administration which approved organization (AO) it prefers to conduct its licensure review. If there is no organization approved by the Food and Drug Administration to conduct licensure review, the Food and Drug Administration will conduct the review, as described in \u00a7 205.17(b). Licensure review must consist of: (i) Review of all documents submitted in support of the application for 3PL licensure; and (ii) Inspection of the facility, as directed by the licensing authority pursuant to \u00a7 205.16(a) or (b). (3) The applicant, or the applicant's agent or other authorized official, must sign the application. (4) An application for a 3PL license will not be considered as filed until the Food and Drug Administration has received all pertinent information and fees. (b) Determination that licensing requirements have been met. The Food and Drug Administration, not an AO, will determine whether the 3PL meets all the applicable requirements set forth in this part. (c) Notification of easily correctable deficiencies. The Food and Drug Administration will make every reasonable effort to promptly communicate to applicants easily correctable deficiencies found in an application when those deficiencies are discovered, particularly deficiencies concerning storage, handling, distribution, or recordkeeping issues.

(d) Issuance of 3PL license by FDA. Approval of a 3PL license application or issuance of a 3PL license constitutes a determination by the Food and Drug Administration that, based upon the information provided and reviewed, the 3PL meets the applicable requirements to be licensed under section 584 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Food and Drug Administration will approve an application and send the applicant an approval letter and license certificate if none of the reasons in \u00a7 205.9(a)(1) for refusing to approve the application applies. Applicable requirements for the maintenance of 3PL facilities to conduct 3PL activities will include but not be limited to the good storage practices set forth under \u00a7 205.10.

Also, the board should determine if it wants to hold a public hearing on the proposed regulati on changes at its next meeting. If it does, the location, date and time of the hearing needs to be included in the public notice. Publichearings are usually held in conjunction with a regularly-scheduled meeting of the board and are always recorded. Oral pu blic hearing is optional; however, answering the following questions will help the board determine if an oral public hearing is needed: xAre the regulations controversial and is there likely to be substantial public interest in them? xWould those most affected by the regulations be better able to participate if an oral hearing were held? xWould the board benefit from a face-t o-face or teleconferenced opportunity to receive comments on the proposed regulations from interested persons? \u0011 Regulations Specialist sends notice to Alas ka Dispatch News (or other newspapers if warranted) for publication, a ll interested parties, and licensees , if warranted. The Regulations Specialist posts the notice on the Alaska Online Public Notice System, electronicallytransmits a copy of the notice and proposed regulation changes to all incumbent legislatorsand the Legislative Affairs Agency, Ho use & Senate Labor & Commerce Committees, Legislative Council, Lt.

Comments received after the dead line should not be forwarded to the board and comments should not be taken at the board meeting from the public prior to adoption unless a hearing was noticed and the comments are heard by the board during the comment period. Adoption 12. The board's options regardin g the proposed regulation change s at its next meeting are: 343(Rev. 1/2\u001b\u0012\u0015\u0013\u0015\u0013 ) 3 a. It can adopt the proposed regulation chan ges as written/publicly noticed, amend, and adopt them; or b. Choose to take no action on them.c. Substantive changes may require addi tional drafting and public notice ( see Step 7 above). 13.

It may be expedited if a board meets often or holds a teleconference following the written comment period to adopt the final regulations. Department of Law workload also plays a big part in the timeframe. 2Board minutes reflecting concisely what the project entails plays an importa nt part in getting a project rolling. This is true for the initial st ages and the final motion adopting the regulations following the public comment period due to the rele vant minutes or an excerpt of the minutes being forwarded to the Department of Law with the final project. 345346347348349350351352353354355356357358359360361362363364365366367368Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development DIVISION OF CORPORATIONS, BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL LICENSING Juneau Office P.O.

State processes should not be a barrier to entering the workforce, and yet over the years an incredibly complex web of State Statutes and regulations has done just that.\" Administrative Order 335, available at gov.alaska.gov/admin-orders, urges state professional licensing boards to implement expedited temporary licensure measures and to identify outdated or ineffective regulations by the end of the summer. DCCED Commissioner Julie Sande stated, \"I am so grateful for Governor Dunleavy's support on this critical issue. The success of businesses throughout Alaska depends on our ability to quickly get folks out into the workplace. This issue is at the heart of our ability to grow our economy, strengthen communities, and protect consumers in Alaska. Empowering CBPL staff to focus on mission critical tasks will have an immediate impact on the backlog while staff work to continue to fill vacancies in key positions within the CBPL team. I also appreciate the understanding and cooperative approach that the licensing board members and staff have demonstrated as we work towards making right-touch regulatory changes.\" The mission of the Division of Corporations, Business, and Professional Licensing (CBPL) is to inspire public confidence through balanced regulation of competent professional and business services. CBPL is a division of the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development (DCCED). For more information on DCCED, visit www.commerce.alaska.gov . Come work with us!

Such agreements allow pharmacists to prescribe, administer, and treat a very limited set of conditions with pharmaceutical interventions. Examples include treatment for immunizati ons, emergency contraception, travel medication, and hypertension. HB 145 allows physicians/pharmacists to continue engaging in cooperative practice agreements but clarifies services pharmacists can independently provide for general wellness, di sease prevention, and drug uti lization services. This bill empowers the Board of Pharmacy to adopt regulations to ensu re these services remain within their existing practice authority and provides for the ability for ph armacists to bill for these services. Analysis/Recommendations: The existing process for reviewing, approving, and f ile maintenance of these ag reements is duplicative and administratively burdensome. Currently the Medical Board a nd Board of Pharmacy have separate forms and separate, highly detailed review processes which entail each board to independently review and endorse each plan. The following are recommendations to add ress these inefficiencies and streamline the Physician/Pharmacist cooperative practice agreement process: 1. Create one practice agreement form that both boards endorse 2. Adopt a reviewing protocol and procedure endorsed by both boards that ensures the Medical Board is primarily responsible for conducting the qualitative review of all practice agreement applications (based on a checklist comprised of the criteria outlined in 12 AA C 40.983) and decides whether the practice agreement may be approved or denied. Next the form is forwarded to the Board of Pharmacy administrative staff to be filed in the pharmacist's licensing file. x Note: to eliminate the Board of Pharmacy from ha ving the responsibility to dually approve practice agreements the Medical Board will need to revise regulation 12 AAC 40.983 (k). Next Steps: Person(s) Responsible Date Due: 1. The Medical Board and Board of Pharmacy EA's create new form and draft policy procedure for processing applications incl uding how denied requests may appeal or be offered an opportunity for a remediation plan. Laura & Natalie 4/30/2021 2. Introduce draft regulation change language at the May 13-14 Medical Board Meeting for review Natalie 5/13/2021 3. Identify, draft and introduce any regulatory clean-up language needed by the Board of Pharmacy for example, the Medical Board would request the name of the plans be changed to \"Physician/Pharmacist Cooperative Practice Agreement\" instead of \"Pharmacist Collaborative Practice Agreement\"/ Laura 4. Submit a work order to changes to be ma de to the Portal for how Cooperative Agreements are tracked. Laura 417PPolicyy && Natalie Norberg Initial Review/Approval: 1. Cooperative Practice Agreement on Form 08- 4410 is submitted to the State Medical Board. 2. Assigned OLE will create a record in Portal using pr ogram = Medical and License Type = Cooperative Practice Agreement. 3. State Medical Board or its designee reviews/approves th e agreement and copy of protocol per checklist #OL-720. 4. If approved, Medical Board EA updates the checklis t and keeps the Portal record as 'In-Process' 5. Pharmacy Board EA reviews in-process cooperative ag reement records monthly for MED approval. If approved, Board of Pharmacy EA endorses, completes the ch ecklist, and saves the record as 'Active' 6. Assigned OLE will mail a copy of approved agre ement and approval letter to the address on record. Timelines: 1. Agreements should be reviewed monthly via 2. The Board of Pharmacy or its EA will review/approve e ndorsement within 2 - 4 weeks of approval by the State Medical Board/EA. Denied Requests/Appeals: If the board is not satisfied that the pharmacist has been adeq uately trained to engage in the protocol(s), the board will specify additional trainings that mu st be completed prior to endorsement of/engaging in the protocol.
