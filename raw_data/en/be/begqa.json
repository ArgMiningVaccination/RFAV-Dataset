The goals of traditional chiropractic are: - Decreasing muscle spasm - Increasing range of motion - Temporarily reduce your pain This is what most chiropractors offer in the way of care. We believe most of these doctors do a great job. There are some chiropractors who continue their education through additional certifications and coursework, allowing them to focus on other areas of chiropractic. One of those areas is called NeuroStructural Correction. A chiropractor who focuses on NeuroStructural Correction is looking to correct neurological & structural abnormalities in the spine. NeuroStructural Chiropractic Think of your spine as the foundation for a building. If your house was not sitting properly on its foundation, would you expect the floors to creak, the walls to crack, and windows to work smoothly or not so smoothly? Now you can spend time patching all the secondary effects from the shift in the foundation, but you would be doing so with the expectation that in a short time the problems will have to be.....? ....Repaired Again....and Again.... In the vast majority of patients that find a way to our office, the issue is a significant Structural Shift. These patients are often referred to us by medical doctors and even other chiropractors because of the uniqueness of what we do. The Structural Shifts are the underlying causes that often reveal themselves as \"symptoms\" - or what we refer to as Secondary Conditions. NeuroStructural Correction focuses exclusively on the correction of the underlying cause - Abnormal Nerve Function & Structural Shifts. "}
