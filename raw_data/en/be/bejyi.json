NutritionInsight takes a closer look at the clean label supplements arena, its subtrends and latest innovations. \"By now, clean label is not so much a trend as a movement that encompasses a complex, nuanced set of consumer values and ideals,\" explains Stephane Vouche, marketing manager for Lonza capsules and health ingredients. The trend has converged with other global mega-trends, such as the desire to live more sustainably and the pursuit of wellness. Most consumers now prefer responsible solutions and believe they can make a difference to the planet with their purchasing decisions, Vouche notes. \"Clean label satisfies consumers' desire for healthy options. Today's consumers aspire to a healthier lifestyle, from the environment they live, into what they eat. This ends up directly affecting the supplement industry,\" affirms N\u00faria Jim\u00e9nez, marketing specialist for Lubrizol Life Science's (LLS) nutraceuticals division. It is an absolutely still relevant trend with an interesting new twist, according to Jaclyn Bowen, executive director for Clean Label Project - an award program based on food and consumer product safety issues. \"Because of corporate apathy and government inaction, consumers are taking it upon themselves to be the new arbiters of truth, transparency and safety. This is especially true for mothers who are taking it upon themselves to do the research behind brands, products and ingredients,\" Bowen says. Evolving with the times Vouche explains that as clean label is now mainstream, food supplement producers must further understand how to address global consumer needs on a broader and deeper level. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers are paying more attention to their health and what they put in their bodies. They are highly-informed and value-driven, looking for solutions that can support a range of health priorities, while also meeting the highest standards of quality and sustainable production. \"As such, the food supplements market has encountered a new point of need and focus that is driving innovation. Combination products that leverage the benefits of multiple complementary ingredients and offer additional or synergistic health benefits in a single dosage form are therefore becoming increasingly popular,\" Vouche underlines. However, Bowen continues to see a growing divide between policymakers and the consumers, both in the marketplace and in mainstream media. There are ingredients, processes and chemicals of concern that are permitted for use in food and consumer product regulatory policy. \"However, just because something is permitted by regulation, it doesn't mean that it is considered acceptable by consumers. From our perspective, brands should view compliance with federal food safety laws as table stakes, but align their goals with evolving consumer expectations of safety and quality,\" she adds. Dosage forms adapt to trends The latest innovations in dosage forms are key for brands to deliver on the clean label trend, while also enabling a solution that is transparently and responsibly made from start to finish, explains Vouche. \"At Lonza we're seeing a growing demand for plant-based dosage form solutions with cleaner labels. These support unique ingredient combinations, enabling consumers to live better in the way that matters most to them as individuals.\" \"That might be through better sleep, which could be supported by a combination of lavender oil and powdered saffron in a single dosage form, enabled by Lonza's vegan Duocap capsule-in-capsule technology, and tinted lavender with edible purple carrot.\" \"Or it might be through looking as good as they feel - achieved by science-backed, plant-based skin and hair health ingredients delivered in Lonza's Licaps vegetarian liquid-filled hard capsules, with advanced fusion sealing technology for reassuring stability,\" Vouch says. LLS's pipeline is constantly being updated to meet its customers' needs and trends in the health industry, according to Jim\u00e9nez. \"Since we saw that there was a trend toward natural products, we launched Astagile microcapsules, a stable and natural astaxanthin with proven cognitive effects,\" she highlights. The company has also introduced Curcushine microcapsules, a soluble and bioavailable microencapsulated curcumin with proven anti-aging benefits. Innovating in supplements NPD Ingredients are often viewed as commodities with no real difference among them, supports Bowen. However, where an ingredient comes from, how it's grown and the quality of the soil can affect the product safety and quality. \"Brands are increasingly recognizing how ingredients affect their finished product quality and are re-examining their supplier assurance and ingredient sourcing policies to make sure they are sourcing the best ingredients.\" \"I would highlight this new take on 'preventive controls' within hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) systems as opposed to an individual ingredient to spotlight,\" she says. Potential in dosage forms Lonza sees a lot of untapped potential within dosage form solutions, which may offer brands an opportunity to deliver clean label ingredients while offering full traceability for consumers who want the reassurance of conscious quality. \"We're innovating with polymers to bring greater versatility to the clean-label capsule experience and create a new generation of plant-based capsule essentials,\" continues Vouche. For example, the pullulan used in its patented, Plantcaps capsules is produced using a sustainably cultivated source of manioc (cassava), which undergoes a process of natural microbial fermentation. These capsules offer gelatin-like performance and a superior oxygen barrier while providing the safety, transparent sourcing and quality credentials that today's consumers desire, he notes. \"Meanwhile, we also continue to add to our specialized capsule portfolio - for example, by brightening up clean-label capsules with color.\" Hypromellose (HPMC) Vcaps Plus capsules can now be tinted in a variety of shades derived from coloring foods. These are obtained from edible fruit or vegetables and do not require an E number, thus opening up opportunities for both brand differentiation and ingredient masking, Vouche adds. Trends to expect Transparency will be one of the most important factors regarding future supplement products as consumers want to be informed and see ingredients they recognize on the labels, notes Jim\u00e9nez. For Bowen, increased transparency will dominate the space. \"The use of QR codes have been around for a while in the food space. The CBD industry was quick to embrace QR codes to link consumers to test results.\" \"I see the use of QR codes as key for not only the sharing of test results but also in sharing the details of where ingredients come from. Given the global nature of dietary supplement supply chains, consumers want to know more about the farms and facilities making the supplements that they consume every day,\" she flags. Meanwhile, Vouche focalizes customized crafting and unique experiences that offer versatile, flexible solutions for common health priorities. \"For consumers, the greatest value lies in a solution that feels tailor-made to their needs. For manufacturers, it's an exciting opportunity to demonstrate an understanding of those requirements and to offer a range of solutions in anticipation,\" he concludes.
