Butler, J. Bradley Layton, Vikas R. Dharnidharka, John M. Sahrmann, Marissa J. Seamans, David J. Weber, and Leah J. McGrath Rationale & Objective: Studies of patients on maintenance dialysis therapy suggest that standard-dose in fluenza vaccine (SDV) may not prevent in fluenza-related outcomes. Little is known about the comparative effectiveness of SDV versus high-dose in fluenza vaccine (HDV) in this population. Study Design: Cohort study using data from the US Renal Data System. Setting & Participants: 507 ,552 adults under- going in-center maintenance hemodialysis between the 2010 to 2011 and 2014 to 2015 influenza seasons. Exposures: SDV and HDV. Outcomes: All-cause mortality, hospitalization due to in fluenza or pneumonia, and in fluenza-like illness during the in fluenza season. Analytic Approach: Patients were eligible for in- clusion in multiple yearly cohorts; thus, our unit ofanalysis was the in fluenza patient-season. To examine the relationship between vaccine dose and effectiveness outcomes, we estimated risk differences and risk ratios using propensity score weighting of Kaplan-Meier functions, accounting for a wide range of patient- and facility-level characteristics. For nonmortality outcomes, we used competing-risk methods toaccount for the high mortality rate in the dialysis population. Results: Within 225,215 in fluenza patient- seasons among adults 65 and older, 97.4 %received SDV and 2.6 %received HDV. We observed similar risk estimates for HDV and SDV recipients for mortality (risk difference, 0.08%;9 5 %CI, 0.85%to 0.80%), hospitalization due to in fluenza or pneumonia (risk difference, 0.15 %;9 5 % CI,0.69%to 0.93 %), and in difference, 0.00 %;9 5%CI,1.50%to 1.08%). Our ndings were similar among adults younger than 65 years, as well as within other subgroups de ned by in fluenza season, age group, dialysis vintage, month of in fluenza vaccination, and vaccine valence. Limitations: Residual confounding and outcome misclassi cation. Conclusions: The HDV does not appear to provide additional protection beyond the SDV against all-cause mortality or in fluenza-related outcomes for adults und ergoing hemodialysis. The additional cost and side effects associated with HDV should be considered when offering this vaccine. Future studies of HDV and other in fluenza vaccine strategies are warranted. Influenza causes substantial morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Patients with ESRD have an impaired innate and adaptive immunesystem, including defects in complement activation and B-and T-cell function, 1-3which contribute to increased risks for severe complications from influenza or influenza- related hospitalizations, mortality, and health care costs compared to the general population.4-7The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has long recom-mended that patients with ESRD receive annual influenzavaccinations. 8,9 Currently, several types of influenza vaccines are avail- able in the United States, including the standard-dose(SDV) and high-dose influenza vaccines have been administered as standard practice indialysis clinics. In 2009, the US Food and Drug Adminis-tration licensed a trivalent HDV for use among adults 65years and older to induce higher antibody responses andprovide better protection from influenza than the SDV. 10 The HDV contains the same 3 strains as SDV but more antigen (60 vs 15 g per strain) than standard vaccines. Use of the HDV among patients on maintenance hemo-dialysis has increased slowly over time. 11 An accumulating body of literature demonstrates that the HDV is more effective than SDVs in preventing influenza- related medical encounters, hospitalizations, and mortalityin the general population of adults 65 years and older. 12-18 However, some studies of healthy older adults have notdemonstrated a benet of HDV. 19,20In the dialysis popula- tion, recent observational study by Miskulin et al21reported that HDV was more effective than SDV in preventing all-causehospitalization during the 2016 to 2017 influenza season, but not the 2015 to 2016 season. However, this study was limited by small sample size, adjustment for a small set ofpotential confounders, and the absence of influenza-relatedoutcomes, warranting additional examination of the effec-tiveness of the HDV in the dialysis population.Complete author and article information provided before references.

Because thehealthy-user effect and frailty are well-documented chal-lenges of observational studies of influenza vaccine effec-tiveness in populations with poor health, we used robustmethods to account for possible confounding. We also used competing-risk methods to account for the high mortality rate in the dialysis population. Methods Data Source We used the US Renal Data System (USRDS) to identify patients with chronic kidney disease receiving in-centermaintenance hemodialysis during 2009 to 2015. USRDSis a national registry of patients with ESRD who are eligible for Medicare coverage from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and it contains routinely re-ported clinical information from dialysis centers, as well asMedicare claims for inpatient, outpatient, and physiciandiagnoses and procedures. 22 Study Design and Patients We constructed yearly cohorts for 5 individual influenza seasons: 2010 to 2011, 2011 to 2012, 2012 to 2013, 2013 to 2014, and 2014 to 2015. The index dates wereanchored on the date of influenza vaccination ( Fig 1 ), which was required to be administered before the startdate of the influenza season. Eligible patients includedadults 18 years or older with ESRD and Medicare as aprimary insurance payer who had started hemodialysis atleast 9 months before the index date, to allow for a 3- month Medicare enrollment period before the 6-month baseline period. We further required continuous hemo-dialysis receipt for the 3 months immediately beforevaccination. Baseline covariates were ascertained duringthe 6-month baseline period before the index date. Thefollow-up period began on the start date of the influenzaseason. The start and end dates of each influenza season were dened using national influenza surveillance data from the CDC. 23-27Specically, the start and end of each season were dened as the midpoint of the rst weekduring which >10% and <10%, respectively, of national culture isolates were positive for influenza ( Table S1 ). The primary analysis was conducted in adults 65 years andolder; a secondary analysis was conducted in adultsyounger than 65 years. Patients could be eligible for in- clusion in multiple yearly cohorts. Exposure Assessment Influenza vaccines were classied as HDV, SDV, or un- known ( Table S2 ), based on outpatient, physician, and inpatient procedure coding in billing claims for influenzavaccine or influenza vaccine administration. We searchedfor Current Procedural Terminology ,Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS ), and International Classication of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modication (ICD-9-CM ) codes assigned between August 1 and the end of each influenza season.We assumed that multiple codes within a 7-day periodwere duplicate codes for the same vaccination and there-fore 2 codes for the same vaccine dose were collapsed,whereas 2 codes for a known and unknown dose werecategorized as the known dose. Codes within 7 days for different known doses were considered separate doses. Codes spaced by greater than 7 days were also consideredseparate doses. Outcome Assessment We examined 3 primary clinical outcomes: all-causemortality, the rst occurrence of hospitalization forinfluenza or pneumonia, and the rst occurrence of ILI. All-cause mortality was assessed using the CMS ESRD Death Notication Form. Because laboratory-conrmed influenzastatus is not available in the claims data, we used 2 levels ofclaims-based influenza denitions from diagnosis coding:(1) hospitalization for influenza or pneumonia and (2)inpatient or outpatient ILI (see Table S3 for code lists). We performed sensitivity analysis of ILI with a narrowerdenition, as done previously. 28,29 3 months hemodialysis6-month baseline period Paent medical history Influenza seasonVaccinaonFollow-up3-month Medicare enrollment Figure 1.

To account for potential confounding by frailty 30,31and healthy-user bias,32,33we also included covariates on preventive health services (eg, other vacci-nations and health screenings), health care utilization (eg,skilled nursing days and hospital days), and frailty in-dicators (eg, oxygen use and mobility aids). We catego-rized the timing of vaccine administration as vaccination in August or September versus October through the start of influenza season. Statistical Analysis Patients could be eligible for inclusion in multiple yearlycohorts; thus, our unit of analysis was the influenzapatient-season. To examine the relationship between vac-cine dose and effectiveness outcomes, we estimated crudeand weighted cumulative risk functions using Kaplan-Meier methods, accounting for the competing risk fordeath (for the nonmortality outcomes of ILI and hospi-talization due to influenza or pneumonia). 34-36We addressed potential confounding due to differences in observed covariates between HDV and SDV recipients byusing propensity score weighting methods. Specically,we applied standardized mortality ratio weights to theKaplan-Meier estimator. We estimated the predictedprobability of receiving HDV, or the propensity score (ps),using logistic regression with a priori selected potentialconfounders as predictors ( Table S4 ). Age was restricted quadratic splines with 4 knots. Standard- ized mortality SDV recipients werecalculated as ps/(1 ps); HDV recipients remained un- weighted. 37We plotted the standardized mean differencesTable 1.

Covariate balance was assessedseparately for each subgroup analysis. Patients receiving influenza vaccine before the beginning of the influenza season were followed up from the rst day of the influenzaseason until the rst occurrence of the outcome, acompeting-risk event (ie, death for nonmortality out-comes), or a censoring event (ie, disenrollment fromMedicare Parts A and B, kidney transplantation, switch toperitoneal dialysis, loss to follow-up, receipt of a subse-quent influenza vaccine, or end of influenza season). We calculated risk differences and risk ratios using the cu- mulative risk function estimates at the end of each influ-enza season. A nonparametric-based bootstrap was used toestimate 95% condence intervals (CIs) for daily risk dif-ferences and risk ratios between groups. Additionally, weconducted bias analyses to estimate the strength of un-measured confounders that would be required to maskassociations between vaccine type and each primary outcome after adjusting for measured covariates. 39 This study using deidentied data was considered exempt from human subject review by the InstitutionalReview Board at Washington University. Analyses wereperformed using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute), and RStatistical Software, version 3.3. 40 Results After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, we iden- tied 255,281 eligible adult patients who contributed507,552 unique influenza patient-seasons ( Fig S1 ). In the primary analysis of adults 65 years and older (n =225,215 influenza patient-seasons), SDV made up 97.4%(n=219,439) of the eligible vaccinations, and HDV was administered in the remaining 2.6% (n =5,776). All were and23.3% were quadrivalent. Tables 1 and S5present characteristics of the study population stratied by vaccine dose. Mean age wasslightly older among HDV recipients than SDV recipients(75.8 vs 74.6 years). HDV administration was less com-mon among patients who were black or other race, dual- eligible for Medicaid, on dialysis for 3 or more years, or residing outside of the Midwest. HDV recipients had ahigher prevalence of several comorbid conditions,including ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pul-monary disease, cancer, and liver disease. HDV and SDVrecipients had a similar prevalence of frailty indicators.HDV recipients were more likely to receive preventivehealth care such as diabetic eye examinations, lipid testing, and cancer screenings.

The distribution of observed covariates was well balanced after propensity score weighting, as indicated bystandardized mean differences <10% in the weighted population. 41Figure S2 presents these results for the pri- mary analysis. The counts of outcome events, censoring events, competing-risk events, and person-time at risk are pre-sented for each outcome in Table 2 . Among SDV re- cipients, crude risks for death and hospitalization for pneumonia or influenza were similar (8.7% and 7.6%,respectively); in contrast, the risk for ILI was more than 3times higher (28.1%). For each outcome, we observed similar weighted risks for HDV and SDV recipients throughout the influenza sea-son, accounting for the competing risk for death for non-mortality outcomes ( Fig 2 ). In the weighted analyses, we observed similar associations between vaccine dose and risk for mortality (risk difference, 0.08%; 95% CI, 0.85% to 0.80%), hospitalization due to pneumonia (riskdifference, 0.15%; 95% CI, 0.69% to 0.93%), 0.00%; 95% CI, 1.50% to 1.08%). Results did not change appreciably in the analysis with the restricted ILI denition ( Table S7 ). Estimates on the relative scale followed similar patterns ( Table 2 ). Within subgroups, risks for mortality, hospitalization for pneumonia or influenza, and ILI were generally similarbetween HDV and SDV recipients throughout the influenzaseason, apart from few notable exceptions ( Figs 3-5 ;Tables S8-S10 ). First, we for hospi- talization among HDV versus SDV recipients in the 2010 to 1011 season (risk difference, 2.85%; 95% CI, 0.59%-5.86%), but not for any other season. Also, for both thehospitalization and ILI outcomes, we observed higher riskamong HDV versus SDV recipients who were aged 65 to74 years, lower risk among those aged 75 to 84 years, andno difference in risk between those younger than 65 or 85years and older. In the bias analyses, we quantied the possibility that our observed null associations may be explained by anunmeasured confounding variable. We observed that theexposure -confounder relative risk and the confounder- outcome relative risk must have been at least as large as1.4, 1.5, and 1.3 for mortality, hospitalization due toinfluenza or pneumonia, and ILI, respectively, to haveshifted the corresponding weighted upper condence limit across the null ( Tables S11-S13 ). Discussion We conducted a large comparative study of the effective- ness of the HDV versus SDV among adults with chronickidney failure undergoing maintenance hemodialysis inthe United States. In the overall population, we observedsimilar risks for all-cause mortality, hospitalization due to influenza or pneumonia, and ILI among patients who received HDV compared with those who received SDV.Our ndings were generally consistent across subgroups of 0.02.55.07.510.0 0 50 100 150Cumulative incidence (%)HDV SDVAll-cause mortalit y due t o influenza/pneumonia 0.010.020.030.0 05 0 1 0 0 1 5 0Influenza-like illness Figure 2.

We observed differ-ences between HDV and SDV in a few subgroups, but thepatterns were not consistent across influenza seasons or agegroups. Associations between a potential unmeasuredconfounder and our 3 outcomes would have required as- sociations that are stronger than our measured confounder-outcome associations to have masked pre-ventive effects. Consideration of the results of comparative effective- ness studies of pre ventive therapies requires careful thought about the tradeoffs of benets versus costs. Dueto the substantial influenza burden in the dialysis pop-ulation, even small improvements in vaccine effective- ness could be sufcient for recommending a specic type of annual influenza vaccination in this population.However, increased risks for side effects and increasedcosts must also be considered when weighing the cost-benet of implementing a new vaccination strategy.Our results suggest that the HDV does not provideadditional benet beyond the SDV on a population level.Additionally, the excess cost of the HDV is about $33 perdose, 42incurring an additional cost burden of $16.9 million under the assumption that all 511,000 patientson dialysis would be vaccinated with HDV. 43HDV is also more reactogenic, causing more frequent side effects,although most of these adverse events are minor (eg,injection-site reactions, systemic adverse events, and gastrointestinal events). 12,19,44-48Safety data for the HDV are limited to the healthy adult population; a comparisonof the safety of HDV versus SDV in patents receivingdialysis is needed. Previous observational studies have demonstrated that SDVs are ineffective or minimally effective at reducing all-cause mortality or influenza-related hospitalizations inpatients receiving dialysis 29,49despite reasonably robust antibody responses regarded as protective in 30% to 90% of vaccine recipients.50-55Our work extends these ndings by clarifying that the HDV does not provide additionalprotection beyond the SDV against all-cause mortality orinfluenza-related outcomes, although the HDV elicitsgreater antibody responses than SDV in patients receivingdialysis. 56These observations highlight the importance of postlicensure clinical studies that extend beyondSubgroup Risk Difference, % (95% CI) SDV vs. HDV August / September -0.68 (-1.59, 0.52) 130,035 vs. 0 2 4 6 Figure 3.

Our conclusions differ somewhat from an observational study using data from a not-for-prot dialysis provider inthe United States. 21Similar to our study, Miskulin et al21 reported similar rates of all-cause mortality among HDVversus SDV recipients. In contrast to our study, Miskulin et al reported lower rates of all-cause hospitalization among HDV versus SDV recipients, though their ndingwas restricted to the 2016 to 2017 influenza season andnot the 2015 to 2016 season. The 95% CIs for the pre-ventive effect of HDV (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.86-1.00) included the null value, whereas the effect estimatemoved down and away from the null in the subgroupanalysis restricted to patients 65 years and older (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79-0.97). Other stratied analyses suggested similar protection among HDV and SDVrecipients. Our results are not directly comparable with the previous study given several d ifferences. Specically, Miskulin et al included later seasons (2015/2016 and2016/2017), patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis,a n das m a l l e rs a m p l es i z e( N =19,157). Furthermore,the previous study did not incorporate influenza- related outcomes or use competing-risks methodologyto account for the high mortality in the dialysispopulation. Perhaps most importantly, the analysis by Miskulin et al accounted for a limited set of potential confounders andtherefore their effect estimates may be subject to residual confounding bias. In contrast, our study accounted for potential confounding by frailty 30,31and the healthy-user bias32,33through adjustment for a set of individual- and facility-level potential confounders. It iswell established that observational studies of the effec-tiveness of preventive interventions such as influenzavaccination in elderly or sick populations can be highlysubject to confounding by frailty and health care -seeking behavior because those who receive the treatment gener- ally have higher anticipation of benet by providers (eg,longer predicted life expectancies) or stronger personalmotivation to receive care (eg, better access to health care,higher socioeconomic status, and less frailty). 49,57-60 Often, this confounding is difcult to control and resultsin articially protective adjusted effect estimates due toresidual confounding.Subgroup Risk Difference, % (95% CI) SDV (-2.47, 4.28) 18,807 vs. 324 Timing of vaccination August / September 0.35 (-0.72, 1.46) 130,035 vs. 3,124 0 2 4 6 Figure 4.

However, that is not whatwe observed. Instead, older individuals receiving HDVtended to be sicker and the crude effect estimate was abovethe null, suggesting that the confounding was not due to the healthy-user phenomenon. This is supported by our previ- ous work, in which we demonstrated that comparisons ofHDV to SDV among adult patients receiving dialysis are lesssubject to confounding by the healthy-user bias thancomparisons of vaccinated versus unvaccinated persons. 61 However, despite our attempts, the possibility of unmea-sured confounding remains. Our ndings should be interpreted within the context of several factors that affect vaccine effectiveness, including influenza virus circulation, serologic vaccine match, andseasonal influenza severity. 62Our study period included a range of seasonal influenza severity (1 low severity, 2moderate, and 2 high seasons) as measured in the overallpopulation of older adults in the United States. 63These severity metrics correlated with the observed seasonal riskfor clinical outcomes in our analyses. Also, influenza A(H3N2) viruses, which are associated with lower vaccine effectiveness, were the predominant strains during allinfluenza seasons in our study, with the exception of 2013to 2014. 23-27Compared to influenza A (H1N1) or influ- enza B viruses, H3N2 viruses have more frequently un-dergone antigenic change, resulting in differences between the virus components of the influenza vaccine and circu- lating influenza viruses. 64However, the serologic vaccine match, the proportion of circulating influenza strains thatmatched the vaccine, was relatively high during 3 of the 4seasons with H3N2 as the predominant strain (ie, 97%,80%, 86%, seasons 2010/2011, 2011/2012,2012/2013, and 2014/2015, respectively), 23-27indi- cating similarity between the influenza viruses in the vaccine and circulating in the community. Our results are subject to several limitations. First, our observational study design did not involve randomizationof the exposure and therefore our effect estimates arepotentially subject to confounding by unobserved differ-ences between exposure groups. However, we attemptedto control confounding through restriction of the studypopulation (ie, by vaccination status and age), as well asSubgroup Risk Difference, % (95% CI) SDV vs. HDV (-4.84, 5.40) 18,807 vs. 324 Timing of vaccination August / September 0.47 (-1.00, 2.26) 130,035 vs. -4 -2 0 2 4 6 Figure 5. The risk for in fluenza-like illness among patients who received the high-dose (HDV) versus standard-dose (SDV) in fluenza vaccine, by subgroup. Risk differences were calculated as the difference between weighted cumulative risk functions, accounting for the competing risk for death, with bootstrap con dence intervals (CIs). Analyses were performed in adults 65 years and older, with the exception of the age-strati ed analyses. Abbreviation: ESRD, end-stage renal disease.

It is note- worthy that we did not account for individual dialysis facilities within our regression models; however, ouranalysis accounted for dialysis center -level characteristics, several of which were strong predictors of HDV receipt. 11 Second, our analysis only accounted for baseline char- acteristics measured before vaccination. However, thisapproach is supported by a previous study of influenzavaccine effectiveness among patients receiving hemodial- ysis that demonstrated that accounting for time-varying confounders of health status measured from both clinicaland claims data did not reduce bias. 49 Third, our study design required survival until 9 months after dialysis initiation; therefore, our results maynot generalize to all incident patients. Fourth, in theabsence of laboratory-conrmed influenza outcomes, weused claims-based denitions. Thus, outcome misclassi- cation is a possibility, though we used sensitivity analyses to explore the impact of the denitions on our ndings.Fifth, some subgroup analyses may have had limited abilityto detect a true difference between HDV and SDV givensmall numbers of HDV recipients. Sixth, the start date offollow-up was based on national influenza data andtherefore ignores geographic variation in the timing ofinfluenza seasons. Last, our study is primarily based on administrative billing claims data, which are collected for administrativeand reimbursement purposes, rather than for clinicalresearch. Thus, we were not able to account for certainimportant clinical factors unavailable in claims data (eg,body mass index, vascular access, and laboratory mea-surements) that may result in confounding bias, and someof our measures may be subject to misclassication, such as vaccination ascertainment if patients paid out of pocket. However, we expect this misclassication to be unlikelybecause patients receiving regular in-center hemodialysishave very frequent health care encounters in dialysisclinics, and influenza vaccination is offered to Medicarebeneciaries without a co-pay. Importantly, our use ofthese data is also a strength because it captures informationon a wide variety of health-related diagnoses, procedures, use of durable medical equipment, frailty markers, hos- pitalizations, and death. In summary, our large comparative study failed to demonstrate that HDV has superior effectiveness comparedto SDV for preventing all-cause mortality and influenza-related outcomes among patients receiving maintenancehemodialysis. Given the ndings of our population-levelstudy, along with the substantially higher cost and side- effect prole of HDV compared to SDV, it appears that HDV should not conclusively be considered the standard ofcare at the present time for influenza immunization ofpatients treated by maintenance hemodialysis. The ndingsof our population-level study should not be interpreted todiscourage influenza vaccination in the dialysis population.Rather, dialysis patients should continue to receive annualinfluenza immunization per CDC guidelines. 8In addition,future studies of alternative strategies (eg, booster doses) and alternative vaccine production technologies (eg, adjuvanted or cell-based vaccines) are warranted becausethere remains a need for improved influenza preventionefforts in this population.
