(OTCBB: TPIV) is pleased to announce the January publication of a paper titled \"Enzymatic Discovery of a HER-2/neu Epitope That Generates Cross-Reactive T-cells\", authored by Henle et al, J.Immunol. (2013), 190, 479-488. This work, performed in the laboratory of Dr Keith Knutson at Mayo Clinic, describes the discovery of a novel HER-2/neu Class I epitope (p373-382) TapImmune has licensed from Mayo Clinic for the development of breast cancer vaccines. The significance of this work is that this newly discovered antigen is a naturally occurring antigen processed by the proteasome and elicits peptide-specific T-cell responses. This results in stronger binding to HLA-A2 and more efficient killing of HER-2/neu positive breast cancer cells by activated T-cells compared to the Class I epitope, p369-377 (E75) which was not naturally processed by the proteasome. \"These results provide an explanation of the molecular immunology behind our approach to HER-2/neu immunotherapy,\" said Mark Reddish Vice President of TapImmune Inc. \"These data describe how the HER-2/neu protein is processed by the proteasome to then be presented for immune recognition and killing. By revealing the true identity of the immunodominant epitope responsible for class I mediated killing of HER-2/neu positive tumors, it is now possible to generate a true second generation vaccine that incorporates the correct target as it naturally appears on human tumors. For nearly 20 years the immunology of this key protein has been clouded by contradictory observations, and these data finally provide an understanding of the 'natural target' displayed on human tumors. We expect to combine this immunodominant peptide with our broadly reactive helper peptides that are currently being tested in a phase I trial, to create a true second generation vaccine candidate.\" TapImmune's approach to development of a vaccine to treat HER-2/neu breast cancer is described in a white paper that can read at our website (www.tapimmune.com). About TapImmune Inc. TapImmune Inc. is a vaccine technologies company specializing in the development of innovative gene based immunotherapeutics and vaccines in the areas of oncology and infectious disease. The Company's lead product candidates, include vaccines designed to restore and augment antigen presentation and subsequent recognition and killing of cancer cells by the immune system. The Company is also developing TAP-based prophylactic vaccines commercially suitable for the prevention of infectious diseases and as Biodefense agents. As a vaccine component, the gene based TAP technology has the potential to significantly improve the efficacy of both prophylactic and immunotherapeutic vaccines as it addresses a fundamental mechanism for T cell recognition and response. Unlike other vaccine technologies that address only the initiation of immune responses, TAP expression also has the unique ability to enhance the effector function of mature killer T cells. This enhancement of effector function is potentially complementary to any/all vaccine approaches that are designed to enhance cellular responses. The Company is developing cancer vaccines that combine the use of novel antigens together with its TAP expression technology.
