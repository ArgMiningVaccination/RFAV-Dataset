THE PROBLEM Global CO2 emissions are causing a drastic and irreversible change in our climate. Decarbonization of the energy industry is key to solving this crisis. Unfortunately, energy storage lags behind alternative energy production and prevents its widespread implementation. THE SOLUTION In order to shift to fully renewable and sustainable energy, we need efficient and cost-effective ways to store it. THE SOLUTION In order to shift to fully renewable and sustainable energy, we need efficient and cost-effective ways to store it. OUR TECHNOLOGY Energy Dome's proprietary technology is the answer to fighting climate change. By using CO2 in a closed thermodynamic process, we offer electricity storage in a cost-effective way, with unprecedented round-trip efficiency and without emissions.
