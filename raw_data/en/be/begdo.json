I hereby appoint the Honorable J ACKQUINN to act as Speaker pro tempore on this day. J. D ENNIS HASTERT , Speaker of the House of Representatives. /fdash PRAYER The Reverend Father James Nock, Senate Chaplain, State of Connecticut, Hartford, Connecticut, offered the fol- lowing prayer: Almighty Father, we ask Your bless- ing on this august body, as we come to- gether this morning to do the work of our Nation. Let us never forget the potential we share together, to accomplish anything we choose. For with our combined tal- ents, abilities, and experiences, there is no limit to what we can accomplish, only the limit of our own imaginations. And we ask this of You, who lives and reigns, forever and ever. Amen. /fdash THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day's proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Jour- nal stands approved. /fdash PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. W ICK- ER) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance.Mr. WICKER led the Pledge of Alle- giance as follows: I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub- lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. /fdash WELCOME TO FATHER JAMES J. NOCK (Mr. LARSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. LARSON. Mr. Speaker, I would first like to extend a heartfelt thanks to Chaplain Ford for providing an op- portunity for a dear friend and a pastor of mine in East Hartford, a person who has brought home and shepherds the flock on a regular basis, Dr. James Nock from East Hartford. Father Nock was born in Hartford, Connecticut, of Italian and Irish de- cent. He is a graduate of Saint Bonaventure University, and he also took his graduate studies at Sulpice in Paris, France; ordained in the Cathe- dral of Notre Dame in Paris on June 26, 1964, and currently the pastor of Our Lady of Peace in East Hartford, Con- necticut. Father also has served as the Chap- lain of the Connecticut State Senate, and he has always brought not only great wisdom in his remarks but a great sense of humor and a sense about the people he serves here on Earth. I want to thank Chaplain Ford so much for providing Father Nock, the parish and the community of East Hartford with this wonderful opportunity. /fdash ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will entertain 10 one-minutes on each side.CLINTON-GORE ADMINISTRATION SHORTCHANGING MEDICARE (Mr. WICKER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. WICKER. Mr. Speaker, the mes- sage is beginning to get through that the Clinton-Gore administration is shortchanging Medicare. Ill-advised regulations are threatening the quality of health care for our Nation's retired citizens by cutting Medicare $20 billion below the level set by Congress in the Balanced Budget Act. In a letter this month to HHS Sec- retary Shalala, 20 Democratic Senators joined 21 Republican Senators in urg- ing this administration to reverse its decision, warning that harm could come to elderly patients. This bipar- tisan letter warns that if regulations are not revised, we may see closings of facilities, layoffs of dedicated care- givers, reductions in access to skilled nursing services and erosion of quality of care. I say to our President, your cuts in Medicare are unacceptable and they are not in compliance with the Bal- anced Budget Act. It is time for this administration to provide the re- sources our senior citizens require. /fdash BIPARTISAN EFFORT FOR CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM (Mr. DOGGETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, last year we forced a vote on reform to clean up the way congressional cam- paigns are conducted. In the words of the respected commentator, Mary McGrory: ``To get the bill to the floor reformers had to pry it out of the clenched jaws of Speaker Newt Ging- rich by gathering signatures on a dis- charge petition.'' When that vote for reform finally and belatedly occurred, we found out why.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3396 May 20, 1999 Every single Republican leader voted against the bipartisan reform, sup- ported by good government groups, and every Democratic leader voted for it. Nevertheless, Republican delay wrote the obituary for this proposal in the Senate. This year we face the same problem. Here in this House, 196 Democrats have signed a petition to force debate on all proposals, Democratic and Republican, now. Speaker H ASTERT and Mr. D ELAY say wait until some time in the fall. Every Republican member who refuses to sign this petition for timely action is complicit in killing reform. Join us in a bipartisan effort. Sign now and act now. /fdash HMO REFORM (Mr. GANSKE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GANSKE. Mr. Speaker, I want to correct the record. The other night I gave a special order on HMO reform and inadvertently mentioned the NFIB. In fact, the results I mentioned were from the National Survey of Small Business Executives on Health Care by the Kaiser-Harvard Program on Public Health and Social Policy. I was cor- rect, however, in citing the numbers. When this group of 300 small business executives was asked if HMO reform were passed into law and would in- crease premiums by up to $5 a month, only 1 percent said they would drop coverage and 5 percent did not know; 94 percent would continue coverage. This cost is in the range of what I think my legislation would affect pre- miums. This is borne out by the CEO of Iowa Blue Cross/Blue Shield telling me that his plan is implementing the President's commission recommenda- tions on quality and they do not expect to see an increase in premiums from that. Mr. Speaker, the opponents of HMO reform are trying to scare people about the effects of cost on access to care. I will be happy to share this survey of small business executives with anyone who wants to see some real data. /fdash VOTE ON SHAYS-MEEHAN BEFORE MEMORIAL DAY (Mr. PASCRELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, with all civility, Congress is still divided be- tween those who believe there is too much money in our campaigns and those who believe there is never enough. We sell democracy short if we think the voters are not watching our electoral behavior. They are becoming very interested in how we handle cam- paign financing. Last year, the freshman campaign fi- nance bill was used as interference in getting Shays-Meehan to the floor. With the discharge petition from both sides, we accomplished a vote. We donot need any obstructions now. Let us get on with it. Let us restore credi- bility to the electoral process now, not later. Shays-Meehan needs to be voted on before Memorial Day. We can do this in a bipartisan way. I appeal to my col- leagues, let us conclude this debate in a civil tone. I think it is the best for America. /fdash BREAST CANCER COALITION (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, did my colleagues know this year alone one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and did they know that of those positively diagnosed women 75 percent will have had no family history of breast cancer? It continues to be the leading cause of cancer deaths for all women ages 35 to 54. My home State of Florida has the third highest rate of breast cancer. These numbers have caused champions like Jane Torres, President of the Flor- ida Breast Cancer Coalition, to dedi- cate their lives on heightening aware- ness. Due to the work of groups like the Florida Breast Cancer Coalition, Fed- eral funds for research have now in- creased by as much as sixfold. Eager advocates like Jane, Jill Lawrence, Shelly Greenberg, Midge Blumberg- Krams, Teresa Menendez, Claudia Dobelstein and all of the members of the Florida Breast Cancer Coalition will continue to fight until this treach- erous disease is eradicated. Congratula- tions to them. /fdash A NATION THAT BANS GOD IS A NATION THAT OPENS THE DOOR TO THE DEVIL (Mr. TRAFICANT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. TRAFICANT. Mr. Speaker, an- other school shooting; this time in Georgia. Everyone is desperately searching for answers. I say the search should stop right here. Congress must look in the mirror, because in America today our students can study cults, devil worship, Hitler, but God is banned, banned from our schools. I say a nation that bans God is a nation that opens the door to the devil and to the problems that we are facing as a na- tion. Congress, it is time to allow God back into our schools, and I further recommend after all the technicalities we allow God back into our Nation. /fdash RETURN ``THE HUMAN RIGHTS'' TO THE DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT (Mr. DIAZ-BALART asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to protest a violation of the U.S. Constitution's Bill of Rights by the Clinton administration. The Fourth Amendment to the Constitu- tion guarantees that the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against un- reasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated. Mr. Ramon Saul Sanchez, the Presi- dent of the Democracy Movement, has been on a hunger strike in Miami for 16 days. He began this protest on May 5 to protest the illegal confiscation of the boat, The Human Rights, by the Coast Guard, acting on orders from the Clin- ton-Gore White House. The small boat was confiscated for the crime of car- rying copies of the Universal Declara- tion of Human Rights on the high seas the same day that dissidents within Cuba had announced that they would peacefully be commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declara- tion of Human Rights. That apparently seditious document for the Clinton administration reads, everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence. Mr. President, today is Cuban Inde- pendence Day. Bring an end to the hun- ger strike. Return The Human Rights to the Democracy Movement. /fdash NINE OUT OF TEN AMERICANS SUPPORT CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM (Mr. CROWLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, refer- ring to the Democratic campaign fi- nance reform discharge petition, which has 196 Democratic signatures, a Re- publican recently remarked in Roll Call and I quote, ``People who sign the discharge petition are committing treason against the party. That is how strongly I feel about that. That is a dangerous position to take and we need to end that talk.'' It is no surprise the Republican Party, which outspends Democrats two-to-one, has proclaimed that sup- porting campaign finance reform should be a felony offense. Mr. Speaker, our political system needs and our constituents demand campaign finance reform now. Nine out of 10 Americans support campaign fi- nance reform. I repeat, 9 out of 10 Americans. Last year, 196 Members signed the discharge petition that led to bringing the Shays-Meehan bipar- tisan campaign finance reform bill to the House floor. /ballot1015 Without that petition process, the House Republican leadership would never have let that debate occur. Time is running out. In order to have enough time for the Senate to pass campaign finance reform, moderate Republicans must sign this discharge petition im- mediately.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3397 May 20, 1999 Mr. Speaker, the House must act now on campaign finance reform, and pass it before Memorial Day. /fdash THE COLD WAR IS OVER, BUT DANGEROUS ENEMIES STILL EXIST (Mr. PITTS asked and was given per- mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, the Cold War is over. These words we have heard repeated thousands of times since the end of Communist tyranny in Berlin in 1989, especially by leftists whose eager- ness to gut our military forces was similarly obvious, even at the height of the Cold War. But though the Cold War is tempo- rarily over, all of human history ar- gues that it would be foolish to let our defenses down. Dangerous enemies still exist. They do not care what treaties we sign, how much good will Ameri- cans have, and they do not care how prosperous we become. They wish to do us harm because they resent our wealth, reject our democratic values, despise our reli- gious traditions, and cannot maintain their tyrannies at home knowing that freedom exists in a bastion we call America. The very existence of our Na- tion threatens their existence. This chart dramatically shows what happens when a Nation ignores the les- sons of history. We do so at our peril. /fdash THE BOMBING IN YUGOSLAVIA MUST STOP AND DIPLOMATIC MEASURES TOWARDS PEACE MUST BE ACCELERATED (Mr. KUCINICH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, last night three innocent people died and scores were injured in the bombing of a Belgrade hospital by NATO air forces. This tragedy, taken with the NATO bombing of the Swedish Ambassador's residence, the recent NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, the NATO bombing of refugee convoys, the NATO bombing of passenger buses and trains and other civilian infrastruc- ture, raises grave questions about the strategy and the morality of NATO's actions. It is no longer acceptable for NATO to blithely declare that the mass of ci- vilian casualties resulting from the bombings are unintentional and there- fore simply accidental. When such acci- dents keep repeating themselves and result in the countless deaths of inno- cent people, it is time to say this must stop. The continued bombing and the con- sequent catastrophic parade of inno- cent human carnage, and NATO's arro- gant willingness to endanger innocent civilians, even to mothers giving birth in hospitals, forfeits NATO's claim tothe moral high ground. The bombing must stop, and diplomatic measures to- wards peace must be accelerated. /fdash URGING MEMBERS TO JOIN IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 883, THE AMER- ICAN LAND SOVEREIGNTY PRO- TECTION ACT (Mr. GIBBONS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. GIBBONS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Y OUNG ), chairman of the Committee on Resources, and the 183 Members who are cosponsors of H.R. 883, the American Land Sovereignty Protection Act. It is time that the Congress reclaim its authority granted under the Con- stitution to make decisions over lands belonging to the United States. The United Nations has absolutely no right to make land designations for America's liberty bell, our Independ- ence Hall, or the Statue of Liberty, or for that matter, any land management decisions for our national parks like the Grand Canyon or Yosemite. Former Ambassador Jeanne Kirk- patrick said it best: ``What recourse does an American voter have when U.N. bureaucrats from Connecticut or Iraq or Libya have made decisions that unjustly damage his or her property rights that lie near a national park?'' It is time that this Congress reclaim its constitutional authority and it is time that America reclaims her lands. I encourage Members to join me in sup- porting H.R. 883, the American Land Sovereignty Protection Act. Mr. Speaker, I yield back any con- stitutional authority we may have left. /fdash CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM (Mrs. CAPPS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re- marks.) Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, today I am speaking from the other side of the aisle to reach out to our Republican friends. Many of them have been lead- ers in the effort to reform our cam- paign finance system. I applaud them for this. Today we need their courage more than ever. It now appears we will not be debat- ing this issue until September, if at all. It is difficult to go against leadership. No one likes to do this. I do not, either. But some issues require us to take a stand, and this is one of those times. Today I am asking Members to stand for what they and I and the American people believe by signing the Blue Dog discharge petition. Let us bring cam- paign finance reform to the floor for a debate. We need to do it now. /fdash THE ADMINISTRATION IS AGAIN PLAYING POLITICS WITH MEDI- CARE (Mr. HEFLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1minute and to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. HEFLEY. Mr. Speaker, whom should Americans trust more to pro- tect the Medicare program for seniors? Let us look at the facts. Democrats sat idly by while Medicare was on the verge of bankruptcy during the period of time that they controlled both the White House and the Con- gress. Then Republicans won the ma- jority of the Congress, and almost im- mediately reformed and strengthened Medicare for the first time ever. Demo- crats then attacked Republicans for re- forming a program that should have been reformed a long time ago. That is fact number one. Now consider this. We find out that this administration is spending $20 bil- lion less on Medicare than the law al- lows. Let me repeat that. This adminis- tration is spending $20 billion less on Medicare than Congress intended and as authorized by law. Hospitals are feeling the pinch. Sen- iors are not getting the care they need as quickly as they need it. Why is this administration playing politics once again with Medicare? Again, I ask the question, whom should seniors trust more to protect Medicare? /fdash TRANSPORTATION BUREAUCRATS SEEK TO PENALIZE WORKING AMERICANS (Mr. CHABOT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, the same Federal government that wants to see our medical records, monitor our bank- ing transactions, register our private post office box, and if the Vice Presi- dent has his way, tell us where to live, now wants to tax our drive to work every day. Transportation officials in Maryland, with the apparent support of the Fed- eral Highway Administration, are cooking up a silly idea that will allow those who can afford it to skirt rush hour traffic by paying to drive in a spe- cial HOT or high-occupancy toll lane. Those who cannot afford or do not want to pay an additional tax on a highway their tax dollars are already paying for are welcome to sit in rush hour traffic while those in the so-called Lexus lanes speed by. Mr. Speaker, the reason there is a rush hour is that people have to go to work. They have to go to work to sup- port their families and to pay their taxes, which help to pay the salaries of transportation bureaucrats who come up with these lame-brained ideas like this one. Let us put a stop to this silliness be- fore it is too late. /fdash ASKING ALL MEMBERS TO SUP- PORT THE CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM DISCHARGE PETITION (Mr. LUTHER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3398 May 20, 1999 minute and to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. LUTHER. Mr. Speaker, I am here today to ask all Democrats and Repub- licans to sign the campaign finance re- form discharge petition. I say that, Mr. Speaker, because there is no issue more important to the future of this country than this particular issue. I ask Members to ask themselves why it seems that Congress can never get anything done. I ask Members to ask themselves why Congress cannot pass health care reform legislation, child safety legislation, or the many other pressing issues facing this coun- try. Ask why that supplemental fund- ing bill this week was filled with pork barrel spending, rather than dealing with national priorities like education. A good part of the answer is the way we fund campaigns in this country, the influence of special interests. We passed this bill, we debated it last year. We can pass it again now. We do not need to wait so that it gets tied up in budget negotiations or in politics of next year's elections. We can pass it for the American people today. /fdash THE HISTORY OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE (Mr. SCHAFFER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. SCHAFFER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to the vacuous bleatings of my esteemed colleagues on the liberal side of the aisle who invoke campaign finance reform as their lat- est slogan. How truly audacious for the very people who created the current cam- paign finance reform to now self-right- eously proclaim their outrage at the way the government makes crooks out of the truly honest people among us. Just what is it about the liberal mindset that allows them to avoid re- sponsibility for so many of their bad ideas and failed initiatives? Consider the history of campaign fi- nance. The liberals imposed absurdly low limits on the participation of Americans in the political process. It is truly amazing how this has resulted in things that were entirely predictable. What happened? Politicians were then forced to spend almost all their time raising money, and of course money then found other ways into the political process through soft money, through issue advocacy, and, dare I mention, through the Chinese Com- munist friends of the White House. And of course this money, unlike direct contributions, lacks full disclosure, which is an invitation to corruption. Why are Democrats not talking about that? /fdash URGING COSPONSORSHIP OF THE BORDER PATROL RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION ACT (Mr. REYES asked and was given per- mission to address the House for 1minute and to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. REYES. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to urge my colleagues to co- sponsor a bill that the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. J ACKSON -LEE) and I are introducing today, the Border Con- trol Recruitment and Retention Act. This bill will correct a longstanding problem within the INS, and begins to address some of the recruitment and retention problems we have heard so much about lately. This bill is not a cure-all. It is, however, a step in the right direction. I will continue to work with my col- leagues on legislation for comprehen- sive pay reform for the United States Border Patrol. Currently most Border Patrol agents are kept at the GS\u00b19 Journeyman level, with only 30 percent of the work force actually working at GS\u00b111, even though their work is much more comprehensive. The bill we are introducing today states that any GS\u00b19 with a current rating of fully successful will auto- matically qualify for GS\u00b111. What does this mean? It means that on the aver- age, Border Patrol agents will move from a salary of about $34,000 a year to a salary of about $41,000. It addresses a pay disparity. It is fitting that we in- troduce this legislation today and push for its passage this year, which is the United States Border Patrol's 7th anni- versary. I believe that this is the least we can do for an agency that is at the front line of the defense for this country. /fdash TO FORMER DEMOCRAT RUDY BRADLEY, WELCOME TO THE GOP (Mr. STEARNS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, there is a trend going on in America today that is not talked much about, particularly on that side, at least on the national level. It is a phenomenon of party switching, and it is party-switching going in one direction and one direc- tion only, from Democrats to Repub- licans. Over 390 elected Democrats have switched to the GOP since Clinton and Gore were elected in 1992. Well, the Re- publican Party would like to welcome the latest party-switcher, State Rep- resentative Rudy Bradley of St. Peters- burg, Florida. Rudy Bradley is the only black Re- publican in the 160-member Florida legislature, for now. Here we have a lifetime proud Democrat who has fi- nally come to the conclusion that the Democratic Party simply does not re- flect his values or the values of his con- stituents. He is tired of the Democrats' con- stant demonizing those who disagree with them. He is tired of rhetoric that says one thing while governing as a tax and spend liberal. He is tired of the at- tacks on the traditional values that made America great to begin with.Rudy, welcome to the GOP. /fdash CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM (Ms. BERKLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re- marks.) Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Speaker, every Member of Congress knows firsthand the control that money has over our electoral process, and what is worse, the American people know firsthand the control that money has over our electoral process. The money spent on last November's election totaled $1 billion. This is an outrageous sum that hurts our democ- racy and it hurts our constituents. If voters are disgusted and turned off by the excesses in campaign financing they will not vote, and make no mis- take, voters are disgusted. They are turned off and they are not voting. Our constituents deserve better. The American people deserve better. Let us ban soft money and stop the attack ads disguised as issue advocacy soft money pays for. Let us strengthen the Federal Election Commission and give it the teeth it needs to enforce campaign fi- nance laws. This Congress must act to restore confidence and participation in our electoral system. Last month my colleagues and I signed a discharge petition to demand that Congress take up the important issue of campaign finance reform. The very fact that as Members of Congress we must petition our government speaks volumes and is a testament to the control money has over our elec- toral process. We must prove to our constituents that we are serious about real reform. We must make sure that our political system represents everyone, not just those that can afford it. /fdash AMERICAN LAND SOVEREIGNTY PROTECTION ACT Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Com- mittee on Rules, I call up House Reso- lution 180 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as fol- lows: H. R ES. 180 Resolved, That at any time after the adop- tion of this resolution the Speaker may, pur- suant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 833) to pre- serve the sovereignty of the United States over public lands and acquired lands owned by the United States, and to preserve State sovereignty and private property rights in non-Federal lands surrounding those public lands and acquired lands. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. General de- bate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and con- trolled by the chairman and ranking minor- ity member of the Committee on Resources. After general debate, the bill shall be consid- ered for amendment under the five-minuteCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3399 May 20, 1999 rule for a period not to exceed four hours. The bill shall be considered as read. No amendment to the bill shall be in order ex- cept those printed in the portion of the Con- gressional Record designated for that pur- pose in clause 8 of rule XVIII and except pro forma amendments for the purpose of debate. Each amendment so printed may be offered only by the Member who caused it to be printed or his designee and shall be consid- ered as read. The chairman of the Committee of the Whole may: (1) postpone until a time during further consideration in the Com- mittee of the Whole a request for a recorded vote on any amendment; and (2) reduce to five minutes the minimum time for elec- tronic voting on any postponed question that follows another electronic vote without in- tervening business, provided that the min- imum time for electronic voting on the first in any series of questions shall be 15 min- utes. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or with- out instructions. /ballot1030 AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR . HASTINGS OF WASHINGTON Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that House Resolution 180 be amended on page 2, line 2, by striking ``833'' and in- serting in lieu thereof ``883''. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. QUINN). Is there objection to the re- quest of the gentleman from Wash- ington? There was no objection. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Page 2, line 2, strike ``833'' and insert in lieu thereof ``883''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen- tleman from Washington (Mr. HASTINGS ) is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from New York (Ms. S LAUGHTER ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. (Mr. HASTINGS of Washington asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 180 would grant H.R. 883, the American Land Sovereignty Protection Act, a modified open rule, providing 1 hour of general debate to be divided equally between the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Resources. The rule provides for a 4-hour limit on the amendment process and pro- vides that the bill shall be considered as read. Additionally, the rule makes in order only those amendments preprinted in the C ONGRESSIONAL RECORD and pro forma amendments for the purpose of debate. Amendments that are preprinted may be offered only by the Member who caused them to beprinted or his designee, shall be consid- ered as read, and may be amended. The rule further allows the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole to post- pone votes during consideration of the bill and to reduce voting time to 5 min- utes on a postponed question if the vote follows a 15-minute vote. Finally, the rule provides for one motion to re- commit, with or without instructions. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 883 was reported by the Committee on Resources. The bill would restore the constitutional role of Congress in managing lands belonging to the United States, preserve the sov- ereignty of the United States over its lands, and protect State sovereignty and private property rights in non-Fed- eral lands adjacent to the Federal lands. Under Article IV, section 3 of the Constitution, Congress is vested with the authority to regulate Federal lands. Yet, over the past 25 years, an increasing expansion of our Nation's public lands have been included in var- ious land use programs with little con- gressional oversight or approval. Two notable programs are the United Na- tions Biosphere Reserves and the World Heritage Sites, both of which are under the jurisdiction of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization or UNESCO. There are now 47 UNESCO Biosphere Reserves and 20 World Heritage Sites in the United States. By becoming party to these international land use agree- ments through executive action, but without congressional authorization, the United States may be indirectly agreeing to terms to international treaties which the Senate has refused to ratify. By consenting to international land use designations, the United States in effect agrees to impose restrictions on surrounding lands which, in many cases, include a substantial amount of private property. Subjecting private property owners to land use restric- tions imposed without their consent, or even the consent of their elected rep- resentatives, is a very serious matter. It is a practice which this Congress should emphatically reject. In response to growing concern about this situation, H.R. 883 would amend the National Historic Preservation Act to require congressional approval be- fore any nominated property may be included in the World Heritage list. It would require the Secretary of the In- terior to submit a report to Congress describing what impact inclusion on the World Heritage list would have on the natural resources associated with these nominated lands. The bill would prohibit the Secretary of Interior from nominating a property for inclusion on the World Heritage list until the Secretary makes findings that existing commercially viable uses of the nominated land or land within 10 miles of the nomination would not be adversely affected by its inclusion. H.R. 883 would prohibit Federal offi- cials from nominating any land in theU.S. for designation as a Biosphere Re- serve and would terminate all existing Biosphere Reserves unless, one, the Biosphere Reserve is specifically au- thorized in law by a date certain, two, the designated Biosphere Reserve con- sists entirely of land owned by the U.S., and, three, a management plan has been implemented which specifi- cally provides for the protection of non-Federal property rights and uses. Finally, Mr. Speaker, the bill would prohibit Federal officials from desig- nating any land in the United States for a special or restricted use under any international agreement unless such designation is specifically ap- proved by law, and would also prohibit including any State, local, or privately owned land in any such designation, unless that designation is approved by those affected parties. The Committee on Rules has re- ported a modified rule, as requested by the gentleman from Alaska (Chairman YOUNG ) of the Committee on Re- sources, in order to provide Members of the House seeking to amend this legis- lation with the full and fair oppor- tunity to do so. Accordingly, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying bill, H.R. 883. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con- sume and I thank my colleague for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. Mr. Speaker, this resolution calls for a modified open rule which makes in order only those amendments preprinted in the C ONGRESSIONAL RECORD and limits debate of the bill to 4 hours. These restrictions are wholly unnecessary. Any time one imposes an arbitrary time limit, one runs the risk of limiting full debate. I oppose the rule in its current form and note that open rules best protect all Members' rights to fully represent their constitu- ents. Moreover, I have significant concerns about the legislation the rule makes in order. While the bill purports to pre- serve U.S. sovereignty over the use of Federal lands, in reality, this measure is unnecessary and could hinder United States participation in international efforts to protect and preserve valuable lands throughout the world. Similar dubious legislation has failed in two previous Congresses, and this bill will get the same fate. The World Heritage Convention and the Man and Biosphere Program will provide the international community with means of recognizing areas with great natural and cultural significance. These honorific programs respect each State's sovereignty and have no legal jurisdiction over countries or commu- nities. Since 1973, the World Heritage Con- vention has successfully been imple- mented by the United States Depart- ment of Interior. The Convention was, in fact, a United States initiative under then President Richard Nixon.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3400 May 20, 1999 A site may be listed as a World Herit- age site only if it contains cultural or natural resources of universal value, and if the national government where the site is located nominates and pro- tects the site. Listing an area as a World Heritage site imposes no change in U.S. law nor any requirement for future changes in domestic law. It does not give over- sight, management, or regulatory au- thority over United States lands to any foreign and national organization. Nor does the United States Man and Biosphere Program place any U.S. lands or resources under the control of the United Nations or any inter- national body. In fact, this is a domes- tic Federal program. It, therefore, does not impose any restrictions beyond those already in place under American law. For over 20 years, under the auspices of four Republican and two Democratic Presidents, these programs have func- tioned with little or no controversy. The allegations by the proponents of H.R. 883 that these beneficial programs somehow threaten the United States sovereignty are pure fantasy. However we do have a Federal, for- eign encroachment on American lands, and I am referring to the mining and mineral rights that have been leased to foreign corporations with leases that cost about an average of $2.50 per acre per year. These leases have been in ef- fect since the days of Ulysses S. Grant. If we would like to do something to protect our own lands, and stop cheat- ing our taxpayers. We should change this disgraceful giveaway. Our national parks do need atten- tion, but Congress certainly could do better than this bill, which is designed to remedy an imaginary problem, the supposed encroachment of foreign domination over our public resources. Mr. Speaker, another community woke this morning to the horror of a school shooting. It is not as bad as Col- umbine we are told. We hope that these are not going to be fatal shots. But surely this House can be better spend- ing this time, rather than spending 4 hours on this one House nowhere bill, and be working on after-school pro- grams and try to do something about bringing guns under some control. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield as much time as he may consume to the gen- tleman from Tennessee (Mr. D UNCAN ). Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill by the dis- tinguished gentleman from Alaska (Mr. YOUNG ), chairman of the Committee on Resources, and the rule that brings this bill to the floor. This bill does not prohibit or stop the United States from including land in an international land reserve. All it says is that there must first be con- gressional approval so that the private property rights of neighboring land- owners can be protected.What this bill is attempting to do is to allow a little more public input into this process and give the people a tiny bit of say about actions that can have tremendous impact on their land. It really boils down to whether we still have a government of, by, and for the people, or has it become one of, by, and for unelected bureaucrats and elitists who want to control other peo- ple's land. Jeane Kirkpatrick, our former am- bassador to the United Nations, wrote to the Committee on Resources these words, ``In U.N. organizations, there is no accountability. U.N. bureaucrats are far removed from the American voters. What recourse does an Amer- ican voter have when U.N. bureaucrats from Cuba or Iraq or Libya, all of which are parties to this treaty, have made a decision that unjustly damages his or her property rights that lie near a national park?'' Professor Jeremy Rabkin of the De- partment of Government of Cornell University testified in support of this bill, saying, ``The underlying problem is that international regulatory schemes now reach more deeply into the internal affairs of sovereign na- tions and have therefore begun to threaten internal systems of govern- ment,'' adding that ``such ventures are in some ways as much a threat to the stability of international law as they are to our own system of government at home.'' Professor Rabkin said we need this bill, not to slow this dangerous trend toward taking government further away from the people, but also, ``as a means of reasserting our own constitu- tional traditions.'' Professor Detlev Vagts of the Har- vard Law School said international in- volvement in local and private land use decisions, ``pose an import problem'' in their ``tendency to shift powers and re- sponsibilities from national and sub- national units, with active, reachable legislative bodies to remote inter- national bureaucracies.'' I realize that some opponents of this bill do not want to debate this on the merits, so they resort to childish sar- casm and try to make this bill seem less than serious by making fun of it. But this bill deserves the support of all those who really believe in private property and limited government and the freedom that is protected by those two great traditions on which this Na- tion was built. Private property is not only one of the key components of our prosperity. It is one of the main things that set us apart from the former Soviet Union and other socialist Nations. Today almost one-third of our land is owned by the Federal Government, and another 20 percent is owned by State and local governments and quasi-gov- ernmental units. Governments at all levels are rapidly taking over addi- tional land. Perhaps even more of a threat to freedom are the restrictions being placed by government on land still in private ownership.We heard testimony from Steven Lindsey whose family has operated a ranch on Turkey Creek in rural Ari- zona since the 1860s. He was shocked to find out one day that a 60-acre private wetland on his property was now con- trolled by the international RAMSAR Convention agreement in addition to all the endangered species and other regulations he was already under. /ballot1045 Under Ramsar, Mr. Lindsey said, ``My rights as a private property owner are threatened and the Ramsar lan- guage can be used to violate my prop- erty rights and deprive me of the use of my land.'' He added these words, Mr. Speaker: ``The same government that promised my great, great grandfather and my great grandfather the land through the Homestead Act and pursuit of happi- ness is now the same government that is helping destroy these dreams.'' Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill, a se- rious bill; and people who truly believe in freedom, rather than big brother re- pressive government, should support it enthusiastically. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. V ENTO ). (Mr. VENTO asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. VENTO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me the time. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule. Frankly, this bill is not cor- rectable by amendment. I think the proper disposition of it is to defeat this bill. I think it is, obviously, a great misunderstanding. I think it reflects a fear that has been translated into leg- islative language which is inappro- priate and I think the wrong direction clearly to move, and so I do not know how I could amend it. In the last session, Mr. Speaker, a lot of concern arose because we proposed some 60 or 70 different amendments to this bill. It touches on about 82 areas in the United States that are classified as World Heritage sites, as Man and the Biosphere program, or as Ramsar sites. There may be more sites in the United States, but those are the three prin- cipal treaties that deal with natural and cultural resources of distinction, usually within our parks or in those areas; and Man and the Biosphere pro- grams which focus on special natural environments, other types of environ- ments that are used for scientific re- search; and the Ramsar sites, which protect wetlands. There may be other treaties and com- pacts that are affected, Mr. Speaker. They have not been spoken of or ex- plored in committee. In fact, I think most of the committee meetings have been based on a lot of emotionalism and misconceptions and obviously some distaste for the United Nations, which happens to be associated loosely with some of the designations here and recognitions that have taken place.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3401 May 20, 1999 Incidentally, when I was looking at the numbers, there are nearly 2,000 sites globally that are recognized under these programs. The United States has very few sites that we have let in the development of these treaties and pro- grams; and, of course, to in fact renege on this presents all sorts of problems to us in terms of our global leadership in terms of the environment. But that I think is really at the heart of this that there are those that cannot attack these parks, these wildernesses directly, so they choose to wrap them- selves in American sovereignty and some displeasure I guess with the U.N., Mr. Speaker, and it is manifest in this bill that we have before us today, H.R. 883. The rule is really unfair because we had talked and while there was some fear that we might offer 70 amend- ments, as I said, it is not correctable, but nevertheless the Committee on Rules gets up and suggested that it is offering an open rule, that we can offer any amendments that we want. But then they impose this time limitation on the bill. I do not think that any of us have any visions of keeping the Congress in session all day tonight and late into the hours, especially a day when many Members would like to travel home to their districts so they can work and be back together with their families and constituents, a goal certainly that I share with them. But, nevertheless, the Committee on Rules arbitrarily sets in place this 4-hour limit. Unfortunately, in fact I think, Mr. Speaker, that my amendment is the only amendment that will be offered and that we will pursue that and see whether or not the fidelity of this group for American sovereignty carries through to commercial uses of the property for foreign countries and enti- ties that might want to mine, they might want to harvest trees and do other exploitative activities in the land. If there is any enthusiasm for saving American taxpayers and saving their resources for America, we will see whether or not we can sell that par- ticular idea. But there is no reason for putting a time limit on this bill. I think it is a reflection, unfortunately, of the cir- cumstances and the state of affairs that exists in this Congress today, in fact, in terms of what I say, a lack of trust between us, Mr. Speaker, which I think is unneeded. And, therefore, I will oppose this rule. I think it is not an open rule. It is a rule which has a time limitation, and I think it is unnecessary and this House should reject the rule. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous ques- tion on the resolution.

Pursuant to House Resolu- tion 180 and rule XVIII, the Chair de- clares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 883. /ballot1115 IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 883) to preserve the sovereignty of the United States over public lands and acquired lands owned by the United States, and to preserve State sovereignty and pri- vate property rights in non-Federal lands surrounding those public lands and acquired lands, with Mr. S TEARNS in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered as having been read the first time. Under the rule, the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Y OUNG ) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. V ENTO ) will each control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Y OUNG ). /ballot1115 Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair- man, I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair- man, H.R. 883, the American Land Sov- ereignty Protection Act, asserts the power of Congress on the Constitution over the lands belonging to the United States, and this is all this bill does. So that everyone understands, the concern here is the Congress and, therefore, the people. They are left out of the domestic process to designate World Heritage Sites and Biosphere Re- serves. This bill requires the participation, as the Constitution so states, that the Member of the Congress and the citi- zens of this Nation are in the process. Many, many Americans from all over, sections of our country, have called my office, I am sure they have called my colleagues also, to say they are concerned about the lack of con- gressional oversight over UNESCO international land reserves in the U.S. and to express support for this bill. Within the last 25 years, 83 sites in the United States have been designated as Biosphere Reserves, World Heritage Sites or Ramsar Sites, all with vir- tually no congressional oversight and no congressional hearings. The public and local governments have not be con- sulted. The World Heritage and Ramsar pro- grams are based on a treaty. H.R. 883 does not end U.S. participation in the World Heritage or Ramsar Sites. We have domestic laws implementing these programs, and H.R. 883 proposesto change these domestic laws so that Congress must approve the sites. The Biosphere Reserve Program is not authorized by even a single U.S. law or any international treaty. That is wrong. Executive Branch appointees, whatever their political party, cannot and should not do things that the law does not authorize, and I ask my col- leagues, what is unreasonable about Congress insisting that no land be des- ignated for inclusion in these inter- national land use programs without clear and direct approval of the Con- gress? What is unreasonable about having local citizens and public officials par- ticipate in decisions on designated land near their homes for inclusion in an international preserve? If the boundaries of a national park are forced to change, even by a small adjustment, Congress must approve the change. However, a 15.4 million acre South Appalachian Biosphere Reserve encompassing parts of six States stretching from northeast Alabama to southwest Virginia was created by unelected bureaucrats, bypassing the Congress, and this is unconstitutional and it is wrong. We need to reemphasize the congres- sional duty to keep international com- mitments from abridging traditional constitutional constraints. Otherwise the boundaries between our owners' lands and others or even between the government's land and private prop- erty are too easily and often ignored. H.R. 883 will also prevent attempts by the Executive Branch to use inter- national land designation to bypass the Congress in making land decisions and protect our domestic land use decision- making process from unnecessary international interference. We are going to hear a lot today from the other side and those that oppose it about this bill being driven by the fear of black helicopters and catering to suspicions and conspiracy theories of extremists. We will also hear a lot about the effectiveness and importance of the wonderful programs. We are also going to be told that these programs are honorary and have no effect on the use, management or disposition of pub- lic lands. However, the World Heritage Centre says otherwise. The director of the World Heritage Centre told the In- terior Department in a letter: ``Article 1 of the World Heritage Con- vention obligates the State Party to protect, conserve, present and transmit to future generations World Heritage Sites for which they are responsible. This obligation extends beyond the boundary of the site and Article 5(A) recommends the State Parties inte- grate the protection of sites into com- prehensive planning programmes. Thus, if proposed developments will damage the integrity of the Yellow- stone National Park, the State Party has a responsibility to act beyond the National Park boundary.'' Going beyond what Congress has set aside, I submit this decision as a re-sponsibility of Congress, not some U.N. committee of unelected bureaucrats. The public and local governments are almost never consulted about creating World Heritage Sites, the Ramsar Sites and Biosphere Reserves. Although pro- ponents of these programs always keep saying the designations are made at the request of local communities, des- ignation efforts are almost always driven by Federal agencies, usually the National Park Service. The Committee on Resources has not found one exam- ple where one of these designations was requested by a broad-based cross-sec- tion of either the public or local offi- cials. On the contrary, these programs usually face strong local opposition. In my State the Alaska State Legislature passed a resolution supporting H.R. 883, and I will urge my colleagues to listen to the debate, make their decision, but remember their constitutional duty, and that is to make us the designees of lands use. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I have a parliamentary inquiry. The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, when Members are speaking, charts are per- mitted to be displayed in the House Chamber and the Committee of the Whole; is that correct? The CHAIRMAN. With the permis- sion of the House, when the question is raised, that is correct. Mr. VENTO. And when Members have desisted from speaking, are charts still permitted to be displayed in the House? The CHAIRMAN. The charts are taken out of the well at that time. Mr. VENTO. Are they permitted to be in the other portions of the House and be displayed at that time? The CHAIRMAN. They should not be displayed anywhere in the Chamber un- less they are being used in the debate. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I think that there is a provision and the cus- tom of the House is that these matters may be displayed in the Speaker's Lobby; is that correct? The CHAIRMAN. That is permissible, with the Speaker's approval. Mr. VENTO. I thank the Chairman for his response to me. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 6 min- utes. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this bill. This is not new legislation. It, I think, has, and it is a case, as I said, where we have heard this tune before for the last two Congresses, and the House has passed this after spirited de- bate, and the fact is that it has gone to the Senate and not received consider- ation in the Senate; and I think the fact is that listening to the discussion of our distinguished chairman and his debate, and he is very good at debate, but the fact is that the words here do not match the music in terms of what takes place with this legislation. This is a bad bill. This really cuts the head off of these programs that theCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3403 May 20, 1999 United States has led in creating on a global basis over the last 25 or 30 years under President Nixon, under other Presidents that have served since then, both Democrat and Republican, Carter, Reagan, Ford; pardon me, Ford, and of course Bush and now President Clin- ton. These programs have been in ex- istence, and these administrations have supported them because it is a good program. It permits the United States to provide global leadership in terms of the preservation and con- servation of special areas such as World Heritage Sites, which are pro- tected because of their natural or cul- tural resources, Man and the Biosphere programs which some 600-and-some sites globally, only about 47 in the United States incidentally, which are used for scientific research, these eco- systems where scientists can gain in- formation, and of course, hopefully, we take that new knowledge and translate it into good public policy on a global basis. And finally, of course, areas like wet- lands areas like the Ramsar sites, which there are over 700 sites globally, only about 15 in the United States, again where we protect and provide areas for protection of various water- fall and other fauna and flora that hap- pen, obviously occur in these areas. Now my colleague and chairman, the distinguished chairman said that this is unconstitutional. Well, where is the court case? This has been in existence for 30 years. Where the court case that says that this is an action taken by one of these past administrations over the last 25 or 30 years, that says this is un- constitutional? We had a constitutional lawyer, I be- lieve Mr. Rufkin from Yale, that ap- peared before us. When he was asked that question, he was not able to come up with one court case, one decision that had been made that said that this was unconstitutional. This is not unconstitutional. These designations are made in the United States on a voluntary basis, just as they are around the globe. These are voluntary designations. The Congress has exercised its responsibility and done it well in most Congresses with regards to land use questions. In fact, we designated parks, we have des- ignated wildernesses, we have des- ignated and passed on and permit the agencies to designate on their own areas of environmental concern, for in- stance, in the BLM and many other areas. But the Congress has jealously guarded, and I would jealously guard, the right of Congress to, in fact, iden- tify and to designate these various lands for the purposes that we are en- trusted to do so, but the fact is that what we are saying here is that these areas have already been designated. Now the big complaint here really re- volves around Yellowstone and a mine that was occurring outside of Yellow- stone but in obviously the watershed of Yellowstone, and the fact of the matter is that area was designated a Man andthe Biosphere area for research, and it was pointed out that if that mine oc- curred, that it would adversely affect the entire hydrology and watershed and other natural factors in that area. And the fact is that we think and I think that the parks and other lands have an extra boundary responsibility, that they can go and talk about activi- ties outside the boundary of the parks, outside the boundary of a wilderness, outside boundaries. These trans-bound- ary issues are very important because we have to come to the realization that the de facto wilderness creation or park creation, that the areas that hap- pen at their margin, boundaries, are causing these parks to be and these special areas that we set aside to be ad- versely effected. That is what this is about. We al- ready designated them a park. We have already designated wilderness. But not being able to attack the parks and the wilderness and the other conservation areas that we designated directly, they choose to do it through this particular claim of American sovereignty and wrap themselves in that particular issue with, I guess, a strong distaste for the U.N. Mr. Chairman, this is one thing that the U.N. and UNESCO is doing right. This is one thing where past Presi- dents, both Democrats and Republicans and their administrations, have strong- ly supported. There are nearly 2,000 sites that have been designated and recognized by these international bod- ies just in these three treaty areas or protocol agreements that we have here, just in these three, but there may be others affected by this legislation. In the United States there are only 82 of those. Our leadership has done a magnifi- cent job here. Let us keep the United States in the forefront of it. Let us re- ject this bill. Mr. Chairman, H.R. 883 is not new legisla- tion. The Congress first considered this idea in 1996, and then again in 1997. In both in- stances, the other body refused to consider this measure on the floor and the Administra- tion indicated it would veto the measure if passed. Why? Because they don't have vi- sions of blue helmets dancing through their heads. H.R. 883 is misguided because it is aimed at the symbols of a federal policy when, what the supporters of the legislation really oppose, is the underlying policy itself. While some of my colleagues and I might like to see us doing even more, this country has set as a national policy goal\u00d0the long-term preservation of our environmental resources. The commitment this Nation has made to this preservation/con- servation/restoration policy sometimes de- mands that certain activities which threaten these resources be prohibited, and/or tightly limited by us and no one else. The reality of the circumstance regarding these voluntary agreements is that no blue helmets will come parachuting behind national park lines in black helicopters to seize control of American lands all in the name of preservation or conserva- tion. Besides, after today we may have made a statement as to a crack missile defense sys-tem to thwart any and all attempts to seize the sovereignty of our great Nation by those inter- national agents of evil. Any and all land use the restrictions in place are functions of U.S. law, not an international treaty or protocol. Our participation in the World Heritage Convention, the Ramsar Con- vention and the Man and the Biosphere pro- gram is emblematic of this underlying policy and the symbolic value and importance the U.S. places on its natural resources, our nat- ural legacy. The twenty sites we have nomi- nated under the World Heritage Convention are listed because Congress chose to enact policy and law to protect them, and establish special land managers to regulate and enforce such law. To address a specific example that gave rise to this bill, the problem with the New World Mine was that it was, in fact, too close to Yellowstone National Park, not that it was too close to a World Heritage site. If we want to debate the basic principles of environmental protection, that's fine. But, we should not waste our time passing legislation that seeks to abolish the programs which grow out of these basic principles which have evolved over 200 years of American land use ethic. Quite simply, this legislation turns logic on its head. Let's be clear\u00d0the goal of H.R. 883 is to abandon these programs, not simply to regu- late them. To require an Act of Congress for each and every parcel of land to be consid- ered, is to effectively stop all future nomina- tions and designations. This legislation sends a signal around the world that our nation, the United States of America, which forged the policy path to insti- tute the World Heritage Convention, is under- cutting the values and benefits of international recognition for important cultural and environ- mental sites. At a time when the United States is thrust into a role as the dominant power and an essential role as a world leader in so many areas\u00d0why would we voluntarily abdicate per- haps the most important leadership position we occupy\u00d0that of a leader in the effort to make life on this planet sustainable. This would convey to the hundreds of nations part of the conservation treaties and protocol agreements, that domestic political consider- ations come first. If the U.S. cannot even per- mit recognition to be accorded, why should other nations? Why are we pursuing legislation that is mis- directed and misguided and based solely on gross misinformation? Each agreement cov- ered by this bill states on its face that it con- tains no provision that affects, in any way, the authority or ability of a participating nation to control the lands within its border. These pro- grams give the UN no more control over land in this country than the awarding of a gold medal gives the U.S. Olympic Committee con- trol over an American athlete. To claim that these international programs somehow infringe on the sovereignty of this nation is simply fac- tually inaccurate. Finally, the largest threat to this nation's sovereignty isn't even addressed. Any foreign company or their subsidiary is still given full and free access for any and all of America's valuable natural resources. Each year we watch $1.8 billion worth of gold and silver stream out of our ports and into the coffers of foreign owned companies. What's worse, while we debate this phantom legislation, for- eign nations are cashing in big-time, andCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3404 May 20, 1999 laughing all the way to the bank with our re- sources. I will introduce an amendment to cor- rect this situation and bring balance back to the management of our natural resources. Mr. Chairman, this is an issue of takings, not of private property, but of the stripped international recognition and esteem the citi- zens of the United States, and the world place on some of America's most stunning and eco- logically important natural resources. Teddy Roosevelt ushered in a new era of conserva- tion and respect for the natural heritage of the United States at the beginning of the twentieth century. How ironic it is that nearly a century later this Nation may come full circle and, if this legislation passes, denounce the impor- tance of those very parks and resources on which the heritage of this nation is based. I would urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 883. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 3 minutes to the gentle- woman from Wyoming (Mrs. C UBIN). Mrs. CUBIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 883, and I thank the chairman and the committee staff for getting this bill done in such good form and to the floor so quickly. I am glad that I am speaking right after the gentleman from Minnesota because he made the statement that we all know this is about Yellowstone Na- tional Park, and I represent Wyoming which has the most of Yellowstone Na- tional Park, and he said that the U.N. is doing a good job by these designa- tions, that the reason that Yellowstone was designated, because a mine was going to be developed north of Yellow- stone that might affect the watershed. Mr. Chairman, let me tell my col- leagues the rest of the story. For 2 years an environmental impact state- ment had been going on, and profes- sional scientists were not able in 2 years time to determine whether or not that developing that mine would put Yellowstone National Park in jeop- ardy. /ballot1130 They were working toward that, but they still had more work to do before they professionally could say that was true. In 3 days' time, the United Nations came in. Three days later they deter- mined that this indeed was an area in jeopardy, and then it was designated an area in jeopardy. So if that is what the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. V ENTO ) thinks is a good job, I certainly would have to disagree with him. I do agree with him, however, on the fact that what this argument boils down to are these transboundary issues. As far back as 1818, the United States Supreme Court ruled in the United States v. Bevins that a State's right to control property within its borders was an essential part of its sov- ereignty, and I think that H.R. 883 is yet another affirmation of that prin- ciple. What was done when this des- ignation was made around Yellowstone was it virtually built a buffer zone around Yellowstone. It is something the administration had been trying to do for a long timebut they could not get it done legisla- tively, even though it is clearly legisla- tive responsibility to designate public land use. So they went around the back door and had the U.N. committee in 3 days make that designation. This is a good bill. This is something that Americans have the right, the Congress has the right and the respon- sibility to make these designations, and all we are asking is that these des- ignations be approved by the Congress. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 883. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gen- tleman from California (Mr. F ARR). Mr. FARR of California. Mr. Chair- man, I thank the gentleman from Min- nesota (Mr. V ENTO ) for yielding me this time. Mr. Chairman, I rise in total opposi- tion to this bill because there is abso- lutely nothing out there that is broken that needs fixing. This addresses a problem that does not exist. Let me say I know something about this issue because I own land that is designated by this. I own an inholding in the University of California property in Big Sur, California. We are proud of this designation. One cannot get a des- ignation unless the landowner, in this case it would be the Federal Govern- ment for National Parks or for Bureau of Land Management lands, or in our case a private owner, has to request the nomination. That is the only way it can come is from the owner of the land to say we would like to partici- pate in the program. The program is essentially an inter- national way of being able to have a common database about measurement of environmental factors, so that we can see whether there are like kind of factors around the world, there are like kinds of problems or are the problems that are developing in an area signifi- cant to that area. To go out and say that we should have congressional approval for these designations is so ludicrous. I mean, why do we not have congressional ap- proval and oversight for accreditation of universities? That is not done by Congress, or by any government. Why do we not have the AAA, the guides that go around and say that one can sleep in these hotels and motels, we do not have any congressional oversight of that. We do not have any congres- sional oversight of TV Guide or the motion picture movie ratings. We do not have any oversight of the Good Housekeeping or Consumer Reports Magazine. We do not demand that we have to look at these things. Why? They are not a problem where one wants to involve congressional ac- tion in this thing. To say that we should have Congress telling our local communities and States that they cannot have their property so designated, I think, is to- tally wrong. It is a usurpation of local control. If the chairman would like to have Alaska properties and have Glacier Na-tional Park and have the Denali Na- tional Forest exempted, then he can do that for the State of Alaska, but for California we have community local water districts in Marin County; we have private lands in California; we have State parks in California. All of those requested to be part of this sys- tem because we want to be better in- formed, we want to be educated. We are not part of this flat earth society that is afraid of learning about something. So this bill would deny our ability to get that nomination because one would have to go through this incredible con- gressional process. We cannot even pass legislation here to keep the coun- try running. How are we going to make decisions on whether somebody should be able to voluntarily be placed in an international information system? This is a ludicrous bill. Please defeat it. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair- man, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to re- mind the gentleman from California (Mr. F ARR), who just spoke, who is a dear friend of mine, that the landowner in Yellowstone did not request that participation in the World Heritage Program. In fact, she opposed it and unfortunately she was not listened to. In our hearings in New York, we had people that came to the committee and said that, yes, the Federal Government was trying to implement Heritage sites in their districts and they adamantly opposed it. It is happening right today in Lake Champlain. So what I am just suggesting is as much as I admire the sincerity of the gentleman, I would like to have him look at some of the records. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. H ANSEN ). (Mr. HANSEN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. HANSEN. Mr. Chairman, I stand in strong support of this legislation. Mr. Chairman, Thomas Jefferson once said ``When all government, domestic and foreign, in little as in great things, shall be drawn to Washington as the center of all power, it . .. will become as venal and oppressive as the government from which we separated.'' The current system for establishing international land reserves ignores Jefferson's warning by centralizing the power with the President and taking away the authority of Congress, the States and the average citizen. During the last 25 years, our nation's public lands have slowly been consumed by inter- national land reserves. Most notably 47 United Nations Biosphere Reserves, 20 World Herit- age Sites and 16 Ramsar Sites. These re- serves were created with virtually no congres- sional oversight, no hearings, and in the case of biosphere reserves, no legislative authority. I don't know about you Mr. Chairman, but my ability to represent my constituents as a voting member of this body is important to me! We cannot allow this administration to take our vote away. I ask that you support the Amer- ican Land Sovereignty Protection Act.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3405 May 20, 1999 Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair- man, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. FARR of California. Mr. Chair- man, will the gentleman yield? Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. FARR of California. Mr. Chair- man, if that is the case then I would suggest within his authority as chair- man of the Committee on Resources that the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. YOUNG ) may want to just limit this then to Federal properties and not to State and local properties or private properties. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. I believe my bill does that. It does limit it just to Federal properties. Mr. Chairman, I yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. EMERSON ). Mrs. EMERSON. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. 883. I do want to say to my friend, the gen- tleman from California (Mr. F ARR), that I know that there are many places that perhaps are honored to have these designations bestowed upon them. On the other hand, in my district, a des- ignation was going to be thrust upon people without any local input and I think that is what this legislation is trying to clarify. I do want to thank the gentleman from Alaska (Chairman Y OUNG ) for his strong leadership on this issue and, in fact, the leadership he shows on many private property rights issues, and the work that he has done on behalf of pri- vate property owners. I would also like to extend a similar thanks to the gentlewoman from Idaho (Mrs. C HENOWETH ), who chairs the Sub- committee on Forests and Forest Health, who has been a devoted cham- pion of private property rights. She re- cently came to my district in southern Missouri to represent the Committee on Resources and to chair a hearing on the legislation we are talking about today. We heard from a lot of local people, farmers, county officials, ranchers, small businesspeople, property owners, those people who have the most at stake when international land designa- tion issues arises. Let me just talk a little bit about what the gentlewoman from Idaho (Mrs. C HENOWETH ) and I learned during the recent field hearing in the Missouri Ozarks, but I am just going to take a second before that to talk about how I became involved in this issue. Back in 1996, as I was traveling across my district, in every single lit- tle town in the center of my district, which is part of the Mark Twain Na- tional Forest, in which there is tour- ism that really promotes the local economy and some timber sales every- where, Ellington, Van Buren, Salem, to name a few, people were concerned about these designations and particu- larly about something called the Ozark Man and the Biosphere program that basically would take 15 Missouri andArkansas counties and put them into a biosphere reserve. Let me say there was no local input involved whatsoever, and that my folks had to scrape and claw their way to find out anything about this. They were simply tipped off one day by a friend on the conservation commission. The amazing thing was, when they went to the agencies, the Department of Interior, specifically to ask about exactly what was happening, the Inte- rior Department said, do not worry about this; it was going to be fine; we have talked to lots of local citizens around the district. Well, the fact of the matter is, every single county in my district that would be impacted by this had absolutely no public solicitation by the Interior De- partment, Fish and Wildlife, whomever was involved, whatsoever. Not one county commissioner was called, not one local citizens group, and it was not until we had enough cattlemen's asso- ciations, enough farm bureau associa- tions and finally all of the county com- missions writing their own resolutions that this was a bad idea that the des- ignation was dropped and these 15 counties in Missouri and Arkansas were saved from having to have a bio- sphere reserve designation put on them because, quite frankly, my citizens were afraid that once the designation happened then the government would find more and more reasons to seize the contiguous property around, and that would be their private property. I think this really shows that we have a broken process and that experi- ence makes the case for our bill today. All this bill would do would be to es- tablish an appropriate process for bio- spheres and heritage area designations and ensure that local input and partici- pation of Congress is involved. I do not think that is asking too much. I think it is very, very reasonable. I will say, back when the gentle- woman from Idaho (Mrs. C HENOWETH ) and I were in Missouri, we heard from 12 different panelists, one of whom was a county commissioner; one was the former chairman of the Missouri Con- servation Commission; several private citizens, but Leon Kreisler, who was a cattleman, and a landowner in Salem, Missouri, said, and I quote, ``We feel strongly about property rights not be- cause we share a common desire to abuse our natural resources but be- cause landowners are often best suited to ensure productivity for our families and those of future generations. The Ozarks are a natural wonder and we in- tend to keep them that way, but na- tional or international designations are not the answer.'' Mr. Kreisler makes the point that I would like to reiterate, that our farm- ers and our ranchers are among the best conservationists anywhere be- cause they depend on the land for their livelihood and they know that if they do not take care of the land then the land is not going to take care of them. We had also an owner from a sawmill in Potosi, Missouri. He spent 20 yearsas an analyst for Price Waterhouse be- fore buying the sawmill. Needless to say, Carl Barnes, the sawmill owner, talked about the threats from this coordinated resource management system and the threats that this would have upon outdoor recreation because they listed farming and mining as threats to outdoor recre- ation and our ecosystem health. The fact of the matter is we can do it all, and I think that we do it all re- sponsibly. We simply need to have this program put in place so that local citi- zens who live in areas for proposed des- ignations have input, that is all it is, and that Congress have input, too. I urge a yes vote on H.R. 883. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gen- tleman from Colorado (Mr. U DALL ), a member of the Committee on Re- sources. Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Chair- man, I want to thank my colleague, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. VENTO ), for yielding me the time. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this bill. This bill would undo some of the most important progress that has been achieved toward protection of internationally important cultural, historical and environmental re- sources. What would enactment of this bill mean? Well, for starters, it would mean that the United States has decided to politicize the question of whether our country will continue to take part in the World Heritage Convention, the Man and the Biosphere Program, and the so-called Ramsar Convention re- garding wetlands that have particular importance as waterfowl habitat. That might not be objectionable if our par- ticipation in these international pro- grams involved any trade-offs in terms of our ability to make decisions about the management of our lands or re- sources, but the fact is that nothing in these international agreements affects the ownership or the management of any lands or other resources. Similarly, I could understand the need for this legislation if, as some of its supporters claim, these inter- national agreements have eaten away at the power and sovereignty of the Congress to exercise its constitutional power to make the laws that govern Federal lands, but here we are debating a bill that would be an exercise of ex- actly that constitutional power, and that constitutional power is fully in- tact today, fully intact with regard to each and every acre of Federal lands, including all the Federal lands that are covered by these international agree- ments. So what is the real point of this bill? As far as I can tell, it is primarily a means for supporters to take a shot at the United Nations and particularly UNESCO, and to demonstrate their sol- idarity with some who seem to view the U.N. as engaged in a vast multiwing conspiracy to overthrow our constitutional government. I do notCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3406 May 20, 1999 think the U.N. is a threat to Congress' authority over Federal lands or to any other part of the Constitution. I do think this bill, if we take it seriously, is a threat to America's international leadership in environmental conserva- tion and in the protection of historical and cultural resources. /ballot1145 So I think this bill is bad for our country, and I know it is bad for my home State of Colorado. I want to tell my colleagues about the two Biosphere Reserves that we have, areas that are part of the Man and the Biosphere Program. One is the Niwot Ridge Research area and the other is Rocky Mountain National Park. As it now stands, this bill would kick those areas out of the program unless Congress passes a new law to re- tain them. To get a better idea of what that would mean for Niwot Ridge, I con- tacted Professor Bowman, the Director of the University of Colorado's Moun- tain Research Station, and he ex- plained to me that having Niwot Ridge in the Biosphere Reserve System, it provided a framework for international cooperation of many important re- search efforts, including working with the Biosphere Reserve in the Czech Re- public to address air pollution prob- lems, which is a matter of great impor- tance not only to us, but to the Czechs. He told me that the biosphere program also had been helpful to people at Niwot Ridge as they worked with the Forest Service to develop a land man- agement plan that would promote mul- tiple use by minimizing the conflicts that we all grapple with here over recreation and scientific and other uses, which is again a matter of great importance to Colorado and all other public land States. I also talked to the National Park Service about Rocky Mountain Na- tional Park, which again is included as a biosphere reserve. They told me that it not only means that there are more research activities at the park, but that it meant a significant increase in park visitation, tourism, which not only provides important educational benefits but is an important part of our economy in Colorado. Kicking these areas out of the program would be bad for Colorado and something that I can- not support. Exempting the Colorado areas from the bill would be an improvement, but I do not think that alone would make the bill acceptable. We need to reject this bill, move away from the pos- turing and begin working on the real problems that face us on our public lands. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 2 minutes to the gen- tleman from Washington (Mr. NETHERCUTT ). Mr. NETHERCUTT. Mr. Chairman. I am delighted to support this bill, the American Land Sovereignty Protection Act. I really want to thank the gen-tleman from Alaska for his efforts in this regard. He has been a champion of private property rights for many years, I have known him for 23 years, and I re- spect him greatly. I represent the east side of the State of Washington, one-fourth of the size of our State, and in that portion of the State of Washington there are wonder- ful open space lands that people in- habit who are very protective of their private property rights. The right to own property is a core principle on which our country was founded. Over the years, the Federal Government has established programs like the World Heritage Sites and Bio- sphere Reserves, without the approval of Congress, Mr. Chairman, and that overrides the intentions of the Con- stitution and our Founding Fathers. Under the U.S. Constitution, Con- gress retains the power to, quote, ``make all needful rules and regula- tions governing lands belonging to the United States.'' The lands designated under the World Heritage Sites and Biosphere Reserves have been so des- ignated without the approval of Con- gress. So this bill restores the intentions of our Founding Fathers by requiring congressional approval for any nomina- tion of property located in the United States for inclusion in the World Herit- age list. It prohibits any Federal offi- cial from nominating U.S. property for designation as a biosphere reserve and prohibits any Federal official from des- ignating any land in the U.S. for a spe- cial or restricted use under any inter- national agreement unless the designa- tion has been authorized by law. It simply says Congress is going to be involved in this, these approvals of the disposition of Federal lands. I think they are common sense changes here that restore the role of Congress in the process of changing designation of lands that are Federal lands, and it re- stores the intentions of our Founding Fathers, and I hope that my colleagues will support it. I thank the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Y OUNG ) and the gentlewoman from Idaho (Mrs. C HENOWETH ) for their en- gagement and involvement in this. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Penn- sylvania (Mr. H OEFFEL ). Mr. HOEFFEL. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the American Land Sovereignty Pro- tection Act. This bill is unnecessary, it is unjustified. It addresses a phantom problem. It would seriously damage our country's continued participation in important international efforts to pro- tect valuable land around the world. But worst of all, it caters to the sus- picions and the conspiracy theories of extreme organizations and individuals, and it leads directly to scare tactics such as those used by the American Policy Center in attempts to alarm American citizens and frankly, to raisemoney under false pretenses, and this bill ought to be opposed and defeated. I would like to read from a letter from the American Policy Center which I will include for the R ECORD at the end of my statement. This is a let- ter written by the American Policy Center, signed by Tom DeWeese, the president, urging citizens to send money in to pass this bill, H.R. 883, to ``stop the U.N. land grab of American soil,'' a land grab, Mr. Chairman, that does not exist; urging citizens and this Congress to stop the U.N. from desig- nating any more U.S. soil as World Heritage Sites or Biosphere Reserves. The U.N. does not make those designa- tions, Mr. Chairman. It identifies a U.N. land grab of American soil; calls for the Congress to stop liberals from terminating the United Nations' influence on 51 million acres of U.S. park land. Mr. Chairman, the U.N. does not have influence over 51 million acres of United States na- tional park land. It says that liberals know this bill will lead to the end of international treaties and agreements that give the U.N. control over devel- opment of American soil. There are no such international treaties and agree- ments, nor should there be, nor would this Congress vote for, nor would any President negotiate such international treaties. It is just bogus. The letter talks about radicals like ALGORE and Bruce Babbitt that en- force treaties in a way that give the U.N. authority over our land and our private property every day. G OREand Babbitt are not radicals and they are not doing any such thing. This letter talks about open warfare in coming weeks to pass this bill. Mr. DeWeese talks about meeting with the gen- tleman from Alaska (Mr. Y OUNG ) and saying that the American Policy Cen- ter will back him all the way in the battle to pass this bill. Of course, then Mr. DeWeese goes to the heart of the matter and asks for any contribution from $17 to $1,000 to help the American Policy Center in their efforts. Mr. Chairman, this bill is not needed. We should oppose it. It is nothing but scare tactics from the right wing. We should vote ``no.'' AMERICAN POLICY CENTER , Herndon, VA. DEAR FRIEND OF APC: I have just come from an emergency meeting on Capitol Hill, and I have important news for you. I was meeting with several national lead- ers to plan a strategy to pass Congressman Don Young's ``American Land Sovereignty Protection Act'' (H.R. 883). As I'm sure you remember, we were suc- cessful last year in passing this bill in the House of Representatives to stop the UN land grab of American Soil. But we were stopped cold in the U.S. Sen- ate. We didn't even get a hearing on the Sen- ate version of the Bill. Because the Senate did not act, we have to start all over again and pass it again in the House, while we build strength in the Senate. We intend to win this time. We intend to pass the Bill in both Houses of Congress and stop the UN from designating any more U.S.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3407 May 20, 1999 soil as World Heritage Sites or Biosphere Re- serves. We believe Congressman Young has the votes to pass it again in the House. In fact, he already has 158 co-sponsors, with more joining each day. He also has the support of new House Speaker Dennis Hastert. The problem, again, is in the Senate. Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colo- rado has again agreed to introduce the ``American Land Sovereignty Protection Act in the Senate. The Bill number is S. 510. But Senator Campbell has only been able to sign on six co-sponsors. Without more support, S. 510 will again die in the Senate. You and I can't let that happen. Not again. You and I need to storm the Senate. Here's how. First, I have enclosed a ``Legislative Peti- tion'' to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. He will be key in the fight to build support in the Senate. Frankly, without his support there can be no floor vote on S. 510. That's why it is urgent that you imme- diately sign and return your ``Legislative Pe- tition'' to me right away. You and I must flood Lott's office with petitions to prove S. 510 has strong national support. So please sign you petition and return it to me immediately. But you and I can't stop there. Senator Campbell needs more co-sponsors for the Bill. Please call both of your states U.S. Senators and ask them to co-sponsor S. 510. Simply call the Senate switchboard at 202\u00b1224\u00b13121, and ask for your Senators by name. Just as important, however is that you contact you Congressman to make sure he supports Congressman Young's House version (H.R. 883). We must have a strong show in the House as well. If not, all of our efforts in the Senate will be in vain. So please, call your Congressman at 202\u00b1 225\u00b13121. Tell him to support H.R. 883. It is vital that you do all you can\u00d0if we are going to stop the UN's land grab of American soil. To win, you and I will have to beat overwhelming odds. But don't despair. You and I can win this battle. Remember when the fight to stop the UN land grab started in the 104th Congress? Democrats refused to even attend hearings. They laughed and called Congressman Young's bill the ``black helicopter'' bill. They called it ``preposterous,'' ``absurd'' and ``crazy.'' The very idea that someone was challenging the UN was laughable to them. They're not laughing now. The liberals know they must stop the bill. And they know the Senate is their last chance. Liberals know this bill will termi- nate United Nations' influence on 51 million acres of U.S. national parklands. Liberals know this bill will gut the ex- tremist United Nations' environmental agen- da and will lead to the end of international treaties and agreements that give the UN control over development of American soil. Liberals know this bill forces them to take a side. Do liberals support your right to own and control your private property or not? The bill exposes the left's property-grab- bing agenda. It weakens to United Nations' influence in the world. That's why they know they must stop the American Land Sovereignty Protection Act at all costs. So, right now, the Sierra Club, the Audu- bon Society, the Nature Conservancy and all of their extremist environmental buddies are charging up Capitol Hill, swarming over Sen- ate offices, using all of their power to keep this Bill from gaining co-sponsors or a floor vote. They know we can pass this bill. Our posi- tion is strong.The whole purpose of the American Sov- ereignty Protection Act is to restore the role of Congress where it should have been all along\u00d0as the administrator with sovereign control over public lands in the United States. That authority has been slowly eroded over the years by a series of environmental treaties and agreements that subject our public lands to the influences of UN officials and UN-dictated rules. And with the help of the Clinton Administration. Those rules not only tell the United States what it must do with public lands\u00d0but they also affect private property as well. Just ask the owner of the gold mine that was located outside Yellowstone National Park. He was on private land\u00d0his land. Now he's out of business. Why? Because the United Nations said so. And these UN treaties, like the Biodiver- sity Treaty and the World Heritage Sites are incredibly dangerous when radicals like Vice President Al Gore and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt hold power. They can enforce the treaties in a way that gives the UN authority over our land and our private property. And they are doing it every day. The House of Representatives recognized the danger and passed Don Young's Bill in the 105th Congress. They know that the threat is real, and we can pass the Bill in the House again in the 106th Congress. But the real battle is now in the Senate. And I tell you with complete honesty\u00d0we will have to fight like the Dickens to with- stand the coming liberal firestorm. The lib- erals will use everything in their arsenal to stop this Bill. And the Senate is not a friend- ly place for property owners. Get ready for open warfare. It's coming. In the next few weeks. At our meeting today, I promised Con- gressman Young that APC would back him all the way in the battle to pass the Amer- ican Land Sovereignty Protection Act. And I meant it. That includes leading the fight in the Senate. Your enclosed ``Legislative Petition'' is my first step. Please. It is urgent that you sign it and return it to me today. We simply must build pressure on Trent Lott to support the Bill. That's why it's also important that you begin making phone calls to your Senators and Congressman to ask them to co-sponsor and support the bills (H.R. 883 and S. 510). Over the coming weeks APC will get this message to hundreds of thousands of Ameri- cans to build the pressure. You and I can pass this bill and cut the power of the UN! But to do it, I urgently need your financial support. Will you help me keep up this fight to save America from the UN land grab? I've been appearing on radio and television programs and speaking before audiences across this nation to sound the alarm on the UN land grab. The response is incredible. When Americans know the truth\u00d0they do the right thing. But they are not hearing most of this story from anyone but the American Policy Center. But, through APC's effort, we are truly awakening a slumbering giant. Will you help me stay in the fight by send- ing me your most generous contribution of at least $17? Remember, the Sierra Club and their bud- dies have millions of dollars in their war chest. I have only you. So if you can send a larger donation of $25, $50, $100, $250, $500, or even $1,000, I will be able to counter the lib- eral barrage, word for word. You know APC's record and what we can do when our action alert system is firing on all cylinders. But it takes dollars to fuel the engine. I need you now. There really is nomore important legislation before the U.S. Congress than the American Land Sov- ereignty Protection Act. The bill truly is the whole ball game for our property rights. Pass it\u00d0and the UN is less of a threat. That's why the liberals hate it with a passion. Now is the time. This is the battle. Please help me win it. Sincerely, TOMDEWEESE, President. P.S. You and I will not fight a more impor- tant battle in 1999 than this one to pass the American Land Sovereignty Protection Act. It is crucial that I receive your signed ``Leg- islative Petition'' right away. Equally im- portant is your financial support to keep APC in the battle. Without you, I can do nothing. Please help. Thanks for all you do. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair- man, how much time remains? The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Y OUNG ) has 131\u00a42min- utes remaining; the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. V ENTO ) has 15 minutes remaining. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 3 minutes to the gen- tleman from Arkansas (Mr. H UTCH - INSON ). Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Alaska for yielding and for his work on this legis- lation. I do rise in support of it. I want to respond to the gentleman from Pennsylvania as to what he indi- cated about this. I agree that there has been, and there always will be, over- statements about the dangers of poten- tial actions that are taken, and in this case the dangers of the Biosphere Pro- gram. But the argument has been made that the United Nation's designation is important because it provides some international protections for these worldwide important sites. Well, if it provides some protections, then there is some implied authority, if not direct authority, that is yielded to that inter- national body; otherwise, the designa- tion would have no significance. If it has no significance, then why would anyone oppose this simple legislation. I have a habit in this Congress of try- ing to read legislation, and I took the time to read this bill that has been of- fered by the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Y OUNG ), H.R. 883, and it says, ``Any designation as a Biosphere Re- serve under the Man and Biosphere Program of UNESCO shall not be given any force or effect unless the Biosphere Reserve is specifically authorized by a law.'' Now, the argument is made, well, why should Congress engage in this ac- tivity? Well, I voted on naming postal buildings; I voted on naming Federal buildings; we vote on postage stamps. So there is a lot of designations that we do in this Congress. I believe that private ownership of property is important. I believe that our National Heritage Sites, our parks are very important, and I think that Congress has a role, and when the con- stituents express a concern about a particular designation, that it is right and proper in this democracy for Con- gress to address it.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3408 May 20, 1999 The Ozark Highland Man and Bio- sphere Plan was advanced in northern Arkansas and southern Missouri with- out public input. It was withdrawn after property owners, timber pro- ducers and other residents in the re- gion learned of and opposed the des- ignation. I believe the Chairman's bill is rea- sonable. I believe it is appropriate. I believe it maintains the balance be- tween executive action and legislative authority and certainly, when our con- stituents have a concern about these types of designations, that it is appro- priate that we have congressional over- sight and input into that process. So I ask my colleagues to support this im- portant legislation. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Wash- ington (Mr. I NSLEE ), a member of the Committee on Resources. Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in vigorous opposition to H.R. 883, which really ought to be titled the American Land Paranoia Act, because the principal purpose of this act is to sow paranoia among Americans who ought to take pride in our interest in protecting some of our national treas- ures. I will tell my colleagues that this is not a small matter. Some may think this is a small mat- ter, we should not worry about it. I want to tell my colleagues a little story. I was up on the border of the State of Washington and Canada about three years ago, four years ago now; in fact it was in what used to be the dis- trict of the gentleman from Wash- ington (Mr. N ETHERCUTT ). I was talking to a fellow who was a businessperson, a nice fellow, a pillar of the community. He lives about 10 miles from the Cana- dian border. We got in a nice little dis- cussion at a county fair. He said, ``Jay, what are you going to do about those tanks the U.N. has up on those railroad cars just over the Ca- nadian border?'' And I kind of chuck- led. I said, ``Henry, what are you talk- ing about?'' He said, ``Well, you know, those tanks that the U.N. has across the border that they are going to use to come in to establish this United Na- tions park in the North Cascades.'' I laughed. Then I saw he was serious. He was serious. And the reason he was serious is that the advocates of things like this bill have convinced this gen- tleman and a lot of people in America that somehow the tanks with the blue helmets and the black helicopters are coming to take away their livelihood, and that is flat wrong. Flat wrong. This is no unconstitutional loss. Mr. Chairman, we sat in the hearings and I was engaged with the committee on hearings on this. People came for- ward and they sent to us this law pro- fessor or lawyer, I do not know if he is a professor, and he argued for 10 min- utes passionately about how this vio- lated the Constitution of America. Then I asked him a simple question. I said, ``How long has this been on the books?'' He said, ``Well, since the late1960s.'' Then I asked him, ``Well, have you ever gone to court to ask for this to be ruled unconstitutional, the loss of sovereignty?'' He said, ``Well, no.'' The reason he has never done it is he knows darn well it is not unconstitu- tional. This is a bunch of flimflam where people are trying to foist these fears on the American people. The last point I want to make, the World Heritage Convention that is under attack here as some kind of so- cialist plot was introduced under the administration of Richard Nixon. Rich- ard Nixon came up with this socialist plot, and it is something that has been effective to try to get international at- tention to help us in this country pre- serve what we believe are our national treasures. This is another sad step of my friends across the aisle, frankly, leaving that tradition of Teddy Roosevelt and even Richard Nixon. We ought to keep this thing on the books as it is and reject this bill. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 11\u00a42minutes to the gen- tleman from Colorado (Mr. T ANCREDO ). Mr. TANCREDO. Mr. Chairman, I am the newest member of the Committee on Resources, and I would like to com- mend my distinguished colleague from the great State of Alaska (Mr. Y OUNG ) for his leadership in introducing this bill. Under Article IV, section 3 of the Constitution, quote, ``The Congress shall have the power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other prop- erty belonging to the United States.'' /ballot1200 Mr. Chairman, the Constitution is clear. The United Nations, despite ef- forts by its supporters, is not a gov- erning body superior in authority to this Congress. I know that comes as a shock to some of my colleagues in this place and certainly some of the supporters from whom I have heard, who believe that the United Nations has some superior claim to the sovereignty of the United States, particularly when it comes to determining what is the appropriate use of the land within our borders. It is, however, not, as I say, not a supe- rior authority to this Congress. Yet, the U.N. is designating land within our country's borders for special protection without the consent of the House. There are 83 U.N. sites in America, Mr. Chairman. In my home State of Colorado there are five United Nations biosphere reserves. I can tell the Mem- bers, having served in the Colorado State legislature for many years, those sites were designated without the ex- press consent of the State of Colorado and without the Congress of the United States. I have visited many of these areas. I agree they are incredible and breath- taking. I agree they are a treasure, butthey are the property of the United States, and we must maintain absolute autonomy in our land management de- cisions. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bill, and urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, again, I rise in opposi- tion to this bill. I would just point out to my colleagues that the only power with regard to the disposition or the use of the lands that are within these designations are inherent in the laws that Congress has passed and delegated to the Park Service, to the Fish and Wildlife Service, the BLM, the Forest Service, or other land managers to manage. In fact, this is a voluntary thing. All of these designations that are being discussed here, whether it is the Ramsar treaty or the Man and the Bio- sphere, which happens to be the pro- gram associated with the UNESCO pro- gram, or the World Heritage Conven- tion and the sites that are identified, only some 15 sites in the United States, are all voluntary. The laws that govern these sites are the laws of the national and State gov- ernments, and the private property rights and laws are completely intact. They are not changed by these vol- untary designations. In fact, when making the designations or the rec- ognition of these sites on a global basis, one of the criteria is in fact that the laws and rules are in place that will accord the proper use of these lands. So that is one of the pre- requisites. I would point out that the laws that affected the New World Mine were those that were being applied through the Park Service and the Forest Serv- ice in the State of Wyoming, in the State of Montana, and the other States within which Yellowstone lies. The point is that there is no impact. The impact here, of course, is one of cooperation and collaboration, building on the laws that we have and attempt- ing to encourage other Nations to in fact emulate the stewardship, the con- servation, and preservation efforts that we have made in terms of these impor- tant sites, because they are important as a natural heritage site or cultural site or because they are important for research or for water fall. So the only issue here is one where we could say that the Man and the Bio- sphere program has not directly been authorized by Congress, although we have appropriated money for it. We have many laws today where the authorization has expired or has not been made, where the Office of Manage- ment and Budget, because money is ap- propriated, the courts have ruled that in fact it has the force and effect of in fact Congress authorizing and lawfully permitting that type of designation, and we have done that for that pro- gram, clearly a case we made to bring up an authorization bill and deal with it in that manner.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3409 May 20, 1999 But that has not been the disposition of the committee. What they have cho- sen to do, of course, is because, in my judgment, they cannot attack the parks, they cannot attack some of the land uses which they have an issue with directly, they have turned around and wrapped themselves in this ques- tion of sovereignty, which there is no constitutional case here. There is no court case here that has been pursued that has been positive that would indi- cate the statements being made are ac- curate. They are not accurate. They have never been tested in court. I think they are inaccurate. They can test such issues in court and get answers back as to whether they are appropriate. In fact, this has been praised by many. I just picked up a statement here, a press release by Secretary of In- terior Don Hodel, most recently, of course, who led the Christian Coali- tion, but before that he worked in the State of Washington and on Bonneville Power, and was our Secretary of Inte- rior under then President Ronald Reagan. This letter was dated October 10, 1986, a press release in which he stated how enthusiastic and proud the Department was of the Statue of Liberty which was designated a World Heritage Site. So I think this just sort of indicates across the board how important this is. This is why all of the environmental groups and conservation groups oppose this legislation. I will offer an amendment in this process, Mr. Chairman, which will ad- dress some real concerns, and that is the commercial use by foreign entities of U.S. properties for mining, for graz- ing, for timber harvesting. If we are so concerned about the pres- ervation and conservation of these areas, then maybe we should really be concerned about those what we call exploitive activities that go on on these lands by foreign powers, actual activities, rather than these phantom concerns that we have with tanks and other issues that may be in the minds of our constituents. But I am sure that my colleagues have made every effort to dispel these unwarranted fears, and have faced up to the issues of this mis- information campaign that has existed. I trust they would do that, Mr. Chair- man; that they would face up to that type of issue and not let that type of misunderstanding and misinformation spread across the land such fear that would result in imprudent types of ac- tions by this Congress. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair- man, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I would like to also recite Mr. Hodel, the past Secretary of the Interior. The last paragraph says, ``This legis- lation Chairman Young is sponsoring, H.R. 883, will bring welcome relief to property owners threatened by aUnited Nations bureaucracy that has grown out of control.'' I support H.R. 883 thoroughly. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. P E- TERSON ). Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I rise to support this legisla- tion. I find it very difficult to under- stand the arguments of those who op- pose it. What is wrong with Congress being in control? What is wrong with the people in our districts, if they agree or dis- agree, having a right to talk to their Congressman? Don Hodel also said, ``During the Reagan administration, these designa- tions were honorary and benign in na- ture. However, like so many United Na- tions programs, this one has fallen sub- ject to inappropriate mission creep. It has become a proxy for international attempts to override national sov- ereignty and control land use.'' Why was America founded by Euro- peans and Asians? Because they wanted additional freedom, they wanted con- trol, they wanted to be in charge, and they certainly do not want people from other countries, and designating is fine, but having other people to have a say about how land is used in our parks, in our public lands, makes no sense in this country. This is about sovereignty. This is about freedom. This is about America being in charge of Americans; having relations with other countries, but they should not have a say in America, and the American public should have Congress to go back to. That is all we are asking, for Congress to be the final word. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 71\u00a42minutes to the gentle- woman from Idaho. (Mrs. CHENOWETH asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. CHENOWETH. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Y OUNG ) for his outstanding leadership on this issue. I have come to the floor many times during my tenure in Congress to dis- cuss this very important issue that H.R. 883 addresses, the constitutional duty that we have as Members of Con- gress to protect the sovereignty of our lands in every possible way. Yet, every time this matter is brought before the House, I hear many of my colleagues vigorously argue that this has nothing to do with our con- stitutional duty to preserve and pro- tect our Nation's sovereignty. I have also heard arguments today from the floor that we should not be meddling in these kinds of things. I know as chairman of the Sub- committee on Forests and Forest Health we even have to have a bill to move a boundary on a wilderness area a half a mile. We have to have a bill to name buildings. So what would the opposition to this bill have us do, just stay busy namingbuildings and moving boundaries, or protect the sovereignty of this Nation? That is our first and foremost responsi- bility. Mr. Chairman, another thing that I have heard from the opposition to this bill is that it does not involve private property. I can tell the Members, it does involve private property when they seized control and took over the New World Mine, a patented mine. That was in fact private property. In fact, the American taxpayer had to pony up $68 million to pay off the Canadian leasehold interests for their loss in the property. The woman who owned the property, who had the pat- ent on the mine, still stands empty- handed. This Congress must deal with that problem, too. Mr. Chairman, this very simple bill enacts three very basic requirements. Number one is it requires the Sec- retary of the Interior to require the ap- proval of Congress for any nomination of property located in the United States for inclusion in the World Herit- age list. Number two, the bill would prohibit Federal officials from nominating any land in the United States as a bio- sphere reserve unless Congress ratifies and enacts the Biosphere Reserve Trea- ty. Finally, H.R. 883 simply prohibits any Federal official from designating any land in the United States for a spe- cial or restricted use under any inter- national agreement unless such des- ignation is specifically approved by law. I might remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that while the World Heritage sites have been or the treaty was approved by the Democrat- led Senate during the Nixon adminis- tration, nevertheless, the biodiversity treaty has never been ratified by the United States Senate, never. Yet, there is enough land that has been set aside under designations of these two des- ignations to fill up the entire State of Colorado. I think it is time we act. We have a responsibility to the American people to protect the sovereignty of our land. Mr. Chairman, these very simple pro- visions do not represent massive changes in policy, nor are they born out of paranoia. There is nothing that says anything about blue helmets or tanks. They are very important items that ensure our Federal officials prop- erly allocate taxpayer resources, and that we as a Congress maintain the total governance of our lands required under Article IV, Section 3, of the United States Congress. This section, very succinctly, states that ``The Congress shall have the power to dispose of and make all need- ful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States.'' It is very clear. It does not take a rocket scientist to interpret what the Constitution says, and neither does it take a court to in- terpret this provision for us to act. WeCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3410 May 20, 1999 do not need the court decisions for the Congress to act in a responsible way. Mr. Chairman, there are some who actually believe that the U.N. Bio- sphere and World Heritage designa- tions, which encompass 68 percent of the land in our national parks, pre- serves, and monuments, and make up an area the size of Colorado, are benign and have the mere purpose of placing a plaque or a label that these areas can use to attract tourism. That is utter naivete. However, in the Committee on Resources we have heard testimony from citizens living in Alaska, Arkansas, Missouri, Min- nesota, New Mexico, New York, and Wyoming that suggest otherwise. These individuals testified about how these designations affected their prop- erty value, their economic activity, and most candidly, their ability to play a role in the designation process. They were left out. Even the U.N.'s own documentation on these programs describes its proactive role on land policy. One such publication defining the purpose of bio- diversity reserves call for extensive land policy initiatives such as ``strate- gies for biodiversity, conservation and sustainable use,'' and for action plans provided for under Article VI of the Convention on Biological Diversity. I am not going to trade our responsi- bility to manage our lands under this constitutional provision for Article VI of the Convention on Biological Diver- sity, and I do not think the American people want us to do that, either. /ballot1215 Mr. Chairman, to me this type of strategy involves a lot more than just a harmless plaque. Nevertheless, the question every Member of this body should be asking themselves today is not whether or not these designations do in fact intrude on our vested power to govern our lands, but whether we should even take that chance. Mr. Chairman, if World Heritage areas or Biodiversity Reserves really are harmless or benign, it should be Congress that makes that determina- tion, not our unelected officials. I do not think that Article IV, section 3 of the Constitution advises that in gov- erning our lands that we simply opt out of policies that may appear ineffec- tual. But instead, it expressly requires that we, the Congress, make all needful rules and regulations. I do not think, Mr. Chairman, the danger can be stated any clearer than it was before the Committee on Re- sources by the Honorable Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, highly respected U.N. Am- bassador during the Reagan adminis- tration, when she stated, and I quote, ``The World Heritage and Man and Bio- sphere committees make decisions af- fecting the land and lives of Ameri- cans. Some of these decisions are made by representatives chosen by govern- ments not based in democratic rep- resentation, certainly not the represen- tation of Americans.''Ms. Kirkpatrick went on to say, ``What recourse does an American voter have when U.N. bureaucrats from Cuba or Iraq or Libya, all of which are parties to this treaty, have made a de- cision that unjustly damages his or her property rights that lie near a national park?'' Mr. Chairman, the only relevant ar- gument that the Clinton administra- tion has made against this bill is that it would add unnecessary bureaucracy to the designation process. I do not be- lieve that is the case. I think that this would simply clarify and straighten out a mess that we have found our- selves in in this administration. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I would point out that clearly the gentlewoman from Idaho (Mrs. C HENOWETH ) is confused about the Biodiversity Treaty, which is not a part of this agreement. We are talking about Man and the Biosphere. I mean, we would obviously stipulate that the Biodiversity Treaty, the Rio Treaty, is something that the Senate has to consider. But apparently we were misplacing our words. I would suggest that the national protection and international protec- tion of cultural and national heritage in Article VI, this particular program points out that, and I will quote from this, ``Whilst fully respecting the sov- ereignty of States of whose territory the cultural and natural heritage men- tioned in Article I and II is situated, and without prejudice to the property right provided by national legislation, the State parties to this Convention recognized that such heritage con- stitutes a World Heritage for those whose protection it is the duty of the international community as a whole to cooperate.'' So the issue that we are dealing here with is not whether the countries are members of this, because we know that there are many nations who are mem- bers of these programs. In fact, with re- gards to the World Heritage Conven- tion, 150 nations are members of that; with regards to Man and the Biosphere, it is 125 Nations; and with regards to the Ramsar Treaty, there are 92 Na- tions. As I had spoken earlier, nearly 2,000 sites, some 1,932 sites that I have and still growing, I suppose, and in the United States, we have some 82 of those sites where less than 5 percent of the sites are located in the United States, and it is based upon the exist- ing land laws that the Committee on Resources, the administration, that U.S. law provides, whether through the national government, through the State governments, the property rights are intact. No one can raise one case where, for instance, the Statue of Liberty has been designated a World Heritage site. What have we lost? What has changed in terms of its administration? Tell me one instance where something has changed that is due to the designationor the recognition that is accorded to these 82 sites, not one witness that ap- peared. The gentlewoman from Idaho (Mrs. CHENOWETH ) raised the question that there was a witness from Minnesota. Well, unfortunately, I am from Min- nesota. We do not have any sites in Minnesota. I would like to have some sites in Minnesota, and I hope someday that we do. But we do not have any in Minnesota. But I guess that witness from Minnesota knew something that I did not. But the fact is, and this is the sort of, I think, misunderstandings that this legislation is based on, not one of these sites has been brought to our attention where there has been any change in the land management that is due to these cooperative voluntary international agreements. While I have tried to portray this as not having a an impact, obviously our park laws, when I wrote and when our committee writes legislation on parks or on wilderness or on BLM or other types of land classifications, I mean what I say when we designate those sites that they ought to be protected, that there are transboundary issues that are affected. I meant what I said. But, unfortunately, I think what is unfolding here is an effort to try, through this American sovereignty claim, through criticism and fear of the U.N., to try to turn around and blame the U.N. and these programs, these international programs. We have everything at stake in terms of pro- viding this type of leadership on a glob- al basis, in terms of trying to encour- age other nations on a voluntary basis, whether it be China, whether they be democratic governments or govern- ments which we think are not demo- cratic, to in fact pursue the preserva- tion, the conservation of their re- sources on a voluntary basis. We have had spectacular success. This is a place, as I said, if it is a criticism of UNESCO in terms of Man and the Biosphere, in terms of re- search, this is an area that is working. This is one area that we should not be debating or disagreeing about in terms of research and gaining information and knowledge. That is the essence of what the Man and the Biosphere pro- gram has. It has nothing to do with the Biodiversity Treaty, as was indicated here, a misstatement I guess on the part of the proponents of this. The same is true of these World Her- itage sites. They deliver tourism. Indi- viduals, just like in a park pass, look at these World Heritage sites, some 506 sites, and they try to go to as many as they can. It encourages tourism in this Nation. We have but 20 of those sites. Obviously our parks are a great attrac- tion and globally known and renowned for the wonderful features that charac- terize them. The Ramsar Treaty obviously is one. There may be other treaties that are affected. These are the three that have stuck out that we have discussed, butCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3411 May 20, 1999 almost any other agreements that we come to on a voluntary international basis are struck down and put back be- fore Congress. I think we know what the disposition of that is. Read the bill. I have read this bill and studied it carefully. It makes an almost insurmountable test in terms of any type of designation of the Man and the Biosphere programs. It goes 10 miles outside the boundary of any of these where there would be a Man and the Biosphere designation and demands that it have absolutely no economic ef- fect. I would suggest that it would almost be impossible to pass the type of test that has been put in here. But I think it has been put in here for good reason; that is, my colleagues want to kill these programs. They want to cut the head off of the Man and the Biosphere program. They want to stop the World Heritage Convention. They want to stop the Ramsar Treaties, which are the basis, really, just the fragile basis of cooperation that we have on an international basis to provide some conservation and leadership. Frankly, in my view, we ought to be doing a lot more on an international basis, dealing with water quality, deal- ing with air quality, dealing with the way that landscapes are treated in terms of how we treat our forests and, indeed, that biodiversity issue treaty that was raised by my colleague. I certainly am a proponent of trying to work on a global basis to protect these resources and to rationally use them and to, in fact, provide for some policy path that would be reasonable with regards to preserving our environ- ment. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote against this measure. It is a bad measure. It is misunderstood and unfortunately a bill the House should not consider at all. I urge defeat of this measure, H.R. 883. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal- ance of our time. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair- man, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I want to clarify the Biosphere Reserve Program is oper- ating without any congressional au- thority at all. Our constitutional sys- tem is designed to make our govern- ment responsible to the people; that is, the American citizens who are the ulti- mate sovereign authority in our sys- tem, a people who must satisfy the concerns of outsiders before they are no longer sovereign. That is why this is called the American Sovereignty Act. I respectfully request my colleagues to vote for this legislation, get us back in control under our Constitution. That is our role. That is our charge. Not to do so is neglecting our responsi- bility. Mr. Chairman, I include the following for the R ECORD :SENATE , STATE OF MINNESOTA , St. Paul, MN, May 11, 1999. Hon. T OMCOBURN , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARCONGRESSMAN COBURN : As Chairman of the Minnesota Senate Committee on Nat- ural Resources and Environment, I commend your efforts to defund the Man and Biosphere Program (MAB). Since one of the major op- ponents of your efforts is Congressman Bruce Vento of Minnesota, who represents a com- pact urban district with little undeveloped land, I would like to tell you about the pain- ful experience northern Minnesota had with the MAB program in the past. During the mid-1980's the National Park Service proposed a massive Northwoods International Biosphere Reserve that in- cluded lands in my Senate district which were included without notifying me or any other local elected officials. In 1984 the state-sponsored Citizen's Committee on Voyageurs National Park took up this issue after a casual comment from the then Voya- geurs National Park Superintendent Russell Berry that our area had been nominated as a biosphere reserve. At a public meeting of that committee on December 1, 1984 in Min- neapolis after the nomination was made, Mr. Berry, partially explained one reason for the biosphere reserve by stating ``I'd like to be in as strong a position as possible to influ- ence activities outside the boundaries that would adversely affect the Park in the con- text of things that would be detrimental to the ecosystem within the Park.'' Because the park is surrounded by thou- sands of acres of private property, Mr. Berry intended to use the biosphere as a means to implement land use controls on private prop- erty. Since my constituents did not want their constitutionally-guaranteed private property rights further threatened, they strongly opposed this proposal. Con- sequently, in 1987 the Northwoods Inter- national Biosphere Reserve nomination was withdrawn by National Park Service Direc- tor William Penn Mott. Until the MAB program is authorized by Congress and statutory protections for pri- vate property are guaranteed, I will support all efforts to defund this program. Without these protections, unelected federal bureau- crats will again use biosphere reserves as a means of implementing federal land use con- trols on private property. Since Mr. Vento's district is 300 miles away from the ill-fated Northwoods Inter- national Biosphere Reserve proposal, I would encourage you to listen to those who rep- resent people who live and work in the af- fected area rather than those who recreate in the area on weekends. Thanks again for your efforts in defense of local control and private property. Sincerely, Senator B OBLESSARD . CHESAPEAKE , VA, May 18, 1999. Congressman R ICHARD POMBO , United States Capitol Building, Washington, DC. DEARMR. POMBO : Thank you for asking for my comments on the process of UNESCO designation of World Heritage Sites. During the Reagan Administration, these designations were honorary and benign in nature. However, like so many United Na- tions programs, this one has fallen subject to inappropriate mission creep. It has become a proxy for international attempts to override national sovereignty and control land use. The current Administration has submitted a thirteen year old press release to invoke my name in support of the World Heritage Site proposals. This is unfortunate political game-playing and deceptive in that it doesnot represent my position. Favorable state- ments made about an honorary and benign program more than a decade ago are pat- ently not applicable to that program as it is now being utilized. The American Land Sovereignty Protec- tion Act, as I understand it, will require con- gressional approval of United Nations World Heritage Site proposals. I believe that this is a necessary and reasonable safeguard for American citizens against overreaching, unelected, unaccountable domestic and international bureaucracies. This legislation Chairman Young is spon- soring, H.R. 883, will bring welcome relief to property owners threatened by a United Na- tions bureaucracy that has grown out of con- trol. Sincerely, DONALD PAULHODEL . STOCKTON , CA, May 13, 1999. Hon. R ICHARD POMBO , Member of Congress, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARCONGRESSMAN POMBO : Thank you for contacting me regarding the House Com- mittee on Resources' March 18 hearing on the American Land Sovereignty Protection Act, H.R. 883. As you know, before President Ronald Reagan appointed me Assistant Secretary for Fish, and Wildlife and Parks, Department of the Interior, I served Governor Ronald Reagan as the Director of California's De- partment of Fish and Game. I am especially proud of the environmental agenda we were able to implement, and the success we had with programs that encourage ranchers, farmers and other private landowners to maintain, develop and enhance wildlife habi- tat on privately owned land. Those benefits continue to this day, and they serve as excel- lent examples of public benefits that flow from private land ownership without govern- ment intervention or funding. Before coming to Washington, D.C. in 1980 to serve President Reagan, I gave 20 years of volunteer service on the board of directors of the National Wildlife Federation (NWF), in- cluding two terms as the Foundation's presi- dent-elect (1976\u00b178). Before my career and commitment to wild- life resources and the environment, I de- fended America's freedoms, including the right to own private property, when serving 41\u00a42years with the U.S. Marine Corps during WWII, and another three years during the Korean Conflict. At the March 18 hearing of the House Com- mittee on Resources, I understand that the U.S. Department of the interior witness en- tered into the official record a 17-year old letter I signed while serving the Reagan Ad- ministration as Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks. I recently reviewed the letter in question, and you should know that it merely dealt with the technical issue of creating a standardized form for recording information on World Heritage Sites. The letter must not be interpreted as anything other than that. The record of the Reagan Administration and the current Clinton Administration re- garding UNESCO's World Heritage, and Man and the Biosphere programs are starkly dif- ferent. Under the Reagan Administration, these designations were indeed voluntary, non-regulatory, and honorary. This is in sharp contrast with the current Administra- tion that invited the World Heritage Com- mittee to Yellowstone National Park to con- demn private property located outside of the Park! The World Heritage Committee delega- tion present was comprised largely of non- elected bureaucrats from Third World coun- tries. Such an action by the World HeritageCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3412 May 20, 1999 Committee clearly runs roughshod over America's sovereignty. H.R. 883 is sorely needed to require Con- gress to oversee non-elected bureaucrats, in both the United States and the United Na- tions, from threatening our nation's sov- ereignty and private property rights of American citizens. Former United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, stated this best in a May 5, 1999, letter she sent to the House Committee on Resources on this issue. she wrote, inter alia: ``In U.N. organizations, there is no account- ability. U.N. bureaucrats are far removed from the American voters. Many of the State Parties in the World Heritage Treaty are not democracies. Some come from countries that do not allow the ownership of private prop- erty. The World Heritage, and Man and Bio- sphere Reserve committees make decisions affecting the land and lives of Americans. Some of these decisions are made by rep- resentatives chosen by governments not based on democratic representation, cer- tainly not the representation of Americans. What recourse does an American voter have when U.N. bureaucrats from Cuba or Iraq or Libya (all of which are parties to this Trea- ty) have made a decision that unjustly dam- ages his or her property rights that lie near a national park? When the World Heritage Committee's meddling has needlessly encum- bered a private United States citizen's land and caused his or her property values to fall, that citizen's appeals to these committees (if that is possible) will fall on deaf ears.'' I strongly support H.R. 883 and urge its passage. I believe H.R. 883 is desperately needed, and I know that it is in the best in- terest of our nation and her citizens to re- quire our elected representatives in the United States Congress to properly oversee the actions of non-elected bureaucrats with- in the United States and the United Nations. Sincerely, G. R AYARNETT , Former Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks. CLARK RANCH , Paso Robles, CA, 14 May 1999. Hon. R ICHARD W. P OMBO , Congress of the United States, House of Rep- resentatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CONGRESSMAN POMBO : I greatly ap- preciate you informing me about the May 12, 1999 letter from Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Interior Stephen Saunders to House Resources Committee Chairman Don Young regarding H.R. 883, the American Land Sov- ereignty Protection Act. The Saunders letter cited a letter I signed 15 years ago as Secretary of the Interior re- garding the U.S.'s continued participation in the World Heritage Convention at a time when our nation decided to withdraw from the United States Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). My letter is characterized by Mr. Saunders as showing ``a strong bipartisan consensus that U.S. involvement with the World Heritage Convention and other international con- servation conventions at issue in H.R. 883 pose absolutely no threat to U.S. sov- ereignty.'' That was true fifteen years ago. It is no longer the case today. When I was Secretary of Interior for Presi- dent Ronald Reagan, World Heritage sites were merely honorary designations. They did not threaten private property rights or na- tional sovereignty. They were designed to recognize outstanding natural and cultural resources in America without creating new layers of regulation on private landowners and rural communities. Unfortunately, this program has been used in some cases by the current administrationto threaten private property owners and na- tional sovereignty. For example, in its ef- forts to stop a proposed mine on private property outside Yellowstone National Park, the current administration in 1995 invited the World Heritage Committee to the park to evaluate alleged environmental threats caused by the proposed mine. This visit by unelected United Nations bureaucrats cre- ated a circus-type atmosphere whereby the World Heritage Committee made the owners of that private property a pariah in the international community. Partially as a re- sult of this visit and a formal declaration later against the proposed mine by the World Heritage committee, the mine was never de- veloped. I also understand that some in the current administration are attempting to use our membership in the World Heritage Com- mittee to help stop a proposed mine in Aus- tralia that is strongly supported by the duly elected government of that country. Such an effort against a sovereign nation would have been unthinkable under the Reagan Adminis- tration which honored the sovereignty of democratically elected governments. My review of H.R. 883 shows it merely pro- vides congressional oversight of the World Heritage Program to prevent an inter- national agency from threatening private property rights and national sovereignty as it did in Yellowstone and is attempting to do in Australia. This legislation will provide the type of adult supervision from elected of- ficials that every domestic and international bureaucracy needs. I appreciate you alerting me that my 15 year old letter is regrettably being used for political purposes in Washington, D.C. Sincerely, WILLIAM P. C LARK . PULP& PAPERWORKERS ' RESOURCE COUNCIL . DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : The Pulp and Pa- perworkers' Resource Council (PPRC) strongly urges you to support H.R. 883, the American Land Sovereignty Protection Act, which soon will be voted on by the full House. This bill provides for Congressional oversight of United Nations Biosphere Re- serves and World Heritage Sites in the United States. The biosphere program is not even authorized by Congress, nor is the pro- gram part of an international treaty. PPRC is a ``Grassroots'' organization rep- resenting more than 300,000 Pulp and Paper Workers and some 900,000 Wood Products In- dustry Workers. Many of our members are unionized workers and we have members in virtually every state of the union. We sup- port natural resource policies that allow our mills to thrive and keep our members and their families employed in well-paying union jobs. PPRC is very concerned how America's sovereignty over its natural resources is in- creasingly threatened by international agreements and unelected bureaucrats at international organizations which often are dominated by Third World nations that have poor records in protecting their own natural resources. This was painfully evident when several PPRC officers participated in the World Commission on Forestry and Sustain- able Development conferences. United Nations Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site designations, adminis- tered by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), are nominated through a secre- tive process that excludes local govern- ments, union workers, private landowners and other average citizens. Only high-rank- ing unelected officials at the State Depart- ment, other federal agencies, UNESCO and national environmental advocacy groups are involved in this nomination process.Our Members, from diverse states such as New York, Arkansas, Kentucky and Min- nesota have fought hard to get a seat at the table when biosphere reserves were proposed in their areas. In all cases, officials from fed- eral agencies ardently worked to keep them out. H.R. 883 would open up this process by requiring that all existing biosphere reserves in the United States be authorized by an Act of Congress by 2002 or they would cease to exist. This would empower average citizens to become involved in these designations. At House Resource Committee hearings in Tannersville, NY, Washington, D.C. and Rolla, MO, PPRC testified in strong support of this legislation. It embodies a basic prin- ciple of open government that citizens and communities have a right to know about de- cisions affecting them before they are made. Again, the Pulp and Paperworkers' Re- source Council strongly supports H.R. 883. Sincerely, DONWESSON , PPRC National Secretary. MAY5, 1999. Hon. Bruce F. Vento, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARMR. VENTO Thank you for your let- ters of March 24th and April 28th regarding my testimony before the House Resources Committee on the March 18th hearing of the American land Sovereignty Protection Act, H.R. 883. In my opinion the important issue here is protection of Americans' rights of democratic process. I sought to emphasize the dangers I see in Congress's waiving of its role and responsibilities over matters which fundamentally affect citizens of the United States and ceding that role and its associ- ated powers to a global organization in which affected Americans have no represen- tation. As I understand it, the proposed Act does nothing more than affirm Congressional role in the management of our public lands, a role mandated to it by the Constitution under Article IV, Section 3, which states: ``The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States.'' I believe that is a clearly worded duty which Congress is bound by the Constitution to uphold. Your letter raises several questions con- cerning my testimony, each of which I have addressed below. I. Please explain the simultaneous decision to continue our active participation in the World Heritage Convention and the U.S. Man and the Biosphere Program [after your sup- port for the successful U.S. withdrawal from UNESCO], both of which are coordinated at the international level by UNESCO. The United States' Permanent Representa- tive to the United Nations oversees U.S. par- ticipation in many United Nations' programs and organizations, including aspects of U.S. participation in UNESCO. The World Herit- age and Man and the Biosphere programs, however, were not among them when I held that job. As you know, the Department of the Inte- rior has primary responsibility for the World Heritage and the Biosphere programs. The Department of the Interior, along with a fed- eral interagency panel controls all aspects of these programs. No member of Congress is included on this panel. Neither was a United States' U.N. Ambassador when I held that position. The Code of Federal Regulations July 21, 1980 public notice of proposed U.S. World Heritage Nominations or 1981 states U.S. law at the time I was our UN Ambas- sador: ``In the United States, the Secretary of the Interior is charged with implementing the provisions of the Convention, including prepa- ration of U.S. nominations. RecommendationsCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3413 May 20, 1999 1``Proposed U.S. World Heritage Nominations for 1981, Public Notice,'' 45 FR 48717, July 21, 1980. You will find the same language in each annual notice.on the proposed nominations are made to the Secretary by an interagency panel including members from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks, the Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service, the National Park Service, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service within the De- partment of the Interior; the President's Council on Environmental Quality; the Advi- sory Council on Historic Preservation, and the Department of State.''1(Emphasis added). I was never included on the panel as the Department of State Representative. I was never invited to participate in any deci- sions concerning these programs. I raised the issue of the U.S. withdrawal from UNESCO to make a point: the UNESCO of the 1980's demonstrates quite well both an example of an incompetent and corrupt international organization and the nearly in- surmountable obstacles of trying to reform it and hold it accountable. During my tenure as U.S. Ambassador, I sought to limit the proliferation and scope of U.N. based on international organizations which were ac- countable to no responsible, democratically elected government. This discussion serves to reinforce the point I was trying to make during my testimony, namely that Congress should take an active role in the oversight of programs which impact private citizens in this country. II. [A]s you know, 7 of the 20 World Herit- age Sites in the United States were listed as such during your tenure as our Ambassador to the U.N. In your capacity as U.N. Ambas- sador, did you oppose these nominations based on the fact that Congress had not spe- cifically authorized these listings? At any point in your tenure, did you attempt to have any existing designations withdrawn on the same basis? I refer you to my answer above. The De- partment of the Interior is charged with im- plementing the provisions of this program, not the United States' UN Representative's office. I had no role and I was not aware of the details of these programs. Now, however, that this issue has ripened, I believe it is time to restore Congress' proper role in this matter. III. ``Your prepared testimony . . . includes the statement, `International Committees\u00d0 whatever the substance of their decisions\u00d0 do not represent the American people and cannot be held accountable by them,' (em- phasis added). Is it accurate to conclude from this statement that you believe specific Congressional authorization should be re- quired for U.S. participation in any program which involves an `international com- mittee?''' Obviously, these committees do not rep- resent the American people. That is not their function. I want to be absolutely clear on this point. Only our representatives on those committees represent Americans. Ob- viously, the Cuban or Libyan delegates to these committees do not represent the Amer- ican people and, in fact, often oppose Amer- ican interests, regardless of the issue. Nei- ther do the New Zealand\u00d0to take a country at random\u00d0or Brazil. The United States' Congress, on the other hand, is elected and does, in fact, represent the American people. U.N. based committees, unlike Congress, are not accountable to the American people be- cause they have not been elected by or cho- sen in any way by the American people. They do not represent and are not concerned with U.S. national interests nor the interests of U.S. citizens. In this democracy, the citizens grant pow- ers to our elected leaders through our votesfrom the local and state levels up to the Con- gress and the Presidency. We give them the power to declare our lands national parks and the right to enact the laws that restrict our use of our properties. We give our duly elected leaders the authority to select the judges who will interpret those laws. Our elected leaders, in turn, respond to our wish- es because, just as we have granted them power, so may we take it from them in the next election. Representation and account- ability are the foundation of the freedoms we cherish. Having fought and won elections yourself, you know this principle well. In U.N. organizations, there is no account- ability. UN bureaucrats are far removed from the American voters. Many of the States Parties in the World Heritage Treaty are not democracies. Some come from coun- tries that do not allow the ownership of pri- vate property. The World Heritage and Man and the Biosphere committees make deci- sions affecting the land and lives of Ameri- cans. Some of these decisions are made by representatives chosen by governments not based on democratic representation, cer- tainly not on the representation of Ameri- cans. What recourse does an American voter have when UN bureaucrats from Cuba or Iraq or Libya (all of which are parties to this Treaty) have made a decision that unjustly damages his or her property rights that lie near a national park? When the World Herit- age committee's meddling has needlessly en- cumbered a private United States citizen's land and caused his or her property values to fall, that citizen's appeals to these commit- tees (if that is even possible) will fall on deaf ears. As for your question ``Is it accurate to con- clude from this statement that you believe specific Congressional authorization should be required for U.S. participation in any pro- gram which involves an `international com- mittee?,' '' my answer is, in any U.N. based committee which makes decisions that im- portantly affect American citizens. Speaking to the issue at hand, which is the require- ment of congressional authorization of World Heritage and Biosphere site designations, I definitely believe congressional authoriza- tion should be required. Congressional role should be protected, I believe, should be re- quired, in any process, any time the Con- stitution specifically places a duty on Con- gress to act. The question presented here is specific. The Constitution mandates congres- sional responsibility over public land man- agement. The World Heritage and Biosphere programs directly impact the management of public and private lands in the United States. Congress should be involved. The Constitution grants and requires Con- gress' broad control over the management of the public lands. The Executive branch, through the Department of the Interior and in conjunction with the World Heritage and Man and the Biosphere programs (the ``inter- national committees'' created by this Con- vention) should not be allowed to exercise Congress' constitutional authority. IV. ``Should Congressional authorization be required for any international agree- ments/contracts which allow use of our na- tional resources and public lands, such as mining or timber harvesting? If it is the case that your support for requiring Congres- sional authorization is limited only to those areas included in H.R. 883, please explain the specific characteristics of `international committees' dealing with conservation which makes them particularly threat- ening?'' First of all, as you know, any U.N. based agreements or contracts which allow use of our natural resources and public lands re- quire various forms of authorization from our elected officials. In this particular case,the authorization must come from Congress. The Convention itself requires that ``the in- clusion of a property in the World Heritage List requires the consent of the State gov- erned.'' [Article II, Section 3] The State in question is the United States and its consent requires the consent of the people through their duly elected representatives in accord- ance with the Constitution. That means Con- gress, the body delegated the authority over land management by the Constitution. The ``American Land Sovereignty Protection Act'' is consistent with both U.S. and inter- national law. In the second part of your question, you ask what are the specific characteristics of ``international committees'' dealing with conservation which makes them particularly threatening?'' My answer is, those commu- nities which affect substantial interests of U.S. citizens. If American citizens have an interest in the conservation of a particular area, that decision should be made by Con- gress, the body delegated responsibility by the Constitution for making these decisions in full view of the American public. And if each decision requires consideration of costs and benefits to the property rights of indi- vidual voters affected, so be it. UNESCO committees are not competent to address the complex private property and public interest issues presented here. They have no interest in how their actions affect private U.S. citi- zens. I believe Congress should not abdicate its responsibilities for land management to international groups whose members have no concern for protecting individual property rights and American interests. Sincerely, JEANE J. K IRKPATRICK . Mr. PACKARD. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support H.R. 883, The American Land Sov- ereignty Protection Act. We must preserve and protect our nation's private property rights for our citizens and for our country. The American Land Sovereignty Protection Act will require Congressional approval before nominating U.S. property as U.N. land des- ignations for inclusion on the World Heritage List. This legislature will also prohibit U.S. property from being nominated as a Biosphere Reserve and it will terminate existing Bio- sphere Reserves if they do not meet the prop- er conditions. Under H.R. 883, Congress will be re-established as the ultimate decision- maker in managing public lands and maintain sovereign control of U.S. soil, not the United Nations. We must pass this legislation and halt designations made without consulting Congress or landowners. Mr. Chairman, the United Nations has iden- tified 92 sites in 31 states and the District of Columbia for acquisition. The fact is, property owners and local governments are routinely shut out of the process and have little re- course if their land is claimed by the U.N. or other international agencies. We must put an end to this uncalled-for seizure of our nation's land and restore control to landowners and local officials. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to sup- port H.R. 883 and continue to protect our na- tion's soil. We must never allow foreign na- tions or international organizations to bully American landowners. Mr. HAYES. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the American Land Sov- ereignty Protection Act. I and 182 of my col- leagues who co-sponsored this bill believe that it is not only common sense, but also Con- gress' Constitutional duty, to protect the sov- ereignty of America's people and her land.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3414 May 20, 1999 As you have heard, UN Land Designations, World Heritage Sites and Biosphere Reserves, take place without the approval of Congress and with little or no Congressional oversight; consequently, the citizens of the United States are excluded from the process. These deci- sions infringe upon State sovereignty, indi- vidual rights of United States citizens, and pri- vate interests in real property. Mr. Chairman, I am proud of the beautiful forests, monuments, national parks and other lovely places in the U.S. as anyone and am thrilled that others outside the U.S. see the beauty in them as well. However, I feel very passionately that if the United Nations decides to designate the Uwharrie Forest\u00d0in the 8th District of North Carolina\u00d0as a World Herit- age Site, that the people of my district should have the opportunity to address how this des- ignation might affect them. Receiving this des- ignation would mean that United States agrees to manage the Uwharrie Forest in ac- cordance with an underlying international agreement which may have implications on private property outside the forest. At best, a World Heritage Site or Biosphere Reserve designation gives the international community an open invitation to interfere in how the Uwharrie, and land surrounding it, are used. The voters of my district might decide it would be in their best interest to accept the UN designation. If that were the case, I would gladly honor the will of my constituents. How- ever, it is their community, their lands and their livelihoods being affected, they have the right, and should have the opportunity, to have a say. The Uwharrie Forest is just one example of a beautiful site in my district. I know each of you can think of several beautiful places in your own districts that would be prime for a UN World Heritage Site designation. I urge you to give your constituents the chance to be involved in decisions that affect them, their private property rights and our sov- ereignty as a nation. I urge you to vote in favor of the Land Sovereignty Protection Act. Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, when I was sworn into office, I took an oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution. Each of us has taken that same oath, and I rise to remind us of our oath of office and reflect on the words of the Constitution. Article IV, section 2 of the U.S. Constitution states, ``The Congress shall have the power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States.'' Clearly, the U.S. Constitution gives the U.S. Congress and only the U.S. Congress the au- thority to make all rules and regulations over Federal lands. This authority is not given to the President, it is not given to the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. No one in the State Depart- ment or the Department of the Interior is given this authority. The Constitution does not give this authority to the United Nations, UNESCO or any other body. The authority to establish rules and regulations over Federal lands is re- served to the U.S. Congress and only the U.S. Congress. What does H.R. 883, this bill, require the Government to follow? The U.S. Constitution. The bill requires the specific approval of Con- gress before any area within the United States is subject to an international land use nomina- tion, classification, or designation. Is this so of- fensive?H.R. 883 requires the consent of Congress before the Secretary of the Interior may nomi- nate any property in the United States for in- clusion in the World Heritage list. I believe this is certainly consistent with Article IV, section 2. H.R. 883 specifically prohibits Federal offi- cials from nominating any land in the United States for designation as a biosphere reserve. Such designations are left to Congress to de- termine. The bill requires the Congress to reconsider for designation as a biosphere reserve those sites that have already been designated as biosphere reserves by previous administra- tions. It restores to Congress the authority to choose to redesignate or not redesignate these sites. This is a process that should have been in place all along. H.R. 883 prohibits Federal officials from designating any land in the United States for a special or restricted use under any inter- national agreement unless such designation is specifically approved by law. I call on all of my colleagues to uphold the U.S. Constitution and the constitutional author- ity of this body. A vote for H.R. 883 is a vote to preserve the authority of this body. A vote against H.R. 883 is a vote that quite frankly, in my opinion, is inconsistent with Article IV, section 2, and the oath that we have taken. ``The Congress shall have the power to dis- pose of and make all needful rules and regula- tions respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States.'' Mr. HILL of Montana. Mr. Chairman, I be- lieve it is critical for the United States to en- sure that our lands are not subject to special international restrictions without careful consid- eration of the implications before a designation is made. The increasing interdependence of the world's economic stability, environmental qual- ity, and peace and human development are often dependent on international cooperation, but this cannot preempt the United States from meeting our obligations to our own citi- zens. This legislation restricts Federal officials from designating lands under the World Herit- age List of the United Nations without the ex- press consent of Congress. Furthermore, it amends the National Historic Preservation Act to restrict United States' lands from being designated as a Biosphere Reserve. It gives Congress the necessary authority to approve all land designations and change any existing designations. These measures are key elements to ensuring that America re- mains in full control of American land. It is critical for the United States to ensure that our lands are not subject to special inter- national restrictions without careful consider- ation of the implications before a designation is made. There is no denying that our world is be- coming increasingly interdependent. Economic stability, environmental quality, and peace and human development are often depending on international cooperation. This interdependence, however, cannot pre- empt the United States from meeting our obli- gations to our own citizens. I cannot support policies that place limita- tions on our ability to manage our own affairs. Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in sup- port of H.R. 883.This bill asserts that Congress under the U.S. Constitution has the power over federal lands. The American Land Sovereignty Protec- tion Act would give Congress the authority to review, not attack, existing Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site designations, in order to decide if such designations are necessary. I find it troubling that initiatives such as the United Nations Biosphere Reserves, World Heritage Sites and Ramsar Sites have been designated with virtually no Congressional su- pervision. Also, I find it disconcerting that all of these designations have had virtually no input from state and local officials. Private property rights are a cornerstone to the American heritage. Our founding Fathers protected the rights of land owners. Many peo- ple in the United States have found that their private property rights are being restricted be- cause they live in proximity to biosphere re- serves. Restrictive regulations that govern these reserves are the brainchild of the United Nations, not the United States government. Land management decisions should be made and reviewed by Congress, not arbi- trarily by bureaucratic officials in the Executive Branch or international agencies. What do my colleagues from the other side fear from Congress doing their job? Why do they fear individuals, local, state and federal entities being involved in the process? Con- gress should not relinquish their duty of main- taining and protecting federal lands. We must ensure the rights of American private property owners at the federal and international level. I urge the passage of this important legislation. Vote yes on H.R. 883. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair- man, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIRMAN. All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5- minute rule for 4 hours and is consid- ered read. The text of H.R. 883 is as follows: H.R. 883 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``American Land Sovereignty Protection Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. (a) F INDINGS .\u00d0Congress finds the fol- lowing: (1) The power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations governing lands belonging to the United States is vest- ed in the Congress under article IV, section 3, of the Constitution. (2) Some Federal land designations made pursuant to international agreements con- cern land use policies and regulations for lands belonging to the United States which under article IV, section 3, of the Constitu- tion can only be implemented through laws enacted by the Congress. (3) Some international land designations, such as those under the United States Bio- sphere Reserve Program and the Man and Biosphere Program of the United Nations Scientific, Educational, and Cultural Organi- zation, operate under independent national committees, such as the United States Na- tional Man and Biosphere Committee, which have no legislative directives or authoriza- tion from the Congress. (4) Actions by the United States in making such designations may affect the use andCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3415 May 20, 1999 value of nearby or intermixed non-Federal lands. (5) The sovereignty of the States is a crit- ical component of our Federal system of gov- ernment and a bulwark against the unwise concentration of power. (6) Private property rights are essential for the protection of freedom. (7) Actions by the United States to des- ignate lands belonging to the United States pursuant to international agreements in some cases conflict with congressional con- stitutional responsibilities and State sov- ereign capabilities. (8) Actions by the President in applying certain international agreements to lands owned by the United States diminishes the authority of the Congress to make rules and regulations respecting these lands. (b) P URPOSE .\u00d0The purposes of this Act are the following: (1) To reaffirm the power of the Congress under article IV, section 3, of the Constitu- tion over international agreements which concern disposal, management, and use of lands belonging to the United States. (2) To protect State powers not reserved to the Federal Government under the Constitu- tion from Federal actions designating lands pursuant to international agreements. (3) To ensure that no United States citizen suffers any diminishment or loss of indi- vidual rights as a result of Federal actions designating lands pursuant to international agreements for purposes of imposing restric- tions on use of those lands. (4) To protect private interests in real property from diminishment as a result of Federal actions designating lands pursuant to international agreements. (5) To provide a process under which the United States may, when desirable, des- ignate lands pursuant to international agree- ments. SEC. 3.

The Clerk will des- ignate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment No. 10 offered by Mr. Y OUNG of Alaska: On page 9, line 13, strike ``2000'' and insert instead ``2003''. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair- man, this amendment is a technical amendment which simply extends the time for grandfathering existing Bio- sphere Reserves by 3 years to 2003. I ask my colleagues for their support. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. I gladly yield to the gentleman from Minnesota. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I have no objection to the amendment. Per- fecting this bill is a very tall task, but the gentleman has made one modest ef- fort to do so. As long as the gentleman continues to yield, I point out that I understand that I will offer just one amendment, as I had indicated to the gentleman. I was not aware that of course the gen- tleman from Colorado (Mr. U DALL ) has an amendment, and I understand the gentleman from New York (Mr. SWEENEY ) has an amendment. I was not aware of those amendments yesterday at the Committee on Rules. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair- man, reclaiming my time, neither was I. So the gentleman is true to his word. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman will yield further, I have no objection to trying to improve this bill. It needs significant improvement. The CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen- tleman from Alaska (Mr. Y OUNG ). The amendment was agreed to. AMENDMENT NO. 9OFFERED BY MR . VENTO Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will des- ignate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment No. 9 offered by Mr. V ENTO : At the end of the bill, add the following new section: ``SEC. 7. INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS CON- CERNING THE DISPOSAL, MANAGE- MENT, AND USE OF LANDS BELONG- ING TO THE UNITED STATES. Title IV of the National Historic Preserva- tion Act Amendments of 1980 (16 U.S.C. 470a\u00b1 1 et seq.) is further amended by adding at the end the following new section: SEC. 405.\u00d0No Federal official may enter into an agreement with any international or foreign entity (including any subsidiary thereof) providing for the disposal, manage- ment, and use of any lands owned by the United States and located within the United States unless such agreement is specifically authorized by law. The President may from time to time submit to the Speaker of theHouse of Representatives and the President of the Senate proposals for legislation au- thorizing such agreements.''. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I guess according the rule we are not going to read the amendment, but this amend- ment is an important amendment that deals with the key component of the pending legislation. This legislation specifically requires to approve the recognition of any U.S. lands for conservation purposes as a re- sult of an agreement with a foreign en- tity. However, at the same time, the legislation does not require similar congressional action when U.S.-owned lands are leased, oftentimes at a loss to American taxpayers, to foreign-owned countries for such things as drilling, mining under the 1872 mining law, tim- ber harvesting, or other types of com- mercial endeavors. My amendment establishes a parity in that process. My amendment would suggest that commercial users and de- velopment of U.S. lands by foreign companies and their U.S. subsidiaries may only be established when specifi- cally authorized by law. My amend- ment would not prevent such activities from occurring. It would simply re- quire Congress to approve such actions. The Vento amendment in which I am joined by the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. R AHALL ) and the gen- tleman from California (Mr. G EORGE MILLER ), the ranking member of the Committee on Resources in this amendment is a responsible provision that responds to the abuses which are now occurring and which neither Con- gress nor the administration can le- gally stop. Many of my colleagues may recall the public outcry when it was revealed that the concession facilities at Yo- semite National Park were going to be managed by a Japanese conglomerate, Matsushita. No legal recourse was available to block that action. A similar outrage was voiced when the Secretary of Interior was required under Federal law to lease lands con- taining more than $10 billion in gold to a subsidiary of a Canadian-owned cor- poration who paid less than $10,000 for that particular $10 billion gold mine. Nothing has been done to prevent a repeat of this type of continued rip-off. A foreign firm can still operate the concession for the Statue of Liberty or any other of our national parks. For- eign firms can continue to exploit American resources while at the same time at the expense of the American taxpayers. We now have an opportunity to change that policy. The Vento amend- ment will not prevent these activities from moving forward, Mr. Chairman, it would simply require the Congress to consider the national consequences and specifically authorize these actions. If we are going to require Congress to approve actions to recognize U.S.- owned lands for conservation purposes of all things to save migrating water- fall, for instance, on a global basis orto recognize our World Heritage sites, some of our outstanding crown jewels, our parks, our natural or cultural areas in the parks, or simply for Congress to approve when we are going to agree with the cooperative research like under the Man and the Biosphere pro- gram, then Congress should also ap- prove actions by foreign firms or indi- viduals to in fact use exploitative ac- tivities on U.S. lands. I understand those activities, the U.S. lands, of course, are going to be used for mining, for timber harvesting, for grazing, water rights, a variety of other things, but the issue is that, if it is going to be done by foreign entities, we hand over the ownership, this has real impact, this particular amend- ment. Unlike this bill which simply re- lies upon the existing laws, the fact is this has real impact in terms of trying to limit these types of activities. So I want to add this particular amendment to this for that reason, Mr. Chairman. Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Chairman, the black helicopters are circling over our lands. And the agents of foreign powers are indeed locking up our public lands, in- tent upon not only controlling them, but ultimately, America's very natural resource heritage. But to be sure, the pilots of these helicopters are not wearing the blue helmets of the United Nations. Rather, they are wearing the cor- porate emblems of companies based in South Africa, Australia, Luxembourg and Canada. These foreign agents are not from the United Nations. Their weapons are not world heritage sites or international biospheres. Indeed, the true threat comes from foreign conglomerates, multi-national mining firms, who swoop down upon our public lands and extract gold and silver with no rents or royalties paid to the American people. The UN Charter, in this instance, is not the issue. It is our very own Mining Law of 1872 which continues, with reckless dis- regard to our economy and our envi- ronment, to turn over federal assets to the control of foreign nationals. And so, I rise in support of the Vento- Rahall-Miller amendment to this bill, the American Land Sovereignty Pro- tection Act. For if we are to protect the sov- ereignty of our American lands from foreign powers, then we must include commercial developments undertaken by foreign powers in the legislation. This is what this amendment is all about. Our lands, our resources, owned by all Americans, are being claimed by foreign entities. The hardrock minerals on these lands are being mined with no return to the public. And these lands are being privatized by foreign entities for a mere pit- tance\u00d0$2.50 an acre.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3417 May 20, 1999 Allowed under the Mining Law of 1872? Yes. Should these practices continue to be condoned in 1999. No. Of course not. So the real issue here today is not what the proponents of H.R. 883 make it out to be. It is not about the UN. It is not about black helicopters descending upon an unsuspecting populace. It is, in these times of budgetary con- straint, about the relinquishment of our lands, and our minerals, to multi- national conglomerates for fast food hamburger prices. Cast a vote for America. Vote yes on Vento-Rahall-Miller. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair- man, I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman, I reluctantly accept the amendment. /ballot1230 The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. BASS). The question is on the amend- ment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. V ENTO ). The question was taken; and the Chairman pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote, and pending that, I make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore.

AMENDMENT NO . 5 OFFERED BY MR . UDALL OF COLORADO Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Chair- man, I offer an amendment. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment No. 5 offered by Mr. U DALL of Colorado: Page 9, line 6, after ``in the United States'' insert ``(other than an area within the State of Colorado)'' Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Chair- man, this is a very simple amendment. It would exempt all the Biosphere Re- serves in Colorado from the provisions of the bill that would end the partici- pation of U.S. sites in the Man and the Biosphere program unless we pass and the President signs a new law to con- tinue their participation. As I noted in general debate, cur- rently there are two of these reserves in Colorado, the Niwot Ridge Research Area and Rocky Mountain National Park. They include lands within the Second Congressional District which I represent. Mr. Chairman, these areas are not in- volved in some conspiracy. They are not part of any sinister foreign plot to undermine our Constitution or our way of life. On the contrary, they are places where good things are taking place. In the Niwot Ridge area, scientists associated with the University of Colo-rado are doing important research about air pollution and other environ- mental issues in cooperation with sci- entists from other countries, such as the Czech Republic. This is important work, work that needs to continue; and my amendment would allow that to happen without interruption. As for Rocky Mountain National Park, all I can say is that this is one of Colorado's brightest gems, one of the things that makes us proud to be Colo- radans. Rising up from the edge of the Great Plains, it straddles the Conti- nental Divide and includes snow-capped peaks, high-altitude tundra, and a di- verse array of other land forms and a splendid diversity of vegetation and wildlife. As Coloradans, we are glad to share its beauty with the Nation and we in- vite the world to experience it. And the world is doing just that, at least in part, because of its designation as a Biosphere Reserve. The National Park Service tells me that many visitors say that they learned of the park because it was included in the Man and the Bio- sphere program and that is what made them want to visit it. As one who believes there is a benefit to every visitor to special wildlands like Rocky Mountain National Park, I am convinced that that is reason enough to keep the park in this pro- gram. But it is also true that tourism is a very important part of Colorado's economy, and that is another reason to keep the park in the program, which my amendment would do. Let me be clear, Mr. Chairman. Adop- tion of my amendment will not make this a good bill. Even if this amend- ment is adopted, that alone will not be sufficient for me to be able to support the bill. But this amendment will pro- tect Colorado from some of the worst consequences of the bill, and to that extent I think it is very, very impor- tant. Accordingly, I urge adoption of the Udall amendment. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair- man, I rise in opposition to the amend- ment. These Biosphere Reserves were des- ignated without congressional author- ization and without consulting the public or State and local governments. This amendment invades the responsi- bility, again, of the Congress under Ar- ticle IV, section 3 of the Constitution, making all laws concerning disposal or regulation of lands belonging to the United States with Congress. Under H.R. 883, existing Biosphere Reserves would have until December 31, 2003, to get authorization. They are not automatically disenfranchised. If the Colorado Biosphere Reserve had the strong local support claimed by the gentleman that offered the amend- ment, then there would be no problem of getting the passage of this legisla- tion in this Congress. If I am still chairman of that com- mittee, I will commit to the gentleman that I will support it if his people wantto have it in that district. If they do not, it would not occur. Mr. TANCREDO. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose the amendment of my good friend and col- league from Colorado (Mr. U DALL ). The sites that he identifies that presently exist in Colorado, the Niwot Ridge Re- serve and specifically also the Rocky Mountain National Park, are being des- ignated sites under the Heritage Act. Specifically, the Rocky Mountain National Park, of course, has been around for a long time and has been the protected environmental jewel in the crown of Colorado for a long, long time. It is peculiar, to say the least, that some other kind of designation, some United Nations designation, would help continue or would help pre- serve the environmental uniqueness of this particular property, or anything else in the State of Colorado, for that matter. My colleague talks about the many tourists that flock to the State to see these places, especially Rocky Moun- tain Park. He is certainly correct in that; and, of course, they come in droves. In fact, one of our problems in Colorado is that oftentimes we have far too many people trying to get into these particular areas and preserves, into Rocky Mountain National Park; and our problem is trying to deal with the numbers coming in and the impact that that has on the Rocky Mountain Park and on many things that we are trying to protect. When I was in the committee, Mr. Chairman, and we were debating this bill, it was a very interesting situation that occurred, in that in the State of Wyoming there was an attempt on the part of some people in the State of Wy- oming to develop some mining adja- cent to Yellowstone National Park, and all the processes were underway. The environmental impact statements had been ordered and were underway. We had spent years actually in the process of identifying the problems and trying to come to a solution as to whether or not it was appropriate to let this mine go forward. All of a sud- den, within I think it was a short pe- riod of time, a week or less, that we were going to actually get the final go- ahead on this project in Wyoming, the head of the Park Service stepped in and called upon the United Nations to come out to this particular area and give it a designation that would, in fact, pro- hibit any future development. And when that happened, the administra- tion intervened and everything stopped. Now, this is the kind of thing I am concerned about in the State of Colo- rado, and this is why I certainly oppose the amendment of the gentleman that would exempt Colorado from the pro- tection provided by this particular bill. We need this protection just as much as any other State in the Nation be- cause the same thing could happen in Colorado.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3418 May 20, 1999 We think we know about how to pre- serve and protect the land that we have under our control in the State of Colo- rado and with the Department of Parks and Recreation. We do not need the United Nations to tell us how to man- age that land. We do not need the im- primatur of the United Nations on Rocky Mountain Park in order to en- courage tourism to Colorado. We can do it without them. In fact, oftentimes, as in the case I just stated, this United Nations des- ignation becomes much more problem- atic from the standpoint of the proper regulation of the land within any State, in this case Colorado. So I certainly rise to oppose the amendment of the gentleman from the Second Congressional District. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment. Mr. Chairman, at the risk of getting involved in this Colorado feud, obvi- ously this does not improve the bill enough, but I think it is a modest step, and I want to support the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. U DALL ) whenever I get a chance, Mr. Chairman. The fact is that most of the land des- ignations, I would suggest to my col- league from Colorado, whether it is Park Service Organic Act or the Frasier Experimental Station or the others, inherent in them, in these des- ignations of wilderness, is the concept of doing scientific research. I mean, that is what the Organic Act has, that is what the Wilderness Act of 1964 has in it. That is one of the purposes. And so, insofar as the Man and the Biosphere program that my colleague was alluding to, and I guess I saw four sites that were affected by that. My colleague said there were two. The gen- tleman had earlier said there were six. I found four. So there are some sites in Colorado that may not be well under- stood where they are. But one is the Frasier Experimental Station, as my colleague probably has noticed. An- other was the Rocky Mountain Na- tional Park, a wonderful area. Now, I suppose the problem of get- ting people in and out, that that was such a big problem, I think that is a good problem in terms of Rocky Moun- tain. And I hope we can solve some of the transportation problems that exist around those parks, but I would not suggest that to solve that we take away the designation of the park, and I am sure my colleagues from Colorado would not suggest that, either. In any case, that was the purpose. The purpose of this is, and just as a way of using this amendment to point out, that most of the laws that are ap- plicable that are engaged in the agree- ments we have are already in place. We already passed judgment on these issues. We did it once. Now, some of my colleagues may want to do it again. Some may have objections. Obviously, we continue to hear about the Ozarks issue, a large area that was proposed as a biosphere. But in that case, whatever system was in place, however cumbersome it was,it worked. They did not designate that particular site. With regards to Yellowstone, I think it is important to recognize, and the gentleman from Colorado, our friend and colleague, brought up the issue of Yellowstone again, as did our colleague from Wyoming (Mrs. C UBIN), that in fact it was designated a World Heritage Site long throughout the process of the mine evaluation, EIS. What happened is that the committee decided that if that mine was going to go in, it became a Heritage Site at risk, endangered type of site. And of course the committee can make that declaration. It had absolutely no effect on the decision that was made, other than it might have persuaded the Park Service or others to pay a little closer attention. I mean, we cannot take away free speech in this process. We cannot take away free thought in terms of what is going to happen. We cannot do that with legislation here. In fact, we as a Nation enshrine the concept of free de- bate and free thought with regard to these issues. And it is as if this legisla- tion is trying to reach out and prevent somebody from making a judgment about the U.S. and how we manage our lands. We cannot do that. For instance, if somebody is misman- aging lands in other areas, we obvi- ously are going to speak about it, whether it is Amazonia and/or other parts of the world, other rain forests. So we are going to speak out about it. Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Chair- man, will the gentleman yield? Mr. VENTO. I yield to the gentleman from Colorado. Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Chair- man, I thank the gentleman from Min- nesota for yielding. I just wanted to make a couple other comments in response to the points that my colleague from Colorado made, as well as my colleague from Min- nesota. It seems, as I hear this debate today, all roads lead to the New World Mine. We keep coming back to that par- ticular situation. And I think there is a continued debate about what hap- pened there, and we ought to continue to figure out ways in the long run to mitigate those kind of situations when we have a big mining project on the edge of a national park that is so im- portant to us, the Yellowstone Na- tional Park. But I am offering my amendment in the spirit of let us not let that conflict and that situation affect what is going on in Colorado. There are important re- search projects occurring at Niwot Ridge and occurring in Rocky Moun- tain National Park. I do not see what the problem is that we are fixing in Colorado. In fact, I think we are cre- ating a problem by doing this. So I urge adoption of my amendment. Let us not hurt Colorado and some of the other States that are involved in these projects, this important Man and the Biosphere project, because of what happened in one case in Yellowstone National Park./ballot1245 The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. BASS). The time of the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. V ENTO ) has expired. (By unanimous consent, Mr. V ENTO was allowed to proceed for 1 additional minute.) Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I of course rose in support of the amend- ment. But I use this as an indication of what is generally wrong with the en- tire thought process and what is going on with this particular legislation. I do not think it is repairable by this amendment or others that might be of- fered. It is a flawed bill. These discus- sions and debates ought to be going on in subcommittee rather than the sort of exaggerated statements that we had. Unfortunately, they did not. So we are on the floor. I would think that there would be more important business that could and should be considered by this Congress on this floor. Mr. Chairman, I support this amend- ment. Mr. SWEENEY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words, and I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. T ANCREDO ). Mr. TANCREDO. Mr. Chairman, I just would conclude with a comment, a quote actually from Jeane Kirkpatrick that I think encompasses everything we have tried to establish here on our side about our concerns with regard to this amendment in particular and to the concerns of our opponents to this bill in general: If American citizens have an interest in the conservation of a particular area, that decision should be made by Congress, the body designated responsibility by the Con- stitution for making these decisions in full view of the American public. And if each de- cision requires consideration of costs and benefit to the property rights of individual voters affected, so be it. UNESCO commit- tees are not competent to address the com- plex private property and public interest issues presented here. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. SWEENEY. I yield to the gen- tleman from Minnesota. Mr. VENTO. I appreciate the quotes from the former U.N. representative Jeane Kirkpatrick. Seven World Herit- age sites were designated while she was in that role. So apparently, as with Mr. Hodel, he has now since then, being strongly in support of them in the 1980s when they were in control or in power, now have found reason to oppose these sites. But I think actions speak louder than words. I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. UDALL ). The question was taken; and the Chairman pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Chair- man, I demand a recorded vote, and pending that, I make the point of order that a quorum is not present.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3419 May 20, 1999 The CHAIRMAN pro tempore.

AMENDMENT NO . 4 OFFERED BY MR . SWEENEY Mr. SWEENEY. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment No. 4 offered by Mr. S WEENEY : Page 9, line 16, after ``management plan'' insert the following: ``that specifically en- sures that the designation does not affect State or local government revenue, includ- ing revenue for public education programs, and''. (Mr. SWEENEY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. SWEENEY. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Y OUNG ) for affording me the opportunity at rather a late mo- ment to introduce my amendment. My good friend the gentleman from Colo- rado (Mr. U DALL ) just said that all roads in this bill and this debate and this discussion seem to lead to the New World Mine. The reason I am happy I am able to introduce my amendment is because I think it will serve a number of purposes. But one point that can de- finitively be made is that that is not true, that all roads are not leading in this matter to the New World Mine, that it has impact on the individuals, of people throughout this Nation and in particular in my district. We have heard eloquent debate on both sides of the issue, speakers who have spoken of the need for greater local input and greater input from indi- viduals, and those who have said or who have perceived that these issues involve just the use of public lands. That is not true at all. My amendment expands the existing provisions of H.R. 883 by requiring the Secretary of Inte- rior as part of the management plan to also ensure that the biosphere designa- tion does not affect the revenue of State and local governments, including and probably most importantly the revenue for public education programs. Mr. Chairman, as we have heard, the manner in which international land use agreements have been carried out can tend at times to infringe on the au- thority of our local municipalities and individuals. My amendment would help protect State and local governments from experiencing a decrease in real property values. As those in many struggling local townships and coun- ties in upstate New York which I rep- resent know all too well, depressed property values serve to depress prop- erty tax revenues, the major source for education funding in this country. Today, there are 47 U.N. Biosphere Re- serves and 20 World Heritage Sites and there is not an argument on this side of the aisle that there is not some legit-imacy and need for these agreements. But many of these international agree- ments were established without local input and certainly without congres- sional input or approval. This is not government of the people, for the peo- ple, by the people, it is detached inter- nationalism in the eyes of many. Most U.N. designations, including the ones in my district, encompass privately held lands, not just public lands. Most of all, there have been instances where no communication with local of- ficials and community residents took place about the effects of designating these lands. These are the people that it affects the most. These are the peo- ple in most instances who have rightful ownership of the property that is being affected, who define their freedom in fact by virtue of that ability to own these lands. The current process of se- lecting U.N. Biosphere Reserves with no recourse for those local residents and their elected officials affected must end. In the 22nd Congressional District of New York, which I represent, there is now one of the largest U.S. Biosphere Reserves housed in the Adirondack Mountains. The private landowners and townships in the Adirondacks had no idea that the Adirondack Park Agency, a quasi-State agency, quietly approved the U.N. biosphere designation and residents were helpless to impact on that, to stop it, to comment on it. In fact, that designated area encompasses 7 million acres of privately held land. It encompasses territories outside the purview and jurisdiction of the Adiron- dack Park Agency. Yet it has become part of that designated area. Let me tell my colleagues from expe- rience, the U.N. biosphere is an un- wanted cloud now that hangs over a good part of the Adirondack region. My congressional district is one with the greatest interest in seeing that this practice is reined in, that the input and the voice of the local individual be heard. It is unfair that my constituents are not included in any discussions that directly affect them and that I as their representative in Congress have practically no avenue to express their concerns. The Secretary of Interior must be re- quired to make the case of U.N. des- ignation to State and local govern- ments as well as this Congress and our Federal bureaucracies should be held accountable to this Congress for any of the effects that international agree- ments will cause. It is imperative that we protect the rights of our private property owners and the legitimate in- terests of local governments and their citizens. This bill accomplishes those objectives and my amendment I believe strengthens it by elevating the inter- ests of State and local governments and the effects of U.N. designations on their ability to collect revenue. It is important to the private property own- ers, it is important to the citizens of those regions, it is important to public education in those areas.Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and support this important bill. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to take this op- portunity to speak today in support of this im- portant legislation, H.R. 883\u00d0the American Land Sovereignty Protection Act. My district in upstate New York has one of the largest U.N. Biosphere Reserves in the United States, thus I have a direct interest in H.R. 883 and strongly support its passage. H.R. 883 clearly addresses the concerns many of us have had with the U.N. Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Sites programs. As we know, the U.N. Biosphere Reserve program has been operating with essentially no public or congressional oversight for the past 25 years. And without such oversight often, no one is accountable. These designations can have a marked im- pact on the properties in and around the bio- sphere region, yet, in most cases, neither local government nor property owners are ever con- sulted regarding the designation or site con- sideration. As an example, in my congressional district, the Champlain-Adirondack Biosphere Reserve was created in 1989 at the request of a quasi- governmental agency\u00d0the Adirondack Park Agency. This was done without hearings or formal input from local citizens of the Adirondacks; thus the residents were left feeling helpless and in the reality had no impact upon it. The result was a very bitter feeling and rightfully so over an unwanted imposition on private land- owners. Given negative effect on property values, and compounded by the cavalier attitudes of those handing down designations and the bla- tant disregard for local authority, I would sub- mit that with congressional oversight and pub- lic input, many of these U.N. sites would not have been approved in their current form. The American Land Sovereignty Protection Act unequivocally states that no land in this country can be included in international land use programs without the clear and direct ap- proval of Congress. H.R. 883 is a first step in the right direction in returning power to the local citizens as well as the elected Representatives in Congress. Most importantly, this bill reasserts the con- stitutional rights of property owners to make property decisions, within local zoning author- ity, without interference from the United Na- tions whose mandate does not necessarily in- clude concern for our town halls, school houses, or individual property owners in any given area. What recourse do affected landowners have against the United Nations bureaucracy? Absolutely none. This bill changes that. I urge your support. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from New York spoke of 7,000 acres of land that apparently falls under a biosphere, some other impact. Mr. SWEENEY. If the gentleman will yield, seven million acres. Mr. VENTO. Seven million acres. Mr. SWEENEY. In the Adirondack region of New York State that are pri- vately owned. Mr. VENTO. I appreciate that and am happy to yield to the gentleman brief- ly.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3420 May 20, 1999 Did the gentleman have any instance where there was some problem that arose out of that designation with re- gards to private property owners? Mr. SWEENEY. There have been a number of instances where private property owners in the use of their property, in the valuation of their property and their ability to develop and cultivate that property have been infringed upon based upon the designa- tion. I think the gentleman misses the point, that the most predominant frus- tration that those constituents of mine have\u00d0\u00d0 Mr. VENTO. Just reclaiming my time for a minute, we have been through this with others that have claimed that but we have yet to sub- stantiate any of those types of claims. So if the gentleman could help substan- tiate that, I think it would go a long way towards solving a problem. Be- cause right now the way the bill stands, I think it is purporting to solve problems, in my judgment, that do not exist. On the amendment that the gen- tleman has, he suggests to insert after ``management plan'' on line 16, and it is amendment No. 4, I believe; is that correct? Mr. SWEENEY. The gentleman is correct. Mr. VENTO. The gentleman says that after ``management plan,'' he wants to put in language that specifically en- sures, and I am quoting from the gen- tleman's amendment, ``that specifi- cally ensures that the designation does not affect State or local government revenue, including revenue for public education programs, and.'' What if the revenue increases? What if it decreases? According to this amendment, you would have to dem- onstrate that you would have a static situation, that there would be no in- crease and no decrease in revenue. That is the effect of the gentleman's amendment. Is the gentleman aware of the effect of his amendment? Mr. SWEENEY. If the gentleman will yield further, that is not the effect at all. I think the effect is one that is a basic premise of citizenship, and that is the right of citizens to know the im- pact that their government or any other entity might have on their par- ticular property. Mr. VENTO. Reclaiming my time, it is not just a question of knowing this. It is this is one of the requirements. It says that ``any designation under this law, the Man and Biosphere Program, shall not have, and shall not be given, any force or effect,'' and then you are putting down, ``that specifically en- sures that the designation does not af- fect State or local government rev- enue, including revenue for public edu- cation programs.'' So it can have no effect, no effect going up, no effect going down. That is what it says. That would completely vitiate the ability to, and this is al- most an impossible test in this bill in any case. So I might say, I do not know, this is sort of what I would call piling on infootball. I would have long ago blown the whistle. This is what the amend- ment has. I understand that the gen- tleman may not have had that inten- tion. But we are not going on the basis of intention. We are going on what is written in the law. Mr. SWEENEY. If the gentleman will yield further, this is not an issue of remedies, it is an issue of notice. I think it is fundamental in the proposal that any U.N. Biosphere area be des- ignated, that this Congress and the in- dividuals and the constituents in that area affected have the right to know of the effect of that designation. My amendment simply calls for the providing of that notice. It says noth- ing to the effect of imposing any sanc- tion or remedy. Mr. VENTO. Reclaiming my time, if the gentleman will look at his amend- ment again. It says that specifically ensures, the plan has to ensure that the designation does not affect State or local government revenue, including revenue for public. So it does not affect it. What does he mean by does not af- fect it? He means it goes up or down, does he not? What happens to revenue? Mr. SWEENEY. If the gentleman will yield, it requires the Secretary of Inte- rior to report back to Congress of the cost effects, the property tax in par- ticular, effects on any of those affected individual properties. Mr. VENTO. What if the values go up as a result of this designation? Mr. SWEENEY. That should cer- tainly be part of the debate that we have at that time on any of those des- ignations. Mr. VENTO. It would be invalidated based on that. I just think it is an inartfully drawn amendment. As I said, I think the amendment just represents piling on. For that reason, I do not in- tend to support it. I think it is not well drawn, and I wanted to point out the effect of that. I think the test here in this bill would make it nearly impos- sible to have this voluntary scientific cooperation in the process. I do not know the purpose of this. This amend- ment obviously is not drawn well. But unfortunately under the rule that the gentleman perhaps voted for, I did not, we had to preprint everything in the RECORD ahead of time and we are all limited in time here. You do not really have the right to perfect your amend- ment or correct these types of prob- lems, another little issue the gen- tleman ought to take up with the Com- mittee on Rules under a so-called open rule. AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR . YOUNG OF ALAS - KA TO AMENDMENT NO . 4 OFFERED BY MR . SWEENEY Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair- man, I offer an amendment to the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. Young of Alas- ka to amendment No. 4 offered by Mr. Sweeney: Insert ``adversely'' before ``affect''. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order against the amend- ment.The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. A point of order is reserved. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair- man, it is my intent to offer this amendment, which I have just done, I do think it is germane, to try to im- prove the amendment of Mr. S WEENEY , which I do believe his amendment is clear, but the gentleman from Min- nesota has raised a question. I want to make sure that this now is perfectly clear, for adverse effect only. /ballot1300 Mr. Chairman, I urge support of the amendment. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I with- draw my point of order. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. BASS). The question is on the amend- ment offered by the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Y OUNG ) to the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. S WEENEY ). The amendment to the amendment was agreed to. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. SWEENEY ), as amended. The question was taken; and the Chairman pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair- man, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Pursu- ant to House Resolution 180, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. SWEENEY ), as amended, will be post- poned. Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this legislation and in support of the Vento and the Udall amendments that have been offered and against the Sweeney amendment that has been of- fered in the committee today. First and foremost, let me say that I think this is a very unfortunate piece of legislation. It plays into some con- spiracy theories that somehow, when we receive the honor of the designation of World Heritage area or the Bio- sphere Reserve Program or were part of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, that somehow this is land use planning by the United Nations. Nothing could be further from the truth. Mr. Chairman, there is nothing in these designations that changes any Federal, State, local laws or regula- tions pertaining to these lands or changes the manner in which private property owners can use their lands, but what it does do is it provides an honor for some of the great natural as- sets of the United States and some of the great historical assets of the United States that leads to increased tourism, improved economics, and rec- ognition of what this Nation has done in setting aside some of the great na- tional parks and public spaces in the entire world, and I think we ought to welcome that kind of designation.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3421 May 20, 1999 I also want to say that it is very clear when we consider the Vento amendment that much more harm has been done to public lands and done to private lands because of the acquisition of these lands by foreign entities that then come in here and take the re- sources from those lands, whether it is mining or whether it is timber or graz- ing or other proposals like this, where then we end up spending hundreds of millions if not billions of taxpayers' dollars cleaning up after these entities, making up for erosion, making up for the destruction and the deterioration of those natural assets. That is why I think that the Vento amendment is very, very important for its adoption today because we should not just have a willy-nilly process where people come in, buy these assets, exploit the resource and then leave it to the American citizens to pick up the cost of their bad policies, their bad management and mistakes in the use of those lands and those resources. So I would hope that Members would vote against this bill on passage, and I would hope that they would support the Udall and the Vento amendments, and I want to thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. V ENTO ) very much for his managing this bill on the floor today, and his involvement in this issue over the last several years in try- ing to put this argument into perspec- tive and show how foolish it is and how much it is based upon fallacy and mis- representation of facts. Also, I think he said something in the Committee on Rules the other day that is very important, that success with this legislation is really about the first step in removing the designations from our great wilderness areas, from our parks areas, from our national monuments, because the same people who support this legislation in fact op- pose the designation and the protection and the acquisition of these great lands for the use of the people of the United States, for all of the people of the United States. As much as those people support it, we have a small group of people in the Congress and in this country who insist that somehow these lands really do not belong in the public domain in spite of the fact that mil- lions of Americans will pick up their families, their children, and they will travel across this country to visit the Statue of Liberty, to visit Liberty Hall, to visit the Grand Tetons, the Grand Canyon, Bryce, Yosemite and so many other great monuments and great natural assets in the national park systems of this country. There is still a few in this Congress who want to believe that we should roll back designations. This legislation is the first step in that process, and this Congress ought to reject that effort. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I yield to the gentleman from Min- nesota. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I appre- ciate the gentleman's support in thisbattle, and I think we are winning it and we should win it. Mr. Chairman, the problem in our country is not with the designation and the parks that are embraced by our people. They are, in fact, among the most popular and the most strongly supported by the public. The parks really represent what is right with our country. It is one of the best ideas we have ever had. And it is not, Mr. Chair- man, I might say, the scientists that are doing research on natural resources that are at risk. These are not the problems in terms of our public lands and in our communities, in terms of scientific research that is being done in these parks or in these areas. That is not a problem, but this bill purports to solve that problem. It solves the prob- lem of the designation of our parks, recognition of our parks. It tries to solve the problem of scientific re- search, to strip away the ability to do collaborative research. That is what the essence of these treaties and agree- ments exist. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The time of the gentleman from California (Mr. G EORGE MILLER ) has expired. (On request of Mr. V ENTO , and by unanimous consent, Mr. G EORGE MIL- LER of California was allowed to pro- ceed for 2 additional minutes.) Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I yield to the gentleman from Min- nesota. Mr. VENTO. So it is not the sci- entists that are doing research that are the problem, and in fact we can on a global basis cooperate and encourage other nations to work with them and do the type of scientific research that is necessary. We can study all we want within the United States, but we have got 1,900 other sites around the world that this permits us to study in, and other sites that it permits us to recog- nize as natural or cultural. So this is an assault on parks. It is an assault on research. That is really what it purports. The problems here are the mines, they are the clear cuts, they are the destruction of rain forests, the burning of rain forests. They are the uncontrolled types of mining that goes on in other nations. That is where the problems exist largely, and we ought to be coming to grips with those: the drift nets in the oceans, the de- struction of the biosphere. Unfortunately, Mr. Chairman, the first efforts, the first timid efforts of this Nation and of this global commu- nity to try to deal even with the rec- ognition of parks in a honorific way and the research of scientists, this bill attacks. I think it is a misunderstood bill, I think it is a bad bill, I think it is bad policy, and I hope the Congress will reject this, the House will reject this, today. Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman, and let me just say, as my colleagues know, it is with great pride that theAmerican people point to their na- tional park system, it is with great pride that the American people know that the Statue of Liberty stands in New York Harbor and sends a beacon to the world about the tenets and the val- ues of this Nation, and it is a great pride that those assets, the Grand Can- yon, the Everglades, the Statue of Lib- erty and others, when the rest of the world honors, honors the decision that people in this country made about set- ting aside those public lands for public use, and it is a great honor that the millions of Americans choose to visit those parks each year to enjoy them, to participate in them, to learn from them. But it is also a task of this Con- gress and of the world community to make sure that we learn more about those parks that we are able to main- tain. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The time of the gentleman from California (Mr. G EORGE MILLER ) has expired. (By unanimous consent, Mr. G EORGE MILLER of California was allowed to proceed for 2 additional minutes.) Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, we are able to maintain and protect those parks, and this Con- gress has a rather checkered past on that. But if we put it to the American people, they would vote to spend bil- lions of dollars to maintain and protect the great parks of this Nation. It is an honor to this Nation that people come from all over the world to visit these parks, that nations come to us and send their representatives here to learn how to do the same thing in Asia and Africa and Europe, all over. All over the world people want to emu- late what Theodore Roosevelt started and what we have protected on a bipar- tisan basis. Now we have a group of people who decided that they are going to roll that back, they are going to take away that designation, they are going to remove this honor from the American people. The pride of this Nation, the beacon we send to the rest of the world; they now have decided that they want to remove this honor and start that process of denigrating these most valuable and cherished public lands in our Nation. The pride of our Nation as we send out messages to the world about conserva- tion, about the protection of public lands, about the values of this country. This legislation is absolutely looney, it is absolutely looney. It is based in some unknown conspiracy, unsubstan- tiated, based upon the fact that some people believe that day in and day out they see black helicopters swooping in to protect the national parks of the United States. No, Mr. Chairman, that is not how it is done in this country, it will never be done that way in this country, and this legislation should not try to validate those kinds of crazy conspiracy theo- ries. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Are there further amendments to the bill? Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair- man, I move to strike the last word.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3422 May 20, 1999 Mr. Chairman, I have just heard one of the greatest presentations of looney tunes I have ever heard. Very frankly, this is nothing to do with the parks. We do not invade the parks, we do not invade any of the other areas. We are trying to reestablish the congressional activity in designating land and not letting the U.N. I have to remind people the U.N. or- ganizations are not accountable. U.N. bureaucrats are far removed from the American voters, and remember, many of the U.N. delegates that make these decisions do not believe in privately- held property. Their countries are owned by dictators or owned by gov- ernments that do not have private property, and when they make deci- sions, the United States, under our Constitution affecting private property rights, that is wrong. All my bill does is have the Congress get back involved in the designation of lands. If they are so heavily supported, those outside the parks, then I suggest respectfully they will be easily passed in this Congress. It does not affect any of the parks or any of the reference here or any of the Heritage Sites such as the Statue of Liberty. My bill does not affect that. All we do is put the committee, this Congress, back into the process of designating the lands. UNESCO, Paris, France, March 6, 1995. Hon. G EORGE T. F RAMPTON , Jr., Assistant Secretary for Fish & Wildlife & Parks, U.S. Department of the Interior, Office of the Secretary, Washington, DC, USA. DEARMR. FRAMPTON : I am writing to you with respect to a letter from a group of North American conservation organizations, addressed to Dr. Adul Wichiencharoen, Chairman of the World Heritage Committee, and dated 28 February, 1995. The World Herit- age Committee is the executive body of the Convention and is elected by its 140 States Parties. I note that a copy of this letter was sent to your office. The letter concerns the possible listing of Yellowstone National Park on the List of World Heritage in Dan- ger. The World Heritage Committee had been made aware of some of these concerns in a brief report by the United States Delegate to the July 1993 meeting of the World Heritage Bureau. The fourteen organizations signing this letter are as you know among the most pres- tigious and influential in the field of natural resources conservation. We believe that the concerns they raise about the threats to Yel- lowstone must be carefully examined and ad- dressed. Included with their letter was a briefing book containing copies of correspondence from the Governor of Wyoming and Senator Baucus of Montana, each raises serious ques- tions about the potential damage to Yellow- stone National Park, in particular from the proposed mining operation. Similar letters of concern are provided from professional ge- ologists, geomorphologists and hydrologists who have investigated the proposed mining operation. This correspondence is sufficient to raise considerable concern about the long- term sustainability of the World Heritage values of this World Heritage site. From the report it appears that while a draft Environmental Impact Statement has been prepared, it did not resolve several major questions and many issues remainunder review. Thus it would appear pre- mature to reach any conclusions at this time. With respect to the List of World Heritage in Danger, there are no specific criteria. The Committee has the authority to place a site on the List of World Heritage in Danger when it is of the view that the World Herit- age values for which the site was inscribed are seriously threatened. The procedure for listing normally in- volves a monitoring report by the World Conservation Union (IUCN), in consultation with the State Party and the management authority responsible for the site. IUCN re- ports to the Bureau of the World Heritage Committee which meets in July and the Bu- reau makes a recommendation to the Com- mittee, which usually meets in December of each year. While we have taken note that the con- servative organizations have requested that the World Heritage Secretariat involve itself in the EIS process, we simply are not staffed to do so. We would, however, be pleased to address these organizations on any aspects of the operation of the World Heritage Conven- tion. We could also request IUCN as our technical advisors, to review the Environ- mental Impact Statement. We are confident that as the State Party responsible for the implementation of the Convention the essen- tial professional skills are available to you. It is important to note that Article 1 of the World Heritage Convention obliges the State Party to protect, conserve, present and transmit to future generations World Herit- age sites for which they are responsible. This obligation extends beyond the boundary of the site and Article 5 (A) recommends that State Parties integrate the protection of sites into comprehensive planning pro- grammes. Thus, if proposed developments will damage the integrity of Yellowstone Na- tional Park, the State Party has a responsi- bility to act beyond the National Park boundary. Examples of the need to act beyond park boundaries are found at the Everglades Na- tional Park, Glacier National Park and Gla- cier Bay National Park, all World Heritage sites. In two of the sites the Government of British Columbia acted to close major min- ing operations rather than risk possible dam- age to downstream World Heritage values in both Canada and the United States. Clearly if there are threats to World Herit- age values the State Party has a responsi- bility to act. If enabling legislation is not adequate, new legislation should be consid- ered, as was the case in Australia with re- spect to the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage site. The World Heritage Committee has the au- thority to act unilaterally in placing a site on the List of World Heritage in Danger. However, in the past the Committee has demonstrated a clear desire to work in con- sort with the State Party. In this respect we would appreciate receiving a comprehensive report on the situation in time for the meet- ing of the World Heritage Bureau to be held in Paris in early July. Such a report would enable the Committee to give serious consid- eration to the listing of Yellowstone Na- tional Park on the List of World Heritage in Danger, should such a decision be warranted, at its nineteenth session to be held in De- cember 1995. The United States has an exemplary record in support of and in accordance with the principles and requirements of the World Heritage Convention. We look forward to continuing this cooperation. Yours sincerely, BERND VON DROSTE , Director, World Heritage Centre.LEGISLATIVE RESOLVE NO. 13 Be it resolved by the Legislature of the State of Alaska: Whereas the United Nations has designated 67 sites in the United States as ``World Herit- age Sites'' or ``Biosphere Reserves,'' which altogether are about equal in size to the State of Colorado, the eighth largest state; and Whereas art. IV, sec. 3, United States Con- stitution, provides that the United States Congress shall make all needed regulations governing lands belonging to the United States; and Whereas many of the United Nations' des- ignations include private property inholdings and contemplate ``buffer zones'' of adjacent land; and Whereas some international land designa- tions such as those under the United States Biosphere Reserve Program and the Man and Biosphere Program of the United Nations Scientific, Educational, and Culture Organi- zation operate under independent national committees such as the United States Na- tional Man and Biosphere Committee that have no legislative directives or authoriza- tion from the Congress; and Whereas these international designations as presently handled are an open invitation to the international community to interfere in domestic economies and land use deci- sions; and Whereas local citizens and public officials concerned about job creation and resource based economies usually have no say in the designation of land near their homes for in- clusion in an international land use pro- gram; and Whereas former Assistant Secretary of the Interior George T. Frampton, Jr., and the President used the fact that Yellowstone Na- tional Park had been designated as a ``World Heritage Site'' as justification for inter- vening in the environmental impact state- ment process and blocking possible develop- ment of an underground mine on private land in Montana outside of the park; and Whereas a recent designation of a portion of Kamchatka as a ``World Heritage Site'' was followed immediately by efforts from en- vironmental groups to block investment in- surance for development projects on Kamchatka that are supported by the local communities; and Whereas environmental groups and the na- tional Park Service have been working to es- tablish an International Park, a World Herit- age Site, and a Marine Biosphere Reserve covering parts of western Akaska, eastern Russia, and the Bering Sea; and Whereas as occurred in Montana, such des- ignations could be used to block develop- ment projects on state and private land in western Alaska; and Whereas foreign companies and countries could use such international designations in western Alaska to block economic develop- ment that they perceive as competition; and Whereas animal rights activists could use such international designations to generate pressure to harass or block harvesting of ma- rine mammals by Alaska Natives; and Whereas such international designations could be used to harass or block any com- mercial activity, including pipelines, rail- roads, and power transmission lines; and Whereas the President and the executive branch of the United States have, by Execu- tive Order and other agreements, imple- mented these designations without approval by the Congress; and Whereas the United States Department of Interior, in cooperation with the Federal Interagency Panel for World Heritage, has identified the Aleutian Island Unit of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge,CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3423 May 20, 1999 Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Cape Krusenstern National Monument, Denali Na- tional Park, Gates of the Arctic National Park, and Katmai National Park as likely to meet the criteria for future nomination as World Heritage Sites; and Whereas the Alaska State Legislature ob- jects to the nomination or designation of any World Heritage Sites or Biosphere Re- serves in Alaska without the specific consent of the Alaska State Legislature; and Whereas actions by the President in apply- ing international agreements to lands owned by the United States may circumvent the Congress; and Whereas Congressman Don Young intro- duced House Resolution No. 901 in the 105th Congress entitled the ``American Land Sov- ereignty Protection Act of 1997'' that re- quired the explicit approval of the Congress prior to restricting any use of United States land under international agreements; and Whereas Congressman Don Young has re- introduced this legislation in the 106th Con- gress as House Resolution No. 883, which is entitled the ``American Land Sovereignty Protection Act''; Be it resolved that the Alaska State Legis- lature supports House Resolution 883, the ``American Land Sovereignty Protection Act,'' that reaffirms the constitutional au- thority of the Congress as the elected rep- resentatives of the people over the federally owned land of the United States and urges the swift introduction and passage of such act by the 106th Congress; and be it Further resolved that the Alaska State Legislature objects to the nomination or des- ignation of any sites in Alaska as World Her- itage Sites or Biosphere Reserves without the prior consent of the Alaska State Legis- lature.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to inform the House of the plans of the Committee on Rules in regard to H.R. 1401, the National Defense Authoriza- tion Act for fiscal year 2000 and the Fiscal Year 2000 Legislative Branch Ap- propriations bill. Today the gentleman from California (Chairman D REIER ) informed the House of the Committee on Rules' plan re- garding these bills in two ``Dear Col- league'' letters. The Committee on Rules will be meeting the week of May 24 to grant a rule which may restrict the offering of amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000. The bill was ordered reported by the Committee on Armed Services on May 19. A copy of the bill and report will be available for review in the office of the Committee on Armed Services on Mon- day, May 24. The bill is also expected to be available for review on the Com- mittee on Armed Services' web site this evening. Any Member contemplating an amendment to the bill should submit 55 copies of the amendment and a brief explanation to the Committee on Rules in H\u00b1312 of the Capitol no later than Tuesday, May 25 at 5 p.m. Amendments should be drafted to the text of the bill as ordered reported by the Committee on Armed Services. The Committee on Rules is also plan- ning to meet the week of May 24 to grant a rule which may limit the amendment process for floor consider- ation for Fiscal Year 2000 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act. The Committee on Appropriations or- dered the bill reported Thursday, May 20, and is expected to file its com- mittee report on Thursday, May 25, 1999. Any Member wishing to offer an amendment should submit 55 copies and a brief explanation of the amend- ment to the Committee on Rules in room H\u00b1312 of the Capitol no later than 12 p.m. on Tuesday, May 25. Amend- ments should be drafted to the bill as reported by the Committee on Appro- priations. Copies of the bill may be ob- tained from the Committee on Appro- priations in room H\u00b1218 of the Capitol.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3426 May 20, 1999 Members should use the Office of Legislative Counsel to ensure that their amendments are properly drafted and should check with the Office of the Parliamentarian to be certain that their amendments comply with the rules of the House. /fdash DECLARATION OF POLICY OF UNITED STATES CONCERNING NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE DEPLOYMENT Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, by di- rection of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 179 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as fol- lows: H. R ES. 179 Resolved, That upon adoption of this reso- lution it shall be in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 4) to declare it to be the policy of the United States to de- ploy a national missile defense, with a Sen- ate amendment thereto, and to consider in the House a motion offered by the chairman of the Committee on Armed Services or his designee to concur in the Senate amend- ment. The Senate amendment and the mo- tion shall be considered as read. The motion shall be debatable for one hour equally di- vided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Armed Services. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the motion to final adoption without intervening mo- tion. Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the cus- tomary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. F ROST ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may con- sume. During consideration of this res- olution, all time yielded is for the pur- pose of debate only. Yesterday, the Committee on Rules met and granted a rule providing for the consideration of H.R. 4, Declara- tion of Policy of the United States Concerning National Missile Defense Deployment with a Senate amendment. The rule is twofold. First, it makes in order a motion to concur in the Sen- ate amendment in the House. Second, the rule provides 1 hour of debate on the motion equally divided and con- trolled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Armed Services. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4 is a straight- forward bill, declaring that it is the policy of the United States to deploy a national missile defense system as soon as it is technologically possible and to seek continued negotiated reductions in Russian nuclear forces. Mr. Speaker, in 1957, during a speech here in Washington, D.C., General Omar Bradley warned that we are now speeding inexorably towards a day when even the ingenuity of our sci- entists may be unable to save us from the consequences of a single rash act or a lone reckless hand upon the switch of an uninterceptible missile. Forty-two years later, General Brad- ley is still right, not because we may be unable to stop an incoming missile, but because we cannot.Not long ago, this House approved the national missile defense program by a margin of 317 to 105, a ratio of bet- ter than three to one. I am urging my colleagues to demonstrate their over- whelming support for this rule and its underlying bill once again. Besides thousands of nuclear war- heads on ballistic missiles maintained by Russia, China has more than a dozen long-range ballistic missiles targeted at the United States, and countries like North Korea and Iran are devel- oping ballistic missile technology and capability much more rapidly than once believed. The argument that rogue nations need more than a decade to obtain bal- listic missile capability is both tech- nically irresponsible and politically naive. The threat is real. The threat is here. The threat is now. Even worse, most Americans do not realize that we have absolutely no de- fense, none at all, against a missile at- tack. We have been lulled into a false sense of security, unaware that nations across the globe are currently devel- oping ballistic missiles which pose an immediate threat to our security. In fact, just last year, Iran launched a medium-range ballistic missile with the help of North Korea and Russia. We can protect ourselves from mis- siles of these potentially hostile na- tions. Deployment of a national mis- sion defense system would cost less than our last six military peacekeeping missions. Let us pass this rule and pass this declaration of policy and protect our Nation and its people from the threat of a missile attack. I would like to commend the Com- mittee on Armed Services, the gen- tleman from South Carolina (Mr. SPENCE ), and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. W ELDON ), chairman of the Subcommittee on Military Re- search and Development, for their hard work on this very important measure. I urge my colleagues to support this rule and to support the underlying leg- islation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my- self such time as I may consume. (Mr. FROST asked and was given per- mission to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, while I support the Senate amendments to H.R. 4, I rise in opposition to the rule. I oppose the rule because of the process or the lack thereof. The Democratic members of the House Committee on Armed Services were totally bypassed on this bill; and that, Mr. Speaker, is reason enough to oppose the rule. The process is really incomprehensible, Mr. Speaker, since the Senate amendment to the House- passed version of the bill states very simply that it is the policy of the United States to deploy as soon as is technologically possible an effective national defense missile system thatwill protect the territory of the United States from missile attack. That simple statement of policy is the distillation of what has been acri- monious public debate for over 15 years. What has changed, Mr. Speaker? I think most of the Members of this body can agree that what this bill calls for is not the Reagan Star Wars of the 1980s. Indeed, the Senate amendment wisely adds language that subjects any missile defense system to the annual appropriations process which, in this era of fiscal restraint, places real con- straints on any proposed missile de- fense system. In addition, H.R. 4 does not mandate one system over another, nor does it mandate a date for deployment. In its simplicity, this bill acknowledges that the United States might well find itself subject to an attack that we should be prepared to defend against, but that we should do so within the context of the technological and financial realities of 1999. Mr. Speaker, few of us in this body can deny that the world has become, since the end of the Cold War, an even more dangerous place than we might have imagined. There are rogue nations and factions that seek to harm, if not destroy, the United States. This bill is an attempt to move for- ward the debate on the issue of the na- tional missile defense without the acri- mony that has accompanied the discus- sions on this subject in the past. H.R. 4 provides us with a good start, and I am hopeful that it will help us move to a resolution to a thorny, but incredibly important, issue. Mr. Speaker, this rule will allow 1 hour of debate on the Senate amend- ments, a time limit that might have, given the importance of this matter, been extended to allow all Members who are interested in this matter an opportunity to speak. In spite of the fact that the House has conducted very little business in the past few weeks, the Republican ma- jority continually fails to give matters of great importance adequate time to be fully aired on the floor. I would hope that when we return from the Memo- rial Day recess, one that has now been extended through an entire week, the Republican leadership will consider a schedule that gives important legisla- tion more time to be debated by the elected Members of this body. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Penn- sylvania (Mr. W ELDON ), who is the House leading expert on missile de- fense. (Mr. WELDON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WELDON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and in support of the underlying Sen- ate amendments, but I am not happy with the legislation. I am not happy because, when we brought this bill up in the House, weCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3427 May 20, 1999 had a clear and distinct debate. As the original author of H.R. 4, I made the point known to every Member of this body that this would be a vote for the President's policy or against the Presi- dent's policy. If my colleagues are supportive of holding this decision off for a year so it could be made during the middle of a Presidential election, then they should have opposed the House bill. And 102 brave Democrats and two brave Repub- licans did that. They opposed the bill. But I said, if in spite of the Presi- dent's letter of opposition on the morn- ing of the vote, if my colleagues were for moving forward now to make that decision, then they should vote for the bill. And 214 Republicans did, joined by 103 Democrats, for a veto-proof margin. It was a clear and distinct point of op- position against this administration's policy. No mistake about it. Then we saw the White House and Bob Bell try to suspend what we had just done, try to tell us that it really did not mean what we said it was. In fact, the Senate on the floor of debates agreed to two amendments. These amendments mean nothing. They mean nothing. They are simply cover for lib- eral Democrats who do not support missile defense to have a way to cover their you know whats. One of them says that any missile de- fense program should be subject to the authorization and appropriation proc- ess. Well, duh. Everything we do in this Congress is subject to the authoriza- tion and appropriation process. Are we so naive as to think that somehow we pull manna from heaven and we bring dollars to the table and that is what funds programs? That amendment means nothing. It has no bearing on this bill or what we are doing here. The second amendment says that we should continue to negotiate reduc- tions in arms. Who disagrees with that? The irony is that the Senate put an amendment on that only refers to reductions in Russian arms. What hap- pens, Mr. Speaker, if the Russians re- gard this as only being an attempt to get them to reduce their arms while the U.S. is not paralleling that proc- ess? The amendments unfortunately passed, and we could do nothing about that. The Senate having the rules, they had forced us to take a bill that I am not happy with. But it does move the process forward, and I would say to my colleagues, in the full debate, we will have a colloquy that will be joined by the chairman of the full committee that will be joined by the majority leader and the Speaker who will clarify on the R ECORD what this bill means by this body. /ballot1415 If the White House chooses to run for Congress, than they can interpret our bills. If Bob Bell chooses to step down and run for a House seat, he can change or he can then interpret our bills. But, short of that, nobody can interpret ourlegislation except for us. We are the ones who drafted the bill. We are the ones who passed the bill. We are the ones who passed the clean bill of this House, only to be amended by extra- neous and irrelevant amendments on the Senate side. I will be asking my colleagues today to vote ``yes.'' But clearly, during our debate and discussion we will clarify the record time and again to show that there is a clear and distinct difference between the position of this adminis- tration and the position that 317 Mem- bers of Congress supported. I am outraged that right after we passed this bill President Clinton would send me a letter that says this: ``Next year we will determine whether or not to deploy for the first time a limited national missile defense against these threats.'' That is the let- ter. That is not what this bill says. It does not say, Mr. President, next year. It says today we will pass this con- ference report, we will move forward, and we will do it in direct contradic- tion to what this administration is try- ing to spin. And when the White House has its signing ceremony, I do not know whether I will be invited or not, but if I am, I will clearly make the case that it is a clear policy difference between this White House and their attempt to spin what we did that they could not defeat in this body. We could have overridden the veto because we had 103 Democrats agree with this, along with 214 Republicans, and this was at a time when the White House issued a state- ment in opposition to our bill. These amendments mean nothing. All of us agree that an authorization and appropriation processes must be followed. All of us want to see reduc- tions in arms by both Russia and America. Unfortunately, the Senate amendment only says Russia, which could be read as destabilizing. The point is, the crux and the actual content of this bill is simple. Today we are saying in the Congress of the United States that it is time to deploy a national missile defense capability. Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Wash- ington (Mr. D ICKS). Mr. DICKS. Mr. Speaker, I want my good friend and colleague from Penn- sylvania to know that I was one of the Democrats who voted for his resolu- tion. But I must say, we held a hearing in the defense appropriations sub- committee, now called the Sub- committee on National Security Ap- propriations, this year. Lieutenant General Lester Lyles came over and briefed our committee. And, frankly, we are not doing very well in devel- oping this technology. We have got se- rious problems. I personally believe that if we look at missile defense, that the number one priority when we deploy our troops is to have a capable theater missile de- fense system. We need to focus on thatfirst. And of course, as the gentleman from Pennsylvania well knows, we have had five failures of the THAAD system, which is fundamental to hav- ing a credible theater missile defense system. We have the Patriot 3, the PAC\u00b13 program, which is doing quite well. Now, if we cannot do theater missile defense, no matter how loudly we yell, we are not going to command a na- tional missile defense system into being. Now, General Lyles has testified before our subcommittee that it is going to be at least 2005 before we have done the testing that is necessary to have any confidence that we would have a credible limited system. So I think the language in this reso- lution that says let us be honest with ourselves, we cannot be in denial here, that we are going to do this, I voted to do it when it is technologically fea- sible. If the science is not there, if the engineering is not there, if the tech- nology is not there, we cannot just wish it into existence. And so I hope that my colleagues will think about this issue. This is one of the most important national security issues that we face. None of us likes the idea of being vulnerable to any country's potential for using a ballistic missile. But think about it. We had the whole era of the Cold War when the Russians had thousands of warheads aimed at the United States and we had thousands of warheads aimed at them. What did that produce? That produced deterrence. We knew that if either one of us struck the other that we would open up the possibility for a cata- strophic war that would destroy both countries, and so we were deterred. And today the United States has more offensive capability than any other country in the world and more credible and more capable offensive ca- pability. And I believe that any coun- try that thought about launching an attack against the United States would have to be out of their mind, because they would know that we would know where the missile launched from and we could have the potential to respond with overwhelming force. I think deter- rence still is a valid doctrine that we should not forget about as we work to- wards getting a national missile de- fense system in place. So I think the language of the Senate improves and makes more credible this resolution that we previously voted on. And I think my view is that I want this technology to work. One of the companies from my State is in charge of trying to integrate this and make it work. But we cannot tell the American people that there is something out there that will work until we can demonstrate it, and we have not been able to demonstrate THAAD. We have not been able to dem- onstrate a comprehensive theater mis- sile defense system. And so I think we ought to be very sober about any of these exhortations that we are hearing about from peopleCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3428 May 20, 1999 here who want to wish this into exist- ence. Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Penn- sylvania (Mr. W ELDON ). Mr. WELDON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, let us focus the debate on the facts. Mr. Speaker, my good friend and col- league just spoke and made some points. First of all, he said the THAAD program has had five failures. What he did not properly explain is that of the five failures that occurred, none of them, none of them involved hit-to- kill. The five failures that occurred were caused by quality control prob- lems of the Lockheed Martin con- tractor, and we in the Congress took the lead to force them to begin to pay for those failures. We have never had a test yet to actu- ally get to hit-to-kill, but in fact the THAAD program has accomplished 28 of 30 milestones. That is a tremendous success. So to characterize the THAAD program as a failure does a terrible dis- service to those people who are work- ing on that program because the facts do not bear that. Second, the gentleman made the point that this is a terrible technology challenge. Well, it is. And he pointed out that a company in his area, Boeing, is a lead system integrator. What the gentleman did not mention is that the head of this program, Dr. Peller, in congressional testimony said the chal- lenge to build the Space Station was more difficult than to build a national missile defense. Now, that is the top of- ficial of the company that comes from the district of the gentleman. The third is deterrence, that we somehow can rely on the deterrence of the 1980s. That may have been true. I do not want to trust North Korea not to fire that Taepo-Dong 1 at one of our cities. And I would say to my good friend and colleague, 28 young Ameri- cans, half of them from my State, came back from Desert Storm in body bags because we could not defend against a low-complexity missile that wiped them out. I agree with the gentleman, theater missile defense is our top priority; and I use my votes and my voice to help ac- complish that. But we cannot ignore the threat to our country by saying North Korea will avoid attacking us because of deterrence. And finally, this is what offends me. I will make a prediction on the floor today. The reason why the White House is spinning this the way they are is because next year, in the middle of the presidential campaign, Vice Presi- dent Gore will announce that we are going to deploy NMD. That is an abso- lute travesty and an outrage for this country. Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11\u00a44 minutes to the gentleman from Wash- ington (Mr. D ICKS). Mr. DICKS. Mr. Speaker, again, I just want to say to my colleagues, we want a national missile defense systemagainst a limited attack. I think that is a wise thing to do. I am just saying to everyone here today, after having General Lyles come before our committee and after going through each of the technologies in place, I have to report to my colleagues that General Lyles says 2005 is the ear- liest we would have a capability, and that capability has not yet been dem- onstrated. We have not been able to do what it takes to put it in place. It does not exist. And we cannot just create something out of whole cloth. Now, let us make it work. Let us be sober. Let us be realistic and honest with the House and the American peo- ple. Let us wait and do this when it is technologically feasible. We cannot do it, anyway. I mean, we cannot wish this into existence. So I urge every- body, including my colleague from the State of Washington, to be sober. I can remember when these people came in from my own State and they told and told me in 1983 that this tech- nology was in hand. Edward Teller came and told us that the technology was in hand. It is now 1999, we have spent billions, and it is not in hand. This is a hard problem. Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, I re- serve the balance of my time. Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Mis- souri (Mr. S KELTON ), ranking member of the Committee on Armed Services. Mr. SKELETON. Mr. Speaker, let me take this opportunity to speak on the rule. I am compelled to do so because I speak today about the process, about the process that brings us to the floor. Mr. Speaker, I speak not as a Democrat but as a Member of this House and as a member of the Committee on Armed Services. Just over 2 months ago, the House and the Senate passed H.R. 4 and S. 257, respectively, similar legislation, de- claring it the policy of the United States to deploy a national missile de- fense. But since then, Mr. Speaker, the process has been hijacked. There was no conference committee between the House and the Senate. As a result, differences in the two meas- ures have not been reconciled as nor- mally they are reconciled. Rather, we are being asked to concur in the exclu- sive work of the Senate on a take-it-or- leave-it basis. That is not right. Implied in this fact is the notion that the Senate has a patent on all the knowledge and all the insight on this particular matter. And, of course, I re- ject that because we in this body, in our committee, have been very, very active on this issue. And, therefore, I am disappointed that the views of the House Members, both Democrats and Republicans, have not been afforded regular order consid- eration in the matter that is before us today. I think the process that brings us here today is not only unfortunate but it is unnecessary. Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 41\u00a42 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. D OGGETT ).Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, how ap- propriate the timing of this debate. As we speak, folks are lined up around the block across America to see the new Star Wars movie. And what better time than right now, with the refrain of that great Star Wars theme music, the opening day of ``The Phantom Men- ace,'' for us to be taking up this pro- posal. Just like the original movie, this bill puts a tractor beam in the Capitol dome and aims it right at the wallets of the American taxpayer to support this defective system. This Star Wars scheme is a technological failure. It has failed one test after another, again and again. An accelerated program to test it has been described as ``a rush to failure'' by former Air Force Chief of Staff General Larry Welsh. I am reminded of Han Solo's admoni- tion to Luke Skywalker: ``Jumping through hyperspace ain't like dusting crops, boy.'' Well, hitting a bullet with a bullet, hitting in fact many bullets, with bullets raining down over the en- tire continental United States at 15,000 miles an hour, and doing it accurately and reliably, is not like dusting crops, either. And yet here we are, year after year, having demands to throw more good money after bad. I disagree with my colleague from Washington State about this measure, but he is right about one thing. Wish- ing is not going to make it so. The first law of Disney Wish and make it so, does not apply here; rather it is the laws of physics and thermodynamics that control weather this can be ac- complished. /ballot1430 Just 3 days ago, we acted in this Con- gress on spare parts and training and readiness. As Joint Chiefs Chairman Hugh Skelton said recently, the mas- sive amount of experiments on these kind of Star Wars programs drain re- sources from personnel and readiness accounts. If there is a readiness prob- lem, it is a problem that this Repub- lican Congress created in preferring pork over readiness. We are diverting these kind of precious resources away from our true military and nonmilitary needs because we have people here who keep coming up year after year asking us to throw an infinite amount of tax- payer money at a problem that has real physical limitations. I agree fully with my colleague from Texas, Mr. F ROST , about the substance of this resolution, about the important meaning of the Senate amendments. But the effect I disagree with him on, because it is clear that the Star Wars advocates are using this measure to boost their cause. The missile defense that is being advocated, even if it worked, would not defend us from the real threats we face from terrorism, with bombings at the World Trade Cen- ter, with gas attacks like that that oc- curred in a Japanese subway. If we really want to do something to address our security, the CongressCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3429 May 20, 1999 ought simply to read the National Re- search Council of the National Acad- emy of Science report this week about the threat, the very real threat that we have from the potential or diversion of Russian nuclear materials. Our Energy Department had to spend $600,000 in emergency funds last year because guards at some of these facilities in Russia had no winter uniforms for out- side patrols and left without paychecks searching for food. That is a real secu- rity threat that should concern every one of us. We are not doing very much about it. Implementing the START II nuclear missile reduction treaty would elimi- nate 3,000 Russian nuclear warheads, in fact, that this fantasy proposes to deal with in outer space. Such implementa- tion would do a great deal more to as- sure the security and safety of Amer- ican families than this proposal. We should be giving that our highest na- tional security priority. Instead of di- verting attention from this vital objec- tive, this Congress should be encour- aging a START III to have further re- duction in nuclear armaments around the world and truly protect our free- dom. What so many in this House fail to recognize is that national security is measured in terms other than simply how many bombs, bullets and missiles we possess. It is measured in economic strength, in productivity and in the success of our efforts to reduce threats from abroad. I urge the House to con- sider defense programs that meet our true security needs and reject this pro- posal. Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. S PRATT ). Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, I believe in ballistic missile defense if it is fea- sible, but we have yet to prove that it is feasible. I was the principal cospon- sor of H.R. 4 because I thought we needed a focus to our ballistic missile defense program. I thought we needed to make a decision that we would go forward with the objective of fielding a system, a system that worked and would afford us at least limited protec- tion against an accidental strike in this country. But I was honest to ac- knowledge on the House floor that we are not there yet. We have not proven the capability of this system. However, having spent $50 billion over the last 15 years, I thought it was time to bring those efforts to fruition, to build a workable system if we can as opposed to putting more viewgraphs on the shelf. H.R. 4 was an effort to reach some kind of bipartisan consensus on a very basic proposition, that the focus of our efforts in ballistic missile defense would be to deploy a system. We passed that bill here with a hefty margin. We sent it to the other body, they struck everything in it, adopted a completely different bill and now they send it back to us in a process that is a breach of procedure, bypassing the proceduresthat are long established and that are intended to achieve a consensus be- tween both Houses. Normally when we pass a bill and send it to the Senate and they pass a different bill, there is a conference to hammer out the dif- ferences, a conference to establish a record as to why the compromises in language were made to the extent that these are made. There is no record here. We have had no conference. We are bypassing the traditional proce- dure. For what reason I do not know. This is no way to legislate. It is also no way to build bipartisan consensus on something that has been sort of a polit- ical totem. As I have said before, we do not de- bate ballistic missile defense the way we debated the MX or the B\u00b12 or other major systems. This system is so charged with political significance that it is a totally different kind of debate. One of the things we will not have as a result of this procedure is a record, a record to explain the legislative his- tory of what some truly ambiguous and unclear language in this particular bill actually means. This bill calls for billions of dollars to be spent to deploy a national missile defense system, quote, as soon as it is technologically feasible, or possible. What does this mean? I am concerned that it could mean that as soon as we have got the technology or think we have it in hand, we are supposed to rush to deployment, even though we might end up with a suboptimal or a substandard system. I am concerned that it may mean before we have ade- quately tested, we will move to deploy- ment. That is not an idle concern. Yesterday in the defense authoriza- tion bill markup, an amendment was added which allowed the director of this program and the Secretary of De- fense to begin deployment before this system was fully tested, a dispensation that is granted to very few defense pro- grams. It could mean that we will de- ploy even though it is extravagantly expensive, far more expensive than the protection it would allow us. It could mean any number of different things. We do not know. There is no legislative history. We have not been able in the House to have the opportunity to give meaning to that particular phrase. The bill specifies that this national missile system must be capable of af- fording us a limited defense, or defense against a limited ballistic missile at- tack. What does ``limited'' mean? Is it an unauthorized attack, an accidental attack, or an attack by, say, one sub- marine which could mean easily more than 100 warheads? Very, very critical to have that definition pinned down. In our bill, we had legislative his- tory. We said it was an accidental at- tack. We limited the scope of the effec- tiveness of the system. Here they talk about a limited attack. That could range from 5 warheads to 200 warheads. It is not clear at all. We have no oppor- tunity to make it clear. Furthermore, the timing of this bill, the timing of the previous bill, dis-turbed me. I know it disturbed the gen- tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. WELDON ), too. Because this bill is misperceived by the Russians. I said that on the floor, I said it in com- mittee. The Russians see this bill as somehow a potential or anticipatory breach of the ABM treaty. I think that is unfounded. I think what we are trying to move towards is a system where we can rely upon our defenses so that we do not have to rely so much upon the threat of a retaliatory strike. I think that would be an improvement in deterrence and an improvement in the stability in the world. The Russians do not see it that way yet. They see us moving away from the ABM treaty. This language in this bill is not bound to give them com- fort and encouragement, because this bill says that in addition to deploying defenses in this country, we should also seek to negotiate reductions in Russian nuclear weapons. I agree that we should be negotiating with the Rus- sians. We should have done START II. We should have pressed them to ratify it long before now. But they perceive START II as being tilted against them. Now we are saying in this bill, ``We're going to build defenses and we want you to build down your missile systems,'' which suggests that we want complete superiority here. It is not the formulation for a successful bargain. It is not the kind of message we need to send the Russians, particularly at a time when we are leaning on them and Chernomyrdin is today in Belgrade try- ing to cut a deal with us. It is just ill- timed. I will probably vote for this bill because I believe in ballistic missile de- fense and I do not want to muddle that message on my part but I am very, very disappointed in the process and procedure it is taking. Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. It is important that we take a look at reminding ourselves as we debate this rule that the national missile de- fense program, the vote most recently held in this House, was 317\u00b1105, better than a 3 to 1 ratio of the Members of this great body in support of a national missile defense program. Number two, on some of the questions with the rule, I would remind all of my colleagues that at the Committee on Rules yester- day, it was a voice vote on the rule ap- proval that we have before us today. Finally, Mr. Speaker, I must go back to my opening remarks, that most Americans do not realize that we have absolutely no defense, none at all, against a missile attack. We have been lulled into a false sense of security, un- aware that nations across the globe are currently developing ballistic missiles which pose an immediate threat to our security. Mr. Speaker, today is the day to act. I urge passage of this rule. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3430 May 20, 1999 The previous question was ordered. The resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. Mr. SPENCE. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 179, I offer a mo- tion to concur in the Senate amend- ment to the bill (H.R. 4) to declare it to be the policy of the United States to deploy a national missile defense. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LAHOOD). The Clerk will designate the motion. The text of the motion is as follows: Mr. Spence moves to concur in the Senate amendment. The text of the Senate amendment is as follows: Senate amendment: Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert: SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``National Missile Defense Act of 1999''. SEC. 2. NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE POLICY. It is the policy of the United States to deploy as soon as is technologically possible an effec- tive National Missile Defense system capable of defending the territory of the United States against limited ballistic missile attack (whether accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate) with funding subject to the annual authorization of appropriations and the annual appropriation of funds for National Missile Defense. SEC. 3. POLICY ON REDUCTION OF RUSSIAN NU- CLEAR FORCES. It is the policy of the United States to seek continued negotiated reductions in Russian nu- clear forces. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to House Resolution 179, the gen- tleman from South Carolina (Mr. SPENCE ) and the gentleman from Mis- souri (Mr. S KELTON ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. S PENCE ). Mr. SPENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in 1995, Norway launched a weather rocket that was mistaken by sensors in Russia for a launch of an ICBM from one of our nu- clear submarines. They were in a final countdown in the process of preparing to launch a missile attack against us, and only minutes away when they fi- nally discovered the mistake and called off the launch. We were that close to being faced with nuclear war- fare. Mr. Speaker, most people in this country do not realize we have no de- fense against that type of an attack nor do we have a defense against even one missile launched accidentally from somewhere else in the world today. There are literally thousands of these missiles abroad in the world today. The threat of ballistic missile attack is real and it is here today. Last summer, an independent study by the bipartisan Rumsfeld Commis- sion unanimously concluded that the ballistic missile threat to our country is broader, more mature and evolving more rapidly than anticipated, and that the United States may have littleor no warning of a ballistic missile at- tack. With each passing day, our Na- tion's vulnerability to missile attack grows. Rogue nations like North Korea, Libya, Iran and Iraq are working ag- gressively to acquire the capability to strike the American homeland with ballistic missiles carrying weapons of mass destruction. Russia and China al- ready possess this capability. I am con- fident that the more than 200 Members who attended the Rumsfeld Commis- sion extraordinary classified briefing here on this House floor back in March have a much greater appreciation of the need to move forward with missile defenses and of the reason why we need to make the kind of commitment that we are making in this bill. /ballot1445 Let me briefly make a few points: First, contrary to intelligence esti- mates that predicted the ballistic mis- sile threat was more than a decade away, the missile threat to our country is real, as I have said before, and it is here today. Second, technology has matured to the point where moving forward and deploying a national missile defense system is feasible. There will always be test failures, there will always be tech- nological challenges, but Americans have never shied away from a challenge and certainly never in the face of a threat that gets worse every day. Third, the cost of a national missile defense system, by the administra- tion's own estimates, will comprise less than 1 percent of the overall defense budget and less than 2 percent of our military modernization budget over the next 5 years. Because to deploy an initial national missile defense capa- bility will amount to less than the amount our country has spent on peacekeeping developments, deploying missiles in the past 6 years, this strikes me as a small price and a sound investment. Mr. Speaker, national missile defense is necessary, feasible and affordable, but in spite of the growing consensus that the threat is real and the tech- nology is maturing, the administration has steadfastly refused to commit to actually deploy a national missile de- fense. H.R. 4 addresses the administra- tion's unexplainable lack of commit- ment in this regard and represents the Congress' bipartisan belief that all Americans should be protected against ballistic missiles. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this important bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the motion to concur with the Senate amendments to H.R. 4, an act to de- clare it the policy of the United States to deploy national missile defense. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. D ICKS).Mr. DICKS. Mr. Speaker, I want to say to my friend from Missouri, the distinguished ranking member of the Committee on National Security, that I concur with him and that we should pass this, and I am not at all upset about what the Senate did. I think put- ting in the phrase ``when techno- logically feasible'' means that we have to have something to deploy. And I have the greatest respect for the chair- man of the committee but I must tell my colleagues, when we brought over the people who were running this pro- gram and we went through each of the various possibilities, they have said ba- sically that at this point we do not have something to deploy. Now, we just cannot make it up. Either it is deployable or it is not. Either we have tested it and we know it will work or it will not. So I urge everyone here that we should stay with our commitment to keep working on this problem, but to start deploying something that we have not tested is an absolute recipe for failure. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gen- tleman yielding to me. I hope that we get a national missile defense, but let us not waste money trying to deploy something that we have not yet dem- onstrated, and I think theater missile defense should be our first priority. I appreciate the gentleman having yield- ed to me. Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to continue very, very briefly, and then I will yield to the gentleman from Vir- ginia (Mr. S ISISKY ). At today's motion I would like to, and I hope we all understand that the technology needed to develop an ICBM capable of delivering a warhead of mass destruction against large portions of these United States is today, in the hands of at least one so-called rogue actor nation. Worse, much of the need- ed technology has already been dem- onstrated, and now I believe it is not only possible but probable that signifi- cant portions of the United States will be threatened by ICBM-delivered war- heads of mass destruction sometime before the year 2005, the time the ad- ministration says is needed to deploy a suitable limited national missile de- fense system. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. S ISISKY ). Mr. SISISKY. Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 4, and I ask my colleagues to sup- port it. As some of as my colleagues know, I changed my mind about the way we need to approach ballistic missile de- fense. I always believed we needed BMD, but over the last year I changed my mind about when we needed it, and that was because of the report of the Commission to Assess Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States. This was a bipartisan commission charged to as- sess the nature and magnitude of exist- ing and emerging ballistic missile threats to the United States.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3431 May 20, 1999 The report and testimony of the com- mission made two things clear. First, the ballistic missile threat to the United States may be coming faster than previously estimated. Second, the threat to our friends, allies and troops overseas already exists. That is why I cosponsored this bill, and that is why Congress overwhelm- ingly decided to go on record in sup- port of ballistic missile defense. Now I think there are legitimate grounds to be unhappy with the proce- dure we are using today. I think every- one on our side agrees that accepting a Senate amendment without benefit of a conference is not the best way to do this, and those of us in the House would have liked to sit down with Members of the other body to talk about what they mean by phrases like ``technologically feasible.'' And for an- other thing, it fails to recognize tire- less contributions and leadership of Members on our side, such as the gen- tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. WELDON ) and the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. S PRATT ), but it does make the point by putting Con- gress on record that it is the policy of the United States to deploy an effec- tive missile defense. On balance, Mr. Speaker, I think this language sends a message that is vital to national security, and I urge this body to support it. Mr. SPENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. WELDON ), the chairman of our Sub- committee on Military Research and Development. (Mr. WELDON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks and include extra- neous material.) Mr. WELDON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman and the ranking member for their support, and let me again clarify some points here. First of all, none of us are mandating that something be deployed before it is ready, none of us. We are not that naive to put a date certain on requiring that something be done by a certain time, and no one should misinterpret this legislation as requiring that. What we are saying is that we are making a clear and distinct policy change here as a Nation. For the first time we are saying publicly that it is the policy of this country to deploy a limited national missile defense sys- tem against those rogue threats that we see emerging. We took great efforts in this process to bring the Russians in, to show them that this was not aimed against them. In fact, a number of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle traveled with us to Moscow the week before the vote with the former CIA Director of the Clinton administration, Jim Woolsey, with the former Secretary of Defense and White House Chief of Staff, Donald Rumsfeld, and with the former Deputy Secretary of State, Bill Schneider, andwe took the time to give the Russian leadership the briefing as to the emerg- ing threats and convinced them that this was not being done to score some type of strategic advantage over Rus- sia. This was being done because in to- day's world North Korea is not a stable nation that deterrents will work with. In today's world the Chinese now have at least 18 long-range ICBMs. We know that Iran and Iraq both have medium- range missiles and are developing long- range capabilities. So, Mr. Speaker, for all of these rea- sons we are making a clear and distinct policy change that will occur when the President signs this bill. And the key thing that I want to keep stressing is, one, that when the President signs this bill, that is the change in policy of this government, that we are deploying a national missile defense system as soon as that technology is available, not be- fore it is available, not prematurely, but as soon as it is available. We do not recommend the technology. We do not say land-based over sea-based. We do not say one site over three sites. We say as soon as available and as soon as it is ready, we deploy it. That is a clear and marked difference over the policy that exists today, and for the White House to try to spin what we are doing is totally wrong. And I want the record to clearly show that this Congress and the other body are on record as interpreting our own bill, and there should be no one in the White House in future years who will try to spin what it is we are trying to accom- plish today. With that, Mr. Speaker, I would like to enter into a colloquy with our dis- tinguished chairman for the record. I rise to engage in a colloquy with the chairman. There has been some misconception concerning this national missile de- fense bill. The purpose of this bill is very simply to establish a U.S. policy, the deployment of a national missile defense, as soon as technologically pos- sible. In the chairman's view, does this bill commit the United States to de- ploy a national missile defense? Mr. SPENCE. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. WELDON of Pennsylvania. I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina. Mr. SPENCE. Mr. Speaker, it does. The intent of this bill is straight- forward and unequivocal. However, I understand that in a May 7 letter the President indicated, and I quote, the legislation makes clear that no deci- sion on deployment has been made, un- quote. Following the Senate passage of S. 257 earlier this year, the Secretary of State even sent a cable to our em- bassies articulating this same opinion. I do not understand how anyone could look at this legislation objec- tively and arrive at the same conclu- sion as the President and the Secretary of State. This bill makes it clear that the Nation is committed and is com- mitting to the deployment of a na- tional missile defense.Mr. WELDON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I insert for the R ECORD both the White House letter as well as the State Department cable so that every- one can see what type of spin the ad- ministration is trying to place on this bill. THEWHITE HOUSE , Washington, May 7, 1999. Hon. C URTWELDON , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARREPRESENTATIVE WELDON : Thank you for your letter on National Missile Defense (NMD). We are committed to meeting the growing danger that outlaw nations may de- velop and field long-range missiles capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction against the United States and our allies. Next year, we will determine whether to deploy for the first time a limited national missile defense against these threats. This decision will be made when we review the re- sults of flight tests and other developmental efforts, consider cost estimates, and evaluate the threat. In making our determination, we will also review progress in achieving our arms control objectives, including negoti- ating any amendments to the ABM Treaty that may be required to accommodate a pos- sible NMD deployment. I am pleased that the Senate, on a bipar- tisan basis, included in its NMD legislation two amendments that significantly changed the original bill, which I strongly opposed. By specifying that any NMD deployment must be subject to the authorization and ap- propriations process, the legislation makes clear that no decision on deployment has been made. By putting the Senate on record as continuing to support negotiated reduc- tions in strategic nuclear arms, the bill also reaffirms that our missile defense policy must take into account our arms control ob- jectives. We want to move ahead on the START III framework, which I negotiated with Presi- dent Yeltsin in 1997, to cut Russian and U.S. arsenals 90 percent from Cold War levels, while maintaining the ABM Treaty as a cor- nerstone of strategic stability. The changes made in the NMD bill during Senate debate ensure these crucial objectives will be taken into account fully as we pursue our NMD program. Thank you again for writing on this impor- tant matter. Sincerely, BILLCLINTON . S. 257\u00d0NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE Background.\u00d0U.S. policy regarding bal- listic missile defense most recently was elaborated in reftels (n.b., identical text to different addresses). During the March floor debate on S. 257, the Cochran National Mis- sile Defense (NMD) bill, the Senate on a bi- partisan basis adopted two very important amendments that modified the original bill that had been reported out of the Armed Services Committee on essentially a party- line vote last month. The first amendment makes clear that any deployment of a lim- ited U.S. NMD system must be subject to the authorization and appropriations process, thereby underscoring that no deployment de- cision has been made. The second amend- ment confirms that U.S. policy with regard to the possible deployment of a limited NMD system must take account of our objectives with regard to arms control. With these im- provements, the administration informed Senate leaders that it would accept S. 257 as amended if it reaches the President's desk in this form. On March 17, the Senate passed S. 257 (as amended) in a rollcall vote, 97\u00b13.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3432 May 20, 1999 Posts are authorized to draw upon the ma- terials contained herein in addressing this matter. The text of S. 257, as passed by the Senate is at paragraph 3. White House talk- ing points prepared by the National Security Council are at paragraph 4. The text of a statement by the President, released on March 17, is at paragraph 5. The text of S. 257 as passed by the Senate is as follows: Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress Assembled, Section 1. Short title. This act may be cited as the National Mis- sile Defense Act of 1999''. Section 2. National Missile Defense Policy. It is the policy of the United States to de- ploy as soon as is technologically possible an effective National Missile Defense System capable of defending the territory of the United States against limited ballistic mis- sile attack (whether accidental, unauthor- ized, or deliberate) with funding subject to the annual authorization of appropriations and the annual appropriation of funds for na- tional missile defense. Section 3. Policy on reduction of Russian nuclear forces. It is the policy of the United States to seek continued negotiated reductions in Russian Nuclear Forces. Begin White House Points: The administration made clear its strong opposition to the Cochran NMD bill as it emerged from the Armed Services Com- mittee last month. The Presidents senior na- tional security advisors recommended that the bill be vetoed were it to reach the Presi- dent's desk in that form. We are pleased that the Senate on two bi- partisan votes, adopted two very important amendments to the bill and thereby signifi- cantly improved it. The first amendment makes clear that no decision has been made to deploy a limited NMD system. It does so by specifying that any such decision must necessarily be sub- ject to the annual authorization and appro- priations process. The President has not proposed that any funds be authorized or appropriated in the FY2000 Defense Department budget for NMD deployment. Whether he requests such funds in FY 2000 (the first fiscal year in which the administration intends to address the de- ployment question) will depend on the ad- ministration's assessment of the four fac- tors. Which it believes must be taken into account in deciding whether to field this sys- tem: (1) Has the threat materialized as quickly as we now expect it will; (2) Has the technology been demonstrated to be operationally effective; (3) Is the system affordable; and (4) What are the implications of going for- ward with NMD deployment for our objec- tives with regard to achieving further reduc- tions in strategic nuclear arms under START II and START III? The second amendment makes clear that in pursuing our policy with regard to the de- ployment of a limited NMD, we must also take into account our objectives with regard to securing continued negotiated reductions in Russian and U.S. nuclear forces. Through START II and START III, the United States can realize the removal of up to an additional 8,000 Russian and U.S. stra- tegic nuclear warheads. These treaties are clearly in our national security interests. At the Helsinki Summit, Presidents-Clin- ton and Yeltsin declared that the ABM Trea- ty is of fundamental significance to the at- tainment of our objectives for START II and START III. In this context, it is crucial that the United States negotiate in good faith anyamendments to the AMB Treaty that may be necessary to accommodate any U.S. limited NMD system. The second Senate amendment affirms the Senate's recognition that the arms control dimension of the NMD deployment question must be taken into account. As a result of these two amendments, the administration will accept S. 257 if it reaches the President's desk in its current form. If asked\u00d0does this mean that the adminis- tration will hold NMD hostage to the ABM Treaty? The administration has articulated its strong commitment to the ABM Treaty, which it regards as a cornerstone of strategic stability. At the same time, the administra- tion has also made clear that it will not give Russia\u00d0or any other state\u00d0a veto over any missile defense deployment decision that it believes is vital to our national security in- terests. STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT I am pleased that the Senate, on a bipar- tisan basis, included in its National Missile Defense (NMD) legislation two amendments that significantly change the original bill, which I strongly opposed. By specifying that any NMD deployment must be subject to the authorization and appropriations process, the legislation now makes clear that no deci- sion on deployment has been made. By put- ting the Senate on record as continuing to support negotiated reductions in strategic nuclear arms, the bill reaffirms that our mis- sile defense policy must take into account our arms control objectives. We are committed to meeting the growing danger that outlaw nations will develop and deploy long-range missiles that could deliver weapons of mass destruction against us and our allies. Next year, we will, for the first time, determine whether to deploy a limited national missile defense against these threats, when we review the results of flight tests and other developmental efforts, con- sider cost estimates, and evaluate the threat. In making our determination, we will also review progress in achieving our arms control objectives, including negotiating any amendments to the Arm Treaty that may be required to accommodate a possible NMD de- ployment. This week, the Russian Duma took an en- couraging step toward obtaining final ap- proval of START II. We want to move ahead on the START III framework, which I nego- tiated with President Yeltsin in 1997, to cut Russian and U.S. arsenals 80 percent from cold war levels, while maintaining the Arm Treaty as a cornerstone of strategic sta- bility. The changes made in the NMD bill during Senate debate ensure these crucial objectives will be fully taken into account as we pursue our NMD Program. Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gen- tleman from South Carolina. We can- not have a policy to deploy without a commitment to deploy. In his letter the President also said, and I quote, next year we will deter- mine whether to deploy a limited na- tional missile defense, unquote. How- ever, when the President signs this bill into law, he will be committing the U.S. to deploy. When the President signs this bill, he is also committing the Nation to deploy a national missile defense system as soon as techno- logically possible. The law is the law. I would also like to ask the gen- tleman from South Carolina if the President is correct in his view that subjecting a national missile defense program to the authorization and ap-propriation process can somehow be in- terpreted as meaning the decision on deployment has not yet been made. Mr. SPENCE. Mr. Speaker, such an interpretation is not correct. The bill's language neither states nor implies anything of the sort. In fact, all De- partment of Defense programs are sub- ject to authorization and appropria- tion. This is a matter of current law in both Titles 10 and 31 of the U.S. Code. It is a constitutional requirement. Every weapon system we have de- ployed, bombers, missiles, tanks, fight- ers, ships and so on, goes through the authorization and the appropriation process. Deployment of these systems is simply the manifestation of policies that have been agreed upon to meet na- tional security requirements. Mr. WELDON of Pennsylvania. As the original author of this legislation, I fully agree. The administration has now recognized the threat, as evi- denced by the CIA, and when the Presi- dent signs this bill, he will be commit- ting the Nation to the deployment of a national missile defense to meet that threat. I would also state that in signing this bill the President is indicating a com- mitment to use the funds he has budg- eted for national missile defense only for the execution of the policy he en- acts and endorses by signing this legis- lation. Mr. SPENCE. Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gentleman. The President has budgeted $10.5 billion through fiscal year 2005 to support national missile defense deployment. When the Presi- dent signs this bill, I believe it also re- flects a commitment that these funds will be used to resolve the pro- grammatic issues, to establish the technological feasibility of a national missile defense and, finally, to deploy a national missile defense system. /ballot1500 Mr. WELDON of Pennsylvania. Does the chairman believe that this bill in any way conditions deployment of a national missile defense system on fur- ther arms reductions with the Rus- sians? Mr. SPENCE. I do not. The section of this bill dealing with the arms reduc- tion with the Russians is consistent with the current arms control policy and only reflects Congress' support for continued negotiations. There is no ex- plicit or implicit linkage in H.R. 4 be- tween achieving arms control reduc- tions and the commitment to deploy national missile defense. Mr. WELDON of Pennsylvania. I agree with the chairman. Russia, or any other country, does not now have nor will it ever have a veto over our Nation's deployment of a national mis- sile defense to protect our citizens. Mr. SPENCE. I thank my friend and colleague for his strong interest in clarifying the record on this important legislation.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3433 May 20, 1999 Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gen- tleman from New Jersey (Mr. A N- DREWS ). (Mr. ANDREWS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the underlying amendments and the underlying bill as well. I thank and congratulate the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. S PENCE ), the chairman, and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. S KELTON ), the ranking member, and in particular my col- leagues the gentleman from Pennsyl- vania (Mr. W ELDON ) and the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. S PRATT ) for their efforts in this behalf. At a time of multiplying chaos in the world, this bill gives us a measure of certainty. The sources of chaos are technological as new weapons systems and new instruments of terrorism pro- liferate every day. The sources of chaos are political as new states are imposed upon ancient religious and ethnic rival- ries. The only thing that is certain in our political evaluation is that there will be more chaos in the years to come. The certainty that is behind this bill is that we are making a decision for certain as a Congress that it will be the policy of this country to deploy and defend ourselves in the very best way we can with a national missile de- fense system. The arguments against this bill are diplomatic, economic and strategic. I find each of the arguments lacking. The diplomatic argument against this bill is that it will somehow destabilize the world. I think the greatest source of desta- bilization is the risks that an acci- dental or rogue launch could plunge the nuclear powers of the world into an irreversible course of mutual destruc- tion. I think a viable defense system is an instrument of stability, not insta- bility. For those who raise economic objec- tions to this bill, yes, it is expensive. Yes, every dollar of taxpayers' money that we spend must be spent carefully, but it is important to understand the narrow scope of the expenditure that is before us. In this year's budget, for ex- ample, about one nickel out of every $100 that we spend as a government will be dedicated to this purpose. One nickel out of every $100 is, in my judg- ment, a prudent and sound investment for the defense of the country. For those who raise strategic objec- tions, I would simply say that every strategic instrument that is possible to be at our disposal should be so. Will this succeed today techno- logically? Of course not, but we cannot succeed technologically, we cannot reach the goal technologically until we have the goal. When President Kennedy in the early sixties said we would get to the Moon as the first country in the world that would do so, it was impossible techno- logically at that time, but because heset that goal and we followed it as a country we set in means the creative resources of the country and we did achieve it. I believe the same thing will and can happen here. It is for those reasons that I would urge both Republican and Democratic colleagues to support this piece of leg- islation. Mr. SPENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. A RMEY ), the majority leader. Mr. ARMEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from South Carolina for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, just a few days after Congress first enacted this legislation, or acted on this legislation, the State Department sent an internal cable to our embassies abroad instructing them to explain away the President's sup- port for the bill. That cable, which Mr. Weldon just placed in the R ECORD , told these em- bassies to say, in effect, even though Congress has passed and the President has endorsed legislation committing America to deploy a national missile defense, do not worry because the President intends to use loopholes to deny that commitment. In this way, the Clinton State De- partment sought to comfort foreign governments who feared that we might render their offensive missile programs harmless and obsolete. Just what are the alleged loopholes the President was to seize upon? Be- cause the bill says that funds for mis- sile defense are subject to annual ap- propriations and authorization, the President thinks he can sign it without really committing to protect our citi- zens from missile attack. This is, of course, ludicrous. The en- tire Defense Department is subject to annual appropriations. Much of the Federal Government is. Those words merely restate the obvious. They do not add or detract any significant meaning from the bill. When John F. Kennedy committed to America to land a man on the Moon in his decade, that commitment was no less real because the money for the space program had to be appropriated each year. Neither is this commitment. The President is seizing on this lan- guage to conceal that he and his party have been forced to flip-flop on missile defense. After over a decade spent op- posing missile defense, they have been mugged by reality. The reality of a North Korean ICBM test, the South- west Asia arms race, the Ayotollah's missile program, the theft of our nu- clear secrets by Communist China, and the spread of missile technology around the globe. Once the cable to Moscow and Beijing and elsewhere came to light, we consid- ered trying to rewrite the bill but then we realized, what would be the point. If the President and his aides can so ab- surdly misconstrue even the most in- nocuous language, then there are no words that might have fixed meaning for this administration. All we can dohere is make our intentions and the meanings crystal clear. Let me do so. This bill commits the United States to deploy an effective national missile defense system as soon as is technologically possible. If the President disagrees with this position, if he truly believes that we should leave our citizens vulnerable to missile attack, he should show the character of a true leader and say so, without dis- assembling, without equivocation, without seizing on nonexistent loop- holes. He should veto the bill. If, on the other hand, he signs the bill, we can, by rights, conclude that he agrees with the plain English meaning of the bill and that is that the United States is committed to deploy a na- tional missile defense as soon as is technologically possible. I will close with this: The President's endorsement of this language, what- ever his private feelings on it, is a trib- ute to the vast public support that now exists for national missile defense. It shows that the debate that Ronald Reagan started in 1983 has now been de- cisively won by those who believe that the American people need a defense that defends. I am very proud that today we are taking this important step to defend the American people from missile at- tack. I am very proud that in this age of high technology we can use that technology to give our children that which is better than what they have had, the technology of the 1950s of duck and cover. Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Maine (Mr. A LLEN ). Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. SKELTON ) for yielding me this time. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation. There were many reasons to vote against the original House bill, H.R. 4. There are even more reasons to vote against the bill as amended by the Senate. H.R. 4 provided that it is the policy of the United States to deploy a na- tional missile defense. I opposed all 15 words of H.R. 4 because of what it did not say. It failed to acknowledge how much national missile defense would cost, whether it would undermine arms control and whether a national missile defense would actually work. On the other hand, the authors of H.R. 4, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. WELDON ) and the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. S PRATT ), saw vir- tue in what it did not say. As I look at the Senate amendment, I think that the gentleman from Penn- sylvania (Mr. W ELDON ) and the gen- tleman from South Carolina (Mr. SPRATT ) have a point. The Senate's version says that it is the policy of the United States to de- ploy, as soon as technologically pos- sible, an effective national missile de- fense system. As soon as techno- logically possible, what does that mean? One test? Two tests? A really good simulation?CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3434 May 20, 1999 There is a huge difference between technologically possible and techno- logically viable, or technologically re- liable. We should not commit to deploy until a system is fully and successfully demonstrated. Rushing deployment leaves us vulnerable to failure. This bill may only be a national mis- sile defense policy statement but it sets us on a slippery slope. Hit-to-kill technology has only succeeded in 5 of 19 intercept tests. Now to be sure, some of those failures are in the booster phase and people believe they can be corrected, but if we have another THAAD, which has failed on all six flight tests, we should not deploy NMD. For other major defense systems, we fly before we buy; but for NMD, how- ever, we are buying before we fly, and that is not right. The U.S. should decide to deploy a national missile defense not today but only if it is tested rigorously and prov- en to work; only if it does not under- mine overall U.S. national security, by jeopardizing mutual nuclear reductions and the ABM treaty, and only if it is needed as a cost effective defense avail- able against nations with ballistic mis- siles. Let me provide some perspective on this Congress' approach to national se- curity. This bill rushes to deploy an unproven national missile defense to defend against an ill-defined future threat. Yet this House recently refused to support the deployment of our men and women in uniform to save lives and bring peace to the Balkans. Madam Speaker, in the Middle Ages the king would command the alchemist to turn lead into gold but no amount of money or political will could turn lead into gold. Unlike alchemy, national missile defense may work some day but we cannot deny that there is more to national missile defense than wishing it into existence. Please defeat this bill. Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time remains on each side? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. EMERSON ). The gentleman from Mis- souri (Mr. S KELTON ) has 19 minutes re- maining and the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. S PENCE ) has 14 minutes remaining. Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. T URNER ). Mr. TURNER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4. I was pleased to be a cosponsor of the origi- nal legislation sponsored by the gen- tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. WELDON ), the chairman of the Sub- committee on Military Research and Development of the Committee on Armed Services that I serve on. I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. W ELDON ) for his leadership, as well as the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. S PENCE ) and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. SKELTON ), for their work. This bill recognizes the reality of the world in which we live today, a worldthat is a much more dangerous place, a world in which we face threats from rogue nations like Iran and Iraq and North Korea. The threat of unauthor- ized, or intentional or unintentional ballistic missile attack is a very real one. This bill addresses that threat that we face. The people of our country do not re- alize that we are defenseless against a nuclear missile attack. They do not re- alize that a missile launched from North Korea would take a mere 23 min- utes to reach the continental United States. In fact, it would take only 32 minutes for that missile to reach my home district in Texas. These figures are startling, but it does reinforce the fact that we must take steps today to defend ourselves against this threat. I join with the many colleagues in this House who are supporting this leg- islation today, because we believe that our country has no choice but to make this investment in our defense. This bill requires that the system be de- ployed only after it is determined to be technologically possible to implement such a system. That is the right way to proceed, and I am very confident that our military and the scientists of our country will have the ability to put such a system in place. We stand here today united in an ef- fort to defend our country against threats that we have to face in today's world. I am confident that this bill will do the job, and I urge all of my col- leagues to join in supporting H.R. 4. /ballot1515 Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Oregon (Mr. D EFAZIO). Mr. D EFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. It is particularly ironic that we are having the debate this week with the release of the latest Star Wars movie. We might title this ``Star Wars, the Phantom Solution,'' because that is what this is. This is a phantom solu- tion. Hitting a bullet with a bullet in outer space to intercept a North Ko- rean missile. Now, let us think about it a minute. North Korea has not yet built the mis- sile, it has not been successfully tested, but they might build one or two and put warheads on them. Well, one thing that works in our arsenal of the anti- ballistic missile defense is the radar. We can track the warheads. Guess what? The second they shoot some- thing at us, we will know. Guess what? We have thousands of nuclear warheads with which to retaliate if they have shot at us. Will they do that? No. This is not a real threat to the United States of America, single mis- siles launched that could be tracked back to their source. Any nut who is going to attack the United States with weapons of mass destruction is going to do it in an undetectable manner, and yet we are doing nothing to deal with bioterrorism, chemical terrorism,smuggled nuclear weapons, while we spend billions over here to make the defense contractors happy who have yet to conduct a successful defense test after spending nearly $50 billion. So what is the solution? Hurry up and deploy it. Deploy what? The phan- tom system against the phantom men- ace. This is real life; it is not a movie. We have to make tough choices. Are we going to defend America against real threats? Are we going to fund pay raises for the young men and women in the military? Or are we going to throw more billions after billions in a failed dream, a dream of Ronald Reagan which was put forward back in the 1980s, an impenetrable shield above the United States? We all know that even if this thing works, we can bring in a submarine and launch under it, or terrorists certainly can smuggle in a nuclear weapon. This does not defend the United States against real threats. I say to my colleagues, do not, do not do this. Do not destabilize the ABM Treaty. Do not waste our precious re- sources, and do not give people a false sense of security while we are letting real threats go unchallenged. Vote ``no.'' Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Ohio (Mr. T RAFICANT ). (Mr. TRAFICANT asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. TRAFICANT. Madam Speaker, it reminds me of the patent chief com- menting about the invention of the telephone who said, who is kidding whom about this rip-off? Anybody that believes that two Americans will be able to speak through a wire across town is trying to steal your money. I say to my colleagues, I support this bill. I support this chairman, the rank- ing member, and I support the distin- guished Members who are responsible for bringing it. We cannot protect America any longer with a Neighbor- hood Crime Watch, and I am not just concerned about rogue action. If my colleagues have seen the latest report of a classified Pentagon release, China has developed a super missile that has been labeled by the Pentagon ``invincible.'' Invincible. They have seen nothing like it. Now, what infuri- ates me is the report further goes on to say it is American tax dollars that built it, with a $60 billion trade surplus China enjoys now. But what really frosts me, the report goes on to say that the design of the invincible mis- sile is basically the design that was stolen from America. We have a problem. We have a major problem. And to those naysayers, let me say this. Our number one duty is to secure the national security, to protect your citizens and my citizens, in your towns, in my town, in every town of the United States of America. And with all of the technology we have, I want to compliment the wisdom of theCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3435 May 20, 1999 leaders here, we can intercept their missile. Invincible, my ascot. Madam Speaker, I want to close out by saying the stealing of our secrets should be investigated, and let the chips fall where they may. I want to know how China got access to these se- crets. Second of all, the President and Congress better come together and pro- vide for an umbrella of security for this Nation. It may not be a total, 100 per- cent fail-safe program, but by God, our military has done quite well on inter- cepting foreign missiles. Mr. SPENCE. Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. W ELDON ). (Mr. WELDON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WELDON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I thank my distin- guished chairman for yielding me this time. I just want to again clarify for the record that the gentleman who spoke earlier made the point that North Korea has not yet built a missile. Well, if the gentleman would go talk to George Tenet or Bob Walpole at the CIA, he could receive a classified brief- ing where they are now publicly saying that North Korea on August the 31st fired the Taepo Dong 1 missile. Maybe he does not believe the CIA, and that is something that I cannot comment on. Mr. D EFAZIO. Madam Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. WELDON of Pennsylvania. I yield to the gentleman from Oregon. Mr. D EFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I was at the so-called classified briefing which was conducted by people who are consultants for defense contractors, and actually, subsequently it has turned out the test was not entirely successful, despite their protestations at that time. Mr. WELDON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time, if the gentleman would talk to Bob Walpole, who is our CIA expert on stra- tegic threats, the test itself shows that North Korea now, in the minds of our intelligence community, can, in fact fire a three-stage Taepo Dong 1 missile with a light payload that would hit a city in the U.S. Now, what they say is it will not be accurate. They may aim for St. Louis and hit Dallas, but if one lives in Dal- las, does it really matter that it is not accurate? The point is that the gentle- man's CIA agents and his own adminis- tration have now said publicly that North Korea has the capability today. Second point, he mentioned that we are not dealing with other threats. Again, I would ask the gentleman, al- though since he has left the floor I can- not ask him personally, if he would comment on our past five defense au- thorization bills, because in each of those bills with the leadership of the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. S KEL- TON), along with the leadership of the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. SPENCE ) and Members on both sides ofthe aisle, we have plussed up funding in the area of weapons of mass destruc- tion and cyber terrorism to a higher amount than the administration has ever requested. We did not do that one year, we did it all five years. We have given this ad- ministration money that they did not ask for to deal with the threats of a terrorist device, the threats of coming through our ports. We take that threat very seriously, and we are dealing with it. So when the gentleman says that we do not care or we are not concerned about other threats, he is totally mis- informed or just has not gotten the lat- est brief. Let me say at this point I want to ac- knowledge the intellectual honesty of the gentleman from Maine (Mr. ALLEN ). He came down to the well and in a very intellectually honest way op- posed what we are doing. I respect him for that. I respect the other 105 Mem- bers of this body, 104 Members, 102 Democrats and two Republicans, who voted against what we are doing, be- cause intellectually they are being pure. What I really have a problem with are those Members in the other body who want to have cover; who have con- sistently opposed missile defense but then came up with nonsensical amend- ments to now say they are for missile defense. The gentlewoman from Cali- fornia, one of the Senators from Cali- fornia who has consistently opposed missile defense, with these amend- ments now says she can support this bill. That is outrageously simplistic and it is not being intellectually hon- est. I would rather have those Members do like the gentleman from Maine (Mr. ALLEN ) and oppose the bill because they oppose the policy. We just disagree. Let me say this, Madam Speaker. We passed this bill overwhelmingly in the House. The Sen- ate passed a bill that we are consid- ering today overwhelmingly in the Senate. The President then came out and issued this letter that is now a part of the Record where he said we will make the decision in a year. Now, what is he saying? In a year we will decide whether or not the threat has changed. Well, Madam Speaker, his own CIA is saying the threat is here today. It is not going to change a year from now. It is already here. He is say- ing that we will have to evaluate the cost. He has already requested $10.5 bil- lion in his five-year budget. So why would the President then want to wait a year after we are making a policy de- cision today? I hate to say this because this has been a totally bipartisan effort, and I applaud my colleagues on the other side for their leadership, because with- out that we probably would not be here today. But I can tell my colleagues why I think the President is saying postpone it for a year. He wants to give Vice President G OREa major campaign appearance where, in the middle of the spring of next year, he will hold a pressconference and with all the gravity he can bring as the Vice President, he will say that we now have to deploy a na- tional missile defense system. Well, I want to let the President know, if the President is listening, and I would say to my colleagues I want to let the President know through them that we see through that facade. We are not going to stand here today and pass this bill and make this change, and have the President or the Vice President plan some kind of a political event a year from now so that they can enhance their standing in the polls. This bill means that when this Presi- dent signs it, the policy to deploy on behalf of this country is today. I thank my colleagues and the lead- ership in both parties for supporting this momentous piece of legislation. Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. R EYES ). Mr. REYES. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. I rise today in support of this bill, al- though somewhat reluctantly. As an original cosponsor of H.R. 4 and a long- time proponent of national missile de- fense, I want to be supportive of this bill. However, I have several concerns that I must express on the floor today. Like many of my colleagues, I sup- ported this bill as originally drafted, both for what it said and for what it did not say. That bill did not say when a national missile defense system must be deployed, how a national missile de- fense system must be deployed, nor where a national missile defense sys- tem would be deployed. It did not in- clude extra provisions that are not suf- ficiently defined, like ``technologically possible.'' Our bill also did not include language that could upset our col- leagues in the Duma, something that is very important to us as we move to- wards better relations with Russia. The Senate version which we are now being forced to take or leave today states that it is the policy of the United States to seek continued nego- tiated reductions in Russian nuclear forces. I understand the need to con- tinue negotiating with the Russians, because that is the issue with the re- duction in nuclear forces. However, traditionally, negotiations have in- cluded both reductions between the So- viet Union and between the United States. The Senate language could be perceived by the Duma as an insult be- cause it includes only a reduction in their forces and it does not address re- ductions in ours. Another concern is aimed directly at the other body as a whole. Many of us were under the impression that we would have the opportunity to go to conference with the Senate and work on a compromise between those two bills. Instead, the Senate simply chose to retain only our bill number and re- turn the bill to us with their language. As I noted, I have been a long time supporter of national missile defense.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3436 May 20, 1999 Some critics of deploying a national missile defense system argue that the technology is not proven. National missile defense will use hit-to-kill technology. It is like hitting a bullet with a bullet. Recently, another one of DOD's hit- to-kill missile defense programs, the PAC\u00b13, showed that this technology can work. I repeat, this technology can and does work. The PAC\u00b13 interceptor successfully destroyed the target over White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico this past March. I know that perfecting national mis- sile defense technology will be more difficult than for the PAC\u00b13. However, I just want to make sure that all of my colleagues in this House understand that the Army has proven the hit-to- kill concept. I also want to reiterate what my good friend C URTWELDON said earlier. THAAD is not a failure. Again, THAAD is not a failure. THAAD has accom- plished 28 of its 30 milestones. Every time THAAD has failed to intercept the target missile, it has done so, but has shown that the failure was due to a low-tech problem. These problems with the THAAD have been quality control issues, not design defects. We need to show our support of na- tional missile defense and move for- ward with a program as quickly as we can. As such, I will support this bill today and I also urge all of my col- leagues to do so. It is vital to the secu- rity of this Nation that we move for- ward on this issue today. Mr. SPENCE. Madam Speaker, I re- serve the balance of my time. Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to merely say that much has changed since the Strategic Defense Initiative debate was born some 16 years ago, and a lot has changed since last year. So I ask all of the Members, Madam Speak- er, to approach this bill, H.R. 4, as amended, with an open mind, as a good-faith effort to establish a bipar- tisan consensus on defending America. I intend to vote for it. I urge all of my colleagues to do the same. Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal- ance of my time. /ballot1530 Mr. SPENCE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con- sume. We should not have to be here today. People cannot understand the frustrations we have had over a long period of time in having to literally fight our own government to protect our own people. I will just go back to recent history. In 1996 we provided for national missile defense for our people, to protect our people from missile attack. The Presi- dent vetoed that legislation. We have been trying time and time again since that time. No one could imagine the hoops we have had to jump through in an effort to force our government to protect our own people. One example, just for the R ECORD , to show the extent to which our own ad-ministration will go in an effort to re- sist our efforts to defend our people. Back when the bill was vetoed in 1996, the administration had a politi- cized intelligence estimate put out by the CIA, the national intelligence esti- mate. It goes in part like this: Aside from the declared nuclear powers, it will be 10 years before any rogue Na- tion can develop the capability to threaten this country with missile at- tacks. When I saw that, I said, my gosh, what about the declared nuclear pow- ers? Are they not a threat? They were just brushed aside. And what about the fact that a Nation which does not have a capability can simply purchase a ca- pability from someone else? They do not have to develop their own capa- bility themselves from scratch, we say, they can buy it. So I called up the Director of the CIA at that time in an effort to get him to issue a clarifying estimate that was not misleading to the American people, because the American people had been lulled into a false sense of security. Well, the result was that the Director refused to change the estimate reflect- ing those things, so we had to appoint an outside commission, a bipartisan outside commission of intelligence ex- perts, to assess the threat and report back to Congress of what their findings might be. They reported back and they con- firmed what we had said. Instead of 10 years to develop a capability, we would have little or no warning, according to this report. On the part about taking 10 years to develop a capability, they confirmed what we said by giving an example of how China sold, intact, a mobile inter- continental ballistic missile system to another country. This other country becomes nuclear-capable overnight by simply buying the system. This is just one example of what we have had to do along this line to get us to this place today. I hope that we are on our way now with the passage of this legislation. I pray that it is, and I pray that it is in time, and that we can develop a defense before we are actu- ally faced with an attack. Mr. HASTERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4 which states that it is the policy of the United States to deploy a national missile defense. I am convinced that this measure should and will pass by a large bi- partisan majority. I am also convinced that the President of the United States will sign this im- portant piece of legislation. In doing so the President will make a historic decision, a deci- sion to protect the United States and its peo- ple from the grave threat of missile attack. Today the United States faces these threats defenseless, unable to stop even a single mis- sile launched at the United States. And yet there are dark clouds on the horizon. Coun- tries like North Korea and Iran are moving ahead undaunted with weapons of mass de- struction programs, including intercontinental ballistic missiles. The United States and the American people are at risk now, and H.R. 4 states clearly that we must do something to respond to these threats.I would also like to take a moment to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his tire- less work and leadership on this critical issue. It is rare that one individual can make such a difference on behalf of his country. The bipar- tisan support for this measure is a tribute to his hard work and dedication to protecting the American people from a clear and imminent threat. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this vital measure. Mrs. FOWLER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this bill. It is imperative that we move forward to counter the growing ballistic missile threat. Today our nation has absolutely no ability whatsoever to shoot down an incoming bal- listic missile\u00d0even one fired by accident. Meanwhile, rogue and terrorist states like North Korea and Iran are committing signifi- cant resources towards the development of these weapons. Last August, North Korea\u00d0 notwithstanding the severe famine now going on there\u00d0launched a three-stage ballistic mis- sile, demonstrating an ability to threaten United States territory for the first time. Like- wise, Iran is actively seeking long-range mis- siles that could threaten our nation. This bill reflects the Congress's bipartisan concern about this situation, and expresses the belief that all Americans should be pro- tected against this very real threat. It will make it the policy of the United States to deploy a national missile defense system to defend against a limited attack as soon as techno- logically possible. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. FARR of California. Mr. Speaker, I im- plore my colleagues to not commit the United States to a flawed policy with a flawed proc- ess. It is a flawed policy to commit the United States to a missile defense policy that hasn't been proven technologically feasible. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, one of our nation's highest military leaders, said ``the simple fact is that we do not yet have the technology to field a national missile defense.'' It is a flawed policy to commit the United States to a missile defense policy with an open-ended price tag. Since 1962 we have spent $120 billion to develop missile defense system. We paid $67 billion for the failed ``Star Wars'' initiative. In the last 10 years we have put some $40 million into the program. At $4.2 billion this year, missile defense is the largest single weapons program in the de- fense budget. What about our other defense priorities? It is a flawed policy to maintain a defense posture at the expense of all other domestic priorities. We have not yet saved Social Security, we have not reduced class size, we have not pro- vided for health care for all Americans. In our zeal to protect our democracy we are actually jeopardizing our democracy by failing to protect our domestic tranquility. I urge the defeat of H.R. 4. Mr. SPENCE.

Madam Speaker, I am pleased to an- nounce that we have concluded legisla- tive business for the week. The House will not be in session on Friday, May 21. The House will next meet on Monday, May 24, at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and at 2 o'clock p.m. for legislative business. We will consider a number of bills under suspension of the rules, a list of which will be distributed to all Members' offices. Members should note that we expect votes after 6 o'clock p.m. on Monday, May 24. On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thurs- day of next week, the House will take up: H.R. 1259, the Social Security and Medicare Safety Deposit Box Act of 1999; H.R. 1833, the United States Trade Representative and Customs Service Reauthorization Act; H.R. 150, the Education Land Grant Act; The Agriculture Appropriations Act; The Legislative Branch Appropria- tions Act; and H.R. 1401, the Defense Authorization Act. On Tuesday, May 25, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for morning hour and at 10 a.m. for legislative business. On Wednesday, May 26, and Thurs- day, May 27, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for legislative business. Madam Speaker, we hope to conclude legislative business for the week by 6 p.m. on Thursday, May 27. I would like to remind Members that the Memorial Day District Work Pe- riod begins following the close of legis- lative business on Thursday, May 27. And the House will return on Monday, June 7, with votes after 6 p.m. Ms. D ELAURO. Madam Speaker, re- claiming my time, I thank the major- ity leader for the schedule. If I might just ask one or two questions about the schedule for next week. Does my colleague know what days the Social Security Lock Box bill and the appropriations bills will be called up? Mr. ARMEY. Madam Speaker, if the gentlewoman would continue to yield, I thank the gentlewoman for asking. On Tuesday, we expect to do the Lock Box and the Agriculture Appro-priations bill. It is our expectation that on Wednesday we will be able to do Legislative Branch Appropriations, the Education Land Grant, and USTR- Customs. On Thursday, we would begin work on DOD authorization. If the gentlewoman would continue to yield, I should encourage Members to anticipate that we may be working later into the evenings on these eve- nings next week. As our past experi- ence tells us, when we enter appropria- tions season and we begin to consider these bills under the 5-minute rule, they may oftentimes take longer days than other legislative business under more time-constrained rules. Ms. D ELAURO. Madam Speaker, the majority leader anticipated my ques- tion in wanting to know if there were going to be any late nights next week. So we should anticipate late nights next week. And a final question: I do not see on the agenda listed out for next week anything about campaign finance re- form on the schedule. Does the gen- tleman from Texas know when we might be able to expect any action on that issue? Mr. ARMEY. Madam Speaker, again, I thank the gentlewoman for her in- quiry. And if the gentlewoman would continue to yield, we have had several discussions with different Members that have interest in this matter. As the gentlewoman knows, we are going into the appropriations season. The appropriations season is very im- portant in terms of its early conclusion in order to get into the final end-of- the-year appropriations conference re- ports. It is our anticipation that, while we expect this important issue to be ad- dressed before the year is over, that we would like to get this appropriations work behind us so that we would have time to address that during which pe- riod they are in their conference com- mittees. So I would guess that she should have an anticipation that it would be sometime later in the year. Ms. D ELAURO. Sometime later in the year. Mr. ARMEY. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the House join me in wishing my son, Scott, happy birthday tomorrow. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. EMERSON ). Is there objection to the re- quest of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. /fdash OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY MONTH (Mr. DOGGETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, oc- cupational therapy is a health and re- habilitation profession that helps peo- ple regain development and build skills that are important for independent functioning, health, well-being, and happiness. Occupational therapy em- ploys purposeful occupational tasks, the kind of thing that we do in our ev-eryday life, to return individuals with disability to function. The American Occupational Therapy Association has a motto that expresses it so very well. ``Occupational Therapy: Skills for the Job of Living.'' In Texas and across the Nation, we recently recognized contributions of this important profession with an offi- cial designation of Occupational Ther- apy Month. Our therapists help those whose lives are dramatically impacted by injury or stroke. They help people return to work and resume their place in the community. They work in the aid and development of children. They assist parents in developing and im- proving the skills necessary to partici- pate in school, work, play, or leisure activities. My wife, Libby, has had an oppor- tunity to see firsthand the incredible work that our occupational therapists perform to improve the quality of life for individuals with disabilities. I join in recognizing the significant benefits of occupational therapy for Americans from childhood to old age and salute the efforts of our occupational thera- pists across the country. /fdash ADJOURNMENT TO MONDAY, MAY 24, 1999 Mr. JONES of North Carolina.

Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Madam Speaker, today I rise with my col- league, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SILVESTRE REYES ), to stand up for the men and women who guard our Na- tion's borders and risk their lives every day. Today, with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. R EYES ), I will introduce the Border Patrol Recruitment and Reten- tion Act of 1999. The legislation willCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3439 May 20, 1999 provide incentives and support for re- cruiting and retaining Border Patrol agents. This legislation would increase the compensation of Border Patrol agents, and allow the Border Patrol agency to recruit its own agents with- out relying on personnel officers of the Department of Justice or the INS. The United States is in dire need of more Border Patrol agents to enforce policies against illegal immigration and drug smuggling. Under current law, the INS is authorized to add a total of 5,000 additional border agents at a rate of 1,000 per fiscal year from 1997 to 2001. We have not met our goals. The INS has only recruited between 200 and 400 new agents because salaries and the re- cruitment skills have not been up to par. My legislation will increase the sala- ries and work harder at retention, and salute those men and women who serve us very ably at the border. It is time now to give more respect to our border agents. Madam Speaker, I rise to the floor of the House today to stand up for a group of men and women who guard our nation's borders and risk their very lives everyday. The group of men and women whom I am referring to are the United States Border Patrol. Today, along with my colleague from Texas, Mr. R EYES, I in- troduce the ``Border Patrol Recruitment and Retention Act of 1999.'' This legislation will provide incentives and support for recruiting and retaining Border Pa- trol agents. This legislation would increase the compensation for Border Patrol agents and allow the Border Patrol agency to recruit its own agents without relying on personnel of- fices of the Department of Justice or INS. The United States is in dire need of more Border Patrol agents to enforce policies against illegal immigration and drug smug- gling. Under current law, the INS is authorized to add a total of five thousand additional bor- der patrol agents, at a rate of five thousand additional border patrol agents, at a rate of one thousand per fiscal year from 1997 to 2001. However, INS did not request any addi- tional agents in its FY 2000 budget due in large part to the lucrative job market and the low unemployment rate. According to Commissioner Meissner of the INS, only 200 to 400 new agents will be hired this year. Arizona had been slated to receive approximately 400 of the full complement but will not likely receive between 100\u00b1150, and my home state of Texas, which would have received approximately 500 new agents this year, could see that number cut by more than half. The ``Border Patrol Recruitment and Reten- tion Enhancement Act'' would move Border Patrol agents with one year's agency experi- ence from the federal government's GS\u00b19 pay level (approximately $34,000 annually) to GS\u00b1 11 (approximately $41,000 annually) next year. We need better recruitment and better retention. We cannot play with the nation's borders, and right now in the Immigration and Claims subcommittee in which I am a Ranking Member, we listen to testimony hearing after hearing about how the Border Patrol agents need more money, and the INS needs to be given the resources to be able to do it. This legislation is the step in that direction.Madam Speaker, we are a nation of immi- grants and a nation of laws. The ``Border Pa- trol Recruitment and Retention Act of 1999,'' will give us the ability to control our borders and uphold the law. I urge my colleagues to join me and Mr. R EYES, who is our resident expert on Border Patrol matters due to his service as a Border Patrol Sector Chief to support this much needed measure. /fdash SPECIAL ORDERS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of Jan- uary 6, 1999, and under a previous order of the House, the following Members will be recognized for 5 minutes each. /fdash REGARDING LATEST SHOOTING IN ATLANTA The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen- tleman from Illinois (Mr. H ASTERT ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. HASTERT. Madam Speaker, the latest shooting in an Atlanta school is deeply troubling. My wife is a teacher in a public school. My kids have gone to a public school. I taught for a lot of years in a public school. I fervently believe that every child deserves to learn in a good school and in a safe environment. But how can we create such an environment if it is the children themselves who make the schools unsafe? Clearly, we need to tighten current laws to make it more difficult for kids to get guns. We will take a look at the measure passed by the Senate to make sure that it is a reasonable and com- mon sense approach. We also need to more effectively en- force the laws that are already on the books and to prosecute those who break the laws. But these measures will fall short if we do not effectively address the deeper problems that face our society and our children. Our children need to learn the dif- ferences between right and wrong. They need moral instruction. They need a culture that reinforces positive values that help create a safer and more secure society. It is more difficult to be a parent today. We feel the need to work harder just to keep pace with the neighbors. All too often, parents are forced to worry first about their jobs and then about their kids. And it is becoming more and more difficult for parents to monitor what their kids are watching, hearing, and learning. I support free expression, but there is a point where unbridled free expression undermines a free society. I challenge the entertainment industry, the Inter- net industry, the video game industry, and the media to become good cor- porate citizens. Monitor the material that flows to our kids. I applaud the Disney Company for taking some steps in the right direc- tion, but the whole industry must join in the cause. Keep casual gunplay out of the movies. Keep hate music out ofthe music stores. Keep bomb-making web sites off the Internet. Do not make video games so violent that they warp young minds. Free expression does not necessarily have to lead to moral chaos. Let us join together in finding ways to help parents raise their children to be good productive citizens. /fdash GOD BLESS AMERICA'S VETERANS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen- tleman from North Carolina (Mr. JONES ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I have the privilege of representing the Third District of North Carolina. The Third District cov- ers most of the eastern part of the State, including five military bases: Cherry Point Marine Corps Air Sta- tion, New River Marine Corps Air Sta- tion, Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, Elizabeth City Coast Guard Station, and Camp Lejeune Marine Corps Base. In eastern North Carolina we are also proud to be the home of 77,000 thousand of our Nation's 25 million living vet- erans. Madam Speaker, these are the men and women who courageously served to protect this country and pre- serve the principles that it was founded upon. Out of respect and appreciation, we must ensure the sacrifice these brave soldiers made is something we never forget and that the vital role they play in this country's history remains as unmistakable as our commitment to their continued well-being. As President Abraham Lincoln said in his Second Inaugural Address: ``Let us care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his or- phan.'' This statement is said to reveal the government's promise to provide life- time health care for our veterans and their families, a promise that many of my colleagues in Congress and I con- tinue fighting to fulfill. Madam Speaker, today I am here to share with my colleagues good news, to tell them of two successful efforts by the government to provide our Nation's veterans with the health care that they need and deserve. Two weeks ago I had the pleasure of attending the dedication of a new com- munity-based outpatient clinic in Jacksonville, North Carolina. For the veterans of Onslow County, this is a tremendous victory and the result of a great deal of work and determination. It has been a priority of mine for some time to find a way to see that a satellite facility was built in eastern North Carolina. For too long, many veterans were forced to travel to Fay- etteville, North Carolina or Durham, North Carolina to reach the closest VA hospital. Madam Speaker, as my colleagues can see, we were in desperate need of health care services that were more ac- cessible to the veterans of easternCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3440 May 20, 1999 North Carolina. The journey was long, but we now have two reasons to cele- brate. The Jacksonville facility marks the second outpatient clinic in eastern North Carolina. It has just been joined by a third. Earlier this week, an addi- tional VA clinic opened in Greenville, North Carolina. They both serve as tributes of the commitment to duty, God, and country that each of our sol- diers accept. Madam Speaker, I am proud of the ef- forts of the Department of Veterans Af- fairs to reach out to veterans across this country, especially considering the drastic cuts they have suffered. Since the end of 1994, the Department of Vet- erans Affairs has cut 20,000 medical care employees, eliminated half of its acute-care hospital beds, and merged many neighboring hospitals. Following such extreme fiscal cutbacks, the Ad- ministration's budget request for Fis- cal Year 2000 was worth little more than the paper it was printed on. Fortunately, I am proud to stand here today to report that a Republican Congress has increased the VA budget $1.7 billion over the President's rec- ommendation. And I only wish that it could be more. Madam Speaker, today I came to the floor to reaffirm my commitment to the men and women who answered their call to duty and protected the freedom my colleagues and I enjoy today. I urge my colleagues to join me in fighting to make sure our Nation's veterans have access to quality, acces- sible health care, a promise made to them by the government they pledged to protect. Again, I want to quote Abraham Lin- coln when he said it, and he said it best: ``Let us care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan.'' Madam Speaker, it is the least we can do to thank our Nation's heroes, our United States veterans. God bless America, and God bless those who have served and those who are serving America today. /fdash /ballot1615 The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Under a previous order ofthe House, the gentleman from Ken- tucky (Mr. W HITFIELD ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, how long must the bombing of Yugoslavia continue? I have asked that question repeatedly on this floor over the last week, and no one seems to have an an- swer. Where is the President leading us? Today, the New York Times, which is generally supportive of the President, contained an article written by Mi- chael Gordon entitled, NATO's Battle Within: Is Leadership Missing? In the article, Mr. Gordon wrote that NATO strategy for bringing the war to a suc- cessful close is starting to unravel. Without clear direction from Wash- ington, Britain, Germany and Italy have begun to promote publicly their separate and conflicting plans. Britain wants ground troops in Kosovo and Yugoslavia. Germany is opposed to ground troops. Italy wants to stop the bombing. In the article, they quoted the former Director of European Af- fairs at the National Security Council who was quoted as saying, there is a lack of direction because no one is leading the way. Mr. President, why do you not lead the way and stop the bombing? Mr. President, Italy today has urged NATO to impose a 48-hour bombing pause to pursue a diplomatic settlement. I urge you to stop the bombing. Just last night, NATO launched its strongest air attack in 2 weeks against the Belgrade area. Our bombs hit a hos- pital and at least three civilians were killed. Furthermore, an operating room was demolished, an intensive care unit was leveled, and rescuers were evacuating women and children from the maternity ward, just last night in Belgrade, because of our bombings. In addition, the Swedish ambassador's residence was damaged when an explod- ing bomb blew out windows and a door. Mr. President, your policy is not working. Not only are we losing the support of our allies but bombing has exacerbated the refugee problem among the Kosovar Albanians and now, because of the bombings, the Serbian people themselves. From a policy point, it is difficult to imagine how the situation could be much worse. Our bombs have killed innocent people, de- stroyed hospitals, leveled the embassy of China, damaged the infrastructure, and now even damaged the residence of the Swedish ambassador to Yugoslavia. The incessant bombing has trans- formed what was a Balkan crisis into a worldwide crisis. In fact, the New York Times Sunday reported how dem- onstrations are erupting all over the world against the bombing. So I would say to the President, what do you want? The Yugoslavian govern- ment is beginning to remove forces from Kosovo. They have expressed a willingness to negotiate. How many more bombs must be dropped? How many more deaths must occur before you stop this failed policy and give di- plomacy an opportunity to work?ON H.R. 644, PRESCRIPTION DRUG FAIRNESS FOR SENIORS ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentle- woman from California (Ms. W OOLSEY ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to put an end to a national dis- grace. Plainly speaking, I am talking about price gouging, price gouging some of the most vulnerable members of our community, our seniors. Americans widely support programs to ensure the health and welfare of older Americans. We have Social Secu- rity, we have Medicare, as well as hous- ing programs, nutrition programs and programs that really protect our low- income seniors. Seniors today have less fear of being taken advantage of be- cause of consumer laws and senior abuse laws that protect them. But there is one area where we clearly have failed, and that is to ensure that pre- scription drugs are affordable, afford- able to the people who need them the most, our seniors. The latest surveys indicate that 86 percent of Medicare beneficiaries take prescription drugs and that the elderly in the United States, who make up only 12 percent of our population, use one-third of the prescription drugs sold in this Nation. The need for prescrip- tion drugs to treat such diseases as ar- thritis, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, is simply a fact of life for seniors, or a fact of death. A few years ago, a survey of seniors reported that 13 percent of older Americans had to choose between eating or buying medicine. In Sonoma and Marin Counties, the district I represent, the two counties north of the Golden Gate bridge, two individuals that I have come to know, Roy and Ivera Cobbs of Sebastopol, have had to make some very difficult decisions around their prescription drugs. What they decided was, she would take her prescription drugs and he would not because they could not af- ford both. That is not the way we are supposed to be treating our seniors. Also in Sonoma and Marin County, the area Agencies on Aging and Green Thumb have told me some other sto- ries. They tell me about cases where seniors just do not buy food because they have to have prescription drugs, or they take part of their prescription every other day instead of every day or once a day instead of twice a day, as prescribed by their doctors, because they cannot afford to pay for the whole dosage. And for the reason some sen- iors cannot pay for them keeps our sen- iors from having the best health care they can. This reason, I believe, is sole- ly on the shoulders of the Nation's largest drug companies, because they engage in discriminatory pricing. If you are a favored customer, like an HMO, like a large insurance company, you pay less, much less for prescription drugs. But if you are an older person, on Medicare, you pay a premium price for your drugs.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3441 May 20, 1999 In the district I represent, Sonoma County seniors pay on the average of 145 percent more for the most com- monly used drugs than favored cus- tomers pay for the same drugs. For one drug, they pay 242 percent more than favored customers. I know this, be- cause I asked the minority staff of the Committee on Government Reform to look into prescription drug pricing in Sonoma and Marin Counties. I released the results to that report to my com- munity and its central conclusion can be summed up in the report subtitle, Drug Companies Profit at the Expense of Older Americans. As Members can see by these charts, for Sonoma County alone, the study looked into five com- monly used prescription drugs, charted their price at local pharmacies and compared those prices to what the Fed- eral Government pays for the same drugs. The Federal negotiated price is nearly the same, you must know, as that charged to favored private cus- tomers, large insurance companies and HMOs. Senior citizens and other indi- viduals who pay for their own drugs pay more than twice as much for these drugs than do the drug companies' most favored customers. For some drugs listed in the report, the price is even more outrageous. Synthroid, for example, a hormone treatment, costs Sonoma County seniors 1,738 percent more than it cost the manufacturer's favored customers. By looking at these charts, we can see that for Medicare patients, those who need the choles- terol drug Zocor, their costs are sig- nificantly greater than the favored cus- tomers. This comes out to $115 for Medicare patients and $34 for the fa- vored customers. That is 231 percent different. The difference is not in price because the HMOs, the large insurance companies and government buyers are able to negotiate and buy in bulk. The difference is because they are charging seniors to make up the difference for what they cut for their most favored customers. /fdash INTRODUCING LEGISLATION TO HELP AMERICA'S FARMERS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen- tleman from Washington (Mr. NETHERCUTT ) is recognized for 5 min- utes. Mr. NETHERCUTT. Madam Speaker, American agriculture today and rural communities today face an extraor- dinary challenge, the challenge of hav- ing farm policy change in 1996 with the consent and approval of this Congress and the consent and approval of the President of the United States for the good, to have an opportunity to have less farming for the government and more farming for the market. Overall, combined with the freedom that this new agriculture policy provides and the additional expenditure of taxpayer dol- lars for agriculture research with the movement toward reduction of Federal regulations that hampered the farmer'sfreedom to do what the farmer does best, and that is farm for the market and other changes that were made in the 1996 farm bill, it has overall been a good thing. What the American farmer faces today is low prices and lack of markets. Our farmers do not have the ability to market overseas the prod- ucts that we grow so well in this coun- try. My State of Washington is a perfect example, and the Fifth Congressional District is a more narrow example of a perfect example. That is, our farmers in the Fifth District grow wheat and barley and oats and peas and lentils and potatoes and apples, the best in the world. But yet most of our products, on our grain products and commodities, are exported overseas. My farmers are limited in those exports because of uni- lateral American sanctions on coun- tries that used to be wonderful trading partners of Washington State farmers and agriculture in the West. I have introduced legislation, H.R. 212, earlier in this Congress as a pri- ority matter for not only the farmers of the Pacific Northwest but the farm- ers of the country. What that bill does is lift the unilateral sanctions that are currently in place by our government that prevent our farmers from selling to countries that other farmers around the world can sell to. We used to have a fine market in wheat sales to Iran and Iraq and the Sudan and other places that are currently sanctioned. The sanctions are imposed because of our disagreements with the terrorist policies and the enemy policies of these governments. I disagree with those policies of those rogue nations that have used terror in the world and oppression in the world. But yet selling agriculture and medi- cine to those countries does not in my judgment pose a national security threat on our country. What it does as we unilaterally impose those sanctions is hurt our farmers. So H.R. 212 does two things. It lifts the sanctions that are currently in place for food and medicine only, and it gives the Presi- dent the opportunity in the event that the President feels that lifting those sanctions poses a national security threat, the President has the ability to reimpose those sanctions on that basis. But in the meantime, it allows our farmers, then, to seek to reclaim those markets that we have lost by virtue of the sanctions. In 1980, President Carter imposed a sanction on the Soviet Union for polit- ical purposes. Who did that hurt? It hurt the Olympics, and the American interest in the Olympics, and it hurt American farmers, a market that was a prime market for my farmers in the West. We have yet to get that agri- culture market back by virtue of those sanctions back in 1980. /ballot1630 Yesterday in the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and RelatedAgencies on which I serve as a sub- committee member I introduced a nar- rower version of H.R. 212 which would lift of the sanctions on food and medi- cine for these countries that are cur- rently sanctioned, but it would not allow any government spending in con- nection with the lifting of those sanc- tions. In other words, the taxpayer would not bear any of the burden for allowing our farmers to deal directly with those countries and make sales. It is a $6 billion plus market for our farm- ers in commodities as diverse as rice and corn and peas and wheat and bar- ley. It is a great market that is ex- posed to our farmers. Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, my friends on the appropriations sub- committee defeated this amendment by a vote of 28 to 24. It was a very close vote, but it was a great debate, and we ought to have that debate again on H.R. 212 and on this next version of this amendment that went into the appro- priation bill yesterday. So, I urge my colleagues to study H.R. 212, study the concept of lifting sanctions on food and medicine. It is a humanitarian basis that is good policy for our country, and it will absolutely help our agriculture markets who are struggling to find markets overseas. One final point: In the event that we lift these sanctions and allow farmer- to-country correspondence and sales, it prevents the agriculture community that is in straits from coming to the Congress and seeking Federal tax dol- lars. It is the free market approach to agriculture success. /fdash INTRODUCTION OF THE BROAD- CASTERS FAIRNESS IN ADVER- TISING ACT OF 1999 The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. EMERSON ). Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. R USH) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. RUSH. Madam Speaker, today I am here to introduce the Broadcasters Fairness in Advertising Act of 1999. There is a silent and pervasive trend among ad agencies and the companies they represent to engage in discrimina- tory practices which are called, quote, ``no urban/Spanish dictates'' end of quote, and they are called, quote, ``mi- nority discounts,'' end of quote. The term: ``No urban slash Spanish dic- tates'' means not advertising products on stations that cater to minorities. ``Minority discounts'' means paying minority-owned stations far less for ad- vertising the same product that is paid to nonminority-owned stations. These policies have no business rationale and are purely discriminatory. Madam Speaker, year in and year out minority broadcasters lose millions of dollars in revenues, however the adver- tising companies would have us believe otherwise. They will contend that they do not advertise in these stations be- cause minorities do not buy their prod- ucts.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3442 May 20, 1999 For example, in a study conducted by the FCC, a major mayonnaise manufac- turer told a station manager that, quote, black people do not eat may- onnaise, end of quote. Or worse, one minority station salesperson was told that, and I quote again, black people do not eat beef, end of quote. Such a bla- tantly absurd statement demonstrates the openly racist obstacles minority broadcasters face from the advertising industry. My bill will prohibit discrimination against minority formatted stations by directing the FCC to adopt regulations to prevent such discrimination. It would also allow private right of action by any minority broadcaster who has been subjected to advertising discrimi- nation. And finally, my bill will pro- hibit Federal agencies from con- tracting with ad agencies that utilize these discriminatory practices. Madam Speaker, I sincerely hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in supporting this very, very important initiative. /fdash ON THE OCCASION OF THE INAU- GURATION OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS OF KURDISTAN The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen- tleman from California (Mr. F ILNER ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. FILNER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak about democracy, a form of government which was in- vented in the 5th century B.C. by the Greeks in Athens, great city of Athens. The British honor democracy through their parliament, the Japanese have their Diet, the Duma serves the Rus- sians, and of course here in the United States democracy is exercised right here on the floor of Congress. Democ- racy still remains the best hope for troubled humanity throughout the world. With the end of the Cold War, Madam Speaker, we have seen a great expan- sion of the boundaries of democracy. The world is a better place today be- cause many former Soviet republics now enjoy self determination and are given their rightful seats in the Hall of Nations. But auspicious as has been the forward march of liberty, the world re- mains far from being free. Nations re- main in captivity. The color of one's skin still bars some from feeling our common humanity. But the hope that we can rise to the challenge of total equality is enduring. People of good- will are risking their lives against great odds. They know the rewards are worth the risks. Madam Speaker, on May 24, 1999, just a few days from now, a nation whose voice has been silenced for too long will convene its first congress, unfortu- nately not in its own land but in Brus- sels, Belgium, and 150 delegates from around the world representing the Kurdish people of Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran and the former Soviet republics will assemble for the purpose of raisingtheir voice for their brothers and sis- ters who are denied a voice in Kurdistan. I salute the birth of this congress that represents a people as old as the dawn of history. Madam Speaker, the Kurds are na- tives of the Middle East who inhabit a mountainous region as large as the State of Texas. They speak Kurdish, which is distinct from Turkish and Ar- abic but is closely linked with Persian. Having survived in mountain strong- holds and ancient empires, they are now persecuted, denied their identity and forced to become Turks or Arabs or Persian by the states that were born in the early 20th century. Thirty million strong, they are viewed as beasts of burden or as cannon fodder, but never as Kurds who should enjoy human rights that we take for granted in this country. It is a crime to be a Kurd in Turkey, Madam Speaker. Saddam Hussein has used chemical and biological weapons against them in Iraq. The theocracy in Tehran often machine guns the Kurd- ish dissidents in the city squares. The poignancy of the Kurdish situation hits closer to home when we realize that our own government is sometimes in- volved in their misery. Turkey boosts of American F\u00b116 fighter planes, Sikor- sky attack helicopters and M\u00b160 battle tanks. Saddam Hussein, according to some declassified U.N. documents, had the support of 24 European companies to produce his deadly chemical fumes and biological fumes. Tehran's opposi- tion to the Kurds has gone beyond Iran with the assassination of Kurdish lead- ers in Vienna and Berlin. We all revere the words of Thomas Jefferson when he wrote in the Dec- laration of Independence: ``When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them with another, and to assume among the Powers of the earth the sep- arate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God en- title them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.'' Madam Speaker, given the lot of the Kurds, it is more than understandable that they set up their own Congress and take charge of their own destiny. They have the people, the resources and the political understanding to suc- ceed in their dream of statehood. Madam Speaker, I need also at this time to address the situation of Abdullah Ocalan, the Kurdish leader who, according to a recent New York Times article, was handed over to the Turks with the help of our intelligence services. As you may recall, he had ventured to Europe from his home base in the Middle East to seek a political solution to the enduring Kurdish strug- gle for basic human rights. I spoke on this floor welcoming his declaration of cease-fire and hoped, it now seems against hope, to see the debate on the Kurdish question change from war topeace and from confrontation to dia- logue. Mr. Ocalan, denied a refuge in Rome, was promised the safe passage through Greece to the Hague where he intended to sue the Government of Turkey at the International Court of Justice for its crimes against the Kurds. But the laws of granting asylum to political figures, as old as the time of prophets, were suspended in this case. Abdullah Ocalan, the most popular Kurdish fig- ure of the day, was arrested. Through a deal that smacks of political venality at its worst, he was handed over to the Turks and now awaits his most likely execution as the sole inmate in the Imrali Island prison in the Sea of Marmara. Madam Speaker, it is unbecoming of this great power to aid and abet dicta- torships which are merely disguised as democracies. Those who imprison duly elected representatives such as Layla Zana in Turkey for testifying before a standing committee of this Congress cannot and should not enjoy our sup- port. Leaders such as Abdullah Ocalan, despite his violent past, still hold the promise of peace and reconciliation for the Kurds with their neighbors. The eu- phoria that we all felt for the freedom of captive nations in the former Soviet Union now must extend to our allies and their subjects as well. So we welcome the convening of the National Congress of Kurdistan. They are dreaming what to many may seem an impossible dream, the dream of a united Kurdish people in the Nation of Kurdistan. /fdash TAIWAN CONGRATULATIONS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentle- woman from Florida (Ms. B ROWN ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Madam Speaker, 3 years ago President Lee won a landslide victory in the first presi- dential election in the history of China. As a democratic elected presi- dent, he demonstrated to the world that democracy could indeed thrive in Taiwan. During the last 3 years Presi- dent Lee continued to implement his program for the Republic of China. As a result, Taiwan presently has free elections in every level of government, a free press, and holds respect for human rights in the highest regard. As a believer in increasing coopera- tion between Taiwan and mainland China, President Lee continued to em- phasize that it is necessary for Taiwan and the mainland to work together to conduct further discussions on the issue of reunification. Many close to the president maintain that his one true dream is to witness a unified China under the principle of democracy rules, free enterprise and the distribu- tion of wealth. A few years ago I had the privilege of being President Lee's guest on a visit to Taiwan. Since that time I perceive him as a world class statesman andCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3443 May 20, 1999 hope that he will be able to influence mainland China to democratize and re- unify with Taiwan on the basis of democratic principles. As a faithful friend of the United States, we must give him our wholehearted support as his presence on the island is symbolic of the economy and a politically stable Asia. /fdash GUNS AND CHILDREN\u00d0THEY DO NOT MIX The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentle- woman from Texas (Ms. J ACKSON -LEE) is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. Madam Speaker, I thought it was important to come to the floor of the House to ad- dress again the crisis that we are fac- ing in this Nation, and that crisis is that of the safety of our children. Today unfortunately as the sun rose another youngster took weapons to school and shot children. I am most grateful, as most mothers and fathers, families, that this tragedy did not re- sult in death. I cannot imagine what people in Littleton, Colorado, are thinking, or Jonesboro, or the State of Pennsylvania, or my own State of Texas, and rather than be political and politicize this, I am simply begging with all of the intellect in this Con- gress that we have the courage to admit that there are many concerns. /ballot1645 There is the entertainment industry, violence in videos. There is the issue of intergenerational conflict or dis- connect because maybe adults and chil- dren are not talking the way they should. There is the concern that I have raised and will be presenting in legisla- tion, Give a Child a Chance Omnibus Mental Health Services bill for 1999 where we can focus on the fact that children need mental health services, both children who can afford it and those who cannot. I think right now, in light of the Sen- ate's actions today, we realize that gun legislation is not political. Over 89 per- cent of the American public are waking up and saying we must have safety locks. It is important to keep from children, or young people under 21, guns. We must close the loopholes in pawn shops and in gun shows so that there are no more opportunities for people to randomly walk in and get guns, as a young lady did on behalf of Eric Harris in Littleton, Colorado. Parents are in pain. Children are in fear. Our children can talk about guns and their feeling of being unsafe. They can talk about the fact that they do not know whether their graduation will be safe or whether large gatherings will be safe. Many of us as women Members of Congress have gathered. We gathered before Mother's Day and asked Speaker HASTERT to ensure that we pass gun legislation before Father's Day. I wantto go a step further. We have next week. We should not leave here until we say not only to the American people but the world that we pride ourselves, as loving our children greater than our guns, and in fact this is not taking away guns from people who use them for sports and legally. This is saying that we have a proliferation of guns and our children are asking or crying out for us to be restrained and to re- strain them; 250 million Americans, 260 million guns on the street. Why cannot we find common ground on legislation that I passed in my city holding parents responsible, adults, for allowing guns to be in children's hands and thereby causing an injury? It was unanimously supported and then passed in the State of Texas, certainly a State that has its share of guns. Safety locks, as has been said elo- quently by my colleagues, there are regulations of diaper bags and regula- tions of parks and schools and equip- ment that children use. Why not guns? Why can we not keep guns out of the hands of those under 21? Why can we not do instant check at gun shows where all kinds of people come and, be- lieve me, they use that method to get guns. Why can we not have tracing so that felons who are now dealing with the black market can be found? Why can we not have an amendment that deals with gun running? It is very important, Madam Speak- er, that the women in this House stand up. I demand that we collectively raise our voices to the Speaker, and I guess I demand of him, to not shy away from the responsibility. Put the NRA aside. It has its own agenda, and anyone who says it does not is not reading all of their PR, their public relations. I did not come here to point the finger. I have mentioned the entertainment industry. They know what they can do. This is a pyramid. We are building blocks. I have mentioned the need for more mental health services from K to 12, intervention risk assessment in every piece of legislation, that I can. In addition to the omnibus bill, I am going to be raising my voice for mental health services. It is too long and too late where it is a stigma, so that is why children have stopped taking their medication because there is a stigma all around. So if the parent does not tell them they certainly do not get re- inforced in school, and troubled chil- dren are in our schools without medi- cation. So, Madam Speaker, I am not point- ing the finger. I am speaking out of an- guish and I am speaking out of pain. I cannot go another day without us doing something about these guns. We must pass legislation this week as we come back. While I am home in the district this weekend, whoever will hear me, I will be talking about are we going to stand up for our children? Tomorrow at a press conference on Head Start I will be talking about our children and guns.Madam Speaker, I hope that we can collectively indicate to the American people we have heard them. This is a crisis and we know their pain. The Federal Government does not want to take over education of their children. We just want to take over the fact that we want our children to sur- vive and we are going to help them with legislation and money. Madam Speaker, I hope that we will all stand together next week as we re- turn to this Congress. /fdash MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE A message from the Senate by Mr. Lundregan, one of its clerks, an- nounced that the Senate agrees to the report of the committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the amendment of the Sen- ate to the bill (H.R. 1141) ``An Act mak- ing emergency supplemental appropria- tions for the fiscal year ending Sep- tember 30, 1999, and for other pur- poses.''

Under the Speaker's an- nounced policy of January 6, 1999, the gentleman from California (Mr. CUNNINGHAM ) is recognized for 60 min- utes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker, I come tonight to give maybe a little different perspective on the war in Kosovo than most people have seen from the spin from NATO and the White House. I would like to give some information that has not been widely disseminated but I think is important before any solution in the Balkans is possible. First of all, Rambouillet, which was an attempt at an agreement which was not an agreement, to bring the Muslim and Serbian Yugoslavs together. Let me go back first with Rambouillet and explain where Rambouillet was a very failed foreign policy effort. I use the quotes of both Larry Eagleburger and Henry Kissinger inCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3444 May 20, 1999 saying that Rambouillet was a failed foreign policy from the start. Look at history, and I met with the Reverend Jesse Jackson, who I disagree with probably more than I agree, but one thing I respected about Reverend Jackson was not necessarily that he brought our prisoners back, that was good, but his ability to place himself in the shoes of either side of an argument. Even if he disagrees with one side or another, he understands that before someone can ever have a solution that they have to understand the feelings and what is in the mind and the heart of both sides, or there is no choice whatsoever. Part of that understanding is the his- tory of greater Yugoslavia. On April 5, 1941, just last month the anniversary, Germany bombed Belgrade. They put over 700,000 Nazis into Kosovo in the area. The Nazis were supported by a half a million Croatians, and about a quarter of that number of Muslims. One in three Serbs died in Kosovo fighting the Nazis, the Croatians and the Muslims. The civilians in Kosovo had to flee across the Danube River for their lives, while the forces under a General Miholevic, not Milosevic but Miholevic, supported both the par- tisans and the loyalists. The Chetniks were more of a guerilla warfare. In the three-year period of over a million Nazis, the Chetniks, the par- tisans and the loyalists either killed or pushed out every Croatian, Muslim and Nazi out of Kosovo. In 1387, the Serbs celebrate still Kosovo and the founding of their Or- thodox Catholic church at 1,600 dif- ferent churches and shrines. So Rambouillet, I would ask after that kind of history, would a person if they were in any of the United States, if they were in Texas, if they were in California and say Mexico populated ei- ther one of those States by 90 percent and all of a sudden they wanted Cali- fornia or Texas to go to Mexico, does anyone think the United States would allow that to happen? I do not, abso- lutely. The second part of Rambouillet said that, oh, by the way, you cannot have any of your police force in Kosovo; that even though Kosovo is part of greater Serbia or Yugoslavia, none of your laws apply; only the laws of the major- ity which are the Albanians, and in 3 years there will be a vote as to whether Albania remains part of Serbia. Not Milosevic but the Serbian people, and the understanding of what Kosovo means to the Serbs, was a great, great failure of this administration and the President to recognize. Either the President recognized it and wanted us to go to war or he did not recognize the importance of Kosovo to the Serbian people. Either way, it is why we are at the position we are today. To say that diplomatic efforts were exhausted is far from the truth, and there are still ways for us to get out of this particular nightmare.I fought in Vietnam. I spent 20 years of my life in the military as a senior commander, responsible both for a Navy fighter weapons top gun and at Naval staff on the planning, the inva- sion of Southeast Asia and European countries, and my friends from the Pentagon have told me that they told the President not to conduct air strikes into Kosovo. Why? They said, first of all, air strikes alone would not achieve a sin- gle goal that the President wanted. Secondly, that every one of the prob- lems that existed then would be exacer- bated, would be increased. They told the President that it is highly probable and most likely that the Serb forces would force evacuation of Albanians, since that had been, in their eyes, a big problem over the last two decades. Madam Speaker, take a look at the children's eyes that are refugees today, a million refugees walking through the snow. I have two daughters and I looked as if my own daughters had to go through this, and we need to thank God every day that we live in a coun- try where that does not happen. In my view, there are two people that have caused that mass evacuation and forced the refugees. One is Milosevic and the other is the President of the United States by forcing the bombing. Most people do not realize the hysteria: This is another Nazi, this is another Holocaust. Most people do not realize the total number, the total number of people killed in Kosovo in a 1-year period prior to the United States and NATO bombing was 2,012 people killed. We kill more people than that in New York City and Washington, D.C. every year. Now, each individual is im- portant, but it is also important to re- alize that one-third of those 2,000 peo- ple were Serbs that were killed by the KLA. Did they have a fight? Yes. Were there atrocities? Yes, on both sides. Until one puts themselves in the shoes of either side and both sides in the eyes of what is important to them, what are their fears? The Serbs fear the Ger- mans. They did not want NATO troops with Germans in there. They fear that Kosovo will be taken away from them, much like if California or Texas was taken away from the United States. The Albanians want some kind of participation in the government. They have about 90 percent of the popu- lation, but most people do not realize 60 percent of that 90 percent of the Al- banians are there illegally. They are not citizens of Kosovo. They have come across the border from Albania ille- gally. /ballot1700 And that, in itself, is a problem. Listen to the briefs. Watch the tele- vision, Madam Speaker, and listen to the Albanians talk about how they were forced out of their homes by the Serbs. Were they forced prior? No. There are 300,000 Albanians that live in Belgrade and not a single one has leftbecause they live there peacefully. They live there peacefully together. But listen to the debriefs from Kosovo. They were forced out of their homes. They were not fleeing prior to the bombing, but like the military told the President, upon NATO's strikes, the Serbs started forcing the Albanians out of Kosovo. They knew that the KLA on the ground was a threat to them. Is it right? No, I am not saying it is right, but I am saying we have to look at the total picture. Well, Mr. President, if you are trying to change your legacy with a war or be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, one is not nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by killing more civilians in these strikes than the Serbs killed in the one-year period prior. One does not get nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for forcing millions of people to evacuate and then claiming it is a Hol- ocaust, which it was not. I spoke to General Clark face-to-face in Brussels a month ago, and I asked General Clark, I said, how many of the sorties, how many of the flights is the United States participating in? There are 19 nations in NATO, 18 other na- tions. The United States, part of NATO in a European problem, is flying 75 per- cent of the strike missions. The United States, 75 percent. Tony Blair gets up and says, put in ground troops, put in ground troops. He only has 18 airplanes in Kosovo in those strikes, but yet he beats on his chest and says put in ground troops. Madam Speaker, 75 percent of the strikes does not include the B\u00b12 strikes out of the United States; it does not in- clude the C\u00b117s, it does not include the tanking and the logistics flights, which puts the United States' flights in Kosovo at over 86 percent, Madam Speaker. Ninety percent of the weap- ons dropped are from the United States, and yet there are 18 nations, other nations in this. I asked General Clark, I said, well, why are we flying all of these missions? He said, Duke, most of the NATO na- tions do not have these stand-off weap- ons. They do not have these stand-off weapons, and the weather is bad. You think they might have checked the weather to know that there was a two- week forecasted bad weather over Kosovo before they ever started air strikes. No, they did not. Ninety percent of the weapons. Our next supplemental should be a check from those nations. If they cannot fly the strikes, if they cannot support NATO, if they cannot supply the ord- nance, then they ought to be at least burden-sharing and paying the United States for it. This ad hoc war, ground troops, in all of the tactical experience that I had in the military, working with all services and most of our friendly allies, not once would I ever tell an enemy that I was not going to use a certain type of force like ground troops. It is lunacy. It is idiotic in a tactical environment to tell your enemy that you want toCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3445 May 20, 1999 change his heart and mind, but you are only going to use air strikes, to allow him to focus on one phase and not have to prepare for ground troops, not have to station his troops and deploy his weapons. Do my colleagues think that the President might have told Russia, Chernomyrdin, knowing how Russia feels, do you think they might have told the Russians that they were going to bomb Kosovo when Chernomyrdin was on his way to the United States and actually turned his airplane around and went back? Is that accept- able foreign policy? I do not think so. This ad hoc war. People said well, Duke, how can they possibly look at a map and bomb an embassy like Chi- na's? Well, when one is doing some- thing so fast, so ad hoc, and one rips maps off without any prior planning, it is very easy to see. When one is scram- bling to find targets, when one is scrambling because one's missions are not being successful, then it is easy. And they took the wrong map. Even today, they hit two other embassies and they hit a hospital, killing hun- dreds of civilians. Again I say, the United States and NATO has killed more civilians in Kosovo than the Serbs killed in the entire year prior to the bombing. And that is wrong. Madam Speaker, if one comes from the 1970s and one was a left-wing antiwar protestor or belonged to a pro- test group, and one is in leadership and one attempts to use a vehicle like the military that one neither understands or supports and even loathes, most of one's decisions, in my opinion, are going to be inept, they are going to be incorrect, because one does not have the gut feelings of what it should take. A classic example of that was in Vietnam with the President we had then that controlled every single strike, and that was Lyndon Johnson. I lost a lot of my close friends in air-to- air. I was shot down on May 10, 1972 over North Vietnam, and many of my friends died because of inept decisions by a left-wing person that neither ac- cepted, supported or understood the military. When the President, knowing that he has surrounded himself with the Tony Lakes, with the Ira Magaziners, with the Strobe Talbotts, and he disavows, does not accept the advice of the mili- tary warfighters, that is even more of a problem, and it has been disastrous. We had a briefing from a source which I am not allowed to say, but it is a very important governmental source, and the KLA is supported by the Mujahedin and Hamas from Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan. Are they in large numbers? Are they entire armies? No. But they have evidence of those indi- viduals infiltrating the KLA units. I will say that if I was an Albanian citizen and put myself in their shoes, I would be a member of the KLA, fight- ing for what I believed in. But on the other hand, if I was a Serb, I would be a Serbian soldier fighting for what I be-lieved in. And until the President rec- ognizes that, there is no solution. The Mujahedin and Hamas have a small in- fluence, but it is there and it has to be removed. They said, is it likely Osama bin Laden, like the Washington Times re- ported, has influenced and is sup- porting the KLA? Well, I will let my colleagues draw the inference. Osama bin Laden has organizations in over 150 areas, and everywhere there is a Mus- lim issue, he is involved. They said there is no direct evidence, but it is likely. It was also reported in all of the Eu- ropean press and the United States in The New York Times that the number one heroin dealer, the number one her- oin dealers were the Albanian Kosovars. And yes, the source said that that money is going in to support the KLA. They will take money from any- body they can. They consider it their survival. General Clark, when I was in Brus- sels, I looked at him and besides asking him how many sorties were flying, he said, Duke, at the beginning of this NATO only wanted to fly one day and quit, because of all of these other things. They did not have their hearts and minds into this. General Clark said the President called Tony Blair from England, the German Chancellor, and they pushed this, that it is a must, it is a must. What that agenda is I do not know. All I know is that this ad hoc war has been disastrous not only for the American people, but for the Alba- nians and for the Serbs. Madam Speaker, I think it is im- proper to say that all Germans were Nazis in World War II. There were a lot of innocent people. A lot of people did not support the Nazis. There are a lot of people that are not Mujahedin and Hamas, that are fighting for their lives, and if we look into the eyes of those children, we should have as much sympathy for those children and the innocent civilians on the Albanian side and the Serb side of the innocent peo- ple that are being killed because of war. That is important also. Madam Speaker, I remember Mad- eleine Albright saying that if we al- lowed Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hun- gary into NATO, the United States would not have to participate in any European war. Well, guess what? They are all three part of NATO. And during the conflict Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary would not even let us fly over their airspace, and it took some serious arm-twisting by Madeleine Albright and others, the President, to use their airspace or even their bases and deploy. They had a NATO summit here, anni- versary, and the President says that all NATO is speaking with one voice. Well, Mr. President, if that is true, why is Hungary, why is France, why is Greece, why is Russia still shipping oil to Serbs in the greater Yugoslavia? They are not speaking with one voice, and the spin that NATO and the White Houseplaces on this is atrocious, in my opin- ion. Take a look, Madam Speaker, at what NATO is today. We no longer have Ronald Reagan or Margaret Thatcher types. I ask my colleagues to look at the Germans. It is a green so- cialist government. Look at France. France has a socialist, communist coa- lition in their government. They threw out the conservatives. If we look at England with Tony Blair, labor left. Israel just yesterday, labor left. Ger- many, as I mentioned. Italy, Com- munist. So NATO is made up today of not Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, but people that are socialist and Com- munist and left. And it is difficult to make decisions using the military when those individuals historically have fought against the military itself. Another little-known fact, Madam Speaker, briefed again by a source, the same source as I quoted a minute ago, said 70 percent of the Russian military support the overthrow of the Yeltsin government. We have seen just this week and last week an attempt of an impeachment of President Yeltsin. Seventy percent of the Russian mili- tary who support their leadership are the hard-line communists that support Milosevic. They want us to go in with ground troops. It would give them the catalyst that they need to return the former Soviet Union back to com- munism. And it is a very difficult prob- lem. Look at Greece. Greece has ties to the Serbs because when the Serbs kicked out the 1 million Nazis, look at Thessalonica in northern Greece, where millions of Greeks and Jews and Serbs were annihilated by the Nazis, and Greece with its orthodox church, along with the Serbian orthodox church and their tie-in with World War II, makes them an ally. And look at what we have done with China and Russia and Greece, people that we have been working with through trade with China, through try- ing to start a democracy going and light the fires of a young democracy in Russia, and even working with the Greeks has been disastrous foreign pol- icy for the United States. /ballot1715 All of this, and they say, D UKE, you are a hawk. I am not a hawk, Madam Speaker. I am a dove, but I like to be a well-armed dove. And those that have fought in war and held, like in Private Ryan, held our friends and watched them die, maybe we are a little more reluctant to get our people involved in a conflict to where we know there is going to be a lot of loss of human life, and where we also know that diplo- macy would work. The President talks about wanting to save social security with a surplus, to save Medicare with a surplus, edu- cation from the surplus. I would like to see medical research, because it is ex- citing, what NIH is doing today as farCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3446 May 20, 1999 as the cure and the elimination of dis- ease. We would like to double that. I was in a group yesterday that wants to increase prostate cancer research by $100 million total. Madam Speaker, we cannot do that by spending $50 billion in Kosovo. We spent $16 billion thus far in Bosnia and we are only supposed to be there 1 year, $16 billion. Do Members know that we still spend $25 million a year building roads in Haiti? And Haiti had no national secu- rity to the United States. The exten- sion of Somalia, which most of us op- posed, we got 22 Rangers killed and we got our butts kicked out of there. We had to run out of Somalia. Every time the President had a per- sonal political tragedy, we went into Iraq four different times. Let us not forget the hasty decision to go into the Sudan and bomb an aspirin factory. They just asked for $45 million to pay back the Sudanese, and the President said, okay, $45 million. Who is respon- sible? Has anybody been held account- able? Absolutely not. Let me tell the Members, besides taking up the surplus, our military today, we are retaining only about 23 percent of our military, of our enlisted. We are retaining only about 33 percent of our aviators, our pilots. Why? When I talk to these young men and young women who are flying and the people who are servicing those aircraft and that equipment, they say, Duke, I am away from my family 8 months out of a year. I am worried about my fam- ily, because their benefits are eroding. Our equipment is 1970s technology. I had a briefing last Friday from a very classified source, which I will not go into, but there is an asset that Rus- sia has in the air that if our pilots would engage it, we lose the dogfight and the intercept 90 percent of the time because we have shut down our re- search and development and we have not been able to compete. I am alive today, and the airplanes I shot down in Vietnam, because I had better equipment and better training. Today our troops are getting less train- ing, and the equipment is 1970s tech- nology. Fortunately, this asset has not been deployed to Kosovo, but it is to North Korea, it is to many of our other potential enemies in this world. That is scary. Our ships are going out with thou- sands of sailors short. We are $3 billion short in ship repair for our military ships. I could go on and on. Madam Speaker, they say, Duke, you have told us all the problems, but what would you do if you were president? And no, I am not running for the presi- dency, Madam Speaker. My daughter would like me to because then she could have two dogs, but I do not plan ever on running for the presidency. I have my hands full right here. Let me give some ideas. I stated from the day that we went in to Kosovo, and I would start it off first, Madam Speak- er, by saying, some of the people can remember a movie called the JazzSinger. I am old enough to remember Al Jolson playing in that part. Later on Neal Diamond played in the movie Al Jolson. The whole movie is based on a Jewish proverb. It is about a jazz singer, a gen- tleman that is the son of a cantor, and the father wants his son to be a Jewish cantor. The son, of course, wants to be a jazz singer. There is so much hurt by the father that he rips his jacket in the Jewish fashion and denies that he has a son, and there is great consternation between the two. The father, after a while, is so dis- traught at losing his son, not to death but from an argument, and the Jewish proverb goes like this. The father cries out, and I have two daughters, so I think you can do the same with a daughter, but he says, son, come home. We have argued too long. And the son replies, father, I cannot, because there is too much between us. And the father replies, son, come as far as you can, and I will come the rest of the way. Sometimes that bridge is too far. If you do not understand and put yourself in the shoes, like Jesse Jackson did, and understand, even though you may disagree with the perceptions of an in- dividual group, you still have to under- stand that before you can ever come the rest of the way. The President of the United States has not recognized that. So I think that is the first step into any diplo- macy. First of all, we have to halt the strikes, leave our force in place in case it does not work. Let us, instead of having the Rus- sians as a problem and a threat, and maybe even going back to communism, let us help the Russians. Let us let them be part of the solution, not only in Kosovo but in their own political world back in Russia. Let us have Rus- sian and Greek and Scandinavian and Italian troops go in and act as the peacekeepers. Again, we have to recognize, the Serbs fear the Germans, they fear the United States, and they fear Great Britain. We have become an enemy to a once ally. Let us let them be the solu- tion. The Greeks the same way. They have supported the Serbs. Let us let them be part of the solution. Milosevic must withdraw his armor prior to Rambouillet, but we have to have a different kind of Rambouillet, one that is achievable and realistic, with options and realistic and achiev- able goals, unlike Rambouillet I. There is going to have to be an inter- national body, Madam Speaker. There are nearly 1 million Albanians that have been thrust out of their homes. A large portion of those are illegal. They are not citizens of Kosovo. But the Serbs have caused part of their own problem by tearing up many of those papers that identify who is a citizen and who is not a citizen. It is going to take an international body to repa- triate the Albanians. When I was 15 years old I worked on a farm in Shelbina, Missouri, popu-lation 2,113 folks. Rather than work for my dad, who was a store owner, I would go out in the hayfields and put up hay. Well, there was a lady named Ms. Featherall that always took care of the young boys and fed us probably 10 times the amount that we needed. And during the noon hour, we sat on a rock- ing chair up on her porch to get cool. She was afraid we would work too hard, and we loved that lady. A Siamese cat came around the cor- ner and jumped up in my lap. I petted that cat, Madam Speaker. A few min- utes later around the corner came a Persian cat, a barn cat. I picked up the Persian cat, and immediately the two cats tensed and they started hissing, as you can imagine. I petted them both and they calmed down, and I was going to make those cats friends. I moved them a little clos- er and I moved them a little closer. Each time they would tense up and I would pet them. I did not have a shirt on, Madam Speaker, and in a split-sec- ond, those two cats hit each other, and I was blood from head to toe from the claws. We cannot repatriate Albanians and Serbians together who want to kill each other. If you killed my children or my wife or my mother or my father or my in-laws, it would take a long time and a whole lot of psychologists to sit me down next to the people that I felt had done that. It is going to take a long time of work to make that hap- pen. Then when you bring them back, are you going to have them stay in tents, for those that do not have homes? You have to establish some type of secu- rity. That is where the peacekeepers of the Russians, the Greeks, the Scan- dinavians, the Italians, are; not NATO. The President and Tony Blair are all bent, it has to be NATO, it has to be NATO or nothing, it has to be NATO. The ego and prestige of NATO is not the issue here, it is people that have been thrown out of their homes. It is people that feel that they have been persecuted. That is the issue, Madam Speaker; not NATO, not the prestige and ego of Tony Blair or the President of the United States. That inner body is going to have a difficult time and a long time to repa- triate those citizens from Albania. The President has to look the Albanian president in the eyes and Izetbegovich, the head of the Muslims in Sarajevo, and demand that all Middle East fun- damentalists be deported within 30 days. Why? Because if they do not, these mujahedeen and Hamas from Iran and Afghanistan and Syria are the ones that want a worldwide Jihad. They want to kill all Americans. They are going to stir the pot, they are going to cause problems over the next decades. If we allow and the President allows them to stay there, even a small num- ber, it is going to be a problem. I have talked to the Orthodox Catho- lic Church both of the Serbs and theCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3447 May 20, 1999 Greek Orthodox Church. I have talked to groups of about 200,000 Serbian Americans. They support Kosovo re- maining a part of greater Yugoslavia. But at the same time, they realize there may have to be a cantonization of the area, much like the Scandina- vian nations do, where you might have a separate area where the speech and schools are French or German or Swiss. They support that initiative. That may be the first start for a new Ram- bouillet. But in my opinion, if you try and take Kosovo away from greater Serbia, it is a no win policy. NATO in Europe has to rebuild Kosovo, France, Germany, England, Italy, not the United States. We have already spent $14 billion in 6 weeks. This is a European issue. The United States is part of NATO and should have leadership, but we should not pay more than the lion's share. The United States can use its intel- ligence services and the number of CIA that we have. George Tenet told me that our assets around the world that monitor terrorism are extremely lim- ited; that because of Kosovo, we have had to pull those assets into Kosovo, which leaves us vulnerable in the United States. So I feel that our intelligence assets have to be increased greatly, and the support that this Congress gives them is necessary. /ballot1730 The United Nations, who has become part of the problem in this, votes against the United States 90 percent of the time. We only have one vote in the United Nations. They vote against this 90 percent of the time, and we pay the lion's share of the United Nations again. Until those reforms are done, the President should say, ``No more money, United Nations.'' In my opin- ion, I would like to do away with them permanently. There needs to be an international body. If my colleagues expect Milosevic to negotiate, knowing that he is going to go before a war tribunal for war crimes, do my colleagues think he is going to ever stop? No. But I think an independent body should be established to look at Tudjman, the head of the Croatians, that murdered 10,000 Serbs in 1995 and forced ethnic cleansing out of Croatia of 750,000 Serbs. When we talk about Holocaust, that comes much closer to a Holocaust than Kosovo. The gentlewoman just before and the gentleman was talking about, look at the Kurds. Look at 25 different areas around the world that are far worse than this. Are they despicable? Yes. Are they Holocaust? No. The spin will not gain the President the Nobel Peace Prize. Our United States military, we have got to rebuild it. I believe that peace does come through strength. Our 300- ship Navy that was established by the QDR, which is a report that says this is what we need to fight two wars. The bottoms up review for the services, ourservice chief said we cannot fight two wars. Is that why we have left the no- fly zone in Iraq? I do not guess Saddam Hussein is a problem anymore, because he is left unattended to do his will. We need to build up our military, to replace the benefits of our military, and give them the strength so that we can walk softly and carry a big stick, instead of the President walking softly and carrying a big stick of candy for everybody. I read this week where the President plans on paying the Albanians who house Albanian refugees, paying for that. Are we establishing a welfare sys- tem in Albania while we cannot sup- port Social Security and Medicare and education and medical research in our own country? I think that is wrong. The President has got to look at the President of Albania and demand that, since in 1850 the Albanians have want- ed to take over through expansionism, Macedonia, Montenegro, parts of Greece and Kosovo, and he has got to say no more. We have got to recognize the borders that have been formed and stay within them. I think that we also need to take a look, and the President, to get very tough on the foreign policy of Russia and China. We know that Russia today still, even though they say they are not, ships chemical and biological weapons and nuclear components to Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, and we let it happen, and to North Korea. The President in 1996 was briefed that there was espionage at our labora- tories here in the United States and did nothing until 1999, where the Secretary of Energy has just started to do some things with Mike Richardson. He is doing what should have been done back in 1996. The President was briefed in 1996 that the Chinese had stole our W\u00b188 nu- clear warhead, which is a small nuclear warhead, which took us billions of dol- lars, billions of dollars to develop and years. We have an asset, but I cannot tell my colleagues what it is, where we re- verse-engineered, that we were going to use that asset. We were building a sys- tem to combat the asset. Our system would not have worked, but we had that asset, so it saved us billions of dollars by having that asset and seeing how it worked so that we did not go the wrong direction. Now the Chinese have got not only the W\u00b188 warhead, but they have got secondary and tertiary missile boosts, which they did not have the capability to do. George Tennet told us that Korea was 10 years away from being able to hit the United States with a missile, a nuclear missile. Guess what. They have it today with a Taepo Dong 1 and Taepo Dong 2 that China gave to them that we gave to the Chinese and they are exporting. If that is not bad enough, the capa- bility to MIRV, to put several of those W\u00b188, and the President knew thatChina had these, the White House gave them the capability to use the MIRVing techniques that, again, took us billions of dollars to engineer. If that is not bad, the targeting methods to use those missiles to make them accurate within a meter, a nu- clear weapon. That was done after $1 million was donated by Loral and $1 million from Hughes and $300,000 from Liu Cheng Ying, who is the daughter of General Ying, head of technology in the PLA, to the Clinton-Gore cam- paign. So, Madam Speaker, we have a monu- mental foreign policy problem. It is not just Kosovo. It is Russia. It is Greece. It is Libya. It is Kosovo. I feel that we need to chase the Turks out of North- ern Cyprus, which they have held ille- gally for 25 years, and we have done nothing, because we need the Turk's support. But, yet, we let them stay in Northern Cyprus against international law. Madam Speaker, it grieves me to see our Nation at war, especially when I think that we do not have to be there. From all of my military experience, to see a war run ad hoc and so desperately misused, it has cost human life, it has cost human suffering, and it is going to prevent many of us on both sides of the aisle from doing some of the things that we want with our domestic issues here in the United States such as So- cial Security, Medicare, education, medical research and defense. It is not a pretty time, Madam Speaker. The President has got to get off his pulpit, whatever his agenda is, and he has got to recognize and put himself, as Jesse Jackson rec- ommended to the President, to see both sides of this issue, to come, whether he has to admit defeat or have a small victory and declare a victory, I do not care, but we cannot put ground troops in, because even if we put ground troops into Kosovo, we are going to lose people. The Chetnik type individuals, the guerillas will kill our people. I feel that the KLA, Mujahedin and Hamas will kill our people and blame it on somebody just to keep the pot going. Then if we do, we have just bought Kosovo for $3 billion to $5 billion a year, when we are already in Bosnia at $16 billion and Haiti. We are still in Korea for 25 years. It is time to get out, Madam Speak- er. It is time to build up the United States, to pay down our debt, and to take care of some of our domestic prob- lems here. /fdash COLUMBINE HIGH SCHOOL The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen- tleman from Missouri (Mr. G EPHARDT ) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GEPHARDT. Mr. Speaker, today is the 1-month anniversary of the trag- edy at Littleton, Colorado. I hoped to come to the floor today to speak on what we as a Nation need to begin toCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3448 May 20, 1999 do to solve this epidemic of youth vio- lence. I did not expect that we would have had another shooting at another high school, serving as another alarm, as if we needed one, prompting us to act. During the memorial service in Littleton, a singer, Phil Driscoll, sang a song that he wrote for the occasion. In the song, he sang a line that I can- not get out of my mind. The line was, ``This is a wake-up call. How many in- nocent have to fall.'' Today we received another wake-up call coming from Conyers, Georgia. What a wake-up call it was. But what can be done to solve the problem? What can we do to address the concerns of students and parents? I think there is a lot we must do and a lot that we can do. I refuse to accept the defeatist attitude which says this is a complex problem, and, therefore, there is nothing that Congress can do about it. That is wrong, and that is un- acceptable. We have a national security crisis in our schools. We have lost more Amer- ican children in our schools than American soldiers in Kosovo. This is a national security crisis which requires the same kind of mobilization that we apply to any military threat abroad. Obviously attention must be paid to the accessibility of guns in our society and the frequent and intense images of violence in our mass media. Clearly, we can make guns less accessible to kids. We can try to give parents better tools to supervise what their children are watching or playing on the TV or the Internet. Legislation has been debated and passed on the floor of the Senate over the past week that tried to make progress on limiting the access of kids to guns. I favor effective legislation to keep guns out of the hands of kids and hope the House will take up this legis- lation before we leave for Memorial Day. This makes sense and should have no impact on law-abiding citizens who want to purchase and own guns for sporting use and their own protection. We are talking about passing common- sense, child-safety legislation to make sure that children cannot get easy ac- cess to guns. I hope the House can follow the Sen- ate's lead and move this kind of legis- lation forward without loopholes. But child-related gun legislation is only one part of the puzzle. There is a lot we must do to make sure that our children are not exposed to inappro- priate violent material in the media. The Vice President has begun a dis- cussion with Internet companies to publish the same ratings for on-line gaming that most TV shows have al- ready. The President has called on the movie theaters to better enforce the rating process that is already in place there. Newspapers must also do a bet- ter job of making the rating systems clear to parents. Even if we are able to make the progress we hope for in these twoareas, we know that these steps alone will not solve the problem. We need to address the broader issue of the quality of our children's education and how to give them the attention they need to grow up to be healthy in both mind and body. At the President's meeting on school violence at the White House, various experts on violence repeatedly made the point that this problem of school violence is a problem with many lay- ers. They also said that such a com- plicated problem demanded more than single simple solutions. One cause of the problem is that par- ents spend nearly one-third less time with children than they did a genera- tion ago. With more single-parent fam- ilies and more parents working more jobs and more hours and spending more time in traffic, there is just a lot less time for parents to be with and com- municate with and raise their children. /ballot1745 In many families today, the kids are left alone most of the time. And as we all know, kids do not raise themselves. When parents are home, they often do not spend as much time talking with their children. With television, the Internet, pagers, and other distrac- tions, parents communicate less with kids even when they are able to be home. Before television, time around the dinner table was a time for family communication. Now if a family has time for dinner together, many fami- lies have the television on during din- ner and nobody really talks to one an- other. Another factor that was mentioned was the amount of domestic violence and child abuse that some young peo- ple are exposed to today. We have al- ways had these problems, but the prob- lem is far worse now than it has ever been. It is obvious that children ex- posed to abuse are much more prone to resort to violence in their own lives. Another factor is the size of high schools. Most of our schools were built after World War II when we were trying to accommodate the baby boom. The schools were built large for economic reasons, and the size did not matter when families were intact and parents could spend more time with children. However, in today's world, it is unwise to have anonymous children in large schools. Another problem is the increasing di- agnosis of mental illness among chil- dren. One of the experts at the summit said that mental illness is more preva- lent than ever but health insurance covers these problems less than ever. Consequently, many kids have prob- lems but cannot get the professional mental help that they need. One expert said that our problems stem from what adults do to children or do not do for children. The answers to our problems lie with adults and what we can do to raise children prop- erly. We spend so much of our debate and our time addressing the symptoms ofviolence but not the causes of violence. We talk about guns or conflict resolu- tion or school violence programs. And it is right that we do so. But we spend far too little time discussing how we can prevent these problems in the first place. It is obvious that the modern family needs help in filling the time holes that exist. The only institution, in my view, that can possibly fill these holes are our public schools. Schools have com- plained about the need to fill all these holes. But the truth is that only through the public schools can we achieve the scale that we need to solve these problems with all the children of our country. We need nothing short of a revolu- tion in our public schools to deal with the modern problems that children face in the modern world. Nostalgia for the past, criticism of other institutions for not meeting these challenges, or finger pointing at institutions that are not doing enough will not get us to a solu- tion of these problems. We must really begin to build the public will to do what is necessary to really solve these problems. Raising and educating children correctly is a huge task and will not happen without human will to achieve that goal. In World War II, everyone thought America was way behind and would not win. What critics misunderstood was the will of the American people. Once every American internalized the goal of winning the war, each one of them did what was necessary on a daily basis and the war was won. The same can be achieved with our children, but a simi- lar effort to what took place in World War II must be achieved. All of us, whether we have children or not, has a responsibility to enter into this effort to educate and raise our children. It is in our deep self-interest to do this. Government at all levels must help, and local government has the major responsibility. I hope in the days ahead we will work together to find answers to this crisis. Before the memorial service in Littleton, I went with Colin Powell and Vice President G ORE and the gentle- woman from Colorado (Ms. D EGETTE ), other members of the Colorado delega- tion, to meet with the parents of the dead children. We met with them for an hour and a half before the memorial service. We hugged them. We cried with them. I told them that the whole coun- try was there with us standing with them at this time of terror and sorrow. One of the mothers, after sobbing un- controllably and shaking in my arms, pulled back with a picture of her child and she said, ``Congressman, I hope you will lead in the Congress to make sure that my child did not die in vain.'' I will never get her face out of my mind. And now we have more fathers and mothers in Georgia who today are say- ing, ``I hope my child was not injured in vain.''CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3449 May 20, 1999 How many more children have to go down for all of us to accept the respon- sibility that we have to see that chil- dren are cared for and loved and re- spected and disciplined so that this does not happen again? We may not be able to agree on much here, but we owe every parent who has lost a child to violence our best, honest efforts to work together as a Congress to solve some of these problems. I am not so arrogant to think that we have the power to single-handedly solve these problems. But we need to start the process of reaching out to one another for comprehensive, meaning- ful, effective solutions. We need an honest discussion of the profound changes that are happening in our soci- ety and what we can agree will begin to change our culture so that all of our children, every one of them, is raised to be a productive, law-abiding, con- tributing citizen in this great society. If we cannot somehow do that, we will be consigned to more and more Littletons and more and more Conyers, Georgia. Every day in our country we lose 13 young people to suicide and violence. Every day there is a Littleton. And it has to come to an end. If we cannot act on something as important as our fam- ilies and our futures, then we will fail in our most basic duty to promote the safety and well-being of all of our peo- ple. We must do it now, not a month from now. We must do it before the next breaking news on CNN about another school shooting. We must do it before we see the pictures of children running across the lawns of schools trying to find safety. We must do it before we get another wake-up call and another spec- ter of death among our young people in our schools. We have already waited too long. We have overslept. It is time to wake up. It is time to hear the wake-up call and to say, this must stop, this must end. And as another parent at Littleton told me, ``Surely,'' as tears rolled down his face, ``we can do better.'' This is the greatest country that has ever existed on Earth. We have a na- tional crisis. The crisis is among our young people and it is in our schools. And surely we can summon the good- ness and the greatness of our people and all of us to face down this death and to bring it to a final and lasting conclusion. /fdash CRISIS IN OUR SCHOOLS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. EMERSON ). Under the Speaker's an- nounced policy of January 6, 1999, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. S TUPAK ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the des- ignee of the minority leader. Mr. STUPAK. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. G EPHARDT ), the Demo- cratic leader, for those words. And I would also like the R ECORD to note that earlier today, when we finishedbusiness, that the gentleman from Illi- nois (Mr. H ASTERT ) also came down and spoke about recent shootings and trag- edies facing this country. I want to speak tonight, as the Speaker's designee in our special order, about what we Democrats as a party have been trying to do here to address this very, very serious national crisis, as the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. GEPHARDT ), our Democratic leader, stated. But what we say here tonight, I want everyone to understand, is not a Demo- cratic or Republican issue. We want to work with both sides to try to bring some consensus if we can on things that we should take as a Nation. But I think it is important for us to under- stand where some of us see as where we are going. And things I say here tonight are my beliefs as the convening chair of the Crime and Drug Task Force for the Democrats, not just this Congress but the past Congress, and does not nec- essarily reflect the views of everybody in our caucus. And I am sure they do not reflect the views of my Republican friends. But some of us are beginning to sit back and try to meet individually and bipartisan; and, as a Democratic cau- cus, we have been convening the chairs of the Education Task Force, the Health and Human Services Task Force, of the Crime and Drug Task Force and we have been meeting. We were meeting before the tragedy of a month ago out in Colorado and really since the first of the year really. We had numerous meetings. In fact, today we had another one that we con- vened and tried to kick around more and more ideas and bounce ideas off people. I know many of us, both Demo- crats and Republicans, have been in schools and talking with teachers and parents and what can we could. As the convening chair, my qualifica- tions before I came into the U.S. Con- gress was I was a police officer for 12 years as a city police officer and as a Michigan State police trooper and worked with juveniles, worked in juve- nile crime areas, and taught criminal investigations at the academies and constitutional law and everything else. And the school violence issue that has swept across the Nation the last 18 months, it is hard to put into words how it has torn at so many of us and how do we best address it. What we have found through all of the meetings, through everything that has happened, even with the shootings today in Conyers, Georgia, I think the only thing we can see say is this is a very complex issue and there is no sin- gle solution, there is no magic program that we can pass that would solve this. And we have got to get past blame games. I know the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. G EPHARDT ), the Democratic lead- er, again has asked the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H ASTERT ) to try to put to- gether a bipartisan group. And I hope we can do that.As we looked at what has happened, many of us see America has become alienated from each other. We see in- creases in hate crimes. For our chil- dren, we see and the experts tell us that we spend over the last 15 years one-third less time with our children than we did 15 years ago. So there is maybe less structure, maybe less dis- cipline there, less guidance for our children. For our children, the alienation that we see is now surfacing in schools. So- ciety's problems are beginning to sur- face in schools. And even from our own leadership, I think when we have dis- putes on the floor which end in harsh words amongst each other does not speak well of the House as a whole or elected leaders and contributes to that alienation. It is time for people to come together to try to reconcile our differences, the ill will that exists not only on the House floor of the U.S. Congress but the ill will that may exist in our fami- lies, our homes, our schools, our com- munities, our leaders, and even within ourselves. So how do we end alienation and begin reconciliation to end the school and personal violence that we see that is gripping the headlines every night? How we do it is probably as varied as America. What works in North Caro- lina may not work in Michigan. Or we know the program that may work in North Carolina, character education, as they tell me, we may know it by a different name in Michigan where I represent. But what works in my northern rural district certainly will not work in the inner cities of our great cities. /ballot1800 But what we understand is this. We understand that 100,000 weapons, be it guns or knives, come to school each day. We know that there are four times more guns out there, handguns, than there are children going to school, so there is access to guns readily avail- able. We know as the Democratic lead- er said, there are 13 deaths per day of young people in America. We know that school psychologists tell us that probably 20 percent of the kids, stu- dents from K through 12 probably 20 percent of them need some help in dealing with problems at home, call it mental health problems, if you will. They also tell us that 3 to 6 percent of the students in our schools have severe mental health problems. So when children lash out with those statistics, with the ready availability of weapons coming to and from school, you can see how the violence erupts and comes out and we see the headlines we see each and every day. We ask the statisticians and others in our meet- ings, is there a large enough sample of violence with the shootings that have occurred in the last 18 months, enough of a sample to say, are there similar characteristics of school violence in America? They have told us, no, theCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3450 May 20, 1999 sample is not large enough, that any kind of conclusions you may draw from the incidents may very well be skewed because they have been small. Let us hope the sample does not get any larger. But we should not wait until there is enough violence in our schools to say, ``Okay, now we have enough sample, what can we do?'' I think there is enough for us to work together as Democrats and Republicans to come together and start to look at what can we do. There have been many ideas kicked around. I would just like to share some of them tonight, not that any one of these ideas would be a solution but at least I want the Congress and the American people to know we are think- ing, we are looking, we are probing, we are asking the questions and we need your input. Many of us feel that maybe there should be a national commission to examine not just the short-term but what are the long-term impacts, what is the long-term approach that we want to take here? It seems like violence in America is constantly shifting. Maybe we need a national focus, much like maybe the Carter Commission we had in the late 1960s to address the problems facing the country then that actually put forth some proposals and some solu- tions. How do schools and communities access what may work or may not work? What ideas are out there? How do they reach out? You have so many programs going on in the Federal and State governments and Department of Education and Department of Justice and the Health and Human Services and public health, can we not somehow put these programs under an umbrella so schools can easily access to learn what is working in northern Michigan that may work in southern California. Can we have a national clearinghouse? Can we be under a commission and an agency? Can we do a one-stop shopping area, if you will, so we know what is working? We have plenty of studies out there across this country that says this works up here in Boston, Massachu- setts, or character education based on this model will work in North Carolina, or school resource officers work in Michigan. How do we allow everyone to access it? New Jersey has a program called crisis intervention officers. Is that different from a school resource officer which is really community po- licing where parents and teachers and students work together in a partner- ship to keep down crime and violence in the schools. We have met with former pro football star Jim Brown. His program Ameri- Can is a great program that may help us and is being used in 14 different States right now to address after- school problems and self-esteem that young people need. His program looks like one that may work. It may not work again in my northern Michigan area but it certainly is one we should look at. Each community, each Stateis unique unto themselves, but as we have seen in the last 18 months, we are all subject to the same violence in fam- ilies and in schools and communities. From the victims families, from all the folks we have had a chance to talk to, it seems there is a lot of confusion and hopelessness and despair out there. As I said, there is no simple solution. There is no political quick fix. We need vision. That is why I was so pleased today to see both the Democratic lead- er and the Speaker speaking of a will- ingness to work together and a need of a vision in this country, an action and a long-term commitment. Unfortu- nately in the United States Congress, we authorize and pass programs that will last for 1 year or we do a pilot pro- gram for a year or two. Then if it looks pretty good, we will use a 3-year pro- gram or a 5-year program. But I think we need a long-term commitment here. We need at least a commitment of a generation. I think it is incumbent upon this generation to start putting forth and thinking long-term so we can save not only this but also future gen- erations. As I said earlier, the family situa- tions, the situations that we see in school are reflective of so many fami- lies that are surfacing in the schools. So you cannot say it is a State issue. You cannot say it is a local issue. I think the Federal Government must show some resolve. By that, we in the Democratic Party believe that it is not just something that we pass a program and then block grant it to the States. We at the Federal level must show the resolve. We cannot shirk from this re- sponsibility. We just cannot block grant away another national problem. This is a national problem and it is begging for a national solution. But if you are going to get at the root of the problem, I think you have to strike at maybe four main elements we have seen, we have looked at, we have stud- ied, we have discussed in our many meetings and discussions with experts. It is what is happening in our commu- nities, what is happening in our homes, what is happening in schools and yes, what is even happening with the pro- liferation of guns when we have four handguns for every student going to school floating around these commu- nities, the easy accessibility of them. Do you address all four of them? I think you have to address all four be- cause all are interrelated. They are interconnected. All are branches, if you will, on a tree that combine to form a trunk or the base but underneath there lie the roots and the roots which an- chor the tree, the forbidden tree, if you will, the anchor of school violence and death that we have unfortunately seen once again here today. The branches on this tree, be it guns, schools and com- munities or the home, look remarkably similar, and it probably should, be- cause it is us. It is really America. It is what we teach. It is what we teach the baby roots, our children, if you will. So when they grow, they become the an-chor of the tree of school violence and death. So let us not fail to see the forest but for the trees and let us not fail to see America for the violence we are experi- encing because America is the greatest country there has ever been. We have an opportunity here now to stop and look at what is going on in this coun- try, in our communities, in our schools, in our homes, and what can we do as a Nation? The violence, we just cannot look at it in other people. We have to look within ourselves. Because the violence is ingrained. It is not just what we do or what we say, but I think we also have to go beyond that and the violence or the signals we send can also be caused by what we do not do or what we do not say. By what we do, like rec- oncile differences within our homes, our families and our schools and our communities would be a start. So where do we start? If we focus with the schools, as I said earlier, I believe soci- ety's problems are surfacing here, for all to see, to place our sons and daugh- ters and children in with the schools, let us focus on the schools and what should we be advocating, what should we be doing? Again, there is no simple program to pass, if the Congress would pass it and fund it, it would go away. Congress cannot reconcile America's alienation within the family or within each of us, but we certainly can en- courage you, support you and assist you. And here are some of the ways some of us believe we should start. The Federal Head Start program. Can we not expand that program? Many of us for years have said, look, at 3 to 5 years old, they should be in Head Start. We should fully fund it. But if we expand that program, can we not teach mandatory in the curriculum vi- olence prevention and conflict resolu- tion? Why can we not take that one and expand it? It has been interesting as we have had the Law Enforcement Caucus, we have had experts in many times and it has been interesting that the larger cities have noticed the prob- lems they were having in their schools and part of their curriculum is violence prevention and conflict resolution. It is interesting to note it has not been the larger school districts that we see that are having the violence that we have been witnessing lately. Maybe there is something there that we should teach and why not start it at the Federal Head Start program? We have the healthy child program. It is a program that coupled aspects of it, last year in the balanced budget agreement, we put in CHIPs, Children's Health Initiative Program, CHIPs as we call it for short. That was to help young people who do not have health insurance have health insurance. In the State of Michigan, we are like 20,000 applications behind. Peo- ple are waiting 6 months to access this program. They are either going to be in the Medicaid program or the CHIPs program. Why do they have to wait 6 months? Why are we 20,000 applications behind, when I was bringing it up withCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3451 May 20, 1999 the governors representatives and then we really do not have a good idea or a good answer on why they cannot expe- dite the program and provide it to these people, to the young people who are uninsured, especially when we talk about the mental health provisions that 20 percent of the students are coming to school with mental health problems or difficulties or need some- one to talk to and 3 to 6 percent of them have severe mental health, how come we are not addressing that? Why are we not expanding these programs to address these needs? If you take the K through 12, we have heard from school counselors and probably every- body across America says, ``Yeah, I know a school counselor,'' but when you talk to the counselors, we say what are you doing, are you there to counsel, are you there to help, are you there to be there for the students, to interact with them. Basically they tell us, ``Well, we really don't have time be- cause we're busy with the busing schedule,'' or ``We're busy doing the curriculum,'' or ``We're busy preparing the students for the next round of test- ing going on by this group or that group or the State,'' or ``We just really are helping the students who want to go on to college with their college ap- plications and things like this.'' The counseling that we envisioned or we saw when we were in school just is not there anymore. So if the counseling, be it nurses, psychologists, school re- source officers, crisis intervention offi- cers, counselors, cops in the schools, should we not make sure that if they are going to do this, they have the op- portunity to do it and not get bogged down and not be utilized for busing or for curriculum development or testing or college applications? Should they not really have it, should there not be a professional staff that could help there? And should that not in order to protect them from the budget cuts that occur all the time as local taxpayers struggle to keep their millage rates low to provide a quality education? If they are the first people who are cut every time there is a budget cut, is there a place then for the Federal Gov- ernment to step forward and say, look, if there are going to be professional staff, should the Federal Government not at least put forth the majority of their salary so they are not subject to these cutbacks, so they can be there to interact? And what about before and after school programs? Everyone tells us that the juvenile crime rate is the highest between 4 o'clock and 8 p.m. at night when the students are out of school and they have idle time on their hands. Can we not have programs? I have often wondered why these so- called after-school programs are only run during school but when young peo- ple are out and about the most during the summer, there is no program. Should there not really be a year-round program for them? Should cities or schools not do sponsorship? Like in ourcity we have the summer recreation program but after school starts, what about those who are no longer in sports, what is for them? In my home- town after that? Again can we use these professional Federal staff people to assist there? That is something I think we should take a look at. We talked a lot about school hot lines. School hot lines, ones that have been used out East here quite a bit with some success. Those were the school hot lines we talked about the student using if they have a concern, be it safety or just a concern, they can use the hotline to call in and someone would get back with them, be it one of those counselors or nurses or crisis intervention people or school re- source officers. With the recent incidents from Colo- rado and now too in Georgia, the super- intendents are telling us and even in my district, even last Monday we had another bomb threat, how do you crack down on that if you have a hotline? Does that become the hotline for the bomb threats or the assaults or alleged assaults on the school? Then do you put in the caller ID? Can you crew the trap lines? Can you backtrack it, to cut down on these? And why could the hotline not be a parent's link to the school to see what is going on in the school, what events are going on, what is the drama club doing, what is their next event? Also why can the home- work assignments not be there so the parents know if there is homework as- signments, so they can take an active role in there? Another suggestion we have heard in our many, many meetings is why can we not do hold and safe rooms? Hold and safe rooms is, I mentioned earlier, 100,000 weapons come to school every day with young people. If you are with a weapon in school, what happens? Do you hopefully not like what happened in one school shooting incident where the student came with a weapon in school, was sent home, got more weap- ons and unfortunately violence erupted. /ballot1815 So holding safe rooms, should each district have one, have one designated, that is a program that does not even cost anything, but what it tells us is a student comes here with a weapon, we are just not going to release them back into the community without holding them and making sure they are safe and making sure all precautions are taken to protect that student, other students and the community itself. And what if the student is removed from school? I have heard governors say throughout this great Nation of ours, that first student that comes to a class with a weapon, just throw them out of school, no questions asked. Then where does it go? Where does the stu- dent go? Back into our communities? Do they work? Where do they go? There is nothing to help them, and just letting them loose back into thecommunity does not seem to be the an- swer of all we have seen in these recent months, in the last 2 years. So some States have what they call alternative schools. Some of us like to call them reentry schools. And if you are going to be suspended for whatever, be it weapons or what- ever it may be, why not, before you come back into your school, there is a reentry which must address the rea- sons for your suspension, and espe- cially if it had something to do with weapons or drugs or alcohol. Let us an- swer, let us answer those questions be- fore you reenter. I indicated earlier that guns unfortu- nately are readily accessible and four guns for every one student we have, and 100,000 weapons come to school a day, and we have 13 deaths a day of young people. How do you begin to ad- dress that? If you are going to start ad- dressing legislation such as that, I think not only you have to address what is happening in communities but also in our homes. And in the last week you have seen many dramatic votes in the Senate on it, everything from 21 years old to pur- chase hand guns to closing the Brady loophole on checks at gun shows and pawn shops and child safety locks and liability and storage, and these are things I think that we have to address and at least talk about. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, conserv- ative, liberal, it is something we have to have a discussion about, and hope- fully it can be a meaningful discussion. We have talked, many of us, and I know even today the Speaker men- tioned about ratings on games and Internet access and things like that; and besides all the meetings we have been having, we have been hearing arti- cles and experts talk about are we real- ly training our children to kill, and they talk about the desensitization which is going on with children. And many experts have said, and if I can quote from one or two articles, children do not naturally kill, they learn it from violence in the home, and most pervasively from violence as en- tertainment and television, movies and interactive video games. And they go on to say that every time a child plays an interactive video game, he is learn- ing the exact same conditioned reflex skills as a soldier or a police officer in training. Mr. Speaker, every parent in Amer- ica desperately wants to be warned of the impact of TV and other violent media on children, but unfortunately we have seen, I said on the Committee on Commerce, unfortunately we have seen a lot of our TV networks sort of stonewall what it really means in our key means of public education in America, and I hope we are not stonewalling them. These are all issues that we have been trying to address, and there have been again many, many articles that we have looked at, we have argued about, we have debated, and we con- tinue to look for answers. As I said,CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3452 May 20, 1999 there is no one single program, there is no one single solution, there is no Democratic or Republican solution here. We must work together on this. As we talked about the counselors, there are about 90,000 counselors right now in America, and they are in the public schools from middle to high school. We have 90,000 counselors for 19.4 million students. That comes out to about 1 counselor for every 450 stu- dents. But as we spoke to those counselors and their representatives, they said, ``We do not get a chance to counsel anymore like we used to. We actually spend time,'' as I said earlier, ``helping on developing core curriculum, helping on the busing schedule, helping out with kids wanting to go on to college,'' and how do we help them out there, ``and just basically doing testing, test- ing, testing so our school scores well on the test so we can hopefully get more resources.'' But the kids are lost in the whole shuffle. So is it feasible to put in 100,000 more counselors, much as we did 100,000 cops on the street, to stop this violence that we see in our schools? And if you looked at it, that would add about 100,000 more counselors, would bring it down to 1 to 250 students. But then we got to make sure those counselors are not bogged down doing busing, or test- ing, or core curriculum development, or college preparation. And what about after school pro- grams? We think there are many of them, good programs that can work, whether it is Amer-I-Can or Boys and Girls Clubs or whatever, why can we not do those things? As my colleagues know, we just did an emergency supplemental appropria- tions that the President asked for $6 billion, ended up being $15 billion, and we passed that. Can we not put forth an emergency school supplemental appro- priation? And what about family, school and teacher initiatives? Why can we not have these hot lines? Why can we not expand the family medical leave that we tried to do, to make it available so parents can go to school to spend some time with their children, whether or not, not just at report card time but other times? Why can we not expand that? These are just some of the ideas I said that have come out of the Demo- cratic Caucus. We have been working on it since the first of the year. It has taken on new urgency with the situa- tion in Colorado and again here today in Conyers, Georgia, but I want you to know that we have been working and thinking and trying to take your sug- gestions and ideas that have come from the American people and from the psy- chologists and National Education As- sociation and American Federation of Teachers and everyone we met with, and as House Members we have even met with Senate Members. And again, we are all trying to pull together, and unfortunately today's incident onceagain leads me to come to the floor to- night to join with the Democratic lead- ers and others to try to talk about what we are doing, what we are doing. And I notice one of the leaders in this area, Mr. R OEMER from Indiana, is here, and at this time I yield to the gentleman. Mr. ROEMER. Mr. Speaker, first of all I want to thank my good friend, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. S TU- PAK), from the Midwest, right next to Indiana, my home State, for having this special order on a very, very im- portant topic in America today. I want to commend our leader, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. G EPHARDT ) for tak- ing the time to come to the floor to ad- dress this very, very important issue for all Americans in facing, and not only are we facing trying to come up with creative and bold and innovative solutions to make our schools better, we need to make our schools safer. I was sitting in my office just min- utes ago making phone calls back home to Indiana to talk to and listen to farmers, and our farmers are going through a very difficult time in small town communities with the price of beans and corn and hogs being so low. And I was speaking with some of them, and some of them were saying, well, we are in danger of going out of business and we are having all kinds of problems in our small town communities, but we have our family and we have our chil- dren, and we will get through this. Imagine, imagine what some families in America are going through today in Paducah, in Jonesboro, in Springfield, in Littleton, in Georgia today, that had their children shot at school, have children injured and sent to the hos- pital, are scared about sending their children to a public school or a private school to get an education in America today. That is a compelling issue for this Congress to address and address in a bipartisan way, address in a thought- ful way, address in maybe a short term way but in also a long term way, with vision, with perspective, with a lot of thought and with, hopefully, a lot of answers. I cannot imagine, as a parent of three children, being in the shoes of some of the parents that are in these cities across America, in these suburbs across America, in these situations across America where their children are in danger, where their children are being harmed, where their children might be shot. And just on CNN tonight in a Gal- lup poll, they did a Gallup poll to 13 and 17-year-olds, asking our 13 and 17- year-old children in schools today, ``Do you feel safe?'' Asking them what some of the biggest problems are in our schools: peer pressure and the cliques and standing up for what you think is right and against somebody putting down other students in very harmful and mean ways. But we have to get back, and I think my colleague from Michigan (Mr. S TU- PAK) understands this, we have to get back in Congress to helping try to havea national dialogue, as education is the number one issue across America. Every single union hall I go into, it is the number one issue, every single business I go into it is the number one issue, every single home I knock on in Indiana it the number one issue. And now not only are we concerned with better schools, innovative schools, creative schools, helping with charter schools, helping with this Ed-Flex pro- gram that we just passed, but we must be concerned with safer schools. We cannot let this happen over and over and over again, from Arkansas to Mis- sissippi to Kentucky to Colorado to Or- egon to Georgia. We do not want this happening in Indiana, and I know in my good friend's home State of Michi- gan and Port Huron the other day we had another instance of potential vio- lence. So I would hope that the Speaker and the Leader could get together, I would hope Democrats and Republicans could join together to discuss in a national way, with national dialogue and input from a lot of different sources, teachers and parents and principals and coun- selors, people that think that families are the number one concern and the number one answer, people that think that media violence is the number one concern and the number one answer, people that think that metal detectors and safety and security measures in schools are the number one concern and number one answer, people that think that there are too many guns in society. Mr. Speaker, let us have these de- bates. I do not necessarily think that we can legislate everything here to an- swer this compelling problem on the House floor, but we can talk about the importance of family and the role of bringing up our children, we can talk about how parents must be at that kitchen table and talking and listening to our children. We can talk about how this has to be done more in America. We can talk, and hopefully talk and re- spect the First Amendment about the number of media games, of games on the Internet that companies are put- ting out there for our children, that do not need to be sold to our children, that escalate the number of violent ac- tivities on the programs, that reward kids for the more people that they harm on these video games, the more points they get and the more harm they can do. We do not need to be sell- ing those products to our children. And we can talk about some, yes, some answers that maybe Congress can come up with. We can talk about maybe some ways to put some pro- grams together to allow our local schools to pick from a host of different answers, whether those answers be that the school picks from looking at put- ting more metal detectors in the schools, to having more counselors in the schools, to having more mental and psychiatric resources available in the schools, to more D.A.R.E. officers in the schools, to other proven researchCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3453 May 20, 1999 methods that make our schools safer, allow our local schools to pick and choose as they should, as the local schools should do, from a host of dif- ferent measures. /ballot1830 Let us in this great Chamber, where George Washington peers down on us and godly trust is above us, where we have had so many historic debates in this great place, let us discuss the issues of the day. Let us bring edu- cation front and forward to improve schools, to make them better and to use more creative approaches to do that, but also look at the safety issues, to look at what we need to do to give more assurances to our parents and our families, that our schools and the United States of America are going to be safe places for our children. We can do an emergency supple- mental. If we can make that a priority in this country, and I voted for it, to make sure our troops have the re- sources overseas to be successful in battle, we should make sure that our families are talking about the right things. Where we can help, where we cannot, where we cannot legislate this, we can have a national dialogue, but we can talk about many of these other things here in this body, with Repub- licans and Democrats together, sharing in some of the answers, disagreeing maybe on some of the answers but at least proposing some solutions to these problems, with safety in our schools, with better schools in all of our neigh- borhoods across this great land. So I really want to say that there cannot be anything more important that we as a Congress can deal with in this session of Congress. There cannot be anything more important to parents than better schools and safer schools. There cannot be anything more impor- tant in the history of the country as we move into this new millennium than better and safer schools and Congress working together to improve those schools. So I just want to say, in just the few minutes that the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. S TUPAK ) has the special order tonight, that I share in his con- cern; that I applaud his leadership on drawing many people together in the Democratic Caucus to look at a wide variety of answers, whether they be long-term answers, such as I think fully funding Head Start programs and preschool programs, long-term answers like helping our families, encouraging our families to stay together and not implode, looking at counselors and metal detectors and letting local schools pick from a host of solutions, but we need to draw people together in our caucus, we need to draw people to- gether across both lines of our parties. We need to come together to discuss and debate these issues today, in Amer- ica, at our kitchen tables, in our great halls for debate and help solve some of these problems. Again, I want to thank the gen- tleman from Michigan (Mr. S TUPAK ) forhaving this special order. I again want to thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. G EPHARDT ) for taking the time to come to the floor to talk about these issues, and I want to commend the gen- tleman from Michigan (Mr. S TUPAK ) for trying to put some packages together on the crime side, on the juvenile jus- tice side, to also look at some solutions to these vexing and very important problems. Mr. STUPAK. I thank the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. R OEMER ) for joining us tonight and thanks for coming down and joining us. As one of the leaders in the education field, as the gentleman has been, with a new Democratic coali- tion and others, we really appreciate the insight he has given us as to what works in Indiana, in his district, as I said earlier. What works in New Jersey or Michigan or wherever it might be, it may work in that community or that State unique unto itself but all of our communities in this country right now are basically subject to violence in families, in schools and communities. No matter how one cuts it, no matter where one stands on the issues, there just seem to be so many weapons avail- able and so much alienation out there and so many opportunities for violence. I am sure if the gentleman looks closer in his polling results that he has seen, he will see there is sort of like this hopelessness out there, confusion and despair on what we should do, and the gentleman is absolutely right, there is no simple solution. There is no quick political fix to this vexing problem. We need vision, we need action, and we need long-term commitment, and again not just for 1 year or 3 years or 5 years, but at least a generation. I know that the gentleman from Indi- ana (Mr. R OEMER ) has always worked in a bipartisan way with Democrats and Republicans and that is what we are asking here. As the Democratic Caucus, we have been reaching out and we will continue not just to our col- leagues on the other side of the aisle but also over in the Senate to try to find some kind of solutions. All these things, whether it is the community, the schools, the homes or guns, they are all interrelated, inter- connected. We have to be prepared to start addressing all parts of the prob- lem. I wish we could but the Federal Gov- ernment just cannot pass a law, the Federal Government just cannot rec- oncile America, or alienation within the family or even within each other, but we certainly can encourage; we would support and do anything we can to assist. So I certainly appreciate the gentle- man's time and effort in coming down here tonight to speak with us. There is another issue, of course, that is on the minds of all Americans and that is, of course, Kosovo. One of our colleagues, the gentleman from New York (Mr. E NGEL ), wanted to take a few moments, so I am going to yield him some time to talk about that situ- ation.So while we talk about school vio- lence or what is happening, we still have other matters that we must ad- dress again hopefully in a bipartisan way, and I would yield to the gen- tleman from New York (Mr. E NGEL ). Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. S TUPAK ) for yield- ing. Let me just say that I certainly endorse everything that he has said about violence and about the terrible tragedies taking place in our country, in our schools today. As the father of three children, I know that every par- ent grieves when we hear of these trag- edies at our schools. We obviously need to put our heads together, Democrats, Republicans, Americans all. There are no easy solutions, and none of us has the magic answer. We certainly cannot legislate these things. I think as leaders of our great country we need to have a dialogue and we need to put our heads together and come up with something with which all Americans can identify. So I thank my friend from Michigan (Mr. S TUPAK ) for his leadership in this regard. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to speak a bit about violence that is happening on the other side of the world in Europe, and that is the situation in Kosova. I had not intended to speak but I earlier heard the remarks of our colleague, the gentleman from California (Mr. CUNNINGHAM ), and I just felt that some of the things he said really should not be left unchallenged. I believe what the United States is doing in Kosova is noble, and I believe what the President has attempted to do is noble. We could have easily stood by and let the genocide and ethnic cleansing continue and not done a thing and that would have been the easier thing for us to do, but I think to the President's credit and to our great country's credit we decided that we just could not stand idly by 55 and 60 years after the Holocaust and see an- other tragedy going on on the con- tinent of Europe. To those people who say, well, why is the United States involved when there is genocide going on all over the world, obviously we are involved with our NATO allies. NATO is the North Atlan- tic Treaty Organization and so NATO is primarily concerned with what goes on in Europe, and this has a terrible destabilizing effect in the Balkans and indeed on the whole continent of Eu- rope. So we, as one of the lead nations in NATO, as the lead nation in NATO, I believe we need to be very responsive to genocide and ethnic cleansing. Mr. Speaker, there seems to be a tendency in some quarters to unfortu- nately equate the victims of genocide with the oppressors who are carrying out the genocide. We cannot equate those two. It is very, very clear what is going on in Kosova today. The ethnic Albanians are the victims and Mr. Milosevic and his Serbian government are the oppressors. That is clear.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3454 May 20, 1999 There were two million ethnic Alba- nians routed from their homes. I think when we get into Kosova we are going to see 100,000 or more people in mass graves ethnically cleansed. There are already at least 100,000 missing, and we get reports day in and day out of mass graves. We cannot allow that to hap- pen. There are some people that say, well, this did not happen until the bombing started. That is nonsense. This has been going on for years. We have called it slow ethnic cleansing. It is true that the pace has accelerated since the NATO bombing but ethnic cleansing has been going on against the Kosovar Albanians for many, many months and years, a systematic campaign and every negotiated attempt was made to try to get Milosevic to come to his senses, and only when that failed did the bombing start. I went to Rambouillet during the ne- gotiations in France to speak with our American officials and to try to help convince the Kosovar Albanians to ac- cept Rambouillet. They accepted the Rambouillet Accords. Even though it was far short of what they would like, they believe and I believe that they are entitled to independence and to self-de- termination. When the former Yugo- slavia broke up, and it broke up be- cause of Milosevic, every other group in the former Yugoslavia was given the right to independence and self-deter- mination. The Croatians, the Bosnians, the Macedonians, the Slovanians all were given that option and opted for inde- pendent nations. Why are the Kosovar Albanians not given the same option? Why do they have to live in second class status? I think it is very, very clear that Serbia has lost any moral authority ever again to govern the peo- ple of Kosova. They have no right to it. The people of Kosova have the right to independence and self-determination. Ethnic cleansing cannot be tolerated, and I think the principles with which we lay down to stop the bombing re- main firm and must remain firm. There should be no erosion of those prin- ciples. Milosevic knows what he needs to do. In order for the bombing to stop, the Kosovar Albanians need to return to their homes and they need to be pro- tected by international armed forces led by NATO and they ought to have the right of independence and self-de- termination. We ought to, in my estimation, be arming and training the KLA, the Kosova Liberation Army. They are the only counterbalance to the Serbs on the ground. If we do not want Amer- ican troops on the ground, and many people do not, then they are the only counterbalance to the Serbs. I have introduced a bill along with my colleague the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. S ANFORD ) that says that we ought to be arming and training the KLA. In the long-term and in the short-term, we ought to be air-lifting and air dropping anti-tank weaponry to them because they want to turn to us. The KLA wants to work with the west. The KLA wants to work with NATO. If we continue to rebuff them, they are going to go elsewhere for their arms. They may go elsewhere, Iran and other places that we do not like, and then if they do that we can- not then point and say, aha, because it will have been a self-fulfilling proph- ecy. They want to be pro-west. They want to work with us. They want to defeat the Serbs. They want to aid NATO and we have been rebuffing them. It is ashame. It is wrong. It is morally wrong, and it is wrong in terms of what we should be planning. I also believe, Mr. Speaker, that if we are going to fight this war, all options ought to be on the table, including the possible option of ground troops. I do not say this lightly, but I think we cannot tell Milosevic in advance what we will do and what we will not do, be- cause if we tell him what our game plan is he can plan accordingly. That is why he has dispersed his military, he has dispersed his armaments because he does not fear a ground evasion. If we keep him guessing, we will take away a number of options from him. Let me say this about Milosevic: We continue to treat him as if he is some- how the solution, we are going to nego- tiate with him, we are going to deal with him. I read reports where Milosevic supposedly is ready for a deal as long as we state first and foremost that Kosova will remain part of Serbia. That would be a disgrace to give him that. That would be a disgrace to say that we are somehow pretending that since Rambouillet nothing has hap- pened, when we know there are tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thou- sands, of people executed and eth- nically cleansed. So we should not give in to Milosevic's demands. We should hold firm and adhere to those principles. Again, all options should be on the table. We have Apache helicopters in Albania. In my estimation, we ought to be utilizing them. We ought to be doing humanitarian air drops, dropping food to half a million starving Kosovar refu- gees who are trapped in Kosova, who are in the mountains and do not have enough food. I was at Kennedy Airport last week, welcoming the first round of Kosovar refugees coming home to the United States, to be with their families, and they were tears streaming down peo- ple's eyes, hugging and kissing. It was something really to behold. These peo- ple are suffering. Milosevic is a war criminal who ought to be indicted by the International Tribunal in the Hague. We should not be giving in to him, capitulating to him or in my esti- mation even negotiating with him. We need to win this war. We need to guarantee that those people come back to their homes and we need to put those responsible for genocide on trial,and we need to be very, very firm and, again, I believe that we need to arm and train the KLA. I want to enter into the R ECORD two letters. One is from the Veterans of Foreign Wars, which states that the veterans of foreign wars of the United States is resolved that in order to bring this conflict to a rapid and suc- cessful conclusion on terms favorable to NATO we will support the United States acting as part of the NATO alli- ance, taking decisive action with the full range of overwhelming military power to eject, remove or otherwise force the withdrawal of Serbian mili- tary and paramilitary forces and to re- store Kosovars to their homes. /ballot1845 Mr. Speaker, I would like to enter into the R ECORD the Kosova Coalition, which is signed by many, many people, Christians, Muslims, Jews, all kinds of ethnic groups in this country to Mem- bers of Congress urging our support for NATO's efforts to stop the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. One paragraph says, ``We, therefore, call on Congress to request that it take all necessary steps to end Serbia's campaign of eth- nic cleansing, force the withdrawal of all Serb forces, create a secure environ- ment for the return of Albanians to their homes, and allow them to govern themselves and to rebuild Kosovo.'' Finally, I want to say that the smears that have been leveled in some quarters against the KLA talking about them using drug money and whatever have no basis in fact. Intel- ligence reports and everybody else say that it is nothing but a political smear campaign, and again today in the Wall Street Journal it says, The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency says claims that the KLA raises money from drugs quote, ``have not been corroborated and may be politically motivated.'' So I am tired of the smears. This country is doing the right thing, the noble thing. We are to make sure that the Kosovar Albanians get their legiti- mate rights. We are to stay the course; we are to be firm, and I am proud of the United States of America standing up at this very important point in time. I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. APRIL 20, 1999. The P RESIDENT , The White House, Washington, DC. DEARMR. PRESIDENT : The Veterans of For- eign Wars of the Untied States is gravely concerned about the worsening situation in the Balkans. As the combat veterans who for the last 100 years have fought all of our country's wars, we have until now opposed the deployment of U.S. forces to the former Yugoslavia. Our opposition was based on our concern for the safety of our servicemen and women in the midst of the Yugoslav civil war. Also, we have been uncertain what vital U.S. national security interests were at stake in that country's conflict. Since we took that position, however, the situation has changed. In the past few weeks Serbian leaders have used their military andCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3455 May 20, 1999 paramilitary forces to overrun Kosovo, de- stroy the social and economic fabric of the province and terrorize the populace into flight. Despite, and in defiance of NATO's diplo- matic efforts and its air campaign, Serbia now has achieved its objectives in Kosovo. By doing so it has raised the stakes in this conflict. Having waged unrestricted war on the people and province of Kosovo, NATO's credibility and U.S. leadership have been di- rectly challenged by Serbia. NATO will nei- ther continue as a credible, unified alliance, nor will the U.S. retain its world leadership role if the Serbian challenge goes unmet and Serb aggression is not stopped. Many of our members are deeply troubled by the situation we face. Some realize the long history of this conflict, the skill of our adversaries, the inhospitable weather and terrain and the political difficulty of main- taining alliance unity are important factors that will affect our actions and their out- comes. Others are mindful of the lessons of past wars. The gradual applications of force that allow adversaries to seize objectives be- fore our power peaks and the limits placed on the use of our military power which can prolong conflicts, increase casualties and erode public support are lessons that seem to some to apply equally to today as to yester- day. Nonetheless, in consideration of the cur- rent situation, the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States is resolved that in order to bring this conflict to a rapid and success- ful conclusion on terms favorable to NATO, we will support the United States acting as part of the NATO alliance, taking decisive action with the full range of overwhelming military power to eject, remove or otherwise force the withdrawal of Serbian military and paramilitary forces and to restore Kosovars to their homes. We also believe that careful consideration should be given to the formation of a NATO peacekeeping force to guarantee Kosovars' freedom from further oppression and the right to its self-determination. Finally, Mr. President, with such impor- tant questions before us we believe and urge you to ensure first that the American people are behind this effort and then to take this issue to the United States Congress for its advice and consent. Sincerely, THOMAS A. P OULIOT , Commander-in-Chief, Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States. KOSOVA COALITION , Washington, DC, May 19, 1999. DEARMEMBER OF CONGRESS : We are writing to urge your support for NATO's efforts to stop the ethnic cleansing of Kosova. We are horrified by the atrocities, includ- ing mass murder, systematic rape, and wide- spread expulsions, committed by Serb forces against the civilian population of Kosova. We strongly support NATO's military cam- paign in Kosova, but are concerned that our efforts thus far have not been enough to stop the atrocities there. In fact, the State De- partment recently reported that Serbia has forced nearly 90 percent of the Kosovar Alba- nians from their homes and is continuing its effort to cleanse Kosova of its Albanian pop- ulation. We cannot allow Serbia to succeed. We, therefore, call on Congress to request that NATO take all necessary steps to end Serbia's campaign of ethnic cleansing, force the withdrawal of all Serb forces, create a se- cure environment for the return of the Alba- nians to their homes, and allow them to gov- ern themselves and rebuild Kosova. We also support the efforts of the UN War Crimes Tribunal. We strongly believe that those individuals who committed or orderedothers to commit crimes against humanity must be brought to justice. Lastly, we believe that the international community should continue to help alleviate the circumstances facing the Kosovar refu- gees. To the extent possible, the refugees should be able to remain in the Balkans to better enable their eventual return to their homes. All countries bordering Kosova should keep their borders open to refugees and treat them with dignity and respect. Although we are disheartened by the events unfolding in Kosova, we are sup- portive of NATO's mission there. But the ethnic cleansing must stop. NATO can help achieve that goal by expanding its mission in Kosova. Sincerely, Ilir Zherka, National Albanian American Council; Bruce Morrison, Former Mem- ber of Congress; Richard D. Heidman, B'nai B'rith Ruga, Friends of Bosnia; John Cavelli, Con- ference of Presidents of Major Italian American Organizations; Hisham Reda, Muslim Public Affairs Committee; Marilyn Federation of Croatian Amer- Bob Blancato, Italian American Democratic Federation of Polish Americans; Abdulrahman Alamoudi, American Muslim Council Foundation, John Pikarski,* Gordon and Pikarski; Rabbi David Saperstein, Religious Action Center of Reform Judiasm; Dr. Jim Zogby,* Arab American Institute; Ste- ven Schwarz, Jewish Council for Public Affairs; Tolga Cubukcu, Assembly of Turkish American Associations; Phil Baum, American Jewish Congress; Peter Ujvagi, Hungarian American Na- tional Democratic Leadership Caucus; Jason Isaacson, American Jewish Com- mittee. *These individuals are signing the letter in their own names. Organizations they rep- resent are included for information purposes only. Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for coming down and sharing his concerns. I know the gentleman from Virginia would like to speak on school violence, and I would like to yield to him at this point in time. Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speak- er, I thank the gentleman from Michi- gan for yielding to me. I also want to say a word about the comments of the gentleman from New York (Mr. E NGEL ), my friend and colleague. He is abso- lutely right. Mr. Milosevic is a war criminal and he is a bully, and we can- not yield to him. We must not let him prevail, nor can we as a society ever become apathetic to the suffering, the murder, the genocidal campaign that has gone on in the Balkans. We must stand firm; we must stand with NATO, and that means whether it is politi- cally popular, or whether it is not the popular will, it is up to us to show leadership. The President is showing leadership. Most of the leaders of NATO are showing leadership, particu- larly in the United Kingdom, and we applaud them for doing that. History will give them credit if they do not get it from their electorate today. As we approach the dawn of a new millennium, we as a people, individ-ually and collectively, must stand up for a civil society, a society under the rule of law, a society where democracy determines leadership, a society where people are rewarded for their effort within a capitalist economy. So we have a major role internation- ally. But we must also set a standard domestically, and there is an area where this society falls short of meet- ing that standard, and that is in the area of gun control. Because the statis- tics will show that that is one area where we trailed the rest of the indus- trialized nations. In fact, there are more children killed by firearms in the United States than all 25 other indus- trialized nations combined. Now, when we stand for principle internationally, it would seem that it is incumbent upon us to do the right thing domestically, and it is not right that 13 young people every day lose their lives due to firearms, whether it be through homicides, suicides, or un- intentional shooting. Mr. Speaker, there are events such as happened today, such as happened re- cently in Littleton, Colorado where that enters the radar screen of our mind. But it should be an objective every day, particularly in this House, to bring us in line with the other civ- ilized nations and to stop the prolifera- tion of handguns and assault weapons. The last year for which we have sta- tistics, we know that about 3,000 chil- dren and teenagers were murdered with guns, over 1,300 committed suicide with guns, and about 500 died in uninten- tional shootings, just in one year. A total of nearly 5,000 young people were killed by firearms, and that is a rel- atively typical year. In fact, in a typ- ical year, we have over 20,000 people, adults and children alike, killed by firearms. That is way out of sync with the rest of the civilized world. There is no country that even registers on the same radar screen as the United States. They do not reach 100 deaths by firearms in a year, and we have 23,000. Mr. Speaker, two in 25 high school students, so we are talking about tens and tens of thousands of high school students, report having carried a gun in the last month. Where are they get- ting these guns? Why are they getting these guns? They are getting these guns because we have lax laws, because of our gun control policy which is too determined by politics and by political campaign contributions. I speak particularly of the gun lobby and of contributions from the National Rifle Association. If the Republican Party does not want this to be a cam- paign issue, if they do not want this to be a partisan issue, then they should not be accepting the millions of dollars of campaign contributions from the National Rifle Association. Because it is going to be a campaign issue when 85 percent of those campaign contribu- tions are going to Republicans, when one can go right down the line of the people who lead the fight against gunCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3456 May 20, 1999 control, and look at the campaign con- tributions, and most of them have got- ten $9,900 a year. Some have gotten as much as $14,000. I do not know how they do that, because they are sup- posed to be limited to $10,000 a year, maximum. But we have the numbers. The numbers are available. People should look at it. People should com- pare those to votes. People should also respect the fact that an important vote was cast today. It was a deadlock, it was decided by the Vice President of the United States, and it was the right thing to do. I hope that this will not continue to be a partisan issue, that we will do the right thing in the House of Representa- tives. That, in fact, we will be able to add the same amendments to the Juve- nile Justice Authorization, and lacking those amendments, that we will be able to at least add them to the appropria- tions bill on Treasury and Postal Oper- ations. It is long past time. Thousands of people have died because we have not been willing to stand up to the kind of political bullying that comes from many in the gun lobby. Mr. Speaker, we should not miss this opportunity to focus on this very seri- ous problem in our society. We must start to do the right thing legisla- tively. We must stop this violence. I am not suggesting that to take away guns is a magic bullet. But I am sug- gesting that when we went to school, we had the same kind of psychological problems with peers and girlfriends and so on, but we did not have dead victims as a result. We might have done silly things, but gosh, we did not have ac- cess to guns; we did not shoot people, we did not leave people dead in a pool of blood. And that is happening because guns are much to easily accessible to our young people who do not have the maturity to be able to use them. We ought to increase the age of accessi- bility to guns, we ought to put safety locks on guns, and we ought to reduce the proliferation of them, whether it be through pawnshops or through gun shows or retail or wholesale or what- ever. The time has long since passed for us to take the lead in this very seri- ous issue and restore a civil society and reduce the violence that is preva- lent throughout this American Nation. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gen- tleman from Michigan taking this time to speak about school violence. School violence is a reflection of society. This is an important issue. We ought to be addressing it today. Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, realizing my time has expired, I once again would just like to thank the Speaker for his courtesies here tonight and un- derstand that of course that as we ad- dress this issue, it is more than just guns, but things are happening in com- munities, in schools and in homes, and we invite Democrats and Republicans to come together and address this in a bipartisan mannerA GREATER QUALITY OF LIFE FOR AMERICA'S DEFENDERS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of Jan- uary 6, 1999, the gentlewoman from Idaho (Mrs. C HENOWETH ) is recognized for 60 minutes. Mrs. CHENOWETH. Mr. Speaker, I found it interesting, the comments to- night on Kosovo. It is my firm belief that we are involved in an illegal war. We speak glowingly about the rule of law, and yet the Constitution requires that the Congress raise up armies and declare war. The War Powers Act clear- ly defines the limits within which the President may engage in war-like ac- tivities such as we have become in- volved in in Kosovo. The U.N. charter requires that no Nation see this kind of violent activity in a sovereign manner when there is internal conflict. So I do not care where one looks, whether it is international law, constitutional law, or statutory authority, this is an ille- gal war. As we think about the war in Kosovo, Mr. Speaker, I want us today, as we begin to approach the time when we re- member the veterans, the men and women who have served so bravely overseas, as we begin to enter into that season in our year, I want us to think about them and not forget them. Be- cause in today's military, a young en- listed person serving out his or her first contract can expect to make only $1,075.80 a month. Over a 40-hour work week, this averages to $6.70 an hour. But most of our military personnel do not work 40-hour work weeks. We all remember the famous army slogan: We do more before 9 o'clock a.m. than most people do all day. Well, Mr. Speaker, it is true. These young en- listed personnel can expect to be at work before first light and not home again until long after dark. /ballot1900 Mr. Speaker, we do not pay them overtime. These young people train for weeks at a time away from home. They keep themselves in a state of top phys- ical readiness, and they live their per- sonal lives according to the high stand- ards of integrity and honor we mandate for them. These young servicemen and women must uproot their families on a moment's notice, moving to a new duty station across the country or across the globe. A lot of them do it for as lit- tle as $6.70 an hour. For members of the military with families, the situation is even worse. Despite a modest living allowance, 12,000 families currently serving our armed forces are dependent upon food stamps, food stamps. We have govern- ment employees living off of govern- ment subsidies. Mr. Speaker, why do we not skip the intermediary step and just pay them properly in the first place? During the holidays at the Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho, a net- work of military spouses work together to collect donations of money and toysfor the enlisted families who cannot af- ford to give their young ones Christ- mas or Thanksgiving. Last November and December, the Mountain Home Warm Heart organiza- tion, run by the spouses of servicemen, distributed over $18,000 worth of food and toys and cash to needy military families. Where did this money come from, Mr. Speaker? From the pockets of service- men who already had very little to give. If this were not bad enough, many military families have more serious concerns than just Christmas and Thanksgiving. At the Mountain Home Air Force Base, 459 women and children are re- ceiving regular food assistance. That is not a proud record for us. One hundred and seven of those are infants. The Mountain Home Air Force Aid Society made $131,000 in emergency assistance loans to military families. I am very concerned about what will happen to these families when the money runs out and they still have to make month- ly payments on their loans. In the 18th century, citizen soldiers won our independence and secured our liberties. We hailed them as heroes, and revered the courage and commit- ment they demonstrated in defense of our Nation. Today that Nation is pro- tected by citizen soldiers with the same integrity and that same sense of duty. Only in 20th century America, we do not even pay them a living wage. We should be ashamed of ourselves. From 1988 to today, there have been 32 deployments of our military. In the previous 60 years, there were only 10 deployments. Put another way, Mr. Speaker, prior to this administration, the military was deployed an average of once every 6 years. During the Clin- ton administration, the military has been deployed an average of four times every year. Furthermore, since 1987 we have de- pleted our ranks by 800,000 servicemen, 800,000 servicemen. In practical terms, that translates into more frequent de- ployments and dangerously long hours. It is illegal in this country for truck drivers to be on the road longer than 8 consecutive hours without rest. We have pilots now patrolling the Medi- terranean in 14-hour shifts. In short, this administration is ex- pecting our servicemen and women to do 100 times as much and place their lives at risk 100 times as often with 800,000 fewer people for as little as $6.70 an hour. Mr. Speaker, I recently paid a plumb- er $90 an hour to unplug my garbage disposal. An auto mechanic can expect $50 an hour. A teenage person working as a bagger in a grocery store can earn up to $12 an hour. None of these jobs re- quires 24-hour dedication to duty and a constant threat to their lives. Mr. Speaker, one young Marine I know of has taken a second job to sup- plement his income. Every night this Lance Corporal goes home and trades his Marine uniform for a blue and redCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H3457 May 20, 1999 tee shirt and matching hat from Dom- inoes. This young Marine, this hard- working father of two, delivers pizza because he is too proud to accept wel- fare. He is not alone in this endeavor, but it is nearly impossible to know how many young servicemen are in this po- sition, because most of them hide it from their commanders. A young Lance Corporal serving in the Marine Corps today can anticipate being combat-deployed at least once in a 4-year enlistment. I wonder what this Lance Corporal's family will do when he is away and they have to make do without the supplemental income from Dominoes? I am humbled by this young Marine, and many others like him who work so hard to protect us. I am ashamed that we do not do right by them. I urge this body to seriously consider the ethics of our government's contin- ued overextension of our military in light of our complete lack of gratitude for their service. Mr. Speaker, I have a request to make of the Members of this body. To- night, when they go home to their fam- ilies and when we go to the security and comfort of our own homes, when we tuck our young children in bed and say a prayer, we need to say a prayer for the men and women of our armed forces. As we sleep, approximately 100,000 of them stand watch away from their own loved ones, ready to give their very lives to protect us, for as little as $6.70 an hour. Mr. Speaker, I think this Congress must begin to understand that there is a direct correlation between the effec- tiveness of active duty military today and the treatment of the veterans of yesterday's service. Retention, morale, readiness, these words are euphemisms used to disguise the real problem our military faces: A complete lack of faith that their government will take good care of them. Why should our active duty service- men believe us? Veterans in my dis- trict are feeling the effects of cuts in the veterans budgets. Veterans hos- pitals in Salt Lake City and Spokane are suffering from cutbacks and layoffs which impact patient care, as well as those hospitals, veterans hospitals, in Boise, Idaho. There are waiting lists for surgery and fewer options for long- term care. We have broken our prom- ises. A sign in front of the Boise Veterans' Medical Center reads ``The price of freedom is visible here.'' But indeed, it is. Unfortunately, in our society, a se- lect few pay that price. They are our veterans. They are our heroes, and they must fight for the health care benefits that we promised them. We expected our veterans to fight for us abroad, but it breaks my heart when they have to come home and fight for their privileges that were promised them at home. Mr. Speaker, veterans are forced into one final choice between their homeand their patriotism. No Idaho veteran may be laid to rest in his home State in a dedicated field of honor. That is because my home State is the only State in the Union which does not have a veterans cemetery. Veterans represent approximately 10 percent of Idaho's population. There are nearly 100,000 combat veterans in Idaho, about a third of whom served our Nation in World War II. Our aver- age World War II veteran is 76 years old. These heroes are now passing away. This summer when veterans or- ganizations call the roll of those who have died in the last year, they will read 3,500 names in Idaho, and not one will be able to be buried in an Idaho veterans cemetery. There is not an Idaho veterans cemetery. That is why I am introducing legisla- tion which will provide Idaho with a veterans cemetery. This bill answers a critical need Idaho faces. In pressing for a veterans' cemetery, I have the support of the entire Idaho congres- sional delegation, the State veterans organizations, our Governor, the Idaho legislature, and the chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. S TUMP ). In fact, last month, the Idaho legisla- ture passed Joint Memorial No. 1, which urgently requested a veterans cemetery, stating, and I quote, ``It is fitting and proper that a grateful Na- tion should provide a burial site within a reasonable distance from the homes of those Idahoans and others residing in the northwestern States who honor- ably served their country in a time of emergency.'' Mr. Speaker, I do not believe this case can be overstated. We in this body must begin to take very seriously our commitment to the armed forces. We cannot just try to make piecemeal re- pairs. We must begin to demonstrate a genuine commitment to improve the quality of life for our veterans and our active duty servicemen and women. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week I was forced to vote no on the Kosovo emer- gency supplemental. That was a very painful and difficult vote for me. On the one hand, I hate to pass up a chance to rectify the wrongs brought down on our military in the past 6 years. I always welcome the chance to give something back to our servicemen, but I cannot fund an illegal war. I cannot condone this military action, this ter- rible descent into a protracted conflict in which the American people have no stake whatsoever. I care about our troops too much to remain silent as they are led to this battlefield. Mr. Speaker, last month this body had the opportunity to fulfill its con- stitutional role and declare war on the people of Kosovo. All but two, all but two 2 Members balked from that final act. It seems that the only thing this body can agree on in this matter is that the people of Kosovo are not our enemies. Why, then, are we bombing them? Why are we destroying their capital?I do not understand the answer to this question, Mr. Speaker, and I can- not let the temptation to provide our servicemen their due at this time dis- suade me from my obligation to pre- serve, protect, and defend the Constitu- tion. Had I voted to fund the war I had voted against declaring, I would have compromised the very principles these young people have fought for in the past. I would have voted to violate the Constitution. Worse, Mr. Speaker, this supplemental amounted to nothing less than blackmail. The Members of this body were offered a choice: Support the troops and the beluga whale and the House pages and the University of the District of Columbia and Washington Metropolitan Air Traffic and whatever other random provision was added, or do not support the troops at all. It is a shameful situation, what was added to the so-called emergency supplemental. It is a testament to the way the mili- tary has been constantly used by us, improperly used. The fact is our military is being at- tacked by its most dangerous oppo- nent, our own civilian command. This Kosovo supplemental was proof that we are not committed enough as a govern- ment or powerful enough as a Congress to undo the damage that already has been done. It is time to move from piecemeal repairs after the fact to proper recognition, support, and honor throughout. In a time when we were threatened, they defended us. In a time when we were afraid, they kept their courage. In a time when we have discarded patriot- ism, they still salute their flag, honor their Commander in Chief, and serve the ideals of American freedom. Mr. Speaker, we must show them, our heroes of past conflict and those who stand guard as we speak, that we care, that we are grateful, that we will not fail them. /fdash LEAVE OF ABSENCE By unanimous consent, leave of ab- sence was granted to: Mr. D EUTSCH (at the request of Mr. GEPHARDT ) for after 3:00 p.m. today on account of personal reasons.

The PRESIDENT pro tempore. To- day's prayer will be offered by our guest Chaplain, Rabbi Moshe Feller, Upper Midwest Regional Director of the World Lubavitch Movement, St. Paul, MN. We are pleased to have you with us. PRAYER The guest Chaplain, Rabbi Moshe Feller, Upper Midwest Chabad Lubavitch, offered the following prayer: Almighty God and God of our fathers, sovereign Ruler of the universe and all mankind, tomorrow we mark Your bib-lical holiday\u2014the Festival of Weeks. On this day 3,311 years ago, You de-scended on Mount Sinai and gave the Ten Commandments amidst ''thunder and lightning and the powerful sound of the ram's horn.'' Before issuing Your Commandments, the most crucial of which are: Thou shalt awesomely declared, ''I am God, your God.'' You declared so be-cause, in Your infinite wisdom, You knew that only by constantly focusing on Your sovereignty could humans con-trol their negative impulses. Almighty God, this august institu- tion, the Senate of the United States of America, responds daily to Your dec-laration at Sinai by opening their con-vocations in this historic and noble Chamber with the recognition of Your sovereign presence and by publicly of-fering prayers to You. Reward this sacred practice by grant- ing the Senators good health, good cheer, good fellowship, long life, and abundant wisdom. May this wise and sacred practice be an inspiration to all convocations and assemblies which are convened daily throughout our blessed country and throughout the world to do likewise, in light of today's event in the school in Georgia, especially in the Nation's public schools, so that mor-tality, safety, tranquility, and happi-ness prevail throughout our country and throughout the world. Amen. f RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The able chairman of the Judiciary Com-mittee is recognized. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank the President pro tempore. f SCHEDULE Mr. HATCH. This morning the Sen- ate will resume debate on the juvenile justice bill. Under a previous order, the Senate will begin 60 minutes of debate on the Smith and Lautenberg pawn-shop amendments. Following that de-bate, at approximately 10:30, votes on or in relation to the amendments will occur. Additional amendments are ex-pected, and therefore votes will occur throughout the day and into the evening. In addition, consideration of the sup- plemental appropriations bill will begin today. It is hoped that a time agreement on this legislation will be made and a vote on final passage will also take place today. I thank my colleagues for their at- tention.

Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk and ask unan-imous consent that the Smith amend-ment be modified. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have no objection to the modification. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment (No. 366), as modi- fied, is as follows: At the end of the act, insert the following: SEC. . PROVISIONS RELATING TO PAWN SHOPS AND SPECIAL LICENSEES. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the repeal heretofore effected by paragraph (1) and the amendment heretofore effected by paragraph (2) of subsection (c) with the heading ''Provision Related to Pawn and Other Transactions'' of section 4 of the title with the heading ''General Firearms Provisions'' shall be null and void.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will withhold. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this is an important day because this is the day on which we hope we can finally pass this juvenile justice bill. We have had another shooting of students just today at a high school in Georgia. The shoot-ing occurred at 8 a.m. at the Heritage High School and a number of children were wounded. I won't go into the de-tails, but the shooting was exactly a month after the April 20 slaughter at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, where two students killed 13 people before taking their own lives. It is apparent that we have to do something about this, and this bill is a very considered attempt to do exactly that. Now, we are going to have two very crucial amendments this morning. The Smith amendment is first to come up, and this amendment is to resolve the pawn shop issue and the special li-censee issue. I commend the distin-guished Senator from Oregon and the distinguished Senator from Vermont in particular for their thoughtfulness in trying to resolve this difficulty. We want to do this in a bipartisan way. I surely hope people quit trying to score political points and help to get this bill done. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, look where we are today\u2014another high school shooting incident in Atlanta, four young people, at least in the ini-tial news, injured, not killed. I talked about it with the Attorney General a few minutes ago. She had expressed her concern. I also commended her for her strong words of last week because I be-lieve that helped move this bill for-ward. We are considering it during the eighth legislative day. We have not spent full days on this important bill. We will not be able to spend a full day. Notwithstanding that, we have made significant progress. Today, we will also consider the long- delayed emergency supplemental ap-propriations bill to provide relief for victims of Hurricane Mitch, humani-tarian aid in the Balkans, aid for farm-ers, and aid for the victims of natural disasters, as well as military and other appropriations. In the time available to us today, I do hope we will be able to move to final passage on this bill. The bill has been much improved since its predecessor was introduced 2 years ago as S. 10. I detailed some of those improvements yesterday, and yesterday the Senate took a giant step forward with the adoption of the managers', the Hatch- Leahy amendment. Those modifica-tions go a long way toward improving the bill. I predicted all week long that once we adopted Hatch-Leahy, we would have fewer than 10 amendments offered from the Democratic side. As we begin this morning, I am sure of that. I am working with other Democratic Senators to see if the num-ber of amendments can be reduced even further. Thanks to the hard work of Senator R EIDand others, the Demo- cratic amendments have been pared down from 89 to a precious few left to be offered. They are still pending; they are still to be offered. I am hoping, though, that none will pose a stum-bling block. I know that in a little while the President of the United States will travel to Colorado for events in connec-tion with remembering and honoring those who perished in Littleton, CO, re-cently as a result of school violence. I hope the visit from the President will help heal the wounds and ease the suf-fering. He is right to go to Colorado, just as he went to Oklahoma and has gone to the side of other Americans in other places where tragedy has struck over the last several years. I had hoped that perhaps the chairman of the Judi-ciary Committee and I could place a joint call to the President before he leaves Colorado this afternoon to tell him the Senate is doing its job, the Senate has completed its initial work on the juvenile crime bill, and the Sen-ate is sending the bill to the House for its prompt consideration. I would like for the President to be able to share that news with the people of Colorado and the Nation so that parents and youngsters everywhere can be reas-sured we are making progress in our work and that the Senate of the United States is acting as the conscience of the Nation. There is one set of amendments that still threatens final passage of this bill. The Frist-Ashcroft amendment, which proposes modification of IDEA, is a matter of significant controversy and turmoil. Because that amendment threatens completion of the bill, I made a series of suggestions over the last couple of days in an effort to try to avoid that risk to the underlying measure. We need the cooperation of the Republican sponsors of that amend-ment if we are to complete our work on the juvenile bill today. We are also working our way through a series of gun-related proposals to the bill. Last week, the Senate adopted a pattern of tabling Democratic amend-ments one day, and the next day it adopted pieces of those amendments if they were offered by Republicans. I suppose I should be glad to see our amendments finally get in one way or the other, but it is petty to say the amendments aren't worth anything if they are offered by Democrats, but they are wonderful if the same amend-ment is offered by a Republican. We have to do better. This should be a bi-partisan bill. Unquestionably, the Senate hit a real snag on this bill when it rejected, on a virtual party-line vote, the Lautenberg amendment. They didn't solve the first Craig amendment and Hatch-Craig II, seeking to reconstitute the ill-advised initial votes on the gun show issue. Senator S CHUMER and I tried to point out problems with the Craig amend-ment, only to be told we were wrong last Wednesday night. In fact, we were told in fairly scathing terms how wrong we were. Of course, the next morning after the press looked at it, and after the Senate adopted the ini-tial Craig amendment, it was clear to almost all throughout the country that mistakes had been made, the Senator from New York and I were correct, and matters needed to be fixed. So we saw another partial fix. Today, we will see yet a third Repub- lican amendment seeking to rectify what the Senate did when it rejected the Lautenberg amendment in favor of the Craig amendment last week. The Smith-Jeffords amendment is the most recent Republican amendment in that series of Republican amendments mak-ing corrections. As President Reagan said in another context, ''There you go again.'' Unfortunately, the Smith-Jef-fords amendment closes only 2 of the 13 loopholes created by adoption of the Craig and the Hatch-Craig amendment. The Smith-Jeffords amendment is baby steps toward background checks. That is what it is, baby steps toward background checks. It closes one loop-hole by requiring special licensees under Hatch-Craig to conduct back-ground checks on firearm sales at gun shows. It closes the pawnshop loophole by repealing the Hatch-Craig amend-ment provision that allowed criminals to redeem guns at pawnshops without background checks\u2014the same loophole adopted by the Senate last week. The Smith-Jeffords amendment still leaves 11 loopholes that were created by adoption of the Craig and Hatch- Craig amendment of last week. The Smith-Jeffords amendment does not close the legal immunity loophole cre-ated by the Craig and Hatch-Craig amendments. Those amendments dis-miss pending lawsuits against some gun dealers and perhaps even gun man-ufacturers. Giving gun dealers and manufacturers a get-out-of-jail-free card is wrong. The Smith-Jeffords amendment does not close the loophole that weakens all background checks at gun shows by giving law enforcement only 24 hours to complete the checks. Most gun shows take place on weekends when courthouses and record departments are closed. Law enforcement may well need the full 3 days to do the job right. Now, at the rate of the Smith-Jef- fords amendment on closing only 2 of the 13 gun show loopholes\u2014the ones the Republicans voted for last week\u2014 by closing only 2 of the 13 gun show loopholes at a time, I believe the Re-publican majority will need to offer 6.5 more amendments to finally fix all the VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5635 May 20, 1999 problems in the amendments they adopted last week. The Senate does not have the luxury of time to follow the ''baby steps toward the background checks'' approach. Fortunately, Senators L AUTENBERG and K ERREY are offering the Senate an- other chance to right this matter by adoption of the modified version of the Lautenberg amendment this morning. The Lautenberg and Kerrey amend-ment closes all 13 gun show loopholes. I hope we will finally step past party labels and close all 13 loopholes. If we hear that we have already voted on this matter, be careful. We did. It was tabled. But didn't we find after that more loopholes were opened up? We have to come back. Let's close the loopholes once and for all. After all, the Senator from New Jersey should be commended for offering the Senate a second chance to do the right thing. We have had three amendments on the subject from the other side, first opening huge loopholes, and now\u2014and I commend Senator S MITH for trying to close the same loopholes that he voted for last week. I hope that all Members will step back from the heat of the de-bate and vote on the merits of these proposals. They can be corrected today. The way to do that is to vote for the Lautenberg-Kerrey amendment and close all the loopholes\u2014not the baby steps but the one giant step. Let's not keep coming back, and let's not be in a position we seem to put ourselves in. We open up huge loop-holes, the American public reacts with great unanimity against those loop-holes, and then we come back and say let's close a few and wait and see what the reaction is. Let's do what the American people are saying: Close all the loopholes. I retain the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Vermont. Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the vote we are about to take is about compromise. It is an attempt to try to get a bipartisan bill. It is about finding common ground to resolve an issue vital to the Nation. We should join to-gether and show the American people that it is in a bipartisan manner that the Senate can responsibly deal with the issue of guns. As a Senator who voted for the Brady bill, I understand the importance of background checks. I understand the need to keep firearms from felons. I have long supported the concept of background checks at gun shows. This amendment mandates that every gun transaction at a gun show must include a background check, pe-riod. There are no loopholes. This is not a smokescreen. This is strict lan-guage, strong language, that will force gun sellers and purchasers to follow re-sponsible actions in trading and selling guns. The system we created with this amendment mandates that people pur-chase firearms legally and, therefore, go through the background check. It is time to tell gun owners and buyers to be responsible. It is time to show the Nation that we understand their con-cerns and we are acting. The tragic shooting at Littleton and today in Atlanta further demonstrates the need for both sides to come to-gether and to work on this issue to find a common solution to the escalating level of school violence. The amendment Senator S MITH and I are offering will help ensure that time-ly background checks are performed on a purchase of firearms at gun shows. The Smith-Jeffords amendment should bring this Senate together with the common goal of any illegal firearm sales. The amendment is a bold, bipar-tisan step and should be adopted. Now is the time for action. Now is the time for reason to prevail over rhetoric. Now is the time to show our Nation's par-ents that we can get together and end this senseless violence. I yield the floor. Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise first to thank the cosponsor of this amendment, Senator J EFFORDS ; and also Senator M CCAIN, who was in- strumental in helping me and others to bring attention to the need to get a bill we can be proud of and that actually works. Second, I extend my condolences, my thoughts, my prayers to the people of Atlanta. I know whereof they suffer this terrible day. It was a year ago, and a few days, that Oregon, in Springfield, at Thurston High School, suffered a similar tragedy. Now we must add At-lanta to the roll of Littleton and Springfield and Jonesboro and Paducah and many other places. We stand here today as elected rep- resentatives of the people of the United States, to try to do right by them. But too often in this Chamber the focus seems to suggest there is only one an-swer and that answer is to go after guns. But the problem is so much deep-er than that. I am willing to admit there are things we can do, and things we are doing now, that will separate law-abiding citizens and gun owners from the fanatics and the kooks and the criminals, the dangerous and the deranged in our society. We do not want them to have guns. We do not want obtaining guns to be easy for them. But we want to construct a sys-tem that encourages the law abiding to come and participate in an instant check, a system that encourages, that incentivizes, and does not just regulate and drive things into the back alley and into the parking lot. The amendment that Senator J EF- FORDS and I offer today does two very simple things. We do close the pawn-shop loophole. We use the very lan-guage of my colleague and friend from New York, Senator S CHUMER , to go back to current ATF regulation to make sure if someone comes in and hocks his gun he cannot then go, com-mit a felony, and then retrieve that gun without a background check. I have no intention of leaving that loop-hole open. We are going to close it today. Second, because there is a dispute as to the Hatch-Craig language in terms of licensees, we are clarifying that. We are saying simply those in the new Federal firearms dealer category of a ''special licensee'' must comply with all dealer provisions of the Gun Control Act and always do a background check with no exceptions. This morning we have heard there are apparently 13 additional loopholes. Let me suggest the difference between our amendment and theirs. What our amendment does is incentivize. What their amendment does is regulate. The special licensee, if he obeys the law, comes in and is entitled to an instant check, access to the instant check sys-tem. He is not charged a fee, because we are not interested in increasing taxes here. He is immune from civil li-ability and fines of up to $10,000 and 5 years in prison. We are trying to get people to understand we want them to come in. We do not want to drive them into the back alley and into the park-ing lot and into the street. We want them to come in, in the light of day, because they are proud of their second amendment rights, and will protect their second amendment rights through instant check. Let me tell you what else we do. There is a huge difference between this amendment and the one my friend from New Jersey is proposing. He is allowing for 72-hour checks. If it takes 72 hours to get a background check, it is not an instant check. If you have ever been pulled over for a traffic violation, you know the policeman will check your car, check your license, check your registration, and he will find out if there is any additional reason, other than a traffic violation, to hold you. We have instant check now. Why do we not make instant check available to people who are exercising their second amendment rights? I want to be real clear: 72 hours is not an instant. We are going down to 24 hours because we want to incentivize this Government to finally go to work and produce instant check, make it available. One of the most appalling revelations to come out of the tragedies of Little-ton is that gun laws are not prosecuted by this administration. We can pass all the laws in the world on guns but if they are not enforced they are of little value to this country. So, where it makes sense to add, we are adding. But we call on the administration also to enforce. If we enforce our laws, we will begin to make them efficacious; we will begin to change conduct. But there is an important additional reason for supporting this amendment versus that of the Senators from New Jersey. Many States, as we speak, my own included, are debating the issue of gun shows, are debating the issue of in-stant check. You and I know very well that law enforcement takes place where crimes occur, at the local level. There are Governors and legislators VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5636 May 20, 1999 who are working with gun advocates, gun opponents, and police forces who are trying to come up with definitions that will work for their States and their localities. That is happening as we are talking. It is happening in my State. If we go to Senator L AUTEN - BERG 's definition, all we would do is nullify much of the work that has al-ready been done and has been passed into law. I am saying we should not do that. Because law enforcement, while we have a role, will remain primarily a local concern because it is locally ad-ministered. So I would like to trust the States, to leave them some room, some discre-tion to fix this problem on their terms, in ways that work in their commu-nities. We cannot know it all here, even though we too often pretend to. So, if you care about the issue of States rights and law enforcement, Smith-Jeffords is the way to vote. If you want Washington to dictate every principle and every definition, then Senator L AUTENBERG 's approach is the way to do it. There is another reason. I talked about incentives. I congratulate the Senator from New Jersey. His amend-ment today is much better than the one I proudly voted against on Wednes-day night. That one made sure taxes were raised, Government bureaucracies were built, and everybody in sight got sued. What we are trying to do is not raise taxes, not grow Government, and to provide some immunity, therefore some incentives to get people to com-ply with these laws. We call upon this administration to enforce these laws. I hope my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, will vote for this amend-ment. We are using Senator S CHUMER 's language. I thank him for that. It works. It clarifies. It ties it up. But if you try to tighten every loophole you see, I promise you the effect of your work today will be to create a black market, an underground, a back alley business, a parking lot exchange. I want them to come inside. Because second amendment rights do come with second amendment respon-sibilities, let's make it easier; let's not make it harder. We are doing this in this amendment. We are applying in-stant check, we are trusting the States, and we are not growing Govern-ment. We are protecting kids in the schools, we are protecting the second amendment right to bear arms, we are protecting law-abiding citizens, and we are getting after the kooks and the criminals, the deranged and the dan-gerous who haunt our society, to make sure this is not a huge loophole that will give them access to dangerous weaponry. I encourage my colleagues to vote for this amendment and vote against the Lautenberg amendment. It is too much and it will drive this issue into the back alley. Mr. SCHUMER addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from New York? Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield my remaining 5 minutes\u2014I believe I have 5 minutes\u2014to the Senator from New York. He is going to speak right before the Senator from New Jersey who, under the original order, is guar-anteed time in any event. Mr. SCHUMER. I now, in the 5 min- utes yielded to me generously by the Senator from Vermont\u2014I believe I have 20 minutes. I will speak for 10\u2014I will control 10 and yield 10 to the Sen-ator. Mr. LAUTENBERG. To be sure, the Parliamentarian may be able to tell us. How much time will we have on the Smith and Lautenberg amendments combined? Mr. SCHUMER. I believe there are 20 minutes left, Mr. President. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The mi- nority has 20 minutes total. The major-ity has 15 minutes 58 seconds. Mr. LAUTENBERG. And the Senator yields\u2014\u2014 Mr. SCHUMER. I will be yielding 10 minutes to the Senator from New Jer-sey. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from New York. Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, this morning while we are compromising with the gun lobby, ambulances are rushing to Heritage High School to save children from an-other shooting. It is profoundly dis-heartening. How much longer are we going to embrace the gun lobby instead of the mothers and fathers of America? Why are we compromising on such sim-ple issues? It should not have taken us a week to come to the view that we should close the gun show loophole. It never should have been opened, and it now should be closed, and it should be closed cleanly and simply by passing the amendment of the Senator from New Jersey. We are making progress. At the be- ginning of the week, we started way apart, and because of the American public, we have come closer and closer together. I commend my colleague from Oregon. He has adopted language which I believe closes the pawnshop loophole. That is a major step in the right direction. But, I say to my colleagues, there are other loopholes to close, and this very morning when there has been another shooting, why are we afraid to close those as well? There is the new 24-hour loophole when the instant check system does not work, when the records are not im-mediately available, the FBI says they need 72 hours to check to see if the per-son asking for the gun is a felon. We now make it 24 hours. If a gun show is held on Saturday, there is no way\u2014no way\u2014to check. So what we will have is felons getting guns at gun shows. We will have children even being able to buy guns in many different ways. The amendment of the Senator from New Jersey is simple. If we want to do it, let's do it. Let's not do an elaborate minuet where we take one step for-ward, two steps back, two steps for- ward, three steps back. That is what we have been doing this week. Yes, we are making progress, but on such a modest amendment like closing the gun show loophole, why does it take us 7 days of debate? Why does it take three dif-ferent fixes that still do not close all the loopholes? It is time for this body to come clean. It is time for this body to simply say, yes, we believe in the right to bear arms, but we also believe there are practical limitations that do not inter-fere with the rights of legitimate gun owners that we can make, and we can make them forthrightly and cleanly without all of these tiny baby steps. I guarantee you, the American people are fed up with compromises with the gun lobby. Since the beginning of time, some teenagers have been crazy and angry and mixed up and sometimes dis-turbed, but they have never been armed. Until now, a teenager who was truly disturbed had his fists, and there might be a broken thumb and there might be black-and-blue eyes. There would not be dead children being taken out of our schools in every corner of America. There are still loopholes, significant loopholes, that will be left in the law if we do not vote for the Lautenberg amendment. We can close them. We can stand up to the gun lobby. If any-thing, the actions this morning should have taught us that winking at the NRA and then smiling at the American people just produces more carnage. It is not hard, it is not technically difficult, and it is not bureaucratic. The law for licensed dealers has worked since 1968. The Brady law has worked since 1993. It has prevented 250,000 fel-ons from buying guns. What are we saying now? At a gun show, maybe; the FBI doesn't need 72 hours to check when it fails. What the heck is going on in this country? Why do we let the gun lobby continue to pry open more loopholes for the Klebolds and the Harrises to crawl through? Because those who want to get guns for illicit purposes have ways to do it. Even if Lautenberg should be adopted\u2014and I pray to God that it is\u2014they will have means. But let's at least do our best to close those loopholes. This week has been a week of both encouragement and discouragement for the American people. There has been encouragement. Because of the efforts of the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from Arizona, we are closing the pawnshop loophole, but it is dis-couraging overall, Mr. President. It is discouraging that it takes us such time to close a simple loophole like the gun show loophole and not do it cleanly and not do it completely. It is discouraging that when we close certain loopholes, somehow we feel obligated to open two or three more. It is discouraging that the gun lobby still seems to rule the roost, not in America, not in urban, suburban, or rural America, but here in this Congress. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5637 May 20, 1999 I am going to support the Smith amendment because it does close the pawnshop loophole, but I am going to vote for, and urgently and prayerfully urge my colleagues to support, the Lautenberg amendment because it does not open or leave open other loopholes. This is a test of the soul of America. I watched television this morning, and I said to myself: What is going on in America? The American people are asking themselves not only what is going on in America, they are asking, What is going on in the Senate of the United States? Let us show courage. Let us step up to the plate. Let us be strong, let us close the gun show loop-hole, let us not open new loopholes, and then let us move to do the other things that will prevent children and criminals from getting guns. Mr. President, I reserve the remain- der of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. R OB- ERTS ). The Senator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be an extra 6 minutes per side. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Idaho. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The dis- tinguished Senator from Idaho is rec-ognized for 5 minutes. Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this morning we stand on the floor of the Senate in the wake of another shooting at a high school in America. My col-league from New York has just said in rather plaintive but appropriate terms: What's wrong in America? We know there is something des- perately wrong. Yes, we struggle with this problem here. I do not question the sincerity of anyone who comes to the floor today to debate this issue. But it is very important for some of us to stand and make as clear as we pos-sibly can the differences between the amendments about which we are talk-ing. The reason there are an alleged 13 loopholes in the Craig-Hatch amend-ment is because there are 13 para-graphs, and the other side would sug-gest the whole thing is a loophole. That is simply not true\u2014it has never been true\u2014because, as the Senator from Oregon says, we are attempting to craft a very fine but important con-stitutional line between law-abiding citizens and their right to own guns un-fettered by a Federal Government and the criminal who will seek and find a gun anywhere he or she wants and, of course, the disaffected youth of Amer-ica who in some way find it necessary to express their frustrations or their sicknesses with the use of a firearm. What the other side has not said, but what they whisper loudly, is: The sec-ond amendment is a loophole. Let's wink and nod at it and then try to close it up. I cannot do that. I really do believe in our Constitution and I do believe that law-abiding citizens have rights. I must tell you, the other side is winking and nodding and saying: Oh, yes, they have rights, but we will close all of the doors up to that right and see if you can find the key to get through. So we came to the floor a week ago and began to strike a balance, recog-nizing that those constitutional rights must stand supreme for the law-abid-ing citizen, because the law-abiding citizen, in owning a gun under that right, accepts the responsibility of that gun. The Senator from New York is right; all he wants to do will not stop the criminal from getting a gun, because it never has. It is law enforcement that stops the criminal. It is the handcuff provision of this bill that says to Janet Reno: Put your cops on the street and arrest the criminal who uses the gun. Janet Reno, your record of law enforce-ment is dismal. You have winked and nodded at the law. And now it is time you wide-eyedly move to the streets and arrest the criminal who uses the gun. That is what the juvenile crime bill says. It says it loudly. It says it very clearly. Let's not wink and nod at our Constitution. Let's go at the criminal element of our society. Let's not create the kind of provision that the Lauten-berg amendment does. It is not 72 hours; it is the old 3-day waiting pe-riod. Even that side said, once we get instant check, that goes away. That is what the law said. Now they want it back, even though we tried to honor our legal citizens by providing an in-stant check system. That is what the Congress has said for a decade: We will fund it. We will implement it. And we will demand that it be used. The law-abiding citizens, the gun owners of America, in gun- owning America, say: We agree. There is no argument there. So as the chairman of the Senate Ju- diciary Committee worked with his committee and here on the floor to craft a juvenile crime bill, it is so trag-ic that the other side tried to make it a gun control bill only. Let's see what we did. We put juve- nile Brady in the bill. We said to vio-lent juveniles: You lose all of your con-stitutional rights when you act vio-lently as a juvenile felon. We have gone after gangs. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time allotted to the distinguished Senator from Idaho has expired. Mr. CRAIG. I ask my chairman for 1 more minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator is recognized for an additional minute. Mr. CRAIG. We have gone after gangs. We have gone after the juvenile offender. We have built in youth pro-tection. We are concerned about gun safety. This Senate has put in gun laws. The Senator from Vermont said: OK, if you don't believe C RAIG and H ATCH , let's say it one more time for the record: People who sell guns at gun shows will do background checks on those who purchase guns. I am sorry I sound as if I am stut- tering, but that is what the other side demanded, that we say it again. And we have said it again. We have not changed the law; we just said it again for the record. I hope that is enough. We are going after crime control. We are giving our schools of America the tools of safety. If they had those tools maybe in Georgia this morning it might have worked. So I hope we will withstand the vote on the Lautenberg amendment, vote it down, and let the Craig-Hatch amend-ment stand with its corrections\u2014\u2014 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired. Mr. CRAIG. And serve the law-abid- ing citizens of America as we search out the criminal element. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time? Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The dis- tinguished Senator from Rhode Island is recognized for 2 minutes. Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. Presi- dent. I rise in strong support of the Lau- tenberg amendment. It would close a number of serious loopholes that were created by the Hatch-Craig amend-ment. As the Hatch-Craig amendment stands today, any number of places where people could buy large quan-tities of guns would not be deemed gun shows, would not be subject to these types of regulations. The Lautenberg amendment closes that loophole. The Lautenberg amendment would allow for 72 hours in certain cir-cumstances for background checks. That is absolutely necessary. As the Senator from New York said, on a Sat-urday, when many of these gun shows take place, there is no possible way of doing a 24-hour background check. It would also allow the individual who is a weapons dealer to be subject to liability if they are not following the law. That is very critical. All of these provisions together are in the Lautenberg amendment. That is an amendment the American people support overwhelmingly, because they want a structure of laws that actually protects their children and does not simply provide some slick cover for the gun lobby. They want their children protected. They want us to do it in a sensible way. They want us to pass laws which are not cynical exercises in self-preservation but will actually pro-tect the children of America. The Lautenberg amendment will do this. I strongly support it. Gun control is absolutely essential to the process of protecting children, but so many of these incidents we have seen\u2014as just this morning\u2014show that we also need to take preventative action to ensure that children, with or without access to firearms, do not feel self-destructive VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov \u2014 SENATE S5638 May 20, 1999 and destructive of others. That is part of this overall legislation. In fact, we could do much more. Today we are here to make a clear choice between laws that work to protect children and an exercise in simply protecting the gun lobby. I support the Lautenberg amendment. I thank the Senator. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time? Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Nebraska. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Nebraska is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. KERREY. I thank the chairman, Mr. President. The largest gun dealer in the State of Nebraska is Guns Unlimited. The owner of that operation is a man by the name of Tom Nichols. I turned to Tom when this legislation was first in-troduced and when the issue of gun control came up because I trust him. I believe that he understands what works and what does not work. As I said on this amendment when I first came to the floor, I have sup-ported things that work. If I believe it is going to make the public safer, I will support it. If I don't think it will work, and that all we are doing is sort of a political figleaf, which happens from time to time on these issues, then I am not going to support it, because all we are going to do is add regulatory fric-tion or interference with people who are law-abiding citizens, and it is just an irritant; it does not do anything other than perhaps make our press re-leases sound a little bit better. But I asked Tom about this amend- ment. I have great respect for the Sen-ator from Oregon and the Senator from Vermont. I think they have come a long way in closing the loophole on pawnshops, which is very important, because oftentimes people who are criminals or who have guns that they have stolen will go to a pawnshop and pawn the gun. They need to have a background check done. There is still a significant weakness in this amendment. Again, I urge col-leagues to vote for the Smith-Jeffords amendment\u2014or is it Jeffords-Smith, whatever it is. I urge them to vote for that and to vote for the Lautenberg- Kerrey amendment. Here is the reason why. In the words of Tom Nichols, the owner of the larg-est gun shop in the State of Nebraska\u2014 he sells more handguns and other kinds of guns than anybody in the State of Nebraska\u201480 percent of the people who come in to buy a gun in his shop are cleared in 24 hours. The instant check system gets them just like that. These are the law-abiding citizens. These peo-ple have absolutely nothing in their background at all that would indicate there is any kind of a problem. But, he said, the people of greatest concern aren't those 80 percent. The people of greatest concern are the ones who take a longer period of time, require a spe-cial agent to get into their background to find out what is going on. If it is only 24 hours, what is going to happen is, yes, the law-abiding citizens will be OK; you will clear those out with no trouble at all. But those aren't the people who are the problem. Those people are getting cleared out in the 24- hour instant check, just like that. It is the people who require a little bit more work who are the ones we want to deny the opportunity to own a gun. I urge colleagues, as they come down here, if you really want to try to change the law to increase public safe-ty, my recommendation is to vote for the amendment offered by the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from Vermont, but then also vote for the amendment which has been offered by the Senator from New Jersey and my-self. Ask your own gun dealers why and who and what happens with that addi-tional 48 hours. They will tell you. The answer is, that is when you get the peo-ple who are the biggest problem. That is when you create the most public safety with the Brady bill background checks. I understand that this issue has been highly charged and there has been a lot of heat and rhetoric and hard feelings on both sides which has occurred as a consequence of that. But if you are try-ing to write a law that will increase public safety, that will decrease the number of Americans who are either felons or dangerous or have something else in their background but own guns, I urge Senators to vote for both of these amendments, which we will have an opportunity to do, I guess, in about 10 minutes. Again, I thank the Senator from New Jersey and others who have taken the leadership on this. I thank, again, Tom Nichols from Guns Unlimited in Ne-braska. You put yourself out a little bit in this kind of situation. He is basi-cally saying we need to have a level regulatory playing field. You have 2,000 or 3,000 gun shows a year. The Senators from Oregon and Vermont will allow instant checks for those gun shows, but we need that other 48 hours in order to be able to level the playing field be-tween licensed gun dealers and gun shows. That is all we are doing. There is no more money that they will be paying in, no more regulatory burden. It merely levels the playing field so people who buy a gun in a gun show and people who buy a gun from a licensed dealer will have to go through the same thing. If you want to make Americans safe, I urge you to vote for both of these amendments. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Utah. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, may I in- quire, how much time remains on both sides? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Utah has 16 minutes, and the Senator from New Jersey has 9 min-utes. Mr. HATCH. Is there anybody on their side who cares to speak at this time, or should I? Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would like to give the proponents time. Mr. HATCH. I am happy to do that. We are hearing a lot in the media and on the floor of the Senate demonizing those who believe in the second amend-ment, those who strive to protect the rights of American citizens. The sin-cere steps taken today to try to find a middle ground are slapped aside by some. And, quite frankly, I find that to be discouraging and dispiriting. I still hold out hope that the Little- ton shooting can bring out the best in all of us. We have come together on some issues and have before us a bill that responds to Littleton and does so in a way which respects the rights of law-abiding citizens. But to suggest, as one of our colleagues did yesterday, that in defending the second amend-ment rights of law-abiding citizens the Senate is ''whistling past the grave-yard of Littleton'' is contemptible, in my view. Given what is in this bill al-ready, how can anyone in good con-science really say such a thing. If today's shooting in Atlanta isn't a wake-up call to those who want to play politics with this bill, I don't know what is. Americans still believe that gun own- ership is a basic right of our people. If any community would change its views as a result of the Littleton shooting, it would be the residents of Colorado, where prior to the shooting 70 percent believed firearms ownership was a basic right. Has support for gun control increased in Colorado? No, just the op-posite. A recent poll found that 75 per-cent of Coloradans believe gun owner-ship is a basic right. The people of Col-orado and elsewhere recognize that this is a complex problem and that going on a gun control feeding frenzy is not the answer. Those who think otherwise should take a deep breath, take stock in what we have accomplished to date with this bill, and bring this bill to passage, because this bill can have a dramatic effect on helping us to resolve some of these problems with teen vio-lence in our society today. We have had a vigorous and lengthy debate about gun shows and how best to limit criminal access to guns at these shows. There have been numer-ous unnecessary delays on this matter. Today I hope we can bring closure on this matter. This is an evolving proc-ess. After several days of debate last week, Republicans took a step to re-quire background checks at gun shows without substantial cost and without overregulatory burdens. We all realize our duty to do what is best for our children and to uphold the Constitution of the United States, in-cluding the second amendment. We all realize that the political benefits of scoring debating points lasts only for the hour, while the real benefits of pro-tecting our children last for a lifetime. The evolutionary process continues. The supporters of the Lautenberg amendment have made changes to their proposal to bring it closer to our VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5639 May 20, 1999 plan, and we are proposing the Smith- Jeffords amendment to deal with the pawnshop exemption and to clarify the special licensee provision. Our plan, however, does not impose substantial disincentives to obey the law. My sense and hope is that our efforts will con-tinue to evolve and that we will be able to find common ground, a common ground that protects the rights of law- abiding citizens to legally use guns but punishes criminals who illegally use guns. There is one firearm-related provi- sion on which I hope we can reach bi-partisan agreement. That is the treat-ment of pawnshops that have tradition-ally been exempt from the requirement to conduct background checks when they simply return a firearm to its owner. Contrary to what the distinguished Senator from Nebraska said, if a stolen gun is pawned, it will be discovered when the gun comes into the pawn shop. State law requires pawn shops to notify state or local law enforcement agencies concerning the gun. These state and local agencies then check to determine if the gun is stolen. If the gun is stolen, the police can inves-tigate and, if necessary, arrest the pawning customer. This all happens be-fore the gun is returned to the cus-tomer and thus, before a Federal back-ground check would be required. The pawn shops protested the 1993 Brady law that required them to do a federal background check in addition to the state check they were already doing. Further, they complained about the 3-day waiting period. If a pawn shop had to wait 3 days under the orginal Brady law to conduct a federal background check, it could not return the gun to the customer when the cus-tomer repaid the loan. That is why Congress amended the Brady law in 1994 to exempt pawn shops from the re-quirement to do a federal background check. The Craig amendment which we passed last Wednesday simply restored the exemption for pawnshops that had been part of the Brady law for 4 years and had been approved by some notable people, even some here on this floor. Thus, the Craig amendment did not ef-fect a major change in law, but a change back to how the Brady law read from 1994 to November 1998 when the exemption lapsed as the instant check system became effective. As I have stated repeatedly, it is my goal to find common ground on these issues. Wherever possible, I want to do what is best for our children and for the public, which is consistent with our oath as Senators to uphold the Con-stitution. Frankly, I viewed the pawn shop provision as a technical matter, one which should not be politicized. I am glad that Senators S MITH and J EF- FORDS have made a bipartisan proposal to resolve this matter so that both sides can get together. With respect to special licensees, last Wednesday the Senate passed the Craig amendment which provided that per- sons who wished to engage in the busi-ness of selling firearms but just at guns shows must obtain a special Federal li-cense to do so. Subsequently, however, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle complained that the Craig amend-ment was not clear enough in requiring special licensees to conduct back-ground checks. We have looked at the language and think it is clear. Nonetheless, to address the concerns of our colleagues, I offered a simple one-page amendment last Friday which made it absolutely clear, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that special licens-ees were subject to the background check provisions of the Gun Control Act. Unfortunately, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle rejected this clarification. Instead of dealing with their concern, they wanted to debate it, and, boy, have they debated it. Today the Smith-Jeffords amend- ment contains the clarification I of-fered last Friday with a bit more expla-nation. It states: Except as to the State and local planning and zoning requirements for a licensed prem-ises as provided in subparagraph (D), a spe-cial licensee shall be subject to all of the provisions of this chapter applicable to deal-ers, including, but not limited to, the per-formance of an instant background check. The key language of the amendment states: A special licensee shall [not might, but shall] be subject to all [not some, but all] of the provisions of this chapter applicable to dealers, including but not limited to, the performance of an instant background check. This could not be any clearer. Special licensees must perform a background check before selling a firearm at a gun show. So let's get rid of the talk about loopholes. The Smith-Jeffords amendment deals in a bipartisan fashion with the pawn shop exemption and with the clarifica-tion of the requirement for special li-censees to perform background checks. There has been a lot of talk about loopholes, and the Smith-Jeffords amendment should lay most of that talk to rest. But the biggest loophole for criminals is the lack of enforce-ment of criminal laws that currently exist by our Attorney General and this administration. If we in Congress pass a law prohibiting a criminal trans-action, it is the duty of the Attorney General to enforce it. But she has not. Our bill includes the CUFF program to fund more prosecutions of gun crimes and orders the Attorney General to re-port on her progress in prosecuting gun crimes. By enforcing criminal statutes, we can protect our children and our schools. If a criminal knows that the statutes we pass will not be enforced, however, we expose our children to more crime. Let me make a point with these charts. Is this a record to be proud of in this administration? We are quoting the Executive Office of the U.S. Attor-neys for these figures. Prosecutions under the Brady Act background checks: In 1996, zero. They claim that the Brady Act stopped 200-some-odd- thousand felons from getting guns. There was not one prosecution in 1996, not one prosecution in 1997, and just one prosecution in 1998. If there is a loophole, it is in the fail- ure of the Attorney General and the Justice Department to enforce the laws that are already on the books. Yet, you hear this hue and cry for more gun con-trol laws. But this is only for political purposes because they know that their own Attorney General will not enforce these laws. Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Will the Sen- ator yield for a question? Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield for a question. Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I wonder if the Senator can address this. He is into this issue, but I think we have to an-swer the question the Senator from Ne-braska has raised, Why do you need the 3 days, 72 hours? My point really is this. I wonder if this amendment isn't so regulatory that it really isn't trying to end gun shows, and not an attempt to provide the service that we are asking be pro-vided. If they find that there is a ques-tion, shouldn't the Justice Depart-ment, the FBI, deny the check in 24 hours, 1 hour, or whenever it occurs, and then go investigate it? Mr. HATCH. The Senator really poses an interesting question. The current law requires no background check for sales at gun shows between non-li-censed individuals. For sales by deal-ers, however, an Instant Check back-ground check is required. If there is a question, the FBI gets 3 days to resolve the question. Of course, because a gun show generally lasts only 3 days, the show will be over by the time the FBI is through checking. Our bill requires the FBI to resolve any question within 24 hours. This strikes a balance between the time constraints of a gun show and the time needed by the FBI to resolve any In-stant Check question. Further, this is an evolving process. As technology advances and more records are placed on the Instant Check database, the FBI will be able to resolve any question in less than 24 hours. Mr. SMITH of Oregon. If the Senator will yield for another question. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, don't you believe that if the Justice Department needed more resources to do this to provide the service, we would find the ways and means to accommo-date them? Mr. HATCH. The Senator makes a good point. As chairman of the Judici-ary Committee, I will work with the FBI and the ATF to ensure they have the resources to get the job done. We will do everything in our power to find the means to solve these problems. Mr. President, with respect to the Attorney General's prosecution record, this is not a record to be proud of\u2014this business of prosecutions under Brady. There were zero in 1996, zero in 1997, VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5640 May 20, 1999 and one in 1998. Yet, they want new laws. We are not enforcing the laws we already have. Is this a record to be proud of? Pros- ecutions for transfer of handguns or ammunition to a juvenile: This Justice Department, in 1996, had nine prosecu-tions. We have had that many shoot-ings in the last short while. In 1997, five prosecutions. In 1998, six prosecu-tions. Why aren't we enforcing the laws that already exist instead of making political points to have a whole bunch of other laws that there is a question whether the Justice Department will enforce? Let me go into this one. Is this a record to be proud of by this adminis-tration? Prosecutions for possession or discharge of a firearm in a school zone. Think about that. In 1996, four prosecu-tions; in 1997, five; in 1998, eight. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could enforce the laws that are already on the books? We would not have nearly the problems we have today. By the way, this business of prosecutions for transfer of a handgun or ammunition to a juvenile, and others, there are thousands of cases that they know of and there are only these limited num-ber of prosecutions. Well, Mr. President, the plain fact of the matter is that the revised Lauten-berg amendment, though improved to look more like the Republican pro-posal, is still not as good as the current bill as amended. The revised Lautenberg amendment still fails to provide qualified immu-nity to persons who obey the law and act appropriately with firearms, even after the Senate voted on it yesterday to provide qualified immunity when parents properly use child safety locks. The revised Lautenberg amendment still fails to provide tax relief to licens-ees and others who perform back-ground checks. And the revised Lau-tenberg amendment still fails to re-lieve gun show organizers of substan-tial new recordkeeping requirements. It is very unfair. Thus, the revised Lautenberg amend- ment is a small step in the right direc-tion, and I sincerely appreciate that step. However, in my view, it fails to go far enough. The revised Lautenberg amendment will change an unregulated market into a very heavily regulated market overnight. In fact, by imposing this much regulation, without providing any immunity or tax protection, and without any provision for licensing temporary dealers, the revised Lauten-berg amendment will create a black market in gun trading, because people will not go to the gun shows, they will go into the streets and do it. By cre-ating a black market in gun trading, the revised Lautenberg amendment will inevitably promote gun sales where there are no Federal licenses, no records, and no background checks. We do not need a black market, but we need a free market with reasonable, nonburdensome regulations where buy-ers and sellers have incentives to com- ply with the law. Mr. President, the current bill with the Smith-Jeffords amendment will strike the appropriate balance between the legitimate interests of law-abiding citizens to own, buy, and sell lawful products and the public interest in pre-venting criminals from obtaining guns. The powerful incentives included in our plan will ensure that persons will com-ply with the mandatory background check requirement on all sales at every gun show. The Republican plan also gives law-abiding gun owners the peace of mind that they have not inadvert-ently transferred a firearm to a felon, and strongly encourages the Attorney General to begin prosecuting the crimi-nals who have violated the existing gun laws. Mr. President, this juvenile justice bill is too important to our country's schools, parents, and children to be held up by endless debates. Only this morning, we heard of an- other shooting in Georgia. So far, thank goodness, there have been no re-ports of death. We have to stop debating and pass this bill. We have had enough delays. We need to protect our students and our schools now. We in the Senate have an opportunity to take a major step to-ward protecting our children by pass-ing the juvenile crime bill. Our country needs it. We should do it in a bipar-tisan way, and we need to do it today. I reserve the remainder of our time. Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from New Jersey is recognized. Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Massachusetts is recognized for 3 minutes. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senate has spent the past week at-tempting to clean up the mess that our Republican colleagues have made over the gun show loophole. Now, again we have a chance to do the job correctly, by closing the gun show loophole the right way, not the NRA way. As they say in the circus, it's a big job cleaning up after a big elephant, es-pecially when the National Rifle Asso-ciation is the trainer of the elephant. The first two attempts by our Repub- lican colleagues to close the gun show loophole were a travesty. They left the loophole open, and they created new loopholes while they were doing it. While the Senate dithers, the need grows greater. Gun violence has struck again at one of the nation's schools\u2014 this time at a school in a suburb of At-lanta. Enough is enough. We will decide today whether the United States Sen-ate is serious about closing the gun show loophole, or whether we will con-tinue to allow young people to have al-most unlimited access to guns. The Lautenberg amendment will close this deadly loophole in our gun laws, and close it all the way, not just part of the way. The Smith amendment only goes part way. It closes the loophole our Re-publican friends opened for pawn shops last week\u2014but it leaves unchanged the other serious loopholes that put guns in the wrong hands at gun shows. Our Republican colleagues still refuse to close another major loophole they created last week\u2014the 24 hour loophole, which makes a farce out of the background checks on gun pur-chasers. These background checks have kept thousands of guns out of the hands of criminals and others who have no busi-ness owning guns. But the NRA opposes that law, so it wants to undermine it in a way that will protect illegal trans-actions at gun shows. The Lautenberg amendment closes this loophole too. Our Republican colleagues still refuse to close a third loophole they created last week, which makes it much more difficult for police to trace guns used by criminals. They have set up a new class of gun dealers called ''special registrants,'' who can sell as many guns as they want to anyone they want, without keeping the records needed to trace guns used in crimes. The Lautenberg amendment closes this loophole, too. Since the tragedy in Littleton, par- ents and children across the country have lived in fear that their school\u2014 their community\u2014could be next. Now, it has happened in Georgia. On some days in recent weeks, parents have kept their children away from school in an effort to shelter them from vio-lence. Families cannot continue to live this way\u2014in constant fear that their chil-dren and their school could be the next gun battleground. There is only one way to close the gun show loophole, and that's to adopt the Lautenberg amendment. In a few minutes, we will have two important votes. The Senate can act on the urgent needs of the American peo-ple, or it can continue to play ostrich\u2014 head in the sand, ignoring the national crisis of gun violence. It is clear that the overwhelming ma- jority of the American people want Congress to pass responsible gun con-trol measures. Eighty-nine percent of the people say that it is important for this country to pass stricter gun con-trol laws. Now, we have the opportunity to get it right. Gun laws work. The facts speak for themselves. It is time\u2014long past time\u2014for the Senate to act, to say enough is enough is enough is enough. I thank the Senator from New Jersey and hope his amendment will be ac-cepted. Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Sen- ator from Massachusetts. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The dis- tinguished Senator from New Jersey is recognized. Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I, first of all, want to say to my col-leagues on the other side\u2014to Senator VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov \u2014 SENATE S5641 May 20, 1999 SMITH, to Senator J EFFORDS , to Sen- ator G REGG , to Senator H ATCH \u2014I really do appreciate the fact that they are trying to arrive at a consensus. I think what was said in the earlier presen-tation was that it is a bipartisan agree-ment. I wonder whether parents in Littleton, CO, care whether it is bipar-tisan or not, or whether it is a com-promise or not. What they want to make sure of is that it never happens again, as it did this morning in Geor-gia. It is a pity we are discussing whether or not there is too much regulation, or whether or not the law enforcement people are hard at work. I want them to look at the statistics. We will talk about that in just a minute. That is not the issue. The issue is, do you want to save lives, or do you want to save the NRA? Do you want to permit them to continue to oppose all sensible legis-lation? There are people sitting here, I am sure, who have children at home and they don't want to worry about them when they go to school. That is the issue. What are we talking about here? Eighty-nine percent of the American people say they want the gun loopholes closed\u2014finally shut. What do you think the percentage might be out of Georgia today, or out of Colorado, or out of Pearl, MS; or Paducah, KY; or Springfield? What do you think the percentage of those families are? I will bet you it is 100 percent. We know one thing. It was admitted by the distinguished Senator from Idaho, or at least suggested\u2014not ad-mitted. He said 40 percent of the people who buy guns at gun shows do so with-out any identification at all. ''Buyers anonymous.'' Buy your gun. Don't tell anybody who you are. Forty percent, by my calculation. It is around 800,000 guns a year. Maybe I am wrong by 100,000 or 150,000. Over 5 million hand-guns are sold in this country each and every year. Mr. President, I want us to stand up to the American people and say we care more about your kids; we care more about your family; we care more about violence in this country than we do about whether or not this one gets credit, or whether it looks like we are imposing an extra burden. I want to talk about the burdens for just a moment and talk about Federal gun prosecutions. The distinguished Members on that side will say they are down. I would tell you this: Twenty- five percent more criminals are sent to prison for State and Federal weapons offenses than in 1992. That is because we work more closely with our part-ners in State and local law enforce-ment. Look at the result. Stop looking at the process. Look at where we want to come out. Overall violence and prop-erty crimes are down by 20 percent. The murder rate is down 28 percent\u2014 the lowest level in 30 years. We have accomplished something. Do you know why? Because we are asking questions about guns. Yes. There are things wrong in our culture. There certainly are. But I look at our culture, and I look at other nations which are well developed. We have 35,000 Americans killed each year with firearms com-pared to 15 in Japan\u201415 people\u201430 in Great Britain. Just take the murder side of that\u2014homicides, almost 14,000; suicides, 18,000. That happens, I guess, in other countries. But I am sure it doesn't happen to the same extent with guns. When we hear our friends decrying this extension of time that is needed to get your mitts on a gun, why should we slow down the process? Somebody wants a gun. They give it to them. That is what they are saying. I will tell you something. If they read the law carefully\u2014the Lautenberg law\u2014then they would see that the law limiting enforcement to 24 hours for gun show background checks is only if\u201472 hours; forgive me\u2014only if there is some detection in the first minutes that something is wrong. If there is nothing wrong, you can have a gun in 5 minutes. Is that quick enough? Is a day quick enough? I think it is quick enough for the American people. Ask those in Littleton and ask them in other places how quickly the guns ought to be available. No, Mr. President, we are missing the boat. We are arguing about process while we are exposing more and more of our kids to accessibility to guns. It is not right. The Lautenberg amend-ment closes the loopholes once and for all. Again, I commend Senators S MITH and J EFFORDS for closing the pawnshop loophole, but they don't close all of the loopholes. There is still limited liabil-ity for gun sellers. There are still peo-ple who are going to be able to buy guns without registering them. They are not registering without going through a background check. They are not insisting that everybody go through a background check, and they are not insisting that 24 hours be ex-tended to 72 for normal purchases. I think what we ought to do is say once and for all\u2014I hope my colleagues will respond\u2014to the American people, enough of the debate about the process. The process is fair. We are not talking about increasing taxes. We are not talking about increasing the bureaucracy. I would like to mention one thing\u2014 that even as our friends talk about more enforcement being the difference, the fact is that when we tried to hire 280 new ATF agents, requesting over $10 million to hire those people, and over 40 new Federal prosecutors as well, the NRA has never supported backing its tough talk with real money for State, local and Federal law en-forcement agencies to investigate, ar-rest and prosecute. They like to talk about it here. But they don't want to pay for it. It is time to face up to reality. One is we are going to probably pass the Smith-Jeffords amendment with an overwhelming vote. That is OK, be-cause it starts the process. But it doesn't complete the process. The proc-ess will be complete when the Lauten-berg amendment is passed, and I hope we have enough courage in this room to stand up and say, ''Yes, I vote for the Lautenberg amendment.'' The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the distinguished Senator from New Jersey has expired. Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the President. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time remains? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The dis- tinguished Senator from Utah has 42 seconds. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will be very brief. The fact of the matter is that the overwhleming majority of instant checks can be completed in a matter of minutes. If the instant check system approves the purchase, it will do so quickly. If the instant check system disappoves the purchase, it will do so quickly. The problem is the portion that instead of being approved or dis-approved, raise a question. Under the 24-hour rule, the Justice Department has to work harder to resolve questions for gun show instant checks. This is be-cause the gun show will be over in 3 days. If you allow 3 days to resolve questions for gun show checks, the questions will not be resolved until after the gun show is over. It means private people are going to take their guns to the streets and sell them there. It means a black market. It means more problems\u2014more accessibility to those who are unsavory in our society to guns. I can't imagine why people can't see this, because it is as clear as the nose on anybody's face. The politics of it is more important than seeing the truth. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Wisconsin make a unanimous consent request not related to this matter. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The distinguished Senator from Wis- consin is recognized. CHANGE OF VOTE Mr. KOHL. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, on the rollcall vote on the McConnell amendment No. 365 to S. 254, I voted no. I ask unanimous con-sent that I be recorded as voting in favor of the McConnell amendment. Changing my vote will not affect the final outcome of that vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I hope Senators in voting for Smith-Jeffords will realize it is only a baby step to-wards background checks. If they really want to close all 13 loopholes, they also have to vote for the Lautenberg amendment. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5642 May 20, 1999 The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes equally divided. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from New Jersey. Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, very simply, we have just made a decision to close a couple of the loopholes that existed before on gun show sales, and I commend the Senators who offered the amendment. But we are still left with significant numbers of people who do not have to have a background check, and that is not the way we want to do it. We want to close all the loopholes. They have insisted we remove the 72- hour window for investigation of back-grounds, and that is only triggered if there is something that discredits the individual. Otherwise, it is 24 hours or less. If there is nothing on the person's record, the sale goes through. It is hard to imagine why we cannot take enough time to investigate the prospective buyer sufficiently to make sure we are protecting our people. That is the issue, and I hope our friends on the Republican side who voted with us last time will continue to vote with us. We could have won this several times if we had support from the Republican side of the aisle. I hope they will demonstrate to the American people that there is concern about limiting access to guns as the citizens of the country want us to do. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator's time has expired. The Senator from Utah. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we have debated this at length. The Lautenberg amendment creates more loopholes. It will be more expensive. It is going to increase taxes. And it will be more bu-reaucratic. I think it is going to push people into the streets to sell guns on the black market, which I think undermines ev-erything he is trying to do. I yield back the remainder of my time. The VICE PRESIDENT. The question in on agreeing to amendment No. 362. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote. Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table. The VICE PRESIDENT. Without ob- jection, it is so ordered. (Mr. ALLARD assumed the chair.) f UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unan- imous consent that the Senate proceed to the supplemental appropriations conference report and there be 3 hours for debate, to be equally divided in the usual form, and that it be in order for Senator G RAMM to raise a point of order against the conference report, and at that point there be 30 minutes equally divided in the usual form on the motion to waive. I further ask that following the con- clusion or yielding back of time and the disposition of the motion to waive the Budget Act, if successful, the Sen-ate proceed to vote on adoption of the conference report. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I wish to amend the consent agreement to allow me to offer a bill immediately following the adop-tion of the conference report regarding an across-the-board cut in nondefense discretionary spending to offset the supplemental appropriations con-ference report. I understand that the conference committee has been dis-banded since the House of Representa-tives has voted to adopt the conference report. Therefore, I understand that it will require unanimous consent for the conference report to be amended. Having said that, I now ask unani- mous consent that following the adop-tion of the conference report, I be rec-ognized to offer a bill that would call for an across-the-board cut in non-defense discretionary funding to offset VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5643 May 20, 1999 the supplemental appropriations con- ference report, and there be 30 minutes for debate on the bill, to be equally di-vided, and no amendments or motions in order. I further ask consent that imme- diately following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill, without any intervening action or debate. Several Senators addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma- jority leader has the floor. Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe we are proceeding under a reservation of the right to object. Senator E NZIwas explaining his reservation, and he is asking to be recognized to offer a bill that would call for an across-the-board cut in the appropriations process in order to pay for the additional funding here. Is that the gist of the Senator's reservation of the right to object? Mr. ENZI. Yes. There are a few ques- tions we want to ask in regard to re-serving this. Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, further reserving the right to object, I want to note my support for what Sen-ator E NZIis stating, and that I am con- cerned that what we have in the under-lying bill is not paid for and we ought to have appropriate offsets to this sup-plemental. It is an important supple-mental bill, but I am reserving the right to object and I am saying that we should pay for this. It should be offset with other cuts in nondefense discre-tionary and domestic spending. We have a $15 billion supplemental appropriations bill. We are asking in the nondefense areas that there be off-sets to that. This is not a major thing for us to do. I think it is fully appro-priate that we move forward and have offsets taking place in this supple-mental bill. There is important spend-ing taking place in the supplemental that I think is appropriate. There is some for my home State and the dis-aster we had. But let's pay for it. That is why I am reserving the right to ob-ject. Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, also reserving the right to object, I share Senator E NZI's concern and mak- ing this UC request to introduce a bill that would allow us to have offsets. We have an appropriations bill, as so often is the case with these emergency spending bills that come before us, traveling like a freight train. The ''freight train'' has little stowaways hidden all through it. So in the very short period of time that I began to look at some of the little stowaways hidden on this ''freight train,'' I found $1.8 million for safety renovations of the O'Neill House Office Building, $1.9 million for the Northeast Multi-Spe-cies Fishery, $250,000 for the L.A. Civic Center, $1.5 million for the University of DC, and $3.76 million for the House page dormitory. These may all be good things, but they are certainly not going through the right process. There is $100 million for aid to Jor- dan; $77 million to the Census Bureau, Postal Service, USTR, et cetera. The Office of the Special Trustee for Amer-ican Indians gets $22 million. I don't see how that can be termed an emer-gency coming before us. There is $8 million dollars for an access road to Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Da-kota. On and on go these little stow-aways. There is a high school, White River High School, which receives $239,000. The point is, Mr. President, we have a process that is being perverted, a process that is being circumvented. Mr. DORGAN. Regular order, Mr. President. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The reg- ular order has been called for. Is there objection to the request of the majority leader? Mr. GRAMS. Reserving the right to object, I also rise in strong support of Mr. E NZI\u2014\u2014 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator has no right to reserve the right to object when the regular order has been called for. Is there objection? Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec- tion is heard. The majority leader is recognized. Mr. LOTT. In light of the objection, I renew my request for time agreements on the supplemental conference report, as stated earlier in my remarks, with 15 minutes of the Democrats' time under Senator D ORGAN and 10 minutes of the Republican time under Senator M CCAIN. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, what we have now\u2014if I could explain it to the Senate\u2014we have set aside the juvenile justice bill for now. We are going to do the supplemental appropriations bill. We have a 3-hour time agreement with some specific time set up for individual Senators. We also have a waiver of a point of order, with 30 minutes of time equally divided on that. So there will be a vote on that point of order and, I presume, the vote on final passage. At that point, it is our intention to go back to the juvenile justice bill. I say to the Senators who reserved their right to object, I certainly under-stand why they are doing it. I appre-ciate it and I want to support their ef-fort. There is no question that more of this bill should have been offset. I know the chairman of the Appropria-tions Committee, who is probably in the vicinity, does not agree with that. But I have indicated all along I thought there should be more offsets. To Senators E NZI and B ROWNBACK , HUTCHINSON , GRAMS , and perhaps S ES- SIONS \u2014and I am not quite sure if Sen- ator M CCAINis here to raise that con- cern also\u2014I certainly am sympathetic, but there was objection heard from Senator D ORGAN . Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield? Mr. LOTT. I will yield to the Sen- ator. Mr. DORGAN. I want to observe that the unanimous consent proposal of-fered by the Senator from Wyoming had not been cleared on our side. We were constrained to object. I also ob-serve, if we are going to establish an order for legislation to be brought to the floor following disposition of the supplemental, for example, we may want to bring to the floor the proposed amendment that died in conference committee by a 14-14 vote dealing with the agricultural fund. Our point was that there are other priorities as well. But the unanimous consent request had not been served on our side. That is why we were con-strained to object. Mr. LOTT. I wonder if other Senators want me to yield. I yield the floor. f 1999 EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT\u2014CON-FERENCE REPORT Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of conference on the bill (H.R. 1141) making emer-gency supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1999, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the conference report. The legislative clerk read as follows: The committee on conference on the dis- agreeing votes of the two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 1141), have agreed to recommend and do rec-ommend to their respective Houses this re-port, signed by a majority of the conferees. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to the consideration of the conference re-port. (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the R ECORD of May 14, 1999.) The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. F ITZ- GERALD ). The Senator from Alaska. Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, is the conference report accompanying H.R. 1141 before the Senate? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator is correct. Mr. STEVENS. That conference re- port is not amendable? There are no amendments in disagreement? The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I first want to start off by commending the chairman of the House committee, Congressman B ILLYOUNG , for his lead- ership in the conference on this bill. He was the chairman of this conference, and through his efforts we have achieved passage not only by the House but we achieved the result of getting a bill out of committee. Chairman Y OUNG and I have worked very closely in the past. He chaired the defense sub-committee before becoming chairman of the full committee. I look forward to continuing that partnership during his tenure as chairman of the House com-mittee. We face a difficult task in reconciling the funds needed to respond to hurri-cane damage in Central America, the VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, SENATE S5644 May 20, 1999 Federal Emergency Management Agen- cy and agriculture disasters\u2014those FEMA disasters are national disasters declared by the President\u2014and contin-ued military operations in Kosovo, in Bosnia, in Iraq, and in the high state of alert in South Korea. This is not an easy period to be chairman of this committee. We have what amounts to four major crises going on at one time. We are trying to maintain our defense capabilities to preserve our interests worldwide. This is very difficult, apparently, for some Members to understand. It is a difficult process, at best, to handle a supple-mental and an emergency bill together, but it does take consideration of the Members of the Senate to understand which versions in these bills are emer-gency and which are just a normal sup-plemental. They have been joined together. The President has sent us two bills and the House has passed two bills. They ad-dress the needs and the formal requests of the President. The Senate passed one bill, the Central American agri-culture bill, in late March, prior to the Easter recess. At that time, before the recess, I urged that we have a chance to come to the floor and pass that sup-plemental. We knew there was going to be a second supplemental, but we could not get the time on the floor and the Senate did not act on the separate Kosovo package. Due to the emergency nature of the funding for military operations and the availability of the first bill, it was our intention to merge the two bills into a second single bill in conference, which we have done. That is consistent with rules of the Senate and the House. These were matters which were emer-gency in nature, and we have added them as emergencies. Now, as I think Senators are aware, there are many ideas in how we can ad-dress other needs in this bill. Supple-mental bills have routinely been amended by both the House and the Senate. Questions have been raised about some of the matters in these bills\u2014assuming that we have no right to add any amendments to emergency bills. Now, this is both a supplemental and an emergency appropriations bill be-fore the Senate. I hope Senators will keep that in mind. As most of the Sen-ators are aware, these matters are brought up by individual Members of the Senate or the House and are con-sidered and adopted by majority vote. I am not that happy about some of the provisions of this bill but, again, I have the duty to carry to the Senate floor those amendments that were included by action of the conferees. I hope Sen-ators will keep that in mind as we pro-ceed. The conferees decided that some of these matters that are before the Sen-ate and were presented to us should be reserved in the fiscal year 2000 bill, which the Appropriations Committees will start marking up next week. We cannot get to the regular appropria- tions bills until we conclude the action of the Congress on the supplemental and emergency matters in the bill be-fore the Senate now. Again, I know there are objections to this bill; there are objections to the process we are following. Many of those objections are brought forward because we do not have a point of order against legislation on appropriations bills. That is not my doing. I have sought to restore that point of order and I con-tinue to support the concept of that point of order. But we have several matters included in the Senate-passed version of the bill that were deleted by the conference. One of them was a matter that was very close to my heart, and that is the Glacier Bay provision which was of-fered by my colleague, Senator M UR- KOWSKI . What I am saying is there are mat- ters before the Senate some people ob-ject to. There are matters not in the bill that people object to, and one of them is that Alaska provision of my colleague. Obviously, a conference re-port is always a compromise. That is why we go to conference. We have dis-agreements with what the House has done, the House has disagreements with what we have done, and we meet in conference and try to resolve the problems. This bill, for instance, contains more money for defense needs than were pro-posed by the Senate. After we went to conference with the House, we con-cluded they were right in seeking addi-tional moneys for our defense readi-ness. There is no question it also con-tains more funding for refugees and for agricultural relief than was proposed by the House. The House has come to-wards the position of the Senate on both refugees and agriculture relief. Again, I think that is the process of compromise that should take place in a conference. This conference report needs to be passed today. The men and women of the Armed Forces must un-derstand we support them, regardless of our points of view on the war that is going on in Kosovo. Refugees ousted from their homes and their country by Serbian atrocities need our help also. I was honored to be able to go with other Members of the Senate to visit Albania. We saw the camps in Macedonia. We visited with the President of Macedonia and the Prime Minister of Albania. We went to see our forces in Aviano\u2014that is our air base in Italy\u2014and we visited with the NATO people in Bosnia. Many Senators here have also visited the region since that trip I took with my colleagues and Members of the House. There were 21 of us on the first trip. All the Senators who went there know what needs to be done; there is no question in our minds. It is unfortu-nate we cannot take more people over there to let them see it, because I think uniformly the people who saw the troubles over there are supportive of this bill. We have provided addi- tional funds in this bill for the Kosovo operation and for the victims of the war there in Kosovo. They are sort of an insurance policy. We have faced this in the past. We went into Bosnia. We were supposed to be there 9 months and be out by Christ-mas. That is 5 years ago this Christ-mas. We have had to add money every year, take money from various por-tions of our appropriations process and pay for the cost of Bosnia. We also have increased the level of our activity in the Iraq area. Even dur-ing the period of the Kosovo operation, there continue to be retaliatory strikes on Iraq because of the their failure to abide by the cease-fire agreement. In South Korea, the North Koreans are continuing to rattle the cage, as far as we are concerned, and we are on a high level of alert in that area. What I am telling the Senate again is this bill reflects those pressures on our defense forces. We want those people who are defending this country to know we support them when they are out there in the field representing our interests. The funds provided in excess of the President's request are contin-gency emergency appropriations for agriculture, for defense, for FEMA and for the refugees. The amounts added by the House and the Senate can only be submitted if the President declares an emergency requirement exists. We are going to get into that question of the emergency requirement here when the Senator from Texas raises his point of order. But we worked in conference very hard to assure adequate resources will be available through the remain-der of this fiscal year to meet the needs in the areas we visited, in the Kosovo area, and to meet the needs of the mili-tary worldwide. Some of our systems are being taken from the areas I have described before\u2014from South Korea, even from Bosnia and from Iraq\u2014to move them into the area of the conduct of the hostilities in and around Kosovo and Serbia. Those funds that are need-ed on a global basis are in this bill. Some of them, as we know, the Presi-dent did not request. We believe we have taken action. Hopefully we will not have to see an-other emergency supplemental with re-gard to the conduct of the Kosovo oper-ation during the period of time we will be working on the regular appropria-tions bills for the year 2000. In effect, we have reached across and gone in\u2014 probably this bill should be able to carry us, at the very least to the end of this current calendar year. The initial requests of the President took us to the end of the fiscal year on September 30. I am happy to inform the Senate I am told today the President will sign this bill as soon as it reaches his desk. He has specifically asked us to com-plete our work and pass the bill today. I understand he has a trip planned and it would be to everyone's advantage if we get this bill down to him today and VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5645 May 20, 1999 have it signed. Therefore, I am pleased we do have the unanimous consent which does allow us to vote on this bill. I take it that will be sometime around 3:20 we will vote on the bill. I do earnestly urge every Member of the Senate to vote for this conference report. To not vote for this conference report because of some difference, be-cause of the process, would send the wrong message to the young men and women who represent this country in uniform. One of the things that im-pressed me when I was on the trips, both to Bosnia and into the Kosovo area, was if you go into the tents where these young people are living when they are deployed, do you know what you find? You find computers. They are on the Internet. Right now, some of them out there will be picking up just the words I am saying. We are not back in the period, like when I served in World War II in China, when we did not hear from home but maybe once or twice a month at the most. We had to really just search to find news of what was going on at home and we were starved for news from home. These people are force fed news from home and many times what they see are rumors that come across the Internet. We don't need any more rumors going out to the men and women serving in the Armed Forces overseas. In this bill is the pay raise. We are committed that the money is there for the pay raise. We have initi-ated the concept of reforming the re-tirement system, which was one of the gripes we heard last year both in Bos-nia and Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. This is a bill the men and women of the armed services are watching. They are going to watch how you vote on this bill. And they should. It is not time for petty differences over process or committee jurisdiction. This is a time to act and give the people in the Armed Forces the money they need so they know they will have the systems and they will have the protections they need when they go in harm's way at the request of the Commander in Chief. I urge we not only vote to pass this bill, but Senators listen carefully to this point of order the Senator from Texas will raise, as it is raised against specific provisions of this bill. Mr. President, there is no question in my mind, as we look at this bill, it is a different bill. When I woke up this morning, I looked in Roll Call and I was interested to see the statistics on supplemental appropriations, 1976 through 1996. We had no supplementals in 1995. We had one supplemental in 1996. I will get that number for 1997. People who are saying we are having too many supplementals\u2014they are just wrong. We have not had too many supplementals. We go through a proc-ess of predicting how much money we will need. The departments of the Gov-ernment start the process of sending their requests to the President through their agencies. They come up in the de-partment, they go to the Office of Man-agement and Budget, the President fi- nally gets them sometime in Sep-tember of the year before. In January or February, the beginning of the year, the President submits his budget which will be made available the following September, following October, going through the September of the next year. In other words, what I am saying is this is the process. The money we are spending now on a routine basis started through the agencies in the fall of 1997, came into the departments in the spring of 1998, went through the Presi-dent's process and got to OMB and were presented to us, in terms of a process, to have a bill for the year 2000 presented to us and considered in 1999. This appropriations process is a long process. I hope I have not shortened it. But it is a very long process. In the process of trying to estimate the needs, things are overlooked, concepts are de-veloped and, particularly in the defense field, new involvements of our military erupt. Kosovo is a good example. We had no knowledge we would have that kind of operation, an immense oper-ation now, probably the largest engage-ment we have had, in terms of this type of crisis, since the Persian Gulf war. Actually, I think before we are over, it may be more expensive than the Persian Gulf war was to the United States. I recognize the comments that are coming, particularly from my side of the aisle, about greater consistency in our appropriations process. I want peo-ple to look at the record. We have not had an excess of supplementals. We had an omnibus bill last fall, and most of the comments made on this floor are about the two omnibus bills that ended up the fiscal year\u2014the one my prede-cessor, Senator Hatfield, was involved with and the one last year with which I was involved. In both instances, if the Senators look carefully, they will find the ap-propriations process reached a stale-mate, and the stalemate had to be re-solved on the leadership level with the President. That was not the two com-mittees that added that money. It was a negotiation with the President, in both instances, by the leadership of the House and Senate, and I commend them for it. We had to get out of that impasse or we would have had another impasse like we had previously when there was an attempt to shut down the Government. When this Government is at war, it is not going to be shut down on my watch. I want everyone to know that. We are not going to shut down the Gov-ernment when there is a war going on. We are not even going to suggest it. Anybody who does suggest it better un-derstand he or she will not be here for long. The American people will not stand for that. Their sons and daugh-ters are out fighting, and we ought to fight to get them the support they need. I am going to fight\u2014I am going to fight as hard as I can \u2014to get bills such as this through and keep funding the Department of Defense at the level it should be funded to assure their safe-ty\u2014not just normal safety\u2014but every single system we can adopt that will save the lives of the men and women in the armed services ought to be ap-proved. This is what this does. It gives them the money they need to carry through the remainder of this year. This year is going to be a very tough year. Any one of those other crises which are going on in Iraq, in Bosnia, in South Korea, or other places could erupt. I was told yesterday that we have people in the uniform of the United States in 93 different places throughout the globe now\u201493 different places\u2014and any one of those places could erupt again while this Kosovo conflict is ongoing. I do not want to hear anyone tell me that we have provided too much money. We have not provided too much money. If the money is not needed, I can guarantee you that this Secretary of Defense and this Chairman of the Joint Chiefs is not going to spend it. We have given them under this bill an enormous amount of discretion to spend the money. We have not ear-marked this money. We have suggested things in the report that we hope they will consider, but this is the money to meet the needs of protecting our men and women in the armed services abroad, and it has to be viewed on that basis. I urge every Member of the Senate to vote for it and to forget petty dif-ferences. I am delighted to yield now to my good friend from West Virginia, a part-ner in this process of trying to get this supplemental and emergency bill to the President. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from West Virginia. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Alaska, the senior Senator, Mr. T EDSTEVENS , the manager of the bill and the chair-man of the Appropriations Committee. He is my longtime friend. I have served many, many years in the Senate and on the Appropriations Committee and on various subcommittees of the Ap-propriations Committee with Senator S TEVENS . He was fair and he was dedicated to the positions of the Senate throughout the discussions on the supplemental appropriations bill when it was in con-ference with the other body. He stood up for the Senate's positions, and he was remarkably effective. I am proud to associate myself with him. First of all, he is a gentleman. His word is his bond. His handshake is his bond. I like that. He is not so partisan that partisan- ship overrides everything else. We are all partisan here to an extent, but to some of us party is not everything, party is not even the top thing. Party is important, but there are other things even more important. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5646 May 20, 1999 Mr. President, I intend to support this emergency supplemental con-ference report accompanying H.R. 1141. It is the result of a long and difficult conference with the House of Rep-resentatives. There are a number of matters in this agreement that I do not support, and there is one provision which is not included in the agreement but which I believe was as deserving as any emergency contained in the con-ference agreement. That provision is the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program. Sen-ators will recall that the Senate sub-stitute to H.R. 1141 included the amendment that I offered to establish a 2-year $1 billion loan guarantee pro-gram to assist the more than 10,000 U.S. steelworkers who have already lost their jobs as a result of a huge in-flux of cheap and illegally dumped steel during 1998, last year. This matter had strong support by the Senate conferees during the House- Senate conference. After a thorough discussion of the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program, the House conferees voted to accept this Senate provision. Not all of the House con-ferees. All the House Democratic con-ferees and three of the Republican con-ferees voted to accept this provision. However, that vote was subsequently overturned the next day, and the Emer-gency Steel Loan Guarantee Program remained a matter of contention until the very end of the conference. In order to expedite the completion of this very important emergency bill, not everything which I support in the Senate, but I am going to support the bill, and because of the need to get it to the President as quickly as possible, I agreed to drop the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program in return for a commitment from the House and Senate congressional leadership that this loan guarantee provision would be brought up as a freestanding emer-gency appropriations bill in the very near future. Pursuant to that agreement, I hope and expect that such an appropriations bill will be brought up in the Senate prior to the upcoming Memorial Day recess. I hope, because it is vitally im-portant, that we act expeditiously, this being a real emergency. The plight of many of the steel com- panies in this country is serious. The Speaker of the House has agreed to per-mit a motion to go to conference with-in 1 week of receiving the Senate- passed bill and has agreed to allow nor-mal appropriations conferees to be ap-pointed and to permit the resulting conference report to be brought up be-fore the Houses. Subsequent to Senate adoption of the substitute on H.R. 1141, the House Ap-propriations Committee marked up a second emergency supplemental appro-priations bill to provide emergency funding principally to support the mili-tary operations, refugee relief, and hu-manitarian assistance relating to the conflict in Kosovo and for military op-erations in Southwest Asia for fiscal year 1999. In light of the House action in rela- tion to the Kosovo supplemental, and in hopes of being able to move both the Central American emergency spending bill, H.R. 1141, as well as the emergency funding for Kosovo, it was determined by the joint leadership that the Kosovo funding should be taken up directly by the House-Senate conferees on H.R. 1141. As a consequence, the Senate Ap-propriations Committee never marked up the funding measure for Kosovo, nor did the Senate have an opportunity to debate that measure at all\u2014no oppor-tunity to amend it, no opportunity to debate it, no opportunity to vote it up or down. In other words, the first time the Kosovo funding has been before the Senate is today in the form of this con-ference agreement on H.R. 1141. I generally do not support the han- dling of appropriations matters in a manner that does not allow the Senate to work its will on each of the issues in appropriations bills, but in this in-stance, I agreed to allow this procedure to be followed because of the impor-tance of the matters contained in this particular conference report. This conference agreement contains appropriations totaling some $15 bil-lion, of which $10.9 billion is for the support of our men and women in uni-form in Kosovo and Southwest Asia and $1.1 billion is for Kosovo-related humanitarian assistance. These amounts represent an increase of $6 bil-lion\u2014$6 billion\u2014above the President's request for Kosovo-related in emergency fund-ing above the President's request con-tains a congressional emergency des-ignation, but will only be available for obligation if the President agrees with that emergency designation, only if the President also requests these funds and declares them emergency spending. In addition to the $12 billion for our Kosovo-related expenditures, both in military and humanitarian assistance, the pending measure also includes $574 million in emergency agriculture as-sistance programs, some $420 million higher than the administration's re-quest. For the victims of Hurricane Mitch in Central America and the Car-ibbean, the conference agreement in-cludes $983 million, of which $216 mil-lion is to replenish Department of Jus-tice operation and maintenance ac-counts which were used to provide im-mediate relief to the hurricane vic-tims. Finally, the agreement contains $900 million in emergency funding for FEMA in order to address the needs of the American people who suffered from the recent tornadoes in Kansas, Okla-homa, Texas, and Tennessee. Mr. President, as I have stated, this was a very difficult conference that consumed many days and late nights to reach agreement. This was the first time that the present chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Mr. B ILLYOUNG of Florida, had an oppor- tunity to serve as chairman of the con-ference. I must say that he performed his responsibilities very capably. Dur-ing the many contentious debates that took place, he was always fair and evenhanded and respectful of all mem-bers of the conference, just like our own chairman, Senator S TEVENS . Yet, at the same time, he displayed the nec-essary firmness in order to keep the conference moving toward completion. So, I compliment Chairman B ILL YOUNG for his excellent work on this difficult conference. Let me again compliment Senator STEVENS , but also I compliment the ranking member of the House Appro-priations Committee, Mr. D AVID OBEY, whom one will never find asleep at the switch. He is always there. He is al-ways alert, combative enough, to be sure, and loyal to his own body, the House of Representatives, and the Democrats whom he represented in the conference. His work is always effec-tive and very capable. In closing, let me again say that Chairman S TEVENS stoutly defended the Senate position on all of the mat-ters throughout the conference and also made certain that all Senate con-ferees were able to express their view on each of the issues. I hope that the Senate will support the conference report. As I say, there are some things in it I do not like, some things that were left out of it that I very much wanted and believe in and believe constitute as much of an emergency as some of the other items that are designated as such in the con-ference report. But I want to support this. I urge all Senators to support it. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Arizona. Mr. M CCAIN. Mr. President, thank you. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent that a statement of mine con-cerning the objectionable provisions contained in the bill be made part of the R ECORD following my remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See Exhibit 1.) Mr. M CCAIN. Mr. President, as a former Member of Congress once said, ''Every disaster is an opportunity.'' This bill proves that statement re-mains true today. Scattered throughout this bill, which was supposed to be for emergencies only, is more than $1.2 billion in non- emergency, garden-variety, pork-barrel spending. When the Senate passed this bill just two months ago, I could find only $85 million in low-priority, unnec-essary, or wasteful spending. By the time the conferees were done with it, the waste had grown by a factor of 14- 14 times more pork-barrel spending was deemed worthy of inclusion in this con-ference bill. Mr. President, I have compiled a list of the numerous add-ons earmarks, and special exemptions in this bill. Now, I know that some of these programs may well prove meritorious, but there is no VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5647 May 20, 1999 way for us to determine their merit be- cause the process for doing so has been circumvented in this bill. For example, the bill contains $1.5 million to purchase water to maintain sufficient water levels for fish and wildlife purposes at San Carlos Lake in Arizona, and an earmark of $750,000 for the Southwest Border anti-drug efforts. I know that these are important pro-grams, but are they the most impor-tant programs in my state? The proc-ess by which these two earmarks were added in conference on this bill makes it impossible to assess the relative merit of these programs against all other priority needs in Arizona and across the nation. The normal merit-based review proc- ess, which requires authorization and appropriation, was not followed, and these programs were simply added to this so-called ''emergency'' bill. The usual ''checks and balances'' were just thrown out the window. Once again, I have to object to in- cluding programs in appropriations bills that have not been authorized. The Commerce Committee has jurisdic-tion over the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Yet, without even seek-ing, much less obtaining authorization from the Commerce Committee, the appropriations put $38 million in this bill for the CPB to buy a new satellite. I have raised this issue before. There is a good reason for the two-tiered proc-ess that requires an authorization be-fore appropriating any money for a program\u2014to eliminate unnecessary or low-priority spending of taxpayer dol-lars. That process clearly was cir-cumvented in this bill. This bill contains the usual earmarks for specific amounts of money of spe-cial-interest projects, such as: An emergency earmark of $26 million to compensate Dungeness crab fisher-man, fish processors, fishing crew members, communities and others neg-atively affected by restrictions on fish-ing in Glacier Bay National Park in Alaska. Emergency earmarks of $3.7 million for a House page dorm and $1.8 million for renovations in the O'Neill House Of-fice Building, which were added in con-ference. $3 million earmarked for water infra- structure needs at Grand Isle, Lou-isiana, again added in conference. An emergency infusion of $70 million into the livestock assistance program, which is redefined to include reindeer. Mr. President, I am sure that Santa Clause is happy today although even he would blush not only at the process but the amount of money that is included in this legislation. Then there are the many objection- able provisions that have no direct monetary effect on the bill, but you can be sure there is a financial benefit to someone back home. For example: Apparently, last year when we added millions of dollars to help maple pro-ducers replace taps damaged in ice storms in the Northeast, we added a bit too much money. This bill directs that leftover money be used for restoration of stream banks and maybe repairing fire damage in Nebraska. The media has reported extensively on a provision (which was added in con-ference) allowing the Crown Jewel mine project in Washington State to deposit mining waste on more than the five acres surrounding the mine than is currently permitted. What hasn't been reported is that this language also re-verses for several months any earlier permit denials for any other mining op-erations that were denied based on the five-acre millsite limit. The bill contains language making permanent the prohibition on new fish-ing vessels participating in herring and mackerel fishing in the Atlantic\u2014a protectionist policy that was slipped in last year's bill and is now, apparently, going to become permanent. The bill contains another provision that provides a special, lifetime exemp-tion from vessel length limitations for a fishing vessel that is currently oper-ating in the Gulf of Mexico or along the south Atlantic Coast fishing for menhaden\u2014an issue that should be dealt with by the authorizing com-mittee, the Commerce Committee. The report directs that three facili- ties be built to house non-returnable criminal aliens in the custody of the INS\u2014facilities which are much-need-ed\u2014but then the conferees decided to go one step further and direct that one facility had to be built in the mid-At-lantic region. Last year's 1999 Transportation ap- propriations bill earmarked funding for a feasibility study for commuter rail service in the Cleveland-Akron-Canton area, and the conference report ex-pands on the use of those funds to allow purchase of rights-of-way for a rail project before the feasibility of the project has even been determined. There are many more low-priority, wasteful, and unnecessary projects on the 5-page list I have compiled, and is included in the R ECORD . Most of these add-ons are listed as ''emergencies'' in this bill. Do these programs really sound like emer-gencies to you? A small number are offset by cuts in other spending, but that doesn't make it right to include them in a non- amendable bill that circumvents the appropriate merit-based selection proc-ess of selecting the highest priority projects. Some of these programs, like the page dorm, were not even in the bills that passed the Senate and House. They were simply thrown into this bill in conference, at the last minute, in a bill that cannot be amended or modi-fied in any way. For the Coast Guard, this bill pre- sented the opportunity to pick up an-other $200 million for operating ex-penses and readiness. This, too, was a last-minute add in conference of ''emergency'' funding\u2014again, an issue for the Commerce Committee to con-sider. I also want to note with interest the apparent prescience of the appropri-ators in including an additional $528 million in unrequested emergency funding, for ''any disaster events which occur in the remaining months of the fiscal year.'' Apparently, the appropri-ators have some inkling that bad things are going to happen in the next five months. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues understand that designating spending as an ''emergency'' doesn't make it free. It still has to be paid for. The fact is that most of the pork-barrel spend-ing in this bill comes straight out of the Social Security Trust Fund. At a time when the American people are worried about the fiscal health of So-cial Security, worried about whether Social Security will be there when they retire, it defies logic that we are tak-ing money out of the Trust Fund for these projects. The Trust Fund is esti-mated to be bankrupt by the year 2032, and taking another billion dollars out of it clearly accelerates that fiscal cri-sis. That is exactly the opposite of what we should be doing, which is tak-ing the Trust Fund off-budget and put-ting more money into it to ensure ben-efits will be paid, as promised, to all Americans who have worked and paid into the Social Security system. Mr. President, disasters should not be opportunities. It seems the Congress may still be suffering from ''surplus fever,'' a giddy lack of fiscal discipline because of projected budget surpluses into the foreseeable future. Last year, we spent $20 billion of the Social Secu-rity surplus for wasteful spending in the omnibus appropriations bill. I voted against the omnibus bill last year, and I will vote against this bill. This bill is a betrayal of our responsi- bility to spend the taxpayers' dollars responsibly and enact laws and policies that reflect the best interests of all Americans, rather than the special in-terests of a few. I cannot support a bill that makes a mockery of the Congress' power of the purse and contributes to Americans' growing lack of faith in their Government. Finally, I was very pleased to see the other Senators come to the floor. We cannot continue this practice of adding appropriations in conference. We can-not continue to circumvent the author-ization process. I identified some 30 in-stances in last year's bill. It will stop, sooner or later. We promised the Amer-ican people when we regained the ma-jority we would not do this kind of thing, this kind of money, in this kind of unauthorized authorizations that circumvent the committee process. I find it offensive as a committee chairman. Most of all, I find it offen-sive as an American citizen who also pays his taxes. I assure Members and my friends on the Appropriations Committee, we in-tend to take additional measures in the appropriations process. If appropria-tions bills come to this floor without proper authorization of expenditures of VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, SENATE S5648 May 20, 1999 money or authorizations that are not agreed to by the committee chairmen who are authorizers, there are going to be a lot of problems around here. Last fall, when we added $21 billion in unnecessary spending, some 30-odd reauthorizations, I said at that time in a letter to the distinguished chairman and my friend on the Appropriations Committee that I will not stand for it any further. I believe there are a whole lot of Senators on both sides of the aisle who are tired of this process. I say that with all due respect for the dedication, the difficulties and the ob-stacles that the chairman of the Appro-priations Committee and other appro-priators have as they go through a very difficult process, but it must stop. I yield back the remainder of my time.

(Unrequested) Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am surprised by some of the items listed in the Senator's statement. This bill is both a supplemental and an emergency appropriations bill. A supplemental appropriations bill that was submitted by the President in March contained a request for $48 mil-lion to replace the National Public Radio satellite system. It is in this bill not as an emergency but as a supple-mental appropriation. When we passed this bill in March, the Senate version of this bill contained $18 million for the satellite system. That was less than the President's request. The President made that request because the Public Radio system satellite failed and radio programs are currently being sent through an emergency backup satellite that will not be available until around the middle of September, early fall. The supplemental funding was re-quested by the President and approved by the Senate at the level of $18 mil-lion. The House insisted on the full $48 million. It is an item that is not des-ignated as an emergency. There are a series of other misunder- standings, I think, with regard to this bill, and I will be happy to discuss them with the Senator from Arizona later. I don't disagree with him about legislation on appropriations bills. The point of order under the rules that were previously in place against legis-lation on the appropriations bills was destroyed through a maneuver here on the floor of the Senate before my be-coming chairman. We have had a tough time trying to get that put back into our system. I will be happy to help re-store the point of order against legisla-tion. I don't look with favor on the omni- bus process that occurred last fall and occurred once before I became chair-man. But clearly, my job is to carry forward the bills as they come out of the Senate and out of the House and out of the conference by a majority vote. Under the current circumstances, there is not a point of order in the Sen-ate on legislation against appropria-tions. Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from California. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I rise to make a brief statement. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if I might just confer. How much time does the Senator from California wish? Mrs. FEINSTEIN. About 5 minutes. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished and very able senior Senator from the State of California, which is larger than all the nations of the globe except, how many? Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much. Mr. BYRD. Are there six nations that are larger than California? Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct. Mr. BYRD. Six nations that are larg- er than California. So the two Cali-fornia Senators really are here rep-resenting a State that is larger than all of the nations of the world except six. I thank the distinguished Senator and I yield the floor. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distin- guished ranking member. I appreciate his comments about my State. I also compliment both the ranking member and the chairman of the committee for their drive, for their motivation, and for their staying power to get this con-ference report done. Mr. President, the room was crowded. The hours were long. The views were sometimes cantankerous. But both the chairman and the ranking member, I think, were steadfast in the desire to produce a conference report which could, in fact, be approved by both bod-ies. I also pay tribute to the chairman from the House, Mr. Y OUNG . I had never seen him preside before. What I ob-served, which I think is well worth not-ing, was his fairness, his equanimity, and really his ability to move the proc-ess along which, without rankling, can be a very diverse membership. I say the same for Mr. O BEY, who really was steadfast in pursuing his own views. I support this report. It contains the $12 billion for Kosovo. I am especially pleased to note that the supplemental contains funding for the documenta-tion of war crimes, including rapes that appear to have been committed as part of Serbia's brutal campaign of eth-nic cleansing. As the ranking member and the chairman have pointed out, it contains the much-needed disaster as-sistance and the $574 million in agricul-tural funding to provide a measure of assistance to very hard-pressed farmers throughout this great country. I do want to speak about one small item. As we debate the conference re-port on the emergency supplemental appropriations bill, I want to express my concerns about the inclusion of a ''hold harmless'' provision for what are called concentration grants authorized by Title I of the Elementary and Sec-ondary Education Act. In chapter 5, on page 91 of the con- ference report (Report 106-143), the con-ferees included $56.4 million for Title I concentration grants ''to direct the De-partment of Education to hold harm-less all school districts that received Title I concentration grants in fiscal year 1998.* * *'' The report goes on to say, ''Neither the House nor the Senate bills contained these provisions.'' This provision is very disturbing for several reasons. First, it was not included in either the House or Senate bills. Therefore, it has not been considered by the author- izing committees of either house. It has not been considered by the appro-priations committees of either house. There have been no hearings. It has not gone through the normal deliberative process under which we hear from ex-perts, weigh the pros and cons and cast votes. Quite frankly, this provision ap-peared ''in the dark of night.'' Second, the hold harmless provision contravenes an important provision of the law, known as the census update, a requirement in law that the U.S. De-partment of Education must allocate Title I funds based on the newest child poverty figures, figures that are up-dated every two years. Congress adopt-ed the census update requirement in 1994 so that Title I funds\u2014which the law says are to help disadvantaged children\u2014truly follow the child, that dollars be determined generally by the number of children who are eligible. The holdharmless provision in this bill before us, guaranteeing that school dis-tricts that got funds in 1998 will get funds in 1999, even if their number of poor children has declined, violates the requirement that funds be allocated based on the most recent child poverty data available. The provision in this bill effectively rewards ''incumbents,'' despite their number of poor children, despite merit or need. Third, this provision disregards Title I's eligibility requirements. Title I con-centration grants are supposed to be especially targeted to concentrations of poor children, under the law. Dis-tricts that have poor children exceed-ing 6,500 or 15% of their total school- aged children are eligible for these grants, which are in addition to the ''regular,'' basic Title I grants. Guaran-teeing funds to districts, no matter what the number or percent of poor children in those districts, spreads lim-ited funds to districts that are not eli-gible because they do not have con-centrations of poverty. It effectively takes away funds from districts that do have high concentrations of poor chil-dren. It overrides the eligibility re-quirements we have set and agreed on in law. In my state, some school districts could benefit from this ''hold harm-less'' provision because the number of poor children changed; it went below the eligibility threshold of the Title I concentration grants program. Like most Senators, I do not want any school district in my state to lose edu-cation funds. But we either have rules or we don't. We have eligibility criteria or we don't. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5650 May 20, 1999 If the current eligibility rules are wrong or are not working, we should change them in the authorizing proc-ess, a review which the Health and Education Committee is currently un-dertaking. We should not set up eligi-bility rules and then flagrantly ignore them, override them or ''freeze'' in place funds to districts that do not meet the requirements. We should not rewrite the rules in the ''dark of night'' outside the normal legislative process. Fourth, this provision violates the principle that funds should follow the child. Title I was created for poor, dis-advantaged children. That is its funda-mental purpose and funding to states is determined largely by the number of poor children, children that all agree have great educational needs. This amendment sends funds to districts merely because they got funds in the previous year, not because the districts have needy children and not in propor-tion to the number of poor children they have. Finally, this provision is very unfair to states like mine that have a very high growth rate in the number of poor children. In California, the number of poor children grew by 52 percent from 1990 to 1995. In Arizona, poor children grew 38 percent from 1990 to 1995. In Georgia, 35 percent. In Nevada, 56 per-cent. That is why Congress included a requirement for a child poverty update. This amendment is very unfair to those children. This amendment takes the funds away from the poor children for which the funds were intended. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator's 5 minutes have expired. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may have 30 seconds to wrap up. Mr. BYRD. I yield an additional minute. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distin- guished ranking member. Even though it ''freezes in'' funding to districts\u2014including some in my state\u2014that got funds last year, even though they do not qualify, it makes a mockery of the basic purpose of the Title I program, its eligibility rules and the requirement to use recent pov-erty data. If Congress continues to override these basic rules of the au-thorizing law, we are effectively oper-ating with no rules, or at least, con-stantly changing rules. Districts will not know whether they are eligible or what they can or cannot count on. This is just plain wrong. In my state, even though 39 districts would have their funding ''frozen in'' by this provision, next year, California will have 166 new school districts that will become eligi-ble. If these ''hold harmlesses'' keep appearing in the dark of night, these eligible districts, with concentrations of poor children, could be deprived of funds to which they are entitled. Because this is a conference report, under our procedures, I am not allowed to offer an amendment to delete this provision. But let me put my colleagues on no- tice that I find this provision and this procedure very objectionable. I hope my colleagues will join me in ending this practice so that our chil-dren can get the education Congress in-tended in creating the Title I program in the first place. I thank the Chair, and I thank the ranking member. Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Washington. Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am authorized to yield myself 5 minutes off of the time of Senator S TEVENS . Eleven billion dollars in this bill are earmarked to pay for the costs of the war in the Balkans and its con-sequences, direct and indirect. That war was begun in folly and has been conducted since with an almost incred-ible degree of incompetence. I have op-posed the war from the beginning and will not support it now. The conflict was begun because of Serbia's refusal to sign an agreement granting autonomy to the people of Kosovo and protecting its citizens. Other demands, including the free right of NATO troops to travel through any part of Yugoslavia, were impossible for any sovereign nation to agree to. Our goals were worthy. But they were not of sufficient importance to vital American interests to warrant the use of our armed forces in combat. This proposition is perhaps best illus-trated by the President's refusal to use all of the means necessary to attain his goals, choosing to cause death and de-struction to the Serbs, and suffering, dislocation, and death to the very peo-ple we purport to protect, than to risk American lives in order to succeed. This is no way to wage a war. But vital American interests have been seriously and adversely affected by the war itself. We have destabilized Macedonia and Montenegro, and per-haps other nations in the Balkans as well. We have damaged relations with Russia and may have pushed it along the road to reaction. We have put our-selves on the defensive with respect to China when we should have the high ground in many of our differences. We have fueled anti-American sentiment around the world. If we win, we get to occupy Kosovo for a generation and to spend billions rebuilding it; if we lose, we are humili-ated and NATO is weakened. In addition, this war appropriation comes to the Senate in a form in which it cannot be amended. I, for one, am de-nied the opportunity to attempt to ear-mark a modest portion of this money to arm the Kosovo Albanian rebels. It is inconceivable that we should trigger this ethnic cleansing, refuse to inter-vene on the ground to defend the Kosovo Albanians, fail even to attack their persecutors effectively, and top it off by refusing to aid those who wish to fight for their own liberties. Finally, of course, this entire emer- gency appropriation comes straight out of our Social Security surplus. I am not sure that the American people are at all aware of this fact. I cannot be-lieve that they would support it. At my behest, the conference committee added managers' language calling for the restoration of this borrowing to the Social Security Trust Fund out of fu-ture general fund surpluses. But the language is not mandatory, and may well be ignored. We should not use So-cial Security to pay for a war in the Balkans. For these reasons, and in spite of its many good and important provisions on other issues, I oppose this supple-mental appropriations bill. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the emergency appropriations bill because it is an emergency, it is necessary. I have been reading all of the press reports about the bill and criticisms of the bill be-cause it is too large or perhaps too much money has been spent on one area or another. But the fact is, we have emergencies in our country that are not covered by the budget. We have had more emergencies in our agri-culture area than we ever could have foreseen. You can't pick up the paper that you don't read about a terrible tragic tornado, and we are coming into hurricane season. So we are putting more money into FEMA. We have had floods in my home State. We must deal with these as they occur, and clearly on an emergency basis. A good part of this bill is for agri- culture. We are also helping our neigh-bors in Central America who were rav-aged with a terrible hurricane and tor-nadoes. We are trying to do the things we have promised we would do. But since we started this emergency appro-priation, we have also had a new emer-gency, and that is the situation in Kosovo. We are seeing, every day, what is happening there. Mr. President, it is no secret that I have spoken out strongly against the way we got into this Kosovo operation. I have spoken out against going into an operation when we didn't have a good contingency plan. I have spoken out against so much of our policy in the Balkans. I just came back from the Balkans, just over the weekend, and I met with our soldiers on the airfield in Albania, the ones who are going to be supporting our humanitarian effort and, hopefully, be part of our defenses there, whatever we may do. I went to Aviano, Italy, and met with the troops who are doing so many of these air op-erations that we are seeing day after day after day. And, of course, there is no question that our troops are doing a great job. They don't make the policy; they just do the mission they are VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5651 May 20, 1999 given. Nobody can question their sin- cerity, their great attitude, and their commitment to our country. You will never meet a young man or woman in the military who isn't there because they love our country. So when I think about this supple- mental appropriation\u2014and I know I have spoken against the mission itself, the way it has come about\u2014and I re-member looking into the eyes of the young men and women who are on the front line, I think, now, can I vote not to give the money to them to have the equipment they need to do the training they need, to have the incentives that they need to be doing a very tough job in a very tough neighborhood? Well, the answer is no, I can't vote against paying for their security, because they are the security for me and my family and for every one of us who is lucky enough to live in the greatest country on Earth. So they have volunteered to give their lives so that we may live in free-dom. Do you think for one minute I would vote not to give them the equip-ment they need to do that job? It would be unthinkable. So while we de-bate how we pay for it or who is re-sponsible, in the end, I am going to vote for this bill, because I am going to support the troops who are in the field. I am going to continue to argue with the administration that we need to learn the lessons about how this oper-ation has been handled, and I think we will. I think there is a glimmer of hope that perhaps Mr. Milosevic has seen that we are going to win and pro-longing it will only hurt his own peo-ple. So there is a glimmer of hope, and a glimmer of hope is better than total darkness. I think we need to seize on that glimmer of hope and try to come to the first agreement that we must have from Mr. Milosevic\u2014that he will stop the atrocities against the people of Kosovo. I just visited with the people of Kosovo. I visited with them in Mac-edonia. I visited with them in Albania. Those people have been through more than any one of us will ever know or understand. What I want now is the atrocities to stop for the ones who are still there. The ones we met with are in refugee camps. They are not com-fortable, but they are safe. I want to try to help the people who are still in Kosovo, and the atrocities on them to stop so that we can then allow the peo-ple who have fled their country in ter-ror to be able to go back in and rebuild their homes, rebuild their economy, so that they will be able to have a liveli-hood, so that they will be able to raise their children in their homeland with-out fear of a despot who would commit the atrocities that there is no question in my mind have been committed in the last 6 months and, indeed, for many years in this part of the world. So, Mr. President, while we are de- bating policy, while we are debating from where the money is going to come all of which is legitimate debate, while we are talking to each other about our principles, which is our right to do, but at the end of the day, it is most impor-tant that we have the emergency ap-propriations which would give our kids who are on the front line and their commanders everything they need so as to know that we are not going to pull the rug out from under them, that they will have the equipment, they will have the airplanes, they will have the helicopters for their own security while they are protecting yours and mine. So let's talk policy. Let's talk about never going into an operation like this again without a contingency plan. Let's talk about the treasure we have spent in this country to try to solve this problem. And let's not stop with Kosovo, because the money and the troops that we have put in harm's way cannot be lost for us to put a Band-Aid on Kosovo. Let's finish this job now. But when we have stopped the atroc- ities and when the Serb troops have started leaving Kosovo, and when an international peacekeeping force moves in, let's take the opportunity, let's seize the moment to do something bigger than putting a Band-Aid on Kosovo. Let's look at the Balkans and do what we can to try to help them form areas of government that have to change so that those people will be able to have jobs, start farming their land, to live in security. That is what I want for the Balkans. But continuing to say we can amal- gamate the Balkans as if they were America is not going to have a long- term chance for success, because we don't understand what they have just been through in the last 5 years. We don't understand what it would be like to force people to live next door to each other when their mothers have been raped, when their fathers have been brutally murdered, when their families have had to flee in terror. Let's start today by supporting our troops. Let's start today by keeping open the glimmer of hope for peace. And then let's take one step at a time to try to help these people become a contributing part of Europe so that they can do what every one of us wants to do; that is, live in peace and free-dom, to have jobs, to support our fami-lies, and to give our kids a better chance than we have. That is what the Kosovar Albanians want. It is what the Serbs want. They are the good people of Serbia\u2014not President Milosevic. That is what the Moslems in Bosnia want. That is what the Croats want. It is what the Albanians want. And they should be able to have it. That should be our goal. I am going to support this bill. I am not going to say there are not legiti-mate differences about certain parts of it. Sure there are. That is why 100 of us are elected independently to represent the views we have\u2014the views of our States. But we are required to come to-gether. I hope the Senate will do the right thing and come together to do what is right for the farmers who are hurting, for the people in Central America who are hurting, for the peo-ple in the Balkans who are hurting, to help promote peace in the Middle East, and to continue to appreciate that we live in the greatest nation on Earth. We need to make sure we keep the se-curity and the freedom of our country on our watch. It is our responsibility to pass this bill and talk about the policy and talk about our differences, and our Con-stitution that provided that we do this. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Wisconsin. Who yields time? Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator wish? Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask for 15 minutes. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Wisconsin is recognized to speak for 15 minutes. Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank the Sen-ator from West Virginia. Mr. President, I rise to offer some comments on the emergency spending bill we have before us. Many of us had hoped that the almost grotesque expe-rience of last year's omnibus appro-priations bill might have shamed Con-gress into refraining from the kind of fiscally irresponsible spending and ca-tering to special interests that charac-terized that legislation. Apparently, it was a vain hope. We are back at the same disgraceful work barely seven months later. Mr. President, few would argue the need for many of the core provisions of the legislation, especially the urgently needed humanitarian relief in Central America, our current military and hu-manitarian operations in the Balkans, and for victims of natural disasters here at home. Regrettably, those le-gitimate provisions are completely eclipsed by dozens of others that are at best highly questionable and at worst grossly irresponsible. Mr. President, first and foremost among this latter group are the bil-lions in additional funding for the mili-tary that was not requested by the ad-ministration. Mr. President, to say there is a dou- ble standard when it comes to fiscal prudence in Congress is to say the ocean is damp. We saw it last year in the omnibus appropriations bill, we saw it again when this body took up and passed an unfunded military pay and retirement increase even before we had passed a budget resolution, we saw it still again during the budget resolu-tion when military spending received a special exemption from the tough new emergency spending rules we adopted, and sadly, we see it now in this bill. As has been noted by others, includ- ing my distinguished colleague from the other House, Wisconsin Represent-ative D AVID OBEY, what we are prob- ably witnessing is an effort to load as VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5652 May 20, 1999 much military spending into this bill under the pretext of an emergency in order to make room for special interest military spending provisions in the De-fense appropriations bill later this summer. Mr. President, put simply, this emer- gency supplemental measure uses So-cial Security Trust Fund revenues to help lard up an already corpulent de-fense budget. Almost as troubling as this reckless use of Social Security revenues to pay for the military budget is that this technique isn't an exception. It has be-come the custom. Mr. President, our budget caps have become a sham. We agree to those tough caps with great acclaim and fan-fare, only to circumvent them casually on a regular basis with the emergency provisions of our budget rules. Mr. President, as much as I oppose raising the budget caps, it would be far better if Congress and the White House were to raise those caps in an honest and open manner, than to continue the pretense that the caps have meaning only to circumvent them through the abuse\u2014I say ''abuse''\u2014of the emer-gency funding designation. Mr. President, while the doubling of the military budget request is cer-tainly the dominant flaw in this bill, there are other provisions that deserve notice as well. They represent what is most unseemly about the emergency appropriations process\u2014special inter-est provisions that relate to no true emergency, but avoid the scrutiny of the normal legislative process and in-stead capitalize on human suffering or an international crisis, finding their way onto what we have come to call must-pass bills. Mr. President, let me note that it may be that some of these extraneous provisions have merit. But they should be subject to the same fiscal scrutiny we ask of any proposal. They should be paid for. The standing committees should review and authorize these pro-posals, and the Appropriations Com-mittee should propose a level of fund-ing for each of them that makes sense in the context of the overall budget. Mr. President, by circumventing this process, the advocates of these provi-sions reveal their distrust of Congress and possibly their own apprehension that their provisions may not be able to gain passage on their merits. One such provision is the so-called Russian Leadership Program, a new program, Mr. President, newly author-ized by this legislation which also pro-vides it with $10 million in funding. I understand the program is intended to enable emerging political leaders of Russia to live here in the United States for a while to gain firsthand exposure to our country, our free market sys-tem, our democratic institutions, and other aspects of our government and day-to-day lives. Mr. President, offhand, that doesn't sound like it is necessarily a bad idea. I might be able to support such a pro-gram, though I would certainly want to know something more about it before endorsing still another new democracy building effort. But, Mr. President, this proposal has not gone through the nor-mal legislative process. It has not been held up to the scrutiny of a public re-view by the appropriate committees. Mr. President, if one were asked where the new Russian Leadership Pro-gram were to be housed, one might rea-sonably guess somewhere in the State Department, perhaps in USAID. Those a bit more familiar with the array of duplicate programs we have might stroke their chin wisely and suggest that it would probably be included in the National Endowment for Democ-racy, a quasi-governmental agency that many of us believe duplicates services provided elsewhere in govern-ment. But, Mr. President, if you guessed the State Department, or NED, you would be wrong. For the next year, this new Russian Leadership Program is to be housed in the Library of Congress. The Library of Congress, Mr. Presi-dent. Mr. President, as some may know, we already have numerous educational and other exchange programs with Russia. Agencies and Departments which have received funding from the Congress for exchange programs with Russia include, but are not limited to: the Departments of Commerce, De-fense, Education, Justice, State, and Treasury; the Agency for International Development, the Environmental Pro-tection Agency, the Federal Emer-gency Management Agency, the Fed-eral Trade Commission, the Marine Mammal Commission, the National Aeronautics and Space Commission, the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for Democ-racy, the National Science Foundation, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Peace Corps. Mr. President, I appreciate the tre- mendous impact that educational cul-tural exchanges have had on our rela-tionship with Russia. I have to wonder if we really need to create still another exchange program. Even if we deter-mine that the program has great merit, I think serious questions can be raised about whether this ought to be admin-istered by the Library of Congress. It doesn't end there. According to the authorizing language in this legisla-tion, the Librarian of Congress is given authority to waive any competitive bidding when entering into contracts to carry out this program. In other words, this program is effectively shielded from any expertise or effi-ciencies that might be brought to bear by existing firms or nongovernmental agencies with experience in this area. There we have it: In this bill, a brand-new program that has com-pletely avoided the review of the ap-propriate standing committees estab-lished in an agency, that is wholly in-appropriate, with virtually no restric-tions on its administration. This is a heck of a way to legislate. Of course, this is just one example, one of dozens of extraneous provisions that have been slipped into this emer-gency supplemental bill. I am not talk- ing about a lot of different bills; it is just what is going on in this bill. As others have noted, these unrelated riders have become business as usual. This is especially true with respect to antienvironmental policy. This is not the first time I have expressed con-cerns regarding legislative riders in ap-propriations legislation that would have a negative impact on our Nation's environment. I am sorry to say with respect to one of these policies, the de-laying of the implementation of new mining regulations, this is not even the first time such a rider has been in-serted into an appropriations bill. The merits of this policy, this very important policy relating to mining, should be debated at length on another occasion. I do want to note that the rules that safeguard our public lands with respect to mining badly need up-dating, if only to keep pace with the changing mining technology. One such technique, the use of sulfuric acid min-ing, caused grave concern 2 years ago in my own State when it was appro-priated for use in private lands in the neighboring Upper Peninsula of Michi-gan. Regulations also need to take into account other land uses that would be displaced by mining, and they need to do more to require meaningful cleanup. Currently, there is no requirement to restore mine lands to premining condi-tions. This leaves taxpayers holding the bag for the mining industry's mis-takes. Obviously, this kind of a change re- quires a full, careful, and open debate. It just can't get the kind of attention it needs when it is quietly slipped into an emergency supplemental appropria-tions bill that we are only going to de-bate for 3 hours. Of course, that is pre-cisely the reason the advocates of the rider have done it this way. They see their opportunity. They don't want a full and careful and open debate\u2014spe-cial interests that push this policy know it will do them best and they will get it done best behind closed doors, away from the light of open debate. In this connection, I think my col- leagues should be aware that the PACs associated with the members of the Na-tional Mining Association and other mining-related PACs contributed more than $29 million to congressional cam-paigns from January 1993 to December 1998. Mining soft money contributions totaled $10.6 million during the same 6- year period. Mr. President, that is nearly $40 million in campaign con-tributions in recent years from an in-dustry that stands to benefit from this rider that has been stuffed in this bill which we are only going to debate for 3 hours. And so it is with too many of these provisions. It should come as no surprise that a process characterized by secret nego-tiations and backroom deals should be VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5653 May 20, 1999 dominated by special interests and produce such questionable policy. These interests have succeeded in pre-senting Congress with a take-it-or- leave-it deal, and they are betting we will acquiesce for fear of delaying the true emergency assistance that I and everyone else have said is truly ur-gently needed. Of course, I realize this measure is likely to pass. I hope it does not. But I cannot endorse this package or the process that brought it to the floor by voting for it. I ask my colleagues to consider calling the bluff of the inter-ests that have succeeded in loading this bill up with extraneous matters that could never command a majority in Congress on their own. If we can defeat this measure and in- sist on a clean, true emergency bill, we just might be able to shame those who have participated in crafting it and maybe even prevent this kind of abuse in the future. I yield the floor. Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 20 minutes to speak against this bill. Mr. DOMENICI. I will not object. Mr. President, Senator S TEVENS has left the floor and I am here in his stead. Please enlighten the Senate as to the time situation pursuant to the unanimous consent request. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator S TEVENS has 39 minutes, Senator B YRD has 42 minutes, and Senator D ORGAN has 15 minutes. Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask for 20 minutes. Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Texas. Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, obvi- ously appropriating money is a very difficult task. I had the privilege for 7 years to serve on the Appropriations Committee. During that time I had the great privilege of serving as chairman of Commerce, State, Justice Appro-priations. Probably more than most Members of the Senate who don't cur-rently serve on Appropriations, I think I have some understanding of the dif-ficulty our colleagues have in appro-priating money. Let me also say that the funding issues are the most impor-tant and the most difficult issues we debate. I will share with my colleagues and anybody who might be following the debate an experience I had in 1980. I was a second-year Member of the House and I had been an economist prior to coming to Congress. I kept noticing that on the issues that really mattered\u2014the spending issues on amendments\u2014we were consistently los-ing on virtually every one of those votes. I ran sort of a running total for about 6 months on those votes. Here is what I concluded, as best I can remember. The average vote on spending that really mattered cost about $50 million. These were little add-on amendments that were voted on in 1980 in the House of Representatives. There were about 100 million taxpayers in 1980. So the average taxpayer was paying about 50 cents. The average ap-propriation amendment was costing about $50 million; there were 100 mil-lion taxpayers; so each taxpayer was having a cost imposed on them of about 50 cents. As best I could figure, the average beneficiary was getting about $700. Members don't have to have a degree in mathematics or any fundamental understanding of economics to under-stand that if you have 100 million peo-ple all losing 50 cents each, and then you have beneficiaries who are getting, on average, $700 each, it doesn't take a lot of imagination to understand why in 1980 we were losing on every spend-ing amendment. The reason being, the average taxpayer could benefit only by 50 cents if the amendment were de-feated. That wasn't enough to activate them to write a letter in opposition. The average beneficiary was getting about $700, as best I could figure, on these votes on amendments. For $700 they were willing to do quite a bit, es-pecially through groups that rep-resented them where they would have thousands of members, sometimes tens of thousands of members, who were getting $700 each. So it very quickly became evident to me that we were fighting a losing bat-tle on spending. That ultimately gave rise to our efforts to try to elevate this to a national issue where, rather than voting on all these little amendments that cost taxpayers 50 cents each, we could turn it into a big issue where we were talking fundamentally about the future of America, which is what budg-ets are about. And, in fact, in 1981 when Ronald Reagan became President, we were able to adopt a budget that dra-matically reduced the growth in gov-ernment spending, that reformed enti-tlements, and that cut taxes across- the-board by 25 percent. And I would argue, probably more than anything else, that and Ronald Reagan's opposi-tion to regulations and the rolling back of burdensome regulations, and the monetary policy of the Fed, ex-plained why we are in the happy condi-tion we are in today with the current state of the economy. But what I discovered in 1981 was the only way you can win on these issues is when you are debating the big issue in-stead of the individual spending pro-gram. The budget has become our way of trying to rein in spending. One of the vehicles we have in that budget process is spending caps, where we de-bate how much money we are going to spend on discretionary programs and we set it in law and then we judge spending based on that number that we have in fact set into law. In order to try to beef up our strength to try to hold the line on spending, we estab-lished budget points of order. In order to try to enforce them we established supermajority budget points of order, with 60 votes required in order to vio-late the budget. I will, later today, raise a budget point of order against this appropria-tion bill. Why do I object to this appro-priation? First of all, you cannot spend $14 billion beyond the spending caps in actual cash outlays, without doing a lot of things that almost everybody is going to be in favor of. But here is the basic problem. We set out, in 1990, in a budget agreement, a little loophole. I would have to say I was worried about it when it happened. But the loophole was allowing the President and Con-gress to get together and declare emer-gency spending, to designate spending as an emergency and therefore get around the binding constraints on spending that we had written into the budget. That provision went into effect in 1990. And in 1991 we declared $900 million of emergency spending. But in 1992, with the Presidential election, with the election of Bill Clinton, and with the fundamental change that oc-curred since then, here is what has happened to spending that we have an-nually designated as an emergency, and therefore outside the budget caps, and outside any binding constraint that we all solemnly voted for as part of the budget process. In fact, the spending levels that I will be trying to defend today with my point of order were adopted 98 to 2 on June 27 of 1997. Only two Members of the Senate voted against making the commitment to hold the line on spending. I am today going to be offering a point of order to try to hold the line on that commit-ment we made. But here is what happened. Begin- ning in 1991 we had $900 million des-ignated as an emergency in a govern-ment that was spending, in 1991, maybe $1.2 trillion. It was not very much money by comparison. In 1992, we de-clared $8.3 billion of spending to be such an emergency that it did not even count as part of the budget process; that it was exempt from the cap. By 1994 that number had grown to $12.2 bil-lion that, in 1994, we designated as an emergency. Because of our action at the end of last year in passing a $21 billion emer-gency funding bill, we have already violated the budget for fiscal year 1999 above the level that we committed to on June 27 of 1997. We have already vio-lated that budget by $15 billion in budget authority, which is the portion of the $21 billion that the President has already released by concurring in the emergency designation. If we adopt this bill unchanged, as it is written and now is before the Senate, we will de-clare another $14.8 billion in budget au-thority as emergency, which will mean that in 1999 alone, we will bust the spending cap by $29.8 billion, all of which will be designated as an emer-gency, and all of which will be exempt from our budgetary process. First of all, isn't it amazing that we have seen the level of emergency spending grow in 1991 from $0.9 billion, to $29.8 billion? What this really shows is we have lost control of the budget VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5654 May 20, 1999 process. This loophole is literally de- stroying our ability to control spend-ing. What are these items that are de- clared as emergencies, items that were so critical that we had to pass an emer-gency supplemental appropriation in order to fund them? Let me just give you some of the ones from last year that have already busted the budget by $15 billion. Then I will give you a few from this year. Army research into caffeinated chewing gum; the National Center for Complementary and grasshopper research; manure handling and disposal; onion research\u2014those are the kind of items that were included in the emergency measure that we passed last year that has caused us to violate this year's budget already by $15 billion. Let me go over some of the items that make up this supplemental appro-priation bill. ''National Public Radio, $48 million to purchase satellite capac-ity; $1.3 million for the World Trade Organization ministerial meeting in Seattle.'' Would anybody have us be-lieve that we planned that meeting and we suddenly discovered, after years of planning, that we had to pay for it? Would anybody believe that this should suddenly be contained in an emergency bill? No. But what they would believe is we always knew we had to pay for it but we did not put it in the budget, knowing we would put it in an emer-gency bill and therefore we could get around spending constraints. ''Filling up San Carlos Lake; the pur- chase of a post office and a Federal court house in Minnesota; moderniza-tion at Washington International Air-port.'' Modernizing an airport is God's work, but does it belong in an emer-gency bill? Don't we fund that out of a trust fund? What is it doing in an emergency supplemental bill? ''Ren-ovating the U.S. House page dor-mitory?'' I do not doubt that is meri-torious. If I did a survey among the pages they might think it is a wonder-ful idea. But is suddenly the world going to come to an end if we did it in this year's regular appropriation? My guess is we will not spend a penny of it until this year's appropriation bill is enacted anyway, so why is it in this emergency appropriation? It's in this emergency appropriation so we do not have to count it toward the spending caps next year. ''$1.5 million for the University of the District of Colum-bia.'' Then there is funding for the ma-jority whip's office\u2014that is in the House let me make clear\u2014and the House minority leader's office, $333,000 each. Why isn't that in the appropria-tion bill for the legislative branch of Government? Why are we not funding that through the normal budget proc-ess? The answer again is we put these things in emergency funding measures in order, basically, to take them out of the process. Why does it matter? Why does it matter that we are getting ready to bust our spending caps by $29.8 billion? Why it matters is that every penny of that money is coming out of Social Se-curity. We do not have a surplus today except for the fact that Social Security is collecting more money than it is paying out. In fact, Social Security is collecting $127 billion this year more than it will spend. We have already spent $16 billion of that on something other than Social Security. We are get-ting ready to spend another $14.8 bil-lion from this bill on something other than Social Security. The point is, if we had not passed the emergency supplemental bill last year, which ended up taking $17 billion away from Social Security in this year, we would have had in this year the first time ever in American history where we actually had a Social Security sur-plus available to either lock up in a lockbox so it could not be spent or use it to save Social Security. We do not have that ability now be- cause of the emergency bill we passed last year, and now we are passing an-other bill that will take $14.8 billion. The point I am making is this: We cannot have it both ways. We cannot say we want to lock this money up for Social Security and spend it at the same time. You can say you want to spend it and that this spending is crit-ical and that it is absolutely essential we fill up these lakes and build these dormitories and that we fund repara-tion payments to Japanese South Americans from World War II, that we repair high schools, which I never knew was a function of the Federal Govern-ment. You can say those are emergencies and they are important enough that we are willing to plunder Social Security in order to fund them. That is a legiti-mate position. It is not one with which I agree, but it is a legitimate position. What you cannot do is say we are going to lock this money away from Social Security or we are going to use it to save Social Security and then turn around and spend it. It is not legiti-mate to do both. What we are trying to do in this Congress is say we want to save the money for Social Security and we are trying to spend it at the same time. I do not hold myself out as being more righteous than anybody else, but that is turning a little more sharply than I can turn. I still remember the press conferences where we stood up and said we want to lock this money away. Here we are today spending it. What am I trying to do in my point of order and what will it do? First of all, there is not a point of order under the budget resolution against defense spending. There is a point of order against nondefense spending. The trag-edy of this bill is that we could have offset all the nondefense spending in this bill. There was a point at which, before we started piling on more and more spending, we could have, with $441 million, offset all of the non-defense spending in this bill, in which case we would not have had an emer-gency designation to allow us to spend beyond the budget. A decision was made by the Appro- priations Committee not to do that. They could have done it. The level of reductions in other programs would have been minuscule. But the basic re-sponse from the Appropriations Com-mittee, with all due respect, has been: We are not going to pay for these pro-grams, we are not going to offset them and, basically, if you don't like it, do something about it. That has basically been the message, and people have been up front and hon-est about it. The only thing I know to do about it is to oppose the bill and to use the budget which we adopted and of which I am proud\u2014it is the best budget that has been written since I have been in Congress or certainly the best budg-et since the Reagan budget. The problem is, I do not see any will- ingness on the part of our colleagues to enforce the budget. It is as if somehow writing a good budget was enough. Every day I read in the paper, often from members of the Appropriations Committee, that they do not have any intention of living within these num-bers. Some people are saying: OK, let this $14.8 billion go and then the next time we will resist. If you are going to resist this never-ending spending spree and this plundering of the Social Security trust fund, you have to begin to resist. We are averaging over $10 billion a year of spending we are not even count-ing as part of the budget, and I believe that has to end. I am going to make a point of order which simply makes the point that under the budget we wrote earlier this year, any Member of the Senate can raise a budget point of order identi-fying emergency designations in non-defense areas that are not offset, and that in order to overcome that point of order, those who want to spend that money, those who want to take that money out of Social Security, will have to get 60 votes to waive that point of order. I do not deceive myself into thinking we are going to get enough votes to sustain this point of order. I realize how the system works. But I think it is important that we begin to raise ques-tions about what is going on in the Senate. I do not know how we are going to save Social Security if we keep spending the Social Security sur-plus, nor do I see how we are ever going to give tax relief if we\u2014\u2014 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator's 20 minutes have expired. Mr. GRAMM. I ask unanimous con- sent that I may take 7 12minutes off my 15 minutes on the point of order I will raise and use that 7 12minutes now. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I have great prob-lems now. I understand the Senator wants to vote on this point of order, VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5655 May 20, 1999 and there are 30 minutes on that. We then have time left for the debate on the bill itself. This vote then, I take it, will occur sometime around 25 after 2, the way I look at it. I put the Senate on notice that I am going to ask that the Senate stand in recess or stand off this bill from the hour of 3:30 p.m. until 4:15 p.m. I have not done it yet, but I want everyone to know we have to go off this bill. Our committee cannot be on the floor during that period of time because of a very important meeting the committee has that we cannot can-cel. Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield? Mr. STEVENS. Yes. Mr. GRAMM. I will be very happy to have this vote on waiving the point of order at any point that will conven-ience the Senator. There is nothing magic about doing it now. I had thought at the end of this 7 12minutes that I would raise the point of order, we could go ahead and have this vote and dispose of it, and therefore there will be no trouble being off the bill or potentially finishing the bill before the meeting. If the Senator wants to delay it, I will be happy to do that. The time is not of any importance to me. What-ever will convenience the Senator. Mr. STEVENS. That is 1 hour 6 min- utes beyond that. I serve notice to the Senate, as manager, I cannot be here between the hour of 3:30 p.m. and 4:15 p.m. We will go ahead and have the vote when Senator G RAMM 's time ex- pires, but then I will ask the leader to give us consent to do something in that period of time so we can keep our meeting as scheduled. The Senator has another 7 12minutes now, as I under- stand. Mr. GRAMM. On this. Why don't I go ahead and raise the point of order and take my 15 minutes and explain it, if that is OK with the chairman. Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, what has the Senator been doing? I thought we gave him 20 minutes so he can do that. Mr. GRAMM. The Senator gave me 20 minutes to speak against the bill. I have done that. I am ready to raise the point of order. Mr. DOMENICI. And speak 15 more minutes? Mr. GRAMM. I have a right to under the unanimous consent request. Mr. DOMENICI. I misunderstood when I quickly gave the Senator 20 minutes. Mr. GRAMM. If the Senator wants me to yield the floor so he can speak now\u2014\u2014 Mr. DOMENICI. No. Mr. STEVENS. There are 30 minutes on his motion to waive. Mr. GRAMM. I get half the time on the motion to waive since I am against waiving. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the conference report contains nondefense emergency designations in violation of section 206 of House Con-current Resolution 68. I send a list of those designations to the desk. There are 29 nondefense emergency designa- tions in this bill that are in violation and that are subject to a point of order, and I raise the point of order against each of these 29 designations. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from New Mexico. Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, pursu- ant to section 206 of H. Con. Res. 68 and section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act, I move to waive all points of order against this conference report. The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 30 minutes equally divided. Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Texas. Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me be sure to clarify: There are 29 provi-sions in the bill that are subject to a point of order because they are not funded. Let me explain to my colleagues what this point of order does and what it does not do. This point of order does not kill the emergency supplemental appropria-tions bill. This point of order does not strike any funding measure in the emergency supplemental appropria-tions bill. What this point of order does, by striking the emergency des-ignation for these 29 unfunded, non-defense provisions, is that it will trig-ger an across-the-board cut in all non-defense programs to fund these items. That across-the-board cut will fund $3.4 billion of unfunded programs. It will do it, according to the Office of Management and Budget, with a 1.25- percent across-the-board cut in discre-tionary nondefense programs. Obviously, our bill\u2014if this point of order is sustained\u2014will differ from the House bill. Under the procedures of our budget the bill would go back to the House, which could adopt the bill with this point of order made and therefore require the across-the-board cuts to offset this new spending, or the House could amend the bill to throw out the point of order, and the bill would come back and we would vote on the bill again and see if we could sustain it. So that is basically what we are doing. This point of order does not kill the supplemental appropriation, it simply pays for it. It simply says, in the $3.4 billion of programs that are not fund-ed, that under the Budget Act you can make a point of order that they are not funded, and insist on that point of order so that 60 Members of the Senate would have to vote to say we do not want to fund these programs, we want to bust the budget, and we are willing to take the money out of the Social Se-curity surplus in order to pay for it\u2014 which is what you will be saying if you vote to waive this Budget Act point of order. Have no doubt about that. If we sustain this point of order, there will be a 1.25-percent across-the- board cut in the same accounts, same section of the budget, nondefense dis-cretionary, to fund these programs. The Appropriations Committee will have a decision at that point as to whether they really want these pro-grams if they have to fund them. My guess is for many of them, they will not. My guess is, if you have to fund these programs, you will decide you do not really want them all. Why have I made this point of order? And why is it important? Why it is im-portant is that our budget is so dif-ferent from real budgets in the real world. Every time we want to bust our budget, we say we have an emergency. But American families have emer-gencies every day. They are not able to bust their budgets. What we basically do here would be equivalent to a fam- ily\u2014they have written out their budg-et, and they decide to buy a new refrig-erator this year or they are going to go on vacation this year or they are going to buy a new car this year; and Johnny falls down the steps, breaks his arm. The way the Government does it, they say: Well, that is an emergency, so we are going to waive our budget. We just won't have to count that as part of what we are spending. But that is not the way families work. Families have to sit back down around their kitchen table, get out an envelope and a pencil, and they have to figure out that if they have spent $400 setting Johnny's arm, they are not going to be able to buy that refrigerator or they are not going to be able to go on that vacation. They do not like it, but that is what they have to do, because that is the real world. All I am asking here is that on these $3.4 billion worth of programs, if they are so good and they are so important, let's pay for them. It is not as if we are going to do great violence to the budg-et of the United States if we are re-quired to pay for it. We are talking about a 1.25-percent across the board reduction in order to pay for these pro-grams. My view is that if you really wanted these programs, you would be willing to pay for them. If you are not willing to pay for them, we ought not to be spending it. So I want to reserve the remainder of my time and conclude by just saying this. If you meant it when you set those caps on spending, if you meant it when you said you want to lock away this money for Social Security or use it for Social Security reform, we have an opportunity today to save $3.4 bil-lion that belongs to Social Security. It does not belong to general government. It does not belong to all of these projects we are funding here. It belongs to Social Security. If you want to save that $3.4 billion for Social Security, if you want to lock it away or use it to save Social Secu-rity, vote to sustain this point of order. I hope my colleagues will vote to sus-tain this point of order, because I think it is important. I think if we do not stand up now, we will now be at $29.8 billion by which we have overspent the 1999 budget before we have ever passed a single regular appropriations bill\u2014all in the name of emergencies. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5656 May 20, 1999 So if we are ever going to stand up and stop this plundering of Social Se-curity and stop this runaway spending train, we have to do it now. I urge my colleagues to vote with me if you want to protect Social Security and if you want to live up to the budget. I reserve the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. V OINOVICH ). The Senator from Alaska. Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for just 2 minutes on this motion to waive. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for making that motion to waive. My point in addressing the Senate now is to inform the Senators that, ba-sically, this point of order deals with the moneys that are in the bill for PL- 480 food aid, for refugee assistance, for farm aid, aid for the Wye River, aid to Jordan, for the Central America and Caribbean emergency due to Hurricane Keith, and for the FEMA disasters that have taken place throughout our coun-try. All of those are matters that could not have been contemplated in 1947. We controlled $1.8 trillion on a 2-year pe-riod. And the Senator from Texas is ob-jecting to the fact that these events, that have taken place totally unex-pectedly, are going to cost $29.6 billion. He is talking about 16 one-hun- dredths of 1 percent of the total spend-ing that we control. In other words, es-timates that were made have been ex-ceeded now because of unforeseen cir-cumstances in Central America, in farm aid, in terms of the assistance to Jordan, in terms of FEMA disasters, and national disasters declared by the President, and have consumed 16 one- hundredths of 1 percent more money than we estimated. He is wrong in talking about the bill for the year 2000. We have not gotten to the year 2000. This does not have any impact on the year 2000 except in terms of defense. It aids us in defense trying to deal with defense matters. These are things that the Budget Act rightfully said there is a time when you can have emergencies, when they are unexpected items that have hap-pened. There are a lot of things in this bill that are not emergencies; they are sup-plemental; they are supplemental items. We can argue about them, but they are not involved in what the Sen-ator from Texas is doing. An opinion about lumping all those things in the bill is one thing, but to deal with this concept of knocking out the emergency clause is wrong. I hope the Senators will support the motion of the Senator from New Mexico. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from New Mexico. Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, not too long ago Senator G RAMM and I stood on the floor shoulder to shoulder preparing a budget for the United States. Not too long ago, I came up with the idea of a lockbox for Social Security. Once my friend, Senator G RAMM , saw it, a few words of con-gratulations and a few thoughts on how to make it perhaps a little better, we stood shoulder to shoulder that we wanted to save the Social Security trust fund. Nothing has changed. Noth-ing has changed. The Senator from New Mexico is proud of the budget that is going to op-erate for the year 2000, the new millen-nium. It is going to be a tough budget, and we are going to try to live with it. But I do not believe we should leave the floor today with a lot of Ameri-cans, if they were listening, thinking that the budget of the United States is out of control. Sometimes my good friend from Texas overstates the case. And by over-stating the case, sometimes, instead of being as effective as he could be, he is a little less effective. Nobody looking at the budget of the United States as it pertains to the ac-counts we are talking about, defense and appropriated domestic accounts, thinks it is out of control. As a matter of fact, the whole world looks at this budget, the one that the Senator from Texas is saying is out of control, and says, how do you do it? You are doing so well. As a matter of fact, the defense spending which is in this budget\u2014part of the budget that the Senator is talk-ing about\u2014is at the lowest level and under control, the lowest level since World War II, the end of World War II, in terms of the percent of our gross do-mestic product that goes to defense. Likewise, the domestic spending that he is alluding to, out of control, says he, well, let me tell you, it is the low-est in history in terms of the percent of GDP. We are doing a great job of con-trolling this part of the budget. He and I may come to the floor and discuss another issue where we might agree, but it has nothing to do with this bill, nothing to do with these ideas that he is alluding to today about the budget. They have to do with entitle-ments and mandatory spending. So for those who think the budget has gotten kind of big, we have to face up to where it is that it is getting its pot belly. It is not getting it from these two ac-counts, defense and domestic discre-tionary spending. That is the truth. The Senator referred to families and their budgets. I noticed some people were listening to him almost enraptured thinking about their own checkbooks. To compare a family checkbook with a great American country that has a war going on in Kosovo that we didn't know about 6 months ago and expect us not to have to spend some money for that is to compare an individual American fam-ily in their kitchen with their check-book to a country that is at war and needs money to fight the war. That is what is principally behind this appro-priations bill. The overwhelming per-centage of this spending is for the de-fense of our Nation, if that is why we are in Kosovo, because we have some-thing to defend. And whether you like the war or you don't like the war, it costs money. It isn't predicted in the family checkbook that in the middle of the month you are going to have a war, because families don't have wars. They don't go out and buy more tanks and more airplanes, when they have a dis-aster. That is point No. 1\u2014the budget is not out of control. Point No. 2\u2014the overwhelming per- centage of this particular bill is for the defense of our Nation. Many of us are proud that we put more money in than the President had asked us for. We thought the President low-balled the request because he didn't want to be embarrassed about this war, and so he has far too little money. We put in $5 billion more in this bill. Take that to the American people and ask them: Would you do that, or would you not do that? Would you believe Senator G RAMM 's reasoning for saying let's cut some other American programs to pay for that? By the way, the sequester which he is speaking about, the across-the-board cut which will be done by the Office of Management and Budget, the Presi-dent's people, it will not be 1.25 percent for all the rest of the accounts. Be-cause the year is so far down, it will be almost 4 percent, 3.75 percent, or some $3 billion. Is that what we should do when we have emergencies, cut all of Government across the board 3.75 per-cent, not when the budget starts, but when the budget year is half over with or more than half over with, just say we are going to cut it? Families do not do that either, if you want to talk about families. They don't come along when they have all their children's bills paid for and everything else and say that we are going to cut 3.75 per-cent out of it and spend it for some-thing else. They don't have that kind of problem. That is what we are going to be confronted with for American programs in education, in construc-tion, in highways, in everything. It is just not worth it, in this Sen- ator's opinion. The longer you wait and delay this bill, the more the demands are going to be, not less. They will be more. Let me just give you one more. If we are out of control, every country in Eu-rope and every industrial democracy in the world has already gone out of this world. They are all spending more than we are as a percentage of their budgets. Their budgets are much higher than ours. And that is why we are doing so well\u2014because our budgets are low, and our taxes must remain low. To be sure on my comments about how low defense spending is and how low domestic spending is versus other years and other nations, I have that on two pieces of paper. I ask that those two documents be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the mate- rial was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: VerDate Mar 15 2010 S5657 May 20, 1999 Total government\u2014Federal, State, local\u2014 spending as a percentage of GDP (1998) Percent United States ..................................... 31 England ............................................. 40 France ............................................... 54 Germany ............................................ 47 Japan ................................................. 37 Canada ............................................... 42 Percentage of GDP Defense Nondefense 1980 .................................................................. 5.0 5.2 1985 .................................................................. 6.2 4.0 1990 .................................................................. 5.3 3.5 1995 .................................................................. 3.8 3.8 1998 1................................................................ 3.2 3.4 1The lowest percentage since WWII, both defense and nondefense. Mr. DOMENICI. The issue now is not whether you want to vote for this bill or not. The issue is whether you want to support a motion to waive the point of order, a very specific, new point of order; I helped draft it. It is a nice point of order. Whether you want to waive it or not, that is the issue. If you want to vote against the bill, you can still do that but, frankly, you should move to waive this so that when those people who want to vote for this bill vote for it, they are not confronted with having to cut Government 3.75 percent in order to accomplish the pur-poses suggested here by my good friend from Texas, Senator G RAMM . How much time do I have remaining? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six min- utes 4 seconds. Mr. DOMENICI. I will yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Texas. Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend from New Mexico for helping me see that in an effort to derail this point of order that we didn't do something that could un-dercut the whole budget. I am very grateful for his help on that. I want to disagree with the points that have been made by my two col-leagues and do it in such a way as to not be disagreeable. First of all, our dear colleague, the chairman of the Appropriations Com-mittee, says that the violating expend-itures here that are not offset are only sixteen-hundredths of a percent of overall Government spending. Well, my point is, if it is that small an amount of money, why don't we pay for it? In a budget of $1.7 trillion, we are in es-sence saying that $3.4 billion of non-defense spending is so important we are willing to violate the budget in terms of spending beyond our cap. But it is not important enough that we are will-ing to cut somewhere else to fund it? It seems to me if it is that important, we ought to be willing to pay for it. As to whether the budget is out of control relative to much of the world, our budget is not out of control. I agree with our colleagues. I am not making a statement trying to send the stock market down at 2, nor do I think any statement I could make would be capa-ble of doing that. But I am not com-paring America to Honduras. I am not comparing America to Japan. I am comparing what America is doing rel-ative to what Congress promised the American people we would do. I do say that when we are spending, in emergency spending in 1999, three times as much as we have ever spent before, that suggests to me that some-thing is out of control. As we all know, we read every day in the paper where Members are saying there is no way we can live up to these spending caps, and that this is only the beginning of our violation of the budget. My view is this ought to be the beginning of the fight to preserve the budget numbers we adopted. Let me tell you how the budget is out of control. It is not out of control the way we keep our books, even though we are beginning to lose control by des-ignating all the spending as an emer-gency. But if we used accrual account- ing, like American business has to, with Medicare and Social Security, we would be running huge deficits today. I agree with our colleague from New Mexico. Many of our worst problems are in areas like Social Security and Medicare. But the point is, we have to have Presidential leadership, we have to put together a program to deal with those problems; and it takes a con-certed effort to do that. But the one area that we can control by ourselves is discretionary spending. The point is, if we don't have the will to prevent $3.4 billion of new spending, how are we going to have the will to reform Social Security or Medicare? In terms of comparing the checkbook of a family to a great nation and a great economy, I think it is a good comparison. In fact, Adam Smith once observed: What is wisdom in every household can hardly be folly in the economy of a great na-tion. Where can we find a better blueprint for fiscal responsibility than looking at working American families sitting around the kitchen table? The fact that they are dealing with thousands of dollars and we are dealing with billions of dollars doesn't fundamentally change things. They have to set prior-ities. They have to say no. And they have to say no to their children, the people they love, and to real needs. All I am saying is that we need to say no more often so that working families can say yes more often. I want to save Social Security so we don't have to double the payroll tax. I want to save Social Security so we don't have to cut benefits for the elderly. But we can't do that if we keep spending the Social Security surplus. In terms of across-the-board cuts, if it is not worth cutting to pay for, then why is it worth spending? If it is not worth taking it from a lower priority, is Social Security the lowest priority? Is taking this money out of the Social Security surplus of lower significance than funding all the thousands of other programs we fund? I don't think so. The final point. This is a point of order under the Budget Act against the nondefense portions of this bill. I would have raised a point of order against all the emergency designations in the bill had the point of order existed. I don't want people to think this is somehow nondefense versus defense. I believe in a strong defense. My dad was a ser-geant in the Army for 28 years 7 months and 27 days. I have voted for defense. I have helped write budgets that rebuilt defense. But I want to pay for defense. I think where the difference is, I am willing to cut other programs to fund defense. But I don't understand why we are not willing to take it away from something else to fund defense but we are willing to violate our spending caps to fund defense. And if this war is so vi-tally important\u2014let me make it clear that I don't see the vital national in-terest here. I don't see this as a vote on the war. But let me make it very clear, if this war is so vital, we ought to be willing to cut other Government pro-grams to fund it. The idea that we ought to take the money out of Social Security to fund this war, I think, is wrong. So, again, this is a hard issue. I don't doubt the sincerity of our colleagues who are trying to do a difficult job in writing these appropriations. But there are two reasons I am here making this point of order. No. 1, we busted the budget by $21 billion on the last day of the last Congress. We are already at al-most $30 billion of busting it now. We have to stop this from happening at some point. Let's do it now. Mr. STEVENS. I ask that the Sen- ator yield me 2 minutes. Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 2 minutes to the chairman. Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, let's go back to what we are talking about. If a family had a $16,000-a-year income and had a 16 one-hundredths of 1 per-cent overage in their expenditures that year, they would have to borrow $20. We are talking about 16 one-hun-dredths of 1 percent in excess of the budget. And it is for items that are emergencies. What family would not borrow $20 to meet an emergency? Is it disaster relief emergency? Yes. Is the Central America-Caribbean expendi-ture an emergency? Yes. The Wye River accord for Jordan, was that an emergency? Yes. Is farm country in trouble? Is that an emergency? Yes. All we are saying is we are going to deal with that $20 out of $16,000. That is the comparison for an average family. Mr. President, the thing that bothers me most about this is, we have to con-template change. I will make one statement to you. If the New Madrid Fault that runs through the center of this country suffers an earthquake again\u2014the last time it went off, the church bells rang in Boston because of an earthquake that took place going through the area west of the Mis-sissippi. It changed the Mississippi River. It went backwards. It started a new channel which it has today. Can you imagine the amount of money we VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, SENATE S5658 May 20, 1999 would have to have? That is why the Budget Act provides money for emer-gencies. If the Senator is trying to say you have to have 60 votes to overcome that, now, that is wrong. I hope we have them today, Mr. President. This is an emergency, and this money is needed by the Department of Defense, and the agencies need it. Thank you very much. Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senator from Texas have any time remaining? Mr. GRAMM. I don't think I have any. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator's time is up. Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in conclusion, Senator G RAMM makes a lot of good points. I believe we make some good points, also. I don't believe we ought to, at this stage of the budget year, adopt a point of order that will send us back to all of the Government programs, some of which many of us don't like, some of which many of us love, most of which are halfway through a year. I don't believe we ought to go back and have them cut 3.7 percent across the board. One thing about missing our budget targets\u2014the so-called caps, Mr. Presi-dent\u2014the overwhelming percentage of supplemental appropriations have been for real emergencies, or emergencies that the President of the United States asked us for and in which we con-curred. That is what the Budget Act says; caps are binding except for emer-gencies; emergency money is not sub-ject to caps. That is what we have here. I hope we pass this appropriations bill today and fund what our military desperately needs to replenish the Kosovo war and replenish the military equipment and the time that was spent in Central America for the disaster that killed 10,000 of our neighbors in Central America. Those are predomi-nant items in this bill. There are a lot of small ones that are difficult to jus-tify, but in a real sense they don't real-ly amount to the essence of this bill, which is emergencies we cannot con-template. I yield back whatever time I have. Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to offer my support to Senator G RAMM 's point of order against the supplemental appropriations conference report. As I have said before, we must provide the offsets for the nonemergency portions of this conference report. There is cur-rently $13.3 billion of nonemergency spending that has not been offset, in violation of the Budget Act. I believe that Congress must protect the Social Security surplus and ensure that the money is there for future generations, not spend it on items that are clearly nonemergency items. We have been spending the last few years talking about fiscal discipline and the spending caps. Now that we have a surplus, Congress must resist the temptation to circumvent the reg-ular appropriations process. Many of the items contained in the report should have been considered by the ap-propriations subcommittees and de- bated on the floor of the Senate. Con-gress must allow the regular process to take place and not sneak things into appropriations bills. I tried to offer legislation that would provide those offsets, but an objection was raised. I want to ensure that Con-gress does the right thing and pre-serves the Social Security surplus. This is what the lock box legislation would prevent. This is what my legisla-tion would prevent. I ask my col-leagues not to waive the Budget Act. Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I sup- ported Senator G RAMM 's point of order because, while some of the spending programs in this bill may have merit, they should not be funded by Social Se-curity Trust Fund balances. The point of order would not prevent these pro-grams from being funded, but would force Congress to find adequate offset-ting spending cuts to pay for those pro-grams, or those spending cuts would be imposed automatically at the end of the fiscal year. Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion to waive. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered. Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote take place at 15 minutes after 2, in 7 min-utes, and I yield that time until the vote to the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. S PECTER . The vote will take place at 2:15, in 7 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The vote will be at 2:15. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized. Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, the chairman of the Appropriations Com-mittee, for yielding me the time. I support the waiver on the point of order. The conference committee la-bored extensively and diligently to come up with the bill that is on the floor at the present time. It was a tough, contentious, argumentative conference. While not perfect, we con-ferees did the very best we could. At some points on Wednesday night of last week, it looked a little like ''Saturday Night Live,'' except it was Wednesday. C-SPAN was in the conference room re-cording and videocasting across the country to the few who might have been inclined to watch. Having been a party to that con- ference and having struggled through the issues of the necessity for military spending and the emergency programs that are involved in Hurricane Mitch and the tragedies in Oklahoma and Kansas\u2014Kansas being my native State \u2014the conference committee did the very best it could. This bill ought to be enacted in toto. Since that requires a waiver initially, that ought to be undertaken. We are really looking at broader, complex issues as we face the appro-priations process for fiscal year 2000. We have recently seen the allocations in the House of Representatives. The allocations in the Senate are por-tending for very, very severe cuts. I chair the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services. The Presi-dent's budget is slightly in excess of $90 billion. The allocation preliminarily marked up for my subcommittee is $80 billion. If that is to happen, we are going to have some really drastic, dras-tic cuts, cuts which the American peo-ple are going to have to evaluate as they are making their wishes known in our representative democracy to the Members of the House and Senate. We have budget caps. I would like to live within those budget caps. But to do that, we are going to be looking at these kinds of reductions in spending: On Safe and Drug-Free Schools, there would be a cut of $66 million from the Drug and Violence Prevention Pro-gram. Here we are today on a juvenile crime bill where we are trying to deal with the problems of juvenile crime, and at the same time we are looking at a budget which is going to cut funding of $66 million from the guts of that kind of a program\u2014drug and violence prevention. We are looking at cuts on the Job Corps of $150 million from a $1.3 billion program. When we talk about the Job Corps, here again we are talking about deal-ing with juveniles who may have gone astray. If you have a juvenile offender with- out a trade or a skill, a functional illit-erate who leaves prison, that indi-vidual is going to go back to a life of crime, and is going to get the first gun he can put his hands on. And here we are talking about an enormous cut in the JOBS Program, which is designed specifically against that problem. We have enormous cuts in child care\u2014$131 million in our efforts to whip the welfare program and send wel-fare mothers to work. Child care is in-dispensable. Special education\u2014a favorite of all Senators\u2014would be cut by $480 million. The National Institutes of Health, the crown jewel of the Federal Govern-ment, perhaps the only jewel of the Federal Government\u2014instead of having a $2 billion increase, which the Senate said we ought to have in the sense of the Senate, the National Institutes of Health would be reduced by $1.8 billion, which would result in approximately 6000 fewer grants at a time when med-ical research is on the verge of solving enormous problems of Parkinson's with the new stem cells estimated within the 5- to 10-year range. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ate will be in order. Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. Some of those who were called to order may be the ones who ought to be lis-tening to what needs to happen in our appropriations process if we are to achieve the goals of our lofty rhetoric. But interrupting, the juvenile vio- lence bill on the culture of violence- VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov \u2014 SENATE S5659 May 20, 1999 we have programs which are designed to deal with that. The way we are heading, we are going to be cutting the heart out of the precise programs in-tended to deal with that culture of vio-lence. These are issues which I hope the American people will understand so that their views may be felt in our rep-resentative democracy. We would all like to stay within the caps. We would all like to economize. But when we take a look at a $10 bil-lion cut which hits labor, safety pro-grams, and health and education, those are matters which have to be decided by this body reflecting the views of our constituency. I again thank the chairman for yield- ing the time. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote. Mr. BYRD. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Alaska. Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if we could, for the orderly presentation of the balance of the argument on this bill, I inquire, how much time remains on each side? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Alaska has 12 minutes. The Senator from West Virginia has 42 min-utes. The Senator from North Dakota has 15 minutes. Mr. STEVENS. I ask the Senator from West Virginia if we can make a list of who is going to be recognized, because almost all the time is allo-cated, as I understand it. I yield 5 min-utes of my time to the Senator from Virginia, Mr. W ARNER . I reserve 7 min- utes of the time. Can the Senator allo-cate his time? Mr. BYRD. Yes. Let me see how much time I have left. I have 45 min-utes promised. Mr. STEVENS. The Senator has 42 minutes, but I will give him 3 of my minutes. Mr. BYRD. All right. Mr. STEVENS. Please tell us what they are. Mr. BYRD. Senator C ONRAD , 5 min- utes; 8 GRAHAM , Senator 5 minutes; D minutes; ator B OXER , 5 minutes. Mr. STEVENS. Is the Senator reserv- ing some time for himself? Mr. BYRD. Senator D ORGAN has 15 minutes for himself outside this. Mr. STEVENS. Does that allocate fully the Senator's 42 minutes? The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ENZI). It does. Mr. STEVENS. I urge the Senators to take their time starting now. Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North Dakota. Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as I begin, I pay tribute to the Senator from Alaska, the chairman of the Ap-propriations Committee, Mr. S TEVENS , and the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. B YRD, and other of my colleagues. I see the Senator from Mississippi on the floor, Mr. C OCHRAN , and so many others who in that conference spent hour after hour, day after day ham-mering out a conference agreement. Especially the chairman and the rank-ing member. I recall one evening sit-ting there at 1 in the morning, and they were still there exhibiting the kind of patience that is quite extraor-dinary in order to resolve all of these many issues. Much of the discussion was about the victims of Hurricane Mitch, the respon-sibility to respond to our neighbors in this hemisphere who have been hit with such a terrible disaster, the mili-tary needs with respect to the air-strikes in Kosovo, and the prosecution of that conflict, the needs for spring planting loans in farm country, and a range of other issues. I support many of those areas, but I am not going to support the conference report because I believe, as I indicated in the conference committee, that if there are resources above that which was requested for the Defense Depart-ment for the prosecution of this con- flict in Kosovo, if there were $2 billion or $3 billion or $5 billion or $6 billion more available, then I believe we should have a better debate on the pri-orities of the use of those funds. I, for one, believe we have an urgent, urgent need in rural America to provide a bet-ter safety net to give family farmers a chance to make it through this price depression. I believe that is the pri-ority. We had a vote in the conference on the Senate side, and we lost 14-14 on a proposal that would have added nearly $5.5 billion for some price supports to build a bridge across those price val-leys during these troubled times in rural America. We lost 14-14. I wish we had won. Nearly $5.5 billion to $6 billion was added to this package for defense spending that was not requested. It is not that the money is not available, it is that a different priority was at-tached to the spending of this money. I will tell you why I feel so strongly about this. I come from rural America. I come from a small town. We raised some cattle and horses. Last Thursday, my brother called a florist in a little town called Mott, ND. Mott, ND, is 14 miles from my hometown of Regent. Regent has 300 people and Mott is a bigger town and always was, even when I was growing up. Mott is about 800 people. My brother called the florist on the Main Street of Mott. There is one little florist shop. He said: My brother and I want to order flowers to be delivered to the cemetery at Regent for our mother and father for their graves on Memo-rial Day. We do that each year, and we also do so on Mother's Day and Fa-ther's Day. My brother said he told the woman who runs and owns the floral shop: By the way, I forgot to call you this year on Mother's Day. I was going to have you deliver some flowers for Mother's Day. Incidentally, this floral shop always apologizes when we call because she says: We have to charge you a $2 deliv-ery fee. It is 28 miles. My brother said: I forgot to call you this year to deliver flowers for our mother's grave on Mother's Day, but I would like you to deliver them on Me-morial Day. The woman who owns the flower shop said: That's all right, we delivered some on Mother's Day because we know you call every year and we thought you just forgot. Later on, we were going to send you a bill, and if you paid it, that was all right, and if you did not, that's all right, too. That probably does not happen across America, but it happens in my part of the country, in rural America, where family farmers and Main Street mer-chants work together in a lifestyle that is really quite wonderful. People do things, people help each other, but there is no amount of help in farm country these days that can reach out VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5660 May 20, 1999 and say to family farmers who are struggling to make a living: We will help you with the price of your grain. We know you are trucking that grain to the elevator these days and are told there is no value; we will help you. That is not what is happening. In fact, they are going to the elevators today to find out the grain market has collapsed and they are getting Depres-sion-era prices, at the same time the current farm program, freedom to farm, is pulling the rug out from under these farmers with respect to the safe-ty net. We need to help. If we want family farmers in our fu- ture, we need to help. If we want to preserve this kind of lifestyle, yes, of family farms and Main Street of our small towns, we need to do something to help. I want to read a few things from Ted Koppel's program ''Nightline'' on Tues-day, May 18. They did a program on the farm crisis. They pointed out\u2014while all of the good news comes to the Washington Post and the New York Times, just open them up and read all the wonderful news, our economy is growing, unemployment is down, infla-tion is down, virtually everything else is up, a lot of good news\u2014but the farm belt does not experience that good news. Family farmers are in desperate trouble and small towns are shrinking. The rural economy is in desperate trouble. Ted Koppel on his program had farm- ers and others talking. I will share some of that with my colleagues: Here's what many farmers see happening, the prices they can sell their crops for falling and predicted to stay low .... wheat prices are down 42 percent. Now, ask yourself, how would you feel or your family feel if you had a 42- percent cut in your income? Would you feel that the economy is doing real well? Corn prices are down 38 percent. Oats and barley down 32 percent. In constant dollars, these are prices that we received in the family farm in the Great Depression. At the start of the program, Ted Koppel interviewed a fellow. He talks about a guy who works with farm fami-lies, tries to help them. Willard Brunell said: I think the scariest one was back a few years when I got a phone call from a farm wife [who] said my husband just left with a gun and he's driving away. He said he's going to his tractor. [He said] I was there with him 20 minutes and it was quite a ways away. I got him out of his tractor. He sat in my lit-tle car and we spent two hours in that car trying to talk him down and he told me ex-actly how he was doing, going to do it. He had the gun with him. . . . They get more than 50 calls a month in this fellow's church talking about that kind of desperation. In Minnesota and North Dakota, where Ted Koppel's program was taped, is some of the richest farmland in the entire world. Last year, one in every three farmers grew a crop that cost more to produce than they could sell it for. For many, it was the fourth, fifth year that happened. Lowell Nelson was interviewed on this program. He is one of those farm-ers. He was born, raised and had his own sons on this land, a fertile 400 acres he bought from his brothers 35 years ago after his dad died. But this spring [is the first spring] he's not planting anything. He cannot. He is ruined. He said: Well, I had been putting it off [this deci- sion] for quite [a long] time and I had gotten a lot of urging, you know, from my wife to make a decision and I had just been putting it off. It's a decision I didn't want to make. His wife said: One night he was out in the field and all of a sudden called me on the [shortwave] radio and wanted me to come over just to ride with him [on the tractor] and I knew some-thing was wrong and it was shortly there-after that he decided he'd better get some medical help. The interviewer asked Mr. Nelson: How badly did you scare yourself? He said: Real bad. The interviewer asked: What do you mean? He said: Thinking that it may be better off not being here. The reason I mention the ''Nightline'' program, they interviewed these folks. These are real people in desperate trouble\u2014just in desperate trouble. We have a country whose econ-omy is growing and thriving and ris-ing\u2014full of good news. The stock mar-ket hits record highs. Everybody says this is a terrific economy. Then you drive out down a country road, and talk to a family who has struggled for 20, 30, 50 years, and you see what is happening. A big guy stood up at a meeting I had one day. He had a big beard, a tall fel-low, a strong fellow. He said: You know, my granddad farmed my farm. My dad farmed it for 40 years. And I have farmed it for 23 years. Then his eyes teared up and his chin began to quiver, and he could not continue any-more. When he finally got the words out, he said: And I can't keep going anymore. I'm broke, so I have to sell the farm. That may not matter to some, but it matters to me. A woman wrote me a couple of weeks ago and said: We had our auction sale on our farm, and my 17-year-old son would not get out of bed to come down-stairs. He refused to come down and help at the auction sale because he was so heartbroken. He knew he would never be able to do what his dad did. He knew he would never be able to farm that farm. She could not get him out of bed he was so heartbroken. I tell you all of that because we pass a supplemental bill and we say: All right, on defense, the Defense Depart-ment needs $6.1 billion to prosecute this war in Kosovo. We must restore munitions and planes and do other things. And I am for all of that. I sup- port all of that. I support our men and women in uniform and support this mission. But then we also say there is another $5 or $6 billion we want to add to that. And I say, if there is $5 or $6 billion around that can be used in this discre-tionary way, then I want the priority to say: We want to continue to invest in America's family farmers. You think this country is going to be a better, stronger place when we don't have family farmers left? When cor-porations farm America from Cali-fornia to Maine, you think food prices are not going to go up? And it is more than just farming. These folks con-tribute in every way to their commu-nity. They contribute to a way of life that we are losing in this country. Yet, somehow, when we talk about all of these fancy economic theories, nobody talks about the family as an economic unit\u2014nobody. The economic unit in this country is the large corporation. They are all get-ting married, as you know. There is all this corporate romance going on all over America. Every day you wake up and see a new couple of corporations have decided to get hitched and get bigger. What about the economic unit that really matters in the center of this country in America's farm belt that grows America's food? That makes America's communities strong? That helps build America's churches? That puts life on main streets on Saturday night? What about those economic units? What about family farmers? Last year, we passed an emergency bill. About half of that money is not yet in the hands of family farmers. It will be there in a matter of weeks, I guess, through the USDA, through this formula. But it is $1.5 billion short of what was promised. We should have at least added that to this piece of legisla-tion. We should have at least added some additional support to say to fam-ily farmers, when prices collapse at De-pression-level prices, we are going to reach out a helping hand, extend a helping hand to you to say you matter to this country. We had an opportunity to do that and did not. A 14-to-14 vote, and how I re-gret losing that vote\u2014but in this busi-ness, in this system, you win some and you lose some. My hope is that those who felt it not appropriate, those who felt it was not the time to respond to this need now will, a week from now or a month from now, decide that it is time to respond. This is not Democrat and Repub- lican. We have had bad farm programs under all kinds of administrations\u2014 Democratic administrations, Repub-lican administrations. I want the farm-ers to get the price from the market-place as well. That would be my fer-vent hope. But when the marketplace collapses, we must help. Let me make a final point. I think it is fascinating that at a time when VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5661 May 20, 1999 somehow the economic unit of the fam- ily, with respect to agriculture, does not seem to matter, that which the family farm produces in this country is used by everybody else to make record profits\u2014the railroads make record profits hauling it; the cereal manufac-turers make record profits putting air in it and puffing it up and putting it on the grocery store shelves and calling it puffed wheat\u2014the farmers go broke. The manufacturers get rich. Or they sell a steer for a pittance or sell a hog for $20, an entire hog. You can buy a hog for $20 at the bottom of the hog market, and then go to the store and buy a ham that cost you $30 or $40. Buy a small ham at twice the price you bought the entire hog for. Something is fundamentally wrong, and farmers know it. So everybody who touches these products make record profits and are getting bigger and rich-er; and the folks who start the tractor and plow the ground and plant the seed, and then hope all summer it does not hail, the insects don't come, that it rains enough and doesn't rain too much, and that they, by the grace of God, might get a crop, wonder whether they will be able to sell it in the fall and make any kind of profit. So I cannot vote for this conference report. But having said that, I deeply admire the work of the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from West Vir-ginia and others who participated in it. The priorities, in my judgment, needed to include the priorities I have just dis-cussed with respect to helping family farmers, and they do not, regrettably. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. V OINOVICH ). The Senator from Virginia. Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this conference re-port. I say to my good friend from North Dakota, I had oriented myself to one set of remarks, but I listened care-fully to his, as I frequently do. He cer-tainly speaks from the heart about his people. I remember the floods that his State experienced years ago. I feel as if I am on the farm, the family farm, with him. And you talked about that family. So while we may be at odds on this bill, I want to take the same theme and talk about a family. I want to talk about a military family. This bill has in it provisions for a military family. I want to talk about that wife here in the United States, or in other places of the world, with their children, whose husband is flying an aircraft right at this minute in harm's way. It could be the reverse, because women are flying aircraft in harm's way in this conflict over the Balkan region, over Iraq. Mr. President, this country is at war. And for that wife at home, war is hell. For that individual in the cockpit, war is hell. The purpose of this emergency legis- lation is to provide the dollars nec-essary to alleviate to some extent the strain on the families and those in the cockpits. Every Member of the Senate has young men and women involved in the conflict in Kosovo or over the general Balkan region or over Iraq or standing guard, as they are, in other far, remote areas of the world to protect freedom. That is what this bill is all about. Let me add one other feature, and then I will yield the floor, because many are anxious to speak. Each year, the Department of De- fense plans for the next year and the year following as to how many avi-ators, for example, they will train to keep the cockpits filled. Last year, the number of pilots we had to keep to maintain the flying status of sufficient men and women fell by 1,641. That number of young men and women trained as aviators decided they no longer could remain on active duty and would return to civilian opportunities. Many of those decisions were dictated by their concern for their families. But stop to think of what it costs every American taxpayer to replace that in-dividual in that airplane, to train the number of new recruits to be pilots or navigators or to take to sea in those combat airplanes. I ran that calculation. It costs rough- ly between $2 million to $6 million, de-pending on the type of aircraft, to train a man or a woman to become an aviator, $2 million to $6 million. If you multiply the average of that times 1,641, it is $9 billion just to replace the aviators. That same drain on trained manpower, womanpower in the mili-tary occurs in other branches of the service where perhaps their training is not as costly to the taxpayer but $9 bil-lion just to close the gap for those fly-ing aircraft. Let us think about the families, as my good friend from North Dakota de-scribed, the farm community. Let us talk about the military, what those wives and their children, what those aviators are doing in harm's way today. They are carrying out the or-ders of the President of the United States, as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. This Nation is but one of 19 nations locked together in the first combat operation in the 50-year history of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This is a critical moment for fami- lies, be they farm families or military families. Mr. President, as I said, support the emergency supplemental appropria-tions bill now before the Senate. As chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, I join with my colleague and close working partner on defense mat-ters, the chairman of the Appropria-tions Committee, to urge all our col-leagues to support our military forces by voting for this bill. I support this bill for one simple rea- son\u2014we are at war. As we speak, we have military forces engaged in com-bat\u2014going in harm's way\u2014in the skies over the Balkans and Iraq. Whether or not there is agreement on how these risk-taking operations are being pros-ecuted is not now the question. We must support our military forces who are risking their lives daily to carry out the missions they have been as-signed. Mr. President, the conflict in Kosovo has been ongoing since March 24, when the NATO use of force began. Since that time our pilots and the pilots of our allies have flown thousands of com-bat missions against Milosevic's mili-tary machine. We have already spent billions of dollars\u2014on both aircraft op-erations and munitions\u2014in support of Operation Allied Force. These funds are now coming out of the readiness ac-counts of our military services. With-out this supplemental, there would be further and unacceptable degradation of the readiness of our forces. The conference agreement provides $10.9 billion for defense, including $2.2 billion above the President's request for aircraft flying hours, spare parts, depot maintenance and munitions, in-cluding sophisticated precision-guided missiles and bombs, which allow our pi-lots to be more effective at reduced risk\u2014both to them and to innocent ci-vilians on the ground. Mr. President, I know that some of my colleagues have expressed concern regarding the funds provided in this bill for pay raises, pay table reform and retirement reform. I firmly believe that all my colleagues would agree that we have very serious problems of recruiting and retention in our mili-tary services. I believe the problems are of such magnitude\u2014indeed, we have a hemorrhaging of skilled personnel leaving our military\u2014that this situa-tion qualifies as an emergency. As an example, both the Army and the Navy failed to meet their 1998 recruiting goals and the Army, Navy, and the Air Force project that they will not meet their recruiting goals for 1999. Last year, 1641 more pilots left the service than the Department of Defense projected. It costs about $6 million to train a single pilot. The cost to replace these 1641 pilots is more than $9 billion. We must act to stop this hemmorhage of pilots and other skilled military per-sonnel. We must send a signal now that we in the Congress intend to take care of our military personnel and their families. I know that there are Senators who are concerned about this process, and there are Senators who disagree with some of the items in this emergency supplemental. I share some of these concerns. But, Mr. President, as I stat-ed earlier, our Nation is at war. We can argue the process and our other con-cerns at another time. I believe that now is the time for the Senate to show its support for our men and women in uniform who are, as we speak, carrying out their assigned mis-sions under difficult and dangerous conditions. I will vote for this bill, and I strongly urge my colleagues to do likewise. Mr. President, I yield the floor. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5662 May 20, 1999 Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Louisiana. Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from West Virginia. I appreciate his work on this very important measure for our country at this time. I was here in the Chamber and got to hear the remarkable speech of the dis-tinguished Senator from North Dakota. He is absolutely correct. There is not enough money in this supplemental ap-propriations bill to address the devas-tation that we are experiencing throughout rural America. My State in particular has been hard hit because of weather-related disasters, the worst drought in over a century occurred last year. It is my hope that in the months ahead we will all, on both sides of this aisle, Democrats and Republicans, be more mindful of the tremendous dif-ficulty that rural America is experi-encing and come up with additional and real ways of helping that lead us to a more market-oriented approach but recognize that there are some safety nets and some bridges that need to be put in place that are not there yet, and it is causing great pain throughout America. However, I want to point out that in this supplemental, partly because of the fine work by the Senator from North Dakota and others, we have added a half billion dollars for much- needed farm relief. It is not enough, but it is better than nothing. Farmers in my State in Louisiana and in many States around the Nation are depend-ing on us today to vote favorably to-ward this measure and to send them this help. Every day in my office the phone rings with farmers needing their emergency assistance that was prom-ised to them last year but not forth-coming. It is estimated from our agriculture commissioner that there are over 300 to 400 farmers that are just barely holding on, waiting for these checks and this assistance so that they can make fu-ture plans. It is important. It is not enough money in this bill, but it is better than what it started out to be. Because of the leadership, a half billion dollars has been added. I am happy to say that a great deal of that money will go to help Louisiana and other States in our area. This package includes much-needed emergency assistance to farmers in Louisiana and other agriculture States still reeling from last year's extreme weather conditions. Mr. President, I will never forget the faces of farmers in my home State as they showed me acre after acre of scorched row crops, or how shocking it was to see the horrible cracks and cra-ters in what was once fertile soil. This package, Mr. President, includes additional assistance to replenish the fiscal year 1999 emergency loan ac-count, which has been depleted due to the severity of this crisis. Hundreds have received help but, right now more than 300 farm families in Louisiana are waiting for their emergency loan applications to come through. And although more assistance may still be needed, those loan pay-ments are crucial to help our farmers stay in business. Mr. President, hurricane victims in Central America are also waiting on this emergency package. In fact, they've been waiting for more than 6 months. The winds and rains of Hurricane Mitch claimed the lives of more than 10,000 people, and left an estimated 1 million homeless. It completely wiped out hundreds of schoolhouses, bridges, roadways, and churches. But after vis-iting Honduras and Nicaragua, I can assure you the numbers fail to convey the full extent of the devastation. Besides the obvious humanitarian reasons, helping our Central American neighbors recover serves the long-term interests not only of the United States but the entire Western Hemisphere. Within the past few decades, we have seen Central America move from con-flict to peace, from authoritarian gov-ernments to democracies, from closed to open economies. Now this progress is at risk. In the past, the United States has played a strong role in encouraging economic development in Central America. Nearly four decades ago, President Kennedy traveled to Costa Rica to an-nounce his ''Alliance for Progress'' to promote the expansion of agriculture exports throughout the region. Since then we have pursued a variety of other measures designed to help these countries diversify their econo-mies and boost exports. While these policies have not always been successful, the United States has always shown its willingness to help lift these economically depressed na-tions to a more prosperous standard of living. The point is\u2014the United States has a long history of helping our Central American friends move further down the path of development. Now\u2014per-haps\u2014that friendship is being tested by the devastation that has decimated their towns and villages and the com-merce that flows through them. But, as we all know, friendships be- come stronger when they are tested. And I am glad that the United States is responding like good friends should. I am also particularly pleased that this supplemental package will be used in part to addresses the problem of per-manent housing in Central America. During a historic meeting\u2014hosted by Senators L OTTand C OVERDELL \u2014held in the LBJ Room several months ago, four Central American Presidents made it clear that permanent housing is among the highest priorities for their recovery. The numbers say it best: Mitch destroyed 700,000 homes, severely damaged 50,000 and left 35,000 people in temporary housing\u2014tents, schools, churches. I will be working\u2014along with other colleagues on both sides of the aisle\u2014 to see that we do all we can in the area of housing in Central America. Helping Central America rebuild is of special concern in Louisiana. With one of the largest Honduran communities outside Honduras, New Orleans is sometimes referred to as ''the third largest Honduran city.'' Brought to our State through trade with the port, these enterprising people have been a source of strength to our community for many years now. So this package is of utmost importance to them and so many others back home. Before yielding the floor, Mr. Presi- dent, let me also express my support for the increase in military spending in this supplemental. Over the last decade, we have seen a slow, steady decline in the recruitment and retention of our military men and women. We have allowed the dispari-ties between military and private sec-tor to grow so large that our service men and women are being lured away. For instance, B-52 pilots at Barksdale Airforce Base in Shreveport, LA, can go right down the street to the Shreveport International Airport and sign on with a commercial airline with better salaries, pensions, and benefits. It is imperative that we reverse this trend. Mr. President, my hope is that these military spending increases will mark a good step forward in helping us recruit and retain the best and the brightest. In closing, let me say again how im- portant this Emergency Supplemental Package is to farmers in Louisiana and other rural communities in America. And as we consider the interests of our Nation and this hemisphere\u2014and the future of the fragile democracies in them\u2014on the edge of this new century, let us make sure we honor our ties of friendship with the nations of Central America. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from West Virginia is recognized. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Illinois, Mr. D URBIN . Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from West Virginia and my leader on the Appropriations Committee, and my friend, Senator S TEVENS from Alaska, who is not present on the floor; he is also the chairman of this important committee. You can measure the values of a na- tion by the way it spends its money. If you take a look at this bill, you will see that the values of America are strong in many areas. We are prepared to spend $6 billion to make sure that the men and women in uniform in Kosovo have the very best. Were it my son or daughter, I would demand noth-ing less. I am sure we all feel the same. We are spending hundreds of millions of dollars for humanitarian relief. Isn't it typically American that no matter what our sacrifice, we are willing to help others, whether it is the refugees VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5663 May 20, 1999 in Kosovo or those suffering from the hurricane in Central America. Many other good things are in this bill. I was happy to be part of an effort to provide financial assistance to those who have been in the pork production industry and have been hard hit during the last year. Senator B ONDand I have worked for $145 million to try to help some of these farmers to face the toughest times in their lives. Net farm income in Illinois is down 78 percent. Farmland in Illinois is some of the best in the country, yet farmers have seen this dramatic decline in income. With all these good things in the bill, it would seem fairly obvious to vote for it without reservation. I wish I could. I plan on voting for it, but with serious reservations. Let me tell you what they relate to. When this bill came from the White House, the President asked for $6 bil-lion for military and humanitarian as-sistance, and then the House added $5 billion in military spending which the President didn't ask for. Among other things in this bill is $500 million for military construction around the world that is not authorized, not requested. It is put in here. When I went to the conference with Senator B YRD and Senator S TEVENS , the Senate side of the aisle said we are going to propose an amendment that I offered\u2014$265 million for American schools. You have heard of all the things I have mentioned. There is not a penny in this bill for American schools\u2014nothing. Are schools on our minds? You bet they are. Cities like Conyers, GA; Littleton, CO; Jonesboro, AR; West Paducah, KY; Pearl, MS; Springfield, OR. The sad roster of schools in America that have been hit by school violence continues to grow. I produced an amendment for $265 million for two things\u2014not radical new suggestions but tried and true things such as school counselors so that kids who are troubled and have a problem have somebody to turn to, and after-school programs so that kids are super-vised in a positive, safe learning envi-ronment. The House conferees rejected that. Not a penny for schools, not $265 million. Not a penny for schools, but $5 billion more in military spending than this President requested. Where are our values? Where are our priorities? If our priorities are not in the schoolrooms and classrooms of America, if they are not with our chil-dren, where are our values? I salute what is in this bill. Much is good. But it pains me greatly to stand on the floor of the Senate and say that in a conference committee only a few days ago the idea of sending money to America's schools for America's schoolchildren was soundly rejected by the House conferees. That makes no sense whatsoever. We will talk in the juvenile justice bill about how to reduce crime in America, how to reduce violence, and we should. We will talk about gun con-trol, and I support it. But there is more to it. We have to be able to reach out to those kids who show up at school every day with a world of hurt, a world of problems, kids who probably see school as the only shelter, the only nurturing environment, in their lives. These kids need a helping hand, and with this helping hand they can be bet-ter students and better Americans. We missed an opportunity in this bill by denying one penny for those schools. We missed that opportunity. I am sorry to say that this bill does not include it. But I promise you this. As long as I serve in the Senate, I will join with those in the Senate and, I hope, others in the House, who come to the realization that there is no greater pri-ority than our children. I yield back the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Virginia, Mr. R OBB. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Virginia is recognized. Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from West Vir-ginia and the ranking member on the Appropriations Committee. Like our other colleagues, I commend him and the distinguished Senator from Alaska for their hard work on this particular proposal we will be voting on today. I regret that I am not able to support this particular bill because there is so much in it that I do support. I clearly recognize the critical need for addi-tional spending for our military. In-deed, we are not spending enough on our military today, even with the emergency spending that is legiti-mately included in this bill for the cri-sis in Kosovo. We are going to have to spend even more if we are going to meet our commitments around the world and provide the national security that we're expected to provide\u2014and in-deed that we profess to be able to pro-vide. We are not spending enough money on ships, or planes, or ammuni-tion, or on quality of life improve-ments for members of our Armed Serv-ices. We are going to have to address those needs, even beyond what is pro-vided in this bill. I am embarrassed by the fact that we're just now getting around to fund-ing the emergencies that occurred as a result of Hurricane Mitch, and the needs of our farmers are acute and crit-ical. There is simply no excuse for the delay in providing the emergency fund-ing in these areas. The concern I have is with the process. We cannot con-tinue to do business this way. If we de-termine that this is an emergency spending measure, we ought to make sure that what we are funding are true emergencies and take care of our other priorities through the normal author-ization and appropriations process. We have the promise of a surplus. We ought not to abandon the fiscal respon-sibility that brought us that promise and has given us the chance to make real progress on debt reduction. We should not use the fact that we have our men and women in harm's way overseas as an excuse to go on a spend-ing binge here at home. Many of the projects in this bill have merit. If it is an emergency, it ought to be in this bill. And we ought to take out the non-emergency spending, pass a clean bill, and get the emergency spending where it is needed, especially to our military. In short, Mr. President, providing substantial emergency funding for our troops in Kosovo is the right thing to do. Providing long-overdue emergency funding for the victims of Hurricane Mitch is the right thing to do. And pro-viding desperately needed emergency funding for our nation's farmers is the right thing to do. But combining these legitimate emergency requests with billions of dollars of nonemergency spending\u2014no matter how meritorious the individual project\u2014is the wrong way to do it. With that, I yield back any time I may have. With great regret, I an-nounce that I am unable to support the bill, although I fully support many of the priorities the bill includes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 7 12 minutes to Mr. G RAHAM . The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Florida. PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent that Colton Campbell be afforded floor privileges during the duration of my remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will reluctantly support this legislation be-cause it contains important issues. It contains the funding for our troops in the Balkans. It contains the funds to meet our humanitarian responsibilities to our neighbors in Central America and the Caribbean. It also retains a provision\u2014which I know the Presiding Officer has strongly supported\u2014to clearly state that the funds the States secured through their tobacco settle-ments will be funds to be managed, ad-ministered, and prioritized at the State level. Mr. President, I share many of the concerns of my colleague from Vir-ginia. I share those concerns because what we are doing is to chip away at the financial security of 38 million Americans\u201438 million Americans who receive Social Security income. Forty percent of those 38 million Americans would have fallen below the poverty line but for Social Security. Why is this relevant to this debate? It is relevant because we are on the verge of draining an additional $12 bil-lion from the Social Security fund through this legislation. We had three choices when we started this debate. One choice was to do the tough thing, to reprioritize our spending, to say that if it is important that we spend money on our humanitarian needs in VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5664 May 20, 1999 Central America and the Caribbean, then let us reduce spending somewhere else. I am pleased to say that for that ac- count we in fact have done so. We had another choice, which was to say let's raise revenue. If we can't find an area where we think it is appro-priate to reduce spending, then let's be prepared to pay for this emergency. Third, we could say let's use the ac- cumulated surplus that we have, which today is a 100-percent surplus gen-erated by the Social Security trust fund. As to the $12 billion in this legis-lation, we have elected the third course of action. Mr. President, this is not the first time we have done so. In fact, it is not the first time in the last 8 months that we have done so. Last October, in the waning hours of the budget negotiations, Congress passed a $532 billion omnibus appro-priations bill. Tucked into that bill was $21.4 billion in so-called emergency spending. The effect of that designation then\u2014 as it is today\u2014was to relieve Congress of the necessity of finding some other reprioritized spending to eliminate in order to pay for this emergency. But because of the emergency des- ignation, the $21.4 billion in October could be approved without offsets, and because of the emergency designation today, we will approve an additional $12 billion of expenditure without off-sets. Let's look at the numbers. In 1998, Social Security was $99 bil- lion. The first use of that money was to offset $27 billion in deficit in the rest of the Federal budget. An additional $3 billion was used to pay for emergency outlays, leaving us with a total surplus not of $99 billion but of $69 billion. This year, 1999, we are projecting a $127 billion surplus. Again, we have used $3 billion to off- set deficits elsewhere in the budget, $13 billion for emergency outlays, and we are about to spend another $14.6 billion for emergencies, reducing our surplus from $127 billion down to $96 billion. And for the year 2000, we have already carried forward some of the emergency spending from 1999. Again, we will be reducing the Social Security surplus by $10 billion. This is from where we are paying for these emergencies. Mr. President, the repetitive misuse of the emergency process is continuing to erode the Social Security trust fund. This misuse is done in a manner that precludes most Members of Congress from any meaningful role in what has traditionally been accepted as emer-gencies. We have been denied the op-portunity to participate in a deter-mination as to whether the proposed emergency expenditure met the stand-ards of being sudden, urgent and un-foreseen needs, which is the standard that has traditionally been used for emergencies. The same Congress that claimed to be saving the surplus for Social Secu-rity\u2014committed to a ''lockbox'' for So- cial Security\u2014is again actively partici-pating in raids on the Social Security trust fund through the back door. Willie Sutton once was asked, ''Why do you rob banks?'' His answer: ''That's where the money is.'' We may manufacture the strongest vault to protect the Social Security surplus from Willie Sutton. But if we let Jesse James continue to steal the money on the train before it gets to the bank, we will have the same result. The money will not be there for our and future generations of Social Secu-rity beneficiaries. Social Security is a federally man- dated program. We have a legal obliga-tion to our children and grandchildren to secure the surplus for its intended purpose\u2014Social Security. We must as-sure that the budget surplus is not squandered on questionable emergency items in the future. Mr. President, with your support and that of Senator S NOWE of Maine, we have introduced legislation which has as its objective to establish permanent safeguards that will assure that non-emergency items are subject to careful scrutiny and not inserted into emer-gency spending bills to circumvent the normal legislative process. I urge our colleagues' support for this legislation. Mr. President, as we adjust to the welcome reality of budget surpluses\u2014 after decades of annual deficits and burgeoning additions to the national debt\u2014we must never forget how easily this valuable asset can be squandered. For too long, the Federal Govern- ment treated the budget like a credit card with an unlimited spending limit. Private citizens are warned against falsely dialing 911. Congress should ex-ercise the same restraint in using its emergency authority. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Mississippi. Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an additional 10 minutes be authorized for debate on this measure, and that 8 of those min-utes be under the control of the Sen-ator from West Virginia, Mr. B YRD, and 2 minutes be under the control of this Senator. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. H ARKIN . The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Iowa. Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, let me just say that being for or against this bill is basically a tossup, as far as I am concerned. It is one of those 51-49 types of propositions. So that is how I am going to come down on the 51-percent side, and vote for the conference re-port. First of all, this is not a time to indi- cate anything less than full support for our troops in Kosovo and the sur- rounding areas. There is also in this conference re- port some much-needed farm assist-ance and disaster assistance for the United States and Central America. However, I must say there are parts of the bill to which I register my stiff op-position. First, this bill forfeits the oppor- tunity to ensure that tobacco settle-ment money is used to fight smoking and to promote health\u2014that is not in here. In fact, just the opposite. Second, the bill provides only a frac- tion of critically and urgently needed farm assistance. Let me just talk for a moment about that subject. This is an emergency supplemental appropriations bill. We take care of emergencies in Central America and other places. But one of the very big-gest emergencies facing us today is the emergency in American agriculture. Export prospects are dismal. Exports for this year are projected to fall to $49 billion, which is a 19-percent decline from 1996. Asia still hasn't recovered. Net farm income for major commod-ities could drop to $17 billion compared to an average of $23 billion a year for the previous 5 years. Net farm income for major field crops will be 27 percent below what it was for the last 5 years. It is true that there is some farm as- sistance in this package, and I was pleased to work with my colleagues to get it in the bill. But it is not enough, and it is too late. The White House sent up the supple- mental appropriations request for addi-tional farm loan funds and Farm Serv-ice Agency funding on February 26. Now here we are just getting to it, nearly three months later. This money was critically and ur- gently needed for the planting season. Now we are just getting around to it, even though the planting season is well over halfway past. The farm assistance that we have in the bill is good. Sure, an aspirin is good, if you have a major illness and you have some pain. But it doesn't get to the real root cause of it, and neither does the assistance in this bill. It falls far short of what is needed. I offered an amendment in the con- ference committee to address the deep-ening crisis in the farm economy. The amendment addressed a range of farm income problems in the crop, livestock and dairy sectors, and it dealt with ag-riculture's economic crisis around our nation, not just in one or two regions. Regrettably, that amendment failed on a 14-14 tie vote of Senate conferees. The amendment lacked just one vote. So we will be back again on whatever measures we can get up on the floor this year to provide critically and ur-gently needed economic assistance to our farm families and our rural com-munities. All I can say is that when it came to the issue of Kosovo, we were willing to meet our obligations and respond to the emergency. In fact, the conferees had no trouble coming up with $5 bil-lion more than what was asked for in VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5665 May 20, 1999 military spending. But we couldn't come up with the money needed to help our beleaguered farmers and the rural economy. Finally, I also want to say a word about offsets for this bill. For the small portion of the bill that is offset, there was a beeline to go after pro-grams that are vital to the most vul-nerable in our society: food stamps and housing. Hunger and poverty remain persistent and pervasive problems in our society. Now we know these rescis-sions are not genuine offsets, since there are not outlay reductions associ-ated with them. So perhaps there is no harm, but clearly these offsets should not lay the groundwork or create a precedent for future rescissions that actually reduce program benefits. Again, on the whole, I will vote for the conference report. I just want to register my objections to two major portions of the conference report, farm assistance and tobacco, which I consider to be totally inad-equate. I yield the floor and yield the re- mainder of my time. NEEDED SUPPORT FOR THE PAN AM 103 FAMILIES Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, a sig- nificant provision in the 1999 Kosovo supplemental appropriations bill will enable the Justice Department to pay for the travel expenses of the Pan Am 103 families who wish to attend the up-coming Lockerbie bombing trial in The Netherlands this summer. Existing law prevents the Department from using federal funds to pay for this travel. Under this provision, the Justice De- partment's Office of Victims of Crime will be able to use an existing reserve fund to pay for the transportation costs, lodging, and food at government per diem rates for immediate family members of the Pan Am 103 victims. The Department also plans to establish an 800 number and a web site to keep family members informed during the trial. In addition, the Department plans to establish a compassion center, staffed with counselors, at the base in The Netherlands where the trial will be held, in order to help the families cope with the emotional strains of the trial. The families of the victims of this terrorist atrocity have been waiting for more than ten years for justice. They have suffered the deep pain of losing their loved ones, and that pain has been compounded by the Libyan Gov-ernment's refusal for many years to surrender the suspects accused of the bombing. Now the suspects are finally in custody and the trial will begin soon. We can never erase the pain of the loss that the families have suffered, but we can enable them to attend the trial and see that justice is finally done. I commend the House and Senate conferees for including this important provision to help these long-suffering families. Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, in the past, American presidents have ar-gued that a congressional appropria-tion for U.S. military action abroad constitutes a congressional authoriza- tion for the military action. I will not vote for an authorization of money that may be construed as authorizing, or encouraging the expansion of, the President's military operations in Kosovo. I will oppose the appropriation of almost $11 billion for a war I have consistently spoken out against. On March 23, I voted against Presi- dent Clinton's decision to launch the air campaign in Yugoslovia. On May 4, I voted against a resolution that would have given the President blanket au-thority to expand the operation. To date, I have not been convinced that this war is necessary to protect a vital national security interest, and I have opposed efforts to escalate the conflict. I have a number of secondary consid- erations with respect to this legisla-tion. I am concerned, for one, about plundering the Social Security trust funds to pay for a war that involves no vital national security interest. If I be-lieved that vital national security in-terests were at stake, I would consider the argument to fund the war from the Social Security trust fund surplus. But in the absence of a vital national secu-rity interest, I do not believe the Con-gress should pay for the war out of the Social Security trust funds. I am also concerned about some of the anti-environmental riders added to the emergency supplemental bill in conference. These provisions should have been fully debated, and should have gone through the normal legisla-tive process, instead of being slipped into the bill in the dead of night. I am disappointed that I can't sup- port this bill, because it contains fund-ing for farmers hit by low commodity prices. Some of this is funding that I've argued for and, in fact, voted for in ear-lier instances, including S. 544. But my opposition to funding the military ac-tion in Kosovo is firm. I can endorse neither the authorization for the war, nor the appropriations process that is its genesis. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. I NHOFE ). Who yields time? Mr. BYRD. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Con-necticut, Mr. D ODD. Mr. DODD. I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. Mr. President, I rise to support the Conference Report of H.R. 1141\u2014the Emergency Supplemental Appropria-tions Bill before us today. I do so reluc-tantly, however, because of the many special interest riders that have been attached to this emergency legislation. In the final analysis I will support the conference report because it provides critically important funds to assist American farmers, to support ongoing action against Yugoslavia, to relieve the suffering of Kosovar refugees, and to help Central America recover from the devastating effects of Hurricane Mitch. In light of all the other measures that have been added to this bill, many of dubious merit, I deeply regret, Mr. President, that the Speaker of the House refused to allow House conferees to accept a Senate amendment that would have freed up monies for pay-ment of the United States debt to the United Nations. I find it somewhat puz-zling that House Republicans are on record calling for a negotiated settle-ment of the Kosovo conflict, yet are not prepared to provide overdue pay-ments to the organization that will likely play a central role in imple-menting any peace agreement. I would like to dwell on two major provisions of this bill which I support, namely the aid to help Central America recover from the damage caused by Hurricane Mitch and the funds to sustain our on-going efforts in the Balkans. The funds aimed at helping Central America recover from Hurricane Mitch stem from an emergency request the President made back in February. It is extremely embarrassing that it has taken until May for the Congress to fi-nally get around to passing the nec-essary legislation to provide relief for a natural disaster that occurred last fall. I cannot overstate the degree to which the storm ravaged Nicaragua, Honduras and other nearby nations. In less than a week, Hurricane Mitch claimed at least 10,000 lives\u2014possibly as many as 20,000, left more than a mil-lion others without adequate food or shelter, and set the economies of Nica-ragua and Honduras back as much as a generation. The need for long-term international assistance is great. In late October and early November 1998, Mitch carved a slow, meandering and deadly path through the Carib-bean. At the hurricane's apex, Mitch's storm clouds stretched from Florida to Panama and wind gusts topped 200 miles per hour. Meteorologists labeled Mitch a ''Category 5 Hurricane,'' the highest such designation. Unlike other hurricanes, Mr. Presi- dent, it was not Mitch's winds which proved so deadly. By the time the storm crossed the Honduran Coast on October 29, 1998, its winds had slowed to 60 miles per hour and the storm's movement to a mere crawl. The tor-rential rain, however, did not abate. The storm's slow speed allowed it to continually pound the same area day after day. By the time the skies cleared, Mitch had dropped five feet of rain onto Honduras and Nicaragua. The massive flooding which followed claimed the lives of at least 10,000 Cen- tral Americans. That number, Mr. President, is certainly shocking. Yet, sadly, it is probably an understatement of the actual loss of life. As many as twelve thousand other people in the re-gion are still missing and presumed dead. The Honduran government has declared 5,657 dead and 8,052 officially missing. In Nicaragua, at least 3,800 died. Smaller numbers perished in El Salvador, Guatemala and other coun-tries in the region. Mr. President, not since the Great Hurricane of 1780, nearly 220 years ago, has a storm claimed so many lives in the eastern Caribbean. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5666 May 20, 1999 Mitch also destroyed or damaged 338 bridges, 170 in Honduras alone, leaving much of Honduras and Nicaragua ac-cessible only by helicopter. The lack of helicopters in the region and their lim-ited capacity left thousands without adequate food and water for weeks while some of the food provided by international aid organizations rotted at the airport. Those who survived face the task of piecing the economy and mangled in-frastructure back together. Meanwhile, more than a million people throughout the region, including one out of every five Hondurans, had to rebuild their homes and replace their personal pos-sessions. Honduran and Nicaraguan agri- culture\u2014a vital component of both economies\u2014was decimated. Hurricane Mitch destroyed a quarter of Honduras's coffee plantations and 90 percent of the country's banana plants. The entire shrimp farming industry was destroyed. Damage to sugar and citrus crops was similarly heavy. The factories and farms of Honduras's Sula Valley, which normally contribute 60 percent of the country's GDP, were all flooded. While Nicaragua was not as badly damaged, the effects are still staggering: 20 percent of the nation's coffee plantations were destroyed. Newer crops such as citrus were com-pletely annihilated. The process of rebuilding the shat- tered lives, infrastructure and econo-mies of Honduras and Nicaragua will be long and expensive. The World Bank and the United Nations Development Program estimate the total damage to the region at more than $5.3 billion. While these numbers are difficult to comprehend, they are even more daunting given that the GDP of Nica-ragua is only $9.3 billion and that of Honduras only $12.7 billion. I commend my colleagues for finding the resources to assist our neighbors to the south who have called upon the international community in their hour of need. It is not only in their interest, it is in our interest to assist them. It deserves our strong backing. The original intent of the President's request for emergency appropriations from the Congress was to provide our men and women in uniform with the equipment and materiel they need to effectively strike the Yugoslav mili-tary. While I am heartened by recent reports of a possible diplomatic solu-tion, we must remain prepared to con-tinue our military efforts in the ab-sence of an enforceable diplomatic so-lution which meets NATO's conditions. Mr. President, we must never take the decision to send our service men and women into harm's way lightly. If a situation which is such an anathema to the United States that it calls for military action presents itself to us, however, we must vigorously support our soldiers, sailors and airmen through both word and deed. As I just mentioned, the decision to send our military into battle is one of the most solemn that this body or this nation ever faces. And so, before I go on, let me reiterate why the situation in Kosovo justifies, in fact demands, American military involvement. Slobodan Milosevic has carved a place for himself amongst history's most despicable tyrants. Serb forces have murdered least 5,000 ethnic-Alba-nian civilians and burned six hundred villages. To date, approximately 80 per-cent of Kosovar Albanians\u2014more than 1.3 million innocent men, women and children\u2014have fled their homes in a desperate attempt to outrun Serb mili-tary and police forces. Nearly 750,000 Kosovar Albanians have made it to the relative safety of neighboring coun-tries and are now living under the most difficult of conditions. These numbers, however horrific, tell only part of the story. They cannot ex-press the pain of a family torn apart by blood-thirsty paramilitary policemen or the pain of a young woman gang- raped by Serb soldiers. They do not ex-press the tears of a young child who spends each day wandering between the tents of a Macedonian refugee camp searching for his or her missing par-ents. They do not describe the pain, both physical and psychological, the victims of torture feel each day. Many members of Congress, myself included, have traveled to the region and visited the refugee camps. We have seen the pain in the eyes of the refu-gees fortunate enough to have made it out of the killing fields of Kosovo. Mr. President, the look in the eyes of these refugees defies description. The ongoing genocide in Kosovo is antithetical to the most basic prin-ciples on which the United States stands. By acting to preserve the fun-damental rights of Kosovar Albanians, the United States is reaffirming our be-lief that all people are endowed with certain inalienable rights, including the rights to life, liberty and the pur-suit of happiness. If, however, the United States chose to stand idly by in the face of such grotesque evil, we would draw into question our dedica-tion to human rights and our resolve to oppose dictators around the globe. Our military, however, cannot effec- tively combat this evil if we in the Congress fail to offer them our support. One month ago, President Clinton sent a request to Congress for $6 billion in order to fund our military operations through the end of the fiscal year. That money is included in this bill. As we debate this issue, people far be- yond the walls of this chamber are lis-tening to our words and watching our actions. Our men and women in uni-form throughout the region who are putting their lives on the line each day want to know whether we in the Con-gress will seize this opportunity to sup-port them. They need and they deserve the very finest equipment our nation can muster\u2014the type of equipment the President's original request will pay for. In capitals across Europe, our allies are listening and looking to the United States for leadership. They want to know whether the United States will maintain its commitment to NATO and to this important operation. In refugee camps in Albania, Mac- edonia, Montenegro and elsewhere, hundreds of thousands of Milosevic's innocent victims are listening; hoping that we will reaffirm our commitment to them. In the hills and forests of Kosovo, men, women and children who are hid-ing from soldiers and policemen are lis-tening to American radio broadcasts on portable radios. They are looking to the United States for hope and support in their most desperate hour. And finally, tyrants around the world, but especially in Belgrade, are judging our dedication to human rights and freedom. Mr. President, we must send the same message to all: The United States will not back down in the face of un-speakable evil. Just a moment ago, I mentioned that the President requested $6 billion for the ongoing operation in the Balkans. In just one month, however, that $6 bil-lion bill has ballooned into a $14.9 bil-lion monstrosity. The President's original request now represents well under half of the total bill. Regretfully, the majority of the new spending is for non-emergency pro-grams which fall far outside the origi-nal intention of the legislation. Such programs should rightfully be left to the regular appropriations process. The issues this bill was intended to address are simply too important to be em-broiled in political spending. Thus, while I continue to support strongly the President's original request, I sup-port the legislation before us with re-luctance due to the expensive, non- emergency riders that were added dur-ing the House/Senate conference on this measure. Mr. President, the provisions of this bill relating to Kosovo and Central America deserve our immediate atten-tion and support. The victims of moth-er nature's fury in our own hemisphere and of Slobodan Milosevic's genocide in Europe, as well as the brave American men and women fighting under the American flag, need and deserve Amer-ica's support. For that reason I intend to vote to support passage of this con-ference report despite its imperfec-tions. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distin- guished Senator from North Carolina, Mr. H ELMS , has a very distinguished guest whom he wishes to present. I therefore yield for that purpose. I ask unanimous consent that no time be charged to the remaining speakers because of that fact, and I ask unanimous consent following the intro-duction by Senator H ELMS , there be a recess of 3 minutes so Senators may personally greet the distinguished guest. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5667 May 20, 1999 VISIT TO THE SENATE BY KING ABDALLAH BIN HUSSEIN Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the dis- tinguished Senator from West Virginia, as always, is gracious, and I thank him very much. As he indicated, we have today a distinguished son of a distin-guished father who has visited many times. His Majesty, King Abdallah bin Hussein of Jordan. He has been visiting with the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee and I present him to the Senate. f RECESS Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate stand in recess for 3 minutes. There being no objection, the Senate, at 3:37 p.m., recessed until 3:42 p.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the very able and eloquent distinguished Senator from California, Mrs. B OXER . The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from California. Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise for the first time since I have been in the Senate to oppose a supplemental appro-priation. It hurts my heart because there is so much in this bill that is good. But I have to say there is a lot in this bill that does not belong in it, and there are some things left out of this bill, one or two things, that I thought were real emergencies that should have been in there. What started out as requests to fund unexpected emergencies has turned into a flurry of spending and riders that simply do not belong in this bill. The one area that I particularly cared about, violence in our schools\u2014which is an emergency by anybody's measure when parents are telling us, 75 percent of them, they are concerned about their children when they go off to school\u2014a very modest proposal by the Senator from Illinois was turned down by the House members of the con-ference after it was approved by the Senate members of the conference. So all kinds of dollars were found for many things, but they could not find it in their hearts to do something about violence in the schools by providing some counselors, some afterschool money so desperately needed in our country today. I am happy for the Senator from West Virginia, that he was able to get a commitment for a crisis he is facing in the steel industry in his State. I agreed with him, that particular piece of legislation and those funds should have been placed into this bill, and they were not. So I found this a very strange conference. I miss the Appro-priations Committee. I was on it for two beautiful years. So I sat and watched at 1 in the morning as Sen-ators and House Members debated. You may wonder, why would the Senator from California do that? Very simple: It is a very important bill that is be-fore us. I believe in what NATO is trying to accomplish. I agreed with the Presi-dent that we needed to find about $6 billion for the military. It turns out it is almost double that, that winds up in this bill. The pay raise is taken care of. I wanted to do an even higher pay raise, but that pay raise\u2014it is not an emergency, it is an obligation. We have to back the pay raise in the regular ap-propriations bills. This is just another way to push dollars around. I do not think it is fair to say that is an emergency. I supported the funds in there for America's farmers, for Hurri-cane Mitch; those things were fine. But some of the riders in this bill really were wrong, not only wrong in sub-stance but wrong to put in this bill. For example, the rider that deals with the tobacco funds from the tobacco lawsuit. It is not that I object that the Federal Government will not get a share of that\u2014because I am willing to say it is fine, the Governors are the ones who put their names out there and they should get these funds. But to say to the Governors who are getting our part of the reimbursement: By the way, spend it any way you like\u2014we are going to see Governors use that money to put a swimming pool in the Gov-ernor's mansion; we are going to see Governors use that to build a little street in the neighborhood where maybe some of their donors live. I do not come from the school of thought that Governors are better than Senators. I think we run on a platform and most of us, most of us from both parties, believe we need to take care of the health care needs of our people. Comes along this bill, comes along a rider that says: Governors, you can spend that any way you want. Build a running track for your friends around the Governor's mansion? Fine, no prob-lem, no strings. I have a problem with that. We should make sure our Gov-ernors are taking care of the health needs of their citizens since part of that money rightly comes from a re-covery that included Federal pro-grams\u2014Medicaid, as an example. Then there are three riders that deal with the environment in one way or the other. One has to do with oil royal-ties. This is about the third time that antienvironmental rider has been placed in this bill, because colleagues know they cannot get the votes here. It is stopping the Interior Department from collecting the rent payments or the royalty payments from oil compa-nies who drill on Federal land, tax-payers' land. That money is being sto-len from us. How do I know that? Be-cause there have been lawsuits. And every time the Federal Government wins those lawsuits\u2014I ask for 1 addi-tional minute, if I might. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining under my control? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator has 18 minutes remaining. Mr. BYRD. I yield 1 more minute to the Senator. Mrs. BOXER. So here we have a situ- ation where the Interior Department could use the money to help with our parks and open space, and the oil com-panies get another special rider on this bill. It is the third time that has hap-pened. Mr. President, I do not think that is the way to legislate. Then we have an environmental rider placed in the bill by Senator G ORTON who now, I understand, is not even going to vote for this bill which has his rider in it that does tremendous dam-age to the State of Washington by per-mitting a mine up there. There are so many things in this bill that do not belong in it. So it is with a heavy heart I say to my friends, for whom I have great respect, I cannot vote for this. I do not think everything in there is truly an emergency. Yet I think those things that were emer-gencies were left out. I look forward to working with my friends in the regular order so we can debate some of these important meas-ures outside this so-called emergency designation. I yield the floor. Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I will vote against the pending conference re-port because I believe it, and the policy and process behind it, represent a shameful failure on behalf of our Amer-ican servicemen and women now in harm's way in the Balkans. This legislation before the Senate today displays exactly what's wrong with Washington, including the United States Senate. There is much in the pending conference report on Supple-mental Appropriations which is ur-gently needed and which I support. American farmers need and deserve the disaster assistance included in this leg-islation. The Kosovar refugees need and deserve massive resettlement and reconstruction assistance, of which the pending measure provides at least a down payment. Our servicemen and women need and deserve the pay raise it provides and above all, those who are on the front lines in the Balkans and elsewhere in the world need supplies and equipment. However, in spite of these positive features, I will be voting ''no'' because of the bill's funding for an expanded, open-ended war against Yugoslavia, which in my opinion, has not been ade-quately and appropriately considered by the Congress, and also because this important legislation has been used for petty provincial interests. In effect, our servicemen and women are being held hostage while the bill has been loaded up with narrow amendments to assist special interests, such as a gold mine in Washington state, a dormitory for Congressional pages, and reindeer ranchers. While I have certainly observed this same game of special interest influence on the legislative process all too often since I have been in the Senate, this current case is particularly egregious VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5668 May 20, 1999 because of the boldness of the special interests and the apparent willingness of too many of our national leaders to allow those interests to be placed above consideration of the interests of our troops in the field. Our troops deserve better from all of us. I have spoken before my reservations about NATO's current policy in the Balkans and Congress' abdication of our Constitutional responsibilities with respect to war powers. To say the least, neither of those reservations have been alleviated in this conference report. Our leadership, including both the Clinton Administration and NATO, have failed to clearly state what our mission is in the Balkans, what specific goals we intend to achieve, and how we will end this mission. As perhaps the leading military ana- lyst of the Vietnam War, Colonel Harry Summers, wrote in his excellent book ''On Strategy: The Vietnam War in Contest:'' The first principle of war is the principle of ''The Objective.'' It is the first principle be-cause all else flows from it. . . . How to de-termine military objectives that will achieve or assist in achieving the political objectives of the United States is the primary task of the military strategist, thus the relationship between military and political objectives is critical. Prior to any future commitment of U.S. military forces our military leaders must insist that the civilian leadership pro-vide tangible, obtainable political goals. The political objective cannot merely be a plati-tude but must be stated in concrete terms. While such objectives may very well change during the course of the war, it is essential that we begin with an understanding of where we intend to go. As Clausewitz said, we should not ''take the first step without considering the last.'' In other words, we (and perhaps, more important, the American people) need to have a definition of ''vic-tory.'' Colonel Summers continues: There is an inherent contradiction between the military and its civilian leaders on this issue. For both domestic and international political purposes the civilian leaders want maximum flexibility and maneuverability and are hesitant to fix on firm objectives. The military on the other hand need just such a firm objective as early as possible in order to plan and conduct military oper-ations. Mr. President, we've been here be- fore, and speaking personally, I know all too well the kind of price that is paid by our men and women in uniform when our political leaders fail to lay out clear and specific objectives. More than thirty years ago, in Vietnam we also lacked clear and specific objec-tives. We attempted to use our mili-tary to impose our will in a region far from our shores and far from our vital national interests, and without ever fully engaging the Congress or the American people in the process. The re-sult was a conflict where the politi-cians failed to provide clear political objectives, but intruded in determining military strategy, and where our policy was never fully understood or fully supported by the American people. Too many Americans never came home from that war, and others came home unalterably changed in mind or body. I cannot in good conscience sit here and watch it all appear to be hap-pening again. I will not support putting American ground troops into Kosovo, and I cannot vote for this conference report which, in my opinion, moves us further in that direction. Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the conference re-port before us. It uses funds for undeni-ably urgent needs\u2014our operations in Kosovo, our rescue of struggling family farmers, our efforts to dig out from the hurricanes of last year and the tor-nados of this month\u2014to mask spending on unnecessary and unbudgeted urges. That is more than dishonest; it is dis-graceful. It is like agreeing to let your neighbors use your car to take their sick child to the hospital\u2014if they also agree to pick up and pay for your gro-ceries, your dry cleaning, a set of new tires for the car, and a pizza. It is no surprise that people are cyn- ical about talk that comes out of Washington. By adopting this con-ference report, we prove our work means very little. We prove that the budget we endorsed just two months ago was not a promise\u2014it was pos-turing. We prove that we are more in-terested in sound bites than sound ac-counting. Mr. President, I understand that there are genuine emergencies that re-quire us to spend beyond what we had anticipated for a given fiscal year. I will vote to fund such emergencies im-mediately and work out the budget de-tails later. I also understand that there are supplemental spending require-ments that can come up during the year. And I will also support passing supplemental appropriations bills and paying for them within the budget lim-its we have set for ourselves. What I find unconscionable is what we are doing here today: attempting to get around the draconian budget resolution we passed in March by stuffing as much supplemental spending as possible in this bill and then treating it as an emergency. Given my strong feelings on this, I would like to clarify my vote to waive the Gramm point of order. Senator G RAMM , rightly I believe, raised many of the same issues that concern me. His point of order, however, did a surgeon's job with a hatchet. His point of order would have brought down spending that was truly emergency, and there-fore was not offset\u2014spending for hu-manitarian aid for the Kosovar refu-gees, for infusions of cash into the struggling farm credit system, for help-ing areas hit by natural disaster. The point or order would also have brought down domestic spending that was not an emergency, but that the Appropria-tions Committee went to great pains to offset. There are over $2 billion in off-sets in this bill, and the great majority come from cuts in nondefense pro-grams. So, while I understand Senator G RAMM 's desire to make this bill fis- cally honest and responsible, I cannot support his methods. Instead, we should defeat this bill and start again\u2014 passing only what the Department of Defense says they need to continue their operations in Kosovo, only what is truly a domestic emergency, only what is non-emergency and offset. I have voted in support of the use of air power in Kosovo, a decision I made solemnly, and I am willing to vote to support funding the mission. This con-ference report, however, contains money the Pentagon never asked for and that will never have an impact on the situation in Kosovo. Almost five billion dollars in non-emergency de-fense spending has been attached to the President's request without even allow-ing the Senate an opportunity to vote or debate these additions. Calling some of these new military construction projects an ''emergency'' is shameful. Those projects cannot compare with the urgency in hurricane ravaged Cen-tral America, the economic hardship faced by our family farms, or the plight of refugees on the desolate hillsides of Albania. Obviously a great deal of munitions, fuel, and material have been expended in our mission over Yugoslavia. The need to fund these operations, however, should not be an excuse to fund other special-interest projects that were never high enough priorities to be placed in the tight military budget. Suddenly these projects are so impor-tant they are given emergency designa-tion, when a few months ago they hard-ly deserved mentioning, and were cer-tainly not worth including in the budg-et resolution Congress adopted in March. It is wrong for those who want a much larger defense budget to hold hostage the emergency funds needed for the Kosovo operation, Central America, and the devastated rural America\u2014and it is wrong to go to the American taxpayers to pay their ran-som. Thus, it is with some regret that I must vote against this conference re-port. Regret, because there are a num-ber of very good things in this bill, in- cluding funding that I worked hard to ensure would be there to help respond to the desperate situation of our family farmer. This bill provides $43 million for Farm Service Agency personnel and $110 million and for the farm credit program requested by the Administra-tion in response to the tremendous credit crunch facing our Nation's farm-ers. The Farm Service Agency funds are needed to provide the support staff so USDA can deliver disaster assist-ance promised to farmers last fall. The additional $110 million for USDA's farm credit program will provide essen-tial loan guarantees to farmers as they struggle through historically low prices. The conference report also includes $63 million for FY 1999 and FY 2000 to VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov \u2014 SENATE S5669 May 20, 1999 allow the USDA to provide technical assistance to landowners as they enroll in USDA's Natural Resource Conserva-tion Service environmental programs. Because of funding shortfalls, Wiscon-sin's NRCS has already stopped pro-viding technical assistance. That means thousands of acres of land, ready to be returned to their pristine state through the joint efforts of farm-ers and the USDA, are lying fallow. Finally, I want to highlight another provision I worked on in this con-ference report: food assistance to the Kosovar refugees. We have all seen the news accounts, the pictures, and have heard the terrible stories of tragedy that the people in the Balkans are fac-ing daily. Reports from that region in-clude hunger as another major problem that is hitting hardest among the chil-dren, the elderly, and the most vulner-able. Humanitarian food assistance, or PL-480 funds, have been diverted to Kosovo from other regions of the world where serious needs exist. Funding for Kosovo food assistance was not in-cluded in initial versions of this bill, but without it, people in Africa, Ban-gladesh, and other troubled regions will continue to suffer from hunger and deprivation. It is never good policy or sense to rob Peter to pay Paul, but it is disgraceful when Peter and Paul are in-nocent, starving children on opposite sides of the world. However, even with all these good things, this conference report is the harbinger of terrible things to come. By trying to slip so much non-emer-gency spending into this bill, the con-ference committee has acknowledged that we cannot meet the genuine needs of our citizens within the budget that was laid out in March. Mr. President, the American people deserve an honest budget, and they de-serve to know that we will meet their emergencies in a forthright manner. I regret that we could not do that today. If we pass this conference report, we will further and deservedly lose the trust of those who send us their hard earned tax dollars. I urge my col-leagues to vote no. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I will reluctantly vote for this supplemental appropriations bill for three primary reasons: to provide our agricultural producers at least a portion of the sup-port they need; to support our troops in Kosovo; and to assist the desperate Kosovar refugees and Hurricane Mitch victims. I strongly oppose the mining rider added in the middle of the night to this emergency spending bill and am saddened this Congress will not require States to spend of the tobacco settle-ment funds on actually preventing teen smoking or protecting public health. I very enthusiastically support the $109 million in this bill for direct and guaranteed loans to provide credit for American agricultural producers. This and the other agriculture-related pro-visions in this bill are vitally impor-tant to our growers, providing more than $700 million for important agri-cultural programs. Every single dollar of this aid is all the more critical be-cause Congress failed to support a funding level that would help producers weather these difficult economic times. I support the Harkin-Dorgan amend-ment to add $5 billion to this agricul-tural aid package during the con-ference committee's consideration of this bill. Unfortunately, the amend-ment was rejected. Meanwhile, our growers are left waiting for more meaningful assistance as they struggle under the so-called Freedom to Farm Act. This bill also contains vital funding for our military forces in the Balkans. I strongly support the Administra-tion's original request for monies to support the Kosovo effort. I am fully prepared to meet our responsibilities to our troops and personnel involved in this important NATO effort. It is un-fortunate the House insisted on adding billions of additional, unrequested funding for defense projects, many of which are unrelated to the NATO ac-tion in the Balkans. I also endorse our commitment to assist the millions of refugees, who are victims of this unfor-tunate conflict. I, too, am pleased this bill provide critical assistance to the victims of Hurricane Mitch. This deadly and de-structive hurricane decimated several Central American countries, and has been particularly difficult on families already surviving on subsistence levels. The U.S. should have long ago signaled our commitment to lead the inter-national effort to aid the victims of Hurricane Mitch. These important issues aside, I strongly oppose the rider on mining in-cluded in this bill. I do not accept the argument put forth by several of my colleagues on the conference com-mittee that the supplemental appro-priations bill was the proper place to address an administrative interpreta-tion of the 1872 Mining Law. Within this bill are two provisions that simply are not emergencies and do not belong. One is the further blockage of the De-partment of Interior's implementing regulations on hard-rock mining. The other provision is particularly troubling to me for it affects a pro-posed mine in my State of Washington. Included in this bill is a provision that blocks the Department of Interior from enforcing a recent solicitor's opinion interpreting allowable mill site acerage. That opinion reinterpreted the 1872 mining law and limited the amount of mining waste companies could dump on public lands. For many years, my constituents and people across the nation have been calling for true reform of the 1872 mining law. This late-night change is not what they have been asking us to do. The in-dustry knows these provisions would not win approval in the normal legisla-tive process, so they sought riders on a military and disaster relief appropria-tions bill. These are issues that deserve to be debated in full and in public, not in a mere 10 minutes, late at night among conferees without the necessary expertise to determine whether this is the correct policy. I want to add that I have spoken with officials at the White House who have shared their concern about these min-ing provisions. I told them we must not allow this action to be a precedent for how we authorize new open pit mines on our public lands. We should debate reform of the 1872 mining law fully and in the bright spotlight of public review. Protecting the public's interest in their federal lands must be a top pri-ority. They agree. I am also extremely disappointed this bill will allow the states to allocate the federal share of the multi-state agreement (MSA) with the tobacco companies to any program or project they desire. I strongly believe we have missed an historic opportunity to re-verse the destruction caused by smok-ing. It is tragic to think that every day we delay reducing underage smoking, 3,000 children will try this deadly habit. Five million children today will face illness and premature death due to smoking. Yet we are allowing the states to spend the federal share on any program they may chose. I am proud that in Washington state, the state legislature and Governor Locke chose to do the right thing and spend the settlement money working to eliminate the plague of tobacco. However, Washington state is only one of three states using the MSA settle-ment funds to support public health ef-forts and smoking cessation. There is some irony in this debate about the role of the federal govern-ment in spending so-called settlement monies. The tobacco companies win immunity from future prosecution or liability from the states of federal gov-ernment and because of states' inac-tion, the companies will be guaranteed a whole new generation of smokers. By not standing firm and using these mon-ies to eliminate underage smoking and reduce adult rates, the cost of care for these individuals will be the burden of the federal government and federal taxpayers. As members of the Senate, we will have to find the additional funding to pay for increases in Medi-care, FEHBP, CHAMPUS, and VA health care costs. I am disappointed that we could not reach an acceptable compromise that would have protected our children, al-lowed states' reasonable spending dis-cretion, and shielded the federal budg-et. I am hopeful we can continue to work at the federal level to enact tough, anti-tobacco restrictions, in-cluding FDA regulation of tobacco and increased efforts by CDC to help the states reduce the burden of tobacco. Let me address one more topic. This bill transfers the Disaster Recovery Initiative (DRI) program, commonly known as the unmet needs program, from HUD to FEMA. While I do not op-pose this transfer, my concerns about VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5670 May 20, 1999 it grew as Congress delayed its consid- eration of this supplemental bill. Presi-dent Clinton declared two disasters in Washington state during calendar year 1998, including a slow-moving, on-going landslide in the Aldercrest community in Kelso. For a variety of reasons, FEMA public assistance dollars will not reach Aldercrest victims for some time. That makes the unmet needs money\u2014now administered by FEMA\u2014 all the more critical. While I am frus-trated with the delay in this process, I am pleased we are moving forward once again. This conference report high-lights the conferees interest in ensur-ing Aldercrest victims get this disaster assistance as quickly as is possible. Mr. President, this is a very difficult vote for me. I chose not to sign the conference report, but I support the bill to help our ailing agricultural pro-ducers, support our troops, and provide assistance to refugees and disaster vic-tims. EFFECTIVE HUMAN RIGHTS RESPONSE TO KOSOVO Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, an im- portant provision in the Statement of the Managers on the 1999 Kosovo Emer-gency Supplemental Appropriations Act recommends $13 million above the administration's request for the Inter-national Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. It also rec-ommends $10 million more than the ad-ministration requested for the State Department's Human Rights and De-mocracy Fund. The conferees on this legislation have recommended these additional re-sources to help support a more effec-tive human rights response to the Kosovo crisis. Many of us are deeply concerned over the escalation of human rights abuses in Kosovo since the breakdown of the Rambouillet ne-gotiations. The additional funding for the War Crimes Tribunal will enable it to expand its investigative efforts to see that justice is done. Justice Arbour has made a strong case that this funding is needed imme-diately for forensic investigative teams, mass grave exhumations, inves-tigations, Albanian translators, equip-ment, and other associated costs. America is the strongest support of the War Crimes Tribunal, and it is essen-tial for us to provide provide the addi-tional resources the tribunal needs without delay to ensure that those re-sponsible for the gross violations of international law in Kosovo are brought to justice. I also strongly support the work of the State Department's Human Rights and Democracy Fund. The HRDF's ability to respond quickly to emer-gencies has enabled the Department to begin documenting mass executions, rape, deportations, and torture. Unfor-tunately, its resources are stretched thin as a result of the large scale of these atrocities. the additional funds recommended by Congress for the HRDF will enable the State Department to enhance its abil-ity to obtain information promptly and methodically from fleeing refugee vic-tims and witnesses and provide the in-formation to the U.S. Government, the War Crimes Tribunal, and the public to ensure that those responsible for these atrocities will be held accountable. The funds will also enable the State Department to provide documents to refugees whose passports, identity pa-pers, and property titles were stripped from them when Serb forces compelled them to leave Kosovo. Doing so will help counter President Milosevic's cyn-ical policy of ''identity cleansing'' and facilitate the return of the refugees to their homes. The funds are also in-tended to enhance our government's ef-forts to ensure that victims receive proper counseling for the unconscion-able trauma they have suffered. I commend the conferees for making these additional resources available to achieve an effective human rights re-sponse on Kosovo. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in 1996, I authored the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act to provide assistance to victims of terrorism and mass violence, wherever it occurred. This assistance is limited to victims who are citizens or employees of the United States who are injured or killed as a result of a ter-rorist act. Unfortunately, that legislation is not doing the job as we intended. There are still too many victims of terrorism who are not getting the help they need and deserve\u2014the help that Congress meant to give them in 1996. Among those left out in the cold are the fami-lies of those killed in the downing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988, and the victims of last year's em-bassy bombings in West Africa. Section 3024 of the emergency appro- priations bill will provide a limited but immediate response by providing much-needed assistance to the families of the Americans who were killed in the bombing of Pan Am 103. I am proud to have worked to get this emergency provision included in the conference re-port. Currently, in cases involving ter- rorist acts occurring outside the United States, the Office of Victims of Crime (OVC) may only give supple-mental grants to the States, for com-pensation of state residents. This for-mulation has not provided the intended help to victims of terrorism who reside overseas and do not have a clear State residence, even though they are U.S. citizens. It is of little assistance to the non-citizen victims employed by our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, who also deserve our support and assist-ance. And due to an overly restrictive interpretation of the 1996 law by the Department of Justice, it has not pro-vided help to the victims of the Lockerbie bombing and other victims of terrorist acts that occurred before the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act went into effect. The current law has led to slower im- plementation than I intended when emergency aid is desperately needed, and has not enabled OVC to provide emergency relief, crisis response or training and technical assistance for victim service providers, as I intended. Accordingly, this week I offered an amendment to the juvenile justice bill, S. 254\u2014which was accepted in the man-gers' amendment\u2014which would im-prove the law even further. It would ensure that OVC can provide efficient and effective assistance\u2014and really make a difference\u2014for Americans whose lives are torn apart by acts of terrorism and mass violence occurring outside the United States. In the meantime, the trial in the Pan Am 103 case is getting under way, and the families of those victims need our help now. This is an urgent matter, and I am glad that we are addressing it in this emergency bill. OUTSTANDING CLAIMS Mr. INOUYE. I have a few questions for my colleague from Alaska on Sec-tion 3021 of the bill which authorizes the Attorney General to transfer funds available to the Department of Justice to pay outstanding claims of Japanese Americans under the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 and outstanding claims of Japanese Latin Americans under the settlement agreement in the case of Carmen Mochizuki et al .v. United States (Case No. 97-294C, United States Court of Federal Claims). Am I correct that this provision would allow the Attorney General to pay redress of $20,000 to Japanese Americans who were interned by the United States during World War II and who filed a timely claim for redress under the Civil Liberties Act of 1988? Mr. STEVENS. That is correct. Under the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, the United States has paid redress to more than 82,000 eligible individuals over the 10 year life of the program. El-igible individuals under this Act had to file a claim for redress by August 10, 1998. There were a number of individ-uals, however, who did not complete the documentation necessary for the Department of Justice to determine, prior to the termination of the Civil Liberties Public Education Fund and the expiration of the redress program six months later, whether they were el-igible for redress under the Act. This provision would allow those individ-uals, if they filed timely claims, to pro-vide any necessary information to the Department of Justice, and allow the Department to complete its review of their files. If the Department deter-mines that they are eligible, this provi-sion allows the Attorney General to pay the claimants restitution under the Act. Mr. INOUYE. In the case of Carmen Mochizuki et al versus United States, plaintiffs brought a class action against the United States seeking re-dress for Japanese Latin Americans who were interned by the United States during World War II. The United States settled this case. The settle-ment provides that each eligible class VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5671 May 20, 1999 member would receive a $5,000 restitu- tion payment, to the extent there were funds available in the Civil Liberties Public Education Fund. Even though this Fund has now terminated, does this provision also allow the Attorney General to pay restitution to Japanese Latin American individuals who are found eligible under the Mochizuki set-tlement agreement and who filed time-ly claims covered by the agreement? Mr. STEVENS. That is correct. Some of the class members in this lawsuit were paid $5,000 restitution before the funds in the Civil Liberties Education Fund were exhausted. However, there are a number of class members who filed timely claims under the Mochizuki settlement who were not provided with restitution because there were no funds remaining. In addition, some class members were not able to complete the documentation necessary for the Department of Justice to deter-mine, prior to the termination of the Civil Liberties Public Education Fund and the expiration of the redress pro-gram six months later, whether they were eligible for redress under the set-tlement agreement. This provision would allow those individuals, if they filed timely claims, to provide any nec-essary information to the Department of Justice, and allow the Department to complete its review of their files. If the Department determines that they are eligible, or has already done so, this provision allows the Attorney General to pay them restitution under the settlement agreement. Mr. INOUYE. I thank my colleague from Alaska for the clarification on this provision in the bill. CLEANUP FROM SPRING TORNADOES Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleagues, Senator C OCHRAN and Senator K OHL, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Sub-committee on Agriculture, Rural De-velopment and Related Agencies, for their help regarding clean up needs in my state following the devastating tor-nadoes that struck on January 21, 1999. On that day, an estimated 38 tornadoes touched down in at least 16 counties in Arkansas, a one-day record for the number of tornadoes in a single state in one day. Eight deaths and scores of injuries resulted. The storms damaged or destroyed two thousand homes, at least 126 businesses, and various utili-ties in eleven counties. As you might imagine, a tremendous amount of de-bris is scattered throughout the dam-age area. When the Senate considered S. 544, the supplemental appropriations bill which is now before us as the con-ference report to H.R. 1141, an amend-ment of mine was adopted that would direct the Natural Resources Conserva-tion Service (NRCS) to assist in the re-moval of debris left from those storms. It is extremely important that we pro-vide assistance necessary to remove this debris in order to help restore lands to a more productive state, but even more importantly, to prevent more serious emergencies that will re-sult if this debris is allowed to obstruct stream flows and cause flooding, ero-sion, and other economic and environ-mental problems. Could the Senators please explain how his conference re-port addresses this situation. Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator for her comments and I understand her concern about the need to provide de-bris removal assistance following the violent storms in her state and other states. The amendment of the Senator, to which she refers, would have ex-panded the statutory authority of NRCS to exercise debris removal ac-tivities on lands not covered by current law. This would not only have included the lands of which the Senator speaks, but could be interpreted to cover a wide array of other lands. It is our un-derstanding that statutory authority does exist for the debris removal ac-tivities about which the Senator speaks, making bill language unneces-sary. However, certain administrative actions by the Department will be nec-essary before these activities can be carried out. From time to time, we are asked to provide emergency funds in response to natural disasters. Too often, there is a human cost to these disasters that we have no power to compensate. In other instances, the level of our assistance is appropriate and necessary for the task. There are times, however, when the sums required could have been reduced had a little prevention been in place before the crisis struck. Obviously, the force of a tornado is such that mankind may never be able to control or overcome. The devasta-tion we all have witnessed this Spring in several states including Arkansas, and more recently Oklahoma and Kan-sas, was of such a magnitude in eco-nomic and human costs that calls for our assistance must not go unheard. Now, however, we are faced with choices about actions that might, at this point, prevent future damage and future costs. The debris of which the Senator de- scribes is not only that which cur-rently is obstructing stream flows or causing flooding or erosion, but it also includes debris located in the imme-diate vicinity of those streams and wa-terways. It takes little imagination to envision another, far less intensive storm in the region that would cause that debris to be removed directly into the steambed with substantial damage and cost as a result, costs for which we and the American taxpayers might very well be asked to compensate in the near future. in this case, a little prevention today may save substantial sums tomorrow. That is why the Sen-ator is precisely correct and why we must ensure these needs are met. The conference report now before the Senate does not include the bill lan-guage the Senator offered earlier due to the fact that, as mentioned above, the statutory authority for those ac-tivities of concern to her and to others currently exists. The Statement of Managers makes that point. However, the purpose of her amendment is well taken in bringing to the attention of the Department that necessary admin-istrative actions must be taken imme-diately to address the emergency situa-tion that remains. We do not here sug-gest that the Watershed and Flood Pre-vention Operations authorities be broadened to include ''any'' lands. In-stead, it is important for us all to rec-ognize that reasonable steps by the De-partment should be taken to remove the debris in question before it be-comes the cause of more substantial losses in the future. Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator from Arkansas for raising this issue and I appreciate the comments of my other colleagues on this subject. I agree with the Senator from Wisconsin that the Department should exercise any preventive measures practicable as the best way to avoid more costly res-toration and rehabilitation in the fu-ture. Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank my col- leagues for this explanation. Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the 1999 Supplemental Appro-priations legislation. Let me make a few brief remarks explaining why I will vote against it. I do so reluctantly be-cause some of this funding is nec-essary, such as the agriculture spend-ing, and some is offset. I co-sponsored and strongly supported the Enzi amendment to fully offset spending in this bill. Since our colleagues on the other side of the aisle blocked this ef-fort to be fiscally responsible, thereby giving their support to this spending of Social Security surplus funds, I cannot endorse this irresponsible spending. The Concord Coalition, a bipartisan watchdog of fiscal policy, calls this bill a ''SAYGO'' bill, and SAYGO stands for spend-as-you-go. According to the Con-cord Coalition, ''Congress is using the emergency spending loophole to create a new budgetary concept\u2014spend as you go (SAYGO). I fully agree with the Concord Coalition. Sadly, the term ''SAYGO'' has captured the essence of this legislation. However, there is nothing new about this practice. Congress has repeatedly used this old trick on the American taxpayers as a way to expand govern-ment programs and escape budget dis-ciplines. Let me remind my colleagues about what happened last year. As you recall, Mr. President, despite the rhetoric of President Clinton and Congress to use every penny of the budget surplus to save Social Security, last year, we spent nearly $30 billion of the Social Security surplus for alleged ''emergency spending.'' This was more than one third of the entire Social Se-curity surplus for 1998. In last year's omnibus spending legislation alone, Congress spent $22 billion, and nearly $9.3 billion in regular appropriations was shifted into future budgets, a new VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, SENATE S5672 May 20, 1999 smoke-and-mirrors gimmick, since we are now hearing how impossible it will be to live within budget caps for FY 2000. No wonder! In addition, few of these ''emergency spending'' items were true emer-gencies. Many of these dollars could have been included in the annual ap-propriations process. Last year's irresponsible spending used up the Social Security surplus we were supposed to save, broke the statu-tory spending caps we promised to keep, and as a result made the caps even tighter for this year. Clearly, that was a big mistake. That's why many of us believe we should end this practice before it be-comes automatic and even more egre-gious in the future. In fact, that's why we passed this year's Budget Resolu-tion with a new enforcement mecha-nism which allows any Senator to raise a point of order against non-defense emergency designations in an appro-priations conference report. In my judgment, this should include defense as well. Unfortunately, Mr. President, we are repeating the same mistake in the 1999 Supplemental Appropriations bill. It includes $15 billion of spending with an estimate of only $2.5 billion actually outlayed this fiscal year. So it is quite obvious this spending is a way to re-lieve some of the pressure on the FY 2000 spending caps. If the spending caps need to be lifted, let's vote on that up front, not this way. I would not vote to lift the caps anyway, but it is a more responsible way of handling what some believe is a budget crisis. The legislation was originally in- tended to provide disaster relief to Central America and was later ex-panded to cover our military action in Kosovo, which are necessary and im-portant spending. Even the agriculture spending is necessary. But conferees also added significant funding that is not emergency-related and was not re-quested by the President in the con-ference report. The conference report for this year's emergency spending bill includes $15 billion with only $1.9 billion offset. This means Congress is spending $13 billion of the Social Security surplus, which is over 10 percent of this year's Social Security surplus. The President requested $5.5 billion for military operations in Kosovo and Southwest Asia. But the conferees have doubled that amount. As a result, American taxpayers now have to pay $10.9 billion additional for defense, much of which should be considered in FY 2000 appropriations and was not an emergency. These add-ons include $1.84 billion for military pay and pension in-creases and $2.25 billion for spare parts, depot maintenance and readiness train-ing. I believe we must allocate sufficient resources to ensure our national secu-rity and I am concerned about readi-ness. We must provide adequate fund-ing to maintain our military oper-ations and support our troops in Kosovo and elsewhere. However, I don't believe we can use our immediate needs as a vehicle for non-emergency defense spending. General defense read-iness needs, such as a military pay raise and a pension benefits increase, is not an emergency and should be han-dled through the normal budget, au-thorization and appropriations process. Again, if the spending cap is a problem, we should deal with that problem head on, not by this back-door approach. Further, this conference report is a Christmas tree that's loaded not with ornaments, but with plenty of non- emergency spending items under the guise of an emergency, totaling over $200 million. Even some emergency re-lated funding is far above what is need-ed and requested. For example, the President requested $370 million fund-ing for FEMA, but the conference re-port has almost tripled that amount. This is not right. Attached is a copy of Senator M CCAIN's list on the objection- able provisions contained in this con-ference report. My biggest concern is that we have promised the American people we will save every penny of the Social Security surplus exclusively for Social Security. In the recently-passed budget resolu-tion we included a provision to lock in $1.8 trillion of the Social Security sur-plus to save and strengthen Social Se-curity. We are continuing to pursue So-cial Security lockbox legislation to prohibit Washington from continuing to loot the Social Security surplus for unrelated government spending. Now we are backing off from that promise, claiming we will make it up next year. I've heard that before. I believe this will damage our credibility and ac-countability with the American people, as well as further endanger our already damaged Social Security system. As I mentioned earlier, there are some good provisions I strongly sup-port in this bill. Frankly, some of the provisions and funding will help my own state of Minnesota. But the non- emergency spending which is not offset overshadows these good provisions. I cannot in good conscience vote for this legislation. Finally, the Concord Coalition chal- lenges us, I quote: ''Fiscally respon-sible Members of both parties should put an end to SAY-GO by rejecting this emergency supplemental.'' They are right. Above all we must maintain the fiscal discipline and responsibility we promised the American people. We must keep our commitment to protect Social Security. I hope my colleagues will reject this measure. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent this list of objectionable provi-sions in H.R. 1141 be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the mate- rial was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: OBJECTIONABLE PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN H.R. 1141, THE EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS AND RESCISSIONS FOR RE- COVERY FROM NATURAL DISASTERS AND FOREIGN ASSISTANCE FOR FISCAL YEAREND- INGSEPTEMBER 30, 1999 BILL LANGUAGE Bill language directing that funds made last year for maple producers be made avail-able for stream bank restorations.

(Unrequested) Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, this marks the third time I have been to the floor to discuss the emergency sup- plemental bill. For months now I have been trying to get my colleagues' at-tention about the extreme urgency of the items included in this bill. There are provisions included in this bill that were deemed an ''emergency'' back in March of this year. In addition to the tornado-related funding we just ref-erenced, I have received call after call from farmers who have been anxiously awaiting the loan money that is tied up in this supplemental appropriations bill. Mother Nature does not wait for Congress to act. The ideal planting window has already come and gone for several commodities in the South, and yet, many producers have not been able to put a crop in the ground because they do not have adequate funds for op-erating expenses. The money is in-cluded in this bill and it is critical that we act on this matter as quickly as possible. While I am pleased that these funds are included, I am disappointed that more assistance is not provided to the agriculture community. If ever there was an emergency in this country, we are seeing one now in rural America. I commend the distinguished ranking member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator H ARKIN , on his ef- forts to provide additional assistance to farmers. I hope that my colleagues will be ever mindful of the potential consequences this country will face if we allow our producers to simply die on the vine, and I strongly urge this body to revisit the agricultural crisis as soon as possible. Some of my colleagues have chosen to use this bill, which is designed spe-cifically for emergency needs, to fund projects that would have a hard time passing the laugh test of emergency spending. In spite of this, I will be cast-ing a vote in favor of this bill on behalf of the brave servicemen and women representing our nation in the conflict in Kosovo, and on behalf of our na-tion's family farmers. I thank the President, and I yield the floor. EMERGENCY COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT FUNDING Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise re- garding the conference report language in the supplemental bill regarding the transfer of emergency Community De-velopment Block Grant funding from HUD to FEMA. January 1998 will long be remem- bered in the State of Maine because of the extraordinary and historic Ice Storm that crippled the State. The combination of heavy rains and freez-ing temperatures left much of the State under a thick coat of ice which downed wires, toppled transformers and snapped utility poles in two. At the peak of the storm more than 80 per-cent of the entire State was literally in the dark. Vice President G ORE best summed up the situation during his visit on January 15, 1998, when he said, VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, SENATE S5674 May 20, 1999 ''We've never seen anything like this. This is like a neutron bomb aimed at the power system.'' The response from the federal gov- ernment to our plight was for the most part remarkable. The Federal Emer-gency Management Agency (FEMA), the Small Business Administration, and the Department of Defense all an-swered Maine's call for immediate help. In addition, utility workers from up and down the East Coast came to work in freezing temperatures and haz-ardous situations to kill live wires and free remaining wires from downed trees and poles. These men and women worked side by side with Maine's util-ity companies around the clock until the lights were back on in every house in the State. I am here today, however, because while the storm brought out the best in people across the State and in many federal agencies, we still have not re-ceived the assistance we need from the Department of Housing and Urban De-velopment. In fact the lack of help from HUD has surpassed the storm in many people's minds as the truly ex-traordinary event. To understand fully, one has to know the history. The Stafford Act which provides FEMA's guidelines for assist-ance covers public power companies. It will reimburse 75 percent of the costs related to a disaster. Because Maine and much of the Northeast have utili-ties that are investor-owned rather than government-owned, we were ineli-gible to receive assistance from FEMA for this purpose, despite the fact that, FEMA's own Ice Storm ''Blueprint for Action'' noted that the greatest unmet need from the storm is the cost of util-ity infrastructure. The ''Blueprint'' also noted that ''(The) HUD Commu-nity Development Block Grant Pro-gram can supplement other federal as-sistance in repairing and recon-structing infrastructure, including pri-vately-owned utilities . . .'' Utility reimbursement is of great concern to Maine as it was not only the largest unmet need from the Ice Storm, but ratepayers in our State already pay the fourth highest utility costs in the country. Without some federal help, ratepayers would have been called on to cover utility infrastructure re-pair costs through increased rates. So the Maine Congressional Delega- tion joined with the delegations from Vermont, New Hampshire and New York to obtain funding in the 1998 Sup-plemental Appropriations Act to pro-vide money for the CDBG program to help our States complete their recov-ery from the Ice Storm. Working with Senator B OND, Chairman of the VA/ HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator M IKULSKI the Ranking Mem- ber; and Appropriations Chairman S TE- VENS , we secured $260 million in the Senate's 1998 Supplemental. When the Senate considered this leg- islation, members from the Northeast spoke of the need for, and reasons be-hind, this additional funding and in a colloquy between Senators B OND and D'AMATO , it was noted that $60 million of this funding was meant specifically for the Northeast to help with the re-covery costs from the Ice Storm. Dur-ing the subsequent conference, that amount was dropped to $130 million, as the House version of the bill only con-tained $20 million for this purpose. The Supplemental was signed into law on May 1, 1998. On November 6, 1998, 11 months after the disaster and six months after the bill had been signed into law, HUD announced that it was allocating approximately half of the $130 million, including $2.2 million for Maine. With an unmet need of more than $70 million, this funding was sim-ply unacceptable and made all the more so because HUD would not or could not explain the rationale behind the numbers. Phone calls were made, meetings were held, letters were sent and still we received no explanation. In the 1999 Omnibus Appropriations bill adopted by Congress at the end of the 105th Congress, $250 million was provided for emergency CDBG money to cover disasters occurring in both FY98 and FY99. Secretary Cuomo told me in a phone conversation on March 2, 1999 that he would use some of this money to allow States dissatisfied with their original allocation to reapply. This discussion occurred a few days be-fore the Senate Appropriations Com-mittee marked up the 1999 Supple-mental that included language to transfer the remaining CDBG emer-gency funding from HUD to FEMA be-cause, according to the Senate Appro-priations Committee report, The Committee is concerned over HUD's continuing failure to implement an effective emergency disaster relief program for the ''unmet needs'' of states with Presidentially- declared natural disasters. Instead, the Com-mittee believes that FEMA is the appro-priate Federal agency for addressing these unmet disaster needs since FEMA has pri-mary responsibility for assessing and re-sponding to all natural disasters and for ad-ministering most primary programs of dis-aster assistance. In particular, FEMA is urged to review and respond appropriately to the needs of the Northeast for damage resulting from the ice storms of last winter. HUD failed to respond properly to these needs despite congressional concern over the ice damage. On March 5, 1999 I spoke again with Secretary Cuomo when he called to ex-press his concern that he could not publish the notice as OMB said that the Senate Appropriations Commit-tee's actions on March 4 to transfer the money from HUD to FEMA prevented him from doing so. After conversations with OMB, I sent a letter to the Sec-retary detailing OMB'S response that it was permissible to publish the notice as long as funding was not allocated. On March 10, the Federal Register (p. 11943 to p. 11945) contained a notice from HUD that provided a review for states unhappy with their original funding allocation. Maine began work at once on an application for this fund-ing. On March 23, we learned that HUD had allocated the rest of the money from the 1998 supplemental and that Maine was slated to receive another $2.158 million. HUD took this action de-spite the fact that they had been in-formed by the VA/HUD Subcommittee Chair and Ranking member, Senators B OND and M IKULSKI respectively, that they ''wait for final action by the Con-gress on the program structure for the award of emergency funding for ''unmet'' disaster needs'' and that ''be-cause of a number of outstanding pro-gram issues, we believe that HUD should ''hold'' all final award alloca-tions pending final congressional ac-tion on S. 544.'' So HUD's allocation announcement was somewhat con-fusing as they did not have the author-ity to release the money. I request unanimous consent that a copy of the HUD notice be included in the R ECORD . Secretary Cuomo told me on March 24 that the State should get their ap-plication in response to the March 10 Federal Register in as soon as possible, and the State delivered it to HUD on March 25. On May 4, as conferees were working on the Supplemental, I received a let-ter from Cardell Cooper, Assistant HUD Secretary for Community Plan-ning and Development, announcing that Maine would receive an additional $17,088,475 based on the State's March 25 application under the March 10 Fed-eral Register notice. This letter also noted that Maine's money was subject to Congressional action. Mr. President, mere words cannot ex- plain the frustration that Mainers have experienced with HUD throughout this process. I am deeply grateful for the leadership that Senator B OND, Senator MIKULSKI , Chairman S TEVENS and the entire Senate Appropriations Com-mittee have demonstrated in their willingness to work with us and to help us address Maine's unmet needs. The conference report language on this bill states that: The Department is directed to award the remaining funds in accordance with an-nouncements made heretofore by the Sec-retary, including allocations made pursuant to the March 10, 1999 notice published in the Federal Register, as expeditiously as pos-sible. This language directs HUD to live up to its March and May promises of fund-ing for Maine to help pay for the unmet needs of the Ice Storm. Mr President, with passage of the Supplemental, Maine's fifteen month journey for equity will hopefully end. We can now complete the recovery that began in January, 1998 and has dragged on far too long. Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to comment today on the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Pro-gram which my distinguished colleague from West Virginia, Senator B YRD, worked so hard to have included in the Senate-passed Emergency Supple-mental Appropriations bill. Despite his tireless efforts, the measure was stripped from the bill at the eleventh hour for reasons which are beyond me. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, SENATE S5675 May 20, 1999 I take umbrage with the misleading moniker that some Members of the House Leadership have shamelessly placed upon this vital program for par-tisan political purposes. This program, far from being a hand- out for any one company in my state of West Virginia or anywhere else, would provide emergency relief for more than a dozen American steel producers who have been stricken by the effects of the unprecedented surge in steel imports into the U.S. over the last year. This crisis, which has caused as many as 10,000 layoffs at steel factories across the nation and threatens as many as 100,000 more jobs, has unfairly injured the credit ratings of America's steel manufacturers by forcing them to com-pete with dirt cheap foreign steel, which is often being sold in the U.S. at costs below that of production. If you ask me, this important crisis, without question, is appropriately clas-sified as an ''emergency''. If you ask the steelworkers who've either been laid off or who are the next to go, I bet they say the same thing. Ask their families and communities if this is an emergency, and you'll get the same an-swer. The emergency is that our Amer-ican steel industry is being pummeled by illegal foreign competition, and that the imports are taking a very real and devastating toll on the people who depend on steel for their livelihood. The program that Senator B YRDpro- posed in the Senate-passed version of the Supplemental Appropriations bill would have made it possible for many of the most financially-unstable steel producers in this country to persevere until we in the Senate can take deci-sive and comprehensive action to ad-dress the underlying cause of our do-mestic steel industry's current predica-ment\u2014imports. The Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program would have made much-needed capital available to those companies who have been the hardest hit by the import surge, and it would have done so at minimal expense to the American taxpayer. The pro-gram just made good sense, and I was extremely disappointed to hear that Members of the House Leadership in-sisted that it be eliminated. The argument was, from what I hear, that Senator B YRD's provision was too expensive and of benefit only to Weirton Steel Corporation in West Vir-ginia. The fact is, Mr. President, that Weirton was just one of more than a dozen companies which the Depart-ment of Commerce determined would be eligible for loans under this pro-gram. All of these distressed companies have been doing everything in their power to survive the current crisis. I know first hand the great lengths to which Weirton Steel has gone through simply to keep its head above water. In my state alone we've had nearly 1,000 layoffs as a direct result of the import surge. The Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program would have made it possible for companies across the na-tion to make upcoming debt payments which many steel producers are in jeopardy of defaulting on because of the current crisis. Moreover, the cost of the program was $140 million to le-verage $1 billion in loans\u2014that's a good investment. I deeply regret that the unwillingness of some Members of Con-gress to open their eyes to the plight of America's steelworkers has resulted in the loan program being removed from this vehicle. That is very bad news for the many steel companies who stood to benefit from the program. Some of them are now that much closer to join-ing the other four major American steel producers who have already been forced into bankruptcy by this crisis. However, there remains time to re- verse this mistake. I hope that the Members of Congress, who did not un-derstand the details of how this loan program functions or the benefits that it would bestow upon a large number of steel companies across the nation, will reassess their position. We still have an opportunity to support this important program. I intend to work with Sen-ator B YRD in moving this program on another legislative vehicle. Each of my colleagues knows how strongly I believe that this body must act to address the import surge in a comprehensive way. However, I also know how vital the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program is to many U.S. steel producers. It is a critically important stop-gap measure which would allow companies like Weirton steel to remain in business long enough for the United States Senate to take the tough and comprehensive action which is necessary to protect our do-mestic industry from unfair foreign competition. Mr. President, I truly hope that we seize the opportunity to take up this measure again. Without it, steel com-panies in a number of different states may soon find themselves the next vic-tims of our failure to aggressively en-force our unfair trade laws. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I do not support the adoption of the con-ference report on H.R. 1141, the fiscal year 1999 emergency appropriations act. My decision to oppose this bill was not an easy one, Mr. President. This legislation contains funding for our U.S. military forces in Kosovo, Iraq, Bosnia, and elsewhere around the world. Regardless of my deep concerns about NATO's Kosovo operations, I re-alize that our military, already stretched to the limit by numerous for-eign deployments, needs the resources provided by this legislation. Further, this bill contains funding to help farm-ers in Oklahoma who are finding it hard to get credit, and it will make sure disaster assistance for Oklahoma tornadoes does not deplete FEMA's funding reserves. Unfortunately, it is also fiscally irre- sponsible. H.R. 1141 provides $15 billion in new spending authority, $13 billion of which is provided for fiscal year 1999 and $2 billion of which is provided for fiscal year 2000. The outlays flowing from this budget authority will reduce our budget sur-plus by $14.6 billion over the next five years. In fiscal year 1999 and 2000, when the entire budget surplus is attrib-utable to the Social Security trust fund, this bill spends $11 billion of the surplus. Additionally, $14.7 billion of the bill's total spending is designated as emer-gency spending, so that it is outside of the spending caps. $10.9 billion of the emergency spending is attributable to defense. Unfortunately, the efforts of my col- league Senator G RAMM to remove the nondefense emergency designations failed earlier today. I supported him in that effort, and I am disappointed that more of my colleagues did not join us. This legislation makes a mockery of our budget process. I believe Congress cannot continue to squander the econo-my's good fortune on a bigger, more invasive government. I believe the fis-cal restraints we all agreed to in 1997 should be enforced, and I believe the budget we passed just a few weeks ago must be complied with. A soaring economy and the 1997 budg- et agreement combined last year to produce the first budget surplus since 1969. What was Congress' reaction? We abandoned all fiscal restraint and passed a monstrous Omnibus spending bill which included a record $22 billion in emergency spending. With CBO predicting an even bigger budget surplus this year, $111 billion, we are rushing to enact a $15 billion emergency spending bill. Since spending caps were instituted in the 1990 budget deal, Congress has appropriated $132 billion in emergency spending; $70 billion since the end of the Gulf War. The average annual emergency appropriation from 1993 to 1997 was $8 billion. I believe that Senators must decide if they truly intend to abide by the budg-ets we pass, or simply ignore them. As I have already mentioned, this bill includes $1.13 billion in new spending for the Federal Emergency Manage-ment Agency, partially offset by a $230 million transfer from the Community Development Block Grant program. This $1.13 billion is in addition to the $1.2 billion Congress has already appro-priated to FEMA for fiscal year 1999. While I support the work FEMA is doing to help my state recover from massive tornado damage, I believe the funding in this supplemental is far more than the agency needs. In fact, after touring Oklahoma tornado dam-age two weeks ago, the President asked for an additional $372 million for FEMA. I have been assured by FEMA that they do not require resources be-yond this request to accommodate the Oklahoma disasters. Unfortunately, the conferees on the supplemental decided to pile on $758 million more than the President re-quested. This extra funding has noth-ing to do with FEMA's current needs. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov \u2014 SENATE S5676 May 20, 1999 It has everything to do with the appro- priations committee's desire to ''pre- fund'' the agency in an attempt to avoid the fiscal year 2000 spending caps. Mr. President, I commend the major- ity leader for his efforts to keep the cost of this bill down and remove some of its objectionable provisions. How-ever, I deeply regret that I cannot sup-port this emergency supplemental spending bill. I believe we are losing our grip on fiscal sanity, and I fear that worse is coming later this year. I plan to work aggressively throughout this year to make sure we comply with the budget we enacted last month. Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of the supplemental appropria-tions conference report. Mr. President, this bill is not perfect, and I realize that some of my col-leagues do not believe it is worthy of support. I disagree. This legislation meets several pressing demands that we have a responsibility to meet. First, this compromise provides essential funding for our military operations in Yugoslavia as well as humanitarian aid for Kosovo refugees. Without this fund-ing our fighting men and women will face equipment and material shortfalls and view a ''no'' vote as a lack of sup-port for them and their mission. Sec-ond, this legislation follows through on a commitment we made to provide a long-overdue pay raise for our troops. Third, this legislation provides disaster assistance to help our Latin American neighbors recover from the hurricane which struck that region so viciously earlier this year, and it contains funds to aid recovery from the recent spate of tornadoes here at home. Lastly, it extends the Airport Improvement Pro-gram which helps our nation's airports reduce aircraft noise and ensure avia-tion safety. However, I am disappointed that the Conference Committee decided to re-tain the Hutchison-Graham tobacco settlement recoupment provision in this year's Supplemental Appropria-tions bill. This amendment clearly does not deal with an ''emergency'' sit-uation and should, therefore, not be in-cluded in this legislation. I am also deeply concerned that we have not thoroughly considered the potential impact this provision will have on the federal budget in years to come. In essence, this provision usurps the ability of the Congress to engage in a healthy debate about the use of the federal share of the tobacco settle-ment. While many argue that the fed-eral government has absolutely no claim to this money, those assertions simply are not true. Current law dic-tates that the federal government rightly has a say over the percentage it contributes to the Medicaid program. Yet, instead of bringing this matter to the floor and considering it in an hon-est fashion, we are allowing an unprec-edented opportunity to make a real dif-ference in the lives of millions of Americans completely slip away from us. It is unfortunate that proponents of turning over the federal share of the tobacco settlement to the states with-out any guidelines have taken this backdoor approach. In essence, we have allowed our hands to be tied by the states, who wish to use this money to cut taxes, fix roads and build new buildings, among other things. According to a recent survey conducted by the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, the majority of states, as of today, have no definite plans to spend a portion of the settle-ment on programs to prevent children from starting to smoke or to help cur-rent smokers quit the habit. This ac-tion is in direct contrast with the de-sires of the majority of Americans who would like to see a major portion of this money set aside for tobacco pre-vention and cessation programs and health care to cover the cost of tobacco related illness. In my state, Rhode Is-landers have resoundingly supported dedicating a significant amount of the settlement for tobacco related activi-ties. I am saddened that we appear to have lost sight of the fact that the process of suing the tobacco companies was not so states could get more money for roads or schools, but because for dec-ades these companies purposefully de-ceived the American public about the dangers of smoking. As a result, gen-erations of Americans have suffered the adverse health effects of this cam-paign of deceit, and the federal govern-ment spent billions addressing the health care needs of these folks. While states were triumphant in reaching this monumental agreement, what will the effort have been for if there is no change in teen smoking rates in this country? Lastly, I am concerned that the con- ference report contains a number of du-bious environmental riders that should be more fully debated as well as several budgetary off-sets that raise a number of questions. In particular, as a Sen-ator who serves on the Banking, Hous-ing, and Urban Affairs Committee, I be-lieve that the rescission of $350 million worth of Section 8 funds could jeop-ardize the renewal of affordable hous-ing contracts for thousands of elderly and low-income Americans, which would be a step backwards in our effort to increase the amount of affordable housing in our nation. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I regret that I have to come to the floor to cast my vote against the emergency supple-mental appropriations bill before the Senate today. When we face crises in this country, when you have American men and women serving courageously in Kosovo, when you have the borders in Macedonia and Montenegro over-flowing with refugees, and when you have hundreds of thousands of hurri-cane victims in Central America, you would expect that the U.S. Senate would be capable of coming together\u2014 unanimously\u2014to address these chal-lenges. It used to be that way in the Senate. It's not that way anymore. Now we fund our operations in Kosovo, and we help the refugees, and we aid the hurricane victims, but at the same time we practice legislative extor-tion\u2014we say to every Senator, ''You want to vote for Kosovo? You want to vote for aid for hurricane victims? Go ahead\u2014but you have to vote to cut vital housing programs for working Americans across this country. And you need to vote to eliminate environ-mental regulations.'' That's not the way we ought to do business in the U.S. Senate, and I think it's time we start to talk about changing that course be-fore it contaminates public life any further. That is why I will cast my vote against this emergency supplemental appropriations bill: to register my frus-tration and my sadness with the way we now do business in the U.S. Senate. Before I say more about the damage this bill does to so many of the vital areas of public policy in the United States, I must tell you that in many respects I only have the liberty of vot-ing against this bill\u2014of casting a sym-bolic stone against legislative black-mail\u2014because I know this bill will pass the Senate overwhelmingly. Critical investments for our troops in Kosovo\u2014 which, as a veteran, as a citizen, and as a senator, I have aggressively sup-ported\u2014will be made in spite of my vote against this bill. The truth is, if this were not the case, if my vote would have undermined in any respects our efforts in Kosovo, I would have had to vote for this bill, in spite of the damage it does. I would have had to\u2014 regrettably\u2014support this bill because we have a responsibility to support the American troops we have committed overseas, and I would never stand by and allow the Senate to send what I be-lieve is the wrong message to our troops, and the wrong message to Slobodan Milosevic about American re-solve . I believe the United States, and NATO as a whole, must remain united against the systematic killing, raping and pillaging of innocent Kosovar Al-banian men, women, and children at the hands of Serb forces. The funding included in this supplemental appro-priations conference report will pro-vide support for the U.S. service men and women who are putting their lives in jeopardy and will, I believe, give them a greater capacity to achieve our military objectives in Kosovo. It will also provide the desperately needed re-lief for humanitarian efforts already underway to assist the refugees in that region. And these investments will be made by the U.S. Senate, reflected in our final tally. I believe this Nation must have a bi- partisan foreign policy, and that we can not afford to allow politics to en-danger our troops. But I wish that more of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, those who included provisions which cut directly against the interests of low income working Americans and our environment, would VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5677 May 20, 1999 also have a commitment to bipartisan- ship on domestic issues of tremendous importance to so many working Ameri-cans struggling to keep their heads above water even in this great econ-omy we celebrate on the floor of the U.S. Senate. The rescissions and changes in policy included in this Con-ference Report will eventually hurt the poorest Americans and will imme-diately hurt our environment. That should not be acceptable in a Senate which prides itself on its ability to do what is right for all Americans. I can not in good conscience support these measures. I question what it says about our commitment to helping those who are being left behind in this new economy, that we could find the resources to pro-vide $983 million in disaster relief for those whose lives were disrupted when Hurricane Mitch struck the Central American nations of Honduras, Nica-ragua, El Salvador and Guatemala and when Hurricane Georges struck in the Caribbean last year\u2014but we are cut-ting critical investments in housing for working Americans. Hurricanes in Cen-tral America have left almost 10,000 dead and have driven millions from their homes. The cost of damages to businesses, hospitals, schools and indi-vidual homes have been enormous. We are right to provide assistance to the victims of these hurricanes. But we ought to be able to do it without aban-doning thousands of our neediest citi-zens here at home. Today there are more than five mil- lion low-income Americans facing se-vere housing needs, receiving federal housing assistance. At least another 15 million Americans qualify for help but do not receive it because of limited budget appropriations. They suffer from homelessness\u2014600,000 Americans homeless each night; 5.3 million Ameri-cans pay rents that are more than 50 percent of their household income, or live in severely substandard condi-tions\u2014these are the severe housing problems we once hoped to address. These families are one misfortune away from homelessness. A child gets sick, a parent gets laid off\u2014even for a week or two, the car breaks down, and that family ends up on the streets. So what are we doing in this supplemental appropriations bill? We're rescinding $350 million from the Section 8 pro-gram that helps these families who are working through the tough times\u2014and we're rescinding this money in spite of the fact that the HUD budget in FY1999 will already be almost $1 billion less than it was in FY1994. This rescission will result in a shortfall that will cause the loss of subsidy and the displace-ment of approximately 60,000 families. 60,000 families. It will make the current waiting list crisis, where families must sometimes wait years to find some re-lief, even more difficult to solve. This isn't the first time this has hap- pened. Year after year, HUD's budget is raided\u2014targeted for cuts in 1995, in 1997, in 1998, and again this year\u2014to pay for emergencies which, by their na- ture and by law, are not required to be offset with budget cuts. Only a very small portion of this $15 billion bill is offset with spending cuts. I am dis-turbed, really, that some of my col-leagues have chosen to make cuts to this program because they believe it is politically vulnerable. HUD's budget should not fall victim to this type of spending cut\u2014and families struggling to stay off the streets shouldn't fall victim to this kind of politics. I am not new to this game. I have fought year in and year out against substantial cuts that have been made to the HUD budget. These cuts have jeopardized the existing public housing services and have undermined HUD's capacity to continue the Secretary's ambitious program of reform or even just to make up for previous under- funding of capital needs to meet our Nation's demand for affordable hous-ing. Last year, the Congress passed the first new section 8 vouchers in 5 years. This rescission would reverse in large part the down payment Congress made in addressing unmet housing needs. At least 100,000 new vouchers are needed to begin to address the outstanding needs. This rescission moves us in the wrong direction. As the ranking member of the Hous- ing Subcommittee, as someone who sees first hand in Massachusetts the struggles of so many families working their fingers to the bone and trying to stay off the streets, I can not support these draconian cuts in housing. But this bill doesn't stop there. Some of my colleagues have included dan-gerous environmental riders in this bill\u2014in a practice that is becoming all too common in this Senate. It wasn't this way 15 years ago when I came here, it wasn't that way 30 years ago when Democrats and Republicans worked together to write our first envi-ronmental laws, but it's that way now\u2014even basic environmental protec-tions have become a partisan fight\u2014 and the riders in this bill do serious damage to our environment. Specifi-cally, the conference report includes three environmental riders that I be-lieve will set back environmental progress, unnecessarily limit federal revenues and undermine the legislative process\u2014and I oppose all of them. The conference report extends the moratorium on issuing a final rule- making on crude oil valuation until October 1, 1999. It restricts the imple-mentation of the Department of the In-terior Solicitor's opinion on mining that limits the number of millsites to one five-acre millsite per patent. The environmental rider that I find most egregious prevents the Depart-ment of Interior from issuing new rules for hardrock mining on public lands. This is the third time the Senate has attached such a provision to an appro-priations bill. As a result, the hardrock mining industry continues to cause en-vironmental damage and costs the tax-payer. The extraction of hardrock minerals like gold, silver and copper usually in-cludes the excavation of enormous pits and the use of toxic chemicals like cya-nide, and its results have been destruc-tive. According to the General Ac-counting Office, there are almost 300,000 acres of federal land that have been mined and left unreclaimed. Abandoned mines account for 59 Super-fund sites and there are more than 2,000 abandoned mines in our national parks. The Mineral Policy Center estimates that the cleanup costs for abandoned mines on public and private lands may reach $72 billion. Rather than reform the industry through comprehensive legislation or proper execution of exist-ing executive branch authority, we will once again block reform through a rider. It is time that we put an end to this policy of undermining the environ-ment, of gutting environmental protec-tions, by slipping riders through the back door of every spending bill. We ought to be a better Senate than that. We ought to have our debates on the floor, in public, and if you want to pro-mote a vision of an America where we turn the environment over to polluters, over to those who would destroy our natural resources, if that's your vision, then let's debate it\u2014and let's end the practice of environmental degradation through appropriations bills. Before I yield the floor, I do want to draw our attention to something in this supplemental bill which I believe is an important victory for Massachu-setts, and for our fishermen. I am pleased that $1.88 million was included for NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service, NMFS, to promote cooperative management and research activities in the Northeast multispecies fishery. These funds will complement the $5 million in emergency assistance that was appropriated for Gulf of Maine fishermen last November. Many in this Chamber know that too many fishermen in New England are experiencing economic hardship due to new groundfish regulations recently imposed in the Gulf of Maine. In order to help alleviate the negative effects of these new regulations, fishermen have joined with NMFS in developing a spending plan for the $5 million in emergency assistance. The plan pro-poses to compensate fishermen for lost fishing opportunities that have re-sulted from inshore groundfish clo-sures. Fishermen, in return, will make their vessels available to take part in cooperative research projects. A por-tion of the $1.88 million will be used to fund the cooperative scientific projects that will be conducted by NMFS and other institutions. In addition, some of the new funding will be used to employ fishermen as scientific observers. This new partnership will have a twofold benefit. Cooperative research activities will keep fishermen employed on the water while groundfish stocks recover, VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov \u2014 SENATE S5678 May 20, 1999 and this plan will promote a more con- structive relationship between fisher-men and NMFS with the goal of im-proving management activities in the Gulf of Maine groundfish fishery. I ex-press my very real appreciation for the support of Senate Appropriations chairman, Senator T EDSTEVENS and the Democratic ranking member, Sen-ator B YRD, for including this provision in the conference report and for their continued steadfast support of the New England fishermen. In conclusion, let me just say that I fully support the American men and women who are putting their lives in jeopardy in the Kosovo region for a mission which I believe in very deep-ly\u2014as a veteran, I support their inter-ests very personally in fact. I would have liked to have seen the Senate produce an Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill that we could all vote for, unanimously. But this bill is a far cry from that kind of legislation, a far cry from the kind of bipartisan foreign policy we demand from our leaders in the United States. I am en-tirely disappointed that some members of the Senate have used this bill as a vehicle to hurt low-income working families and damage the environment we all share. Mr. President, we are a great country of Americans who care about each other, who believe that we have a na-tional purpose and that part of the rea-son we are a special nation is that we help each other make it through the times and make the most of our own lives. We're a great nation. We ought to be a great Senate that reflects that sense of commitment to one another, and I look forward to the day when those values return to this Chamber. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have three additional speakers. I sent word to them. Does the distinguished Sen-ator from Mississippi have any sugges-tions at the moment? Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I in- tend to reserve our time until just be-fore the vote, if that is satisfactory. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if it is agreeable with the distinguished Sen-ator from Mississippi, I ask unanimous consent there be a recess for 3 minutes and it not be charged against the time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. COCHRAN. We would just sug- gest the absence of a quorum for that time. Mr. BYRD. We can't call off a quorum in 3 minutes if anybody ob-jects. Mr. COCHRAN. I do not intend to ob- ject and I hope no one would. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the time will not be charged. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unan- imous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have no more requests for time. I yield my time back. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Mississippi. Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, there has been some conversation about dis-aster assistance for farmers and com-plaints that this bill does not go far enough to address the needs in the ag-riculture community for disaster as-sistance. I point out to Senators that there are funds in here that will provide guaran-teed loans for those farmers who are having difficulty getting financing for this year's crop so that the Govern-ment will guarantee the repayment of that loan. That will allow them to get loans they otherwise would not be able to get because of the inability to show that this year's crop will produce a profit. This is a real problem, and we are sensitive to that. We have had hearings on that subject, and we are aware of it. In this conference report, we spell out, in addition to the funds I have talked about already in the bill, the following: The conferees recognize the problems fac- ing agricultural producers today and under-stand that the actual needs for disaster as-sistance funds provided last year likely will exceed the projections of the Department of Agriculture. The Department of Agriculture has projected that net farm income will de-cline $3 billion below last year. The con-ferees expect the administration to monitor the situation closely and if necessary, sub-mit requests for additional funds to the Con-gress for consideration. This acknowledges that the problems are real. We know they are real. Last year was a big disaster in agriculture, and the Congress and the administra-tion agreed to respond with a multibil-lion-dollar disaster assistance pro-gram. Some of the farmers have not gotten the benefits of that program yet. We provide funds to accelerate the availability of those benefits from the Department of Agriculture, and we are meeting every request that has been submitted by this administration for additional funds for that purpose. The conference is sensitive to those needs. We did reject an amendment that was offered to increase the fund-ing, and we hope the administration will let us know if additional funds are truly needed. In many cases, it is impossible to de- termine what the assistance needs will be until after the crop year has begun. In many places, we have not even seen planting, but we do think this is re-sponsive to that problem. Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report ac-companying H.R. 1141, the fiscal year 1999 emergency supplemental appro-priations bill. The pending bill includes emergency funding to finance the United States participation in NATO military oper- ations in Kosovo and Yugoslavia. This supplemental makes available $11.0 bil-lion in emergency, and contingency emergency, defense appropriations based on the crisis in Kosovo and the closely related readiness crisis in our armed forces. Of these funds, $10.8 billion are appro- priated to the Department of Defense: The supplemental provides the $5.5 billion the President requested for military operations in Kosovo and De-partment of Defense refugee assistance. It also provides some very needed readiness funding, specifically: $1.0 bil-lion for procurement of depleted muni-tions stocks; $1.1 billion for spare parts, stocks of which have reached cri-sis proportions for some weapon sys-tems; $700 million for overdue mainte-nance of these same weapons systems; $100 million for recruiting to address DoD's retention crisis; $200 million to improve the declining training of mili-tary personnel in high priority mili-tary specialties, and $200 million to re-pair aging bases. These are important additions that clearly merit this additional funding and an ''emergency'' designation. Some will argue that these adds for defense are too much; others will argue, cor-rectly I believe, that these readiness increases are overdue. I have received both official and unofficial reports of extremely serious readiness problems in our armed forces. This additional funding will just begin to address these problems correctly. The legislation also makes $475 mil- lion available to the Secretary of De-fense for Military Construction for him to use, under proper controls, as he sees fit. Another $1.8 billion is provided for military pay and pensions, subject to authorization legislation that Con-gress may choose to enact. Both of these latter additions are deemed ''contingent emergencies.'' The money will only be expended if the President agrees that the needs con-stitute an emergency and the funds should be spent for the stated purpose. The President need not spend these funds if he so selects. This, I believe, is an appropriate way to make these funds available. I strongly support these funds for our troops in the Balkans and for those in other parts of the world who may soon find themselves also involved in this troubling conflict. Regardless of our views regarding the conflict in the Bal-kans, we must fully support our armed forces being employed there and ensure that their equipment and training is fully and completely supported. It would be dangerous and foolish to do anything less. The conferees also provide $1.1 billion for humanitarian assistance to refu-gees from Kosovo. Congress provided an additional $548 million above the President's request to aid refugees that have fled Kosovo and the 20,000 that are temporarily resettling in the United States. This is a significant infusion of VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5679 May 20, 1999 resources to address an increasingly desperate situation in the nations bor-dering Kosovo. I commend the managers of the con- ference report for including the emer-gency aid to Central American coun-tries who suffered form the ravages of Hurricane Mitch. This aid is for our neighbors who faced devastation of Biblical proportions last fall. The final aid package totals $814 million for the region. I remind my colleagues that the United States has worked for more than a quarter of a century to help de-velop democratic movements in this region. The need to move quickly and pass this funding cannot be overstated. When I visited the region in December, I was gratified to hear government agencies and relief groups emphasize over and over again, ''We want your help, not forever, but so we can begin to help ourselves and continue building stable and democratic societies.'' In addition to these critical items, the final bill addresses the President's request for a $100 million appropriation for Jordan under the Wye Peace Ac-cord. The Congress also provides an ad-ditional $574 million for aid to Amer-ica's farmers following the $5.9 billion in emergency aid approved by Congress last October. It is also important to note that the conferees have taken swift action to ensure that sufficient disaster aid through the Federal Emer-gency Management Agency, FEMA, is available for Oklahoma, Kansas, and other Midwestern states that have been severely damaged by recent tornadoes. Mr. President, I will ask unanimous consent to print in the R ECORD at the conclusion of my remarks a table by the Congressional Budget Office that summarizes the spending in the pend-ing bill. Mr. President, including offsets to some of the nondefense emergency and non-emergency spending in the bill, the net total of the final bill is $11.35 bil-lion in BA and $3.7 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1999. An estimated $2.0 billion in BA and $7.4 billion in outlays will be expended in fiscal year 2000 ac-cording to CBO estimates of the bill. Finally, I address an issue raised by the inclusion of a provision in the con-ference report concerning the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, OPIC. Because this language in the con-ference report attempts to change the way we treat an OPIC program under title V of the Budget Act (The Federal Credit Reform Act), it violates section 306 of the Budget Act. We have consulted with CBO and OMB, and both agencies say they will not change their treatment of OPIC programs from past practices because of this provision. Therefore I will not challenge this language, because I do not think the conference report will have any practical effect on credit re-form or our budgetary treatment of OPIC programs. I support this bill. It is largely an emergency spending package that re-sponds to serious natural disasters at home and abroad, and to the NATO military campaign in the Balkans and the resulting tragedy of thousands of Kosovar refugees displaced during this conflict. I urge the adoption of the con-ference report. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent that the table to which I referred be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: SUMMARY OF FY 1999 SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS, H.R. 1141 [Conference agreement, by fiscal year, in millions of dollars] 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Beyond Total 74 8 8 8 8 8 8 \u00a5178 O 76 85 8 8 8 8 8 8 \u00a5177 O 95 102 5 Nondefense ..................................................................................................................... ...............

Source: Congressional Budget Office. KOSOVO : A LONG ROAD TO NOWHERE ? Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we will soon vote on a $15 billion spending bill that will, among other things, fur-ther fund the war against Yugoslavia. Although the Administration requested some $6 billion for military and hu-manitarian needs for the Kosovo oper-ation, this amount has almost doubled, and is well over $11 billion. Sadly, this higher figure will not get our readiness back where it needs to be\u2014where we could, at the drop of the hat, success-fully wage two full scale wars at the same time\u2014as directed in the ''Quad- rennial Defense Review.'' It also illustrates something seri- ously gone wrong here in Washington, D.C. Only a small amount of these funds are subject to offsets\u2014its as if there is this notion, both in the Admin-istration and in Congress, that this is ''free money.'' Well it's not, Mr. Presi-dent. For every dollar spent, another priority loses out. And I can think of a whole host of areas where this money would be better spent than in fighting a war in a part of the world where most Americans can't clearly identify on a map. Tax cuts, Social Security, Edu-cation, to name just a few. I will vote against this bill for two reasons: (1) our Kosovo policy is seri-ously flawed and the only way we in Congress can truly voice our opposition is voting where it hurts the most\u2014the pocketbook; and (2) this is a spending bill gone mad\u2014there is no fiscal ac-countability here, nor is there any no-tion of fiscal responsibility. This vote, at least for me, will be one of the toughest I have had to cast in my tenure in the United States Senate. I strongly support our military, and am proud of our men and women in uniform. I certainly do not want to jeopardize our people who are charged with carrying out this war. But even so, this is not a vote against our mili-tary\u2014rather, it is a vote in opposition VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, SENATE S5680 May 20, 1999 to the Administration's seriously flawed, if not inept Kosovo policy. No one disputes that Milosevic is a bad person and that he should be stopped. His brutal, persistent attacks on the Albanian Kosovar people is akin to Germany in the Second World War. But air strikes alone are not going to do it\u2014they will level Yugoslavia, de-stroy most of its infrastructure, ter-rorize its civilian population, and most likely, not be successful stopping Milosevic. I do not believe that our war fighters' are being given sufficient latitude to make this mission a success. Their de-cisions are subject to dual-review: (1) the ''political'' review of the White House; and (2) the ''consensus'' of our NATO allies through every step of the war. A few examples. General Clark's re- quest to deploy gunships continues to be denied by ''senior military advisors in Washington, D.C.'' Who are these people? The Joint-Chiefs of Staff? Or Sandy Berger and Madeleine Albright? It took over a month to get Apache helicopters to the region; and they sit grounded because the ''polls'' show no support for a ground campaign. It seems to me that one of the first priorities in waging a war is to cut off the supply lines of the other side\u2014and oil, in particular, so that they cannot fuel their tanks and planes. Unbelievably, the NATO alliance re- fused to cut off the flow of fuel that fires Milosevic's war machine. Al-though the U.S. proposed a blockade to stop the oil, it was defeated by France which opposed implementing a block-ade without a formal declaration of war. We are executing massive, full scale air bombings every day; people are being killed; but the French believe a declaration of war must be a pre-condition for a blockade. Our bombs have gone off course sev- eral times, hitting refugee convoys, the country of Bulgaria, and the Chinese embassy in Belgrade\u2014which is tech-nically Chinese soil in Yugoslavia. At least in the case of the Chinese embassy, it wasn't the bombs at fault, it was our intelligence. Although the tourist maps in Belgrade accurately place the Chinese embassy in that lo-cale, our intelligence was using an out-dated map that led them to believe it was a procurement center for the Ser-bian military. The Chinese people are outraged, and well they should be. But the American people should be just as outraged\u2014not just by this bombing, but by the con-tinued incompetence which has come to typify this policy. I fail to understand how waging this war by NATO consensus is getting us anywhere except more deeply involved militarily, and less likely to find a dip-lomatic solution to this crisis. Mr. President, wars should not be waged by consensus, and diplomacy should not be directed by polls. Internationally, the world is a much less stable place than it was even two months before. There was a sense of op- timism that Russia might help broker a diplomatic solution to Kosovo. The possibility remains, but Russia is far less stable than previously thought: President Yeltsin survived an impeach-ment proceeding, but he has again dis-banded his government to the degree that it is unclear who in Russia has the power to help negotiate an end to this crisis. The Chinese are no longer just a side- line observer. While China has opposed the NATO bombings from the outset, it didn't have a dog in this fight until we bombed their embassy in Belgrade. If a deal on Kosovo is reached, it will have to pass muster with the Chinese who hold veto authority on the U.N. Secu-rity Council. We continue to bomb Iraq daily\u2014 stretching our Air Force readiness even further. Saddam Hussein shows no signs of letting up, and will most likely use this as an opportunity to push us even further. And last, but not least, the Korean Peninsula continues to be a crisis in waiting. Starvation in North Korea is rampant, food supplies are gone, and the country is undergoing one of the worst droughts in history. If the North Koreans decide to engage us militarily, we will be fighting three wars at the same time\u2014beyond that envisioned by our military strategists in the Quad-rennial Defense Review, and perhaps much more than we are currently pre-pared to do. Again, we will soon vote on this sup- plemental funding package. Over $15 billion. And when the war is over, we will be asked to vote on additional funding to rebuild Yugoslavia. We will probably vote to rebuild the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. And if we approve additional funds for the military cam-paign, the end costs of rebuilding Yugoslavia will only continue to mount. My vote does not undermine my sup- port, concern or pride for our military. But I do believe that a diplomatic solu-tion to this problem should have been found, can still be found, and must be found if we are to avoid the further es-calation of this war. Failure to do so will cost us precipitously\u2014not just in dollars, but in American lives. I yield the floor. Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the $15 billion supple-mental appropriations conference re-port before us. The supplemental spends far more than is necessary to support our effort in Kosovo and, worse, will take vitally needed money out of the Social Security surplus, thereby raiding the Social Security Trust Fund. Protecting the Social Security trust fund is one of my highest priorities. The Social Security system is expected to go into deficit in 2014 and we will need every dollar of that surplus today in order to be prepared for the tomor-rows ahead of us. Until this point, the Senate has been headed in the right direction on Social Security. The Budget Resolution, which I strongly supported, called for reduced debt and taxes, increased fund-ing for education and national defense, and maintaining the spending caps so necessary to control spending. Perhaps most importantly, the budg- et resolution built in on-budget sur-pluses from the year 2001 and beyond. This is significant because surpluses that are accumulating in the Social Security Trust Funds will no longer be used to finance on-budget operations of government. Social Security surpluses should not be used to finance deficits in the rest of government. The Budget Resolution stood in stark contrast to President Clinton's budget, which, over the next five years, pro-posed spending $158 billion of the So-cial Security surpluses on non-Social Security programs. The Budget Resolution, in addition to preserving every penny of Social Se-curity surpluses, also contained proce-dural hurdles blocking future budgets from spending Social Security sur-pluses. These procedures included a point of order against on-budget deficits and an amendment calling for reducing the debt ceiling by the amount of the So-cial Security surplus\u2014the lockbox pro-vision. The Senate voted in favor of both the point of order and the lockbox by unan-imous votes during the budget resolu-tion. In addition, the Abraham-Domenici- Ashcroft lockbox legislation, which is still pending in the Senate, would put these procedures into law, and ensure that Congress could not spend the So-cial Security surpluses on non-Social Security purposes. Unfortunately, the supplemental ap- propriations package before us would undo some of the good work that we have already done this session. By not offsetting $13 billion of the spending, the supplemental takes money from the Social Security sur-pluses, money that is necessary to pro-tect the Social Security trust funds. Thus far, Congress has been com- mitted to stopping the raid on Social Security. This Congress has passed a budget that is balanced without using Social Security funds. This conference report, however, not only spends Social Security funds, but also contains $1.2 billion in traditional pork spending. I refer to such spending as $45 million for Census funding, $3.76 million for the House page dormitory, and $1.8 million for the O'Neill House building. If this bill were just for Kosovo and true emergency spending, I would vote for it. If this bill were fully offset, I would vote for it. But this bill is nei-ther all emergency nor all offset. This bill, like the $21 billion omnibus appro-priation last fall, is an abrogation of our responsibility to protect the Social Security surplus. Mr. President, this is not the way that we should handle Congress' re-sponsibility over the federal purse VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5681 May 20, 1999 strings. If we face real emergencies, we should fund those emergencies. But funding those emergencies is not free. We need to pay for all spending, emergency or not. This is why I sup-port Senator E NZI's attempt to make sure that this entire appropriation is offset. If we do not offset our spending, the money comes out of the Social Secu-rity surplus. There is no getting around this fact. We must pay for any new funding. If we do not pay for it, it comes out of the Social Security sur-plus. The Social Security program is too important to be raided. While I recog-nize the importance of emergency funding, particularly for Kosovo, I also recognize that spending needs to be paid for. Mr. President, this request is not un- reasonable. All across this great land, when families face unexpected ex-penses, they must offset their spending by readjusting their priorities. No fam-ily in America would react to an unex-pected crisis by going out and spending more money on other discretionary, non-budgeted items. All I am asking is that the Congress do the same. This supplemental spends too much money and offsets too little of it. If we are to keep our financial house in order, and to protect the Social Secu-rity trust funds, it is time that we in Congress started to change our behav-ior. If we are to maintain our Social Se- curity obligations, we need to learn how to spend less money, and offset more. It is with regret that I feel obli-gated to oppose this conference report. Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I support this supplemental emergency appropriations bill. It is far from per-fect, and I have serious reservations about some provisions. At the same time, the legislation would provide vi-tally important funding for our oper-ations in Kosovo, as well as several other important provisions. So, on bal-ance, I have concluded that the bill de-serves my support. Mr. President, of the $15 billion in new spending this bill contains, $12 bil-lion is to support our important mis-sion in Kosovo, to punish Slobodan Milosevic for his brutal policy of eth-nic cleansing, compel a political settle-ment, and facilitate the return of the Kosovar Albanian refugees to their homeland. The tragedy in Kosovo rep-resents a turning point for NATO, Eu-ropean security, and American leader-ship in the 21st century. I am glad that Congress has shown its support for the President with the funding contained in this bill for the military operation and the humanitarian assistance. The bill also contains funds to ensure that the International Criminal Tri-bunal for former Yugoslavia can effec-tively investigate and prosecute the perpetrators of the atrocities com-mitted in Kosovo and those in Belgrade who ordered them to carry out this campaign of terror. They must be brought to justice. I am also glad that after a long delay we have provided the necessary assist-ance for Central American countries to recover from the devastation imposed last fall by Hurricanes Mitch and Georges. Mr. President, this bill also contains a provision that helps family members of the victims of the terrible Pan Am 103 bombing to attend the trial of the charged criminals before the Scottish court in the Netherlands. As you know, Mr. President, many New Jersey na-tives were on that flight. These fami-lies have waited too long for justice to be brought, and I am glad that they will be able to see it rendered first-hand. The bill also provides $100 million for Jordan, to help support its role in ad-vancing the Middle East peace process. The region stands at a critical juncture after the death of King Hussein and the election of Ehud Barak as Israeli Prime Minister. I am glad we provided this down-payment for Jordan. Now we must follow through on our commit-ment for Israel and the Palestinian Au-thority per the Wye River Memo-randum the U.S. helped broker. Mr. President, despite these positive elements, the bill before us has many flaws. It contains more than $6 billion in unrequested defense spending, far in excess of what it will take to prosecute the air war against Milosevic. It stretches the definition of what con-stitutes an ''emergency'' to such an ex-tent that it mocks the notion of fiscal discipline. This year's concurrent resolution on the budget established five explicit cri-teria to guide the use of the emergency designation, which allows funding be-yond the discretionary caps. These cri-teria relate to whether an item is (i) necessary, essential, or vital (not mere-ly useful or beneficial); (ii) sudden, quickly coming into being, and not building up over time; (iii) an urgent, pressing, and compelling need requir-ing immediate action; (iv) unforeseen, unpredictable, and unanticipated; and (v) not permanent, temporary in na-ture. Unfortunately, it is difficult to see how some of this defense spending con-stitutes an emergency. For example, while increasing military compensa-tion may be a laudable goal, it hardly represents an emergency under these criteria. I also am disturbed by the apparent disparate treatment of offsets. As my colleagues know, under the Budget Act, funding for emergency spending does not count against the discre-tionary caps and therefore does not have to be offset. For some reason, however, the Majority feels that offsets are necessary\u2014but for only for the ag-riculture and humanitarian emer-gencies, not the military portion. This double standard defies logic. If some-thing is an emergency, no offsets should be required. If it is not an emer-gency, then we should not use the emergency designation and we should pay for it with spending reductions. However, of all the problems with this bill, I am most disappointed in the provisions related to the recent multi- state tobacco settlement. These provi-sions waive the Federal government's right to recoup its share of recovered tobacco Medicaid costs without any guarantees that State governments will spend even a penny of these settle-ment funds on tobacco control pro-grams. Mr. President, these provisions\u2014 stuck into this large emergency supple-mental appropriations bill\u2014hand the tobacco industry a big victory. The to-bacco lobby wanted to avoid an effec-tive, nationwide anti-youth smoking effort. And unfortunately, it looks like their wish was granted. Mr. President, some have character- ized this recoupment of Federal Med-icaid dollars as a Federal ''money grab'' of State dollars. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is without question that a large portion of the state settlements with the tobacco industry represents a re-covery of Federal funds. I should know, because I have been working with the state attorneys general on these cases since they were filed. In fact, I introduced the first ''To- bacco Medicaid Waiver'' bill back in 1996. At that time, I was joined by Mis-sissippi Attorney General Mike Moore and Minnesota Attorney General Skip Humphrey at the introduction of a bill that would allow States to keep part of the Federal share of Medicaid. At the time, there were only ten states suing, and my bill was aimed at urging more States to bring claims. Mr. President, back then, none of these pioneering state officials ever said that the Federal Government had no right to Medicaid recoupment. It is a preposterous argument. The states sued under the Federal Medicaid stat-ute\u2014they knew that then and they know that now. Mr. President, there is no question under current law that a portion of these settlements are Federal funds. It is also important to note that the to-bacco settlement signed by the States blocks the Federal government from seeking reimbursement for Federal Medicaid costs caused by tobacco com-pany misconduct in the future. So, in other words, the States waived our rights too. Let me be clear: I think we should ul- timately give this money back to the States\u2014but we must have guarantees that a portion of this tobacco recoupment will be used to reduce youth smoking, assist children and promote public health. Mr. President, the provisions stuck into this bill are bad policy and pri-marily benefit one party: the tobacco industry. The losers will be America's children. Because of this provision, more young people will begin to smoke. And many of them, ultimately, will die as a result. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5682 May 20, 1999 Mr. President, that's not right. And I hope Congress will reconsider this deci-sion in the future. Still, Mr. President, this conference report does contain several other im-portant provisions, including funding for our operations in Kosovo. So, while I do so with some reluctance, I will support it. Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of our time to the dis-tinguished Senator from Alaska. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Alaska. Mr. STEVENS. How much time do I have? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes 12 seconds. Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair, and I thank my good friend from Mis-sissippi for managing the bill for us as we had a distinguished visitor in the Appropriations Committee room. Mr. President, there is a lot of con- troversy about this bill, but I think this bill represents the best of Amer-ica. We have reacted to crises abroad and crises in this country. There are items in this bill that are not emergencies. While many people are saying they should not be here be-cause they are not emergencies, they are here because this is a supplemental and an emergency bill. It is a bill that we can all vote for in good conscience, and I hope there will be an over-whelming vote for this. Again, I point out for the Senate that the men and women of the armed serv-ices are aware of this bill. It means a great deal to them. It is a symbol of our commitment to the pay raise for which we have already gone on record. It is a symbol that we are going to step forward to modernize the armed services. It is a symbol that we are going to provide the money to assure these people when they are sent over-seas, whether it is Kosovo or in the area of Iraq or in South Korea, or in Bosnia\u2014wherever it may be in those 93 countries of the world that the Amer-ican service men and women are now serving\u2014we are going to stand behind them and give them all the support they need not only for their safety but for their comfort. The passage of this bill will mean that we can now go ahead with the bal-ance of our necessary actions in the Appropriations Committee. We have 13 full bills that come forward. I hope this will be the last supplemental of this year. I join the majority leader in not welcoming supplemental bills. But I know there are times when it is nec-essary; and this one is necessary. Anyone who looks at our involve- ment in the world knows that we can-not calculate in advance the costs of events, such as the Kosovo operation, both militarily and in regard to refu-gees. These were things that came up after we planned expenditures for 1999 in the fall of last year. I urge the Members of the Senate to vote for this bill. I urge that we, as quickly as possible, get it to the Presi-dent so he can sign it today. I yield back any time I have and ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. G OR- TON). Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back? All time having been yielded back, the question is on agreeing to the con-ference report to accompany H.R. 1141. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.

Mr. President, as the sup- plemental appropriations conference report stands, it is currently $13.3 bil-lion out of balance. Only $2 billion of the spending in this bill is offset and my bill will ensure that Congress fol-lows the rules and not dip into the So-cial Security surplus to fund all the truly non-emergency items in the sup-plemental appropriations bill. The legislation that I have intro- duced imposes much needed fiscal dis-cipline. I have been working for a bal-anced budget since I was first elected to the Senate and the supplemental be-gins the process of undoing that work. Congress must not go back to the old spending rules\u2014just because we have a surplus that does not mean that the battle has been won. It means that we must continue to be watchful and en-sure that the surplus continues to grow. Some of the items in this bill are true emergencies such as disaster relief in Oklahoma, livestock assistance and Hurricane Mitch relief. However, there are many items that are not emer-gencies, like $48 million for a new sat-ellite for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and $3.75 million for ren-ovations to the House page dormitory. There is $45 million for unanticipated costs associated with the census, to an accountant it seems that there needs to be better cost control to prevent such things. There are millions of dol-lars in examples of items that are not emergencies but have been designated as such. Many of these items should have been debated in the fiscal year 2000 appropriations process. Even while the economy is strong, I remain concerned about the debt that we are in danger of passing on to our children and our grandchildren. In the past, it seemed we were so tied to the immediate gratification we receive from spending money that we didn't see the danger that looms in the not too distant future\u2014the risk associated with spending ''on credit'' with reck-less abandon. We still don't acknowl-edge that danger. The genesis of this bill was to pay for the current military conflict in Kosovo. I fully support the troops and I was prepared to vote to pay for the costs of supporting our men an women in uniform, but the supplemental goes far beyond what I was prepared to sup-port. Many of these items are best left to the Department of Defense author-ization bill or the Soldier's, Sailor's and Airman's Bill of Rights, which passed the Senate and contained a much needed pay raise for the armed services. The pay raise contained in the supplemental jumps the gun. The House should have the opportunity to consider the authorizing legislation be-fore the money is appropriated. Just passing a balanced budget reso- lution is not enough. Congress must continue to be on watch for attempts to violate not just the letter of resolu-tion, but the spirit through spending bills that are not offset. This Legisla-tion will ensure that the bill fits under the spending caps and that the surplus is protected. As a body, we have been seriously de- bating locking up the Social Security surplus to ensure that the money will be there to honor America' contract with our senior citizens. Now we have a bill that dips into the surplus to pay for a Christmas tree of items under the false pretenses of an emergency. This is exactly what the lock box was designed to prevent. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent that the text of the bill be printed in the R ECORD . VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 \u2014 SENATE S5683 May 20, 1999 There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: S. 1097 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. OFFSET OF EMERGENCY SUPPLE- MENTAL SPENDING. Not later than 15 days after Congress ad- journs to end the first session of the 106th Congress and on the same day as a sequestra-tion (if any) under sections 251 and 252 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall cause, in the same manner prescribed for section 251 of that Act, a sequestration for fiscal year 2000 of all non-exempt accounts within the discre-tionary spending category (excluding func-tion 050 (national defense)) to achieve a re-duction in budget authority equal to $13,303,000,000 minus the dollar amount of re-imbursements identified in the report re-quired by section 2005 (efforts to increase burden-sharing) of the 1999 Emergency Sup-plemental Appropriations Act. Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator E NZI's bill to offset all of the nonemergency funding in the supplemental with an across the board cut in non-defense discretionary accounts. As one who vigorously opposed the omnibus appropriations bill of last year which resulted in spending far above our commitments, I was sur-prised that here we have yet another attempt to circumvent our budget principles\u2014and to spend part of the So-cial Security surplus nearly all of us pledged to devote only to Social Secu-rity. While there are true emergencies in the supplemental I support, such as the agriculture spending and funds directly related to our Kosovo operation, I strongly oppose inclusion of other de-fense spending that clearly should be considered in the normal appropria-tions process. And I oppose beefing up the FEMA budget three times over the President's request as well. What all of this is about is just a gimmick to claim we are not breaking the caps as we pro-ceed into the fiscal year 2000 appropria-tions process by providing some fund-ing now. The last estimate I saw indi-cated only $2.5 billion of this funding will be outlayed in this fiscal year. So\u2014why are we appropriating $15 bil- lion? Mr. President, I have no objection to this additional spending\u2014if we pay for it. Senator E NZI's legislation, which I have cosponsored does pay for it. This is the responsible thing to do, since most of this bill\u2014over $13 billion is not emergency spending. Those who believe in integrity of our budget process and in the need to pre-serve Social Security will vote for this bill. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator E NZI's bill to off- set the supplemental appropriations bill. Senator E NSZI's bill is consistent with my belief that we must pay for this emergency supplemental bill with offsets. Mr. President, under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Congress, the Presi-dent, and the American people agreed to cap the growth of our Government's spending programs. In doing this we were able to balance the budget and head down the path of fiscal responsi-bility. We have agreed under the law to these spending caps. We should not now turn our backs on the commitment we made to the American people, by going back on our word and breaking this agreement with them. Because of this commitment to the American people, Congress must not bust these spending caps. In that same vein, at the zenith of our success to have finally balanced the Federal Government's budget for the first time in 29 years, we ought not look to spend $13 billion we don't have. We can ill afford to use our first wave of surpluses, especially the surpluses garnered from the Social Security trust fund to pay for this supple-mental. We can ill afford at this crit-ical juncture to break our pledge to our seniors over social security, not to the public over keeping our budgets bal-anced. In closing Mr. President, I believe Senator E NZI's bill, of which I am an original cosponsor, is right on the mark. We need to use common sense in budgeting in our Nation's Capitol. Granted we have several emergencies confronting us, from the disasters that have hit our constituents across the land, the need to increase FEMA's funding to meet these needs, des-perately needed funds for our farmers\u2014 including my provision to the bill that will help our farmers to qualify for dis-aster funds, up to the need to support our troops in Kosovo. But\u2014we must pay the bill. I support Senator E NZIand our other cosponsors, by calling for re-duced spending in other federal pro-grams in order to fund these necessary emergencies. This is truly the only way this Congress can justify spending money we don't have. Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to make a couple of unanimous consent requests. First, I want to commend the chair- man of the Appropriations Committee for his work on the supplemental ap-propriations. It is never easy for him, but it is easy for us to second-guess and be judgmental. In his unique way he does a magnificent job. f VIOLENT AND REPEAT JUVENILE ACCOUNTABILITY AND REHA-BILITATION ACT OF 1999 The Senate continued with the con- sideration of the bill. Mr. LOTT. I believe the procedure is that Senator H ARKIN would be entitled to the floor, but this unanimous con-sent agreement will take care of that problem and we will be able to move forward. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to vote on or in rela-tion to the Ashcroft-Frist amendment, No. 355, after 20 minutes of debate to be equally divided in the usual form; fol-lowing that vote, if agreed to, the Sen-ate immediately agree to an amend-ment to be offered by Senator H ARKIN . I further ask that following the dis-position of the above two mentioned amendments, if the Ashcroft-Frist amendment is agreed to, the following be the only amendments remaining in order and under a time agreement equally divided, and all other provi-sions of the previous consent of May 14 still be in place. The amendments are as follows: The Bond amendment regarding the film industry, 30 minutes; the Biden amend-ment, 45 minutes, with 30 minutes under the control of Senator B IDEN and 15 minutes under the control of Sen-ator H ATCH . I further ask that following the dis- position of the above-listed amend-ments, the bill be advanced to third reading and passage occur, all without any intervening action or debate. Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserv- ing the right to object, and I will not because I think we need to move quick-ly here, I want to thank all those who are responsible for getting us to this point. This has taken some cooperation on the part of both sides. I especially want to thank Senators H ARKIN , ASHCROFT , FRIST, BIDEN, W ELLSTONE and others who have been very helpful. I have no objection. Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, I am sorry that I did not hear the entire request, but the situation, as I understand it, prior to right now, was that after the supplemental, we were coming back to the Frist-Ashcroft amendment and I was to be recognized. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator is correct. Mr. HARKIN. What does this do to that? Mr. LOTT. This would obviate that and we would move forward with the procedure that is outlined. We would proceed to vote on or in relation to the Ashcroft amendment with time equally divided for 20 minutes, and then the Senate would immediately agree to the amendment offered by Senator H ARKIN . Mr. HARKIN. As I understand it, what you are saying is right now we would have 20 minutes? Mr. LOTT. Right. Equally divided in the usual form. Mr. HARKIN. Then you would vote up or down on the Frist-Ashcroft amendment, and then there would be\u2014 then what? Mr. LOTT. Then we would go directly to the agreement to accept the Harkin amendment. Mr. HARKIN. OK. I am OK with that. I must be very honest with you. I have been waiting some time to be able to at least make my case on the floor. I have been more than willing to set everything aside and to let the process go ahead since yesterday. But I must tell you that since yesterday I have been waiting to get at least 15 to 20 minutes where I could just lay out my VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, SENATE S5684 May 20, 1999 case on the Frist-Ashcroft amendment on IDEA, the background of it. I just believe I have to. I want to be able to fully make my case against the amend-ment. I do not want to take a lot of time, I do not want to filibuster it, but I would like to have 15 or 20 minutes just to lay out my case. That is all. Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, perhaps I could amend the unanimous consent request to this effect, that we have 30 minutes on the Ashcroft and the Har-kin amendments, with each side get-ting 15 minutes. The Senator would have 15 minutes, Senators A SHCROFT and F RIST would have 15 minutes, and they would split it up between them-selves. I modify my request to that ef-fect. Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserv- ing my right to object, I support that request. Just for clarification purposes, Senator B IDEN wants to be sure that the other part of the arrangement we had, which was an up-or-down vote on his amendment, would occur. I just would clarify that for the record. I un-derstand that to be the case. Mr. LOTT. That will be the way the vote will occur. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing no objection, the unanimous consent agreement is agreed to. Mr. LOTT. I thank all involved. I yield the floor. Mr. DASCHLE. If I could just ask the majority leader, we had one Member's request; Senator K ERRY asked if he could have a period of time\u2014I suggest 10 minutes\u2014prior to final passage, for him to be recognized. Mr. LOTT. Would it be possible he could do that after final passage? The reason why, and I understand\u2014I would like any Senator to be able to do that\u2014 we do have a number of Senators who would like to be able to leave by 6. You are talking about airplanes. You are talking about a son's athletic event. It is the usual thing. To admit we have these sorts of requests is not always easy. Mr. DASCHLE. Perhaps we can con- sult with Senator K ERRY . Mr. LOTT. Perhaps we will not use all the time and we could stick it in there, but if he would be willing to at least consider it after final passage it would help a number of his colleagues. We will work on that. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Iowa. AMENDMENT NO . 355 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are now back on the Frist-Ashcroft amend-ment. I am not going to proceed until we have order. I cannot even hear my-self. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ate will be in order. Will the conversa-tions in the aisles be taken somewhere else. The Senator from Iowa. Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I know the recent school tragedies\u2014again, even another this very morning\u2014are a call to action to us as families and churches and schools, as communities, as leaders in government, to take posi-tive, constructive steps to make our schools places of learning and not of fear. But let's not use these tragedies of Littleton and other schools to take emotional, unfounded\u2014although well- intentioned-actions which actually will make our schools and communities more unsafe and less secure. I want to make this point very, very clear. The Frist-Ashcroft amendment is a dangerous, dangerous, dangerous amendment. The Frist-Ashcroft amendment guts IDEA. It actually will make our communities and our schools more unsafe. The purpose of this bill is to help make our schools and communities safer. That is the purpose of the bill in front of us. I must ask, is putting a child with a disability on the street and cutting off all services to that child something that will make our communities more safe? Frankly, it will have the opposite effect. This amendment, would, for example, lead to a child with an emotional dis-turbance being put on the street and end the counseling and behavioral modification services they had been re-ceiving\u2014end, them, cold turkey. No more counseling or behavioral modi-fication services. And this kid is now on the street. Tell me, is that commu-nity safer? Obviously not, but that is just what this amendment would lead to. Troubled children out on the street with no supervision, no tracking, no education, no mental health services. This amendment targets a group of students who are more likely to be vic-tims of school violence than perpetra-tors. Again I want to point out: Not any of the nine\u2014now nine school shootings\u2014in the last 39 months was done by a child in special education. Not one. Yet we have this amendment that targets kids with disabilities. This amendment is scapegoating\u2014and I use that word, ''scapegoating''\u2014scape-goating kids with disability. And it is destroying an important safety feature of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The supporters of the amendment say they need it because the law erected barriers that kept them from taking students who had guns in their posses-sion out of schools. We showed yester-day\u2014and the authors of this amend-ment agreed with me on this point\u2014 that a child with a disability who brings a gun to a school can be re-moved from that school immediately, just like any other child. We settled that yesterday. For a kid with a dis-ability who brings a gun or firearm to school, right now, the principal can call up the sheriff or the police. They can come haul him away, book him, put him in jail, whatever the law is. So I hope no Senator votes on this amendment thinking that under the law as it exists today, a kid with a dis-ability who comes to school with a gun can't be kicked out immediately. That is simply not true. Nothing in Federal law limits them from immediately re-moving him and keeping him out as long as that child is a threat to himself or others. Let me repeat that, the school can remove that child imme-diately and keep them in an alter-native setting indefinitely as long as that child is a threat to himself or oth-ers. It couldn't be more clear than that. We worked long and hard, 3 years of hearings, hammering out the IDEA bill in 1997. And we passed it here in the Senate by a vote of 98 to 1, 98 to 1. We have had no hearings on this amend-ment, none whatsoever. But we had plenty of hearings to set up a frame-work in IDEA to make sure our schools and communities were safe. First, we wanted to make sure the schools were safe. Second, we wanted to make sure the communities were safe. Third, we wanted to make sure students with dis-abilities were held accountable for their actions and that schools have the flexibility to take appropriate and timely actions. Last, we wanted to make sure that decisions were based on facts relevant to the child, not just on emotions. Right now under the law, school au- thorities can unilaterally remove a child with a disability, first of all, for the first 10 days, and provide no serv-ices whatsoever. Second, if it is found that their actions were not a mani-festation of their disability, then of course he is treated in the same man-ner as nondisabled children, and can be kept out in an alternative setting for-ever. If it is found by that the child's ac- tion was a manifestation of their dis-ability, that child then is put into an alternative setting for up to 45 days. That alternative setting is determined by the local school districts. Now we heard yesterday that after 45 days the kid will be put back in school. That is just not so\u2014only if he or she is no longer a danger. If that kid con-tinues to pose a danger to himself or others, the school can repeat that 45 days again and again and again\u2014for as long as it deems necessary. Finally, as I said, there is no way the law prohibits anyone from calling the police to come take any student out who has a gun. I also want to point out, IDEA specifically provides that school officials may obtain a court order any-time to remove a child with a dis-ability from school or to change a child's current educational placement if they believe that maintaining the child in the current educational place-ment is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others. So it is clear, current law addresses the issue. Frankly, we have a commonsense structure now. And, again, it was care-fully designed to make schools and communities safer. The Senator from Missouri yesterday put up a chart showing the manifesta-tion determination process, how you VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5685 May 20, 1999 have to go through all these processes. Why do we do that? He made it seem like it was some bureaucratic maze, or jungle. The reason that we have this manifestation determination is so we can address the behavior of the child with the disability, to determine why that child acted the way the child did, and then to have the proper interven-tions so that child does not behave that way in the future. That's just common sense and it should not be eliminated as this amendment would do. Who does that process help, and who does that protect? Does it not protect the school? Does it not protect the local community? Of course, it does. If we can intervene and provide the prop-er kind of psychological help, maybe even medical help, educational help so that the child with a disability modi-fies his or her behavior, it seems to me that is what we want. Or are we saying under the Frist- Ashcroft amendment: We do not care; if a kid with a disability brings a gun to school, we do not care about that be-havior; kick him out, put him out on the street, cut off all his services? Is that going to make our commu- nity safer? Is that going to make our schools safer? Is that going to protect students? If there is a question about that in anyone's mind, I point to the fact that the shooting in Oregon where students were tragically killed was committed by a kid who had been sus-pended without services from school. He went home, got a gun, and came back to school. I ask, what if a child in that circumstance was put in an alter-native setting with supervision, with appropriate psychological help, behav-ior modification, supporting services? Would that kid have gone home to get the gun and come back to school? I think the odds would have been great that that kid would not. But instead he was put on the street unsupervised\u2014 just as this amendment allows for. That is the ''level playing field'' the supporters of this amendment advo-cate. Mr. President, that is why over 500 police leaders from this country are op-posed to the Frist-Ashcroft amend-ment. I ask unanimous consent to print in the R ECORD a letter from Fight Crime, Invest in Kids. The board of directors includes the president of the Fraternal Order of Police. It encompasses 500 po-lice leaders\u2014many of them the police chiefs in major cities from around the country. It says in part: . . . we urge you to oppose the Frist- Ashcroft amendment, and support the [amendment] to be offered by Senator Har-kin. There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: FIGHT CRIME, INVEST IN KIDS, Washington, DC, May 17, 1999. DEARSENATOR : should we really give kids who bring firearms to school more unsuper-vised time? Senators Frist and Ashcroft's amendments to S. 254 would have precisely that impact. As an organization of more than 500 vic- tims of violence, sheriffs, district attorneys, police chiefs, leaders of police organizations and violence prevention scholars, we urge you to oppose the Frist-Ashcroft amend-ment, and support the substitute to be of-fered by Senator Harkin. Regardless of whether students have dis- abilities or not, schools already can suspend or expel students who bring weapons to school. Nothing in the Individuals with Dis-abilities Education Act (IDEA) prohibits schools from removing immediately a child who brings a gun to school. At the same time, the law recognizes sending the child home or out on the street without edu-cational services is not the answer. That's why IDEA simply requires states to continue education services. The Frist-Ashcroft amendment would eliminate this require-ment for any child who brings a gun to school. We should have tough sanctions for kids who bring a weapon to school. The safety of other students in the school must be para-mount. The Frist-Ashcroft Amendment may sound tough to those who think all kids love school. But giving a gun-toting kid an ex-tended vacation from school and from all re-sponsibility is soft on offenders and dan-gerous for everyone else. Please don't give those kids who most need adult supervision the unsupervised time to rob, become ad-dicted to drugs, and get their hands on other guns to threaten students when the school bell rings. Anti-truancy programs are often an impor- tant part of successful efforts to reduce juve-nile violence. The Frist-Ashcroft amendment encourages mandatory truancy. To minimize the threat these youngsters pose, we should require continued adult su-pervision as well as participation in mental health and behavioral modification pro-grams, and continued school attendance in an appropriate setting, to learn the skills needed to make an honest living. The Harkin Amendment is consistent with this ap-proach. Otherwise expulsion often becomes a graduation to a life of crime that threatens the public immediately and for many years to come. Please let me know if we can be of help in advising on what really works to keep kids from becoming criminals. Sincerely, S ANFORD A. N EWMAN , President. Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, these are the policemen talking. Do you know why they are saying this? Be-cause they know if Frist-Ashcroft is adopted, they are going to dump these kids on the streets\u2014kids with prob-lems, emotional problems, kids with mental problems and behavioral prob-lems, kids who are mentally retarded and may have other problems. They are going to dump them out on the street. That is safe? That is going to make our schools and our communities safe? Please, someone tell me how that is so. That is why the police are opposed to this amendment. I will read a portion of another state- ment: As police chiefs in America's largest cities, we know that investments today to help kids get the right start are among America's most powerful weapons against crime. Qual-ity child care, parenting, coaching, and afterschool programs can help kids learn the values and skills they need to become good neighbors instead of criminals. We, there- fore, call on all our public officials to adopt the policies described in Fight Crime, Invest in Kids. Help schools identify troubled and disruptive children and provide children and their parents with the counseling and train-ing that can help get the kids back on track. These are not social scientists; these are policemen from around the coun-try. Let me also read from the testimony of the Police Executive Research Forum\u2014a leading national organiza-tion of police chiefs and senior law en-forcement officials. Gil Kerlikowski, who at the time was president of this group and the police chief in Buffalo, New York testified at a recent congres-sional hearing on this topic. He said: Students who are expelled or suspended from school and left at home or on the street become my problem, and the problem of po-lice across this country. They have greater opportunity to commit crimes, abuse drugs, or engage in disorderly behavior that affects the quality of life in any given neighborhood. They are also vulnerable to gangs and preda-tors who can victimize and exploit them in ways that will impede any later efforts to put them on the right track. Today's police forces are ill-prepared to deal with these in-dividuals\u2014the rest of the criminal justice system even less so. I also have a letter from the Correc- tional Educational Association again stating that the Frist-Ashcroft amend-ment is more dangerous to our schools and our communities. I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: CORRECTIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION , Lanham, MD, May 17, 1999. Hon. B ILLFRIST, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. D EAR SENATOR FRIST. On behalf of the teachers who labor in the nation's prisons, jails and juvenile facilities, let me implore you to withdraw your amendment and sup-port the Harkin amendment to S. 254. There are enough provisions in the current IDEA to deal with problems related to violent behav-iors, such as carrying or threatening to carry weapons into the school environment. In fact, your bill offers no remedy, whatsoever, for changing the behavior which it seeks to punish. It removes the procedural safeguards designed to assist the offending child to find the necessary help he or she needs. Finally, it punishes the child for his or her disability, not for the offending behavior. It is akin to taking medicine from a sick person because he or she has an obnoxious personality. One of the strengths of IDEA is the proce- dure for dealing with behavior problems. Carrying a weapon to school is a terrible be-havior problem needing immediate action by the whole school community. Dismissal from school services denies a solution to the prob-lem. Why not require the IDEA procedure for any student with a behavior problem, wheth-er or not the student is in special education or not? We need strong procedure to deal with potential and real violence. Doing noth-ing solves nothing. Those of us in criminal justice realize that providing special education students with appropriate instructional services is one of the keys to change their negative behaviors. Punishing a student without positive and ap-propriate assistance changes nothing. In VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5686 May 20, 1999 fact, it just makes things worse. In attempt- ing to help avoid future tragic situations like Littleton, we must be careful to find ways to locate, calm and help potentially violent kids change. Please rescind your amendment. Sincerely, S TEPHEN J. S TEURER , Executive Director. Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have a letter from the Council for Exceptional Children saying: While we . . . strongly support the removal of a student who endangers the safety or well-being of themselves or other students, we strongly oppose the cessation of services for any student. The Frist-Ashcroft amendment ceases those services. What they say is that the school districts may provide the services\u2014may. We already heard one Senator yesterday say how much this costs. It may cost too much, and schools will say: It costs too much money; we are not going to do it; let somebody else provide the services. And the kid falls through the cracks. That is what happens. If you do not think the police know what they are talking about or the Council for Exceptional Children or the Correctional Education Association, how about the Parent Teacher Associa-tion? Do you honestly believe that the National PTA wants more dangerous schools? Here is a letter from the Na-tional PTA strongly\u2014strongly\u2014oppos-ing the Frist-Ashcroft amendment: The National PTA supports Sens. Ashcroft's and Frist's goal of keeping chil-dren safe in school. Their amendment, how-ever, would allow for the expulsion of special education students who possess a handgun in school, without ensuring alternative edu-cation services are provided. National PTA supports removing students who bring guns to school, but believes students should re-ceive education services in an alternative setting. National PTA supports Senator Harkin's amendment, which clarifies that schools have the authority to remove any child who brings a gun to school [and continues to pro-vide them services]. I ask unanimous consent the Na- tional PTA letter be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: NATIONAL PTA, Chicago, IL, May 17, 1999. U.S. S ENATE , Washington, DC. DEAR SENATOR : National PTA opposes amending the Individuals with Disability Education Act (IDEA) as proposed by Sens. Ashcroft and Frist. The amendment will be offered to S. 254, the juvenile justice bill cur-rently being debated in the Senate. National PTA asks that you vote NO on Ashcroft/Frist amendment and vote YES to support an al-ternative amendment sponsored by Senator Harkin. The National PTA supports Sens. Ashcroft's and Frist's goal of keeping chil-dren safe in school. Their amendment, would allow for the expulsion of special education students who possess a handgun on school, without ensuring alternative education serv-ices are provided. National PTA supports re-moving students who bring guns to school, but believes students should receive edu- cation services in an alternative setting. National PTA supports Senator Harkin's amendment, which clarifies that schools have the authority to remove any child who brings a gun to school. The amendment also states that all students should be provided education services in an alternative setting. Further, students would receive immediate and appropriate intervention services, and thereby minimize the possibility of future violations by the student. The National PTA asks that you oppose the Ashcroft/Frist amendment and vote for the Harkin alternative. Sincerely, S HIRLEY IGO, Vice President for Legislation. Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have a number of other organizations whose letters in opposition to this amend-ment I want to print in the R ECORD : the United Cerebral Palsy Association, Learning Disabilities Association of America, the ARC of the United States, the American Association of Mental Retardation, the Easter Seals of Mis-souri, the Easter Seals of Tennessee, and a number of others. I ask unani-mous consent they be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: THECOUNCIL FOR EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN , Reston VA, May 17, 1999. Hon. J OHNASCROFT , U.S. Senate, Washington DC. DEARSENATOR ASHCROFT , On behalf of all students in special education and general education, we ask you to withdraw your amendment to the Individuals with Disabil-ities Education Act Amendments of 1997 (IDEA 1997). Amendment No. 348 would seri-ously jeopardize the integrity of this historic piece of legislation. While we at the Council for Exceptional Children strongly support the removal of a student who endangers the safety or well- being of themselves or other students, we strongly oppose the cessation of services for any student. Past incidents, such as the tragic story of Kip Kinkle from Springfield, Oregon, prove that when a student is imme-diately suspended without any type of serv-ice, further tragedy is imminent. The final IDEA regulations, released March 12, 1999, offer schools substantial op-portunities and strategies for addressing problem behavior of students with disabil-ities including behavior that is dangerous or involves drugs or weapons. When it is stated that children with disabilities cannot be dis-ciplined, that is absolutely not the case. The statute and the regulations clearly state that when the behavior is not a manifesta-tion of their disability, those children can be disciplined in the same manner as children without disabilities. Furthermore, the stat-ute and regulations state that a child who commits an offense involving drugs or weap-ons that is a manifestation of their dis-ability, the child can be removed from the classroom and/or building for up to 45 days. There is nothing in the statute or regula-tions that prohibit another 45 day removal if that is appropriate. The only difference is that child will receive educational services. This amendment will not result in safer schools or communities. In fact, every major law enforcement agency reports that expel-ling or suspending troubled children without education services only increases juvenile crime. Drop out rates, incarceration rates and drug use rates also increase when chil- dren are expelled or suspended without edu-cation services. On the other hand, we support Senator Harkin's amendment to the juvenile justice legislation which is presently being debated. The Harkin amendment, not an amendment to IDEA, clarifies that schools can and should remove children who bring guns to school and that schools should provide them with immediate appropriate intervention and services, including mental health serv-ices in order to maximize the likelihood that such child does not engage in such behavior or such behavior does not reoccur. The Har-kin Amendment also reaffirms that nothing prohibits a school from reporting a crime to appropriate authorities. Please reconsider your amendment and the negative effect it will have to the carefully constructed IDEA Amendments of 1997. We need to implement IDEA, not amend it. Your amendment will seriously undermine the benefits and protections of IDEA. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, B. J OSEPH BALLARD , Associate Executive Director. MISSOURI PLANNING COUNCIL FORDEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES , Jefferson City, MO, May 17, 1999. Hon. J OHNASHCROFT , Russell Senate Office Building Washington, DC. D EARSENATOR ASHCROFT : On behalf of the Missouri Planning Council for Develop-mental Disabilities, I am writing this letter to support the Harkin Amendment to the Ju-venile Justice Bill. We believe this bill will result in safer schools since it clarifies the schools' roles in removing children who bring guns to school. We also support the provision of intervention and services, in-cluding mental health services, to reduce the possibility of such behaviors reoccurring. We have supported IDEA, formerly the Education for All Handicapped Children's Act of 1975, since it was introduced and be-lieve that because of this strong legislation many children are now receiving the edu-cation to which they are entitled. Because of this we cannot support legislation that would weaken this most important special education law. Thank you for the opportunity to provide comment. Please call our office if you have questions. Sincerely, D ONJACKSON , Chairman. EASTER SEALS , May 17, 1999. Hon. J OHNASHCROFT , U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. D EAR SENATOR ASHCROFT : On behalf of Easter Seals Missouri, I write to you today to inform you of our opposition to your leg-islation, the School Safety Act. While proposed as a solution to the rising problem of violence in our schools, this legis-lation will only contribute to juvenile crime in our communities. Simply removing a child from school does little to address long- term behavioral problems. In fact, suspen-sions and expulsions without education serv-ices only transfer the problem from the school setting to the community setting. Parents of children with disabilities want safe schools. They know that their children are too often the victims of inappropriate conduct. Under the 1997 amendments to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, any truly dangerous child can and should be readily removed by school authorities. More-over, the 1997 amendments add numerous VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5687 May 20, 1999 new discipline provisions that strengthen the ability of school personnel to maintain a safe and orderly environment, conducive to learn-ing. Easter Seals Missouri urges you to with- draw the Safe Schools Act. Thank you for considering our views. Sincerely, P ATRICIA JONES , President and CEO. NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STATE BOARDS OF EDUCATION , Alexandria, VA, May 19, 1999. U.S. S ENATE , Washington, DC. DEAR SENATOR : The National Association of State Boards of Education (NASBE) is a private nonprofit association representing state and territorial boards of education. Our principal objectives are to strengthen state leadership in education policymaking, pro-mote excellence in the education of all stu-dents, advocate equality of access to edu-cational opportunity, and assure responsible governance of public education. NASBE would like to express its opposi- tion to an amendment proposed by Senators Ashcroft and Frist that will significantly alter the discipline provisions within the In-dividuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which will be considered by the Sen-ate during debate on the Juvenile Justice bill S. 254 this morning. Currently, students with disabilities who bring a weapon to school can be shifted to an alternative set-ting for up to 45 days. The Ashcroft/Frist amendment would change this policy so that students with disabilities could be expelled for an entire year. While we certainly sup-port strict disciplinary measures for all stu-dents, we must oppose this proposal on the following grounds: Cessation of educational services, particu- larly to those most in need of intervention, is not an appropriate response. Simply re-moving the offending student from school merely shifts the problem to the neighbor-hood and streets surrounding the school. A weapons offense is best handled by law enforcement and the judicial system. The current IDEA law does not preclude school personnel from referring student violations to the police where state and local laws would apply. The amendment undermines the com- prehensive compromise reached on IDEA in 1997, of which the current disciplinary poli-cies were a major consideration. During the final Senate vote on IDEA, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott warned that any attempt to modify the legislation would cause the agreement to collapse. Changes made now would only encourage others to attempt to revise other sections of the carefully crafted IDEA law in the future. Again, we urge you to oppose changing the IDEA disciplinary provisions under the Ashcroft/Frist amendment to the Juvenile Justice bill. If you have any questions, please have your staff contact David Grif-fith, Director of Governmental Affairs, at 703/684-4000, ext. 107. Thank you for your con-sideration.

BRYANT : The Arc of the United States is very concerned with your May 17 letter to Members of the U.S. Senate, in which you state that the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (P.L. 105-17) pre-vents schools from removing students who bring firearms to school. This statement is totally incorrect and very misleading. The newly-reauthorized I.D.E.A. allows school authorities to immediately remove all chil-dren, including children with disabilities, from the school setting for any violation of school discipline codes for up to ten days. In cases when a child has brought a weapon to school or school function, school authorities can unilaterally remove a child with a dis-ability from the child's regular placement for up to 45 days at a time. In addition, if school officials believe that it would be dan-gerous to return the child after the 45 day period, they can ask an impartial hearing of-ficer to order that the child remain in the in- terim alternative setting for an additional 45 days and can request subsequent extensions. It is incomprehensible to The Arc why the National School Boards Association would want to mislead the Senate about this im-portant civil rights law. As a result of these misperceptions, the Senate is considering an amendment to I.D.E.A. that would make communities more dangerous, not safer. The Frist/Ashcroft Amendment currently being debated as part of the Juvenile Justice legis-lation (S. 254) would allow schools to cease educational services to children with disabil-ities. Every major law enforcement agency reports that expelling or suspending troubled children without educational services only increases juvenile crime. Drop out rates, in-carceration rates and drug use rates also in-crease when children are expelled or sus-pended without educational services. The current I.D.E.A. law and the final reg- ulations, just released by the Department of Education in March of this year, already pro-vide adequate protections to schools. The new law, which your organization agreed to, should be given a chance to work. I.D.E.A. has provided millions of students with dis-abilities the opportunity for a free and ap-propriate public education enabling them to become independent and productive citizens. The Arc is extremely disturbed that your or-ganization would use children with disabil-ities as the scapegoat for recent school shootings. Sincerely, B RENDA DOSS, President. NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF BLACK LAWENFORCEMENT EXECUTIVES , Alexandria, VA, May 18, 1999. Hon. T OMHARKIN , U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. D EAR SENATOR HARKIN : On behalf of the National Organization of Black Law Enforce-ment Executives (NOBLE), this letter is to support your substitute amendment to S. 254. NOBLE represents more than 3000 minor-ity law enforcement managers, executives, and practitioners at the local, state and fed-eral levels. We believe that students who are suspended from school for carrying weapons must be placed in a supervised alternative to school and be required to participate in an appropriate mental health and behavioral modification program. Suspending these stu-dents from school and putting them out onto the streets would only serve to magnify the crime problem that currently exists. Your ef-forts to ensure that this does not happen are strongly supported by NOBLE. Our organization urges you to continue your efforts to ensure that your substitute amendment is incorporated into S. 254. Sincerely, R OBERT L. S TEWART , Executive Director. THESECRETARY OF EDUCATION , Washington, DC, May 17, 1999. Hon. T OMDASCHLE , U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. D EAR SENATOR DASCHLE : I am writing to express my strong opposition to an amend-ment that Senator Frist has offered to S. 254, the juvenile crime bill that the Senate is now considering. This amendment, which is similar to S. 969, Senator Ashcroft's bill to which I expressed my opposition last week, would allow school personnel to suspend or expel children with disabilities from their schools for unlimited periods of time, with-out any educational services, including be-havioral intervention services, and without the impartial hearing now required by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), for carrying or possessing a gun or other firearm to, or at, a school function. The Congress need not address the par- ticular issue that is the subject of the Frist amendment, because it amended the IDEA just two years ago to give school officials new tools to address the precise issue of chil-dren with disabilities bringing weapons to school or otherwise threatening teachers and other students. For example, school officials may remove, for up to 45 days, a child with a disability who takes a weapon to school, and may request a hearing officer to simi-larly remove a child who is substantially likely to injure himself or others, if the child's parents object to a change in the child's placement. Furthermore, the IDEA allows hearing officers to keep these stu-dents out of the regular educational environ-ment beyond 45 days if they continue to pose a threat to the rest of the student body. I am convinced that these new tools will be effec-tive if given a chance to work. I am firmly committed to ensuring that all our schools are safe and disciplined environ-ments where all our children, including chil-dren with disabilities, can learn without fear of violence. But we should not let the tragic school shootings in Littleton, Colorado, and other communities lead us to responses, such as the Frist amendment, that will harm chil-dren with disabilities. First, the Frist amendment would deny vital educational services to children with disabilities who are removed from school, in-cluding behavioral interventions that are de-signed to prevent dangerous behavior from recurring. Continued provision of edu-cational services, including these behavioral interventions, offers the best chance for im-proving the long-term prospects for these children. Discontinuing educational services is the wrong decision in the short run and, in the long run, will result in significant costs in terms of increased crime, dependency on public assistance, unemployment, and alien-ation from society. We cannot afford to throw away a single child. Second, the Frist amendment would undo vital protections in the IDEA that were in-cluded to protect children with disabilities from widespread abuses of their civil rights. Under this amendment, for example, the IDEA would no longer require schools to de-termine, when suspending or expelling a child with a disability, whether the behavior of the child in carrying or possessing a fire-arm is related to the child's disability. Such a determination, which can currently be made while the child has been removed from school, is needed to ensure that children are not unjustly denied educational services dur-ing their removal without considering the ef-fects of the child's disability on their behav-ior. The manifestation determination re-quired by the IDEA is an important tool schools use to appropriately understand the relationship between a child's behavior and their disability in order to best implement behavior intervention strategies. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5688 May 20, 1999 We should be making every effort to appro- priately reach out to our children and help prevent them from endangering themselves and others. It is equally important that we appropriately address the needs of children who have gone astray, violated the rules, and put others at risk. The exclusion of children with disabilities from school\u2014without the impartial due-process hearing and the con-tinued services that the IDEA now requires\u2014 is the wrong response. I urge you to vote against the Frist amend- ment. The Office of Management and Budget ad- vises that there is no objection to the sub-mission of this report from the standpoint of the Administration's program. Yours sincerely, R ICHARD W. R ILEY. STATE OF TENNESSEE , DEPARTMENT OFMENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL RETARDATION , D EVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES COUNCIL , Nashville, TN, May 17, 1999. Senator B ILLFRIST, Dirksen Building Washington, DC. D EAR SENATOR FRIST: The recent path of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) has been an arduous one, as you well know. We at the Tennessee Develop-mental Disabilities Council and many oth-ers, especially parents of students with dis-abilities and the students themselves, re-member your outstanding efforts to achieve a fair compromise around complex issues during the recent IDEA reauthorization process. Because of your interest and atten-tion, IDEA still ensures children with dis-abilities access to a free appropriate public education. The procedural safeguards contained in IDEA are critical in protecting the right of children with disabilities to receive a free appropriate public education. Therefore, we are distressed about your recent effort to amend IDEA concerning the suspension or expulsion of students with disabilities who carries or possesses a gun or firearm to or at a school, on school premises, or to or at a school function. This is not to say that we believe that any student who carries or pos-sesses a gun or firearm should not be dis-ciplined. Just as the positive principles of the IDEA should work for all students as schools are encouraged to include students with disabilities in regular classrooms and to afford them every opportunity for education, so should such egregious behavior by any student have consequences. However, we do not believe that the con- sequences enumerated by your amendment to IDEA will have the desired outcome. They will not result in safer schools or commu-nities. In fact, every major law enforcement agency reports that expelling or suspending troubled children without education services only increases juvenile crime. Drop out rates, incarceration rates and drug use rates also increase when children are expelled or suspended without educational services. We believe that a better approach, for all students, is articulated in Senator Harkin's amendment to the juvenile justice bill. It will assist schools to maintain safe environ-ments conducive to learning. It clarifies that schools can and should remove children who bring guns to school and that schools should provide them with immediate appropriate intervention and services including mental health services to maximize the likelihood that such child does not engage in such be-havior or such behavior does not reoccur. The Harkin amendment also reaffirms that nothing prohibits a school from reporting a crime to appropriate authorities. Senator Harkin's amendment seems very consistent with the aim of IDEA and with the very compromise that you worked so hard to achieve in 1997. Therefore, we ask that you support Senator Harkin's amend-ment. Sincerely, L ANAKILE, Chair. WANDA WILLIS , Executive Director. AMERICAN ASSOCIATION ONMENTAL RETARDATION , Executive Director. Re: Opposition to IDEA Amendments. Date: May 17, 1999. Thank you for all your hard work to main- tain the integrity of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Your ef-forts are greatly appreciated by the members of the American Association on Mental Re-tardation! We also want you to know that we oppose the Ashcroft/Frist Amendment because we do not believe it will result in safer schools or communities. Drop out rates, crime, in-carceration and drug use increases when children are expelled or suspended from school without education services. Clearly, such suspensions or expulsions are not in our society's best interest. Your proposed amendment to the juvenile justice legislation rather than to IDEA seems to be a sensible approach and we sup-port it. Please share our support with your col- leagues and, again, thank you for all work on behalf of children with disabilities. LEARNING DISABILITIES ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA , Pittsburgh, PA, May 17, 1999. DEAR SENATOR : As President of LOA, the Learning Disabilities Association of Amer-ica, a national non-profit volunteer organiza-tion dedicated to a world in which all indi-viduals with learning disabilities thrive and participate fully in society, I ask you on be-half of all children with disabilities to: Oppose the Ashcroft/Frist Amendment to the Mental Health Juvenile Justice Act (S254) now being debated on the Senate floor. This amendment, which would allow local schools to deny educational services, includ-ing special education, to a child with a dis-ability who carries to or possesses a gun or firearm in school or a school function, would not reduce violence in schools and society. Testimony of law enforcement agencies dur-ing the IDEA reauthorization process point-ed out that expelling or suspending troubled children without educational services results in increased juvenile crime in the short term and increased drop out rates, incarceration rates, and drug use in the long term. Support the Harkin Amendment to the Mental Health Juvenile Justice Act (S254) which clarifies that, under IDEA 97, school can and should remove students with disabil-ities who bring guns to school. Moreover after being in an alternative educational placement for up to 45 days, the IEP team may decide to move the child to a placement other than the school in which the infraction occurred. The Harkin Amendment also reaf-firms that nothing in IDEA prohibits a school from reporting a crime to appropriate authorities. I would like to point out that none of the children responsible for the eight school tragedies in the past two years was a special education student being served under IDEA. However, it is also apparent that appropriate mental health interventions might have pre-vented some of these tragedies. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, H ARRY SYLVESTER , President. Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining? The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 7 seconds. Mr. HARKIN. I have used up 14 min- utes? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator is correct. Mr. HARKIN. I reserve the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Tennessee. Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield myself 8 minutes. This will be the last few minutes that I have to speak on the Frist-Ashcroft amendment and, thus, I want to, for the sake of my colleagues and others who are listening, explain what the amendment is about. This amendment is very simple. It is about two things: No. 1, the safety of all students; and No. 2, equal treat-ment of children. I have a letter from the National School Boards Association. As most people know, it represents 95,000 local school board members. I will read from the first paragraph of the letter: On behalf of the Nation's 95,000 local school board members, the National School Boards Association urges you to support the Frist- Ashcroft amendment to S. 254 that would en-hance the safety of all students from gun vi-olence. The amendment provides school offi-cials with the discretion to suspend or expel students covered by the Individuals with Dis-abilities Education Act in the same manner as other students in cases where they bring firearms to school. My colleagues, this amendment is about the safety of all students and the equal treatment of children. Yesterday, we had a very good de- bate, I thought, on the substance of the amendment. I gave my remarks yester-day, and I wish to also refer today to some statistics that I obtained not too long ago from my own county, David-son County. For the 1997-1998 school year there were eight children in my home county who brought either a gun or a bomb to school, eight in that 1 year. Of those eight, six were special education stu-dents. What happened? The two who were not special education students, because of the zero tolerance policy in Tennessee, were expelled. They were out for the remainder of the year. Of the six special education students, three were back in class. These are in-dividuals who brought a bomb or a gun into the classroom already. Three of them were kept out of school. Why? Because their disability and bringing a gun to school were unre-lated. But three of the eight had this manifestation process, and because of the disability, they were treated in a special way and allowed back into the classroom. Yesterday I was caught a little off guard, and I do not like that, I really do not like that. And I do not think the VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5689 May 20, 1999 Senator from Iowa meant to say what he said. But he said those statistics don't count. And then I said, well, let's look at 1999, He said, no those statis-tics don't count. And I said Why? And he said basically because the regula-tions just came out and we fixed that loophole. That bothered me, so what I did was go back and call to see really when this law took place, the law that is oper-ating today. I found something very different, exactly the opposite of what the Senator from Iowa told all of his colleagues. And I want to straighten that out for the R ECORD . It is very, very important. The Senator from Iowa argued yes- terday that the statistics where indi-viduals with disabilities ended up back in the classroom within 45 days of hav-ing brought a gun to the schoolroom don't apply and that loophole had been fixed. I found something very, very dif-ferent. In fact, the IDEA amendments of 1997 were signed into law on June 4, 1997. The Senator from Iowa and I were both there. It was a good day. We were both there. Yes, the regulations were writ-ten. And it really took too long, they just came out a few months ago. The implication yesterday by the Senator from Iowa was that they were written only recently and, therefore, so they could not apply. In looking a little closer, the IDEA amendments were signed into law on June 4, 1997. And on June 4, 1997, sec-tion 615, the discipline provisions, went into effect that day. So every statistic that I have given for the last 2 years shows repetitively individuals with dis-abilities, because of this special treat-ment, it is not their fault, it is the fault of the law that they are ending up back in the classroom. These are indi-viduals who brought a gun or a bomb to school. Again, I was very disappointed, be- cause again and again he said on the floor yesterday and I went back to the R ECORD again last night and found that the Senator from Iowa said: ''I say to the Senator from Tennessee, that the school he is talking about was still op-erating under the old system.'' Not true. Not true. We talked to the director of high schools for Nashville, Davidson County, and the director stated very specifically that every school in the Davidson County was op-erating under the IDEA amendments of 1997 under advisement of their lawyers. In fact, let me read from the bill that we signed last year. The 1997-1998 school year applied on June 4. This is from the bill that we signed on a great day, on June 4, 1997. It says: ''Effective dates, these shall take effect upon enactment of this act,'' on that day in June 1997. So all the statistics of eight individ- uals were relevant. Two were expelled because they did not have a disability and of the six who had a disability, three were back in the classroom with-in 45 days. That is the loophole. Why am I concerned? Just because some- body has not been killed yet because of this loophole, I am not going to wait around until somebody has been killed. I want to prevent that from happening. This amendment is about the safety of all students and to have all students treated fairly. The amendment closes the loophole that I just pointed out. I have dem-onstrated factually it is occurring in this legislation. So I want to dismiss all of the arguments the Senator from Iowa made yesterday when he said it is not a problem. This amendment will, in its ultimate passage, end the mixed message that the Federal Government, that we in this body, send to American students on the issue of guns in school. Under IDEA, a student with a dis- ability who is in possession of a fire-arm at school is treated differently from anybody else. Our amendment says very simply that if you bring a gun or a firearm to the school, you, as a student, are going to be treated the same, and you are going to be treated by the local principal or other authori-ties in the school. Our amendment allows principals or other qualified school personnel the flexibility to treat every student who brings a gun or a firearm or a bomb into the classroom the very same. Our amendment does not enforce any sort of uniform policy. We might like to think that we in Washington can set good school policy, but this shows how dangerous that can be by trying to set a uniform policy here for some subset of students. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Tennessee has used 8 min-utes. Mr. FRIST. I yield myself 1 more minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the amendment is a simple amendment: Equal treatment for each and every student who brings a firearm, a gun or bomb, to school. It is an amendment which will have an impact, I believe, help individuals in terms of safety in our schools. The amendment closes a loophole, a loophole that I have definitively dem-onstrated does occur in our schools. If a student brings a gun to school, they, if our amendment is agreed to, will be treated the same regardless of their educational status. Mr. President, I reserve the remain- der of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Missouri. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator has 6 minutes 18 seconds remain-ing. Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his leadership on this issue. I began to be concerned about students car-rying guns in and out of our schools quite some time ago. On the Ed-Flex bill, which passed this Senate just a couple months ago, I put an amend-ment to close another loophole which would allow students who possessed guns in school\u2014not just carried guns to school\u2014to be removed from the school environment. This responsibility for us to close these loopholes is a serious one. It is a responsibility that relates to school safety. That is what we are talking about here. School safety is a responsi-bility that we can work hard on, and I am glad Senator F RIST of Tennessee and I have been able to join on this amendment. It should not have taken this long. This is a simple amendment. This amendment merely allows local schools to treat all children who bring guns to school in the same manner. It does not target children with disabil-ities\u2014simply not so. It protects chil-dren with disabilities. This is not a matter of scapegoating. This does not say that any group of students is sub-ject to more severe punishments than any other group of students. This is a bill that provides for equity, simply saying that principals and su-perintendents should have the power, without interference from the Federal Government, to remove students from school who come to school with a fire-arm, an explosive or a gun. I believe we need to make sure we close the loop-hole in the Federal law that made it very difficult to discipline certain stu-dents who came in that setting. There are those who say: Well, the law is this way and the law is that way. And they will argue about how the law is applied here in the Senate Chamber. We have a lot of experience from around the country about how the law is applied in the schools. The Senator from Tennessee has eloquently spoken to the fact that as applied in the schools, you frequently find that indi-viduals who, if they were not the sub-ject of an individualized education pro-gram, would be gone for a year because of a mandated expulsion, are back in the classroom within 45 days, in spite of the fact that they brought a gun or a bomb to school. It is simply our intention to let local school boards and school officials de-cide how they should be able to make the school a safe place and not to re-insert a student in the school environ-ment who has threatened the safety and security of the school by bringing a bomb or a gun to school. We must have zero tolerance for guns in school. I think we must let school officials de-cide on discipline policies. We should not have taken this long on this amendment, but I am glad that we are at this point. After we vote on this amendment, there is a consent decree which is going to allow the Harkin amendment to be voted on. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator has 3 minutes remaining. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5690 May 20, 1999 Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes of the remain-ing 3 and ask to be notified. The Harkin amendment makes the current law even worse by imposing a new requirement upon schools that they couldn't remove any child for bringing a gun to school unless they provide special services to the child. I will oppose this amendment. When you tell people that you will make them special for bringing a gun to school, I think you do a great dis-service. You are not making victims out of people by pulling them out of school. You are not making them un-safe. If you tell them clearly that if they bring a gun to school that they are not going to be allowed to stay in school, you will make them safer, and you will make the school safer. This is a school safety issue. It is an issue that requires our attention. The simple fact of the matter is, the cur-rent law, as applied and as imple-mented, is a real impediment to school safety. There will be arguments that we have yet to have a student shoot some-one under these circumstances. I can tell you that we have come very close. I talked to one school superintendent in my State who had such a student threaten seven other students in the classroom, to kill them. When the stu-dent finally shot one of the other stu-dents, it wasn't in the classroom. It was off the school premises so that it really didn't qualify under IDEA. But we don't have to wait until there is blood on the blackboard or on the floor of the classroom in order to take steps to make sure we don't have guns in the classroom. The truth of the matter is, we should simply and clearly make it possible on an equal footing to say that no matter who the student is, there are no ex-cuses, there are no special exceptions; if you bring a gun to school, the local school authority should have the op-portunity to take that student and to remove that student without regard to other status. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator's time has expired. Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I re- serve the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Iowa. Mr. HARKIN. How much time re- mains? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator has 1 minute 4 seconds. Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself the remainder of my time. There is no loophole here. The equity they keep talking about is an equity for danger. We keep hearing they are for safety in schools. We all are for safety, of course. Why is the National PTA opposed to this amendment? Why are 500 police leaders around the country opposed to this amendment? Why is the National Association of the State Boards of Edu-cation opposed to this amendment? Be-cause they all know that the amend-ment we are about to vote on is a rec- ipe for disaster. It will increase crime. It will in- crease drug use. It will increase the dropout rate. Why? I am really dis-appointed that anyone would say that we can take these kids who have severe problems, kick them out of school and cut off all supporting services and make communities safer. The police chiefs who have to deal with the after-math know better. That is why they are opposed to this amendment. We know more than they do, and the Par-ent Teacher Association? Why are they opposed to the Ashcroft-Frist amend-ment? Because they realize it is a for-mula for disaster. That is what it is. This is a dangerous, dangerous amendment and I strongly urge my col-leagues to vote against it. Mr. President, after the vote on this amendment\u2014by unanimous consent\u2014 the Senate will adopt the Harkin amendment. This is an amendment I have drafted and is cosponsored by the distinguished ranking member of the HELP committee, Senator K ENNEDY . Our amendment is supported by the po-lice and other groups who oppose the Frist-Ashcroft amendment because it would make schools and communities safer. I'd like to say a few words about it and its intent. Passage of our amendment is very important. It is very important, be-cause it requires that all children\u2014 whether they have a disability or not\u2014 are not just dumped in the streets after they commit an act of violence, includ-ing bringing a gun or firearm to school. Our amendment would require that schools provide immediate and appro-priate supervision, tracking, edu-cational, behavioral, health and re-lated services to these children in order to reduce the likelihood that the child will repeat their anti-social and dan-gerous behavior. The interventions would be tailored to the individual child. This is absolutely critical and is demonstrated to actually make a dif-ference. It will save lives and money in the long run. It makes common sense. The Harkin amendment also author- izes the funds necessary to assist our schools in providing this critical inter-vention. So passage of the Harkin-Kennedy amendment\u2014which will occur by voice vote after this roll call vote on the Frist-Ashcroft amendment\u2014is a very important amendment. Its adoption puts the Senate on record as sup-porting the recommendations and pleas of the police, parents and teachers. Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Frist-Ashcroft amendment pertaining to the Individ-uals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA. I respect my colleagues' inten-tions. They want to make schools safer. Their amendment would not make schools safer, nor the sidewalks leading to the schools, nor their com-munities. Their amendment would allow a child with a disability caught with a gun or a firearm, whether he knew what he was doing or not, to be suspended or expelled without educational services. If a child with a disability\u2014if any child for that matter\u2014is suspended or expelled for having a gun or firearm in school and subsequently not provided with educational services and adult su-pervision\u2014Would schools be safer? Would communities be safer? Given what happened outside of Atlanta today, we must shift the debate. Yes-terday, our colleagues from Tennessee, Missouri, and Iowa debated if, and for how long, a child with a disability could be removed from his school if he brought a firearm to school. I think they agreed that under IDEA and under the Frist-Ashcroft amendment a child with a disability could be removed from his school. The crux of the remaining disagree- ment was services\u2014why a child with a disability who brings a gun to school should get services, while his peer without a disability in the same situa-tion, would not get services. We don't solve anything by kicking any child out of school without educational serv-ices. There are two letters of opposition to the Frist-Ashcroft on your desk. One is from the National Association of State Boards of Education and one from the National Parent Teacher Association. They make that simple point very well. Ask yourself this question\u2014If you could prevent a child from committing a violent act for the first time or a sec-ond time, by providing appropriate services, what would you do? The an-swer is obvious. You would provide the services\u2014to make your school safe, to make your community safe, but most importantly, to save the child. In the rare instances when it occurs, IDEA provides schools with the tools to control and prevent gun and firearm use by children with disabilities. IDEA recognizes and promotes school safety. IDEA recognizes and promotes teach-ing consequences for wrongful behav-ior. IDEA recognizes and promotes adult supervision of, engagement with, and responsibility for children who break school rules or criminal laws. I would like to review some key facts about IDEA. IDEA permits school offi-cials to immediately suspend a child with a disability with a gun or firearm for 10 days without educational serv-ices. During that time, a manifestation determination review must be con-ducted. First, to determine if the child with a disability understood the im-pact and consequences of having a gun or firearm. Second, to determine if the child's disability did or did not impair the child's ability to control his behav-ior. In effect, if the child knew what he was doing, the law allows the child to be disciplined in the same manner as other children caught with guns or firearms. One distinction applies. This child with a disability, perhaps unlike his peers, would continue to receive educational services. However, school VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5691 May 20, 1999 officials have total discretion over the details associated with providing these educational services. If a manifestation determination re- view establishes that the child did not know what he was doing, the child could still be removed from his class-room and school and placed in an in-terim alternative educational setting for 45 days. After 45 days, if the child continued to be dangerous, the child's placement in the interim alternative educational setting could be extended with the concurrence of a hearing offi-cer. In the wake of the tragedy in Little- ton, Colorado, in the wake of Atlanta, hearing officers will give substantial deference to claims from school offi-cials that a child with disabilities con-tinues to be dangerous. Concurrence of a hearing officer at 45 day intervals is a reasonable standard and an appro-priate check and balance on the contin-ued use of an interim alternative edu-cational setting. There is no forum or procedures for due process in the Frist-Ashcroft amendment. How is a child with a dis-ability to prove his innocence? If ex-pelled without education services for 12 months, what will be the impact on the child's family? What will be the reac-tion of the child's next teacher? What will be the impact on the child's neigh-borhood? What will be the impact on this child as an adult? The real driving force behind the Frist-Ashcroft amendment is the obli-gation to provide services, and not school safety. Local school districts do not want the responsibility for paying for new services. If school districts do not now have interim alternative edu-cational settings that can accommo-date children with disabilities, they do not want to spend money to create them. If school districts do not now have home-based programs or alter-native school programs, they want ad-ditional money to have them. School districts do not see a windfall of new Federal dollars on the horizon. So in the name of school safety, they bless the Frist-Ashcroft amendment. In the name of school safety, school dis-tricts say it is acceptable for Federal policy to close the school house door on the back of a child with a disability, whether the child knew why the door slammed shut or not. In the name of school safety, they say it is acceptable for Federal policy to leave open wheth-er any agency gives the child and the child's family help, so that they can re-cover from a gun or firearm episode that profoundly altered their lives. Helping children and their families in these situations is a community re-sponsibility. Schools are part of com-munities. They must do their part. Other agencies and organizations must do their part. To abdicate responsi-bility or shift responsibility is not ac-ceptable. It makes no sense. All parents want their children to be safe in school and out. All parents want their children to have due process when they are accused of wrong doing. All parents want their child's edu-cation to continue, even if their child did wrong. Are we going to disregard some of America's most vulnerable children in the name of political expediency, by pretending that the Frist-Ashcroft amendment will make schools and communities safer. In an ideal world, we would find a way to work together to develop or ex-pand, and fund, local agencies and or-ganizations that would work collabo-ratively to assist families and children in crisis, so that the crisis does not re-occur. In an ideal world, teachers and ad- ministrators in America's schools would be thoroughly versed in the re-ferral procedures associated with IDEA; and, if IDEA were fully funded, tragedies with guns and firearms could be prevented. We don't have an ideal world, but we must try to make a positive difference, one day at a time, especially in the lives of children. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator's time has expired. The Senator from Missouri. Mr. ASHCROFT. I yield myself such time as I have remaining. Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa indicates there is not a loophole here. Well, it is strange to me, but the sta-tistics indicate otherwise. One county in Tennessee, clear evi- dence, Davidson County, the home of the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. F RIST, four people who squeezed through the nonexistent loophole were back in class within 45 days in that setting. I think we have to make sure that that nonexistent loophole, if that is what we are talking about, gets closed. It is impossible to have people coming through a door that is not there. There is a loophole that needs to be shut. Last but not least, it is no accident that the National School Boards Asso-ciation wants us to pass this. This isn't discriminating against one class of stu-dents or in favor of another. It simply says our priority for learning has to be a safe and secure school environment. This particular amendment would en-hance the safety of all students from gun violence, according to the National School Boards Association. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, in our amendment, which we just passed in the Senate, Senator F RIST and I pro- posed important changes to federal law to give schools more authority to re-move from the classroom any student who brings a gun or firearm to school. Schools need current federal barriers removed so that they can preserve a safe and secure classroom for our chil-dren. The Senator from Iowa has proposed an amendment which makes it even more difficult for schools to remove any dangerous student\u2014including one who brings a gun to school\u2014from the classroom. I rise to state my opposi-tion to the Harkin amendment. The Harkin amendment makes the current law even worse by imposing a new requirement upon schools when they desire to remove any child\u2014dis-abled or non-disabled\u2014from the class-room for bringing a gun or firearm to school, or for committing any act of vi-olence. The Harkin amendment takes the un- precedented step of telling schools across the country that if they want to remove any child from school\u2014even a nondisabled student\u2014for possessing a weapon, or for committing any act of violence, schools must provide the child with ''immediate appropriate interventions and services, including mental health interventions and serv-ices,'' in order to ''maximize the likeli-hood that such child shall not engage in such behaviors, or such behaviors do not reoccur.'' This amendment would overturn the discipline policies of schools across the nation, and intrude upon the right of parents, teachers, school administra-tors, school boards, to set their own discipline policies regarding weapons and violence in schools. Not only this, but it jeopardizes the ability of schools to remove any student from class who has a gun or firearm, and prevents them from keeping their schools safe. The Harkin amendment would also handcuff schools even more than the current IDEA law does regarding re-moval of disabled students who possess weapons. The Harkin amendment says that a school that takes action to remove a child with a weapon from school ''shall ensure that immediate appropriate interventions and services, including mental health interventions and serv-ices,'' are provided to the child. This is a new requirement in addition to cur-rent IDEA law. Current IDEA law requires that a school that removes a child from the regular classroom for 45 days for a weapons possession must already con-duct a series of procedures in connec-tion with the removal. Let me describe some of these procedures. First, a school must conduct a func- tional behavioral assessment. Second, it must implement or modify a behav-ioral intervention plan for the child. Included in this is the requirement that the IEP team must meet to de-velop or modify an assessment plan to address the behavior at issue. Third, the school must conduct a manifesta-tion determination review to deter-mine if the child's disability caused the behavior at issue. The Harkin amendment adds yet an- other requirement to the list of proce-dures that a school must undertake when removing a child with a weapon from the classroom, by requiring that schools ''ensure that immediate appro-priate intervention and services, in-cluding mental health interventions and services,'' are provided to the child. Why do we need to handcuff schools even more with another proce-dure? Additionally, the amendment says that these additional interventions and services must be provided ''in order to maximize the likelihood that such child will not engage in such behaviors, or such behaviors do not reoccur.'' We are not simply asking the schools to try to reduce the likelihood of reoccur-ring behavior: we are requiring them to maximize that likelihood. School principals, administrators, teachers, school boards, and parents have told me about how difficult the current IDEA makes it to discipline students, and especially in the case of guns and firearms. Senator H ARKIN 's amendment adds yet another layer of procedure. Rather than providing schools with more au-thority to take actions school officials deem appropriate to maintain a safe and secure classroom free from guns and firearms, Senator H ARKIN 's amend- ment is going backwards from current law by imposing more federal respon- sibilities. The Harkin amendment's attempt to provide funding for the new procedures required under the amendment is dis-ingenuous. The amendment authorizes ''such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2000 through 2004'' to pay for the ''interventions and serv-ices'' that schools must conduct before they can remove a student with a gun from school. If the Senator from Iowa and others were unwilling to vote for giving schools more IDEA funding dur-ing debate on the ed-flex bill earlier this session, what makes us think they really would provide more funding at this time? In conclusion, the Harkin amend- ment actually makes current law worse by imposing a new set of require-ments on schools when they need to re-move any child with a firearm from the classroom. He would require schools to provide ''interventions and services'' to non-disabled students who are expelled for bringing a gun to school. And, he imposes a new requirement upon schools that take action to remove IDEA students from school for weapons possession. At a time when parents, teachers, school officials, and our children are asking for help in keeping our class-rooms safe, we cannot afford to take a step backward and further handcuff schools from taking steps to get guns out of schools. We need to move for-ward by giving schools more authority to get\u2014and keep\u2014firearms out of the classroom. For these reasons, I oppose the Harkin amendment. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise to support Senator H ARKIN in his amendment to reduce juvenile crime by helping schools to maintain safe en-vironments while ensuring that trou-bled students get the help they need. Students who bring guns or other dangerous weapons to school should be removed. But they should also be pro-vided with the appropriate interven-tions and services. This amendment clearly supports the removal of a child from school who car-ries or possesses a weapon, including a child with a disability. This amendment clearly supports an agency reporting a crime committed by a child, including a child with a dis-ability, to the appropriate authorities. This amendment clearly supports law enforcement and judicial authorities in exercising their responsibilities with regard to crimes committed by a child, including a child with a disability. But this amendment, unlike the Frist-Ashcroft amendment, will ensure that immediate, appropriate interven-tions, including mental health services, are provided to a troubled child. We know that when educational serv- ices for students are stopped, those stu-dents show increased drop out rates, increased drug abuse, and increased rates of juvenile crime and incarcer-ation. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov \u2014 SENATE S5693 May 20, 1999 I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of the Harkin-Kennedy amend-ment. It will help to ensure that our schools remain conducive to learning and our communities remain safe. Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I'm pleased to join my colleagues Sen-ator H ARKIN and Senator W ELLSTONE in offering an amendment that will help reduce crime and violence in our na-tion's schools. This amendment specifically address- es the issue of our children's emotional well-being, and what we as a nation, can do to provide schools with the nec-essary resources to help our kids. The lives of America's children are very different than they were 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Before our children reach their teenage years, they've already been exposed to drugs, alcohol, violent movies and a general culture of vio-lence that influences their thoughts and actions. Many have expressed that they are even desensitized to violence in their everyday lives. And today's students bring more to school than just backpacks and lunch boxes. They bring severe emotional problems. They disrupt classes, they have dif- ficulty learning, they suffer from de-pression, and they fight with teachers and students. And when they do not know how to deal with their feelings of anger and rage, they may even kill. Since the school shooting a year ago in Jonesboro, I have been grappling with ideas to ensure that this type of tragedy never happened again. Unfor-tunately, it did happen again and we as a nation have got to act. Children should not be afraid to go to school in the morning and parents should not be scared to send them there. Studies show that 71% of chil-dren ages 7 to 10 say they are worried they will be stabbed or shot while at school. The Department of Education re- ported that in 1997, there were approxi-mately 11,000 incidents nationally of physical attacks or fights in which weapons were used. I don't claim to have all the answers on how to help our children, but I do think we should do more to get to the root of the problem. We've got to look at the source of this problem; we must come up with some kind of preventive medicine, rather than using a haphazard Band- aid approach. Metal detectors and controlling ac- cess to guns can hinder their ability to act out, but doesn't address their ill-ness to begin with. And as the tragedies in Jonesboro, Paducah and most recently as the hor-ror in Colorado has shown us\u2014while much of our country is prospering eco-nomically, we cannot allow our coun-try's economic success cause us to ig-nore our social ills. We can train our children to use com- puters, to analyze stocks and to meet the economic challenges of the new millennium. But if we do not address their emotional needs or teach them the value of human life, then what have we accomplished? As Theodore Roosevelt said, ''To edu- cate a man in mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to society.'' Together, we must call for improve- ments, changes and accountability. This can be done, and it must be done. We can install more metal detectors and surveillance cameras in schools, but we won't get to the root of the problem. The youth of America are suf-fering and all the increased security in the world may ease our minds, but it won't solve their problems. The United States Congress can lead the way. We can take common-sense steps to see that tragedies like those in Colorado and Jonesboro become a dis-tant, painful memory. I've traveled all over my home state of Arkansas talking with educators and school administrators about what's happening in our schools. The one common denominator\u2014the one thing they all tell me is\u2014''We need more counselors in our schools. We need more qualified mental health pro-fessionals to adequately deal with the enormous and overwhelming problems kids have today.'' The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that although 7.5 mil-lion children under the age of 18 re-quire mental health services, fewer than 1 in 5 receive it. The Harkin/Lincoln/Wellstone amendment calls for $15 million in au-thorizing funds for FY 2000. In order for these services to reach children at a younger age, this money must be spent in elementary schools. Only qualified mental health profes- sionals may be hired with this funding. Fortunately, these funds are eligible to urban, suburban and rural local school districts. As we all know, rural and suburban areas need our help as much as inner city schools. The additional school counselors, psychologists and social workers will work hand-in-hand with an advisory board of parents, teachers, administra-tors and community leaders to design and implement counseling services. School counselors will involve the parents of children who receive serv-ices so parents can be more involved in the development and well-being of their children. This legislation will help accomplish that and will allow teachers to focus more on a student's skills at writing and arithmetic, rather than on his or her potential for violence. I will fight to see that this legisla- tion passes, so we can begin to make changes happen in my home state and across our country now, and not wait until the next tragedy. I hope my col-leagues will work with me in that ef-fort. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent that an article by Doug Peters of the Arkansas Democrat Gazette re-garding teen death be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: [From the Arkansas Democrat Gazette, May 18, 1999] STATE 'STEENDEATH RATENEARTOP IN U.S., STUDY SAYS (By Doug Peters) Being a teen-ager is risky, no matter where you are. In Arkansas, it can be downright dan- gerous. Only two states and the District of Colum- bia had higher rates of teen-age deaths by accident, homicide or suicide in 1996, accord-ing to a study of childhood risk factors re-leased today by the Annie E. Casey Founda-tion. According to the Kids Count 1999 study, 181 Arkansas teen-agers between 15 and 19 died of such causes in 1996, for a rate of 94 deaths per 100,000. Arkansas' rate is more than 50 percent higher than the national rate of 62 deaths per 100,000 teen-agers. And while the national rate decreased slightly between 1985 and 1996, Arkansas' rate increased by 16 percent. Only Mississippi, Wyoming and the Dis- trict of Columbia had higher teen-age death rates in 1996, the most recent year statistics were available for all states and the District of Columbia. Dr. Bob West, a pediatric medical consult- ant for the state Department of Health, said Arkansas' increase appeared to be caused by increasing numbers of teen suicides and homicides. Between 1985 and 1989, Arkansas averaged 18 suicides and 15 homicides a year among 15 through 19-year-olds, according to Health Department statistics. In 1996, 32 Arkansans in that age group committed suicide. An-other 32 were murdered. Arkansas traditionally has a high rate of accidental deaths among teen-agers, West said. And although the number of traffic deaths among 15 through 19-year-olds dropped from an average of 95 a year between 1985 and 1989 to 85 in 1996, the state's rate re-mains significantly higher than the national average. Traditionally, Arkansas accidental death rates run about 40 percent above the na-tional average, West said. West said that accidents in rural areas sometimes turn fatal because of a lack of nearby trauma services. But location isn't the only factor, he said. Attitude also may play a role. Some people, he said, simply don't see ac- cidents as being preventable. ''I think there are a lot of folks who think, 'If it happens, it happens,''' West said. ''There doesn't seem to be the willingness to do the kind of things that will keep you safe'' such as wearing seat belts or installing smoke detectors. The dismal teen-age death rate helped Ar- kansas slip to 43rd overall in the Kids Count rating, an annual state-by-state ranking of risk factors to children's well-being. Arkan-sas ranked 41st last year. The survey wasn't all bad news, though. Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, four weeks ago, an unspeakable act of vio-lence occurred at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado when 12 innocent students, a heroic teacher and the two student gunmen were killed. This incident was the 8th deadly school shooting in 39 months. The tragedy at Columbine High School is still very fresh in our minds VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5694 May 20, 1999 and our hearts. Our thoughts and pray- ers remain with the people of Little-ton, Colorado. The students of Columbine have re- turned to classes in a neighboring school. They have taken an important first step in the healing process. Unfor-tunately, the scars of this tragedy will remain with them, their families, the Littleton community and the nation for a long time to come. In the aftermath of this most recent school shooting, we must examine the causes of the outbreak of violence and work on initiatives that will prevent such occurrences in the future. During the course of the debate on the pending legislation, Juvenile Jus-tice Bill we have already discussed many of the issues related to violence. We must examine the impact that mov-ies, music, television and video games have on outbreaks of violence. We must also curtail the easy access to guns that enable individuals to commit such acts of violence. We must also talk about how we can prevent such heinous acts from hap-pening again. I would like to take a few moments to discuss one innovative pro-gram that can help us prevent violent acts from happening in the first place. Two weeks ago, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Com-mittee, of which I am a member, held a hearing on the important topic of school safety. We heard testimony from many experts about the extent of the problem and began an important search for solutions so that it will never, ever happen again. One of the witnesses was Jan Kuhl, the Director of Guidance and Coun-seling for the Des Moines School Dis-trict. Jan talked about an innovative elementary school counseling program called Smoother Sailing and the im-pact the program has had on students in the Des Moines schools. Smoother Sailing operates on a sim- ple premise\u2014get to kids early to pre-vent problems rather than waiting for a crisis. As a result, the district more than tripled the number of elementary school counselors to make sure that at least one well-trained professional is available in every single elementary school building. Smoother Sailing began in 1988 as a pilot program in 10 elementary schools. The program increased the number of counselors in the elementary schools so there is one counselor for every 250 students\u2014the ratio recommended for an effective program. The participating schools began seeing many positive changes. After two years, the schools partici- pating in Smoother Sailing saw a dra-matic reduction in the number of stu-dents referred to the office for discipli-nary reasons. During the 1987-88 school year, 157 students were referred to the office for disciplinary action. After two years of Smoother Sailing, the number of office referrals in those schools dropped to 83\u2014a 47% reduction in office referrals. During the same period, Des Moines elementary schools with a traditional crisis intervention counseling program had only a 21% reduction in office re-ferrals. There were other changes as well. Teachers in Smoother Sailing schools reported fewer classroom disturbances and principals noticed fewer fights in the cafeteria and on the playground. The schools and classrooms had be-come more disciplined learning envi-ronments. It was clear that Smoother Sailing was making a difference so the counseling program was then expanded to all 42 elementary schools in Des Moines in 1990. Smoother Sailing continues to be a success. Smoother Sailing helps students solve problems in a positive manner. Assessments of 4th and 5th grade stu-dents show that students can generate more than one solution to a problem. Further, the types of solutions were positive and proactive. We know that the ability to effectively solve prob-lems is essential for helping students make the right decisions when con-fronted with violence or drugs. Smoother Sailing gets high marks in surveys of administrators, teachers and parents. They report a high degree of satisfaction with the program. 95% of parents surveyed said the counselor is a valuable part of my child's educational development. 93% said they would seek assistance from the counselor if the child was experi-encing difficulties at school. Administrators credit Smoother Sail- ing with decreasing the number of stu-dents suspensions and referrals to the office for disciplinary action. In addi-tion, principals report that the pro-gram is responsible for creating an at-mosphere that is conducive to learning. Experts tell us that to be effective, there should be at least one counselor for every 250 students. Unfortunately, the current student-counselor ratio is more than double the recommended level\u2014it is 531:1. That means coun-selors are stretched to the limit and cannot devote the kind of attention to children that is needed. In most schools, the majority of counselors are employed at the middle and secondary levels. Therefore, the situation is more acute in elementary schools where the student to counselor ratio is greater than 1000:1. I ask unani-mous consent that a copy of this table be inserted in the R ECORD at this point. Smoother Sailing was the model for the Elementary School Counseling Demonstration Act, a section of the El-ementary and Secondary School Act. It reauthorizes the program and au- thorizes $15 million to establish more effective elementary school programs. The amendment I am offering with Senators L INCOLN and W ELLSTONE is supported by several organizations\u2014 the American Counseling Association, the American School Counseling Asso-ciation, the American Psychological Association the National Association of School Psychologists, the School of Social Work Association of America and the National Association of Social Workers. Mr. President, CNN and USA Today recently conducted a public opinion poll of Americans. They asked what would make a difference in preventing a future outbreak of violence similar to those that have occurred over the past 39 months. The leading response was to restrict access to firearms. The second most popular response\u2014a response selected by 60% of those polled\u2014was to increase the number of counselors in our na-tion's schools. We should heed the advice of the American people. We have a desperate need to improve counseling services in our nation's schools. Our amendment is an important first step in addressing this critical issue and I urge my col-leagues to support the amendment. I ask unanimous consent a table of U.S. counselor-to-students ratios be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: U.S. COUNSELOR-TO-STUDENT 1Calculated ratio is based on 1996 data, counting guidance counselors as full-time equivalents.

Mr. President, we have heard a lot about gun shows, pawn shops, and ammo clips these past few days. We have been told that if we just tweak the law a little here, or add an-other provision making something else illegal that somehow people who gun down others in cold blood won't do it anymore. It's as if wishing would make it so. Thirty years ago we had very few gun laws, and surprisingly, no high school shooting sprees to document every few days, every few weeks, or every few months. But thirty years ago we also had stricter discipline in schools, no school officials worried about lawsuits if they expelled a violent child, and parents who also exerted more control. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5696 May 20, 1999 Now we have a new gun law a year. We have school officials who fear law-suits, and federal law which seems de-signed to keep violent kids in class-rooms, rather than removed\u2014although I hope the Frist-Ashcroft amendment will make some improvements. And we have an industry\u2014in the name of en-tertainment\u2014that produces violence and violent pornography at such a pace that no one has any idea of the breadth and width of exposure our kids now have to it. Movies, television, videos, music, computer games. Killing, maiming, and destruction\u2014all in the name of enter-tainment. Why is anyone surprised in this new topsey-turvy world, that some students plan mass murders rather than plan-ning their graduation party. Today I thought it time to inject a little dose of reality into these pro-ceedings, and get us started down a road which I believe needs to be ex-plored. My amendment empanels an independent commission to study the motion picture industry\u2014from top to bottom\u2014to see if the federal govern-ment is subsidizing, facilitating or oth-erwise encouraging the production of violent, or pornographic materials. And if so, to make recommendations to Congress and the President to promote accountability in the motion picture industry in order to reduce juvenile ac-cess to violent, pornographic, or other harmful material in motion pictures. Simply put, we want to discourage, not encourage access to these materials. At the outset, let's make it clear that a great deal of what kids see on the big screen is not harmful and it is done by talented people who are just as concerned about our young people as anyone else. However, there are hun-dreds, if not thousands of releases each year that have profound effects on teens who see them. Let us be very clear about one other thing before we continue, because we have head a lot about the gun industry and their so-called political power. Mr. President, they don't hold a can- dle to the movie industry. Hollywood has the money, the glamour, the life-style of the rich and famous. They have Beverly Hills, they generate publicity for a living, and they have access to the Lincoln Bedroom. In fact, the NRA actually brought in a famous actor in order to have some hope of getting a fair hearing for its position. But the most disturbing, and least discussed these past few days, is ex-actly who it is in this country that has glamourized guns and violence. It is certainly not everyone's favorite bo-geyman the NRA. It is not the biathletes who compete in the Olym-pics. Quite simply, it is the entertain-ment industry. Guns, gore, and vio-lence, targeted not at soccer moms\u2014 but to their sons. And worse yet, it is not just gun use, but gun misuse which is glorified. Gun- toting murders as heros, out to right some perceived wrong. Who even knew what an Uzi or Tech 9 was until they saw it in some show? I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the R ECORD a May 11, 1999, article by Michael Atkinson entitled ''The Movies Made Me Do It.'' There being no objection, the mate- rial was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: [The Village Voice, May 11, 1999] THEMOVIES MADEMEDOIT (By Michael Atkinson) On March 5, 1995, Sara Edmondson, the 18- year-old scion of one of Oklahoma's most prominent political clans, holed up with her 17-year-old boyfriend Ben Darras in her fam-ily's cabin with a video Copy of Natural Born Killers, a Smith & Wesson .38, and a reported 17 tabs of acid. It's clear neither how many times they watched the film nor what the timetable had been for dropping all that dope, but, over the next two days, the teen-agers road-tripped south, first shooting Hernando, Louisiana, cotton-gin manager Bill Savage, and then, the following day, convenience-store clerk Patsy Byers. Ini-tially they had intended to go to a Grateful Dead concert in Memphis, but got the date wrong. Edmondson got 35 years; Darras got life. Savage was DOA, and his hometown friend John Grisham raised a public stink over the Oliver Stone film, threatening to sue for product liability but never filing. Luckless, Byers was left a quadriplegic and later died of cancer, but her family's lawyer has filed a civil suit against Edmondson, Darras, Edmondson's parents, Stone, and Time War-ner, maintaining that the film's creators ''knew .... o r should have known'' that vio- lence would result from its being shown. In March, after bouncing around Louisiana courts, the case went to the Supreme Court and was seen as good to go. Here comes the flood. This April, the fami- lies of three Kentucky girls left dead after the prayer-group shooting spree of 14-year- old Michael Carneal in 1997 have filed a $130 million lawsuit against no fewer than 25 par-ties, including five film companies involved with the film The Basketball Diaries; a sin-gle scene allegedly incited Carneal to action. The dream sequence, of Leonardo DiCaprio gunning down his classmates, should be im-mediately familiar to even those who haven't bothered seeing the film, thanks to the news coverage of the Littleton rampage. Littleton itself is destined to become the na-tion's mother lode of hydra-headed copycat\u2014 crime civil suits directed at the manufactur-ers of pop culture, just as the Klebold-Harris scenario immediately became something to mimic in high schools from coast to coast. Copycat crimes have attained front-burner notoriety, and some day soon Hollywood's liberty will be pitted against the perceived welfare of America children. It's an old but neglected dynamic, and wherever you stand on the issue, itemizing the carnage attributed to the influence of movies is chilling business. After The Birth of a Nation hit big in 1915, the KKK enjoyed a huge resurgence and lynching stats shot up. James Cagney's psycho gangster in White Heat (1949) was blamed for inspiring Brit Chris Craig's 1952 shooting of a police-man. A clockwork Orange's 1971 release was followed by several rapes in England accom-panied by the rapists' renditions of ''Singin' in the Rain,'' after which Stanley Kubrick permanently removed the film from British circulation. Magnum Force's murder-by- Drano was reenacted in Utah, The Deer Hun-ter precipitated a rash of fatal Russian rou-lette duels, a fierce love of First Blood sent a deranged Englishman named Michael Ryan tearing through his village commando-style, killing randomly. Taxi Driver spoke to John Hinckley; RoboCop gave ideas to two sepa-rate killers, each of whom admitted that their evisceration methods were adopted from the film. Just days after its premiere, Money Train, itself based in part on real in-cidents, inspired token-booth thieves to in-cinerate the clerk inside. High school footballers were maimed and killed lying down on busy highways after viewing The Program. Child's Play and it first two straight-to-tape sequels hold the record for the sheer number of dead: besides two-year- old Jamie Bulger, stoned to death by a pair of 10-year-old Chucky fans in Liverpool, and 16-year-old Suzanne Capper, burned alive in Manchester by Chucky fans who played lines of the movies' dialogue to here as she was being tortured, there is the dizzying slaugh-ter of 35 Tasmainian vacationers by Martin Bryant, a mental patient ''obsessed'' with Chucky. But for sheer inspirational force, and the highest number of captured impulse killers who have directly credited the film Natural Born Killers might be the one plus ultra of copycat-killing source material. Besides the Edmondson-Darras road trip, there have been killings in Utah, Georgia, Massachu-setts, and Texas (where a 14-year-old boy de-capitated a 13-year-old girl), all involving children who afterward quoted the film to firends and authorities. In Paris, a pair of young lovers, Florence Rey and Audry Maupin, led the police on a chase that killed five; supposedly, Rey said, ''It's fate,'' a la Woody Harrelson's character Mickey, when caught. Another pair of Parisians, Veronique Herbert and her boyfriend Sebastien Paindavoine, lured a 16-year-old to his stab-bing death with promises of sex; a scene right out of Stone's film. Herbert has even named the Stone film in ther defense There are scores of other examples\u2014even Beavis and Butt-head has its ghosts, inno-cent bystanders killed by child-lit fires or child-tossed bowling balls. Hunt-and-kill computer games, which provide ersatz com-bat training, have also been cited in the Carneal suit. Of course, in each case, the pre-cise psychological role media played is never clear\u2014nor can it be, until we can map a brain like a computer hard drive. In fact, some of what the press has reported about the similarities between particular murders and particular films is flat-out wrong\u2014 scores of scenes that never occurred in Child's Play 2 were said to have been reen-acted in the Bulger murder. Still, when a Georgia teen yells out ''I'm a natural born killer!'' to news cameras after being arrested for killing an elderly man, the tie-in is hard to ignore. Legally, it may be impossible to prove in- tent on behalf of a filmmaker or a beyond-a- reasonable-doubt cause-and-effect affiliation between specific movies and specific vio-lence. How do you account for the millions of unaffected consumers? What's equally at issue is the common cultural presupposition that the entertainment media bear no culpa-bility for those who wreak havoc in imita-tion of it. Movies are movies, homicidal nuts are homicidal nuts, the crimes would occur with or without a movie's sensationalized prodding. So the wisdom goes. But is our re-lationship with movies so simple, or is there in fact something deeper, darker, going on? Could it be that visual media aren't merely a harmless, ephemeral diversion from re-ality, but a powerful factor in that reality bearing consequences we haven't foreseen? Since most of the incidents we're aware of have children at their centers, this may prove to be true. According to University of Michigan professor L. Rowell Huesmann, an expert researcher on the relationship be-tween violent media and violent behavior, ''It's been well established that media vio-lence makes kids behave more aggressively. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5697 May 20, 1999 Of course, there's no scientific way to evalu- ate how media violence may have or many have not caused real violence, but there's definitely a relationship, a ''priming'' or ''curing'' of behavior for certain individuals. The reasons are well understood in psy-chology: even as toddlers, if we see other kids push and hit to get what they want, we imitate it, we begin to learn scripts for that behavior. In addition, there have been stud-ies: you show images of gore to young chil-dren, they have a universally negative reac-tion: their heartbeat goes up, their palms sweat, and so on. You show it to them again and again, and those indications go away. They adapt, they become desensitized.'' Dr. Carole Lieberman, a Beverly Hills- based ''media psychiatrist,'' blames parental patterns of consumerism. ''There's no ques-tion that parents see it happen. The Ninja Turtles were a significant sign: everyone could see how specific violent behaviors were derived directly from that show. But they still buy the kids the computer, the violent CD games. It's cognitive dissonance\u2014they know, but they don't want their kids to be left out, to be unarmed.'' It seems the entertainment complex knows, too: Last week, MGM announced they'd like to recall every copy of The Bas-ketball Diaries from store shelves but can't thanks to a prohibitive rights agreement that lasts until June 30. Even within the Hol-lywood chambers, the cattle can get spooked: Money Train scriptwriter Doug Richardson was voted down for membership in the Academy thanks to the subway-booth torching. ''Nobody would say it was because of that incident,'' Richardson says, ''but no one would deny it. So, as a writer, am I sup-posed to wonder if what I'm doing is drama or pornography? Science is going to have to get in up to its elbows in this, I think. It's a very complicated issue, and doesn't deserve sound-bite answers. Especially since there's so much suffering. And the suffering, not of Hollywood filmmakers told they shouldn't make ultraviolent movies but of families with murdered children, may be what the debate should be about. ''We could make a great step forward by simply restricting the amount of violence to which children are ex-posed,'' Huesmann says. ''That's no great constitutional dilemma. I wouldn't be sur-prised if at this point Oliver Stone came forth and said, 'Yes, the film obviously af-fects some people in a certain way,' and if he did, that would be a significant first step.'' (Oliver Stone declined to comment.) ''Every study indicates a relationship,'' Huesmann concludes. ''Here's a not greatly known fact: that the statistical correlation between childhood exposure to violence in media and aggressive behavior is about the same as that between smoking and lung can-cer.'' Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it outlines ''copycat'' acts of violence who fashion their criminal actions\u2014murder and rape\u2014off brilliant ''how to'' works of theater such as ''Natural Born Killers'' and ''Basketball Diaries.'' We know that merchants of violence profit handsomely from some products which hurt our children and cost our society. Who for a second believes that the 40,000 murders that our children witness on the TV screen during their childhoods does not have some terrible numbing effect. We can't stop Holly-wood from producing the insanity, but we can attempt to discourage it and to help them share in the burden that their ''profiteering at any cost'' im-poses on society. Now I don't believe we need any more studies outlining the numbing effects that movie and television violence have on our children. What we need to know is\u2014are the American taxpayers subsidizing this numbing down of American youth? And if so, what can and should we do about it? That is why our Commission looks to people who are independent of the power and influence of the motion pic-ture industry. Clearly, advertising is directed at at- tracting all audiences including our young. These wealthy and talented in-dustry people have a right to produce this material but we should not extend them every courtesy when it comes to polluting the minds of our young. There is always parental responsi-bility, but that does not excuse others from acting responsibly as well. Does it, or does it not, take a village to raise a child? Last I looked, Holly-wood is part of our village. So where is the responsibility of those who produce the harmful material? Though the power of the motion pic- ture industry is great, we should take a turn listening to parents instead of ac-tors and show leadership instead of cowardice. Some may object on behalf of the wealthy merchants of carnage and smut saying they have a constitu-tional right to pollute the minds of our children and have no responsibility as an artist or producer to use their power to try and help our nation's parents. But I think they are wrong. Short- sighted and wrong. Thus if we adopt the Bond-Domenici amendment, we will be saying it is time that parents, and grandparents\u2014 not just Hollywood moguls\u2014will have an opportunity to participate in the de-bate on how best to protect our chil-dren. And if this notion offends the Hollywood crowd and their ubiquitous presence in Washington\u2014so be it. We should make quite certain that the public is not contributing or facili-tating the production of this sort of material and not facilitating its mar-keting to our young people. Of, that if we are, people understand it and decide it is good use of national resources. Now there are other thoughtful amendments to this underlying bill which call on Clinton Administration agencies to study advertising or anti- trust provisions. My amendment is de-signed to get the best minds outside of the Clinton Administration and Holly-wood\u2014and if you have any serious questions why, I think this past week-end's multi-million fund-raising trip to Beverly Hills answers those imme-diately. It is with a great sense of frustration that I come to you and that is because I am tired of telling parents that there is nothing we can do to help shield their kids beyond relying on the good will and tender mercies of the same ones making blood money off the trash. If the government can't do anything about it at this time, I think it is worth letting someone on the outside see if it is possible to bring some dis- cipline and responsibility to those who are producing and marketing the in-sanity. As you all know, not everyone in the film industry is proud of what their colleagues produce for the public. I have no intention of painting with a broad brush, but the ones without dis-cipline\u2014the ones that don't care about our children, should not be shielded from scrutiny just because they may be some of the best people to invite to parties, vacations and fund-raisers. The Commission is proposed to be made up of 12 members appointed by the President, the Majority Leader and the Speaker and review the following: (1) How the government, through the tax code or otherwise, subsidizes, fa-cilitates or otherwise reduces the cost of the production of violent, porno-graphic, or harmful materials and changes necessary to curtail such as-sistance; (2) How the movie industry markets to children and how such marketing can be regulated; (3) What standard of civil and crimi- nal liability currently exists and what standard is sufficient to allow victims to seek legal redress against motion picture productions in cases where con-tent leads to destructive behavior; (4) Whether federal regulation of con- tent is appropriate; (5) What other federal action might be taken to reduce the quantity of and juvenile access to movies containing violent, pornographic, or harmful ma-terials. The amendment requires that a ma- jority report be made within a year of enactment and requires that a min-imum number of parents be appointed to the commission. Further, it author-izes a budget for professional staff to assist on these very complex issues. This would be a powerful commission with a broad mandate that could rec-ommend that we make merchants of death liable for their work, that we make the polluter pay; or outline ways to discourage advertising to our chil-dren. We may not enact their rec-ommendations but I think it is time we hear the truth from parents\u2014parents without connections to Hollywood. It is a balanced commission and the President will get his opportunity to make appointments. He must appoint a parent of a child but he can also ap-point a first amendment absolutist and he can appoint Oliver Stone to the commission if he so desires. I know Members on both sides of the aisle share my frustration. They too have had parents tell them that each year it gets harder and harder to keep the violent images out of their kids lives. Not only movies and videos, but television, CDs, video games, radio, and even print ads. The images are starker, the violence more pronounced, the mayhem more graphic. No parent can keep it all out because it comes from everywhere. What I am saying here today is that it is time to start holding people respon-sible for their choices, and that at a VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5698 May 20, 1999 minimum, we should know if the par- ents of America are paying taxes to subsidize the filth they then try to keep out of their homes. The Bond-Domenici amendment is the right thing to do. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. S ANTORUM ). The Senator from New Mexico. Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I might not even take that long. I want to compliment the Senator from Missouri for his proposal and just speak a little bit about a word that is on a lot of people's minds these days. In fact, many people are saying: Boy, it sure would be great if we could get re-sponsibility back into our schools so our children could learn what responsi-bility means. I think it would be great if we could get the entertainment industry to show a little responsibility. Some re-sponsibility from those who make films and produce TV shows, produce advertisements, produce many of the vile computer games our young people are using so they become excellent sharpshooters, excellent killers. In fact, some of these computer games have made our children proficient at shooting people right through the head, one after another, because they learned it on the computer game. Everyone seems to be saying that our children need to learn greater responsi-bility. Actually, Hollywood and those who produce television shows and mov-ies, they are the ones in need of a new sense of responsibility. I do not know any way, under our Constitution, to stop what is happening. I do not know if I would be wise enough to figure it out. But I tell you, the adults who are in the entertainment industry have to, sooner or later, look at themselves and say: What is our responsibility to the young people of this country? Right now it seems there is none, other than to make money. If the adults in the entertainment industry continue to refuse to produce films that are good for our young people, even if it is more difficult to sell them, if they refuse to go out and get innova-tive people to write the kinds of things that are salutary and healthy and help-ful, then I believe they are irrespon-sible. I believe they need a lesson in re-sponsibility. Instead, they hide admi-rably behind the Constitution. I believe, if our forefathers who put the First Amendment in the Constitu-tion, the freedom of speech that the en-tertainment industry hides behind, could see what they produce, what they feed to our young people, what they feed to our society under the alleged protection of that Amendment, I be-lieve they would reconsider and try to figure some way to make sure we had a bit more responsibility built into this aspect of the American free enterprise system. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have to oppose this $1 million study of ''how the Federal Government and State and local governments, through their tax-ing power or otherwise'' helps support or subsidize the cost of producing ''vio-lent, pornographic or other harmful materials.'' Even though this is just a study, I have serious concerns about researching the need for more taxing power. Second, the juvenile crime bill al- ready contains a package of amend-ments regarding the study of the mo-tion picture industry. Third, the causes of teen violence are complex and dif-ficult to handle with tax policy. Fourth, the amendment provides broad subpoena powers. I appreciate that Senator B ONDmodi- fied his amendment by taking out the study of how another tax, an excise tax, might be structured for ''violent, pornographic, or other harmful motion picture materials.'' What is considered harmful in Tulsa, may not be consid-ered harmful in Niagara Falls, or Boise, or Key West. But in terms of the ''power to tax'' language still in the amendment it is not clear if the Fed-eral Government, or towns or states, would tell movie producers what con-tent they considered ''harmful'' or ''violent.'' Thus while the ''excise tax'' language was just taken out the study of the ''power to tax'' is still in the amendment. And that raises a lot of issues. If this power to tax authority were used what would that mean? It is not at all clear how that would work. I do not see why we should spend $1 million to study the ''power to tax.'' There were major fights years ago about whether to censor the line in ''Gone with the Wind''\u2014''Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.'' In many towns, that line could have been taxed under a ''power to tax'' if they had it then. Now, that line caused enormous num-bers of debates and editorials. I suspect that could have gotten a whopping tax back then. Or Clark Gable could have just said: ''Frankly, my dear, I am really annoyed.'' How would a new ''power to tax'' given to local, state or the Federal gov-ernment work? The earlier ''excise tax'' idea that was recently dropped raised lots of questions also. I do not know what editing of movies local gov-ernments might have ended up doing. Concerning the excise tax language, now dropped, I wondered would the local or the Federal government have imposed the tax before the movie was produced, after the movie was pro-duced, or during the editing of the movie? Or, would the States or the Federal Government have told the pro-ducers ahead of time how much they would tax them on each scene? If they were to do it that way, could they take some scenes out or pay the extra tax, like a gas-guzzler tax? I understand there are a lot of violent battle scenes in the new Star Wars movie. That would have had a pretty big gross to tax. Fortunately, the ''excise tax'' lan- guage was taken out by the sponsor of the amendment, but the ''power to tax'' language remains. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from California. Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the ranking member for yielding. I hope he will stay on the floor just a moment because I wanted to ask him something. In this amend-ment, on page 4, is something that completely astounds me. This commis-sion is going to look at whether the regulation of the content of motion pictures is appropriate. Federal regulation\u2014is this the Soviet Union? What are we doing? I ask my friend if this disturbs him that we would be considering the Federal Gov-ernment regulating the content of mo-tion pictures. Mr. LEAHY. I say to my friend from California, what I also worry about is how you determine what it is. I heard one Senator on the floor speak of hav-ing more wholesome movies. I am all for that. There are a lot of movies that I consider absolutely classic. I like the ''Quiet Man'' with John Wayne. It was filmed near the part of Ireland from where my father's family came. But there is violence, fighting, drunkenness a little bit here and there. What do you determine it is? Does the market carry that? There are a lot of wholesome films that make it. I see some things that might be con- sidered wholesome. One very popular with children are Teletubbies, but yet we heard one leading conservative reli-gious leader say that it should be taken off the air because he objected to one of the Teletubbies. Maybe we have Teletubbies on one side and televangelists on the other. Somebody suggested in one cartoon: Teletubby Tinky Winky; Televangelist Dopey Wopey. But that is what I read in the paper. Do we take that off or tax it? Maybe after the $1 million this amendment re-fers to we might have a better idea. I am not too sure I want even my own communities to determine what tax they will impose and the Federal Gov-ernment determine what tax they will impose and then have censor boards all over the place determining this one we will tax a little itty-bitty, and this one we will tax biggie bitty-bit. I point out, we do already have in the juvenile justice bill a package of amendments regarding the study of the motion picture industry, so that is going to be done anyway. Mrs. BOXER. I point out to my friend, who is such an advocate of the Constitution, that this is the third one. We have investigation mania going on here. This is the third investigation of the entertainment industry that is going to be voted on in this Senate; the third investigation. Fortunately, on the first one, we expanded it to include the gun industry. So there is one inves-tigation of the gun industry and how it peddles its products to kids, and then VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5699 May 20, 1999 there are three investigations of the entertainment industry. But this is the very first one where it says in this bill\u2014and I say to my friends, read it. They are going to look at whether there should be Federal regulation of the content of motion pictures. Maybe the Senator from Missouri is interested in writing movies, but I am not. This is what it is about. None of us was elected to be a movie writer. There is no bureaucrat I know who ought to sit around and write movies. We now have three investigations of the motion picture industry in this bill. Let me tell you what they are. The first one was the Brownback amend-ment. I actually supported it. Every-body did. I thought: OK, we will have a commission; it will look at youth vio-lence. That commission calls for the Federal Trade Commission and the At-torney General, with all the powers of their offices, to look at the marketing tactics of the motion picture industry, the entertainment industry, and the video games industry and see if they are, in fact, taking advantage of our children. Then we have the Lieberman Com- mission, which is part of the managers' amendment, which sits in this bill. I have it in front of me. Mr. L IEBERMAN , Mr. M CCAIN, Mr. B YRD, Mr. B ROWN - BACK , Ms. L ANDRIEU , et cetera. They are establishing a national youth vio-lence commission and it refers to the various powers of that commission. That is investigation No. 2. Now comes along, in case we did not do enough of this, investigation No. 3. Duplicative, I add, of the others, but a lot more frightening, because it in-cludes the possibility of Federal regu-lation of the content of motion pic-tures. It refers to changing the law to seek legal redress against producers. My friend from Missouri can take comfort in the fact that we are already doing what he wants to be done, with the ex-ception of looking at the content. I do not know whether this is going to be accepted or if there is a vote. More than likely it is going to be adopted. Set up a commission. How about doing something that will help? How about keeping our kids busy after school? Oh, no, I only got two people from the other side of the aisle. Keep our children busy after school so they are not sitting in front of the tele-vision? Oh, no, we couldn't do that, even though we have a million children waiting in line to get into afterschool programs. But, oh, let's have a third commis- sion and beat up on the entertainment industry and that is going to help keep our kids out of trouble. Look at the FBI statistics. That is when there is juvenile crime. This is a juvenile justice bill. We do a little something for afterschool in this bill, but it is just that, a little something. It will not take care of the backlog of all the children who are waiting, but, oh, we can feel real good and set up a third investigation of the entertain- ment industry. This is amazing to me. And this one is frightening to me, to think that the Federal Government may now begin to regulate the content of movies. I sim-ply think that the American people do not want to see their Government reg-ulating what can be said in a movie. If you do not like a movie, don't go see it, as Senator L EAHY said yesterday. Don't spend your dollars on violence. Turn the movie channel. But to set up now a third commission on the entertainment industry, this is just going over the top. And suggesting that they look at ways to regulate content, that is a frightening thought to me. I do not have much hope that this will be defeated because it seems to be something we are getting used to here: Let's have an investigation; it's easy; it's easy; have an investigation. By the way, it is going to cost $1 mil- lion. Do you know how many slots that could take care of for kids waiting in line to get in afterschool programs? Let's use it on something that works. A million dollars on this commission. I know my friend is a fiscal conserv-ative. I hope when this bill gets to con-ference, they can take these three in-vestigations and put them into one, be-cause this is simply amazing to me. I have every belief that the Senator's commission will be adopted. The Sen-ate is in the mood to launch yet an-other investigation, point another fin-ger and, ''Yes, I voted against after-school, but I voted for that commis-sion; I am going to save our kids.'' I am very surprised we are looking\u2014 as a matter of fact, I did not even know this was coming up until somebody said it. I thought: Wait a minute, that is confusing; we already have two in-vestigations. Now we have yet a third. I know what I am saying is not pop- ular around here, but I worry when we start talking about the Government regulating content. That reminds me of the old Soviet Union. That is gone. Let's not follow that model. I hope people vote against this. Again, I do not hold out much hope, but I hope people vote against this. I yield back my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield my- self 3 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator is recognized for 3 minutes. Mr. BOND. One always is impressed with the ability of Hollywood and their obfuscation. We have heard some re-sponses from the Hollywood commu-nity. They said this is a massive tax bill. That is not what the purpose was. We amended the amendment so it does not even refer directly to taxes. The Senator from Vermont men- tioned and gave a wonderful rendition of ''Gone With The Wind'' and ''Star Wars.'' We are not worried about ''Star Wars.'' We are not worried about ''Gone With The Wind.'' We are worried about parents who cannot stop all of the mayhem and violence and murder that is being marketed to their kids, to their kids' friends, to their kids' neigh-bors every time they turn around. We think it is time that somebody looked at how we hold Hollywood ac-countable. I am asking not that we in-vestigate. I believe there is enough evi-dence of these teenage killers, citing the fact that they have been inspired by movies, to know that something has to be done. My good friend from California said, we are regulating content. I believe she was one of the leaders who argued for regulating the content of tobacco ad-vertising and said we are going to eliminate tobacco advertising. That is content. That is regulation. That is regulation of speech. Incidentally, you can regulate what is going to children. We do regulate speech. We do not allow pornography to go to kids. We do not allow tobacco advertising to go to them. I will tell you something, when I see ''Basketball Diaries,'' with Leonardo DiCaprio as a teenage hero walking into a classroom in a black trenchcoat, with a gun, and murdering his fellow students, I see there is a message that Hollywood has sent to our kids. If I could regulate it, if I could stop it, I would like to stop it. I want to get a national debate going and ask and see how we can stop this filth being targeted at our kids. Does anyone think ''Basketball Diaries'' is designed to attract older movie viewers like me? I do not think so. That is tar-geted directly to kids. How do we deal with that? That is what the Domenici- Bond amendment asks. All of the ob-fuscation and all of the misleading ar-guments put up by the good folks in Hollywood are not going to take atten-tion away from the fact that they are responsible. Just in the last couple days the President of CBS said he was going to withdraw a violent drama called ''Falcone.'' I quote Leslie Moonves. While it's not fair to blame the media for the rampage, Moonves said that ''anyone who thinks the media has nothing to do with this is an idiot.'' I suggest that tells the tale. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Utah. Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Utah has 1 minute remain-ing. Mr. HATCH. All the Senator wants to do is set up a Commission to review these matters. We have plenty of work in this bill to take care of it. Now look, the first amendment is not absolute. There are a lot of limitations on the first amendment recognized by the courts: obscenity, pornography, fighting words, time restrictions, such as nudity in television programming\u2014 that may be stopped, television pro-gramming that may be aired\u2014indecent speech, exposure to children, and we could go on and on. It isn't like this is something unprecedented. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5700 May 20, 1999 I think we have to look at these mat- ters and see what we can do to change the culture in this society, because that is what is wrong. It is a lot more important than guns or anything else. We have made it possible for these kids to see all kinds of filth and vio-lence coming out of their ears. After a while, they get so that it becomes part of their lives. That is why this bill is so important. It is a lot more important than some of the assertions by some people on behalf of their amendments. But this is an amendment that I think we ought to vote for. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired. The Senator from Vermont has 2 12 minutes remaining. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this side has how many minutes? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two and a half minutes. Mr. LEAHY. We yield back the time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator yields back the remainder of their time. Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient sec- ond. The yeas and nays were ordered. Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Utah. Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that we stack this amendment along with the Biden amendment to be voted upon at a time to be determined by the two leaders. Mr. LEAHY. I agree. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. EDWARDS addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from North Carolina. CHANGE OF VOTE Mr. EDWARDS. On rollcall vote No. 137, I voted ''no.'' It was my intention to vote ''aye.'' I ask unanimous con-sent that I be permitted to change my vote. This would in no way change the outcome of the vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order. Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Utah.

Mr. HATCH. With respect to the amendment offered today by Senator H ELMS , which amends the Gun Free Schools Act of 1994, I must say that I support this effort to make our schools gun and drug free. The amendment would require an educational agency that receives fed-eral funds to expel for not less than one year a student determined to be in pos- session of felonious quantities of ille-gal drugs. We're talking about quan-tities that indicate hard-core drug use, or drug trafficking. We're talking about dangerous, and predatory, behav-ior. We've simply got to get the people who bring these things into our schools out of our schools. Now, I know that some of my col- leagues may be concerned with the consequences of turning disruptive stu-dents out onto the streets for one year. I assure everyone that I understand that concern and direct their attention to the Alternative Education Grant provision found in the underlying bill. This demonstration grant provides funding to state and local education agencies to set up alternative edu-cation in appropriate settings for dis-ruptive or delinquent students. These services are designed to improve the academic and social performance of these students and to improve the safe-ty and learning environment of regular classrooms. This three-year demonstra-tion project will provide alternative education to juveniles in trouble with or at risk of getting in trouble with the law, such as students who are expelled for carrying firearms or drugs to school. I applaud the efforts of Senator H ELMS for continuing to seek effective ways to curb the spiraling increase in drug abuse among our nation's youth. Anyone familiar with my record on combating illegal drug use knows that I am in favor of stiff penalties designed to deter criminal behavior, and never more so than when we are talking about behavior that harms our school children. I think this amendment, which contains a specific exception to the one-year expulsion rule by allowing the chief administering officer of the local educational agency to modify the expulsion requirement for students on a case-by-case basis, is a measured and principled response to the scourge of drugs in our schools. Like the original Gun Free Schools Act, this amendment is motivated not only by a desire to punish those who bring illegal objects into schools, but also to address the immediate threat to the entire student population created by the presence of those objects. As with guns, felonious quantities\u2014drug- trafficking quantities\u2014of illegal drugs present a direct and serious hazard, both to the individual possessors, and to the other students as well. For this reason, it is appropriate that sanctions be the same in both cases. Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the amendments be accepted en bloc and that any statements relating to the amendments be printed at the appropriate place in the R ECORD . The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendments (Nos. 369 and 370), en bloc, were agreed to. Mr. LEAHY. I move to reconsider the vote. Mr. HATCH. I move to lay that mo- tion on the table. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov \u2014 SENATE S5702 May 20, 1999 The motion to table was agreed to. Mr. HATCH. I understand we now move to the Biden amendment, the last amendment before final passage. Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Delaware. AMENDMENT NO . 371 (Purpose: To establish a 21st century community policing initiative) Mr. BIDEN. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate con-sideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Delaware [Mr. B IDEN] for himself, Mr. S PECTER , Mr. S CHUMER , Mrs. BOXER , and Mr. K OHL, proposes an amend- ment numbered 371. Mr. BIDEN. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (The text of the amendment is print- ed in today's R ECORD under ''Amend- ments Submitted.'') The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Delaware has 2212minutes. Mr. BIDEN. I beg your pardon? I thought I had 30 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. I am sorry. The Senator from Delaware has 30 minutes. Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I send this amendment on behalf of the primary sponsors: The Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. S PEC- TER; the Senator from New York, Mr. SCHUMER ; the Senator from California, Mrs. B OXER ; and the Senator from Wis- consin, Mr. K OHL; and others. This is a pretty straightforward amendment. My amendment extends for another 5 years the COPS Program which was created in the 1994 crime bill. As we all know, the COPS Pro-gram has put over 100,000 police officers on the\u2014well, they are not all on the street yet, but it funded 100,000 police officers, of whom about 11,000 are in training now. I have put on the desk of every Member of the Senate a list of the number of police officers, State and local police officers, that have been funded under the COPS Program in their States. I have put on the desk of every Mem- ber of the Senate the reduction in vio-lent crime, in property crimes, that has occurred in their State since the crime bill of 1994, which was passed, and I would make the argument that we do not have to reinvent the wheel here; it works. Cops on the street through the COPS Program work. The COPS Program is going to expire next year. Our amendment authorizes $1.15 billion per year through the year 2005. Let me explain what it does. There is $600 million more for police on the streets every year, which would give the States up to another 50,000 police officers over the next 5 years. This money, though, can always be used to retain current officers hired under the COPS Program; it can be used to pay overtime; it can be used to reimburse current cops for college and graduate school courses up to a percentage of the total money here. Since the original crime bill was the Biden crime bill that became the 1994 crime bill\u2014we put in this COPS amend-ment. At the time, we were told by ev-eryone, whether it was liberal news-paper editorials saying, we have tried this before and more cops don't work, or conservatives arguing that this was just a great big social welfare pro-gram\u2014it was going to hire a bunch of social workers\u2014we have demonstrated that it had never been done before and it works when it is done. I am reminded of the quote attrib- uted to G.K. Chesterton. He said, it is not that Christianity has been tried and found wanting; it has been found difficult and left untried. The truth of the matter is, up to the time of the crime bill of 1994, we had never made a full blown major commit-ment to help local law enforcement of-ficers increase their number. We have, in fact, increased the number of cops wearing uniforms\u2014of local police offi-cers, not Federal cops\u2014by 100,000 cops. The crime rate has plummeted, not solely because of that but, I would argue, in large part because of that. Now, I have been here long enough to know that one of the dangers of being here long enough and having worked hard on setting up a government pro-gram, which you thought about and conceived and worked on for years and years to get adopted, is that you be-come a captive of your own program. So the Senator from Pennsylvania and I would talk, back in the early days when he got here and I got here, about community policing and how impor-tant it was. Cops didn't want community polic- ing. Mayors did not want community policing. No one wanted it. My friend from Pennsylvania talked about career criminals and pointed out that only 6 percent of the criminals in America committed over 60 percent of the vio-lent crimes in America. To both of us, it didn't seem like rocket science. If you focused on going after that 6 per-cent and you put more cops on the street and you took them out of patrol cars and put them on a beat, that would have a positive impact. I didn't have the experience my friend from Pennsylvania had of being a prosecutor. I might add, the office he was the chief prosecutor of in Philadel-phia tries more criminal cases in 1 year than the entire Federal system tries in a year. The entire Federal system tries fewer cases than are tried in the Phila-delphia prosecutor's office, the Phila-delphia DA. I didn't have the experi-ence, but I was smart enough to listen to him. And I was smart enough to lis-ten to enough people who have been out there and had the experience. So as hard as it is to believe, it took us about 6 years to convince people that putting local cops on the beat made sense. I have spent, as has the Senator from New Mexico who was on the floor, a long time in this body. I think we both agree that if you take this job seri-ously and you sit in hearings year after year, day after day, month after month, unless you are an absolute idiot, you eventually learn something. Every single, solitary criminologist, every single expert, every single person who testified before the Judiciary Committee in the 16 years I chaired it or was a ranking member, said, we don't know a lot about crime but one thing we know: If there is a cop on this corner and no cop on the other corner and a crime is going to be committed, it is going to be committed where the cop is not. The second thing we know: If you have a cop in a neighborhood and they get to know the folks in the neighbor-hood, a simple thing happens\u2014trust gets built. They know the cop's name. If they know who the cop is, they are going to be more inclined to call the officer aside when a crime has been committed and say, Officer John, I know who did that. If it is a wave-by and a cop is going by in a car and he is not a community cop, they don't want to take the chance of putting them on the line. I realize these are very simple, basic, trite-sounding things I am saying, but this program works. It works well. There are a lot of ideas here that ended up being rejected because they do not pass the test of ''not invented here.'' I realize there are some con-cerns, on the part particularly of my Republican colleagues, that this may be\u2014and I am not talking about the Senator from Pennsylvania or anyone in particular\u2014a program that is viewed as being identified with the Demo-cratic Party, the President; therefore, why do we keep it going for another 5 years? I respectfully suggest that there have been some incredibly good ideas that have come out of the Republican cau-cus, including the block grant notion for police departments, including more flexibility to be given to local law en-forcement officers. I want my col-leagues to know\u2014and I understand the limitations my friend from Utah had in being able to reach an agreement here\u2014I was prepared to accept the community block grant portion of the Republican program in order to get a consensus in this process. We didn't get there. I hope that when this passes, if it passes, we can still, as we move on through this year, move on to that good idea as well. I didn't try to incor-porate it here because it is not my idea, it is the idea of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and others on the Republican caucus with whom I have to agree. Now, let me say this: One of the things we learned from the COPS Pro-gram and its functioning is that, as well as it works, it can be made to work better. I say to my friend from New York, Senator S CHUMER , he has VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 \u2014 SENATE S5703 May 20, 1999 been deeply involved. He carried this load in the House when we did this in 1994. He was a leader on the COPS Pro-gram. What he and I have both found out from our local law enforcement of-ficers is that they need more flexi-bility. They need to be able to use this COPS money in ways that go beyond hiring a new shield, to be able to keep cops who are on the beat and use this money. They also want to be able to pay overtime, because they get the same coverage as they would if they hired a new cop, if they are allowed to pay overtime. So we built into this ex-tension of the COPS Program more flexibility. To the best of my knowledge\u2014my staff is behind me; I don't have it in front of me\u2014I believe every major po-lice organization has endorsed this and endorsed it on this bill, because it works. The second thing\u2014and I will shortly yield to my friend from Pennsylvania, and then I want to reserve time for my friend from New York as well\u2014is that there is $350 million in here for law en-forcement to get new technologies to enhance crime fighting, such as better communications systems so cops in dif-ferent jurisdictions can communicate, and even the ability to target hot spots, and new investigative tools like DNA analysis. The cops have come to me and they have said, this is what we need; this is what we need. I am one who believes that as long as they keep doing the job as well as they have been, we should give them the tools they need. There is one last piece, and then I will yield. The cops have been doing such a good job that the prosecutors in Senator S PECTER 's old office are over- whelmed. They are overwhelmed. You put 100,000 more cops on the job, 545,000 cops who have already been on the job and who had not been in community policing but are all now community po-lice, and you have had a phenomenal impact on crime, but also a phe-nomenal impact on putting more pres-sure on the court systems in the State and local governments. So there is in this bill $200 million for community prosecutors to expand the community policing concept to engage the whole community in preventing crime. These cops, as I said, have been so successful with their jobs that the next piece of the puzzle, the new bot-tleneck, is State prosecutors. Local prosecutors, they need help. So the next major piece of this bill is $200 mil-lion for community prosecutors. Lastly, you are only allowed to use a portion of the COPS money for this, but one of the things the cops have come to us and said is, we have a lot of cops who want to increase their edu-cation; we have a lot of cops who want to go back to college, who want to be better cops. If you are a schoolteacher in most districts and you go off and teach school and you go off and get your graduate degree, the school dis-trict helps you pay for that. I think we should be allowing the cops to take a portion of the money they get and pay for the continuing education of law en-forcement officers. I still believe that the greatest safety lies in educated po-lice officers who fully understand the Constitution, who increase their edu-cational background. So that is an-other innovation in this bill. There is much more in it that I will not bore the floor with at this time. I know a lot of people are trying to get through this bill. I respectfully sug-gest\u2014and it is imprudent of me to say this\u2014I think this is, in a substantive sense, the single most important amendment we could add to this bill. I guarantee you\u2014and I am willing to bet anybody in this body dinner\u2014that if we add another 50,000 cops out there and this technology, we are going to have a significantly greater impact on reducing juvenile crime than we would without it. It works, folks. Let's not reinvent the wheel. I have a parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. How much time remains in control of the Senator from Delaware? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator has 20 minutes 33 seconds remain-ing. Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield 9 minutes to my friend from Pennsyl-vania and 9 minutes to my friend from New York. I will reserve 2 minutes for myself to close. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Pennsylvania is recognized for 9 minutes. Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Delaware for yielding me the time and for submit-ting this amendment, which I have co-sponsored. I believe that police on the street constitute a very significant de-terrent effect\u2014and that the 95,000 or 100,000 police who have been added across America have been a factor in reducing the crime rate\u2014which we have noted in the past several years. I think that is one factor. The additional prison space, the fact that more men and women are incar-cerated\u2014regrettably, but necessarily\u2014 I think has been a contributing factor. The armed career criminal bill, which provides for a sentence for 15 years to life for those found in possession of a gun and have committed three or more serious offenses has been a significant contributing factor. I would like to offer a comment or two about the bill. I compliment Sen-ator H ATCH and Senator L EAHY , the managers of the bill, for the work they have done. I am hopeful that within the authorized portions of this bill comes to the appropriations process, there will be an even 50/50 split on measures designed for prosecution and incarceration, contrasted with meas-ures for rehabilitation, job training, and education. When we deal with juvenile offenders, we deal with a category of offenders who will one day get out. I believe\u2014 based on the experience I had being dis-trict attorney of Philadelphia for 8 years where the principal job was pros- ecution, tough sentences for tough criminals, and dealing with career criminals\u2014that when we deal with of-fenders who are going to be released, we ought to have rehabilitation. It is no surprise when a functional illit-erate, without a trade or a skill, leaves incarceration will go back to a life of crime. It is not only in the interest of the individual to have rehabilitation, but also in the interest of law-abiding citizens to avoid having that individual become a repeater. The same thing, candidly, applies to first and second offenders. Where we have a career criminal\u2014somebody who has three or more major offenses\u2014then I think life imprisonment and throwing away the key is the appropriate con-sequence. When we deal with juveniles, we ought to be aware of the so-called seamless web, to apply 50 percent of the funding which, of course, comes to the attention of the appropriators. I considered submitting an amendment which would have called for a 50/50 split between the tough aspect of prosecu-tion and incarceration contrasted with rehabilitation, literacy training, and job training. I decided not to do that since it really is within the function of the appropriators. I have a comment on the vote in the Senate to defeat the provision that was offered as an amendment yesterday. This would have imposed, in this bill, a mandatory requirement on the States that all those 14 years and older be tried as adults on a category of serious offenses. That was defeated soundly. A majority of Republicans voted against it, and I voted against it, and I was glad to see that amendment rejected on a number of grounds. One is that we ought not to be dictating to the States how they construct their juvenile jus-tice system. And we ought not to con-dition Federal funding, which would be the stick to dictate the States as to how they operate. The other concern I had was that being tough on crime is very, very im-portant, but there are a lot of vari-ations on juveniles. The theory of the juvenile court was to treat an adjudica-tion of delinquency as those under 18. There is ample discretion in the juve-nile court to have a juvenile tried as an adult for a serious offense. That flexi-bility ought to be left to the juvenile courts, and that flexibility and that de-termination ought to be left to the States. Overall, I think this bill will be a step forward. The legislation that has been enacted with respect to guns, I think, has to be viewed as only a part of the picture. My own reluctance on the restrictions on guns has come from the fact that there has not been an ap- propriate response by the courts on tough sentences for tough criminals. There are three layers that we have to attack on this line. I have discussed two. One is the life sentences and the long periods of incarceration for career criminals. Second, is realistic rehabili-tation for juveniles and other offenders VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5704 May 20, 1999 who will be released from jail. Third, is the violence that has gripped Amer-ica\u2014juvenile violence especially. After Littleton, CO, I called Dr. Koop, former Surgeon General, who commented to me that he had\u2014as early as 1982\u2014filed a report identifying juvenile violence as a medical problem. I conferred with Surgeon General Satcher on the issue. We are trying to structure hearings on the Appropria-tions subcommittee I chair on health and human services which funds the Of-fice of Surgeon General. Those three lines, I think, have to be studied very closely\u2014the sentencing for career criminals and rehabilitation for those who will be released and an effort to understand and try to deal with the culture of violence we have in our soci-ety today. I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague from Delaware. I yield the floor, releasing the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from New York is recognized for 9 minutes. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank the Sen-ator from Delaware not only for his generous use of the time\u2014which I will not need all of\u2014but, more importantly, for his leadership on this issue in 1994, and again today. And I thank my friend from Pennsylvania, as well, for both of those things. I have been in this Congress a long time; this is my 19th year. I have rare-ly seen a program be as effective as the COPS Program. It has worked. It has brought police officers and, just as im-portant, new policing techniques from the largest city to the smallest rural hamlet. Before this bill passed, Amer-ica, from one end of the country to the other, was crying out: Do something about ending crime. Some said it is a local issue, not a Federal issue. But the average person didn't care about that. The average person just said to his or her govern-ment: Please, in God's name, do some-thing. Stop the robberies, stop the bur-glaries, stop the auto thefts, and stop the murders. A number of us who were concerned about this issue, including the Senator from Delaware, the Senator from Penn-sylvania, and myself when I was then in the House, just scoured the country. We tried to find out what worked\u2014not ideological, but something where we could have prevention or punishment. We found out that community policing worked just about better than any-thing else. Yes, we should have incar-cerated more criminals\u2014now we are\u2014 and had tougher penalties. Yes, we needed afterschool programs and things to help. The bill Senator B IDEN and I au- thored\u2014he in the Senate and myself in the House\u2014was called ''tough on pun-ishment, smart on prevention.'' That was our credo. Probably the most im-portant and best program in that bill was the COPS Program. As I say, I have seen it work in every part of my State. Violence is down, property theft is down, police officers are more fulfilled in the job that they do. In my own home State, in Buffalo, crime has been slashed more than 30 percent; in Al-bany, 24 percent; in Nassau County, 24 percent; in New York City, 44 percent. Talk to police chiefs, talk to ordinary cops, talk to criminologists; they will all point to the COPS Program. My colleagues, this program expires in the year 2000. If it is so successful, and if we want to continue our fight against crime, we should be doing this. Keep up tough punishment, keep up smart prevention, but continue to fund this successful program. My colleague from Delaware is not being hyperbolic when he says this is one of the most important programs that we passed. We need to continue it. And putting 30 to 50 new officers on the beat, particularly the middled-sized and small cities, which have not ap-plied because they haven't had the chance that the larger cities have had, is vital. It will help economically dis-tressed communities, which all of us represent\u2014no matter what part of the country we are in\u2014to absorb some of the long-term costs of new police hires. And when crime goes down, which it does, because of the COPS Program, there are more jobs in a community, there is better health in a community, and the educational system works bet-ter in a community. It is good in every way. COPS isn't the only reason crime has gone down. But, just the same, no one can reasonably claim it is not a good part of the reason. I urge my colleagues in the strongest of terms to support this amendment to continue this magnificently successful program. I yield the remainder of my time. Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to reserve the remainder of the time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator reserves 9 minutes 4 seconds. Mr. SCHUMER. The time the Senator from Delaware so generously yielded to me I yield right back to him. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Utah. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from Okla-homa desires. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Oklahoma. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator B IDEN, who is on the floor. Maybe he can answer a cou-ple of questions. I am trying to find out how much this amendment costs. Can you tell me how much it costs a year? Mr. BIDEN. It will cost over 5 years $1.15 billion\u2014total cost for 5 years. Mr. NICKLES. Maybe I am reading the amendment wrong. The way I am reading the amendment, it says\u2014\u2014 Mr. BIDEN. I beg the Senator's par- don. It is $1.150 billion per year. Mr. NICKLES. Just a few billion dol- lars. Mr. BIDEN. Over 5 years\u2014it is over $1 billion. Mr. NICKLES. $1.150 billion each year. Mr. BIDEN. That is correct. Mr. NICKLES. That is to hire how many cops? Mr. BIDEN. It could hire up to 50,000 cops. Mr. NICKLES. One-hundred and fifty thousand, or fifty thousand? Mr. BIDEN. It could fund 50,000 cops for the entirety of the 5 years. But it could also only hire 30,000 cops, if in Oklahoma City they decide to use the COPS money for overtime instead of hiring new shields. Mr. NICKLES. What is the estimated cost, or subsidy, or the Federal pay-ment per cop? Mr. BIDEN. It is roughly $50,000. Mr. NICKLES. The first year? Mr. BIDEN. The first year\u2014per year. Mr. NICKLES. Let me back up. I will reclaim my time, but please correct me if I am wrong. I asked staff how much this subsidy cost, and they said the old program cost a total of $75,000 over 3- year period\u2014$50,000 the first year, $15,000 the second year, and $10,000 the third year\u2014for a total over a 3-year pe-riod of $75,000 in a Federal subsidy. Mr. BIDEN. That is correct. Mr. NICKLES. The staff tells me that under the proposed new authorization that cost rises from $75,000 to $125,000 per police officer. Is that correct? Mr. BIDEN. I don't know how they get that number. Mr. NICKLES. I am just getting it from staff. My point is that this is an enormously expensive program. Let me ask the question a different way. If I can have the Senator's atten-tion, I only have 7 minutes and I have to go kind of quick. Can he tell how much the cost is per cop per subsidy per year? It is grad-uated\u2014100 percent the first year, and some other reduced percentage over the next 2 years. Can the Senator give us those percentages? Mr. BIDEN. The same as the existing COPS Program. Mr. NICKLES. Let me reclaim my time. On page 10 of the amendment, it says ''hiring cops.'' It says the bill is amended by striking $75,000 and insert-ing $125,000. The cost of this program\u2014the sub- sidy of this program right now of the current program, the one we have had for the last 5 years\u2014has been a Federal subsidy per cop of $75,000. That is a pretty generous subsidy. I believe the first year subsidy is $50,000. In Okla-homa that may pay the entire salary of a cop. Maybe it doesn't in some places. But it does in my State. Then the sub-sidy is reduced the next couple of years so that by the fourth year, the total cost of the program needs to be borne by the city. This subsidy is much greater. The Senator's amendment says the subsidy increases from $75,000 to $125,000. For VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 SENATE S5705 May 20, 1999 $125,000, you can pay, frankly, probably the entire 3-year salary in many areas\u2014certainly in rural areas. And some people said we purported to help them particularly. I just question the wisdom of doing it. I have just two more comments. We are having the Federal Government provide for police in cities, and that is not a Federal responsibility. I think it is a mistake. I also think it is kind of gratuitous to say this program is responsible for the decline in crime rates. I think that might be a lot more attributable to a change in political leadership in the states and in the Congress. I know the mayor in New York City has had a dif-ferent philosophy on crime which is greatly responsible for the reduction in crime. Now he may take advantage of this program. In a lot of cities they are going to say: Hey, if you will help pay for our police force, thank you very much. But why should we be doing it? Is that a Federal responsibility? The whole purpose of the program initially, if I understand it, was that we were going to put 100,000 cops on the street, but then phase it out. This was not going to be an addiction for cities. We would phase it out where the Fed-eral Government may pay 100 percent the first year, but by the fourth year the subsidy is reduced to zero. Put an-other way, where the Federal Govern-ment was paying most of the subsidy to get this thing started to hire new cops, but by the fourth year the cost would be totally borne by the city. Now we are saying let's extend it. Let's just keep this thing going. Let's have more Federal cops. Then we passed an amendment yes- terday, for the information of my col-leagues, over my objection. But it passed by unanimous consent, unfortu-nately. It said that we have a COPS Program, and some of these cops are going into schools, and we will waive the requirement of local matching funds. In other words, the cops will be paid for 100 percent by the Federal Government. That is now part of this bill. We will waive the local contribu-tion. So it won't be just a partial Fed-eral subsidy, it will be a total Federal subsidy. Is that the Federal Government's re- sponsibility? I don't think so. If we want to subsidize cities, sub- sidize cities. We are saying: Well, let's have the Federal Government do it. We have a problem. Let's just write a check. We don't think the city should be able to decide their own needs. Maybe they need computers and cars, and not cops. Maybe they need a dif-ferent training program. But we are saying, no: you are going to have the cops. There is a study that was done by the inspector general, the IG. Maybe the Senator from Utah will allude to it. The IG's research said\u2014in just one ex-ample\u201452 out of 67 grantees are receiv-ing more grants; 78 percent either could not demonstrate that they rede-ployed officers, or could not dem-onstrate they had a system in place to track the redeployment of officers into community policing. At that point, the COPS office counted 35,852 officers under more programs toward the Presi-dent's goal of adding 100,000: we hadn't made it to 100,000. It says 60 of 147 grantees\u201441 percent\u2014showed indica-tors of using Federal funds to supple-ment local funding instead of using grant funds to supplement local fund-ing. In other words, hey, Federal Govern- ment, thank you very much. You are helping meet our budgets, and we ap-preciate the contribution. Meanwhile, it just so happens that we have a Fed-eral Government that doesn't have a surplus, if you do not include the So-cial Security surplus. I don't think we should be sub- sidizing cities. I don't think we should get cities addicted to this program that will never end, especially when you are talking about increasing the cost from $75,000 per police officer to $125,000. I don't think we can afford that. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Utah. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rec- ommend to the Senator from Delaware that what we should have done is con-sider this amendment\u2014that is, the Senator's legislative proposal\u2014on the Department of Justice reauthorization bill, and deal with this issue at that time, but only after hearings to see whether we can resolve some of these problems raised by the Inspector Gen-eral. The Biden amendment reauthor-izes the Clinton administration's COPS Program. This amendment would cost in the neighborhood of $7 billion. It doubles the cost of this bill. I don't op-pose more money to hire police and have law enforcement, but we need to ensure flexibility in our grant pro-grams. The Biden amendment does not provide for adequate flexibility. The Congress has provided flexible grants to law enforcement through the local law enforcement block grants. Ironically, the President's budget zeros out funding for the block grant program. Here we are debating a $7 bil-lion amendment. The Department of Justice is proud of this program, but the Department of Justice's Inspector General does not share their view. The Department of Justice's Inspector Gen-eral found serious mismanagement and inappropriate use of funds. Let me cite a few examples that the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma referred to: 20 out of 145 grantees, 14 percent, overestimated salaries and or benefits in their grant application. I won't read all of this, but let me cite just a few more. 74 of 146 grantees, 51 percent, in- cluded unallowable costs in claims for reimbursement; 52 out of 67 grantees receiving COPS MORE grants, 78 per- cent, either could not demonstrate that they redeployed officers or could not demonstrate they had a system in place to track redeployment of officers in community policing; 60 of 147 grant-ees, 41 percent, showed indications of using Federal funds to supplant local funding, instead of using grant funds to supplement local funding; 83 of 144 grantees, 58 percent, either did not de-velop a good-faith plan to retain officer positions or said they would not retain the officer at the conclusion of the grant. I believe there are some positive as- pects to the COPS Program, but a $7 billion program with serious questions concerning the management of the pro-gram and the use of grants by recipi-ents should not pass the Senate with only a 45-minute debate. I want to work with my colleagues on the law enforcement grant pro-grams, but we should not try to do it on this bill. I will work with anyone who wishes to join me, but not on this bill. I plan to move a Department of Justice reauthorization bill later this year. If my colleagues truly wish to work with me, I suggest to them we do this on that authorization bill. I reserve the remainder of my time. Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I reserve my remaining time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Delaware has 9 minutes and the Senator from Utah has 5 minutes 14 seconds. Mr. HATCH. I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Alabama. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Sen- ator H ATCH chairs the Judiciary Com- mittee. It would be the responsibility of that committee to give oversight to the COPS Program. It has been a 5- year program and requires a reauthor-ization. We just received, within the last month or 6 weeks, an inspector gen-eral's report from the Department of Justice. This is President Clinton's De-partment of Justice. It raised serious concerns about how this program is being managed and administered. When 78 percent of the recipients could not demonstrate they redeployed officers, or could not demonstrate they had a system in place to track the re-deployment of officers in the commu-nity policing, then we have a problem, since the whole COPS Program was sold as a program to further commu-nity policing. It was supposed to bring new police officers on line. We found 41 percent of the programs inspected by President Clinton's De-partment showed indicators of using Federal funds to supplant local funds instead of using grant funds to supple-ment local funding. I am reading directly from the re- port. These are very serious allegations. To pass this amendment, $7 billion to reauthorize this program, in the dead of night without any hearing would be a colossal blunder. It would be an abdi-cation of our responsibility, especially VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5706 May 20, 1999 in light of this scathing report by the inspector general's office. The thought of it boggles my mind. I can't believe it would be even suggested. We ought to review, as we were sup- posed to when the program passed 5 years ago, how it has worked. We haven't had any hearings on it. I yield the floor. Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment of-fered by my distinguished colleague from Delaware, Senator B IDEN. I would like to take this moment to highlight one element of Senator B IDEN's amend- ment, the extension and expansion of the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Program. I have heard one consistent theme throughout the debate on this juvenile justice bill: a desire to stop, once and for all, the senseless schoolhouse shootings like those that occurred in Littleton, Jonesboro and Paducah. There is a growing sense among Ameri-cans that we are no longer safe in our homes, in our schools, in our commu-nities. But while we have heard sharply disparate views about issues like gun control and content of video games in the debate so far, one sure way to re-duce crime and restore peace of mind is through community oriented policing. As you are aware, the COPS Program was established in 1994 to put more po-lice officers on the streets and to en-courage police interaction with the communities in which they work. This program is a shining example of an ef-fective partnership between local and federal governments. It provides fed-eral assistance to meet local objec-tives. It does not interfere with local prerogatives; it does not impose man-dates. The program provides funding to counties, towns and cities to enable communities to put more police on the street. Individual police and sheriff's departments have discretion over how those funds are used, because they know what problems their commu-nities face and the places they need help most. COPS has had a positive, and very tangible, impact on communities throughout the country, including in my home state of Wisconsin, by put-ting more police officers on our streets and making our citizens safer. In the state of Wisconsin alone, COPS has funded over 1,100 new officers and con-tributed more than $70 million to com-munities to make it happen. The COPS Program has succeeded because it helps individual officers to be a friendly and familiar presence in their commu-nities. They are building relationships with people from house to house, block to block, school to school. This com-munity policing helps the police to do their job better, makes the neighbor-hoods and schools safer and, very im-portantly, gives residents peace of mind. Let me illustrate the strong causal relationship between community ori-ented policing and a reduction in the crime rate. I would like to share with you the story of Chief Jeff Lieberman of Fountain City, Wisconsin. Chief Lie-berman polices a small town with big city crime problems. Chief Lieberman moved to Fountain City in 1992 and was faced with an alarming juvenile crime rate. What could he do to decrease the juvenile crime rate? While jails were being built and sentences were being stiffened, Chief Lieberman reached out to the community. He embarked upon a crusade to visit classrooms and teach children about law enforcement and safety. To allow the children to relate to him as they would to any other per-son and feel comfortable talking to him, he would sometimes dress in shorts and bring his dog to class. Not only has he won their respect, the chil-dren now show greater respect for their community. This success is reflected by the fact that during his tenure, he has reduced the juvenile crime rate by an astonishing 99%. Chief Lieberman has earned a reputa- tion in the community as a caring and compassionate citizen, as well as an outstanding law enforcement officer. I might add that Chief Lieberman was recently recognized for his effective community oriented policing by the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund as the March 1999 Offi-cer of the Month. I do not believe the answer to the tragedies in Littleton, Jonesboro and Paducah is one extreme or the other\u2014 a ban on all guns or censorship of the entertainment industry. The answer is to educate our young people, nurture them, protect them and give them thousands more ''Chief Liebermans'' across this country. Senator B IDEN's bill does just that. It provides for ex-panding the much-lauded COPS Pro-gram to ensure that we have 30,000 to 50,000 ''Chief Liebermans'' in schools, towns and cities across, not only Wis-consin, but the entire nation. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment and continuing our drive to put more police officers on the streets and in touch with their commu-nities. I yield the floor. Mr. HATCH. Let me make just a few more comments on this amendment. It has been suggested by the amend-ment's sponsors that the COPS pro-gram is responsible for the decline in crime in our country. Now, crime rates are still far too high, and are very high by historical standards. Be that as it may, we have seen some improvement in the past several years. But has the COPS Program been responsible for even the modest improvements we have seen? The evidence certainly suggests not. First of all, the program's grants have always been too spread out to have more than a marginal impact on crime rates. Second, law enforcement authorities themselves have been skep-tical. For instance, in 1995, Chicago ex-perienced sizable reductions in murder, robbery, and assault well before the COPS Program ever got off the ground. The Chicago Police Department cited a number of local initiatives that made a difference, including tracking every gun used by juvenile offenders, and using a towing ordinance in effect for narcotics and prostitution enforce-ment. Time and time again, the factor cited by the successful police executives traced the roots not to the Federal Government, but to local institutions, citizens, and police chiefs imposing ac-countability on their local police de-partments. Perhaps the best example of all is New York City, where a new police chief successfully attacked quality-of- life crimes and enforced accountability for the officers of the New York Police Department by setting standards of performance backed by a system of in-centives and disincentives. New York City's murder rate fell so fast its de-crease alone accounted for over 25 per-cent of the total nationwide drop in homicides in 1996. In 1997, the 21.7-percent drop in mur- ders in New York City represented 14.8 percent of the total national decrease in murders. Yet, in New York City, which had 38,189 police officers in 1996, they added precisely 342 Clinton cops by 1995. Only 28 of the 342 new cops were actually new hires. I would like hearings on this matter. I would like another full authorization bill. I hope our colleagues will not vote to double the costs of this bill with this particular amendment, as well in-tended as it is. The distinguished Senator from Dela- ware knows that I have great feelings for him and for what he is trying to do, but I also believe we ought to do it in the right way. Mr. BIDEN. Benjamin Disraeli says there are three kinds of lies: lies, damn lies, and statistics. I don't know where my friends have been. Every major police agency in the United States of America strongly en-dorses this particular bill. The Na-tional Fraternal Order of Police, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the National District Attorneys Association, the National Association of Police Organizations. You all ought to go home and speak to your chiefs. Find me in your State more than a handful of police officers who will come and say this is a bad idea. Find me anybody in this country who will say adding 92,000 cops on the street has not had an impact on crime. Where have you been? What are we talking about here? This doesn't even pass the smell test. Those cops don't matter? Ask Rudy Giuliani, who picks up the phone and calls me and says, J OE, great idea, when the COPS bill passed. Mr. Riordan, a Republican mayor in Los Angeles: Great bill. I wonder if anybody goes home to their States. My Lord, I don't know where you all are. I look at these num-bers. Let's talk about that report. Remem- ber, I said there are three kinds of lies: lies, damn lies, and statistics. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5707 May 20, 1999 That report referred to by the inspec- tor general says 1.2 percent of the COPS Program could have been spent better. Name for me a multibillion-dol-lar program the Federal Government has ever conceived that has a 1.2-per-cent problem. Come on. As my daughter's friends would say, Get real. What are we talk-ing about here? I was so amazed by the assertions being made, I lost my train of thought here. The inspector general's report, ''Summary of the Findings of the IG,'' page II: In considering our COPS audit results it should be kept in mind that they may well not represent the overall universe of grant-ees because, as a matter of policy, the COPS program has referred to us for review those riskiest grantees. Do you get this? Unlike the Defense Department, the Department of Edu-cation, any other Department, the At-torney General's Office said, we think maybe some of what we put out there may not be being used properly, so you go out and investigate for us. Give me a break. When is the last time you heard someone at the Defense Department say: You know, we may have overpaid a contract; you ought to go inves-tigate. When is the last time you heard someone at the Department of Edu-cation say: You know, we think we may have given a school district too much money; go investigate. With the Attorney General of the United States of America, in the COPS Program, there is a department called COPS. They said: We want you to look at this. We could have made some mis-takes here. We are not certain that every municipality used this money for cops the way we wanted to use it. Go look at it. Now these guys are trying to hoist them on their own request? By the way, 1.2 percent? I ask my friend from Oklahoma, let's look at the Defense Department; 1.2 percent? I will lay you 8 to 5 I can find a 50-percent waste of money in half the programs you support: 1.2 percent, what an in-dictment. Come on. You do not like the COPS Program because it was not in-vented there. By the way, I find it fascinating. One of my friends said: You know, part of the problem here is this has nothing to do with COPS. It had to do with polit-ical leadership. Guess who has been in charge. A guy named Clinton. That is the first admis-sion I have heard: Clinton reduced crime, more than the COPS Program. More than the COPS Program. I find that not true, but kind of encouraging. Look, COPS makes a difference. Ask your folks back home, ask the people in the gallery, ask the people out in the street, where would they rather have their money being spent? This works. This works. By the way, this bill has a little pro- vision B ARBARA BOXER has in here. It says we will pay for all the money it costs to put a cop in a school. Go home and tell the folks you do not want to do that. Go home and tell the folks that is simply a local requirement. Inflexibility? The reason it is under $25,000 is flexibility. We want to give them more flexibility to use the mon-eys they can use, still requiring the local municipality, the State, to put up their own money to do this. Come on, name a program that has worked this well. Name a program that has had this much success. Name a program that has this little amount of waste. Name a program that has fewer Federal strings attached to it. Name a pro-gram. By the way: Oversight; oversight. We have had 5 years to have oversight. One of the reasons we have not had over-sight hearings, I suspect, is you do not want to hear the results. Call in your mayors, call in your chiefs of police, call in your citizens, call in the PTA, call in the Marines. Call in anybody you want. Say: ''By the way, I'll tell you what we are going to do. We are going to cut funding for COPS, that's what we're are going to do.'' I dare you. Come on. In New York City\u2014I do not know how many New York received. I will tell you what, New York State over this period received\u2014I bring up the subject because New York was men-tioned \u2014New York State has 10,550 cops. ''But they did not make any dif-ference, by the way. New York is safer because there is a Republican mayor. That is the reason. COPS had nothing to do with this, nothing to do with this. I want you all to know that, COPS had nothing to do with crime going down.'' Does everybody hear that? Is every- body listening? ''The additional cops have nothing to do with this.'' That is the Republican position. COPS do not have anything to do with this. If they do, the Federal Government should not be involved. Let me conclude by saying this. My friend says, why should the Federal Government be involved? Because Fed-eral policy is part of the problem. The drug problem in America is a Federal problem, not just a local problem. A significant portion of the crime is caused as a consequence of the inter-national drug problem, and it is a Fed-eral problem, Federal responsibility. I thank my friend. I hope my col- leagues will vote for this amendment. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The Senator from Utah. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I note the distinguished Senator did not dispute the findings of the inspector general. I ask unanimous consent an editorial from USA Today entitled ''100,000-cops program proves to be mostly hype'' be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: [From USA Today, Apr. 13, 1999] 100,000-C OPSPROGRAM PROVES TOBEMOSTLY HYPE Nassau County, N.Y., needed more police, or so it said. So, Uncle Sam ponied up $26 million from President Clinton's much- vaunted Community Oriented Policing Serv-ices (COPS) program to help it add 383 police to the beat. And what happened? In an audit being compiled for the Justice Department, its Of-fice of Inspector General found that the ac-tual number of county-funded police officers went from 3,053 in May 1995 to 2,835 in May 1998\u2014a decline of 218. What's going on? A lot of funny number crunching at the expense of taxpayers and possibly crime-fighting. When President Clinton initiated the $8.8 billion program in 1994, he promised it would put 100,000 more police on the street after five years. Then, communities pay their own tabs. But Nassau County is one of more than 100 communities where federal auditors found costly problems. A final report detailing them is expected this week. And initial re-search for that report paints a bleak picture. Richmond, Calif., for example, received $944,000 in COPS grants from 1995 to 1997 to add nine officers. It used the money to fund vacant positions instead. Atlanta, federal auditors found, used COPS money to replace it own police funds, too. And auditors look-ing at $400,000 in grants for Alexandria, Va., found no documentation that equipment pur-chased with the grant money put more offi-cers on the street as pledged. Many of the communities have excuses. For instance, Nassau County is in fiscal cri-sis. The discrepancies, though, indicate much of the hype for COPS is misleading. Two weeks ago, Vice President Al Gore claimed COPS had already added 92,000 po-lice, who were playing ''a significant role in reducing crime,'' Yet, as the audits indicate, the numbers don't add up. Many of the new police are fictitious. In addition, the admin-istration counted 2,000 police hired with prior federal grants toward the 100,000 goal. Finally, a third of the counted positions have come from grants funding new civilian positions and equipment, not police. Spo-kane, Wash., which wasn't audited, says it added only a couple of dozen officers, though it was credited with adding more than 90. The reason: a $2.5 million equipment grant. As for the claim that more police equals less crime, the evidence isn't clear. Nassau County, despite its drop in police, has seen its crime rate drop as much as in New York City, which has increased its force by a third since 1992. And many communities that didn't accept any COPS grants saw crime decline precipitously, too. The COPS program has done little to ex- plain these discrepancies. It instead points to support from police chiefs and national crime statistics as proof the program works. The public naturally wants safer streets, and the Clinton administration is trying to politically cash in again by pushing a new $6.4 billion plan to add up to 50,000 more po-lice on the beat. But before Congress gives it the money, it should demand that the ad-ministration better monitor its grants and results. Taxpayers shouldn't be asked to pay for police who may not even be there. Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the report of the IG be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: VerDate Mar 15 2010 SENATE S5708 May 20, 1999 1In addition to expanding on issues contained in this summary report, the program audit will report on COPS' ability to meet the President's goal to put 100,000 additional police officers on the street by 2000. The exact nature of the goal has become con-fused because of conflicting statements made by Ad-ministration officials, who state that the goal is to put 100,000 new officers on the street by the year 2000, and recent statements made to use by COPS of-ficials, who state that the goal is to fund 100,000 new officers. The program audit addresses that issue at length and also addresses COPS' and OJP's moni-toring of grantees and the quality of guidance pro-vided to grantees to assist them in implementing es-sential grant requirements. POLICE HIRING AND REDEPLOYMENT GRANTS SUMMARY OF AUDIT FINDINGS AND REC- OMMENDATIONS , O CTOBER 1996-S EPTEMBER 1998\u2014E XECUTIVE SUMMARY I. BACKGROUND In 1994, the President pledged to put 100,000 additional police officers on America's streets to promote community participation in the fight against crime. He subsequently signed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (Crime Act), author-izing the Attorney General to implement over six years an $8.8 billion grant program for state and local law enforcement agencies to hire or redeploy 100,000 additional officers to perform community policing. The Attorney General established the Of- fice of Community Oriented Policing Serv-ices (COPS) to administer the grant pro-grams and to advance community policing across the country. Management of the COPS grants entails both program and finan-cial management. The COPS office is respon-sible for: (1) developing and announcing grant programs, (2) monitoring pro-grammatic issues related to grants, (3) re-ceiving and reviewing applications, and (4) deciding which grants to award. The Depart-ment of Justice's Office of Justice Programs (OJP) is responsible for financial manage-ment of the COPS program and is charged with: (1) disbursing federal funds to grantees, (2) providing financial management assist-ance after COPS has made an award, (3) re-viewing pre-award and post-award financial activity, (4) reviewing and approving grant budgets, and (5) financial monitoring of COPS awards. In order to meet the President's goal of putting 100,000 additional police officers on the street, COPS developed six primary hir-ing and redeployment grant programs for state and local law enforcement agencies. Hiring grants fund the hiring of additional police officers and generally last for three years. Redeployment grants are generally one-year grants and fund the costs of equip-ment and technology, and support resources (including civilian personnel) to free existing officers from administrative duties and rede-ploy them to the streets. At the end of the grant period, the state or local entity is ex-pected to continue funding the new positions or continue the time savings that resulted from the equipment or technology purchases using its own funds. According to COPS, as of February 1999, COPS and OJP had awarded approximately $5 billion in grants under the six programs to fund the hiring or redeployment of more than 92,000 officers, of which 50,139 officers had been hired and deployed to the streets. COPS obtains its ''on the street'' officer count by periodically contacting grantees by telephone. II. SUMMARY FINDINGS From October 1996 through September 1998, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) per-formed 149 audits of COPS and OJP hiring and redeployment grants totaling $511 mil-lion, or 10 percent of the funds COPS has ob-ligated for the program. We continue to per-form additional grant audits as our resources permit. Executive summaries of these audits are available for public review on our website: <http://www.usdoj.gov/oig>. A com-prehensive program audit of COPS' and OJP's administration of the overall $8.8 bil-lion Community Policing Grant Program is nearing completion and should be issued in the next few months. 1 Our audits focus on: (1) the allowability of grant expenditures; (2) whether local match-ing funds were previously budgeted for law enforcement; (3) the implementation or en-chantment of community policing activities; (4) hiring efforts to fill vacant sworn officer positions; (5) plans to retain officer positions at grant completion; (6) grantee reporting; and (7) analyses of supplanting issues. For the 149 grant audits, we identified about $52 million in questioned costs and about $71 million in funds that could be better used. Our dollar-related findings amount to 24 per-cent of the total funds awarded to the 149 grantees. In considering our COPS audit results, it should be kept in mind that they: (1) Are snapshots as of the grant report's issuance date. Subsequent communication between the auditee and COPS/OJP may re-sult in correction to, or elimination of, the issues noted during our audit; and (2) May well not be representative of the overall universe of grantees because, as a matter of policy, COPS has referred to us for review what it believes to be its riskiest grantees. During FY 1998, we began supplementing COPS requests for audits by selecting about one-half of the grantees our-selves. Our results to date, however, may still be skewed because of the number of au-dits conducted on COPS-requested grantees and because our selections were not entirely random. Some of our audits were also in-tended to be targeted at suspected problem grantees. (Of the 149 audits we performed through September 30, 1998, 103 were referred to us by COPS or OJP. Although we selected only 46 of the 149 audits summarized in this report ourselves, our results to date do not differ markedly from the results in the COPS/OJP referred audits.) It should also be noted that COPS and OJP do not always agree with our findings and recommenda-tions. Upon further review and follow-up, COPS and/or OJP may conclude that, in their judgment, a grant violation did not occur. Other findings include: 20 of 145 grantees (14 percent) overesti- mated salaries and/or benefits in their grant application. The COPS office depends pri-marily on the information provided by the law enforcement departments that submit the grant applications. When grantees over-estimate salaries and/or benefits, COPS over-obligates funds that could be available for use elsewhere. Also, grantees may be using the excess grant funds for purposes that are unallowable. 74 of 146 grantees (51 percent) included un- allowable costs in their claims for reim-bursement. Types of unallowable costs in-clude overtime, uniforms, and fringe benefits not previously approved by OJP. When grantees overstate costs, COPS program costs are overstated and taxpayer money is at risk. 52 of 67 grantees receiving MORE grants (78 percent) either could not demonstrate that they redeployed officers or could not dem-onstrate that they had a system in place to track the redeployment of officers into com-munity policing. The COPS office counts 35,852 officers under the MORE program to-wards the President's goal of adding 100,000 additional officers. 60 of 147 grantees (41 percent) showed indi- cators of using federal funds to supplant local funding instead of using grant funds to supplement local funding. The findings in-cluded budgeting for decreases in local posi-tions after receiving COPS grants (27 grant-ees), using COPS funds to pay for local offi-cers already on board (7 grantees), not filling vacancies promptly (22 grantees), and not meeting the requirements of providing matching funds (35 grantees). When grantees use grant funds to replace local funds rather than to hire new officers, additional officers are not added to the nation's streets. In-stead, federal funds are used to pay for exist-ing police officers. 83 of 144 grantees (58 percent) either did not develop a good faith plan to retain offi-cer positions or said they would not retain the officer positions at the conclusion of the grant. COPS and OJP started awarding com-munity policing grants in FY 1994 and most grants last for about three years. If COPS positions are not retained beyond the conclu-sion of the grant, then COPS will have been a short-lived phenomena, rather than help-ing to launch a lasting change in policing. 106 of 140 grantees (76 percent) either failed to submit COPS initial reports, annual re-ports, or officer progress reports, or sub-mitted these reports late. The reports are critical for COPS to monitor key grant con-ditions such as supplanting and retention. 137 of 146 grantees (94 percent) did not sub- mit all required Financial Status Reports to OJP or submitted them late. Without these reports, OJP cannot monitor implementa-tion of important grant requirements. 33 of 146 grantees (23 percent) had weak- nesses in their community policing program or were unable to adequately distinguish COPS activities from their pre-grant mode of operations. The findings suggest a need for COPS to refine its definition of the practices that constitute community policing as well as those that do not. After we issue our grant reports, COPS, OJP, and the grantee are responsible for en-suring that corrective action is taken. By agreement with COPS, OJP is our primary point of contact on follow-up activity for the grants, although COPS works with OJP to address our audit findings and recommenda-tions, particularly those that indicate sup-planting has occurred. The options available to COPS and OJP to resolve our dollar-re-lated findings and recommendations include: (1) collection or offset of funds, (2) with-holding funds from grantees, (3) bringing the grantee into compliance with grant terms, or (4) concluding that our recommendations cannot or should not be implemented. To ad-dress our non dollar-related findings and rec-ommendations, COPS and OJP can, in addi-tion to other options, bring the grantee into compliance with grant requirements or waive certain grant requirements. When OJP submits documentation to us showing that it has addressed our recommendations, the audit report is closed. The report consists of the body of the re- port; a detailed matrix setting forth the audit findings made during the 149 audits; the response of COPS and OJP to a draft of the report, and our reply to their response.

Mr. President, I am grateful to Senators H ATCH , ALLARD , ASHCROFT , and S ESSIONS who have spent countless hours over the past two Congresses addressing the complex issues of school safety and juvenile vio-lence. And, needless to say, I deeply appre- ciate their accommodating my con-cerns regarding a bill that I regard as among the most significant pieces of legislation to be considered this Con-gress\u2014and for their having included three of my amendments in the man-ager's education package. When enacted, these provisions will improve access to public school dis-ciplinary records by other schools; ex-pand the authority of schools to run a national criminal background check on their employees; and encourage State and local governments to run such checks on all school employees who are charged with providing educational and support services to our children. Together, these provisions will make sure that local public, private, and pa-rochial schools are able to make in-formed decisions about these individ-uals\u2014whether a student, a teacher, or other school employee\u2014who pose an unreasonable risk to the safety and se-curity of our children. Mr. President, we all share a common responsibility to protect our children and a common hope that our children will have a bright future. Though we disagree on the wisdom of creating more gun control laws, there are things that we ought to agree are necessary and in our children's best interests. In this spirit, I introduced a bill in the past two Congresses seeking to ex-tend the provisions of the Gun-Free Schools Act to illegal drugs. This amendment is based on that bill and is cosponsored by the distinguished As-sistant Majority Leader, Mr. N ICKLES , and the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, Mr. T HURMOND . I trust that this amendment will be looked upon favorably by Senators on both sides of the aisle. Mr. President, this amendment will strike an important blow in the war against drugs by helping to protect America's school-children from the scourge of drugs in their classrooms. It does this by requiring States to adopt a low mandating ''zero tolerance'' for illegal drugs at school in order to qual-ify for Elementary and Secondary Edu-cation Act (ESEA) funds. Zero toler-ance is defined as requiring any stu-dent in possession of a felonious quan-tity of this contraband at school to be expelled for not less than one year. Its adoption will finally send a clear un-ambiguous message to students, par-ents, and teachers\u2014drugs and schools do not mix. Anybody who questions the necessity of this measure should consider these excerpts from the 1998 CASA National Survey of Teens, Teachers and Prin-cipals. This outstanding report was VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5710 May 20, 1999 prepared by the National Center on Ad- diction and Substance Abuse at Colum-bia University under the direction of President Carter's former HEW Sec-retary, Joseph Califano. Under the heading ''Drug Dealing In Our Schools'', the report states: For too many kids, school has become not primarily a place for study and learning, but a haven for booze and drugs. . . . Parents should shutter when they learn that 22 per-cent of 12- to 14-year-olds and 51 percent of 15- to 17-year-olds know a fellow student at their school who sells drugs. . . . Indeed, not only do many of them know student drug dealers; often the drug deals take place at school itself. Principals and teachers may claim their schools are drug-free, but a sig-nificant percentage of the students have seen drugs sold on school grounds with their own eyes. . . . In fact, more teenagers report see-ing drugs sold at school (27 percent) than in their own neighborhoods (21 percent). In other places, the report details that students consider drugs to be the number one problem they face and that illegal drugs are readily available to students of all ages. Exacerbating this terrible situation, illegal drugs are not cheaper and more potent than ever be-fore. The CASA report goes on to state that ''one in four teenagers can get acid, cocaine or heroin within 24 hours, and given enough time, almost half (46 percent) would be able to purchase such drugs.'' Clearly, eliminating drugs from America's classrooms is a nec-essary first step to the restoration of order in our schools. The harm that illegal drugs causes our students in incalculable. Though its' ill effects, disruptions, and the vio-lence associated with it are not limited to those actually involved in the drug trade. The PRIDE survey, conducted by the National Parents' Resource Insti-tute for Drug Education, found a link between school violence and drugs when it demonstrated that: Gun-toting students were 23 times more likely to use cocaine; Gang members were 12 times more likely to use cocaine; and Students who threatened others were 6 times more likely to use cocaine than oth-ers. Clearly, the connection between drugs and school violence is an irref-utable as it is frightening. Mr. President, it should seem obvious that many children take guns to school because they are either involved in il-legal activity or because they seek to defend themselves from those who are. It is clear that any further effort to eliminate guns and violence from schools must focus not merely on the gun but on the reasons why students choose to arm themselves. My amend-ment does precisely that. My home state of North Carolina has not been immune to the ravages of ille-gal drugs. In fact, ''possession of a con-trolled substance'' has been either the first or second most reported category of school crime in North Carolina for the past four years. That's according to North Carolina State University's Cen-ter for the Prevention of School Vio-lence, an outstanding organization that tracks the incidence of school crime and suggests ways to prevent it. As bleak as the picture is, there are immediate steps that we can take to reverse course. Those who are on the ''front lines'' of our country's drug war have important things to contribute to the discussion. Overwhelmingly, stu-dents, teachers and parents support the adoption of a zero tolerance policy for drugs at school. Among those surveyed, the CASA study found broad support for the adop-tion of firm policies on random locker searches, drug testing of student ath-letes, and zero tolerance policies. Re-garding zero tolerance, 80% of prin-cipals, 79% of teachers, 73% of teen-agers and 69% of parents voiced sup-port for the adoption of such a policy at their school. Additionally, 85% of principals, 79% of teachers and 82% of students believe that zero tolerance policies are effec-tive at keeping drugs out of schools and that they would actually reduce drugs on their campus. Quoting from the CASA report again: If these students believe them [zero toler- ance policies] so effective, these policies must make an impact on their decisions to not bring drugs on campus. Given this, it seems that schools . . . should implement and strictly enforce zero tolerance policies. Perhaps in doing so they can increase their likelihood of eradicating drugs on their school grounds. It is not my position that this amendment, by itself, will eliminate all drugs from our schools but it is clear that this is a long overdue step in the right direction. This policy is firm but fair. The drug trade and the violence associated with it have no place in America's class-rooms. Schools should foster an envi-ronment that is conducive to learning and supportive of the vast majority of students who want to learn. Children and teachers deserve a school free of the fear and violence caused by drugs. Removing drugs and violence from our schools is a goal that we should all agree on. The President, in his 1997 State of the Union address, said ''we must continue to promote order and discipline'' in America's schools by ''remov[ing] disruptive students from the classroom, and hav[ing] zero toler-ance for guns and drugs in school.'' I could not agree more with the Presi-dent on this point: it is time that the Senate go on record in support of re-moving illegal drugs from America's classrooms, by approving this amend-ment. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, there was yet another tragedy in Atlanta this morning. This is one more violent act that brings America together in sorrow. We hope that it is also an op-portunity to bring us together to learn some important lessons. What are peo-ple\u2014young people especially\u2014saying to us all when they turn to violence to address their problems? This is an American challenge. We all have to do our part\u2014in partnership. We must each do our job, but we must all work together. We in Congress are try- ing to do our part\u2014passing bills, appro-priating funds. But the Congress, like all of us, will do a better job when it really listens to the American people, and listens to young people. Every young person has the capacity to grow up to be a constructive citizen or a vio-lent criminal. It's our job\u2014all of us\u2014to listen better. When we do listen, we find two issues at the core: working in partnership, and improving the tools to help build the adult/child relationship. How do we work together? There are many people who have answered this problem in communities all over the Nation. They abandon turf issues and special interests, they listen, and they remember that the child is at the cen-ter of the work. There are specific things we can learn in Congress from these communities\u2014where to find the money and time and energy to get the work done together. How do we improve the relationships and connections that young people make with adults? It frustrates me that we cannot do some fairly obvious things\u2014for young people, families, teachers, and commu-nities. What can we do for students? Why is it that we can't figure out ways of building meaningful roles for young people in their own education, and in their own community? Why is it that if you are too young to vote, you are not taken seriously or treated as a citizen? Why is that when a child's hand goes up in the classroom, that child can't get the attention he or she needs from a teacher? We can do some simple things. We can ask young people what they think about how to prevent violence. We can reduce class size. We can make sure that when we hire more teachers, we have better and smaller schools in which to put them. We all have a role in making these things happen. What can we do to better support parents and families? We all know that a strong family unit is the engine that drives our economy, and that when it works well, it is the best and cheapest prevention program out there. So why is it so difficult to improve the tools and information available to parents? All parents want to do their best, so why is it off limits to talk about the problems with our economy, to talk about how parents spend too much time at work and not enough time with kids? Why can't we do the simplest things to make life easier for people who work harder and harder to provide for their family and spend less and less time with their kids? We can start with something simple, like making sure parents don't suffer at work just because they want unpaid leave time to go to a school conference, or take care of an emergency at their child's day care. We should improve the Family and Medical Leave Act. Again, there are things we all can do to make these things happen. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5711 May 20, 1999 What can we do for teachers and other educators? Why can't we give them a small enough class so they get to know each child, and can find 5 extra minutes with the child who needs the most help that day? Why do we ex-pect our teachers to deal with every educational and social issue under the Sun, but we can't treat them as profes-sionals? We need to reduce class size. We need to improve teacher training. We need to improve teacher pay and profes-sionalism. And, we need to think about one thing we can each do to act as a re-source to that classroom. Is there a phone call we could make? An edu-cational tool we could buy for the class? A day we could give to working for the passage of the school levy? There are things we all can do. What can we do to help communities support the adult-child relationship, and build connections for young peo-ple? Why is it that we don't have more adults participating in the lives of young people? Why is it that a student can walk from home to school to the mall to the quickie-mart and back home again and feel invisible and anon-ymous? Why can't we allow our com-munities into our public school build-ings at nights and on weekends? We should expand community edu- cation opportunities, and when we offer tax incentives, they should be the right ones that help communities invest in young people. We should each make sure to smile at young people, to keep an eye on them, to set high expecta-tions, and to give them meaningful op-portunities. Again, there are things we all must do. All over America, there is a con- versation going on around the kitchen table, and on the school bus, and at the mall, and around the water-cooler. We need to listen carefully to this con-versation\u2014to what is being said and asked for, and what is not. We need to act carefully, and invest wisely. But, most importantly, each of us need to keep this conversation going\u2014to find out what to do and do it\u2014until we cre-ate the America we want for our chil-dren and young people. And you know one of the best, most overlooked re-sources for building the America we all want? The young people themselves. Let's start by listening to them. The juvenile justice bill fails to fully address these problems. While many amendments have been adopted that focus on the right solutions, we failed to achieve support for most of those that would have focused this legisla-tion on those things that could best solve youth violence. With that said, I will vote for the bill because I believe it has many positive provisions that combat youth violence. The bill provides important block grants to States to assist them in their efforts to address juvenile crime. While I prefer a high percentage of these funds be required for prevention, I know my State of Washington intends to continue to invest in steering kids away from crime through proven com- munity-based prevention programs. The bill also provides for Internet fil-tering and screening software that will allow parents to regulate what their children are viewing over the Internet. It also made transfers of several types of firearms to children illegal. As I have already said, I agree with many of my colleagues who have said that there is no legislative ''quick fix'' to this terrible problem that is de-stroying so many young lives. The issue of youth violence involves com-plex and interrelated factors. From prevention programs that involve par-ents, teachers and communities, to strong law enforcement measures, there are many different tools we must use to attack the problem from all an-gles and prevent further tragedies like the one in Littleton. We must punish those who commit crimes, but we must also do all we can to prevent crimes before they happen, to intervene before small problems grow to crisis proportions. We must give schools and law enforcement offi-cers the tools they need to identify the warning signs that lead to juvenile vio-lence and to let youth know that crime is not an acceptable answer. While the bill does contain a ''pre- vention block grant,'' there is no guar-antee the money will be used for pre-vention. Dollars from these grants could be used to build more prisons or increase enforcement. While these are laudable goals, without a guaranteed set-aside for prevention, a State could fail to attack youth violence before it starts. We must reach out to prevent at-risk youth from starting down a path of crime in the first place. While we were unable to secure specific amounts for prevention, I am hopeful that States will use their discretion and undertake prevention programs. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Some of my colleagues have offered amendments to provide resources for effective violence prevention, and I am disappointed they have not been adopt-ed. Last week, Senator R OBBoffered an amendment that would have provided funds for schools and law enforcement to identify and effectively respond to juvenile violent behavior. It would have established a National Clearing-house of School Safety Information and provided an anonymous hotline to report criminal behavior and a support line for schools and communities to call for assistance. In addition, the Robb amendment would have provided treatment pro-grams that identify and address the symptoms of youth violence to steer juveniles away from criminal behavior. It also would have provided authoriza-tion for afterschool programs, which have been very effective at keeping high-risk youth off the street and in-volved in activities that assist in their education and growth. I am hopeful that similar legislation will be offered again and that my col-leagues will reconsider and give it their support. In addition to my disappointment at the lack of adequate resources for vio-lence prevention, I have other concerns about this bill. I am very concerned about the fate of our youth serving time in prisons and other detention facilities. While we must certainly punish those who have committed crimes, we must make a se-rious attempt at rehabilitation and not allow juveniles to turn into hardened criminals in the course of their incar-ceration. It is well-known that juve-niles who have contact with adults in prison are further indoctrinated into a life of crime or worse, assaulted or even killed. Current requirements pro-hibit juveniles, whether they were tried as adult or juveniles, from being kept in any adult jail or corrections in-stitution where they have regular con-tact with adult inmates. The Hatch bill weakens that stand- ard by allowing ''incidental'' contact and permitting construction of juvenile facilities on the same site as those for adults. Even convicted juveniles should be protected from hardened criminals. Those youth who are the most success-ful in a mixed juvenile-adult environ-ment will be the ones we will least want back on the streets once they have served their time. It is my under-standing that the Feinstein-Chafee amendment improved this provision, for which I am thankful, increasing protection of our children while they are in state custody. I also feel the Hatch bill critically weakens measures to address dis-proportionate minority confinement. The legislation replaces references to ''minority'' or ''race'' with the vague phrase ''segments of the juvenile popu-lation.'' Further, the Hatch bill is less instructive on what must be done to address the problem of discrimination, essentially making the issue a mere concern rather than a problem we must correct. This is the wrong direction to be heading if we truly seek to achieve fair and unbiased treatment of all peo-ple within the judicial system. An amendment to correct this problem was defeated. The Hatch bill also contains very troublesome provisions to allow the prosecution of children as young as 14 as adults, and gives prosecutors\u2014not judges\u2014the discretion to try a juvenile as an adult. Judges make judgments; prosecutors prosecute. It is obvious who is better qualified to render an un-biased decision on whether a 14-year- old should be considered an adult. There is another idea missing from this bill. To solve youth violence we must all talk to the true experts: young people themselves. We need to listen to more than the student body presidents and the class valedictorians. We need to hear from ''regular'' kids. I know that I have learned a tremen- dous amount from doing that. Two weeks ago, I met with 10th graders in Kent, WA who told me some shocking VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5712 May 20, 1999 things. They said that nearly all of them knew where they could get a gun within a day. That is a sad statement abut the lives of our youth. They are afraid and they are thinking about how to defend themselves with a gun. In the end, we were able, through the Lautenberg amendment on gun shows, to close one of the more glaring loop-holes that allow young people and chil-dren to get guns. After much flip-flop on the issue by Republicans, a handful of their courageous Members lent enough support to this amendment by Senator L AUTENBERG to close some of these guns show loopholes, but this was not until they had tried two amend-ments of substance on the issue. Fur-thermore, it took the Vice President of the United States, acting in his role as the President of the Senate, to cast the final vote to break the tie that will help keep kids and guns separate. Overall, S. 254 does much to tackle the tough questions surrounding juve-nile justice. But as I have stated, there are a number of ways we could have improved this bill. We need to focus on preventive measures that bring to-gether parents, kids, counselors and teachers; provide resources to enable people to identify and intervene in po-tentially dangerous situations; and give law enforcement the tools it needs to deal with the symptoms of youth vi-olence not just the results of the vio-lence. I hope in the future we can pass legis- lation that will address the remaining problems and can come up with even better solutions. We owe that much to our children. Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am vot- ing in favor of the juvenile crime bill, S. 254, because on balance it comes close enough to promoting the kind of approach that we need to reduce juve-nile violence\u2014the type of plan that is already working to reduce crime in cit-ies like Milwaukee and Boston, and the type of strategy that will help us pre-vent future tragedies like the recent school shootings in Jonesboro, AR, Peducah, KY, Springfield, OR, Conyers, GA and Littleton, CO. There are many causes of juvenile crime\u2014poverty, a de-terioration of American families and family values, increased youth access to firearms, and the explosion of vio-lent images in our culture, just to name a few\u2014and it would be naive to presume there is a simple solution. In-deed, we need a comprehensive crime- fighting strategy to address all of these root causes and the entire range of ju-venile offenders and potential offend-ers, from violent predators to children at-risk of becoming delinquent. That is the approach this bill takes, more or less. Let me explain the four keys to this balanced, proven strategy: keeping guns out of the hands of kids and of criminals; punishment; prevention; and reducing kids' exposure to violence in our culture. First, this bill will help keep fire- arms out of the hands of young people. It promotes gun safety with the Kohl/ Hatch/Chafee amendment to require the sale of child safety locks with every new handgun. Child safety locks can help save many of the 500 children and teenagers killed each year in fire-arms accidents, and the 1,500 kids each year who use guns to commit suicide. Just as importantly, they can help pre-vent some of the 7,000 violent juvenile crimes committed every year with guns children took from their own homes. This measure passed with an overwhelming 78 votes, twice the num-ber of votes a virtually identical pro-posal received last year. The bill also helps identify who is supplying kids with guns, so we can put them out of business and behind bars. Through the ''Youth Crime Gun Inter-diction Initiative,'' the Bureau of Alco-hol, Tobacco and Firearms has been working closely with cities like Mil-waukee and Boston to trace guns used by young people back to the source. Using ATF's national database, police and prosecutors can target illegal sup-pliers of firearms and help stop the flow of firearms into our communities. While I served as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee for Treasury Appro-priations, we provided funding to ex-pand this initiative to 27 cities. This measure will expand the program to up to 200 other cities and, with the in-creased penalties outlined above, help stanch illegal gun trafficking. And not only will this bill prohibit all violent criminals from owning fire-arms, no matter what their age, through ''Project CUFF'' it also en-courages aggressive enforcement of this federal law by dedicating federal prosecutors and investigators to this task. This builds on a successful pro-gram, supported by the NRA, that has helped reduce gun violence in Rich-mond, Va., and Boston through in-creased federal prosecution, close co-ordination with state officials, public outreach and fewer plea bargains. Still, to be truly effective, this measure needs to be improved, so that we don't force it on uncooperating cities where it's unlikely to succeed. Unfortunately, the bill fails in its stated intent to close an inexcusable loophole that allows violent young of-fenders to buy guns legally when they turn eighteen. Under current law, vio-lent adult offenders can't buy firearms, but violent juveniles can\u2014for example, even the kids convicted of the school-yard killings in Jonesboro, Arkansas\u2014 once they are released at age eighteen. Simply put, this has to stop, and the bill tries to do this\u2014sort of. A provi-sion declares that all violent felons are disqualified from buying firearms, re-gardless of whether they were 10, 12, or just a day short of their 18th birthday at the time of their offense. However, although the bill technically closes this loophole, because it only applies to violent crimes committed once juve-nile records become ''routinely avail-able'' on-line, its indefinite effective date merely opens another loophole in its place. This provision may never take effect. When juvenile records are all ''on-line'' is a long way away, and in the meantime many young criminals will continue to have the ability to get a gun at 18 once they get out of jail. Each of these provisions was ad- dressed in my juvenile crime bill, the 21st Century Safe and Sound Commu-nities Act. In addition, after much back-and-forth\u2014and forth-and-back\u2014 we finally agreed to close the gun show loophole once and for all. I am pleased to see a bipartisan consensus start to emerge over taking these steps to keep guns out of young hands. Second, we need to lock up the worst offenders, including dangerous violent juveniles. Naturally, we can't even begin to stop violent kids unless we have police officers on the street to catch them, and the state and local prosecutors, defense attorneys and courts we need to try them. To that end, this bill provides $100 million per year for state and local prosecutors, defense attorneys and courts for juve-niles. Unfortunately, we missed an op-portunity to extend the highly success-ful COPS program\u2014which is due to ex-pire after next year\u2014in this bill. Ex-tending the COPS program will make it easier to lock up dangerous juve-niles, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to make that hap-pen. Of course, we can't keep criminals off the streets unless we have a place to send them. So this measure dedicates funding for juvenile prisons or alter-native placements of delinquent chil-dren\u2014a long-needed measure for which I have advocated since before the 1994 Crime Act. This proposal also helps rural com- munities keep dangerous kids behind bars. Now, although the closest juve-nile facility may be hundreds of miles away, federal law prohibits rural police from locking up violent juveniles in adult jails for more than 24 hours. This means that state law enforcement offi-cials either have to waste the time and resources to criss-cross the state even for initial court appearances, or simply let dangerous teens go free. In my view, that's a no-win situation. This measure gives rural police the flexi-bility they need by letting them detain juveniles in adult jails for up to 48 hours, or longer with parental consent, provided they are separated from adult criminals. Working with Wisconsin's rural sheriffs, I first proposed a similar extension three years ago. Moreover, this measure will help lock up gun-toting kids\u2014and the peo-ple who illegally supply them with weapons. It builds on my 1994 Youth Handgun Safety Act by turning illegal possession of a handgun by a minor into a felony. And the same goes for anyone who illegally sells handguns to kids. Both of these provisions were in my juvenile crime bill. Kids and hand-guns don't mix, and our Federal law needs to make clear that this is a seri-ous crime. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov \u2014 SENATE S5713 May 20, 1999 In addition, this measure makes it easier to identify the violent juveniles who need to be dealt with more se-verely\u2014by strongly encouraging states to share the records of juvenile offend-ers and providing the funding nec-essary for improved record-keeping. The fact is that law enforcement offi-cials need full disclosure to make in- formed judgments about who should be incarcerated, but current law allows too many records to be concealed or to vanish without a trace when a teen felon turns eighteen. Finally, this measure includes my proposal, cosponsored by Senator D EWINE: the Violent Offender DNA Identification Act of 1999, which will promote the use of modern DNA tech-nology to resolve unsolved crimes com-mitted by both juveniles and adults. Our measure will reduce the backlog of hundreds of thousands of unanalyzed DNA samples from convicted offenders by providing the funding necessary to analyze them and put them ''on-line,'' so they can be shared between states and matched with crime scene DNA evidence. And, while all 50 states au-thorize collection of DNA samples, it closes the loophole that allows DNA samples from Federal and Washington, D.C. offenders to go uncollected. The Department of Justice estimates that upgrading our DNA databases alone could solve a minimum of 600 crimes tomorrow. Third, a balanced approach also re- quires a significant investment in crime prevention, so we can stop crime before it's too late. In fact, no one is more adamant in support of this ap-proach than our nation's law enforce-ment officials. For example, last year more than 400 police chiefs, sheriffs and prosecutors nationwide endorsed a call for after-school programs for all chil-dren. And in my home state of Wis-consin, 90 percent of police chiefs and sheriffs I surveyed agreed that we need to increase federal prevention spend-ing. This proposal promotes prevention by concentrating funding in programs that already have a record of success and those that rely on proven strate-gies, like the ones that give children a safe place to go in the after-school hours between 3 and 8 p.m., when juve-nile crime peaks. For example, it includes my amend- ment to expand the Families and Schools Together (FAST) program, a successful program that finds troubled youth and reconnects them with their schools and families. FAST, which was created in my home state of Wisconsin and is already being implemented in 484 schools in 34 States and five coun-tries, helps ensure that youth violence does not proliferate to our schools and communities by empowering parents, helping to improve children's behavior and performance in school, preventing substance abuse, and providing support and networking for families by linking them to community resources and services. The bill also promotes innovative prevention initiatives by reauthorizing and expanding the Prevention Chal-lenge Grant program (formerly known as Title V), which former Senator Hank Brown and I authored in 1992. This program encourages investment, collaboration, and long-range preven-tion planning by local communities, who must establish locally tailored prevention programs and contribute at least 50 cents for every federal dollar. And, in response to concerns I raised about the risk of watering down this program with non-prevention uses, 80 percent of its funding is reserved for prevention\u2014that is, programs address-ing at-risk kids before they ever enter the juvenile justice system. It also builds on our support for the valuable work of Boys & Girls Clubs by continuing to dedicate funding to the Clubs and expanding funding to other successful organizations like the YMCA. And it requires that at least 25 percent of $450 million juvenile ac-countability block grant be dedicated to prevention. Of course, we shouldn't blindly invest in prevention programs, just because they sound good. Quality matters. And it would foolish to throw good money after bad. That's why this measure re-quires at least 5 percent of all Preven-tion Challenge Grant funds\u2014and more than 15 percent of FAST funds\u2014be set aside for rigorous evaluations, so we can keep funding the programs that work, and zero out programs that don't. Finally, this bill also aims to provide us with a better understanding of how violence in our culture is marketed to children, and it encourages industry to take self-regulatory steps to reduce this violence. For example, the Brown-back amendment, which I consponsored, orders a joint FTC/DOJ study of the marketing practices of the video game, motion picture, and tele-vision industries to determine whether or not the industries are peddling vio-lence to kids. In particular, it will help us determine whether or not the indus-tries are peddling violence to kids. In particular, it will help us determine whether the video game industry is marketing the same ultraviolent games to children that are rated ''adults only.'' Mr. President, while explaining what causes a tragedy like Littleton remains a mystery, the question about how to reduce juvenile crime no longer is. We have a good idea about what works. And this bill overall is a step in the right direction. Like any piece of legis-lation, of course, it isn't perfect. For example, we need to really close the loophole that allows violent juvenile offenders to buy guns. We need to ex-tend the COPS program so that we have enough police officers on the streets to catch and lock up dangerous juveniles and criminals. We should re-store the so-called ''mandate'' requir-ing states to make efforts to reduce disproportionate minority confine-ment. This requirement, which I helped write in 1992, at most simply encour-ages states to address prevention ef-forts at minority communities. And it may be most important for its sym-bolic recognition of continuing racial divisions that dominate our society and our justice system, whether or not the justice system is actually discrimi-natory. Still, it makes no sense to cast away this provision without any hear-ings, any organized opposition, or any constitutional challenges to it over its seven-year history. I am hopeful that the House, which has always been sup-portive of this provision, will insist on restoring it in Conference. And while the bill is a step forward for prevention, we can still do better. Although some suggest that as much as 55 percent of the $1 billion in spend-ing at the heart of the bill goes toward prevention, in reality less than 30 per-cent is dedicated to prevention ($160 million through the 80 percent set- aside of the Prevention Challenge Grant, $112.5 million through the 25 percent earmark from the Account-ability Block Grant, and $15 million for mentoring). To effectively reduce juve- nile crime, the ratio of prevention spending to enforcement spending has to be a lot higher. Finally, Mr. President, I express my appreciation to Senators H ATCH and LEAHY , and their staffs\u2014Beryl Howell, Manus Cooney, Rhett DeHart, Mike Kennedy, Bruce Cohen, Ed Pagano, Craig Wolf, and, of course, Brian Lee, Jessica Catlin, Kahau Morrison and Jon Leibowitz of my staff\u2014for their hard work in putting together this bal-anced bill, which is significant im-provement from where we were headed last Congress. I look forward to con-tinuing to work with them when we move to conference. Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of final passage and explain why I plan to vote for final pas-sage of S. 254, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Accountability and Rehabilitation Act of 1999. At the out-set, I must make clear that I do not support every provision in this bill. There is much in this bill that is sim-ply extraneous\u2014provisions that do not address the problem of youth violence. Moreover, there are items included in this bill by amendment that I opposed. There are also items that were in-cluded through the manager's amend-ment, such as the creation of new fed-eral judgeships, that I oppose. However, there are many provisions in this bill that I have long cham-pioned and have worked hard to in-clude in the bill. Let me briefly sum-marize these key provisions of this law: ASHCROFT PROVISIONS IN S . 254 There are four main Ashcroft initia- tives in the core Senate juvenile jus-tice bill, S. 254. Those provisions are: (1) Trying juveniles as adults on the federal level, (2) targeting adults who use juveniles through increased pen-alties, (3) funding for improving juve-nile record system and incentives for VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, S5714 May 20, 1999 recordsharing, and (4) Charitable choice\u2014preventing discrimination against faith-based organizations that stand ready to provide counseling to troubled youth. First, the core bill makes it easier for federal prosecutors to try juveniles as adults in federal court. Specifically, the bill provides local United States Attorneys with new authority to try juveniles 14 and older who commit vio-lent federal crimes and federal drug crimes as adults. This provision is an important improvement in the law. Violent federal crimes and major fed-eral drug crimes are not youthful indis-cretions or juvenile pranks\u2014these are serious adult crimes. The bill makes important steps to ensure that in the federal system juveniles who commit adult crimes do adult time. Second, the core bill also targets adults who would exploit children and ensnare them into a life of crime. One sad consequence of a juvenile justice system that treats juvenile crime less seriously than adult crime is that adults try to game the system by using juveniles to perform criminal tasks with the greatest risk of detection. Adults use children as drug runners or couriers precisely because the children are likely to end up back on the street even if they are caught. The core bill addresses this problem by including two provisions from my Protect Chil-dren from Violence Act, S. 2023, from the last Congress. Specifically, section 202 increases the mandatory minimums for adults who use juveniles to commit drug crimes from 1 year to 3 years for first-time offenders and from 1 year to 5 years for repeat offenders. Section 203 doubles the penalties on adults who use juveniles to commit crimes of violence and trebles penalties for repeat offend-ers. The core bill also includes important provisions to facilitate the sharing of juvenile criminal records. This legisla-tion encourages States to keep records on violent juveniles that are the equiv-alent of the records kept for adults committing comparable crimes. In ad-dition, the bill conditions the avail-ability of federal funds on States' par-ticipation in a nationwide system for collecting and sharing juvenile crimi-nal records. Under the bill, state au-thorities must make these criminal records available to federal and state law enforcement officials and school officials to assist them in providing for the best interests of all students and preventing more tragedies. Providing judges and school officials with accu-rate records is a critical step in pre-venting tragedies. School officials and judges have a right and a need to know when they are dealing with dangerous juveniles. Providing accurate records is not only an important role for the gov-ernment, it is a role that only the fed-eral government can fulfill. Violent ju-veniles routinely cross state lines. The federal government has an important role in ensuring that their criminal records cross state lines with them. Finally, the core bill includes my provision ensuring that faith-based or-ganizations have an equal opportunity to provide services to at-risk youth. The experience of the past decade has made clear that government does not have all the answers for what ails our culture. No organizations should be ex-cluded from the process of trying to heal our violent culture, let alone faith-based organizations. The ''chari-table choice'' provisions in the bill do not provide for any special treatment for faith-based organizations, but they do ensure that faith-based groups will not be arbitrarily excluded when the government turns to non-governmental organizations to deal with at-risk juve-niles. The bill in its current form also in- cludes a number of important provi-sions that were added by amendment. These include: Semi-automatic assault rifles ban for juveniles. The Senate overwhelmingly adopted this Ashcroft amendment. The amendment had three major provi-sions: (1) Ban on juvenile possession of semi-automatic assault rifles. This provision extends the current limita-tions (subject to the current excep-tions) on youth possession of handguns to semi-automatic assault weapons. The provision does not affect a juve-nile's right to possess hunting rifles. (2) Requirement that juveniles be tried as adults for weapons violations in a school zone. Juveniles who commit firearms violations near a school zone must be sent a clear message\u2014such ac-tions will not be tolerated and will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. (3) Increased penalties for unlawfully transferring a firearm to a juvenile with knowledge that it will be used in a crime of violence. ASHCROFT EDUCATION PACKAGE The Senate overwhelmingly approved this comprehensive amendment which reflects not only specific Ashcroft ini-tiatives but the work product of the Republican Education Task Force, which Senator A SHCROFT chaired. The major Ashcroft initiatives in the pack-age include: (1) Flexibility for local schools to ad- dress school violence. This provision provides schools with the flexibility to use existing education funds, and the new education funds included in the Republican budget, to address security concerns as they see fit. Permissible uses include everything from the in-stallation of metal detectors, to the formulation of inter-agency task forces, to the introduction of school uniform policies. (2) School uniforms. Another Ashcroft provision makes clear that nothing in federal law prevents local school districts from instituting school uniform policies. (3) School records. Another provision makes clear that student disciplinary records should follow students to a new school, without regard to whether it is public or private. Teachers and admin- istrators need to know who they are dealing with and whether they have se-curity risks in their midst. FRIST -ASHCROFT IDEA AMENDMENT This amendment removes a loophole in federal law that prevents States from disciplining an IDEA student in the same manner as a non-IDEA stu-dent, if an IDEA student brings a gun to school. The Senate passed this com-mon sense amendment 74-25. A number of my colleagues also added my initia-tives to the bill through their own amendments. These include: HATCH /CRAIG COMPREHENSIVE CRIME PACKAGE This amendment included a number of Ashcroft mandatory minimums. Spe-cifically, Ashcroft provisions in the bill raised mandatory minimums: (1) From 1 to 3 years for distributing drugs near a school zone (from 1 to 5 years for subsequent offenses). This provision was adopted from A SHCROFT 's Protect Children from Violence Act, S. 2023. (2) From 1 to 3 years for distributing drugs to a juvenile (1 to 5 years for sub-sequent offenses). This provision was adopted from A SHCROFT 's Protect Chil- dren from Violence Act, S. 2023. (3) From 7 to 10 years for brandishing a firearm during the commission of a federal crime. This provision was adopted from A SHCROFT 's Juvenile Mis- use of Firearms Prevention Act, S. 994. (4) From 10 to 12 years for dis- charging a firearm during the commis-sion of a federal crime. This provision was adopted from A SHCROFT 's Juvenile Misuse of Firearms Prevention Act, S. 994. The amendment also included two new Ashcroft mandatory minimum sentences also adopted from S. 994: (1) A 15-year mandatory minimum for maiming or injuring someone with a firearm during the commission of a federal crime (2) A 5-year mandatory minimum for transferring a firearm with knowledge that it will be used in a crime of vio-lence. HATCH /FEINSTEIN GANG AMENDMENT The Senate also overwhelmingly passed the Hatch-Feinstein amendment designed to target and punish gang vio-lence. The amendment included many provisions long-championed by A SHCROFT , including almost the en- tirety of the gang subtitle of A SHCROFT 's ''Protect Children from Vi- olence Act,'' S. 538, introduced on March 4, 1999. Specifically, the amendment in- cluded the following Ashcroft provi-sions: enhanced sentences for crimes committed as part of gang violence, new crimes for interstate gang activi-ties, the treatment of juvenile crimes as adult crimes for purposes of the fed-eral laws imposing severe penalties on armed career criminals, and increased penalties for witness tampering. All of these provisions were included in the ''Combating Gang Violence'' subtitle of A SHCROFT 's Juvenile Crime bill. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5715 May 20, 1999 In summary, this is not a perfect bill. There is much that is extraneous and some that is misguided. I am hopeful some of these provisions will be re-moved in conference. On balance, how-ever, this bill will help make our schools places of learning, not places of fear. Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to final passage of S. 254, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Account-ability and Rehabilitation Act of 1999. I do so because I believe that the gun control amendments to this bill that have been adopted by the Senate will do lasting damage to the fundamental right to keep and bear arms, which is guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. I am outraged, Mr. President, that the gun control lobby in this country has taken advantage of the tragedy last month at Littleton, Colorado, as well as the incident today in Georgia, to mount an unprecedented assault on the Second Amendment rights of law- abiding gun owners. They cast blame on law-abiding gun owners, while leav-ing the movie moguls and video game makers who promote wanton violence to children virtually unscathed. Frankly, Mr. President, I am also disappointed by some of my colleagues in my own political party here in the Senate. I have spent a great deal of time, over the past two weeks as the Senate has debated this bill, arguing privately with these colleagues and trying to persuade them to hold the line against this onslaught of gun con-trol amendments. Sadly, Mr. President, I have not been successful. Neverthe-less, I am proud to have stood up for the Second Amendment, even, in one case, when I was only one of two Sen-ators to vote against a gun control amendment to this bill. I am particularly angered, Mr. Presi- dent, by what the Senate has voted to do with respect to gun shows. Sadly, it seems evident to me that the practical effect of the Lautenberg Amendment, adopted earlier today when Vice Presi-dent G OREcast the tie-breaking vote, will be effectively to ruin gun shows\u2014 to put them out of business. This, un-fortunately, seems to me to be the aim of the Lautenberg Amendment. I am also deeply concerned about the effects of the so-called ''trigger lock'' amendment. Even though the amend-ment appears only to require trigger locks to be sold with guns, the legal ef-fect of the amendment may well be to do great damage to the Second Amend-ment rights of law-abiding gun owners. This is because courts may construe the amendment as creating a new civil negligence standard under which gun owners will be seen as having a legal obligation to use their trigger locks or face legal liability if their gun is mis-used by some third party. If, in fact, the law develops such that gun owners have a legal obligation to use trigger locks, these law-abiding gun owners may be forced to put their safety, and that of their families, at risk. It is certainly not unreasonable to imagine a single mother of small children, depending on her gun for safe- ty, panic-stricken as she struggles un-successfully with her trigger lock in the middle of the night after hearing a burglar break into her home. Mr. President, these are but two ex- amples of the grave harm that the gun control amendments adopted to this bill by the Senate have done to the Second Amendment rights of Ameri-cans. When the heat of this moment is gone, and the passions so shamelessly stirred up by the gun control lobby have subsided, I am afraid that many of those who supported these amend-ments will realize that they have done the Second Amendment serious and lasting harm. Sadly, though, it will be too late. Mr. President, I yield the floor. AMENDMENT NO . 322 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue raised by the Hatch amendment number 322, which the Senate agreed to on Tuesday, May 11. While I support both the underlying bill and this amendment, I am con-cerned about a portion of this amend-ment which is within the jurisdiction of the Senate Committee on the Budg-et. The Hatch amendment contained language which amends that portion of the 1994 Crime Bill which created the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund. This portion of the amendment does two things: (1) it extends the fund through fiscal year 2005 and (2) it ex-tends the discretionary spending limits (albeit indirectly) through fiscal year 2005 for the violent crime reduction category. As a result, the amendment was subject to a point of order pursu-ant to section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 because it contained matter within the jurisdiction of the Budget Committee and was offered to a bill that was not reported by the com-mittee. I chose not to challenge this provision because I support the under-lying legislation and I have been as-sured by the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH , that my concerns will be addressed when the bill goes to conference. Let me begin by saying that I sup- port full funding for crime fighting ef-forts. I am, however, troubled by this amendment because\u2014in its attempt to ensure funds are available for these im-portant programs it has stumbled into a series of, as yet, unresolved issues re-garding the budget process: should the discretionary spending limits be ex-tended beyond fiscal year 2002? If yes, should there be limits within the over-all cap for items such as defense, high-ways and mass transit, and crime? Cur-rent law (section 251(c) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985) provides limits on discre-tionary spending (the ''caps'') through the end of fiscal year 2002. When the issue of the caps was last addressed during deliberations on the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Congress decided that the overall caps on discre-tionary spending would end after 2002, that the defense cap would end after 1999, and that the crime cap would end after 2000. This was decided as part of a very carefully crafted compromise be-tween the Congress and the President, involving both mandatory and discre-tionary spending, that has now led us to a balanced budget. Our ability to live within these discretionary caps has played a significant role in pro-ducing not only a balanced budget, but surplus for the foreseeable future. Thus I feel it is not appropriate at this time to extend only the crime cap without addressing the broader issue of the ap-propriate level of discretionary spend-ing. Moreover, I fear that raising the issue of the caps at this time will un-necessarily complicate the passage of this important juvenile justice legisla-tion. I know that I do not have to remind my colleagues how difficult it is going to be both this year and next to pass all 13 appropriations bills and stay within the caps which we currently have in place for the next three years. While I am supportive of funding for criminal justice programs, I am con-cerned that extending the crime cap will only make an already difficult task that much harder. I might also point out to my colleagues that by ex-tending only the crime cap and not the overall cap, this legislation has the ef-fect of limiting crime spending for fis-cal years 2003 through 2005 when there will be no such limits upon any other type of discretionary spending. I thank my colleague from Utah, Senator H ATCH , for recognizing my concern with this amendment and I look forward to working with him on this issue when the bill is in con-ference. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to thank the distinguished man-agers of this bill, Senators L EAHY and HATCH , for including the Feinstein- Chafee amendment regarding separa-tion of juveniles from adults in custody in the managers' ''technical amend-ment.'' I also wish to thank Senators A KAKA , FEINGOLD , KOHL, and J EFFORDS , who agreed to co-sponsor our amend-ment, for their support. This amendment resolves a major concern that many, many people had with this bill, and will help speed the way to its final passage. Our amendment is designed to strengthen the bill's requirements for separating juveniles in custody from adult criminals. We should not be counter-productive by allowing juve-nile detention to be a school for crime, nor should we be cruel in permitting the victimization of youths by hard-ened adult criminals. Under current law, juveniles cannot have any contact with adult inmates. None whatsoever. When a juvenile is in an adult facility, that juvenile cannot be within ''sight or sound'' of any adult\u2014ever! VerDate Mar 15 2010 \u2014 SENATE S5716 May 20, 1999 Why is that one of the four so-called ''core'' requirements? Because I remind my colleagues that we are talking about children. Children who may or may not have committed a violent offense. Children who may have been arrested for the first time. Children who perhaps are on the wrong path but most likely never com-mit another offense ever: statistically, over two-thirds of juveniles arrested never commit another crime. In the early 1970s, before there were protections for children who came into contact with our court system, a num-ber of studies found that children in adult jails were subject to rape, as-sault, sodomy, murder, and other acts which sometimes, frankly too often, led to suicide. The Judiciary Committee at the time learned of numerous tragedies and out-right atrocities, including a report on practices in Philadelphia which esti-mated that 2,000 sexual assaults oc-curred inside adult jails or ''sheriff's vans'' used to transport juvenile and adults to court over a 26-month period. One juvenile was raped five times while inside such a van. The numbers tell the story. Children in adult jails are 8 times more likely to commit suicide; 5 times more likely to be sexually assaulted; twice as likely to be assaulted by staff; and 50 percent more likely to be attacked with a weapon than are children in juvenile facilities, according to studies by the Justice Department and others. In my state of California, we passed our laws to keep juveniles out of adult jails in the mid-1980s in the wake of tragedies such as the case of Kathy Robbins, a 15-year-old girl who hung herself when she was placed in an adult jail in Glenn County for violating a ju-venile curfew. After those reports were released, Congress enacted the Juvenile Justice Delinquency Prevention Act and subse-quent renewals of the law to ensure that children would be treated fairly by the juvenile justice system and be kept safely away from adults in jail. Kentucky chose to forgo Federal money and continue placing juveniles in adult jails. This chart shows the re-sult: four suicides, one attempted sui-cide, two physical assaults by other in-mates, two sexual assaults by other in-mates, and one rape by a deputy coun-ty jailer. Let me give you some of the names behind the numbers: In Oldham County, 15-year-old Rob- ert Lee Horn, Jr. was put in jail for truancy and beyond parental control. He was paraded through the jail in front of adult inmates who called out to him for sex. He hung himself. In McCracken County, a 16-year-old Todd Selke was put in adult jail for being a runaway and disorderly con-duct. He committed suicide. In Franklin County, a 16-year-old runaway was raped by a deputy county jailer. The core protections help to prevent these tragedies elsewhere around the country. Yet, this bill as introduced would have weakened the core protections for children. I was puzzled by why the au-thors felt the need to weaken the cur-rent standard. According to the latest figures from the Justice Department, 48 of the 50 states are in compliance with the current standard for sepa-rating children from adults, including such large, rural states as Alaska and Montana. And yet this bill would have allowed for juveniles to be in close proximity to adult inmates. While it generally pro-hibits physical contact between juve-niles and adults in custody, there is an exclusion. And the exclusion to the def-inition of prohibited physical contact said that the term ''does not include supervised proximity between a juve-nile and an adult inmate that is brief and incidental or accidental.'' In other words, it permitted regular contact, planned contact, between de-linquent juveniles and adult criminals, as long as it is deemed to be ''brief and incidental.'' Senator C HAFEE and I were concerned that this standard would have allowed juveniles to be paraded in front of adult inmates as they are being trans-ported from one area of a facility to another. That means that every day the same youth could be required to walk by the adult cell block. Adult inmates would have a chance to tease, taunt, harass, use suggestive body language, expose areas of their private parts, spit, and otherwise scare juveniles as they are being transported through the facility. Now some might think that's OK. That to scare a child by exposing them to adults may reduce the likelihood of the child committing another crime. But, actually, these young children who might be tough on the outside, but not so tough on the inside, could be scared to death\u2014meaning scared enough to commit suicide\u2014just as Robbie Horn was in Oldham County, Kentucky. Older gang members, or veteranos, could pass messages on to younger gang members to coordinate criminal activities, or to intimidate them from turning state's evidence. The amendment which we have agreed upon remedied this. In fact, it is even better than what Senator C HAFEE and I originally proposed. It makes two changes, which bring the bill into line with the current Justice Department regulations: 1. It eliminates any planned or reg- ular contact between juvenile delinquents and adult criminals by changing the exception to ''brief and inadvertent, or accidental,'' contact. The minority report to last Congress' juvenile crime bill, S. 10, erroneously stated that the Justice Department's regulations, like the bill, excepted ''brief and incidental'' contact. How-ever, there is a world of difference be-tween ''incidental'' and ''inadvertent.'' Changing this exception to the Justice Department standard has the same ef-fect as the amendment which Senator C HAFEE and I originally proposed, and will provide much greater protection for juveniles in custody. 2. The amendment passed in the man- ager's package then goes even further, limiting even this exception to non-residential areas only. In other words, there is no exception at all in residen-tial areas to the prohibition on phys-ical contact between juveniles and adults. Specifically, the amendment provides that the inadvertent/acci-dental exception applies only ''in se-cure areas of a facility that are not dedicated to use by juvenile offenders and that are nonresidential, which may include dining, recreational, edu-cational, vocational, health care, entry areas, and passageways.'' This lan-guage is taken almost verbatim from the Justice Department regulations. This amendment ensures that a juve- nile cannot be in close proximity such as supervised ''brief and incidental'' pa-rades by adult cells or other planned or spontaneous actions by adults to trans-port children from one area of a jail to another. Our amendment was endorsed by: The Department of Justice; the Chil-dren's Defense Fund; the National Net-work for Youth; and the National Col-laboration for Youth, an alliance of 28 youth service groups, including Boy Scouts, 4-H, Girl Scouts, American Red Cross, National Urban League, United Way and YMCA. A coalition of 22 other organizations wrote to the Majority Leader, asking that the standard for separating delin-quent juveniles and adult criminals be strengthened, including: Minorities in Law Enforcement, National Associa-tion for School Psychologists, National Council of Churches of Christ-Wash-ington Office, the Alliance for Children and Families, Campaign for an Effec-tive Crime Policy, and Covenant House. With the passage of this amendment, we have provided this protection, and substantially improved this bill. Cou-pled with the passage of other amend-ments that I offered, including banning imports of large-capacity ammunition magazines, the Federal Gang Violence Act, the James Guelff Body Armor Act, and anti-bombmaking legislation, this bill now represents a great step for-ward in the effort to reduce juvenile and violent crime. I ask that I be added as a co-sponsor of the bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting its passage. EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I sup- port Senator K ERRY 's amendment on early childhood development. The na-tion's highest priority should be to en-sure that all children begin school ready to learn. Our governors realized this a decade ago when they said that the country's number one goal should be to prepare all children to enter VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, May 20, 1999 school ''ready to learn.'' We aren't going to meet our school readiness goals by the year 2000, but we must do all we can to reach this objective soon. We cannot afford to let another decade pass without investing more effectively in young children's educational devel-opment. As we debate how to prevent youth violence, it is gratifying that Senators on both sides of the aisle are recog-nizing the importance of investing in children while they are young. During these early, formative years, construc-tive interventions have the potential to make the greatest impact. Early learning programs\u2014including pre-kin-dergarten, Early Head Start, Head Start, and other activities for young children\u2014are building blocks for suc-cess. Scientific research confirms that in the first few years of life, children develop essential learning and social skills that they will use throughout their lives. Quality early education stimulates young minds, enhances their develop-ment, and encourages their learning. Children who attend high quality pre- school classes have stronger language, math, and social skills than children who attend classes of inferior quality. Low-income children are particularly likely to benefit from quality pro-grams. These early skills translate into greater school readiness. First graders who begin school with strong language and learning skills are more motivated to learn, and they benefit more from classroom instruction. Quality early education programs also have impor-tant long range consequences and are closely associated with increased aca-demic achievement, higher adult earn-ings, and far less involvement with the criminal justice system. Investments in these programs make sense, and they are cost effective as well. Economist Steven Barnett found that the High/Scope Foundations' Perry Preschool Project saved $150,000 per participant in crime costs alone. Even after subtracting the interest that could have been earned by invest-ing the program's funding in financial markets, the project produced a net savings of $7.16\u2014including more than $6 in crime savings\u2014for every dollar in-vested. At risk 3 and 4 years olds in the High/ Scope program were one-fifth as likely, by age 27, to have become chronic lawbreakers, compared to similar chil-dren randomly assigned to a control group. In other words, failure to pro-vide these services multiplied by 5 times the risk that these infants and toddlers would grow up to be delin-quent teenagers and adults. Over 23 million children under 6 live in the United States, and all of these children deserve the opportunity to start school ready to learn. To make this goal a reality, we must make sig-nificant investments in children, long before they ever walk through the schoolhouse door. Our children cannot wait, nor can we. In March, Senator S TEVENS and I in- troduced a bill, S. 749, cosponsored by Senators D ODD, JEFFORDS , and K ERRY , to create an ''Early Learning Trust Fund'' to improve funding for early education programs. This bipartisan bill provides states with $10 billion over 5 years to strengthen and improve early education programs for children under 6. By increasing the number of children who have early learning op-portunities, we will ensure that many more children begin school ready to read. The ''Early Learning Trust Fund'' will provide each state with re-sources to strengthen and improve early education. Governors will receive the grants, and communities, along with parents, will decide how these funds can best be used. Grants will be distributed based on a formula which takes into account the relative number of young children in each state, and the Department of health and Human Services will allo-cate the funds to the states. To assist in this process, governors will appoint a sate council of representatives from the office of the governor, other rel-evant state agencies, Head Start, pa-rental organizations, and resource and referral agencies\u2014all experts in the field of early education. The state councils will be responsible for setting priorities and approving and imple-menting state plans to improve early education. One of the great strengths of the ''Early Learning Trust Fund'' is its flexibility. States will have the flexi-bility to invest in an array of strate-gies that give young children the build-ing blocks to become good readers and good students. Essentially, our pro-posal does four things: (1) it enhances educational services provided by cur-rent child care programs and improves the quality of these programs; (2) it builds on the momentum of states like Georgia and New York, which are ex-panding their pre-kindergarten serv-ices; (3) it expands Head Start to in-clude full-day, full-year services to help children of working parents begin school ready to learn; and (4) it ensures that children with special needs have access to as wide a range of these serv-ices as possible. This legislation will give commu- nities what they have been asking for\u2014 funding for coordinated services to ''fill in the gaps.'' Communities needs this so-called ''glue'' money to strengthen their early education serv-ices, and this approach will give them much needed support. As a result, many more children will benefit and begin school ready to learn, ready to reach their full potential. The nation's future depends on how well today's children are prepared to meet the challenges of tomorrow. If we are serious about improving our chil-dren's lives, I urge my colleagues to support the Early Learning Trust Fund that Senator S TEVENS and I will bring to the floor soon. Mr. REED. Mr. President, in the past week the Republican majority in the Senate finally has begun to show signs of understanding that Americans want reasonable gun control policies in this country. We have made some progress by passing a ban on juvenile possession of semiautomatic assault weapons and a ban on the importation of high-ca-pacity ammunition clips. We saw most Republicans join all Democrats in vot-ing to require that child safety devices be sold with all handguns. And finally, this morning, with a tie-breaking vote by the Vice President, we passed the Lautenberg amendment to firmly close the gun show loophole. These are the kinds of measures that Democrats in Congress have been advo-cating for years, and it is unfortunate that it took a tragedy like Littleton to bring our colleagues in the majority around to our way of thinking, but we welcome even these small steps in the right direction. But small steps they are, Mr. Presi- dent, and we need to do much more. We should reinstate the Brady waiting pe-riod, which expired last November, to provide a cooling off period before the purchase of a handgun. We should pass a child access prevention law to hold adults responsible if they allow a child to gain access to a firearm and that child then uses the firearm to harm an-other person. And we should firmly close the Internet gun sales loophole, something the Senate failed to do last week. I also believe that we should apply the same consumer product regulations which apply to virtually every other industry and product in this country to guns. If toy guns, teddy bears, lawn mowers and hair dryers are subject to regulation to ensure that they include features to minimize the danger to children, why not firearms? I plan to introduce legislation to allow the Con-sumer Product Safety Commission to regulate firearms to protect children and adults against unreasonable risk of injury. I know my friend Senator T ORRICELLI has introduced a bill to allow the Treasury Department to reg-ulate firearms. Whichever agency ulti-mately has oversight, the important thing is that guns should no longer be the only consumer product exempt from basic safety regulations. Mr. President, the NRA's own esti- mate is that there are over 200 million guns in this country. That's nearly one for every American. But let's remem-ber that most Americans don't own guns. For most Americans, especially in urban areas, a gun in a public place in the possession of anyone other than a law enforcement officer usually brings on a sense of fear, not a sense of protection. As the President said a few weeks ago, this fundamental difference in per-spective is at the heart of this gun de-bate. If we are to solve the problem of gun violence in this country, we have to come to a meeting of the minds be-tween gun owners and non-gun owners, between rural and urban America. Americans who live in urban and sub- urban communities need to understand VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5718 May 20, 1999 the legitimate use of firearms for hunt- ing and sports activities. But at the same time, members of Congress from mostly rural states must recognize the immense pain and suffering that guns cause in our nation's urban areas, and they should work with us to convince their constituents that reasonable, tar-geted gun restrictions can make a world of difference by saving lives in America's cities and suburbs. I would also add that this is not sim- ply an eastern vs. western states issue. For example, the Washington Post re-cently reported that in Florida, six of the state's most urban counties have adopted measures to require a waiting period and background checks on all firearm sales at guns shows, while the rest of the state has not. Every sen-ator, from every region of the country, has some constituents who legally use firearms, and others who want nothing to do with them and see them as a deadly threat. My state is no different, and I recognize that many of my con-stituents are decent people who hunt or sport-shoot safely. While much more needs to be done, and while we are still far from passing comprehensive gun safety legislation, we have seen in the past week at least a few limited examples of how, working together, we can bridge the gap and ap-prove reasonable, targeted restrictions on gun access without taking away a law-abiding, adult citizen's ability to own a gun. I also believe that gun dealers should be held responsible if they violate fed-eral law by selling a firearm to a minor, convicted felon, or others pro-hibited from buying firearms. Cur-rently, there are over 104,000 federally licensed firearms dealers in the United States. While most of these dealers are responsible small business people, re-cent tracing of crime-related guns by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) has found substantial evidence that some dealers are selling guns to juveniles and convicted felons. This direct diversion of weapons from retail to illegal markets is taking place both through off-the-book sales by corrupt dealers and through so- called straw purchases, when an ineli-gible buyer has a friend or relative buy a firearm for him or her. To remedy this situation, I have in- troduced legislation, the Gun Dealer Responsibility Act, that would provide a statutory cause of action for victims of gun violence against dealers whose illegal sale of a gun directly contrib-utes to the victim's injury. I believe this legislation will make unscrupulous gun dealers think twice about who they are selling weapons to, particu-larly minors, convicted felons, or any other ineligible buyer, either directly or through straw purchases. Our nation's federal juvenile justice programs establish four core principles that have served as the foundation of federal juvenile justice policy for years. States are required to uphold these principles in order to receive fed-eral grant funds for juvenile justice ac- tivities. These four core principles in-clude: (1) Juveniles may not be within sight or sound of adult inmates in secure fa-cilities. The evidence is overwhelm-ingly clear that youth held in adult prisons are frequently preyed upon by adult inmates. Compared to juveniles in juvenile facilities, they are 8 times more likely to commit suicide, 5 times more likely to be sexually assaulted, and 50% more likely to be attacked by a weapon. (2) States should not confine juve- niles for so-called ''status'' offenses, such as truancy, that would not be punishable if committed by an adult. (3) States should remove juveniles from adult jails and lockups: For the same reasons I just mentioned, juve-niles should not be held in adult jails and lockups, with very narrow excep-tions and even then for very limited pe-riods of time. And, (4) States should address the problem of disproportionate minority confine-ment. This last issue is one I want to talk briefly about today, because it is the area where I believe the bill before us most dramatically changes federal pol-icy and clearly fails to uphold the long-standing principles of our juvenile jus-tice system. Nearly seven out of ten ju-veniles held in secure facilities in this country are members of minority groups. African-American juveniles are twice as likely to be arrested as white youth. There is, without question, a con-tinuing need to address minority over- representation in the juvenile justice system. We should keep the incentives in current law that encourage states to do so. Unfortunately, the bill before us would replace those incentives with language that encourages states to re-duce disproportionate representation of, quote, ''segments of the popu-lation,'' an ambiguous and unlimited phrase that could be interpreted to mean men, urban groups, or virtually any ''segment'' of the population. The effective result is that over-representa-tion of minorities would no longer be the focus of our efforts, and one of the pillars of our federal juvenile justice policy would therefore be undermined. I was disappointed that the Senate yes-terday failed to pass the Wellstone amendment to ensure that states con-tinue to address disproportionate mi-nority confinement issues. We have been making some progress in this area, and we need to continue that ef-fort. Another area where I think we can do much more is in the provision of men-tal health services for young people who come into contact with the juve-nile justice system. My friend and fel-low member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Sen-ator W ELLSTONE , spoke eloquently on this subject earlier this week. As he and I have discussed many times, you cannot have a meaningful discussion about juvenile justice without talking about mental health. The two are inti-mately intertwined. Studies find that the rate of mental disorder is two to three times higher among the juvenile offender population than among youth in the general popu-lation. According to a 1994 Department of Justice study, 73% of juveniles in the juvenile justice system reported mental health problems, and 57% re-ported past treatment for those prob-lems. In addition, over 60% of youth in the juvenile justice system may have substance abuse disorders, compared to 22% in the general population. I have prepared legislation to author- ize the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), in cooperation with the De-partment of Justice, to award grants to state or local juvenile justice agencies to provide mental health services for youth offenders with serious emotional disturbances who have been discharged from the juvenile justice system. I be-lieve it is critical that we help local or-ganizations to do several things to as-sist young offenders: (1) develop a plan of services for each youth offender; (2) provide a network of core or aftercare services for each youth offender, in-cluding mental health and substance abuse treatment, respite care, and fos-ter care; and (3) provide planning and transition services to youth offenders while these youngsters are still incar-cerated or detained. I hope that in the context of this bill or the SAMHSA re-authorization we can find room for this important program. I believe that a community-based network of mental health services will reduce the likelihood that troubled youth will end up back in the juvenile justice system. By combining this in-novative grant program with strong prevention programs to reach out to at-risk youth before they come into contact with the juvenile justice sys-tem in the first place, we can attack the problem of juvenile delinquency from both directions. In closing, let me say that we all rec- ognize that the problem of gun violence among our young people is caused by many factors, some of which we may not fully understand. We need more re-sources for prevention programs to reach at-risk youth before they come into contact with the juvenile justice system in the first place, and we have seen an increased willingness on the other side of aisle to provide those re-sources; we need a greater focus on mentoring and counseling for troubled youth, and we've seen some movement on that front as well; and yes, we need better enforcement of firearms laws and more effective prosecution of gun criminals, and there is no question that we will see more resources pro-vided to make that happen. But anyone who honestly considers the tragic events in Littleton one month ago, and the thirteen children who die every day in this country from gun violence, must concede that one of VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5719 May 20, 1999 the biggest problems of all is that our young people have far too easy and un-limited access to guns. We must do more to keep guns away from kids and criminals by making sure that Brady Law background checks are applied across the board, by reinstating the Brady waiting period, by passing a child access prevention law, by firmly closing the Internet gun sales loophole, by holding dealers responsible for ille-gal sales, and by applying to firearms the same consumer product safety reg-ulations that apply to virtually every other product in this country. Let's do the right thing and pass a ju- venile justice bill that includes every means possible to protect our children and all of our citizens from youth vio-lence. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, prior to being elected to the Senate, I served the people of Ohio for two terms as governor. Before that, I served for 10 years as the mayor of Cleveland. I have also been Lieutenant Governor, a County Commissioner, a County Audi-tor and a State Legislator. I have 33 years of experience at every level of government, which I believe gives me wonderful insight into the re-lationship of the federal government with respect to state and local govern-ment. It is the main reason why, over the length of my service to the people of Ohio, I have developed a passion for the issue of federalism\u2014that is, assigning the appropriate role of the federal gov-ernment in relation to state and local government. That passion remains with me to this day, and I vowed when I got to the Sen-ate that I would work to sort out the appropriate roles of the federal, state and local governments. I have committed myself to find ways in which the federal government can be a better partner with our nation's state and local governments. One of my concerns has been the overreaching nature of the federal gov-ernment into areas I have always felt properly belong under the purview of state and local government. Another of my concerns has been the propensity of the federal government to pre-empt our state and local governments. In many cases, the federal government man-dated responsibilities to state and local governments and forced them to pay for the mandates themselves. In regard to unfunded mandates, I, and a number of other state and local elected officials finally got fed up enough to lobby Congress to do some-thing about it, and in 1995, Congress passed the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. I was pleased to be at the Rose Garden representing our state and local governments at the signing cere-mony by the President. And while we now know the cost of what the federal government is impos-ing on the state and local governments, Congress has still got to do more to re-verse the tide of ''command and con-trol'' policies in areas intrusive which are the proper responsibility of state and local governments. Indeed, as syndicated columnist David Broder pointed out in a January 11, 1995 article, ''the unfunded mandate bill is a worthy effort. But in the end, the real solution lies in sorting out more clearly what responsibilities should be financed and run by each level of government.'' I wholeheartedly agree. It is imperative that we delineate the proper role of government at the fed-eral, state and local level. Our forefathers referred to this dif- ferentiation as federalism, and out-lined this relationship in the 10th Amendment: The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people. The importance of the 10th Amend- ment was inherent to the framers of the Constitution, who sought to pre-serve for the states their ability to pass and uphold laws that were specific to each individual state. In this way, states would keep their sovereignty over what we consider the ''day to day'' running of society, reserving the more comprehensive functions of the nation to the federal government. This was envisioned by James Madi- son, who defined the various roles of government in Federalist Paper #45. He wrote: The powers delegated by the proposed Con- stitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and in-definite. The former will be exercised prin-cipally on external objects, as war, peace, ne-gotiation, and foreign commerce . . . The powers reserved to the several states will ex-tend to all the objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and property of the people and the internal order, improvement and prosperity of the state. In a speech before the Volunteers of the National Archives in 1986 regarding the relationship of the Constitution with America's cities and the evolution of federalism, I raised a concern about the trend in American government that I had witnessed since the 1960's. I said: We have seen the expansion of the federal government into new, non-traditional do-mestic policy areas. We have experienced a tremendous increase in the proclivity of Washington both to pre-empt state and local authority and to mandate actions on state and local governments. The cumulative ef-fect of a series of actions by the Congress, the Executive Branch and the U.S. Supreme Court have caused some legal scholars to ob-serve that while constitutional federalism is alive in scholarly treatises, it has expired as a practical political reality. Mr. President, we have made progress since I spoke those words 13 years ago. Not to the level sought by Madison, but progress just the same. As I men-tioned earlier, Congress has passed the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. We've also passed Safe Drinking Water Act reforms in 1996. In addition, states are making the difference in Medicaid re- form and because of the efforts of state leaders working with Congress, we now have comprehensive welfare reform. Also, just this year, we've seen the passage and signing into law of the ''Ed-Flex'' bill, which gives our states and school districts the freedom to use their federal funds for identified edu-cation priorities and today we passed legislation preventing the federal gov-ernment from recouping the tobacco settlement funds back from the states. But we must still do more. Today, we are voting on juvenile jus- tice legislation that would impose cer-tain new federal laws on what is now and has traditionally been a jurisdic-tion of our state and local govern-ments. I have great respect for the managers of this legislation; they have worked incredibly hard to put together this bill which contains a number of good provisions meant to fight juvenile crime and a smorgasbord of other things that on the surface look very appealing. Unfortunately most of them deal with things that are the proper respon-sibility of state and local government and violate in spirit and in substance my interpretation of the 10th Amend-ment and frankly, the interpretation of Alexander Hamilton. Hamilton, who was the greatest pro- ponent in his day of a strong national government, saw law enforcement as a state and local concern. If Hamilton were alive today, he would be appalled at the use of the police power by fed-eral agencies. And to emphasize Hamilton's view, we need only look at Federalist Paper #17: There is one transcendent advantage be- longing to the province of the state govern-ments, which alone suffices to place the mat-ter in a clear and satisfactory light. I mean the ordinary administration of criminal and civil justice. Crime control is a primary responsi- bility of local and state officials. They are on the front lines and they are best suited to tackle the specific problems in their jurisdictions. Juvenile crime control measures are being enacted and carried out in the various states across the country. And sometimes it does take a tragedy such as the one that occurred in Littleton, Colorado or the shooting this morning in Atlanta to spur states on, but they fully recognize their responsibility to provide for the safety of their citizens. The states understand their role and the need to prevent any further in-crease in juvenile crime. They are re-sponding to that need. Involvement by the federal govern- ment in this matter often duplicates the efforts of our state and local gov-ernments. I'll never forget, in 1996, when I was Governor and I went to a crime control conference in Pennsylvania with then- Majority Leader Bob Dole. He was run-ning for President at the time. The VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5720 May 20, 1999 head of the conference suggested 5 things the federal government should do to reduce juvenile crime. It made sense to me, but when I looked at the recommendations, I realized that in Ohio, we were already doing the things that were recommended. In 1994, we instituted a program called ''RECLAIM Ohio'' which is an innovative approach to juvenile correc-tions. This program stresses local deci-sion-making and the creation of more effective, less costly community-based correction alternatives to state incar-ceration. Under ''RECLAIM Ohio,'' local juve- nile court judges are given the flexi-bility to provide the most appropriate rehabilitation option. Since 1992, the population of juvenile offenders in Ohio's youth correction facilities has dropped 20% as a result of this and other innovative local and state pro-grams. Mr. President, the success we have had in Ohio might never have come about if we had to divert our resources towards a federally mandated program. We have seen results with ''RECLAIM Ohio;'' it is best suited for us. In fact, our ''RECLAIM Ohio'' pro- gram was selected as one of the top ten innovative programs in government by the JFK School of Government at Har-vard University\u2014worthy of replicating elsewhere in the United States. In 1995, Ohio crafted its own com- prehensive juvenile crime bill. This bill imposed mandatory bind-over provi-sions for the most heinous crimes and longer minimum sentences. I believe we should heed the words of Senator F REDTHOMPSON , who gave an eloquent speech about this bill last Wednesday. He said ''Among other things, [this bill] makes it easier to prosecute juveniles in Federal criminal court. We have about 100 to 200 pros-ecutions a year of juveniles in Federal court. It is a minuscule part of our criminal justice system.'' To put that in perspective, Senator T HOMPSON pointed out that in 1998, there were ''58,000 Federal criminal cases filed in-volving 79,000 defendants.'' Think about what Senator T HOMPSON says\u201458,000 total federal criminal cases filed; some 200 prosecutions a year of juveniles in Federal court. Do we hon-estly think that we'll have an extraor-dinarily dramatic increase in juvenile prosecutions under this bill? I have to ask: why on earth are we doing this? He further stated, ''[This bill] would allow juveniles as young as 14 years of age to be tried as an adult for violent crimes and drug offenses\u2014drug of-fenses, again, that are of the street crime category, where we have laws on the books in every State of the Union.'' In a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, the leaders of the National Governors' Association said ''the na-tion's governors are concerned that at-tempts to expand federal criminal law. . .into traditional state functions would have little effect in eliminating crime but could undermine state and local anti-crime efforts.'' Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent that a copy of that letter be print-ed in the R ECORD at the conclusion of my remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See Exhibit 1.) Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, the American Bar Association's Task Force on the Federalization of Crimi-nal Law in its report issued at the end of last year stated that ''more than 40% of the federal criminal provisions enacted since the Civil War have been enacted since 1970.'' As a footnote, the report indicates that more than a quar-ter of the federal criminal provisions were enacted over the sixteen year pe-riod of 1980-1996. Some change in the responsibility is legitimate, based upon the scope of particular offenses. However, many changes have simply evolved from cur-rent state and local laws that the fed-eral government has either co-opted or the Congress has directed federal agen-cies to carry-out. As we continue to assign a greater involvement for the federal govern-ment in law enforcement, the impact on other resources is also strained, pri-marily the federal court system. And for those who understand the traditional role of state and local law enforcement, it becomes increasingly frustrating to see the shift in pros-ecuted crimes. Earlier this month in testimony be- fore the Governmental Affairs Com-mittee, Federal Appeals Court Judge Gilbert S. Merritt said that his Court's docket and the case load of the U.S. Attorney's office for his jurisdiction consists of ''mainly drug and illegal possession of firearms cases and other cases that duplicate state crimes'' and that ''federal prosecution of drug and firearms crime is having a minimal ef-fect on the distribution of drugs and il-legal firearms.'' Most compelling, Judge Merritt said ''our law enforcement efforts would be much more effective if Congress re-pealed most duplicate federal crimes and tried to help local and state street police, detectives, prosecutors and judges do a more effective job.'' Judge Merritt suggested that before we federalize crime enforcement, we should ''concentrate federal criminal law enforcement in only the following core areas: (1) Offenses against the United States itself; (2) Multi-State or international criminal activity that is impossible for a single state or its courts to handle; (3) Crimes that involve a matter of overriding federal interest, such as vio-lation of civil rights by state actors; (4) Widespread corruption at the state and local levels; and (5) Crimes of such magnitude or com- plexity that federal resources are re-quired.'' Mr. President, based on what I can see, this legislation does not meet these criteria. So, if we are truly concerned about lowering the incidences of violent crime in America, I believe our focus should be not only on the symptoms of juvenile crime, but on the root causes as well. We have to act first, and not react later, if we wish to benefit our kids. To be sure, there are just plain, bad juveniles who need to be locked up. And, we need better information about juvenile offenders, profiles that will help our courts deal with rough kids and get them off the streets. But, I think part of the problem is youngsters aren't getting the moral and family and religious training at home, responsibilities that are falling more and more on our schools. In Ohio, we established a mediation and dispute resolution program in our kindergartens and first grades to get kids to talk out their problems so they don't resort to violence. We did this because I am concerned, Mr. President, about how we can reach our kids, to help make them become decent, productive members of society. What we need to do is draw a line in the sand, and proclaim that we are not going to allow another generation of children to fall by the wayside. We have to say ''This is where it stops.'' We need to become a better partner with state and local government and invest in our children at the most crit-ical juncture of their lives\u2014pre-natal to three\u2014the time when parents and young children are forming life-long attachments and when parents and other care-givers have an opportunity to construct lasting values. I believe putting our efforts towards creating this powerful, enduring im-pact on a young child's physical, intel-lectual, emotional and social develop-ment will do more to end the cycle of crime and violence in America than anything else the Senate could do. Mr. President, once more, I would like to congratulate the managers of this bill for the time and energy that they have put into this bill, but juve-nile crime control is not the responsi-bility of the federal government. Again, we need only look as far as the Constitution to determine which crimes fall within the purview of the federal government\u2014 1. Article 1, Section 8\u2014To provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States; 2. Article 1, Section 8\u2014To define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, and offenses against the law of nations; and 3. Article 3, Section 3\u2014To declare the punishment for treason. For the remainder of crime that im- pacts our nation, the 10th Amendment spells out quite clearly how we should deal with it: The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are re-served to the states respectively, or to the people. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5721 May 20, 1999 Mr. President, we should follow the wisdom of our forefathers. EXHIBIT 1 NATIONAL GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION , Washington, DC, May 14, 1999. Hon. O RRIN G. H ATCH , Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. P ATRICK J. L EAHY , Ranking Minority Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. DEARMR. CHAIRMAN AND SENATOR LEAHY : As the Senate considers juvenile crime legis-lation, the nation's Governors believe that the federal government should improve its support of states in combating youth vio-lence. This endeavor requires the develop-ment and implementation of programs and policies that strive to prevent delinquency, eliminate the presence of violence wherever children congregate, and ensure strong pun-ishment for those responsible for exposing young people to delinquency, drugs, and vio-lence. The first line of defense against youth violence is responsible parenting. Having recognized this fact, the states' priority in this area should be to establish comprehen-sive services and programs that prevent youth from committing crime. Prevention programs that build self-esteem through achievement of worthwhile goals and offer an alternative to violent and criminal activ-ity are critical to the successful reduction of juvenile crime. There should be a safe environment for children to grow and develop. This includes schools, parks, playgrounds, and any place youth congregate. The rise in handgun vio-lence especially in and around schools is of concern to Governors. There should be swift and certain punishment for individuals who illegally provide a firearm to a minor, or knowingly provide a firearm to a minor for illegal use. Furthermore, there must be im-mediate seizure of guns illegally possessed by minors. Also, there should be strict pen-alties for children below the age of eighteen who illegally possess a firearm. S. 254, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Of- fender Accountability and Rehabilitation Act of 1999 will be among the legislative ini-tiatives considered regarding juvenile crime. We would like to address some of the provi-sions in this legislation. Federalization: The nation's Governors are concerned that attempts to expand federal criminal law (Title I of S. 254) into tradi-tional state functions would have little ef-fect in eliminating crime but could under-mine state and local anticrime efforts. Fur-ther, the Governors are concerned that fed-eral concurrent jurisdiction in criminal jus-tice efforts can be used by the federal gov-ernment as a means to impose undue man-dates on state and local crime control and law enforcement officials. Another federalism issue is raised by sec- tion 1802 the ''Juvenile Criminal History Grants.'' It needs language clarifying what information will be contained in the na-tional data bases, who will have access to the data, how the data will be used, and to affirm states' right to ultimately control ac-cess to their own data under our federal sys-tem. Waiver: The formula in the accountability block grant of S. 254 (Part R\u2014Juvenile Ac-countability Block Grants, Subtitle B) re-quires states to pass-through money to local units of governments handling juvenile jus-tice functions. In many states, including Utah and Vermont, the juvenile crime func-tion is administered at the state level of gov-ernment, working with the locals. S. 254 would allow the Attorney General to waive the pass-through requirement for these states. We support this provision. Flexibility: The current language in S. 254 offers some discretion to Governors over ap-pointments to state advisory boards over-seeing implementation of state programs under the Juvenile Justice Act. Governors should have sole discretion over creation, make-up and appointments to state advisory boards. Some states have existing boards that can fulfill this requirement. Further-more, states should be given maximum flexi-bility to implement the spirit and purposes of the statute for the goals of delinquency prevention, intervention, and protection of juveniles from harm. Also, S. 254 eases the monitoring requirements for state imple-mentation of the Juvenile Justice program. Program participation with core require- ments: Governors believe that rules, regula-tions, definitions, responsibilities, and re-porting requirements authorized in the legis-lation should be reasonable and not impede states' ability to effectively administer the programs promoted in the legislation. Fur-ther, the statute should be designed to en-courage full participation in the program by all the states, but not penalize states that choose not to participate in some or all pro-grams. The recent tragic events in Colorado, Or- egon, Arkansas, Kentucky, and Mississippi and other areas of the country have focused the nation's attention on the need for juve-nile justice reform. We appreciate your tak-ing our concerns under consideration as you debate S. 254. Sincerely, G OVERNOR THOMAS R. CARPER , Chairman. GOVERNOR MICHAEL O. LEAVITT , Vice Chairman. GOVERNOR JAMES B. H UNT, JR., Chairman, Human Re- sources Committee. GOVERNOR MIKEHUCKABEE , Vice Chairman, Human Resources Committee. Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to S. 254, the Juve-nile Justice Bill. I oppose this bill be-cause it does far more harm than good to the fundamental interests of our na-tion's children. The bill fails to do what the Little- ton tragedy screams out loudly and clearly we should do: strive to prevent future schoolhouse tragedies and all ju-venile violence. The bill is long on prosecution and detention but short on prevention. During debate on this bill, I was glad to see that some of my concerns were resolved. After a contentious debate, the Senate finally closed the gun show loophole. The Lautenberg-Kerrey amendment is a sensible regulation on the sale of guns at gun shows. It does not prevent law-abiding citizens from selling and buying guns at gun shows. The Senate's debate on guns in the last week had what I believe to be a sensible outcome. But I do want to point out one thing about the debate we have had on various amendments to this bill dealing with the topic of gun control. Obviously, there are very strong feelings about gun-related amendments on both sides, and the issues are complex. But the vast major-ity of campaign contributions from groups interested in these amendments to the Senators who are voting on them is coming from one side. Accord-ing to the Center for Responsive Poli-tics, gun rights groups, including the National Rifle Association, gave over $9 million to candidates, PACs, and parties from 1991 to 1998. The NRA gave $1.6 million in PAC contributions to federal candidates last year. Handgun Control, Inc. gave a total of $146,000. With respect to Senator L AUTEN - BERG 's amendment to close the gun show loophole last week, the Center found that those who voted against that amendment had received an aver-age of over $10,478 from gun rights groups, while those who voted for it averaged only $297. I say this not to cast aspersions on any Senator's vote, but because I think the public record of our debate on these issues would be in-complete without this information. There have been other improvements made in the bill as a result of the de-bate here on the floor and negotiations among Senators and the Managers. The final bill now reasonably protects the privacy of juvenile offender records. The amendment to ensure the separa-tion of children from adult prisoners in mixed prison settings also was adopted. This good work, however, is not enough to undo the harm that this bill will do to our nation's children. We have strong evidence that preven- tion reduces crime. According to the Children's Defense Fund, in the first year after the Baltimore Police De-partment opened an after-school pro-gram in a high-crime area, crime in that neighborhood dropped 42%. Cin-cinnati's crime rate dropped 24% since it instituted violence prevention, edu-cation, social and recreation programs. And in Fort Worth, Texas, gang-related crime dropped by 26% as a result of a gang reduction program. Now, the Hatch-Biden amendment takes us part of the way there by al-lowing 25% of funding for juvenile block grants to be allocated to preven-tion efforts. But frankly, that's not enough. We need to do more. Our chil-dren's future demands that we do more. The Juvenile Justice bill emphasizes detention and intervention after juve-niles have already gotten into trouble. The bill, however, does not provide sen-sible, adequate funding for prevention programs. Programs that will help to ensure that kids will not turn to crime and violence and will never have to ex-perience handcuffs slapped on their wrists or the inside of a detention cen-ter. This bill also deeply troubles me be- cause it will put a halt to efforts to re-duce discrimination in our juvenile jus-tice system. The bill ignores reality: we are throwing African-American kids into jails at a higher rate than white kids who commit the exact same of-fense. This phenomenon is called dis-proportionate minority confinement. Our Nation has come a long way to- ward achieving racial harmony and VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5722 May 20, 1999 equality, but we still have a long way to go. In nearly every state, children of minority racial and ethnic back-grounds are over-represented at every stage of the juvenile justice system and receive harsher treatment by the sys-tem. A California study has shown that black youths consistently receive harsher punishment and are more like-ly to receive jail time than white youths convicted of the same offenses. Current law requires states to identify disproportionate minority confinement in their states, to analyze why it exists and to develop strategies to address the causes of disproportionate minority confinement. The law does not require and has never resulted in the release of juveniles. Nor does the law provide for quotas. And no state's funding under the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act has ever been reduced as a result of non-compliance. In fact, the current law has been very effective. Forty states are imple- menting or developing intervention plans to address disproportionate mi-nority confinement. This bill will bring to a halt this good work conducted by the states. These states have just begun to address the disturbing reality of disproportionate minority confine-ment. But under this Juvenile Justice bill, the law enforcement community will no longer be required to address the problem of discriminatory treat-ment of minority juvenile offenders. This is outrageous. I am outraged, and this body should be outraged, that we are punishing black kids more harshly than white kids for the exact same offenses. The debate on this issue illustrated how much more work we still need to do on civil rights. Many of my colleagues would have you believe that there is no longer a race problem in this country. I beg to differ. To those colleagues, I ask you to look around this chamber and identify for me the Senator of Afri-can descent. You cannot because there is not one. I am troubled that on this and other important civil rights issues, we do not have a member of the Afri-can-American community as one of our colleagues. I cannot help but think that our debate would have been better informed if we had the voice of an Afri-can-American Senator speaking at one of our podiums. I cannot help but think that the vote on the Wellstone-Ken-nedy amendment would have had a dif-ferent outcome if we had the vote of an African-American Senator cast on this floor. We have come a long way toward rid- ding our nation of discrimination against African Americans and other minorities. But we need to keep forging ahead for the good of our children and the future of our country. Let us not turn back the clock. The bill also does more harm than good by shifting the burden to the child to show why he or she should be tried in a juvenile court, not as an adult. Under current law, federal judges, not prosecutors, decide whether a child will be tried as an adult after a full hearing. If the prosecutor believes that a child should be charged as an adult, the prosecutor goes to court and puts on evidence to establish why the child should be tried as an adult. This is called a ''waiver'' hearing. The pros-ecutor must show reason for the judge to waive the child into adult court. Now, under the Juvenile Justice bill, the prosecutor would be able to charge children as young as 14 as adults if they have allegedly committed a fel-ony. The child\u2014not the prosecutor\u2014 would request a hearing to prove to the judge that he or should be treated as a child. There is great wisdom in the current law. The decision to prosecute a child as an adult is a serious one that will profoundly impact that child's life and the sentence that will follow convic-tion. It is better to leave that decision to an impartial judge, not the pros-ecutor. Finally, I must cast my vote against this bill because it creates yet another federal death penalty. The Senate un-fortunately passed the Hatch-Feinstein amendment, which will allow imposi-tion of the death penalty against per-sons who cause the death of another person during an act of animal enter-prise terrorism. I have been, and con-tinue to be, a strong, steadfast oppo-nent of the death penalty. In my view, the death penalty is unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punish-ment. And it is morally wrong for a civilized society to continue to impose this penalty. We should lock up offend-ers for life, but we should not take their lives. In sum, Mr. President, I urge my col- leagues to heed the advice of skilled professionals who work with our youth every day. Organizations like the Chil-dren's Defense Fund, the Youth Law Center, the National Network for Youth have expressed their serious op-position to the bill. These organiza-tions represent the thousands of people who are conducting effective after- school programs, providing counseling to troubled youth and other necessary services to our children at risk. In other words, these organizations are the experts. The experts believe that, although the bill is much improved over last year's juvenile justice bill and corrects some problems in the original bill as it came to the floor last week, the final bill is still a regressive solution to juvenile crime. Let us put aside our partisanship for the sake of our children's and our Na-tion's future. I must oppose this juve-nile justice bill. I yield the floor. Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, Senate bill 254 does not, in my opinion, war-rant passage. I will vote against the bill because it is fundamentally fraudu-lent. First, it wrongly assumes that Washington, DC has the answers to ju-venile crime and the right to impose its will over that of state and local communities. Second, it is fraudulent because it promises billions of dollars for new programs that will not be im-plemented because the money is simply not available. To hold out the false hope that the federal government can, through the passage of yet another law, offer an easy solution detracts from the impor-tant, and admittedly difficult, work that must continue in our homes, schools and communities. As difficult as it may be for many of my colleagues to accept, the cure for the violence and disrespect for life that is prevalent in our society, particularly in our younger generations, will not be found in this body by passing another federal law. I wish it were that easy. The cure will be found after a great deal of soul-searching by our nation at all levels. Parents must re-engage in their children's lives. Schools must work harder to spot the warning signs displayed by our troubled youth and take action before tragedy occurs. And those who market gratuitous vio-lence\u2014whether it be through tele-vision, movies, video games or the Internet\u2014must consider the responsi-bility they have to society, as well as to their bottom line. Most decisions should be made in our communities, not in the Congress. States should be allowed to experiment with a wide range of programs, not told what to do by Washington D.C. I recognize some positive elements in this bill. The relaxation, for example, of the strict sight and sound separation requirements between juvenile and adult prisoners is a common sense change consistent with the views ex-pressed by law enforcement officials in my state. Although I support the Ashcroft Amendment that gives local educators the flexibility to treat equal-ly all students who bring guns to schools, the law it amends is fun-damentally flawed and requires more thorough debate. I intend to have this debate later this year. The positive elements in S. 254, how- ever, are outweighed by the negative: the bill usurps state, local, and private sector authority, both in spirit and in practice. For example, although S. 254 makes federal juvenile adjudication and conviction records available to schools in certain circumstances, thus permitting school officials knowledge of the conceivable monstrous acts of a prospective student, it then prohibits all schools, once privy to that informa-tion, from using it in admissions deci-sions. The bill makes promises we cannot keep and creates expectations we can-not meet. S. 254 authorizes prodigious amounts of federal funds for numerous pro-grams, and the promise of these monies has led to considerable fighting over their allocation, particularly over ear-marking funds for crime prevention programs. While the debate between prevention and punishment is an im-portant one, it is, unfortunately, also VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, SENATE S5723 May 20, 1999 hollow in this case: it is extremely un- likely that many of the programs au-thorized in S. 254 will be funded at any-where near the levels authorized, if at all. Much to my dismay and those of other appropriators, it is unclear whether we will be able this year to meet current commitments to juvenile justice and law enforcement. In the budget he sent to Congress, the Presi-dent eliminated numerous federal grant programs and gutted others. The Byrne Grants that have been put to such good use in Washington state to, among other things establish multi-ju-risdictional drug task forces, were re-duced by more than 20% in the Presi-dent's budget. Local law enforcement block grants, for which $523 million was appropriated in 1999, and which are used for a range of law enforcement needs, from putting more officers on the streets to improving law enforce-ment communications systems, were eliminated entirely. Grants to states for prison construction, a $720 million program in 1999, was reduced to $75 million in the President's FY2000 budg-et. Put another way: our first priority ought to be funding our current crime prevention programs, rather than add-ing a passel of new ones we frankly cannot afford. Regrettably, many of the philo- sophical and practical concerns I have with this legislation simply were not addressed during the many long days it has been on the floor because we have spent so much time debating gun amendments. I firmly believe in com-mon sense gun safety procedures as long as they do not infringe on the Sec-ond Amendment freedoms of law abid-ing adults. Several times this week I voted for amendments that would help to promote gun safety or keep guns out of the hands of criminals, and just as often I voted against amendments that infringed on second amendment rights that would not effectively do this. Never, however, did I vote on an amendment that I thought would have prevented the recent tragedies in Geor-gia and Colorado. And so, with regret, I cannot join my colleagues in misleading the American people in promising that through this, or any other, bill, we will make their communities and schools safe again. Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am pleased that my amendment to the pending Juvenile Justice bill was in-cluded in a package of amendments cleared by the managers. I would like to talk briefly about why this provi-sion is crucial to combatting school vi-olence. As I am sure many of my colleagues are aware, the Holland Woods Middle School in Port Huron, Michigan, made national news this past week. Four children, the youngest of them 12 years old, were arrested for plotting to do ''something worse'' than the tragedy that occurred in Littleton, Colorado. Police in Port Huron believe that the plot was more than a prank. They be-lieve the students planned to rob a gun store for the weapons needed to carry out their plan. Here we have yet another sign, Mr. President, of the epidemic in this coun-try of violence and fear in our schools. All across the country, schools are experiencing bomb threats and stu-dents and teachers are beginning to fear entering the classroom. The De-troit News front page headline from yesterday summed it up: ''Fear, threats invade Metro classrooms.'' The News went on to report that one-third of the 560 students at Holland Woods Middle School stayed home Monday, the first day of classes since police dis-covered the plot to massacre students there. Mr. President, students should not fear for their lives when they enter the school building. Indeed, they have a right not to be put in this kind of fear, particularly on school grounds. I believe we must do more to help schools deal with threats of violence. We must give schools more options to prevent the type of tragedy that oc-curred in Littleton and that also might have occurred in Port Huron. Following the incident in Holland Woods Middle School, Assistant Super-intendent Thomas Miller outlined the school system's response to increasing security at their schools. The school system's plan would include 24-hour se-curity guard surveillance at all schools and a bomb-sniffing dog. Other pro-posed security measures could include metal detectors, the elimination of coats in classrooms and photo identi-fication badges for pupils and teachers. Mr. President, my provision would allow schools facing these serious secu-rity problems to access Safe and Drug Free School money to address their se-curity needs and to truly keep their schools ''safe.'' In light of the growing number of vi- olence in our schools and an increase in the number of threats, we must provide local school districts with further, ef-fective options in combatting the pro-liferation of guns, explosives, and other weapons in our schools. My provision will also help schools deal with the scourge of drugs, a scourge which not only ruins indi-vidual lives but also breeds the kinds of isolation, maladjustment and violence we have seen so often in recent years. Currently, school districts may use funds allocated under the Safe and Drug Free Schools Act for a variety of programs aimed at reducing drug use and school violence. School districts need additional options. My amend-ment would allow local school districts to access funding under the Safe and Drug Free Schools Act for use in con-ducting locker searches for guns, explo-sives, other weapons, or drugs and for the drug testing of students. Drug use constitutes a full-fledged epidemic in our schools, Mr. President. In a recent Luntz survey, three fourths of high school students said that their schools are not drug free. 41 percent re-ported seeing drugs sold on school grounds. And now the drug menace is moving into our middle schools. 46 per-cent, almost half of our middle school kids, go to schools that are not drug free. With the explosion in drug use we also have seen a massive proliferation of guns in our schools. The Depart-ments of Education and Justice report that 6,093 students were expelled for bringing guns to school during the 1996-97 school year alone. This is the situation supposedly ad- dressed by the Safe and Drug Free Schools Act. So, what is this act, writ-ten into law in 1986 and with current funding levels at $566 million, accom-plishing? Tragically little, Mr. Presi-dent. Congress passed the Safe and Drug Free School Act allocating funds to fight drug use and the violence it breeds. But that money is not being spent wisely, on programs that actu-ally succeed in reducing drug use and gun violence in our schools. Instead, Mr. President, a report in the Los Angeles Times has found that grant money is being used to pay for questionable activities like motiva-tional speakers, puppet shows, tickets to Disneyland, dunking booths and magic shows. Surely we can use this law for something more than what President Clinton's own drug Czar, General Barry McCaffrey, calls a pro-gram to ''mail out checks.'' Our children and their teachers de- serve better. Indeed, Mr. President, they are demanding better. For three years running, teens in the Luntz sur-vey have deemed drugs the most impor-tant problem they face. Most teens favor random locker searches and drug testing of all students. And their teachers agree. Four out of five teachers favor locker searches and a zero tolerance policy on drugs. Two thirds favor at least some form of drug testing. Mr. President, our teachers and our children have recognized the obvious: we must find those who are bringing guns and explosives into our schools if we are to stop gun and other forms of violence affecting our kids By the same token, Mr. President, you must find those who are using and dealing drugs before you can effec-tively deal with the drug problem in our schools. My amendment accepts the common sense logic expressed by our teachers and students. My amendment does nothing to alter the availability of funds for other op-tions in the fight against drugs and gun violence in our schools. It merely adds to the list the option of using these funds for locker searches and drug test-ing. It, rightly in my view, leaves the final decision on these issues to those who know the needs of their schools best\u2014local authorities. But it adds an important option to the list from which they can choose. I am pleased that this common sense proposal has been cleared by the man-agers. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov \u2014 SENATE S5724 May 20, 1999 I yield the floor. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, with the passage of the Juvenile Justice bill today the Senate took a positive step forward in addressing the youth vio-lence that we have sadly seen far too much of in recent weeks. One month ago today, we watched in horror as children turned violent against other children, and we asked ourselves why? Today, again, we've seen the horror of a high school stu-dent firing a weapon at his school-mates. There is no one cause of this youth violence, the causes are many but the common denominator in all of these school shootings cannot be ig-nored or denied: the easy access our young people have to guns. If there is one silver lining in what happened at Littleton it's that this event has become a catalyst for the Senate to finally begin to overcome the disproportionate influence of the gun lobby and to close a few of the gap-ing loopholes in our federal gun laws which give our youth such easy access to guns. Over the last few weeks, with the Ju- venile Justice bill on the floor of the Senate, we have taken important steps to strengthen our current laws. We have passed legislation to prohibit ju-veniles from owning semiautomatic weapons and large capacity ammuni-tion devices. We have banned the im-portation of big ammunition clips, which have been flooding into the United States by the millions. The Senate passed an amendment requiring that handguns be sold with trigger locking devices to protect children. And just this morning, the Senate, by one vote, the deciding vote cast by Vice President G ORE, passed legislation to regulate the sale of firearms at guns shows, ensuring juveniles and others cannot use these shows as a convenient way to circumvent the safeguards ap-plied to normal sales through licensed gun dealers. Mr. President, I believe it's clear that the American people support the actions we have taken. In fact, I am hopeful that we will build on these first steps, for example, to ban semiauto-matic assault weapons and handguns for persons under 21 years of age. This may be one of our most important tasks yet. According the Bureau of Al-cohol, Tobacco and Firearms' Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative, the two most frequent ages at which crimes are committed with gun posses-sion are 18 and 19. In 1997, 22% of those arrested for murder were 18, 19 or 20 years old. This legislation clearly falls short of closing all of the loopholes which allow our youth easy access to deadly weap-ons. However, in the wake of the trag-edy at Littleton, the Senate has taken critical steps forward. This is a victory for the good sense of the American peo-ple over the entrenched interests of NRA lobbyists in Washington. Mr. President, in addition to pre- venting our youth from having access to deadly weapons, we must also ensure that schools have access to proven vio-lence prevention programs designed to meet the particular needs of the stu-dents. The bill provides $250 million in grants for projects that allow schools to partner with the U.S. Department of Justice and police officers in crime pre-vention; $113 million for creative on- site school violence prevention pro-grams and alcohol nd drug counseling; and amends the Elementary and Sec-ondary Education Act to make funds available for training in school safety and violence prevention, crisis pre-paredness, mentoring and anti-violence programs. Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the pas- sage of this Juvenile Justice Bill rep-resents an important step forward for those of us who have expressed concern for the safety and well-being of Amer-ica's young people. I am pleased that in spite of the tensions and the controver-sies that have marked these past weeks in the United States Senate, we are, in the final analysis, able to come to-gether as a Senate in support of certain principles that we know are absolutely essential if we are to reform our na-tion's juvenile justice policy to reflect modern life and the needs of all our children in this nation. The aftermath of the tragic school shootings in Littleton and even the vi-olence today in Atlanta underscored for all of us the importance of getting serious about juvenile justice. In this debate here in the Senate about juve-nile justice, we heard a great deal about efforts to keep guns out of the hands of violent students, we heard about efforts to try juvenile offenders as adults, about stiffer sentences, about so many answers to the problem of kids who have run out of second and third chances\u2014kids who are violent, kids who are committing crimes, chil-dren who are a danger to themselves and a danger to those around him. I was a prosecutor in Massachusetts be-fore I entered elected office. I have seen these violent teenagers and young people come to court, and let me tell you, there is nothing more tragic than seeing these children who\u2014in too many cases \u2014have a jail cell in their future not far down the road, children who have done what is, at times, irrep-arable harm to their communities. I am pleased we are passing a bill today which demonstrates we don't only begin to care about these kids at that point \u2014after the violence, after the arrest, after the damage has been done, when it may be too late\u2014when we could have started intervening in our kids' lives early on, before it was too late. We can say that we have had a real debate about juvenile justice be-cause we are passing a bill that makes some critical investments in vital early childhood development efforts, but a great deal of work remains un-done. The truth is that early intervention can have a powerful effect on reducing government welfare, health, criminal justice, and education expenditures in the long run. By taking steps now we can reduce later destructive behavior such as dropping out of school, drug use, and criminal acts like the ones we have seen in Littleton and Jonesboro. We are doing that in this bill\u2014but we should be doing far more. A study of the High/Scope Founda- tion's Perry Preschool found that at- risk toddlers who received pre-school-ing and a weekly home visit reduced the risk that these children would grow up to become chronic law breakers by a startling 80 percent. The Syracuse Uni-versity Family Development Study showed that providing quality early- childhood programs to families until children reached age five reduces the children's risk of delinquency 10 years later by 90 percent. It is no wonder that a recent survey of police chiefs found that nine out of ten said that ''America could sharply reduce crime if govern-ment invested more'' in these early intervention programs. I know it can work. I visited an in- credible center, the Castle Square Early Childhood Development Center in Boston, and I saw kids getting the attention they need during the day while their parents work, children being held and read to, and cared for, children who aren't raising themselves, parents who come in and volunteer in the evening and take classes there so they can better take care of their kids when they're sick or when they need special attention. But you know what, for the sixty kids in that program, there are six hundred on a waiting list. There is the Early Childhood Initia- tive in Allegheny County, PA\u2014one of the first pilot programs in this country which gave life to the kind of legisla-tion we're passing here today\u2014an inno-vative program which helps low-in-come children from birth to age five become successful, productive adults by enrolling them in high quality, neighborhood-based early care and edu-cation programs ranging from Head Start, center-based child care, home- based child care, and school readiness programs. ECI draws on everything that's right about Allegheny County\u2014 the strengths of its communities\u2014 neighborhood decision-making, parent involvement, and quality measure-ment. Parents and community groups decide if they want to participate and they come together and develop a pro-posal tailored for the community. Reg-ular review programs ensure quality programming and cost-effectiveness. We're talking about local control get-ting results locally: 19,000 pre-school aged children from low-income fami-lies, 10,000 of which were not enrolled in any child care or education program. By the year 2000, through funding sup-plied by ECI, approximately 75% of these under-served pre-schoolers will be reached. Early evaluations show that enrolled children are achieving at rates equivalent to their middle in-come peers. And as we know, without this leveling of the playing field, low- VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5725 May 20, 1999 income children are at a greater risk of encountering the juvenile justice sys-tem. That's a real difference. These kinds of programs are success- ful because children's experiences dur-ing their early years of life lay the foundation for their future develop-ment. But in too many places in this country our failure to provide young children what they need during these crucial early years has long-term con-sequences and costs for America. Recent Scientific evidence conclu- sively demonstrates that enhancing children's physical, social, emotional, and intellectual development will re-sult in tremendous benefits for chil-dren, families, and our nation. The electrical activity of brain cells actu-ally changes the physical structure of the brain itself. Without a stimulating environment, the baby's brain suffers. At birth, a baby's brain contains 100 billion neurons, roughly as many nerve cells as there are stars in the Milky Way. But the wiring pattern between these neurons develops over time. Chil-dren who play very little or are rarely touched develop brains 20 to 30 percent smaller than normal for their age. Reversing these problems later in life is far more difficult and costly. We know that\u2014if it wasn't so much hard-er, we wouldn't be having this difficult debate in the Senate. I think it is time we talked about giving our kids the right start in their lives they need to be healthy, to be successful, to mature in a way that doesn't lead to at-risk and disruptive behavior and violence down the road. We should stop and consider what is really at stake here. Poverty seriously impairs young children's language de-velopment, math skills, IQ scores, and their later school completion. Poor young children also are at heightened risk of infant mortality, anemia, and stunted growth. Of the 12 million chil-dren under the age of 3 in the United States today, 3 million\u201425 percent\u2014 live in poverty. Three out of five moth-ers with children under three work, but one study found that 40 percent of the facilities at child care centers serving infants provided care of such poor qual-ity as to actually jeopardize children's health, safety, or development. In more than half of the states, one out of every four children between 19 months and three years of age is not fully immu-nized against common childhood dis-eases. Children who are not immunized are more likely to contract prevent-able diseases, which can cause long- term harm. Children younger than three make up 27 percent of the one million children who are determined to be abused or neglected each year. Of the 1,200 children who died from abuse and neglect in 1995, 85 percent were younger than five and 45 percent were younger than one. Unfortunately, our Government ex- penditure patterns have been inverse to the most important early development period for human beings. Although we know that early investment can dra-matically reduce later remedial and so- cial costs, our nation has spent no more than $35 billion over five years on federal programs for at-risk or delin-quent youth and child welfare pro-grams. That is a course we are taking some steps to change today. We are starting to talk in a serious and a thoughtful way\u2014through a bipartisan approach\u2014 about making a difference in the lives of our children before they're put at risk. We are starting to accept the truth that we can do a lot more to help our kids grow up healthy with prom-ising futures in an early childhood de-velopment center, in a classroom, and in a doctor's office than we can in a courtroom or in a jail cell. But we could be doing much more. These issues are now a part of this juvenile justice debate. But they need to be a bigger part of every debate we have about our kids' future. My col-league K ITBOND and I reintroduced yesterday our Early Childhood Devel-opment Act which we had previously introduced in the last Congress, and which had passed as part of the tobacco legislation last summer. That bill moves us forward in a bipartisan way towards a different kind of discussion about juvenile justice\u2014and towards ac-tions we can take to provide meaning-ful intervention in the lives of all of our children. I am appreciative of the deep support we've found for our ap-proach in this legislation by Senator S TEVENS , Senator J EFFORDS , Senator DODD, Senator K ENNEDY and all of the cosponsors of the original Kerry Bond bill: Senator H OLLINGS , Senator J OHN- SON, Senator ANDRIEU EVIN, Senator M OYNIHAN , Senator WELLSTONE , and my colleague from New Jersey, Senator B OBTORRICELLI . I am pleased to join Senators S TEVENS and K ENNEDY in supporting parenting, but as we expressed in our sense-of-the- Senate amendment there is much more we need to be doing in terms of broader early childhood development efforts\u2014 we need a more comprehensive ap-proach. In this legislation we have taken an important step towards recognizing the importance of early childhood develop-ment programs for our children, as well as the responsibility of the Congress to make early childhood investments a priority in our budget process.

Without objection, it is so or- dered. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in the past, time seemed to roll past school shootings and similar tragedies. The public was quickly distracted. Yet, Littleton was different. The need to do something about the serious problem of youth violence has always been appar-ent. The tragedy of a month ago gave us the ingenuity and dedication to fol-low through. I have said since the outset of this debate that this issue is a complex problem and one which requires dedica-tion and a spirit of cooperation. I felt that we needed to examine this and other acts of school violence and not single-out one politically attractive in-terest as a cause. In doing what's right for our children and in doing what's right for the public at large, our per-sonal interests had to take a back seat. While I believe the cooperative spirit was lacking on occasion, I believe that the Senate has crafted a consensus product and one which I intend to sup-port. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov \u2014 SENATE S5726 May 20, 1999 At the start of this debate, I along with several of my colleagues an-nounced a comprehensive plan to re-spond to the problem of violent juve-nile crime. Our Youth Violence Plan contains four main components: 1. Prevention and Enforcement As- sistance to State and Local Govern-ment; 2. Parental Empowerment and Stem- ming the Influence of Cultural Vio-lence; 3. Getting Tough on Violent Juve- niles and Those Who Commit Violent Crimes with a Firearm; and 4. Providing for Safe and Secure Schools. Each element of this plan\u2014all of it\u2014 is included in S. 254 as amended. I. Prevention & Enforcement Assist- ance to State and Local Government: The first tier of this plan involved pas-sage of the underlying bill\u2014S. 254, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender and Accountability Act. We have pro-vided a targeted infusion of funds to State and local authorities to combat juvenile crime. S. 254 provides over $1 billion a year to the States to fight ju-venile crime and prevent juvenile de-linquency. We need to reach out to young children early in life, insure that parents are empowered to do what they believe is best for their children, and take meaningful steps to give local education and enforcement officials the tools they need to hold violent ju-veniles accountable. S. 254 accom-plishes this goal. II. Parental Empowerment and Stem- ming the Influence of Cultural Vio-lence: The second tier of our plan in-volved Congress taking steps to em-power parents, educators and the en-tertainment industry to do more to limit the exposure of America's chil-dren to violence in our popular culture. We offered several amendments to the underlying bill which furthered this leg of our plan and all of them passed the Senate. For example, this bill gives parents the power to screen undesir-able material from entering their homes over the Internet. We have given the entertainment industry the tools it needs to develop and enforce pre-exist-ing ratings systems so that children are not exposed to material that the industry itself has deemed unsuitable for children. And we have established a National Commission on Youth Vio-lence. It is time for us to hold Holly-wood\u2014and the rest of the entertain-ment industry\u2014a bit more account-able. III. Getting Tough on Violent Juve- niles and Enforce Existing Law: A third tier of our plan insured that vio-lent juveniles\u2014teenagers who commit violent crimes\u2014will be held account-able. Part of the solution is to insure that when a teenager brings a gun to school, he or she is held accountable by school authorities and the criminal justice system. We take care of this in the bill. We also extend the Youth Handgun Safety Act to semi-automatic assault rifles. The bill before the Sen-ate contains reforms like the juvenile Brady provision\u2014a measure which will prohibit firearms possession by violent juvenile offenders. We increase pen-alties for transferring a gun to a minor and other corrupting acts. Most importantly, we respond to the biggest of gun law loopholes\u2014the Clin-ton Administration's failure to enforce the gun laws already on the books. We insure that the Department of Justice will fulfill its obligation to enforce the law. Prosecuting violent gun offenders will be made a priority for this Admin-istration whether they like it or not. IV. Safe and Secure Schools: The fourth element of our plan revolves around the basic right that all students share\u2014the right to receive the quality education they deserve. Our teachers and students need to know that their school is safe and that, should they take action to deal with a violent stu-dent, the teacher will be protected. Our bill promotes safe and secure schools, free of undue disruption and violence, so that our teachers can teach and our children can learn. We provide greater flexibility to local communities in how they use federal education funds. We also provide teachers with limited civil liability protection should they take action to remove a problem child from school. These are just some of the many, many reforms contained in this bill. There has been a sense among many Americans that we are powerless to re-verse the trend of violence. People be-lieve we are powerless to deal with vio-lent juvenile crime and that we are powerless to change our culture. It is this feeling of powerlessness which threatened our collective ambition for meaningful, penetrating solutions in the wake of the Littleton tragedy. I be-lieve the Senate has taken a meaning-ful step towards shedding this defeat-ism. Do I agree with everything in this bill? No. For example, I oppose to the gun show regulatory and taxing amendment. But addressing this gun show issue has been evolutionary. Both sides have moved on this and\u2014per-haps\u2014we can find common ground as the bill moves through the House and conference. Given the seriousness of our youth violence problem\u2014and the number of warning signs that tragedies will con-tinue unless all of us come together\u2014 we must move forward. We should join together and pass this bill. Finally, in closing I want to end this debate with a reminder. We have been on this bill for two weeks talking about violent juvenile crime, about the events in Littleton, about kids who use guns, and about kids influenced by vio-lence in the media. Unfortunately, all of that is very true. But let us not lose sight of the fact that there are millions of kids in this country, hundreds of thousands in Utah, who are really good young peo-ple. We give a lot of attention and this bill focuses even more of it on young people who get into trouble with the law. Let's not forget that about the kids who fly straight. As we wrap up consideration of this bill, let's thank the millions of young people across this land that work hard, study long hours, respect and love their parents and friends, and care for others around them. Mr. President, I would like added as cosponsors of this bill and have their names appear as cosponsors imme-diately following my name: Senator L EAHY , Senator S ESSIONS , Senator BIDEN and Senator F EINSTEIN . I am very proud to be able to be the prime sponsor with these wonderful cospon-sors. Senator B IDEN was one of the first co- sponsors on this bill. I am more than pleased that my ranking member, Sen-ator L EAHY is a cosponsor and a prime cosponsor. S. 254 is a testament to those who worked on it and a product which, on the whole, will help our young people and do something significant about the problems of juvenile crime. I want to thank a few of the people who have worked on this bill. Let me first acknowledge the Majority Leader who worked with me to keep this bill alive. Given the demanding Senate schedule, it would have been easier for him to have refused to take up the bill or pull it down. We have a bill passing the Senate because he wanted to do what's right. Let me also acknowledge Ranking Member, Senator L EAHY . He and I reached agreement on this important bill after much discussion and he ably managed the bill for his side of the aisle. I also want to commend Senator S ES- SIONS \u2014the Chairman of the Youth Vio- lence Subcommittee. S. 254 became the vehicle for quite of bit of politically charged legislation but it was Senator S ESSIONS who stayed on me for more than two years and who never lost sight of the need to make the juvenile justice reforms we make in the under-lying bill. Also, let me commend Senator B IDEN who came on this bill as a cosponsor when others were unwilling. A leader on crime control issues, he was instru-mental in setting a cooperative tone which helped get this bill moving. Senator A LLARD , Senator C RAIG, Sen- ator B ROWNBACK , and Senator ASHCROFT are to be commended for their leadership and counsel. Senator F EINSTEIN should be applauded for her cooperation. There are many others but I will end it there. At the staff level, I want to commend several people. First, on the Judiciary Committee staff, let me acknowledge a few people who have worked very hard on this bill. Committee Counsels Rhett Dehart and Mike Kennedy are to be commended for their lead work on this important bill. When others were skeptical about its prospects they were there to make the substantive case for moving this bill. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5727 May 20, 1999 They worked very hard, for several years, to get this bill introduced, re-ported, and passed. This bill's passage is a testament to their tireless efforts. In addition, I want to acknowledge and thank Kristi Lee, the Chief Coun-sel of the Youth Violence sub-committee for her work. I also want to commend a few others on the Committee Staff: Sharon Prost, Anna Cabral, Ed Haden, Parker, Krista Redd, and Luke Austin. They all worked around the clock on this bill. The amount of preparation that goes into these bills is significant and they were given little time to prepare for the floor. They are a great staff and I thank them for their efforts. Thanks as well should be given to the Commit-tee's Chief Counsel and Staff Director, Manus Cooney. He is one of the first staff directors in the committee's his-tory. On Senator L EAHY 's committee staff I want to acknowledge the Minority Chief Counsel\u2014Bruce Cohen for his co-operative efforts and leadership. Beryl Howell, Senator L EAHY 's General Coun- sel should also be commended for her substantive work on the underlying Hatch-Leahy substitute and managers' package. Ed Barron is a true gen-tleman and an able lawyer. Let me also acknowledge the Youth Violence Subcommittee's Minority Chief Counsel, Sheryl Walter and Glen Shor with the Criminal Justice Overight Subcommittee. Others I would be remiss in not men- tioning include: Dave Hoppie, Robert Wilkie, and Jim Hecht the Majority Leader's staff; Stewart Verdery and Eric Euland of the Whip's office; Ken Foss, Candi Wolff, and Jade West of the Policy Committee; Mike Bennett, Karen Knutson, Kris Ardizzone, David Crane, and Paul Clement. Let me acknowledge the hard work of Mary Kay MacMillan, Tony Coe, Bill Jensen, and Tim Trushel of the Senate Legislative Counsel's office, who all put in extraordinary effort in preparing this bill and many amendments. And finally, I would be remiss if I did not express thanks to our wonderful floor and cloakroom staff: Elizabeth Letchworth, Hiton, Dan Dukes, Laura Martin, and Myra Baron. These folks keep things running during our hectic debates, and we appreciate them. I am very grateful to finally have this ordeal over. It has been a very, very difficult bill, as all of these crime bills usually are. I think if anybody tries to make this just a gun bill, they have missed the point of what we have accomplished here. Sure, there have been some amend- ments on guns that are very crucial and very important in the eyes of many people on the floor, but this bill is so much more\u2014ranging from ac-countability, calling on youth to be re-sponsible for their actions, to preven-tion moneys. For the first time in years, we have balanced prevention and accountability and law enforcement. The law enforcement aspect will help bring the law down on violent juveniles and others who aid them in commit-ting these crimes. We have made real inroads and we have taken a number of very important steps with regard to changing the culture of violence in our society. That is important. Yes, we faced some tough amendments on guns. I don't like all of the results on this bill. But the fact of the matter is, they were votes, they were voted up and down, the Senate has spoken, and we need to recognize that for what it is. At this point I again express my ap- preciation to my friend, Senator L EAHY , for the patience he has had with me, the patience he has had on the floor, the assistance he has been. It has been a real privilege to work for him. I respect and admire him and hope to do a lot of constructive things with him in the future. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator from Utah for his kind remarks. We have worked very closely together on this. We have seen a bill go through a major evolution on the floor. Frankly, that is what the Senate should do in working its will through a bill. But I must say to my friend from Utah, I do not think that would have been possible if he and I had not been able to work together, if we had not been in constant contact, day by day, hour by hour and, perhaps to his regret at times, minute by minute. I once said Senators are merely con- stitutional impediments to their staff\u2014maybe I said it more than once. If we had not had superb staffs working on this, I do not know what we could have done. We had Senators who came together, even though they normally seem politi-cally far apart. The distinguished Sen-ator from Alabama, Senator S ESSIONS , an original cosponsor of this bill; the distinguished Senator from Delaware, Senator B IDEN; myself and Senator HATCH \u2014coming together, bringing so many other Senators together. One need only look at the major managers' package we passed. I say to my friend from Utah, I think when we introduced our managers' amendment that, as much as anything, broke the logjam and made passage of this bill possible. We tried to accommodate many Senators on both sides of the aisle who had legitimate matter of con-cern. In that process we came together to shape a bill. The managers' amend-ment agreement was more than just saying what is good for one Senator or another Senator. This is a juvenile jus-tice bill and the managers' amendment helped shape the contours of that col-lective product. As a parent, I think back to the time when my children were going to school. I thought what a happy and wonderful time in their life it was. I knew it was one place where they were safe. We did not have to worry about anything more than, did they study enough for their geometry test or history test or did they get their English assignment in on time? The worst injury you might worry about was if somebody in the playground was to slip and fall and bruise an arm or a leg. Parents should not have to worry about their children going to school. But even today as we debated this\u2014as we talked about Columbine, where the President and the First Lady were traveling today\u2014we saw, again, on the TV, pictures of another school shooting by another juvenile in Georgia, leaving children injured and being flown to a hospital. Every parent in this country is reminded, again, that often today our children are not safe, even when we send them off to a place where they should be. That is not the way it should be. We have worked tirelessly on this bill. I think it is a better bill than when it began. The intentions were al-ways the same: To make sure our juve-niles are safe, our people are safe, that we choose the right course for juveniles when they do commit crimes. The Senate has improved this bill. It is more comprehensive and more re-spectful of the core protections in the Federal juvenile legislation that served us well in past decades. It is more re-spectful of the primary role of the States in prosecuting these matters. We do recognize that no legislation is perfect, legislation alone is not enough to stop youth violence. I hope parents, teachers, and juve- niles themselves will stop and say: Can we not do better? Can we not have time together? Can we not love our children as we should? Can we not love each other as we should? Can we not look at some of the principles I knew so well when I was growing up, given to me by my parents, principles I hope my wife and I passed on to our children? Can we not go to those basic prin- ciples and understand, even in a coun-try of a quarter of a billion people, that we do not need the violence we see in this country? It is not just a question of gun con- trol. It is not just a question of more courts or more police. It is not just a question of more laws. But it is a ques-tion of, what do we want to be as a na-tion? We are blessed in this nation. We are the most powerful, wealthiest na-tion history has ever known. We live better than anybody ever could have imagined. We have so much going for us. Should not we stop and say, when it comes to our children, the most pre-cious resource we have, that we must do all that we can to protect them and nurture them and teach them to be re-sponsible? Since we began consideration of this important legislation last week, we VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5728 May 20, 1999 have gotten both good news and bad news on the crime front. We got the good news at the beginning of this week when the FBI released the latest crime rate statistics showing a decline in serious crime for the seventh con-secutive year. Preliminary reports in-dicate that the rate of serious violent and property crime in this country went down another 7 percent in 1998, with robbery down 11 percent, murders down 8 percent, car thefts down 10 per-cent, and declines in other crime cat-egories as well. But we are all acutely aware that we also got bad news today. Yet another school shooting by a juvenile\u2014this time in Georgia\u2014with children injured and being flown to hospitals. Every parent in this country is reminded again that our children are not safe, even when we send them off to a place where they should be. The only thing parents should have to worry about when they wave good-bye to their chil-dren in the morning is whether their child remembered his or her homework and lunch money. They should not have to worry about whether they will get shot. The growing list of schoolyard shoot- ings by children in Arkansas, Wash-ington, Oregon, Tennessee, California, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Mississippi, last month in Littleton, Colorado, and today in Georgia, is simply unaccept-able and intolerable. Each one of us wants to do something to stop this violence. We have before us a bill that reflects hard work and com-mitted effort on both sides of the aisle to address the juvenile crime problem. Senator H ATCH and Senator S ESSIONS have worked tirelessly for several years now to make a difference. While we have strongly disagreed in the past on the right approach to juvenile crime, I have always respected their good intentions. I am glad that this year we have continued the progress we made in the last Congress to find com-mon ground on this important legisla-tion. In light of the significant improve- ments we have been able to make to the bill here on the Senate floor over the last eight days, the bill is a better, stronger and better balanced bill. It is more comprehensive and more respect-ful of the core protections in federal ju-venile justice legislation that have served us so well over the last three decades. At the same time it is more respectful of the primary role of the states in prosecuting these matters. I greatly appreciate the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee adding me as a principal cosponsor of our bill. I recognize, as we all do, that no leg- islation is perfect and that legislation alone is not enough to stop youth vio-lence. We can pass an assortment of new laws and still turn on the news to find out that some child somewhere in the country has turned violent and turned on other children and teachers, with a gun or other weapon, with ter-rible results. All of us\u2014whether we are parents, grandparents, teachers, psychologists, or policy-makers\u2014are puzzling over the causes of kids turning violent in our country. The root causes are likely multi-faceted. We can all point to inad-equate parental involvement or super-vision, over-crowded classrooms and over-sized schools that add to students' alienation, the easy accessibility of guns, the violence depicted on tele-vision, in movies and video games, or inappropriate content available on the Internet. There is no single cause and no single legislative solution that will cure the ill of youth violence in our schools or in our streets. Nevertheless, this legislation is a firm and signifi-cant step in the right direction. I have said before that a good pro- posal that works should get the sup-port of all of us. Our first question should be whether a program or pro-posal will help our children effectively, not whether it is a Democratic or Re-publican proposal. The Managers' amendment and package of amend-ments that the Chairman and I were able to put together for adoption yes-terday reflects that philosophy. It shows that when this body rolls up its sleeves and gets to work, we can make significant progress. I commend the Chairman for his leadership in this ef-fort and I am glad we were able to work together constructively to im-prove this bill. This bill, S. 254, started out as a much-improved bill from the one re-ported by the Judiciary Committee in the last Congress. In fact, as I looked through this bill I was pleasantly sur-prised to see that proposals that the Republicans on the Judiciary Com-mittee specifically voted down in 1997 were incorporated at the outset into this bill. These are changes that I and other Democrats have been urging on our Republican colleagues for the past few years, and that they have resisted until they quietly incorporated them into this bill. Federalism. For example, I tried in July 1997 to amend S. 10 to protect the State's traditional prerogative in han-dling juvenile offenders and avoid the unnecessary federalization of juvenile crime that so concerns the Chief Jus-tice and the Federal judiciary. Specifi-cally, my 1997 amendment would have limited the federal trial as an adult of juveniles charged with nonviolent felo-nies to circumstances when the State is unwilling or unable to exercise juris-diction. This amendment was defeated, with all the Republicans voting against it. This bill, S. 254, contained a new pro- vision designed to address these fed-eralism concerns that would direct fed-eral prosecutors to ''exercise a pre-sumption in favor of referral'' of juve-nile cases to the appropriate State or tribal authorities, where there is ''con-current jurisdiction,'' unless the State declines jurisdiction and there is a sub-stantial federal interest in the case. Yet, concerns remained that this bill would undermine a State's tradition- ally prerogative to handle juvenile of-fenders. The changes we make to the under- lying bill in the Hatch-Leahy Man-agers' amendment satisfy my concerns. For example, S. 254 as introduced would repeal the very first section of the Federal Criminal Code dealing with ''Correction of Youthful Offenders.'' This is the section that establishes a clear presumption that the States\u2014not the federal government\u2014should handle most juvenile offenders [18 U.S.C. sec-tion 5001]. While the original S. 254 would repeal that provision, the Man-agers' amendment retains it in slightly modified form. In addition, the original S. 254 would require Federal prosecutors to refer most juvenile cases to the State in cases of ''concurrent jurisdiction . . . over both the offense and the juvenile.'' This language created a recipe for sharp lawyering. Federal prosecutors could avoid referral by simply claiming there was no ''concurrent'' jurisdiction over the ''offense'' due to linguistic or other differences between the federal and state crimes. Even if the juvenile's conduct violated both Federal and State law, any difference in how those criminal laws were written could be used to argue they were different of-fenses altogether. This was a huge loophole that could have allowed fed-eral prosecutors to end-run the pre-sumption of referral to the State. We fix this in the Managers' Amend- ment, and clarify that whenever the federal government or the State have criminal laws that punish the same conduct and both have jurisdiction over the juvenile, federal prosecutors should refer the juvenile to the State in most instances. Finally, I was concerned that, con- trary to current law, a federal prosecu-tor's decision to proceed against a ju-venile in federal court would not be subject to any judicial review. The Managers' Amendment would permit such judicial review, except in cases in-volving serious violent or serious drug offenses. Federal Trial of Juveniles as Adults. Another area of concern has been the ease with which S. 254 would allow fed-eral prosecutors to prosecute juveniles 14 years and older as adults for any fel-ony. While I have long favored simpli-fying and streamlining current federal procedures for trying juveniles, I be-lieve that judicial review is an impor-tant check in the system, particularly when you are dealing with children. This bill, S. 254, included a ''reverse waiver'' proposal allowing for judicial review of most cases in which a juve-nile is charged as an adult in federal court. I had suggested a similar pro-posal in July 1997, when I tried to amend S. 10 before the Judiciary Com-mittee to permit limited judicial re-view of a federal prosecutor's decision to try certain juveniles as adults. S. 10 granted sole, non-reviewable authority to federal prosecutors to try juveniles VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5729 May 20, 1999 as adults for any federal felony, remov- ing federal judges from that decision altogether. My 1997 amendment would have granted federal judges authority in appropriate cases to review a pros-ecutor's decision and to handle the ju-venile case in a delinquency proceeding rather than try the juvenile as an adult. Only three States in the country granted prosecutors the extraordinary authority over juvenile cases that S. 10 proposed, including Florida. Earlier this year, we saw the consequences of that kind of authority, when a local prosecutor in that State charged as an adult a 15-year-old mildly retarded boy with no prior record who stole $2 from a school classmate to buy lunch. The local prosecutor charged him as an adult and locked him up in an adult jail for weeks before national press coverage forced a review of the charg-ing decision in the case. This was not the kind of incident I wanted happening on the federal level. Unfortunately, my proposal for a ''re-verse waiver'' procedure providing judi-cial review of a prosecutor's decision was voted down in Committee, with no Republican on the Committee voting for it. I was pleased that S. 254 contained a ''reverse waiver'' provision, despite the Committee's rejection of this proposal two years ago. Though made belated, this was a welcome change in the bill. The Managers' amendment makes im-portant improvements to that provi-sion. First, S. 254 gives a juvenile defend- ant only 20 days to file a reverse waiver motion after the date of the juvenile's first appearance. This time is too short, and could lapse before the juve-nile is indicted and is aware of the ac-tual charges. The Managers' amend-ment extends the time to make a re-verse waiver motion to 30 days, which begins at the time the juvenile defend-ant appears to answer an indictment. Second, S. 254 requires the juvenile defendant to show by ''clear and con-vincing'' evidence that he or she should be tried as a juvenile rather than an adult. This is a very difficult standard to meet, particularly under strict time limits. Thus, the Managers' amend-ment changes this standard to a ''pre-ponderance'' of the evidence. Juvenile Records. As initially intro- duced, S. 254 would require juvenile criminal records for any federal of-fense, no matter how petty, to be sent to the FBI. This criminal record would haunt the juvenile as he grew into an adult, with no possibility of expungement from the FBI's database. The Managers' amendment makes important changes to this record re-quirement. The juvenile records sent to the FBI will be limited to acts that would be felonies if committed by an adult. In addition, under the Managers' amendment, a juvenile would be able after 5 years to petition the court to have the criminal record removed from the FBI database, if the juvenile can show by clear and convincing evidence that he or she is no longer a danger to the community. Expungement of records from the FBI's database does not apply to juveniles convicted of rape, murder or certain other serious felonies. Increasing Witness Tampering Pen- alties. This bill, S. 254, also contains a provision to increase penalties for wit-ness tampering that I first suggested and included in the ''Youth Violence, Crime and Drug Abuse Control Act of 1997,'' S. 15, which was introduced in the first weeks of the 105th Congress, at the end of the last Congress in the ''Safe Schools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act of 1998,'' S. 2484, and again in S. 9, the comprehensive package of crime proposals introduced with Sen-ator D ASCHLE at the beginning of this Congress. This provision would in-crease the penalty for using or threat-ening physical force against any person with intent to tamper with a witness, victim or informant from a maximum of ten to twenty years' imprisonment. In addition, the provision adds a con-spiracy penalty for obstruction of jus-tice offenses involving witnesses, vic-tims and informants. I have long been concerned about the undermining of our criminal justice system by criminal efforts to threaten or harm witnesses, victims and inform-ants, to stop them from cooperating with and providing assistance to law enforcement. I tried to include this provision, along with several other law enforcement initiatives, by amendment to S. 10 during Committee mark-up on July 11, 1997, but this amendment was voted down by all the Republicans on the Committee. At the end of the mark-up, however, this witness tam-pering provision was quietly accepted to S. 10 and I am pleased that it is also included in S. 254. Eligibility Requirements for Ac- countability Block Grant. This bill, S. 254, substantially relaxes the eligibility requirements for the new juvenile ac-countability block grant. By contrast, S. 10 in the last Congress would have required States to comply with a host of new federal mandates to qualify for the first cent of grant money, such as permitting juveniles 14 years and older to be prosecuted as adults for violent felonies, establishing graduated sanc-tions for juvenile offenders, imple-menting drug testing programs for ju-veniles upon arrest, and nine new juve-nile record-keeping requirements. These record-keeping mandates would have required, for example, that States fingerprint and photograph juveniles arrested for any felony act and send those records to the FBI, plus make all juvenile delinquency records available to law enforcement agencies and to schools, including colleges and univer-sities. We could find no State that would have qualified for this grant money without agreeing to change their laws in some fashion to satisfy the twelve new mandates. In 1997, I tried to get the Judiciary Committee to relax the new juvenile record-keeping mandates under the ac- countability grant program during the mark-up of S. 10. My 1997 amendment would have limited the record-keeping requirements to crimes of violence or felony acts committed by juveniles, rather than to all juvenile offenses no matter how petty. But my amendment was voted down on July 23, 1997, by the Republicans on the Committee. Fi-nally, two years later, S. 254 reflects the criticism I and others Democrats on the Judiciary Committee leveled at the strict eligibility and record-keep-ing requirements in S. 10. Indeed, the Senate decisively re- jected this approach when it defeated an amendment by a Republican Sen-ator that would have revived those straight-jacket eligibility require-ments. Specifically, his amendment would have required States to try as adults juveniles 14 years or older who committed certain crimes. As I pointed out during floor debate on this amend-ment, only two States would have qualified for grant funds unless they agreed to change their laws. Moreover, the current bill removes the record-keeping requirements alto-gether from the Juvenile Account-ability Block Grant. Instead, S. 254 sets up an entirely new Juvenile Criminal History Block Grant, funded at $75 mil-lion per year. To qualify for a criminal history grant, States would have to promise within three years to keep fin-gerprint supported records of delin-quency adjudications of juveniles who committed a felony act. No more pho-tographs required. No more records of mere arrests required. No more dis-semination of petty juvenile offense records to schools required. Instead, only juvenile delinquency adjudica-tions for murder, armed robbery, rape or sexual molestation must be dissemi-nated in the same manner as adult records; other juvenile delinquency ad-judications records may only be used for criminal justice purposes. These limitations are welcome changes to the burdensome, over-broad record-keeping requirements in the prior version of the Republican juvenile crime bill. The eligibility requirements for the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant now number only three, including that the State have in place a policy of drug testing for appropriate categories of ju-veniles upon arrest. Core Protections for Children. Much of the debate over reforming our juve-nile justice system has focused on how we treat juvenile offenders who are held in State custody. Republican ef-forts to roll back protections for chil-dren in custody failed in the last Con-gress. These protections were origi-nally put in place when Congress en-acted the Juvenile Justice and Delin-quency Prevention Act of 1974 to create a formula grant program for States to improve their juvenile justice systems. This Act addressed the horrific condi-tions in which children were being de-tained by State authorities in close proximity to adult inmates\u2014conditions VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov \u2014 SENATE S5730 May 20, 1999 that too often resulted in tragic as- saults, rapes and suicides of children. As the JJDPA has evolved, four core protections have been adopted\u2014and are working\u2014to protect children from adult inmates and to ensure develop-ment of alternative placements to adult jails. These four core protections for juvenile delinquents are: Separation of juvenile offenders from adult inmates in custody (known as sight and sound separation); Removal of juveniles from adult jails or lockups, with a 24-hour exception in rural areas and other exceptions for travel and weather related conditions; Deinstitutionalizaton of status of- fenders; and to study and direct pre-vention efforts toward reducing the disproportionate confinement of mi-nority youth in the juvenile justice system. Over strong objection by most of the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee in the last Congress, S. 10 eliminated three of the four core protections and substantially weakened the ''sight and sound'' separation standard for juve-niles in State custody. At the same time the Committee appeared to ac-knowledge the wisdom and necessity of such requirements when it adopted an amendment requiring separation of ju-veniles and adult inmates in Federal custody. This bill, S. 254, as introduced was an improvement over S. 10 in its retention of modified versions of three out of the four core protections. Specifically, S. 254 included the sight and sound stand-ard for juveniles in Federal custody re-flected in a 1997 amendment to S. 10. The same standard is used to apply to juveniles delinquents in State custody. Legitimate concerns were raised that the prohibition on physical contact in S. 254 would still allow supervised prox-imity between juveniles and adult in-mates that is ''brief and incidental or accidental,'' since this could be inter-preted to allow routine and regular\u2014 though brief\u2014exposure of children to adult inmates. For example, guards could routinely escort children past open adult cells multiple times a day on their way to a dining area. The Hatch-Leahy managers' Amend- ment makes significant progress on the ''sight and sound separation'' protec-tion and the ''jail removal'' protection. Specifically, our Managers' amend-ment makes clear that when parents in rural areas give their consent to have their children detained in adult jails after an arrest, the parents may revoke their consent at any time. In addition, the judge who approves the juvenile's detention must determine it is in the best interests of the juvenile, and may review that detention\u2014as the judge must periodically\u2014in the presence of the juvenile. The managers' amendment also clari- fies that juvenile offenders in rural areas may be detained in an adult jail for up to 48 hours while awaiting a court appearance, but only when no al-ternative facilities are available and appropriate juvenile facilities are too far away to make the court appearance or travel is unsafe to undertake. The Hatch-Leahy managers' amend- ment also significantly improves the sight and sound separation require-ment for juvenile offenders in both Federal and State custody. The amend-ment incorporates the guidance in cur-rent regulations for keeping juveniles separated from adult prisoners. Specifi-cally, the Managers' amendment would require separation of juveniles and adult inmates and excuse only ''brief and inadvertent or accidental'' prox-imity in non-residential areas, which may include dining, recreational, edu-cational, vocational, health care, entry areas, and passageways. I am pleased we were able to make this progress. I appreciate that a num-ber of Members remain seriously con-cerned, as do I, about how S. 254 changes the disproportionate minority confinement protection in current law. This bill, S. 254, removes any reference to minorities and requires only that ef-forts be made to reduce over-represen-tation of any segment of the popu-lation. I am disappointed that Senators W ELLSTONE and K ENNEDY 's amendment to restore this protection did not suc-ceed yesterday, but will continue to fight in conference to restore this pro-tection. Prevention. S. 254 includes a $200 mil- lion per year Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Challenge Grant to fund both primary prevention and interven-tion uses after juveniles have had con-tact with the juvenile justice system. I and a number of other members were concerned that in the competition for grant dollars, the primary prevention uses would lose out to intervention uses in crucial decisions on how this grant money would be spent. With the help of Senator K OHL, we have included in the Hatch-Leahy Managers' amend-ment a clear earmark that eighty per-cent of the money, or $160 million per year if the program is fully funded, is to be used for primary prevention uses and the other twenty percent is to be used for intervention uses. Together with the 25 percent earmark, or about $112 million per year if that program is fully funded, for primary prevention in the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant that was passed by the Senate in the Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment, this bill now reflects a substantial amount of solid funding for primary prevention uses. Prosecutors' Grants. I expressed some concern when the Senate passed the Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment authorizing $50 million per year for prosecutors and different kinds of as-sistance to prosecutors to speed up prosecution of juvenile offenders. I pointed out that this amendment did not authorize any additional money for judges, public defenders, counselors, or corrections officers. The consequence would be to only exacerbate the back-log in juvenile justice systems rather than helping it. The Managers' amendment fixes that by authorizing $50 million per year in grants to State juvenile court systems to be used for increased resources to State juvenile court judges, juvenile prosecutors, juvenile public defenders, and other juvenile court system per-sonnel. Sense of Senate. I mentioned before that S. 254 includes a Sense of the Sen- ate resolution urging States to try ju-veniles 10 to 14 years old as adults for crimes, such as murder, that would carry the death penalty if committed by an adult\u2014the resolution does not urge the death penalty for such chil-dren. While Vermont is probably one of the few States that expressly allows for the trial of juveniles 10 years and older as adults for certain crimes, I do not believe that this is a matter on which the Senate must or should opine. The Managers' amendment correctly de-letes that Sense of the Senate from the bill. State Advisory Groups. S. 254 incor- porates changes I recommended to S. 10 in the last Congress to ensure the con-tinued existence and role of State Ad-visory Groups, or SAGs, in the develop-ment of State plans for addressing ju-venile crime and delinquency, and the use of grant funds under the JJDPA. As originally introduced, S. 10 had abol-ished the role of SAGs. The Judiciary Committee in 1997 adopted my amend-ment to preserve SAGs and require rep-resentation from a broad range of juve-nile justice experts from both the pub-lic and private sectors. While, as introduced, S. 254 preserved SAGs, it eliminated the requirement in current law that gives SAGs the oppor-tunity to review and comment on a grant award to allow these experts to provide input on how best to spend the money. In addition, while the bill au-thorizes the use of grant funds to sup-port the SAG, the bill does require States to commit any funds to ensure these groups can function effectively. I am pleased that the Chairman and I were able to accept an amendment sponsored by Senators K ERREY , ROB- ERTS , and others, to ensure appropriate funding of SAGs at the State level and to support their annual meetings. Protecting Children From Guns. Sig- nificantly, we have amended this bill with important gun control measures that we all hope will help make this country safer for our children. The bill as now been amended: bans the transfer to and possession by juveniles of as-sault weapons and high capacity am-munition clips; increases criminal pen-alties for transfers of handguns, as-sault weapons, and high capacity am-munition clips to juveniles; bans pro-spective gun sales to juveniles with violent crime records; expands the youth crime gun interdiction initiative to up to 250 cities by 2003 for tracing of guns used in youth crime; and in-creases federal resources dedicated to enforcement of firearms laws by $50 million a year. These common-sense initiatives were first included in the VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5731 May 20, 1999 comprehensive Leahy law enforcement amendment that was tabled by the ma-jority, but were later included in suc-cessful amendments sponsored by Re-publican Senators. No matter how these provisions were finally included in the bill, they will help keep guns out of hands of children and criminals, while protecting the rights of law abid-ing adults to use firearms. In addition, through the efforts of Senators L AUTENBERG , S CHUMER , KERREY and others, we were able to re- quire background checks for all fire-arm purchases at all gun shows. After three Republican amendments failed to close the gun show loophole in the Brady law, and, in fact, created many new loopholes in the law, we finally prevailed. With the help of Vice Presi-dent G ORE's tie-breaking vote, a major- ity in the U.S. Senate stood up to the gun lobby and did the right thing. This is real progress. Conclusion. I said at the outset of the debate on this bill that I would like nothing bet-ter than to pass responsible and effec- tive juvenile justice legislation. I want to pass juvenile justice legislation that will be helpful to the youngest citizens in this country\u2014not harm them. I want to pass juvenile justice legislation that assists States and local governments in handling juvenile offenders\u2014not im-pose a ''one-size-fits-all'' Washington solution on them. I want to prevent ju-veniles from committing crimes, and not just narrowly focus on punishing children. I want to keep children who may harm others away from guns. This bill would make important contribu-tions in each of these areas, and I am pleased to support its passage. I thank the Republican manager of this important measure for his work and dedication to this effort. I com-mend the Minority Leader and the Mi-nority Whip for their assistance and at-tention to this debate. There would not be a juvenile justice bill without them. I thank Senator K ENNEDY , Senator SCHUMER , Senator K OHL and all the Democratic Members of the Judiciary Committee for helping manage this ef-fort. Senators B INGAMAN , ROBB, BOXER , WELLSTONE and L AUTENBERG should also be singled out for their consistent efforts to improve this bill. And I would like to thank the staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Repub-lican and Democrat, including Manus Cooney, Sharon Prost, Rhett DeHart, Michael Kennedy and Anna Cabral from Chairman H ATCH 's staff and Bruce Cohen, Beryl Howell, Ed Pagano, Ed Barron, J.P. Dowd, Julie Katzman and Michael Carrasco from my own. In ad-dition Michael Myers, Stephaine Rob-inson, Melody Barnes and Angela Wil-liams from Senator K ENNEDY 's staff and Sheryl Walter, Jon Leibowitz, Brian Lee, Neil Quinter, David Hantman, Bob Schiff, Jennifer Leach and Glen Shor, Sander Lurie and Tony Orza were exceptional in staffing these matters. I thank them all for their dedication and public service. I thank Senators on both side of the aisle who worked with us, but I want to congratulate the distinguished chair- man and thank him for his help. Mr. HATCH. I likewise congratulate the ranking member. Mr. President, I ask 5 minutes be ac- corded to the subcommittee chairman of the Judiciary Committee who did more than any other single person to bring the good parts of this bill to the floor. He deserves a lot of recognition. This is his first term in the Senate. To have such a significant role on a bill of this magnitude I think is a great star in Senator S ESSIONS ' crown. I certainly recognize that and tell him what a pleasure it has been to work with him and with his staff in doing this. Let me just add one last thing. The Senator is right, the Senator from Vermont. We are here trying to save our children. We are here trying to make this a better world for them. We are here trying to make it clear to peo-ple in this country there is such a thing as discipline and we have to abide by certain rules in society. This bill will help a lot of young kids out there to realize there are rules and they are worthy rules; if they will abide by them, we will continue to have a great society for the next 200- plus years. To the extent this bill has come through, as extensive and good as it is, we owe a lot to the Senator from Georgia. I want to end this debate with a re- minder. We have been on this bill for 2 weeks talking about violent juvenile crime, about the events in Littleton, about kids who use guns and about kids influenced by violence in the media. Unfortunately for all of us, that is true. But let us not lose sight of the millions of kids in this country, hun-dreds of thousands in Utah, who are really good young people. We give a lot of attention, and the bill focuses even more, on young people who get into trouble with the law. Let us not forget that about the kids who fly straight. As we wrap up consider-ation of this bill, let's thank the mil-lions of young people across this land who work hard, study long hours, re-spect and love their parents and friends, and care for others around them. There are millions and millions of good kids in this country. What we are trying to make sure is the kids who were led astray, the kids who we think may not be so good, they are going to get a break\u2014or at least they are going to understand what the law is with re-gard to violence. This bill, I think, will go a long way to solving these prob-lems. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Alabama. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah, who is a master legislator, who took this bill through storms none of us expected would occur. This was an emotional time in America. It has generated an awful lot of amendments and ideas, some of which are good and some of which I frankly think are not healthy. I believe we need to focus on pros- ecuting criminals who use guns. It al-ways galled me as a former Federal prosecutor myself that here this ad-ministration blamed the Congress for not passing more laws when their own Department of Justice had allowed prosecutions of gun cases to drop 40 percent. You wonder why we are pass-ing laws if they are not using them. Those were some of the matters that came up. My vision for this bill from the beginning was to create a Federal program to assist the local juvenile justice systems in America. We put money where these judges and prosecu-tors and probation officers are over-whelmed by the huge crush of juvenile cases. We have increased funding dra-matically for adult programs for crimefighting but we have not done the same for juveniles. Those juveniles, then, come on and become adult crimi-nals. I hope everybody in America who cares about what is happening will ask how their juvenile court system is doing. Does the judge in their town have an option when a child is arrested to send them to prison, detention, boot camp, alternative schools, drug treat-ment, mental health, family coun-seling? Can the judge impose that? Can he impose a probation order and then have the resources to make sure that youngster is at home at night at 7 like he ordered, or do we do like most courts in America, because they do not have enough resources, so orders are written but nobody enforces them? If we love these children, if we care about these children, when they are ar-rested, we will drug test them, because if they are using drugs, they are going to continue in the life of crime. Sixty- seven to 70 percent of the people in America who are arrested for a felony test positive for an illegal drug. It is an accelerant to crime. This legislation does that kind of thing. It provides money for drug testing. It provides money for recordkeeping. We hope every juvenile court system in America will input criminal history records into the Federal NCIC, Na-tional Crime Information Center, that the FBI manages. They want these records because these children move around and some of them are very vio-lent. Those records need to be main-tained. This bill provides for that. It provides for research on which pro- grams are working. Many of them are not successful, according to the De-partment of Justice, and we need to make sure these prevention programs are working well. It provides for re-search for that. I am of a belief that this legislation\u2014 and it can use some work in con-ference, and I know Senator H ATCH and others will try to improve it\u2014can help us create a better juvenile justice sys-tem so we can intervene effectively at the first arrest. We can make that youngster's first brush with the law their last because we deal with them seriously and not as a revolving door. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5732 May 20, 1999 Sometimes we have to use some form of detention because some of these kids just will not mind otherwise. We know that. They have multiple arrests. I believe we have made some progress. I am honored to have worked with Senator L EAHY , Senator B IDEN, and certainly Senator H ATCH , the chairman of our committee. He is an outstanding legislator, a man of integ-rity and principle, and an outstanding constitutional lawyer who cares about his country and serves it well every day. I yield the floor. f MORNING BUSINESS Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to a period for morning business, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. f BUYING FLOOD DAMAGED VEHICLES Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, consumers, motor vehicle administrators, law en-forcement, and the automotive and in-surance industries anxiously await Congressional action on appropriate and workable title branding legisla-tion. Legislation that provides used car purchasers with much needed pre-pur-chase disclosure information for se-verely damaged vehicles. As a result of varying state ap- proaches, consumers are not always ad-vised of a vehicle's damage history. The National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act, S. 655, that I introduced back in March, would help correct this problem. It provides grant funds to states to encourage their adoption of uniform terms and proce-dures for salvage and other severely damaged vehicles. While a mandatory federal scheme was suggested during the last Congress, there were serious Constitutional concerns and the real potential that Congress would create an expensive unfunded mandate on states. The approach taken in S.655 overcomes these problems and provides states with offsetting funding. Mr. President, it is clear that any title branding legislation Congress adopts must contain a rational defini-tion for vehicles that sustain signifi-cant water damage. The Congressionally chartered Motor Vehicle Titling, Registration and Sal-vage Advisory Committee, whose rec-ommendations for curtailing title fraud and automobile theft spurred my sponsorship of S.655, came to the rea-soned conclusion that water damage was so potentially insidious in nature that a separate and distinct consumer disclosure category needed to be cre-ated. One that distinguished flood vehi-cles from salvage and nonrepairable ve-hicles. S. 655, which is similar to the bipar- tisan measure I coauthored with Sen-ator Ford during the last Congress, adopts a distinct flood vehicle category and improves upon the definition ini-tially proposed by the task force. Mr. President, I am sure my col- leagues are aware that the State of Illi-nois, which initially adopted the task force's recommended flood definition, subsequently revised it based on anti- consumer results. Illinois found that branding ''any vehicle that has been submerged in water to the point that rising water has reached over the door sill or has entered the passenger or truck compartment'' caused too many vehicles to be unnecessarily branded as ''flood'' vehicles. Vehicles that were significantly devalued and lost their manufacturers warranty when the only damage the vehicle suffered was wet carpets or wet floor mats. S.655 is a good example of the need to balance competing consumer interests when establishing uniform titling defi-nitions. Instead of unnecessarily and inappropriately branding vehicles with mere cosmetic damage, this legislation rightly brands as ''flood'' those vehi-cles which sustain water damage that impairs a car or truck's electrical, me-chanical, or computerized functions. It also requires the ''flood'' designation for vehicles acquired by an insurer as part of a water damage settlement. This measure also includes an inde-pendent flood inspection as rec-ommended by a working group of the National Association of Attorney's General. Mr. President, I ask my collegues to heed the call of used-car buyers and provide them with a reasonable and workable title branding measure. One that includes all of the minimal defini-tions needed to protect them from title fraud and automobile theft. f THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, at the close of business yesterday, Wednes-day, May 19, 1999, the federal debt stood at $5,593,797,968,334.37 (Five tril-lion, five hundred ninety-three billion, seven hundred ninety-seven million, nine hundred sixty-eight thousand, three hundred thirty-four dollars and thirty-seven cents). Five years ago, May 19, 1994, the fed- eral debt stood at $4,588,987,000,000 (Four trillion, five hundred eighty- eight billion, nine hundred eighty- seven million). Ten years ago, May 19, 1989, the fed- eral debt stood at $2,780,326,000,000 (Two trillion, seven hundred eighty billion, three hundred twenty-six million) which reflects a doubling of the debt\u2014 an increase of almost $3 trillion\u2014 $2,813,471,968,334.37 (Two trillion, eight hundred thirteen billion, four hundred seventy-one million, nine hundred sixty-eight thousand, three hundred thirty-four dollars and thirty-seven cents) during the past 10 years. NATIONAL MARITIME DAY Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize that today is National Maritime Day, when the Nation pays tribute to the American Merchant Mariners who have given their lives in the service of their country. Throughout the history of the United States, our U.S.-flag Merchant Marine has always been there, pro-viding the support that time and again has proven to be essential to victory. It is with the most profound gratitude for the service and sacrifice of America's Merchant Marine veterans that we re-flect upon the importance of our U.S.- flag fleet on this day. On April 29, 1999, I was privileged to be given a very special momento by a group of Merchant Marine Veterans of World War II. It was a patch, of the kind worn by Merchant Mariners dur-ing World War II, and it was designed in 1944 by Walt Disney Studios. Walt Disney's people created a mascot for the Merchant Marine, called ''Battlin' Pete,'' and the patch shows Pete knocking out an Axis torpedo. The presentation was made to ex- press the veterans' gratitude for a very important piece of legislation that the Senate passed last year. Last year's veterans' benefits bill ensures that those American Merchant Marine vet- erans who served our country in World War II between August 16, 1945\u2014the day that hostilities were officially de-clared at an end by President Tru-man\u2014and December 31, 1946\u2014the cut- off day for World War II service for all other service branches\u2014receive honor-able discharges for their service and are eligible for veterans' burial and cemetery benefits. This is the least we can do for these deserving veterans. I was privileged to introduce legislation during the 105th Congress seeking that change, and it was later incorporated into the veterans' benefits bill. The overwhelming majority of World War II Merchant Mariners were pre-viously awarded veterans status. Now, those who served in harm's way through the war's final days are also being recognized. Although Japan offi-cially surrendered in August of 1945, harbors in Japan, Germany, Italy, France\u2014indeed, across the world\u2014still were mined. Twenty-two U.S.-govern-ment-owned vessels, carrying military cargoes, were damaged or sunk by mines after V-J Day. At least four U.S. Merchant Mariners were killed and 28 injured aboard these vessels. Even as Americans at home were celebrating victory, American Merchant Mariners carried on as they have always done\u2014 bravely serving their country with pride and professionalism. I am proud that, at that April cere- mony, the first honorable discharges for this previously forgotten group went to two Merchant Marine veterans from my home state of Mississippi: Mr. Robert Hoomes and Mr. Louis Breaux. Also, I was pleased that Mr. Joseph Katusa, National Chairman, Merchant Marine Fairness Committee, received VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5733 May 20, 1999 his honorable discharge. The ceremony was attended by my good friend and colleague, Congressman B OBSTUMP , Chairman, House Veterans' Affairs Committee; Mr. Rudy de Leon, Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness; Admiral Jim Loy, Com-mandant, U.S. Coast Guard; and Mr. George Searle, National President, American Merchant Marine Veterans. I would like to thank them for partici-pating in the ceremony and acknowl-edging the service of Mr. Breaux, Mr. Hoomes, and Mr. Katusa, and the role that these, and all, Merchant Marine veterans played in preserving freedom. As we mark National Maritime Day, it is important to note that our coun-try's Merchant Mariners continue to stand ready to serve. In fact, the lead-ers of the major maritime labor unions\u2014the Marine Engineers' Bene-ficial Association; the International Organization of Masters, Mates and Pi-lots; the National Maritime Union of America; the American Maritime Offi-cers; and the Seafarers International Union of North America\u2014recently ex-pressed their readiness to support America's military effort in the Bal-kans. Recent reports that Greek sea-men are refusing to support that effort is a reminder of why the United States requires its own highly capable Mer-chant Marine. Mr. President, I will treasure that patch of ''Battlin' Pete'' from the Mer-chant Marine Veterans of World War II. It will always remind me of the impor-tance of National Maritime Day, and of the sacrifices that America's Merchant Mariner veterans have made in the service of their country. For those who braved the Murmansk run; for those who served through the conflicts in Korea, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf; for those who today stand ready to sail into harm's way with our Armed Forces; we salute you on this day. f EXPRESSION ON VOTES Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I regret that due to family business which took me out of the country, I was unable to cast several recorded votes during yesterday's session. While my vote would not have altered the outcome of any of the motions, I would like to express how I would have voted had I been able: On vote No. 120, a Cloture Motion re- garding the motion to proceed to con-sideration of S. 96, Y2K liability legis-lation. I would have voted ''AYE.'' It is high time we move to consideration of this important legislation. The turn of the millennium is fast approaching and we must work to protect our citizens and businesses against harmful litiga-tion that benefits no one. On vote No. 121, amendment num- bered 351 to S. 254 offered by Senator A LLARD regarding memorials in public schools, I would have voted ''AYE.'' This amendment will allow students and faculty members to grieve for classmates and colleagues killed on school property in a way that makes them most comfortable. On vote No. 122, an amendment num- bered 352 to S. 254 offered by Senators K OHLand H ATCH regarding mandatory safety locks on guns, I would have voted ''AYE.'' This amendment was an example of the importance of bipar-tisan compromise. The Kohl-Hatch amendment requires all handguns sold or transferred by a licensed dealer to be sold with a locking device. In addi-tion, this amendment provides impor-tant liability protections for gun own-ers who use these safety devices. On vote No. 13, an amendment num- bered 353 to S. 254 offered by Senators H ATCH and F EINSTEIN I would have voted ''AYE.'' This important amend-ment increased penalties for partici-pating in a crime as a gang member; makes it illegal to travel or use the mail for gang business; makes it illegal to transfer firearms to children to com-mit a crime; makes it illegal to clone pagers; prohibits the distribution of certain information relating to explo-sives or destructive devices; makes it illegal to wear body armor in the com-mission of a crime and donates surplus body armor to local Law enforcement agencies; and strengthens penalties for Eco-terrorism. On vote No. 124, an amendment to S. 254 offered by Senator B YRD I would have voted ''AYE.'' This amendment allows states to enforce their own alco-holic beverage control laws by allowing state prosecutors to bring an injunc-tion in Federal Court if interstate ship-pers violate State laws. f HEALTH AND THE AMERICAN CHILD Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, yesterday I met with former Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan, who now chairs the prestigious Public Health Policy Advisory Board (PHPAB). Dr. Sullivan presented to me their new report entitled ''Health and the American Child: A Focus on the Mortality Among Children.'' I was immediately struck by the fact that the findings of the PHPAB report underscore both the need for the legis-lation we are debating here today and the tremendous importance we must place on prevention efforts so that we can reduce unnecessary deaths of our Nation's youth. According to ''Health and the Amer- ican Child,'' in the past two decades, two causes of child death have dra-matically increased\u2014homicide and sui-cide, which account for 14% and 7% re-spectively of all deaths for children under age 19. In teenage black males, the levels are so striking that the re-port uses the term ''epidemic'' to de-scribe an eight-fold increase in homi-cide rates among African American youth, now their number one cause of death. ''Homicide and suicide, the greatest new risks to children's health today, require both heightened preventive ac-tion as well as research into children's mental health and the social fabric in which they grow and develop.'' And that is precisely what we have been talking about during our debate on S. 254. The PHPAB report goes on to define the contributing risk factors associ-ated with mortality in children. Homi-cide and suicide, as the major killers of our children, are most closely associ-ated with firearms, drug and alcohol use, and motor vehicles. These signifi-cant increases in both morbidity and mortality among our youth must be addressed and demand aggressive pre-ventive action on our part. I commend ''Health and the Amer- ican Child'' to my colleagues and would be glad to make it available to any Senators who care to have the benefit of its considerable findings. ''Health and the American Child'' is really a call to action. It shows so dramatically why this bill we are debating today is important, and why we must set par-tisan rhetoric aside to get this legisla-tion passed and enacted. f NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE ACT Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, on March 17, of this year the Senate passed S. 257, the National Missile De-fense Act of 1999, by a vote of 97-3. Sub-sequently, the House adopted as H.R. 4 a different version of the legislation, and today the House has agreed to the substance of the Senate bill. No further action is required on the bill, and it now goes to the President for his signa-ture. After many years of debate, Congress has passed legislation stating the na-tional policy to be that the United States will deploy a national missile defense as soon as technologically pos-sible. Section 2 of the bill notes that, like all discretionary programs, national missile defense is subject to the au- thorization and appropriation of funds. Section 3 states that we support the continued reductions in Russian nu-clear force levels. There is no linkage between Russian nuclear force levels, or any arms control agreement, and the national missile defense deploy-ment policy of the bill. I urge the President to sign this bill and put to rest the concerns of many that our country would continue its vulnerability to ballistic missile at-tack. With the signing of this bill, a new era of commitment to missile de-fense will begin. f TRADE Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue of critical im-portance to the domestic lamb indus-try and to producers in my home state of Wyoming. In September 1998, a coa-lition of individuals from all segments of the U.S. lamb industry filed a Sec-tion 201 trade petition with the U.S. International Trade Commission under laws VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5734 May 20, 1999 embedded in the Trade Act of 1974 and every trade act this nation has agreed to since that time. Our domestic industry filed this trade case in response to the surging, record-setting levels of imported lamb meat from Australia and New Zealand. These individuals, although rep-resenting different sectors of the U.S. lamb industry, collectively signed onto this legal battle because each entity has witnessed a drastic impact from lamb imports\u2014imports that increased nearly 50 percent between 1993 and 1997 and continue at an aggressive rate still today. Under a Section 201 petition, the International Trade Commission is re-quired to conduct an investigation to confirm or dispel the claims asserted within the trade case. Twice the Com-missioners heard arguments from both the domestic industry and the import-ers. Twice the Commissioners rejected the importers arguments. In both in-stances, the Commissioners voted unanimously\u2014during the injury phase in February and again in March, when they recommended that the President impose some form of trade relief. The Commission's report, and the indus-try's trade case, now await a final de-termination by President Clinton. According to the Commission's re- port, wholesale imported lamb cuts consistently undercut the price of iden-tical domestic cuts. Evidence of im-porters underselling domestically pro-duced lamb was found in 79 percent of the product-to-product comparisons with margins of 20 percent to 40 per-cent. Other comparisons have found margin disparities reaching as high as 70 percent. It is evident that our do-mestic industry is suffering from the flood of cheap, imported lamb that has swamped the U.S. market and forced prices below break-even levels. Time is of the essence in this matter as President Clinton has until June 4, 1999, to render his decision on what trade relief, if any, to implement. It is important to remember that under our own trade laws, the requirement of demonstrating that imports are threat-ening serious injury to the domestic in-dustry has been met. As a result, I urge the President to impose strong, effec-tive and temporary trade relief. More importantly, I urge the President to act on behalf of our producers by seri-ously considering the undisputed facts outlined in the Commission's report. f EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES EFFICIENCY ACT Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of all those who serve their fellow citizens through their ac-tive participation in the nation's emer-gency care system to make my re-marks on the introduction of S. 9-1-1, the ''Emergency Medical Services Act of 1999.'' Mr. President, as a Senator who is deeply concerned about the every-ex-panding size and scope of the federal government, I've long believed Wash- ington is too big, too clumsy and too removed to deal effectively with many of the issues in which it already med-dles. However, I also believe there's an overriding public health interest in en-suring a viable and seamless EMS sys-tem across the country. By designating this week as national EMS Week, our nation recognizes those individuals who make the EMS system work. There's no more appropriate time to reaffirm our commitment to EMS by addressing some of the problems the system is presented with daily. I've often said that Congress has a tendency to wait until there's a crisis before it acts, but Congress cannot wait until there's a crisis in the EMS system before we take steps to improve it. There's simply too much at stake. Whether we realize it or not, we all depend on and expect the constant readiness of emergency medical serv-ices. To ensure that readiness, we need to make efforts to secure the stability of the system. This has been my focus in drafting the EMSEA. The most important thing we can do to maintain the vitality of the EMS system is to compel the government to reimburse for the services it says it will pay for under Medicare. In the meetings I've had with ambu- lance providers, emergency medical technicians, emergency physicians, nurses, and other EMS-related per-sonnel, their most common request is to base reimbursement on a ''prudent layperson'' standard, rather than the ultimate diagnosis reached in the emergency room. While the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 [BBA] contained a provision basing reimbursement for emergency room services on the prudent layperson standard, I find it troubling HCFA re-fuses to include ambulance transpor-tation in its regulations as a service covered by the patient protections en-acted as part of Medicare Plus Choice. I also believe it is unacceptable that beneficiaries participating in fee-for- service are not granted the protections afforded to those in Medicare Plus Choice. There has been a great debate in the Senate for the last year regarding pro-tections for consumers against HMOs. Many of my colleagues would be star-tled to learn of the treatment many seniors have experienced at the hands of their own government through the Medicare fee-for-service program. The federal government would do better to lead by example rather than usurping powers from state insurance commis-sioners by imposing federal mandates on health insurance plans already gov-erned by the states. To illustrate how prevalent the prob- lem of the federal government denying needed care to Medicare beneficiaries is, I want to share with you a case my staff worked on relating to Medicare reimbursement for ambulance services. I mentioned this case last year, but it is worth repeating. Please keep in mind that this is the fee-for-service Medicare program. In 1994, Andrew Bernecker of Braham, Minnesota was mowing with a power scythe and tractor when he fell. The rotating blades of the scythe se- verely cut his upper arm. Mr. Bernecker tried to walk toward his home but was too faint from the blood loss, so he crawled the rest of the way. Afraid that his wife, who was 86 years old at the time, would panic\u2014or worse, have a heart attack\u2014he crawled to the pump and washed as much blood and dirt off as he could. His wife saw him and immediately called 911 for an am-bulance. He was rushed to the hospital where Mr. Bernecker ultimately spent some time in the intensive care unit and had orthopedic surgery. A tragic story. In response to the bills submitted to Medicare, the government sent this reply with respect to the ambulance billing: ''Medicare Regulations Provide that certain conditions must be met in order for ambulance services to be cov-ered. Medicare pays for ambulance services only when the use of any other method of transportation would endan-ger your health.'' The government de-nied payment, claiming the ambulance wasn't medically necessary. Apparently, Medicare believed the man's wife\u2014who was, remember, 86 years old\u2014should have been able to drive him to the hospital for treat-ment. Mr. and Mrs. Bernecker ap-pealed, but were denied and began pay-ing what they could afford each month for the ambulance bill. After several years of paying $20 a month, the Berneckers finally paid off the ambulance bill. Medicare later re-opened the case and reimbursed the Berneckers, but unfortunately, Mr. Bernecker is no longer with us. I have a few more examples I'd like to share with my colleagues to assure them this is not an isolated incident. In fact, I encourage all of my col-leagues to meet and speak with their EMS providers to see first-hand how the lack of consistent reimbursement policy impacts their ability to provide services. This one provision of the Emergency Medical Services Efficiency Act will bring fairness and clarity for both the beneficiary and the EMS pro-vider trying to help those in need. In Austin, Minnesota, a 66-year-old male was found in a shopping center parking lot slumped over the steering column of his car. The car was in drive, up against a light pole with the wheels spinning and the tread burning off the tires. An Austin policeman at the scene requested an ambulance and the driver was transported to the emergency room. Ambulance transportation reim-bursement was denied based on the as-sumption that the driver could have used other means to get to the emer-gency room. Apparently, since he was already in the car, he was supposed to drive himself to the hospital despite being unresponsive. Another case in Minnesota involved a 74-year-old male who was complaining VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5735 May 20, 1999 to his family about an upset stomach when he collapsed. The frightened fam-ily began CPR and summoned an ambu-lance via 9-1-1. The city's fire depart-ment was the first on scene and applied an automatic external defibrillator, which advised against shock. Para-medics arrived and continued CPR en route to the emergency room. The pa-tient ultimately died of cardiac arrest. Again, Medicare fee-for-service denied payment for the ambulance because it was deemed unnecessary. Finally, Mr. President, a 74-year-old female complained of flu-like symp-toms. Her family checked on her and found she was acting confused and strange. They summoned emergency medical services. Paramedics arrived to find the woman awake but confused as to time and events. They discovered she had a history of cardiac disease and diabetes. The paramedics tested her blood-sugar level and found it below 40. For those of you unfamiliar with diabe-tes, a blood sugar level below 70 is dan-gerous and could lead to seizure. But once again, Medicare denied payment. Mr. President, I have a stack of ac- tual run tickets from EMS providers in Minnesota, with names and other iden-tifiers deleted, all demonstrating what a problem this is for Medicare bene-ficiaries and EMS providers. Again, I urge all of my colleagues to meet with their EMS providers and ask how these denials affect them. Title II of the Emergency Medical Services Efficiency Act creates a Fed-eral Commission on Emergency Med-ical Services which will make rec-ommendations and provide input on how federal regulatory actions affect all types of EMS providers. EMS needs a seat at the table when health care and other regulatory policy is made. Few things are more frus-trating for ambulance services than trying to navigate and comply with the tangled mess of laws and regulations from the federal level on down, only to receive either a reimbursement that doesn't cover the costs of providing the service or a flat denial of payment. Mr. President, I came across this chart two years ago which dem-onstrates how a Medicare claim moves from submittal to payment, denial, or write-off by the ambulance provider. Look at this chart and tell me how a rural ambulance provider who depends on volunteers has the manpower or ex-pertise to navigate this mess. And, in the event it is navigated successfully, ambulance services are regularly reim-bursed at a level that doesn't even cover their costs. Mr. President, I have heard com- plaints from many individuals about the cost of ambulance care. In fact, some within this very body criticize ambulance providers for the high prices they charge for their services. While I do not doubt there are cases of abuse, I know for a fact an overwhelming ma-jority of EMTs, Paramedics, Emer-gency Nurses and EMS providers are trying to provide the best possible care for their patients at a reasonable price. Let's talk about how much it costs to run just one ambulance. There's the cost of the dispatcher who remains on the line to give pre-arrival assistance. The ambulance itself, which costs from $85,000 to $100,000. The radios, beepers, and cellular telephones used to com-municate between the dispatcher, am-bulance, and hospital. The supplies and equipment in the ambulance, including everything from defibrillators to ban-dages. The two Emergency Medical Technicians or Paramedics who both drive the ambulance and provide care to the patient. The vehicle repair, maintenance, and insurance costs. The liability insurance for the paramedics. And the list goes on. Yes, the costs can be high, but it's clear to me that, with the uncertainty ambulance providers face out in the field each day, they need to be prepared for very type of injury or condition. Mr. President, that's expensive. I'm convinced those who complain about the high costs of emergency care would be the first to complain if the ambulance that arrived to care for them in an emergency didn't have the life-saving equipment needed for treat-ment. Let's be honest with ourselves: we want the quickest and best service when we face an emergency\u2014and that costs money. Mr. President, many of our political debates in Washington center around how to better prepare for the 21st cen-tury. I've always supported research and efforts to expand the limits of technology and continue to believe technological innovations and ad-vances in biomedical and basic sci-entific research hold tremendous prom-ise. Under the new EMSEA, federal grant programs will be clarified to ensure EMS agencies are eligible for programs that relate to highway safety, rural de-velopment, and tele-health technology. Emergency Medical Services have come a long way since the first ambu-lance services began in Cleveland and New York City during the 1860s. Indeed, the scientific and techno- logical advances have created a new practice of medicine in two short dec-ades, and have dramatically improved the prospects of surviving serious trau-ma. There's reason to believe further advances will have equally meaningful results. Innovations like tele-health tech- nology may soon allow EMTs, nurses, and paramedics to perform more so-phisticated procedures under a physi-cian's supervision via real-time, ambu-lance-mounted monitors and cameras networked to emergency departments in specific service areas. By not consid-ering EMS agencies for federal grant dollars, we may cause significant delays in the application of current technologies. That would be a mistake. In August of 1996, the National High- way Traffic and Safety Administration and the Health Resources and Services Administration, Maternal and Child Health Bureau issued a report, ''Emer- gency Medical Services: Agenda for the Future.'' The report outlined specific ways EMS can be improved, and one of the stated goals was the authorization of a ''lead federal agency.'' After consultation with those in the EMS field throughout the country, I believe the most appropriate action is to take our time and get it right by conducting a study to determine which current or new office would best co-ordinate federal EMS efforts. Those are the major provisions of the legislation I introduce today. Mr. President, in 1995, there were ap- proximately 100 million visits to emer-gency departments across this nation. Roughly 20 percent of those visits started with a call for an ambulance. Each one of those calls is important, especially to those seeking assistance and to the responding EMS personnel. While EMS represents a small portion of health care spending overall, it is critically important. It serves as the access point for the sickest among us and it would be tragic for Congress to deny its role in improving the system. Over the past several years, I've been privileged to get to know the men and women who dedicate their talents to serving others in an emergency. The nation owes a great deal to the EMS personnel who have dedicated themselves to their profession because they care about people and want to help those who are suffering. Nobody gets rich as a professional paramedic, and there's no monetary compensation at all as a volunteer. The field of emer-gency medical services presents many challenges\u2014but offers the reward of knowing you helped someone in need of assistance. Every year, the American Ambulance Association recognizes EMS personnel across the country for their contribu-tions to the profession, and bestows upon them the Stars of Life Award. This year, 94 individuals have been chosen by their peers to be honored for demonstrating exceptional kindness and selflessness in performing their du-ties. Mr. President, Minnesota suffered a tremendous loss this year. On January 14, while extricating a victim of an automobile accident, two EMTs were hit by a car. Brenda HagE, an EMT and Registered Nurse, was transported in traumatic arrest to a nearby hospital where she was pronounced dead. Ms. HagE is survived by her husband Darby and two children. I ask that the Senate observe a mo- ment of silence for Ms. HagE and all EMS personnel who have died in the line of duty. Mr. President, I've talked with many professional EMTs, paramedics, and emergency nurses, and most tell me they wouldn't think of doing anything else for their chosen career. Similarly, volunteer EMS personnel tell me of the indescribable satisfaction they feel when they help those in their commu-nity get the care they need. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5736 May 20, 1999 So, in honoring them during this Na- tional EMS Week, I can think of no better way to recognize their service than through legislation that will help them help others. I ask my colleagues to support them by supporting S. 9-1-1, the ''Emergency Medical Services Act.''

A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia relative to the Omnibus Reconcili-ation Act of 1993; to the Committee on Fi-nance. SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 490 Whereas, prior to 1993, federal Medicaid regulations allowed states flexibility in the treatment of assets in determining eligi-bility; and Whereas, Connecticut, New York, Indiana, and California were able to establish public/ private long-term care partnerships to pro-vide incentives for the purchase of long-term care insurance; and Whereas, under these partnership pro- grams, if a policyholder requires long-term care and eventually exhausts his private in-surance benefits, the policyholder is per-mitted to keep more of his assets while still qualifying for Medicaid coverage; and VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov \u2014 SENATE S5738 May 20, 1999 Whereas, the Omnibus Budget Reconcili- ation Act of 1993 included a provision, \u00a713612 (a) (C), that discourages additional states from implementing such partnerships; and Whereas, this provision requires states to make recovery from the estates of persons who had enjoyed enhanced Medicaid asset protection, thereby making the asset protec-tion provided by the public/private partner-ships only temporary; and Whereas, the General Assembly, pursuant to Senate Joint Resolution No. 365 (1997), urged Congress to repeal \u00a713612 (a) (C) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993; and Whereas, the Governor has requested that Congress remove \u00a713612 (a) (C) and allow ad-ditional states to establish asset protection programs for individuals who purchase quali-fied long-term care insurance policies with-out requiring that states recover such assets upon a beneficiary's death; and Whereas, the removal of \u00a713612 (a) (C) would make such partnerships much more attractive to potential participants, espe-cially if they are motivated by a desire to pass some of their assets on to their chil-dren; and Whereas, having long-term care insurance reduces the possibility that individuals will spend down to Medicaid eligibility levels; and Whereas, long-term care insurance, by re- ducing the Medicaid expenditures for policy-holders, helps states control Medicaid costs; and Whereas, Congress has not yet acted to re- peal \u00a713612 (a) (C) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993; now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Senate the House of Dele- gates concurring, That the Congress of the United States be urged to establish a limited pilot program which exempts the Common-wealth of Virginia from the provisions of \u00a713612 (a) (C) of the Omnibus Budget Rec-onciliation Act of 1993 requiring states to make recovery from the estates of persons who had enjoyed enhanced Medicaid asset protection; and, be it Resolved Further, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit a copy of this resolution to the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the Congressional Delegation of Virginia in order that they may be apprised of the sense of the General Assembly of Virginia in this matter. POM-123. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of the State of Maine relative to the interstate truck weight limits; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. JOINT RESOLUTION We, your Memorialists, the Members of the One Hundred and Nineteenth Legislature of the State of Maine, now assembled in the First Regular Session, most respectfully present and petition the President of the United States and the United States Con-gress, as follows: Whereas, the issue of interstate truck weight limits is of great concern for a num-ber of reasons; and Whereas, economic development interests in northern and central Maine are increas-ingly frustrated at their loss of transpor-tation productivity due to the disparity in weight limits between the state highways and the Interstate Highway System; and Whereas, this disparity has resulted in the diversion of heavy through trucks from the Interstate Highway System to more con-gested State highways, raising safety con-cerns in the Legislature and in municipal groups. A fatal crash on Route 9 in Dixmont and a fuel truck crash in Augusta have fur- ther raised concern; and Whereas, an increase in the interstate gross vehicle weight limit for 6-axle com-bination vehicles, from 80,000 pounds to be-tween 90,000 and 95,000 pounds, is supported by an engineering review that was recently conducted by the Maine Department of Transportation; and Whereas, a recommendation to increase interstate weight limits is also supported by the Maine State Police, the Maine Depart-ment of Economic and Community Develop-ment, the Maine Turnpike Authority, the Maine Better Transportation Association, the Maine Chamber and Business Alliance and the Maine Motor Transportation Asso-ciation, now, therefore, be it Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, re- quest that the President of the United States and the United States Congress amend fed-eral law to increase the interstate gross ve-hicle weight limits for 6-axle combination vehicles to between 90,000 and 95,000 pounds and maintain the current freeze on longer combination vehicles; and be it further Resolved, That suitable copies of this reso- lution, duly authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to the Honorable William J. Clinton, President of the United States; the President of the United States Senate; the Speaker of the House of Rep-resentatives of the United States and each member of the Maine Congressional Delega-tion. f REPORTS OF COMMITTEES The following reports of committees were submitted: By Mr. M CCAIN, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, with an amendment in the nature of a sub-stitute: S. 303.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to waive the in-come inclusion on a distribution from an individual retirement account to the extent that the distribution is con-tributed for charitable purposes; to the Committee on Finance. IRA ROLLOVER TO CHARITY ACT Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce, along with Senator D URBIN , the IRA Rollover to Charity Act of 1999. This legislation has the support of numerous charitable organizations across the United States. The effect of this bill would be to unlock billions of dollars in savings Americans hold and make them avail-able to charity. Mr. President, the legislation will allow individuals to roll assets from an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) into a charity or a deferred charitable gift plan without incurring any income tax consequences. Thus, the donation would be made to charity without ever withdrawing it as income and paying tax on it. Americans hold well over $1 trillion in assets in IRAs. Nearly half of Amer-ica's families have IRAs. Recent stud-ies show that assets of qualified retire-ment plans comprise a substantial part of the net worth of many persons. Many individuals would like to give a portion of these assets to charity. Under current law, if an IRA is trans- ferred into a charitable remainder trust, donors are required to recognize all such income. Therefore, absent the changes called for in the legislation, the donor will have taxable income in the year the gift is funded. The IRA Rollover to Charity Act lifts the dis-incentives contained in our com-plicated and burdensome tax code and will unleash a critical source of fund-ing for our nation's charities. This is a common sense way to remove obstacles to private charitable giving. Under the legislation, upon reaching age 59 12, an individual could move as- sets penalty-free from an IRA directly to charity or into a qualifying deferred charitable gift plan\u2014e.g. charitable re-minder trusts, pooled income funds and gift annuities. In the latter case the donor would be able to receive an in-come stream from the retirement plan assets, which would be taxed according to normal rules. Upon the death of the individual, the remainder would be transferred to charity. Mr. President, I hope the Senate will join in this effort to provide a valuable new source of philanthropy for our na-tion's charities. This legislation has the support of numerous universities and charitable groups, including the Charitable Accord, an umbrella organi-zation representing more than 1,000 or-ganizations and associations. Mr. President, I have just returned from the Balkans. I have seen first hand the wonderful work that is being done by charitable groups in dealing with the massive refugee crisis that has occurred there. As terrible as this crisis has been, it would be worse if not for the great work that is being done by charitable groups. Our bill will help direct additional resources to those charities and thousands of others. I urge my colleagues to co-sponsor this legislation. By Mr. KYL: S. 1088. A bill to authorize the Sec- retary of Agriculture to convey certain administrative sites in national forests in the State of Arizona, to convey cer-tain land to the City of Sedona, Ari- zona for a wastewater treatment facil-ity, and for other purposes; to the Com-mittee on Energy and Natural Re-sources. THE ARIZONA NATIONAL FOREST IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1999 Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the U.S. Forest Service is interested in ex-changing or selling six unmanageable, undesirable and/or excess parcels of land in the Prescott, Tonto, Kaibab and Coconino National Forests. In ad-dition, the Forest Service has agreed to sell land to the City of Sedona for use as an effluent disposal system. If the parcels are sold, the Forest Service wants to use the proceeds from five of these sales to either fund new con-struction or upgrade current adminis-trative facilities at these national for-ests. Funds generated from the sale of the other parcels could be used to fund acquisition of sites, or construction of administrative facilities at any na-tional forest in Arizona. Transfers of land completed under this bill will be done in accordance with all other ap-plicable laws, including environmental laws. Mr. President, this bill will enhance customer and administrative services by allowing the Forest Service to con-solidate and update facilities and/or re-locate facilities to more convenient lo-cations. It offers a simple and common- sense way to enhance services for na-tional forest users in Arizona, and to facilitate the disposal of unmanage-able, undesirable and/or excess parcels of national forest lands. This bill will also facilitate the construction of a much needed wastewater treatment plant for the City of Sedona. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent that the bill be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: S. 1088 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1.

By Ms. SNOW (for herself, Mr. MCCAIN, Mr. H OLLINGS , Mr. KERRY , Mr. B REAUX , and Mr. INOUYE ): S. 1089. A bill to authorize appropria- tions for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 for the United States Coast Guard, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transpor-tation. THE COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1999 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1999. The Coast Guard provides many crit- ical services for our nation. Dedicated Coast Guard personnel save an average of more than 5,000 lives, $2.5 billion in property, and assist more than 100,000 other mariners in distress. Through boater safety programs and mainte-nance of an extensive network of aids to navigation, the Coast Guard pro-tects thousands of additional people engaged in coastwise trade, commer-cial fishing activities, or simply enjoy-ing a day of recreation out on our bays, oceans, and waterways. The Coast Guard enforces all federal laws and treaties related to the high seas and U.S. waters. This includes ma-rine resource protection and pollution control. As one of the five armed forces, it provides a critical component of the nation's defense strategy, some-thing weighing heavily on all of our minds lately. Last year, Congress enacted the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1998, which authorized the Coast Guard through Fiscal Year 1999. The bill I am introducing today reauthorizes the Coast Guard for the next two years\u2014 Fiscal Years 2000 and 2001. It authorizes both appropriations and personnel levels for these two years. It also contains various provisions that are designed to provide greater flexi-bility to the Coast Guard on personnel administration; strengthen marine safety provisions; includes sufficient funding to allow for a 4.4 percent pay raise; and other provisions. One provision that deserves par- ticular mention relates to icebreaking services. The President's FY 2000 budg-et request includes a proposal to decomission 11 WYTL-class harbor tugs. These tugs provide vital icebreaking services throughout the northern states, including my home state of Maine. While I understand that the age of this vessel class may require some action by the agency, I feel it would be premature to decommission these vessels before the Coast Guard has identified a means to rectify any potentially harmful degradation of services. The Coast Guard has identi-fied seven waterways within Maine that would suffer a meaningful deg-radation of service should these tugs be brought offline now. These waterways provide necessary transport routes for oil tankers, commercial fishing vessels, and cargo ships. The costs would be ex-cessive to the local communities should that means of transport be cut off. As such, the bill I am introducing today includes a measure that would require the Coast Guard to submit a re-port to Congress before removing these tugs from service that will include an analysis of the use of this class of har-bor tugs to perform icebreaking serv-ices; the degree to which the decom-missioning of each such vessel would result in a degradation of current serv-ices; and recommendations to reme-diate such degradation. As part of its law enforcement mis- sion in 1998, the Coast Guard seized 75 vessels transporting more than 100,000 pounds of illegal narcotics headed for our shores. This bill provides funding to maintain many of the new drug interdiction initiatives of the past few years. The Coast Guard has proven time and again its ability to stem the tide of drugs entering our nation through water routes. Finally, the Coast Guard is the lead federal agency for preventing and re-sponding to major pollution incidents in the coastal zone. It responds to more than 17,000 pollution incidents in the average year. This bill includes a pro-vision that provides the Coast Guard with emergency borrowing authority from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. The measure would enhance the VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, SENATE S5741 May 20, 1999 Coast Guard's ability to effectively re- spond to major oil spills. Mr. President, this is a good bill that enjoys bipartisan support on the Com-merce Committee. I look forward to moving this bill to the Senate floor at the earliest opportunity. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent that the text of the bill be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: S. 1089 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1.

Mr. M CCAIN. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1999. I would like to commend Senator S NOWE , the Chair of the Commerce Subcommittee on Oceans and Fish-eries, for her leadership on Coast Guard issues. Earlier in the year, Senator S NOWE convened a hearing on the Coast Guard's fiscal year 2000 budget request. The Commandant of the Coast Guard testified at the hearing and explained the priorities and challenges that the Coast Guard will face in the coming years and the ways that the agency will handle them. The Coast Guard is a branch of the armed forces and a multi-mission agen-cy. The Coast Guard is responsible for our national defense, search and rescue services on our nation's waterways, maritime law enforcement, including drug interdiction and environmental protection, marine inspection, licens-ing, port safety and security, aids to navigation, waterways management, and boating safety. This bill will fur-nish the Coast Guard with funding au-thority to continue to provide the United States with high quality per-formance of its diverse duties through fiscal year 2001. I commend the men and women of the Coast Guard who serve their country with honor and dis-tinction. I believe the bill that we have intro- duced today is an important first step in providing authorizing legislation for the Coast Guard for fiscal years 2000- 2001. The funding levels are currently based on the Administration's trans-mitted legislative proposal. However, I am particularly concerned about the Coast Guard's ability to continue to fight the war on drugs. The vast major-ity of drugs enter our country illegally after being transported over our water-ways. As the primary maritime law en-forcement agency, the Coast Guard has proven that it can effectively stop drugs from reaching our streets. In fis-cal year 1998, the Coast Guard seized 82,623 pounds of cocaine and 31,365 pounds of marijuana. Campaign STEEL WEB, the comprehensive, multi-year strategy to fight the war on drugs de-serves full support and funding from both the Administration and the Con-gress. Before the Commerce Committee concludes its consideration of this bill, I intend to determine whether the Ad-ministration's bill will provide an ade-quate level of funding for the Coast Guard's drug interdiction activities. I will also seek to ensure that funding is spent on the most effective drug inter-diction programs. The bill also incorporates several non-controversial provisions included in the Administration's bill which would provide for a variety of improve-ments for the day-to-day operation of the Coast Guard. I look forward to working with Senator S NOWE and other members of the Commerce Committee during the Senate's consideration of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1999. By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire, and Mr. L OTT): S. 1090. A bill to reauthorize and amend the Comprehensive Environ-mental Response, Liability, and Com-pensation Act of 1980; to the Com-mittee on Environment and Public Works. THE SUPERFUND PROGRAM COMPLETION ACT OF 1999 Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Superfund Pro-gram Completion Act of 1999. This bill represents our efforts to focus on the areas where bipartisan consensus is achievable this year. The bill provides liability relief for many parties trapped in Superfund\u2014in fact, it ex-empts or limits the liability of the vast bulk of all parties involved in Super-fund litigation. The bill includes very strong provisions to facilitate the rede-velopment of Brownfields, and it starts to wind down the Federal role in site cleanup, while enhancing the role of the states. The bill includes many provisions that have enjoyed widespread bipar-tisan support in the Senate. The Brownfields title will provide $100 mil-lion in grants for state, tribal and local governments to identify, assess and re-develop Brownfields sites. It protects prospective purchasers of contami-nated sites, innocent owners of prop-erties adjacent to the source of con-tamination, and innocent property owners who exercised due diligence upon purchase. These provisions have been included in past bills supported by Democrats and Republicans over the last six years. The bill exempts a number of parties from Superfund liability and incor-porates provisions of S. 2180, the Super-fund Recycling Equity Act of 1998, co- sponsored last year by Senators L OTT and D ASCHLE , as well as 64 other mem- bers of the Senate. Our bill exempts small businesses, contributors of very small amounts of hazardous waste, and contributors of small amounts of mu-nicipal solid waste. The bill limits the liability of larger generators or trans-porters of municipal solid waste, as well as owners or operators of co-dis-posal landfills where municipal solid waste is disposed. The bill limits the li-ability of so-called de minimis par-ties\u2014generally one percent contribu-tors or less\u2014as well as municipalities and small businesses with a limited ability to pay. It is well known that Superfund li- ability\u2014retroactive, strict, joint and several liability\u2014often can be terribly unfair. It does not make any sense to make Superfund liability even more unfair to the parties who do not receive liability relief in this bill by merely shifting the share of the exempt or lim-ited parties onto those that remain lia-ble. This bill does not do that. Instead, where we grant liability relief, we di-rect EPA to use the taxes already col-lected from industry to pay the cost of the exemptions. This seems only fair. The bill also requires EPA to perform an impartial fair-share allocation at Superfund NPL sites and to give all parties an opportunity to settle for their allocated amount. In performing the allocation, EPA is directed to use the factors first proposed by Vice President G OREwhen he was serving in the House. EPA is given discretion to design the process, and parties that do not participate or settle remain liable to Superfund's underlying liability pro-visions, which remain unchanged ex-cept for those fortunate parties pro-vided the new protections noted above. As EPA proudly boasts, cleanup is complete or underway at over 90 per-cent of the sites on the current NPL. While it is cleaning up the sites at a rate of 85 per year, it has listed only an average of about 26 per year. Last year, the General Accounting Office sur-veyed the states and EPA about the ap-proximately 3,000 sites identified as VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5743 May 20, 1999 possible National Priority List sites, but not yet listed. Only 232 of these sites were identified by either EPA, a state, or both, as likely to be listed on the NPL. Clearly, this program is much closer to the end than in the beginning. This bill requires EPA to plan how it will proceed at those 3,000 sites still awaiting a decision regarding listing. Everyone knows that the vast bulk of these sites will not be listed on the Superfund List, they will be cleaned up by the states, as the GAO report con-firms. Under our bill, new listings on the National Priority List must be re-quested by the Governor of the affected state, and EPA is limited to listing 30 sites per year. The bill provides finality at sites cleaned up in state cleanup programs unless a state asks for help, fails to take action, or a true emergency is present. This will give greater con-fidence to prospective developers that state cleanup decisions will not be sec-ond-guessed by EPA. The bill strength-ens state programs and starts to bring Superfund to an end. The bill makes EPA's authorization and appropriation process more trans-parent. There are separate line items for EPA's cleanup program\u2014the heart of the program\u2014and all other activi-ties such as Brownfields, support for research and development, Department of Justice enforcement, et cetera. No longer will increases in popular pro-grams such as Brownfields come at the expense of the cleanup program. Au-thorization levels for the cleanup rec-ognize that the program's workload is decreasing and will ramp down over time. The bill allows the program to be funded from either general revenues or the Trust Fund. It is my view that the Superfund taxes should not be reim-posed, and I will strongly oppose their reimposition absent comprehensive Superfund reform that includes needed improvements to provisions governing natural resource damages, liability, and the cleanup process. To the extent that EPA improves its cost recovery performance and the Trust Fund bal-ance exceeds levels needed to fund the liability relief provided in this bill, then that balance, instead of general revenues, can be used for Superfund cleanup. It is possible that EPA can recover enough past cleanup expenditures to pay for the full 5-year reauthorization program. Since the program's incep-tion, EPA has spent approximately $15.9 billion on cleanup, the vast major-ity of it from industry-paid Superfund taxes deposited in the Trust Fund. Un-fortunately, EPA has only recovered $2.4 billion of this total. Even dis-counting nearly $6.9 billion in expendi-tures that have been written-off by EPA or are no longer considered recov-erable, there is approximately $6.6 bil-lion that EPA could recover for the Trust Fund. It is well known that Senator S MITH and I have long advocated comprehen-sive reform of the Superfund program. We have not abandoned that goal. How-ever, in many ways, the bill we intro-duce today is more far-reaching than our efforts in the last two Congresses. Except for the liability provisions de-scribed above, the major focus of this bill is how to address sites not yet in the federal Superfund program. The Superfund Program Completion Act ad-dresses the future of the Superfund program. The major reforms included in our previous efforts are not a part of the new bill. This bill does not address li-ability for damages to natural re-sources. The bill does not include li-ability relief for large responsible par-ties, such as federal funding of the fair shares attributed to bankrupt, defunct and insolvent parties. The bill does not make changes to Superfund's provi-sions regarding the conduct of clean-ups. I still believe reforms are needed for natural resource damages, liability for large responsible parties, and the cleanup process. Unfortunately, the ad-ministration no longer supports legis-lative reform in these areas. Even in previous years, when the administra-tion claimed to support such reforms, agreement was not possible. Given the remote prospects for concurrence on these issues, Senator S MITH and I de- cided to set the issues aside for now and move forward with an agenda that we believe can generate bipartisan sup-port. I cannot understand why anyone would fail to support this bill. It will accelerate Brownfields redevelopment. It will strengthen state programs in anticipation of the day we all know is coming\u2014the day when the Superfund program becomes the small emergency program that was originally intended. It limits or eliminates the liability of many parties who were caught in Su-perfund's incredibly broad liability net, and it does so in a manner that is fair to those that are left. It does not un-dermine the so-called ''polluter pays'' principle, but in fact strengthens it by creating an incentive for EPA to im-prove its cost recovery performance. The committee will move forward quickly on this bill. The committee will hold hearings on the bill next week. We will work through the Memo-rial Day recess to address Members' concerns, then hold a markup within 10 days of returning from the recess. The bill will be ready for floor action prior to the July Fourth recess. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent that the text of the bill be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: S. 1090 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I am pleased to join the distinguished chair-man of the Committee on Environment and Public Works in introducing the Superfund Program Completion Act of 1999. This is a good day for the environ-ment and for the American taxpayer, because this bill addresses many of the problems in Superfund that have wast-ed resources and delayed the cleanup of hazardous waste sites across the coun-try. Since I became chairman of the Superfund, Waste Control and Risk As-sessment Subcommittee in 1995, I have had one overriding goal with respect to Superfund reform: To increase cleanups by decreasing the unfairness of the law. By now, most are well aware of Su- perfund's dismal history. The program was created in 1980 to clean up aban-doned hazardous waste sites. Begun with the best of intentions, Superfund has failed to meet even minimal expec-tations. Despite public and private ex-penditures of more than $40 billion dol-lars, less than 14% of approximately 1,300 sites have been cleaned up and re-moved from the National Priorities List over the last nineteen years. The primary reason for this abysmal performance is Superfund's retro-active, strict, joint and several liabil-ity scheme. Under joint and several li-ability, the EPA or a private party can seek to hold any other potentially re-sponsible party liable for the entire cleanup cost at a site\u2014regardless of the type of contamination, when the material was disposed of, or whether the activity was legal at the time. Joint and several liability allows the government or a larger polluter to le-gally extort payments far in excess of a company's true share of responsibility for waste at a site. Most reasonable people would agree that such a liability scheme is simply unfair. Worse yet, this unfairness has significantly hindered progress in cleaning up sites and wasted vast amounts of taxpayer funding. As one might expect, when a company is faced with paying 100% of the costs at a site for which their true liability may be less than 10%, that company will delay, negotiate, and litigate at every stop of the process. That, unfortunately, is the well-documented history of Superfund. It is important to recognize that this unfairness is not confined to EPA's en-forcement of the law. EPA merely be-gins the process at most sites by tar-geting one or more large parties who are potentially responsible for cleanup. Then those parties typically turn around and sue tens or hundreds of other parties\u2014average citizens, small businesses, schools, churches, and oth-ers who face huge legal bills and years of expensive litigation if they don't pay up. My position on this issue has been constant: I believe that retroactive, strict, joint and several liability is fun-damentally unfair. If I had my way, I would repeal it today. Some of my col-leagues see things differently, however, and the bill we introduce today rep-resents a reasonable resolution of con-flicting views on that topic. While our legislation does not go as far as many would like, I believe it goes as far as we can if we are inter-ested in passing a bill this Administra-tion will sign into law. There's an old saying around here: ''Don't let the per-fect be the enemy of the good.'' That is certainly the case with Superfund and the legislation we introduce today. This is a good bill. It will make a pro-found and positive difference in the lives of millions of Americans. It is a bill that can pass the Senate on a strong bi-partisan basis; and it is a bill that the President should sign into law. The Superfund Program Completion Act makes major reforms in six areas. Specifically, the SPCA: Directs EPA to finish the job that was started nearly two decades ago by completing the evaluation of the 3,000 remaining sites on the CERCLA Infor-mation System (CERCLIS). Clearly allocates responsibility be- tween states and EPA for future clean-ups. Protects municipalities, small busi- ness, recyclers, and other parties from unfair liability\u2014while making the sys-tem fairer for everyone else. Provides states $100 million per year and full authority for their own clean-up programs. Revitalizes communities with $100 million in annual brownfields redevel-opment grants. Requires fiscal responsibility by EPA and saves taxpayers money. Our legislation will result in more hazardous waste sites being cleaned up\u2014and in fewer dollars being wasted on litigation. It will give much-needed and much-deserved liability relief to innocent landowners, contiguous prop-erty owners, prospective purchasers, municipalities, small businesses and recyclers. Unlike EPA's administrative reforms, this bill does not shift costs from politically popular parties to those left holding the bag. Instead, it requires payment of a statutory orphan share and authorizes the use of the Superfund Trust Fund for those shares. For those left trapped in the Super- fund liability scheme, the SPCA re-quires an allocation process to deter-mine a party's fair share in an expe-dited settlement\u2014instead of fighting it out for years in court. In addition to increasing fairness, the SPCA provides much needed guidance and direction to a sometimes wayward EPA. It recognizes and builds upon the growth and strength of State hazardous waste cleanup programs. It provides new resources to States and localities for their cleanup and redevelopment ef-forts. As many of my colleagues know, the fear of Superfund liability has re-sulted in an estimated 450,000 aban-doned or underutilized properties, or ''Brownfields,'' that lay fallow because private developers and municipalities don't want to be dragged into Super-fund's litigation quagmire. With new resources and appropriate liability pro-tections, our bill will allow the cleanup of those sites, spurring economic rede-velopment in cities, towns, and rural areas across America. We take a different approach to the brownfields redevelopment issue than VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov \u2014 SENATE S5754 May 20, 1999 the Administration seeks. Along with many of my colleagues, I believe that economic redevelopment is primarily a State and local issue. Our approach provides the resources and freedom States need to make progress on this front, rather than giving EPA new au-thority to get into the commercial real estate and redevelopment business. That is not EPA's role, nor should it be. Where EPA does have a role is in identifying and addressing risks at un-controlled hazardous waste sites. Our legislation ensures that EPA regains its focus on that mission. Earlier this year, the General Ac- counting Office (GAO) reported that ''completion of construction at exist-ing sites'' and reducing new entries into the program was the Environ-mental Protection Agency's top Super-fund priority. Unfortunately, EPA's narrow focus on generating construc-tion completion statistics appears to have diverted resources from EPA's fundamental mission\u2014protecting human health and the environment from releases of hazardous waste. GAO reported last year that there are still 3,000 sites awaiting a National Pri-orities List decision by EPA, most of which have been in the CERCLIS in-ventory for more than a decade. Ac-cording to the report, however, more than 1,200 of those sites are actually in-eligible for listing on the NPL, for a variety of reasons. Some of the sites were classified erroneously, while oth-ers either do not require cleanup, have already been cleaned up, or have final cleanup underway. EPA's failure to re-move the specter of an NPL listing at these sites has likely caused signifi-cant economic and social harm to the surrounding communities. EPA needs to focus on that task. In addition, far too many of the sites that are still potentially eligible for listing have received little or no atten-tion from EPA. EPA admitted taking no cleanup action at all at 336 sites and provided no information for another 48 sites. The only action taken at 719 sites was an initial site assessment. EPA's inattention may be due to the fact that EPA and state officials together identi-fied only 232 of the sites as worthy of being added to the NPL. In that case, however, the appropriate response is to archive the sites while ensuring that any necessary cleanup occurs under some other Federal or state program. EPA needs to focus on that task as well. Unforfunately, there is also disagree- ment between EPA and state officials about even those 232 sites. EPA identi-fied 132 that may be listed on the NPL in the future, but state officials agreed on only 26 of those. Conversely, state officials identified a different group of 100 sites as worthy of an NPL listing in the future. EPA agreed with GAO's recommenda- tion that it ''develop a joint strategy'' with the States for addressing these sites. After nearly 20 years and $20 bil-lion in taxpayer funded EPA appropria-tions, it is disturbing that the agency only now is developing such a strategy. Nonetheless, Congress has an obliga-tion to provide direction and assistance to EPA in this effort. The Superfund Program Completion Act provides that direction by: Requiring EPA to finish evaluating and/or archiving old sites stuck in the CERCLIS inventory, correcting the current imbalance between evaluating uncontrolled sites and amassing con-struction completed statistics. Providing EPA with a schedule of 30 NPL listings per year, to ensure that it and the States appropriately allocate sites for cleanup under Superfund, RCRA, or State response programs. Increasing current law limits on EPA removal actions to provide greater flexibility in responding to sites that at least initially should be the respon-sibility of the Federal government, but ultimately do not require an NPL list-ing. These provisions will ensure that the limited universe of sites remaining in the Superfund pipeline are dealt with quickly and safely. In addition to keeping EPA focused on the task at hand, our bill provides increased resources and authority to the States, in recognition of the progress made by State cleanup pro-grams in the last decade. Superfund is notable among the major Federal environmental statutes not only for its abysmal track record, but also for its heavy reliance on EPA action rather than state implementa-tion. In other environmental pro-grams\u2014RCRA, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act\u2014EPA typically sets general program direc-tion and provides technical support while leaving implementation and en-forcement to the states. In the Super-fund program, however, EPA takes a direct role in both enforcement and cleanup. This leadership role was origi-nally justified by a perceived inability or alleged unwillingness on the part of states to perform or oversee cleanups. The situation today is far different. The Environmental Law Institute re- ported last year that States have now completed 41,000 cleanups, with an-other 13,700 in progress. The Associa-tion of State and Territorial Solid Waste Management Officials (ASTSWMO) reports that ''States are not only addressing more sites at any given time, but are also completing more sites through streamlined State programs. State programs have ma-tured and increased in their infrastruc- ture capacity.'' Most now recognize that states have made great strides in their programs, and even EPA in May of 1998 released a ''Plan to Enhance the Role of States and Tribes in the Superfund Program.'' Not surprisingly, while that plan ap-pears to provide some increased oppor-tunities for state leadership, it also en-visions a significant, on-going role for EPA. The Superfund Program Completion Act, on the other hand, assists, recog-nizes and builds on the growth of state cleanup programs. The SPCA also re-sponds to pleas from ASTSWMO, the National Governors Association and others to remove the ever-present threat of EPA over-filing and third party lawsuits under Superfund when a site is being cleaned up under a State program. The SPCA recognizes the fact that States should be the leaders in cleaning up hazardous waste sites by: Providing $100 million annually for State core and voluntary response pro-grams to allow States to build on their impressive record of accomplishment in this area. Providing finality, except in cases of emergency or at a State's request, for cleanups conducted under State law. Requiring EPA to work with the States so that sites listed on the NPL are those the Governor of the State agrees warrant an NPL listing. Mr. President, the legislation we in- troduce today represents the culmina-tion of years of hard work. In the four years I have been Chairman of the Superfund Subcommittee, we have heard from more than 100 witnesses, representing every viewpoint, in an ef-fort to grapple with the problems caused by the Superfund law. We have communicated with thousands of indi-viduals and organizations who have urged us to fix this law. Senator C HAFEE and I have spent long hours with our Democratic col-leagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee, and with EPA Ad-ministrator Carol Browner. So far, we and our staffs have devoted more than 600 hours to this effort. We have nego-tiated issues, identified areas of agree-ment, eliminated many areas of con-troversy, and pinpointed those few re-maining areas where our differences will need to be resolved through the legislative process itself. I look for-ward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle during that proc-ess. Before I close, let me say a few words about taxes. Simply put, there are no taxes required to finance this bill, and I will oppose all attempts to attach them to it. Congress has appropriated more than $20 billion to support EPA's Superfund program during the past 19 years. The GAO reports that amount includes more than $6 billion of unrecovered ''recoverable costs.'' ''Recoverable costs'' are taxpayer expenditures that EPA made in anticipation of recov-ering them from individual polluters at sites. That sum alone would be suffi-cient to finance EPA's cleanup efforts throughout the life of this reauthoriza-tion. Our bill allows those funds to be used for cleanup when EPA does re-cover them. Further, there should be no doubt that Congress will continue to appropriate funds needed for EPA to finish its job. More taxes are not re-quired to finance this bill or to finish the Superfund program. During the last two Congresses, I was willing to support the reimposition of VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov \u2014 SENATE S5755 May 20, 1999 taxes to finance Superfund legislation with major changes in the areas of remedy selection and natural resource damages\u2014as well as more sweeping li-ability reforms than are contained in the bill we introduce today. There re-mains a real need for those reforms, and I pledge to continue my efforts in that regard. The bill we introduce today, however, is designed to achieve all that we can under the current Administration. It represents substantial, real reform that will help thousands of commu-nities and millions of Americans. I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join my colleagues Senator B OBSMITH and Senator. J OHN CHAFEE in introducing the Superfund Program Completion Act. For several years Con-gress has worked diligently to find common ground for all parties in-volved, common ground that will also correct the flaws of the original law. Senator S MITH's legislation will do just that. In 1980, Congress approved the Com- prehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) which was intended to pay for the cleanup of the nation's most hazardous waste sites. This law became known as Superfund\u2014a bit ironic since the law provides no funding, but in-stead requires those who operated or used the landfill to pay for the cleanup. There is logic and fairness in requir- ing the polluters to pay for the clean-up; however, Superfund's liability structure was so poorly planned exces-sive litigation was encouraged. Cleanup did not occur and costs were passed to small businesses across the nation. Superfund did cause unnecessary law-suits and wasted valuable time, all the while leaving sites across America pol-luted. Mr. President, this new legislation by Senators S MITH and C HAFEE would ex- empt those small businesses who acted in good faith and are still being dragged into Superfund as third and fourth party defendants by simply throwing out their household trash. Superfund does not distinguish large from small, nor does it distinguish pol-luters from responsible businesses. In many instances, these business owners did nothing wrong. Yet, the law penal-izes people for something that at one time was legal. Virtually all sides agree that some small businesses should have never been pulled into the system. While this legislation would not be retroactive, it will save small businesses in other communities from future Superfund lawsuits. It is important to reward those who have acted responsibly. I be-lieve Senator S MITH's bill is respon- sible. Mr. President, I do not believe there is one Senator who is pleased with the way in which the Superfund statute has operated. Like small businesses, re-cyclers have also been targeted to pay for cleanup. They should not be held responsible for pollution at a Super- fund site. The Administration agrees. A majority of the Congress agrees. The environmental community agrees. Sen-ator S MITH's bill will fix the recycler's problem and remain faithful to the en-vironment. Over the past three decades, concern for our environment and natural re-sources has grown\u2014as has the desire to recycle and reuse. This makes environ-mental sense. This legislation would remove an unintended yet troublesome legal obstacle to recycling. This bill corrects current law and encourages re-cycling. It simply recognizes that recy-cling is not disposal and that recyclables are not waste. Common sense tells us that recycling something is not the same as disposing of it. This bill will help level the playing field between the use of recycled goods and competitive virgin raw materials. Currently suppliers of virgin raw mate-rials face no Superfund liability for contamination caused by the con-sumer. This bill will supply the same waiver to those who sell recyclable ma-terials. This bill also contains protections to ensure that sham recyclers are unable to benefit from this exemption. In order for recyclers to be relieved of Superfund liability, they must act in an environmentally sound manner and sell their product to manufacturers with environmentally responsible busi-ness practices. Considering that most recyclers are currently operating in a reasonable and conscience manner, this should be an easy test. Mr. President, the recycling portion of the bill is the product of lengthy ne-gotiations between the federal and state governments, the environmental community and the recycling industry. It serves only one purpose\u2014to remove from the liability loop those who col-lect and ship recyclables to a third party site. These negotiations have re-sulted in a provision that I believe to be both environmentally and fiscally sound. By removing the threat of Superfund liability for recyclers, we will encourage more recycling. Mr. President, while this provision is not precisely the Superfund Recycling Equity Act which Senator D ASCHLE and I introduced last year\u2014a bill which was supported by 63 of our Senate col-leagues\u2014I look forward to working with all parties to ensure we pass a bill that the Administration, environ-mentalists, and industry can support. Mr. President, I will also work with my colleagues to ensure that no Super-fund taxes will be reinstated. After many years and millions and millions of dollars spent by the government, large businesses, municipalities, schools, and small businesses, only a fraction of the costs has been devoted to cleanup. This cannot continue to happen. I have seen a copy of the May 14, 1999, letter from Senators C HAFEE and S MITH to the Environmental Protection Agen-cy, and I completely agree with its con-clusions. There is no need for addi- tional tax revenue. I want to quote from their letter because the Senators said it just right. ''Many responsible parties who have already paid for their own cleanups would also be liable for reimposed taxes. They are frankly unwilling to see the tax reinstated unless there are sweeping reforms in the structure of the program, as well. We find their ar-guments persuasive. We will not vote to reimpose the tax, unless it is part of a comprehensive Superfund reform.'' ''There is a second reason for our op- position to a tax extension at this time. As we noted in a recent letter to Administrator Browner, Congress has appropriated $15.9 billion for Superfund from its inception through 1988. The Superfund Trust Fund was created to facilitate rapid cleanups carried out by the federal government's expenditures would be recovered from responsible parties once the cleanup action was complete. This is real ''polluters pay'' principle.'' ''However, only a small percentage of the $15.9 billion has been recovered. To date, the Agency has obtained commit-ments to recover $2.4 billion. EPA has written off $5 billion of past expendi-tures and GAO reports that another $1.9 billion is likely unrecoverable be-cause EPA did not properly calculate its indirect costs. This is a troubling record. A good cost recovery program that actually made the real polluters (as opposed to the taxpaying indus-tries) pay could have recovered suffi-cient funds to carry Superfund through another authorization cycle without the reimposition of taxes. We are reluc-tant to ask Superfund taxpayers to once again prop up a Trust Fund that EPA has allowed to dwindle.'' Mr. President, I'm very impressed with the Chairman C HAFEE and Chair- man S MITH have done in getting this bill drafted and introduced. They are also working on a second major envi-ronmental bill in the waste area\u2014 RCRA. Last year we jointly requested a report from the GAO on what saving and efficiencies can be achieved with rifle shot fixes. This year Senators C HAFEE and S MITH have been diligently working on finalizing a legislative ap-proach that is compatible to this GAO study. I know their staffs have been consulting with all the stakeholders, and I look forward to seeing this bill this summer. Hopefully, both bills will have a chance to advance through the legislative process so that the full Sen-ate can consider them. Both ap-proaches are reforms that Americans deserve and need. As environmentalists talk about laws which protect the environment, Con-gress must determine who actually bears the burden of cost, and determine the balance. Superfund does not dis-criminate. The way Superfund is being implemented, it attacks our neighbors, our schools, and even our corner gro-cers. The Superfund Program Comple-tion Act makes positive strides toward VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5756 May 20, 1999 correcting the balance and reflects so- ciety's progress from the 80's and in-corporates the methods of the 90's. By Mr. D EWINE (for himself, Mr. KENNEDY , and Mr. B OND): S. 1091. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for the establishment of a pediatric research initiative; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. THE PEDIATRIC RESEARCH INITIATIVE ACT OF 1999 Mr. D EWINE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation that will increase our nation's investment in pe-diatric research. Despite the medical breakthroughs that have been made by health re-searchers in recent years, it is obvious that health care research is under funded. I have joined with many sen-ators to express support for doubling the budget at HIH for biomedical re-search. I will continue to fight for this increased funding so that NIH can ex-pand its research efforts. An increase in funding is especially needed to im-prove our knowledge about illnesses and conditions affecting children. Children under age 12 represent 30 percent of the population\u2014and yet, NIH devotes less than 12 percent of its budget to their needs. There has been a growing consensus that children's health deserves more attention from the research community. The bill I am introducing today would help us begin to remedy the need for stronger investment in children's health research. I thank Senator B OND for joining with me in sponsoring this important legislation. This bill would authorize the Pediatric Research Ini-tiative within the Office of the Direc-tor of National Institutes of Health (NIH) to encourage, coordinate, sup-port, develop, and recognize pediatric research. The bill would authorize $50 million annually for the next three years. Dur-ing the last three years, I worked with my colleagues to fund this important Initiative and as a result, it received $5 million in fiscal year (FY) 1997, $38.5 million in FY 1998, and at least $38.5 million in FY 1999. I look forward to working with my colleagues again to continue on the path toward reaching the necessary funding level. Under this bill, the Initiative would provide $45 million over the next three years to encourage new initiatives and promising areas of pediatric research. It would also promote greater coordi-nation in children's health research. Today, there are some 20 Institutes and Centers and Offices within NIH that do something in the way of pediatrics. In my view, we need to bring some level of coordination and focus to these efforts. In developing this Initiative, I have made sure that it would give the Direc-tor of NIH as much discretion as pos-sible. The money has to be spent on outside research, so that the dollars flow out to the private sector\u2014but it can go toward basic research or clinical research. This bill does not create any new Of- fice, Center, or Institute. I would sim-ply authorize funding for more re-search and better research coordina-tion for children\u2014not infrastructure. In addition to authorizing the Initia- tive, the legislation would authorize new funding, through the National In-stitutes of Child Health and Human De-velopment (NICHD), for pediatric re-search training grants to provide a major increase in support for training additional pediatric research sci-entists. We need to strengthen our na-tional investment in pediatric research training. The supply of pediatrician scientists needs to increase if we are to fulfill the new NIH policies that require the par-ticipation of children in NIH-funded clinical trials and the new Food and Drug Administration (FDA) policies that require the testing of drugs for use by children before they can receive FDA approval. The number of pediatricians training to become subspecialists\u2014the potential supply of future pediatrician sci-entists\u2014is declining. The number of medical school pediatric departments that receive significant NIH research training grant support is limited\u2014 fewer than half receive any NIH re-search training grants. Many pediatri-cians in training have little or no expo-sure to research. Together, the Pediatric Research Ini- tiative and the pediatric research training grants are crucial investments in our country's future\u2014and will produce great returns. If we focus on improving health care for our children, we'll set the stage for them becoming healthy adults. This important legislation has the support of the pediatric research com-munity in children's hopsitals and uni-versity pediatric departments all over the country, including the National As-sociation of Children's Hospitals, Asso-ciation of Medical School Pediatric De-partment Chairmen, American Pedi-atric Society, and Society for Pediatric Research, as well as the Juvenile Dia-betes Foundation International, March of Dimes, Association of Ohio Chil-dren's Hospitals, and many more I urge my colleagues to support this investment in our children and cospon-sor this bill. I ask unanimous consent that the text of my legislation be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: S. 1091 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ''Pediatric Research Initiative Act of 1999''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds that\u2014 (1) innovations in health care, deriving from scientific investigation of the highest quality, offer substantial benefits to the well-being of children and savings in health care costs; (2) findings in pediatric research not only promote and maintain health throughout a child's lifespan, but also contribute signifi-cantly to new insights and discoveries that will aid in the prevention and treatment of illnesses and conditions among adults; (3) the rapidly expanding knowledge base in biology and medicine is offering greater opportunities than ever for pediatric physi-cian-scientists and basic researchers to har-ness this knowledge to the benefit of chil-dren and society; (4) the relatively smaller number of chil- dren compared as to adults and the relative rarity of many of their diseases and condi-tions has resulted in comparatively fewer re-sources being devoted to pediatric research and a lesser focus on children's needs; (5) substantially more of the support for children's health research is provided through the Federal Government than is the case for adults because of these market forces; (6) a new commitment to invest in chil- dren's research today will make a real dif-ference for children tomorrow; (7) the commitment to invest in children's research should include not only added in-vestment that is devoted to pediatric re-search but should also focus on ensuring the existence of a future supply of pediatric phy-sician-scientists; (8) the supply of pediatric physician-sci- entists is threatened by market demands which provide little room for support for re-search training for new pediatric physician- scientists; (9) over 60 percent of the pediatric depart- ments in the United States have no National Institutes of Health training grant support; and (10) improvements in the level of training grant support is essential to ensuring the ex-istence of future generations of pediatric clinical investigators who are responsible for moving research discoveries from the labora-tories to the patients, and who are therefore critical to clinical research.

BY MR. CRAPO: S. 1092. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with re-spect to regulation of pharmacists, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-sions. PHARMACIST 'S PATIENT PROTECTION ACT OF 1999 Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the ''Pharmacist's Patient Protection Act of 1999.'' The purpose of the legislation is to stop the implementation of final regulations that have been issued by the Food and Drug Administration that will require community pharmacists to provide agency sanctioned information when certain prescription drugs are dis-pensed to a patient. Such regulations, commonly called ''MedGuides'', were issued in final form on December 1, 1998. Now why would Congress want to prohibit a regulation which would give patients written information about their medications? The answer is very simple. During the 104th Congress, the House and Senate debated this very same issue, and ultimately a com- promise was reached whereby FDA agreed not to promulgate its MedGuide regulations for a period of time so that the private sector would have the op-portunity to work with the Adminis-tration to develop a voluntary action plan to continue to increase the qual-ity and quantity of written informa-tion already being provided to con-sumers with prescription medication. Under the agreement which was en-acted into law as part of the FY 97 Ag-riculture Appropriations, FDA is pro-hibited from implementing any part of the MedGuide regulations until the year 2001. When we get to the year 2001, FDA would be permitted to move for-ward with the MedGuide initiative only if voluntary efforts failed to get writ-ten information to 75 percent of all pa-tients receiving a new prescription. Regrettably, FDA has chosen not to live up to its part of the agreement. The agency's final rule to require Medication Guides for selected pre-scription drugs, which will take effect on June 1, 1999, is in clear violation of federal law. It appears that FDA is de-liberately ignoring the law. It would be my hope that the Administration would hold in abeyance the implemen-tation of the MedGuide regulations, and honor the remainder of the mora-torium relating to this rule making. However, I am not confident that this will occur, and therefore this bill is necessary so that we can put back into place the terms of the agreement that were made with the Administration during the 104th Congress. Finally, I should point out that hold- ing off the implementation of the MedGuide rule will not deny patients access to prescription drug informa-tion, nor will it preclude FDA from communicating with pharmaceutical companies and community phar-macists about the importance of pro-viding information to patients about their prescription drugs. In other words, nothing in this bill should be construed as restricting the ability of the FDA to use its existing authority regarding the provision of written pa-tient information on a product-by- product basis with certain prescription medications. Let the competitive retail pharmacy marketplace continue to make great strides in providing consumers with meaningful, accurate and easily under-stood written information about pre-scription drugs. I urge my colleagues to co-sponsor the ''Pharmacist's Pa-tient Protection Act of 1999.'' By Mr. BINGAMAN: S. 1093. A bill to establish the Galisteo Basin Archaeological Protec-tion Sites, to provide for the protection of archaeological sites in the Galisteo Basin of New Mexico and for other pur-poses; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. GALISTEO BASIN ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROTECTION ACT OF 1999 Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill designed to provide for the protection of various historical sites in the Galisteo Basin. The Basin is located in and around Santa Fe County, New Mexico, as de-picted by this map. (See, map) To un-derstand the importance of these sites, it's important to understand the his-tory of this Basin. Mr. President, when the Spanish Con- quistadores arrived in New Mexico in 1598, they found a thriving native Pueblo culture with its own unique tra-ditions of religion, architecture, and art, which was enriched and influenced by an extensive system of trade. The subsequent history of conflict and co-existence between these two cultures, Pueblo Indian and Spanish, shaped much of the language, art, and cultural worldview of New Mexicans today. That initial history of cultural inter- action in New Mexico encompassed a period of a little over one hundred years from the 1598, through the Pueb-lo revolt in 1680, and the recolonization by the Spanish in the early 1700s. Among these sites are examples of both the stone and adobe pueblo architec-tural styles which typified Native American pueblo communities prior to and during early Spanish colonization, including two of the largest of these ancient towns, San Marcos and San Lazaro Pueblos, which each had thou-sands of rooms at their peak. Also in-cluded in these sites are spectacular examples of Native American petroglyph art as well as historic mis-sions which were constructed as part of the Spaniards' drive to convert the na-tive populace to Catholicism. The twenty six archeological sites ad-dressed in this bill provide cohesive picture of this crucial nexus in New Mexican history, depicting the culture of the pueblo people, and illustrating how it was affected by the Spanish set-tlers . Mr. President, through these sites, we have an opportunity to truly under-stand the simultaneous growth and the coexistence of these two cultures. Un-fortunately, this is an opportunity we may soon lose. Most of these sites are not currently part of any preservation program and through weathering, ero-sion, vandalism, and amateur exca-vations are losing their interpretive value. This legislation creates a program under the Department of the Interior to preserve these sites, and to provide interpretive research in an integrated manner. While many of these sites are on federal public land, many are pri-vately owned and a few are on state trust lands. The vision behind this leg-islation is that an integrated preserva-tion program at sites on Federal lands could serve as a foundation for archae-ological research that could be aug-mented with voluntary cooperative agreements with state agencies and private land owners. These agreements would provide landowners with the op-portunity for technical and financial assistance to preserve the sites on their property. Where the parties deem VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5758 May 20, 1999 it appropriate, the legislation would also allow for the purchase or exchange of property to acquire these very valu-able sites. With such a program in place, we should be able to preserve the history embodied in these sites for fu-ture generations. Mr. President, I would also like to add that this legislation is supported by Cochiti Pueblo which is culturally and historically tied to these sites. I have received a letter from Isaac Her-rera , the Governor of Cochiti Pueblo expressing his support and that of the tribal council. Governor Herrera notes that the tribe has already donated $10,000 to the preservation of one of these sites. This legislation is also sup-ported by the State Land Commis-sioner. Let me conclude by showing you some examples of these magnificent sites. These first 2 charts are from the Comanche Gap site, they are out-standing examples of petroglyph art. The next three charts I have show three of the various pueblo sites. The first, Pueblo Blanco. As you can see the drywash at the top of the picture and the road at the bottom, these are the types of erosion threats which I mentioned earlier. The next picture is Arroyo Hondo. Again, you have a drywash at the top, a major road along the site, and development around the site, which shows the threats posed. Fi-nally is the Pueblo of Colorado, once again showing the threat of erosion from the drywashes above. Mr. President, I want to especially thank Jessica Schultz who has been an intern in my office this past year, and has done yeoman work in providing re-search for this bill and in helping to draft it. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent to have the text of the Galisteo Basin Archaeological Protection Act of 1999 printed in the R ECORD .

SEC. 10. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATION. There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this act. By Mr. CONRAD (for himself and Mr. H ATCH ): S. 1095. A bill to amend section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend the placed in service date for biomass and coal facilities; to the Com-mittee on Finance. THE BIOMASS AND COAL FACILITIES EXTENSION ACT Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I join again with my friend from Utah, Senator H ATCH , to introduce the Bio- mass and Coal Facilities Extension Act. This legislation would extend by eight months the placed-in-service date under section 29 of the Internal Rev-enue Code. We are offering the same bill we of- fered in the 105th Congress because the problem addressed by the bill remains uncorrected. The change we propose is VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5759 May 20, 1999 necessary in order to alleviate a hard- ship taxpayers are suffering as a result of their reliance on actions taken by Congress nearly three years ago. A number of taxpayers made substan- tial commitments of resources to de-velop alternative fuel technology projects in good faith reliance on the incentives provided in the Small Busi-ness Protection Act of 1996. Under that law, Congress intended to ensure that alternative fuel technology projects in-volving coal and biomass would qualify for the credit provided under section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code as long as projects were subject to a binding con-tract by December 31, 1996 and placed in service by June 30, 1998. That should have settled the matter. However, a proposal offered by the Ad-ministration in February 1997 con-tained a proposal to shorten the placed-in-service deadline by a full year for facilities producing gas from biomass and synthetic fuel from coal. The Administration was concerned about what it characterized as rapid growth in the section 29 credit. Con-gress considered that argument, but concluded that no change in the 1996 legislation was necessary. In the tax legislative arena, even a mere proposal can have consequences. When the Joint Committee on Tax-ation published its analysis of the Ad-ministration's budget proposals in March 1997, it warned Congress about just such a consequence as it observed that ''[b]ecause the binding contract date has already passed * * * the pro-posal might place an unfair financial burden on those taxpayers who are bound to contracts entered into prior to the Administration's announce-ment.'' Mr. President, that is exactly what happened\u2014many taxpayers who found themselves in that situation lost their sources of funding because financial in-stitutions were obligated to take into account the possibility that the Ad-ministration's proposal could have be-come law. Because the tax credit plays a significant role in the financial ex-amination lenders must make, its po-tential loss made securing the nec-essary financing impossible for tax-payers who were proceeding in good faith under binding contracts made in reliance on the provisions of the Small Business Protection Act of 1996. The bill would extend the placed-in- service date for a period eight months from the date of the bill's enactment. This would restore some of the time that taxpayers lost as a result of the confusion which resulted from the events of 1997. Let me emphasize that the bill would not authorize any ''new starts.'' The binding contract date provided in the 1996 Act would not be altered. The sole purpose of this bill is to allow tax-payers who began projects under the 1996 Act to proceed in an orderly man-ner to create the kinds of facilities that will help increase the country's useful energy resources. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I stand today with my colleague, Senator C ON- RAD, to introduce legislation aimed at helping companies to develop tech-nologies for cleaner burning fuels. This is important to the people in my home state of Utah where air pollution is one of the top concerns of citizens. I believe that cleaner burning fuels that will reduce emissions is a key ele-ment of the solution to this problem. The Biomass and Coal Facilities Exten-sion Act would provide a tool for com-panies that are stepping into this void and developing clean burning fuels by extending the ''placed in service'' date under section 29 for facilities that produce alternative fuels. Section 29 was originally created to encourage the development of alter-native fuels to reduce our dependence on imports and to reduce the environ-mental impacts of certain fuels. With the enormous reserves of low rank coals and lignite in the United States and around the world, and with the po-tential for use of biomass and other al-ternatives, it is particularly important to the American economy and to our environment that new, more environ-mentally friendly fuels are brought to market both here and in developing na-tions. Bringing new technologies to market is financially risky. In particular, find-ing investors to take a new technology from a laboratory table to the market-place is difficult because working the bugs out of a first-of-a-kind, full-sized plant is a costly undertaking. Incen-tives to bring new, clean energy tech-nologies to the market in the U.S. are a worthwhile use of the tax code. In 1996, Congress provided sufficient incentives to make the development of alternative fuels a viable pursuit by ex-tending the section 29 ''placed in serv-ice'' date for facilities designed to produce energy from biomass or proc-essed coals to July 1, 1998, provided that those facilities were constructed pursuant to a binding contract entered into before January 1, 1997. Many con-tracts were signed and construction projects started. Then the Administration released its budget in February 1997. It contained a proposal to eliminate the extension granted just one year before, cutting off the section 29 credit for plants not completed by July 1, 1997, which is an impossible deadline to meet for many of these projects. Without the assurance of the section 29 tax credit, financing for these projects dried up. Taxpayers were stranded in contracts, some of which contained significant liquidated dam-ages clauses. As a result of the Admin-istration's proposal, taxpayers essen-tially lost a significant amount of the extension given them by Congress in 1996. The bill before us would give compa- nies with projects already in progress and contracts signed by January 1, 1997 some additional time to finish these projects. The bill does not extend the contract deadline, allow more projects to be initiated, or change the 2008 dead-line for receiving the section 29 tax credit. This bill simply restores some of the time that taxpayers lost in their efforts to develop environmentally friendly fuels under section 29. Bringing new alternative fuel tech- nologies to the market is an important part of our commitment to a cleaner environment and a secure economy. Congress reflected that commitment in our efforts to mitigate some of the fi-nancial risk involved in developing this much needed technology in 1996. This bill maintains that commitment. I urge my colleagues to support this leg-islation. By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. BINGAMAN , Mr. D ORGAN , Mr. KERREY , Mr. J OHNSON , and Mr. DASCHLE ): S. 1099. A bill to establish a mecha- nism for using the duties imposed on products of countries that fail to com-ply with WTO dispute resolution deci-sion to provide relief to injured domes-tic producers; to the Committee on Fi-nance. TRADE INJURY COMPENSATION ACT Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, on be- half of myself and Senators B INGAMAN , DORGAN DASCHLE . I rise to introduce the Trade Injury Compensation Act of 1999. Under U.S. trade law, we may retali- ate when a trading partner improperly closes its market to American goods or services. In certain circumstances, the World Trade Organization endorses that retaliation. The normal form of trade retaliation is to increase the tar-iff to one hundred percent on a des-ignated list of imported goods. The intention of retaliation is not protectionist. It is just the opposite\u2014 use the leverage of access to the huge United States market to open up a for-eign market and expand trade. Retalia-tion is a tool designed to inflict enough economic pain on a trading partner that he returns to the negotiating table and removes the trade barriers that started the problem in the first place. Sometimes these negotiations restart quickly, sometimes even before the retaliation goes into effect. Other times, the negotiations start again only after the impact of retaliation sinks in. In some cases, the new one hundred percent tariff raises the price of the imported good so prohibitively that it is priced completely out of the market. In other cases, the product is still sold in the United States, perhaps at a high-er price, or perhaps at the original price with the importer absorbing the added tariff. The United States is increasingly taking trade disputes to the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body. However, some of our trading partners have been, in effect, snubbing their nose at the WTO's decisions. The most egre-gious example of this is the European Union, whose approach to WTO dispute VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5760 May 20, 1999 settlement is, frankly, outrageous. First, in bananas, and now in beef, the EU is using legal and procedural tech-nicalities to delay implementation of important and legitimate WTO panel decisions. Each time they do this, the EU seriously undermines the credi-bility of the WTO as a fair and even- handed place to get trade justice. The Trade Injury Compensation Act establishes a mechanism for using the tariffs imposed when a country fails to comply with WTO dispute resolution decisions. Normally, the additional tariff revenues received from retalia-tion go to the Treasury. This bill es-tablishes a trust fund so that the af-fected industry will receive those reve-nues as compensation for its injury. In the case of agriculture, the money will be spent on promotion and devel-opment of products for the industry. In non-agriculture cases, the money will go to additional Trade Adjustment As-sistance payments to the affected in-dustry. Mr. President, the WTO is a criti- cally important institution that sets the foundation and framework to make world trade grow. We all recognize that it needs improvement, and I, along with many of my colleagues, are work-ing on ways to fix it, starting with the WTO Ministerial in Seattle. But, while the United Staes is striving to support and improve the WTO system, the EU seems to be working overtime to un-dercut the WTO. We must stop this abuse of the WTO, and we must provide assistance to our industries that are damaged by these illegal actions of the EU or others in the future. Within two weeks, the Administra- tion will implement retaliatory meas-ures against the European Union be-cause of its WTO-illegal restrictions on beef. My bill would provide the Amer-ican beef industry with much needed compensation while the retaliatory measures remain in place. I encourage all my colleagues to sup- port this bill. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent that the text of the bill be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: S. 1099 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ''Trade Injury Compensation Act of 1999''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) United States goods and services com- pete in global markets and it is necessary for trade agreements to promote such competi-tion. (2) The current dispute resolution mecha- nism of the World Trade Organization is de-signed to resolve disputes in a manner that brings stability and predictability to world trade. (3) When foreign countries refuse to com- ply with a panel or Appellate Body report of the World Trade Organization and violate any of the Uruguay Round Agreements, it has a deleterious effect on the United States economy. (4) A WTO member can retaliate against a country that refuses to implement a panel or Appellate Body report by imposing addi-tional duties of up to 100 percent on goods imported from the noncomplying country. (5) In cases where additional duties are im- posed on imported goods, the duties should be used to provide relief to the industry that is injured by the noncompliance. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. CRAP, and Mr. D OMENICI ): S. 1100. A bill to amend the Endan- gered Species Act of 1973 to provide that the designation of critical habitat for endangered and threatened species be required as part of the development of recovery plans for those species; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. CRITICAL HABITAT LEGISLATION Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill, together with my distinguished colleagues, Sen-ators D OMENICI and C RAPO , to address one of the most problematic, con-troversial and misunderstood provi-sions of the Endangered Species Act of 1973. This is the provision relating to the designation of critical habitat for endangered or threatened species. As I have often said, the key to pro- tecting our nation's fish and wildlife is to protect the habitat on which those species depend. This is particularly true for endangered and threatened species, which often fall into such pre-carious condition precisely because of habitat loss and degradation. This makes habitat protection for those spe-cies all the more vital. It is thus ter-ribly ironic that the provisions in the ESA relating to habitat are those that present the most problems. My bill goes a long way to fix those problems. It is virtually identical to the critical habitat provisions contained in S. 1180 from the last Congress, which was ap-proved by the Environment and Public Works Committee by a vote of 15 to 3, with strong bipartisan support. Landowners fear that critical habitat imposes severe restrictions on use of their own lands; the Secretary fre-quently does not designate critical habitat to avoid these controversies; and environmental groups often bring lawsuits over this failure to designate. Of almost 1,200 species listed by the Fish and Wildlife Service, only 113\u2014 nine percent\u2014have critical habitat des-ignated. Indeed, of the 256 species listed since April 1996, the Service has des-ignated critical habitat for only two. As a result, numerous lawsuits have been brought against the Service in re-cent years. Currently, 15 active law-suits are pending, with six already de-cided\u2014all against the Secretary\u2014and prospective challenges for another 40 species are on the horizon. These statistics underscore the prob- lems with the existing law with respect to critical habitat designations. The root of these problems lies in the fact that designation of critical habitat re-quires knowledge of the conservation needs of the species as well as an as-sessment of the economic impacts of the designation, neither of which is generally known, or can be determined, at the time of listing. Designation of critical habitat is more appropriate in the context of de-veloping a recovery plan for a listed species, because the recovery plan spe-cifically addresses the conservation needs of the species and provides for an estimate of the costs for recovery ac-tions. Indeed, numerous individuals and organizations, including the Na-tional Research Council, have sug-gested that the requirement to des-ignate critical habitat be moved from the time of listing to the time of recov-ery plan development. As for recovery plans, the Secretary is required to develop and implement recovery plans for listed species. How-ever, there is no deadline for the Sec-retary to do so. Less than 70 percent of listed species are covered in a recovery plan, and 56 percent of those species without plans have been listed for longer than one year. These statistics underscore the need for a mandatory deadline for developing recovery plans. The bill that I introduce today would move the requirement to designate critical habitat from the time of list-ing to the time of recovery plan devel-opment. The bill would also require that a recovery team be appointed, un-less the Secretary states otherwise through notice and comment. The bill would also provide a deadline for devel-opment of recovery plans, no later than 36 months after listing. In the event that the designation is necessary to avoid the imminent extinction of the species, the bill allows the Secretary to designate critical habitat concurrently with listing. A new provision would be added to the citizen suit section that would require any lawsuit challenging the actual designation of critical habi-tat to be brought in conjunction with a suit challenging the recovery plan on which the designation is based. Other than these changes, the critical habitat provisions would remain virtually the same as in existing law. Let me say that I do not have any de- sire to open the broader question of re-authorization of the ESA. I believe that this bill addresses a narrow fix in a way that answers the complaints of both environmental groups and the regulated community. I do not advo-cate the inclusion of other issues not related to critical habitat. There may be another time and vehicle for that, but this is not the time, and this bill should not be the vehicle. In closing, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the distinguished Senator from New Mexico for his co- operation on this issue, and for his de-cision to work on this bill together in lieu of offering a rider on the recent supplemental appropriations bill. I know this issue is of no great impor-tance to the constituents in his home State, and I am pleased to work with him to find a resolution. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: S. 1100 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1.

Mr. President, just a few weeks ago I rose to speak and share with my fellow Senators an extraor-dinary exchange that occurred between myself and Interior Secretary Babbitt regarding the failings of the Endan-gered Species Act in a situation on the Rio Grande River in New Mexico. I told you that the Secretary's remarks were significant because they acknowledged that this law, however well inten-tioned, is not working. I felt Secretary Babbitt's testimony before the Senate Interior Appropria-tions Subcommittee could open the door to significant reform of the En-dangered Species Act, permitting all parties to work together. I pledged to begin serious work on improving the Endangered Species Act, and I am im-mensely pleased today to be cospon-soring this bill with Senators C HAFEE and C RAPO to do just that. I was in the Senate to vote in favor of the Endangered Species Act, but the courts are implementing it in a cart before the horse fashion never con-templated by the Congress. The focus of saving species should be on planning recovery, not using premature habitat designation as a hammer on the heads of humans sharing that habitat. We want to protect endangered species, but we don't want to unnecessarily hurt people. Tying critical habitat des-ignation to recovery plan implementa-tion is logical, defensible, and the right thing to do. This legislation goes di-rectly to the heart of this issue. The protection of endangered species is supposed to be accomplished by first figuring out the necessary habitat for survival, then designating that critical habitat. But the Endangered Species Act and the courts are rushing the process. According to Interior Sec-retary Bruce Babbitt, recent litigation will ''strait jacket'' the federal govern- ment into prematurely designating the critical habitat for, in one case, the Rio Grande silvery minnow. People in D.C. tend to forget that the western United States is the arid, ''great American desert.'' Western riv-ers and streams are primarily sup-ported by melting snow pack. They change annually from roaring torrents in April to bare trickles in June, to dried up river beds in August. The Rio Grande, despite its ''big river'' title, is no exception to this cyclical flow. As a child, I often walked across the dry riv-erbed in Albuquerque. This will be a very dry year in the normally arid New Mexico. The histor-ical hydrographic record shows that be-tween 1899 and 1936, long before Albu-querque grew, or the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District started to farm, the Rio Grande was dry twenty percent of the time in August as meas-ured at the San Marcial Gauge. Now, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serv- ice, prodded by various groups, are claiming a ''new'' water demand on the river for the silvery minnow. They should assert the interest in the water needed for the minnow, but the demand isn't new. The issue, however, is how should that interest be asserted and what the need really is. And, once known, how do we continue to address the human water needs, and at what cost? I believe something is terribly wrong in the way the courts are handling this situation because you may have to close down a river to human users without knowing the habitat needs for an endangered species. The Secretary of Interior is required to base critical habitat designation on the best sci-entific data available, after taking into consideration the economic impact of that designation. I asked Secretary Babbitt whether the Interior Department had sufficient data to determine the true water needs to sustain the silvery minnow in the Rio Grande, and to make an accurate economic and social assessment of what a critical habitat designation would mean to existing water rights owners. Babbitt testified that his de-partment does not have sufficient in-formation, but that it has no choice but to act because of federal court or-ders. The U.S. Supreme Court has unani- mously agreed that the best scientific and commercial data available must be used to designate a critical habitat. Designation of critical habitat is more appropriate in the context of a final re-covery plan for an endangered species, because that plan must specifically ad-dress conservation needs and costs of recovery. This bill will move the re-quirement to designate habitat from the time of listing to the time of recov-ery plan development. The quantity of water needed by the Rio Grande silvery minnow is un-known. The Fish and Wildlife Service has conceded that there has never been a thorough study of the economic con-sequences of providing water as a crit-ical habitat for the minnow. While we all want the silvery minnow and other endangered species to have their critical habitat, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Rec-lamation acknowledge that they do not know what the ''critical habitat'' is or should be. Were the consequences of designation insignificant, a guess-timate might be acceptable. However, as noted by the Bureau of Reclamation, a designation requiring year-round continuous flows on a river that has never produced such flows could have a ''profound effect on downstream water users.'' We must not try to cure the problem of endangered species with premature, uninformed, unscientific critical habi-tat designation, the validity of which has not been substantiated by adequate economic, scientific and social re-search. When the scientific facts on the possible side effects of a drug are un- known, the Food and Drug Administra-tion does not authorize the sale of that drug. Likewise, the Endangered Species Act should not permit designation of critical habitat until we have scientif-ically determined that the habitat des-ignation will be helpful to the species and does not impose unnecessary social and economic side effects. It is abundantly clear that a com- plete environmental analysis of a crit-ical habitat designation is an absolute necessity. Senator C HAFEE , Senator CRAPO , and I are now addressing this il- logical and unworkable current situa-tion with this bill. I thank them for their leadership on the Environment Committee. We will be working with the administration, and I encourage all my fellow Senators to participate in this limited, local and necessary en-dangered Species Act reform. This bill will now tie designation of critical habitat to the development of recovery plans for endangered and threatened species, as it should be. Federal agencies should not have their hands tied by premature designation, forced by litigation. If we want to save species, as was and is the intent of the Endangered Species Act, then we have to plan how to recover them. Recovery plans require objective and measurable criteria for saving species, specific descriptions of management actions, and cost estimates for those actions. This bill will create a manda-tory deadline for developing final, com-prehensive recovery plans. Critical habitat will now be designated in con-junction with those plans. These changes will go towards achieving the original goal of the En-dangered Species Act. I am very proud to be a part of this historic legislation, and I anticipate a bipartisan group, along with the administration, feels as I do. The time has come for common- sense reform to the Endangered Species Act. By Mr. REED: S. 1101. A bill to provide for tort li- ability of firearms dealers who transfer firearms in violation of Federal fire-arms law; to the Committee on the Ju-diciary. GUN DEALER RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 1999 Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to help turn the tide of gun violence by requir-ing greater responsibility from those in the business of selling weapons. Currently, there are over 104,000 fed- erally licensed firearms dealers in the United States. While most of these dealers are responsible small business people, recent tracing of crime-related guns by the Bureau of Alcohol, To-bacco and Firearms (ATF) has found substantial evidence that some dealers are selling guns to minors, convicted felons, and others who are prohibited by federal law from purchasing fire-arms. This direct diversion of weapons from retail to illegal markets is taking place both through off-the-book sales VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov \u2014 SENATE S5764 May 20, 1999 by corrupt dealers and through so- called straw purchases, when an ineli-gible buyer has a friend or relative buy a firearm for him. While federal law already prohibits a person from transferring a firearm when a person knows that the gun will be used to commit a crime, it is very difficult for victims of gun violence to seek legal redress from gun dealers who sell guns to those prohibited from buy-ing firearms. There is very little case law and no federal law giving victims of gun violence the right to sue gun dealers who make illegal gun sales. To remedy this situation, my legisla- tion, the Gun Dealer Responsibility Act, would provide a statutory cause of action for victims of gun violence against dealers whose illegal sale of a gun directly contributes to the vic-tim's injury. I believe this legislation will make unscrupulous gun dealers think twice about selling weapons to minors, con-victed felons, or any other ineligible buyer, either directly or through straw purchases. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent that the bill be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: S. 1101 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1.

FINDINGS. The Congress makes the following findings: (1) In the Cable Television Consumer Pro- tection and Competition Act of 1992, Con-gress stated its policy of promoting competi-tion in cable services and making available to the public a diversity of views and infor-mation through cable television and other video media. (2) In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress stated its policy of securing lower prices and higher quality service for Amer-ican telecommunications consumers and en-couraging the rapid deployment of new tele-communications technologies. (3) In most places throughout America, cable television system operators still do not face effective competition form other pro-viders of multichannel video service. (4) Absent effective competition, the mar- ket power exercised by cable television oper-ators enables them to raise the price of cable service to consumers, and to control the price and availability of cable programming services to other multichannnel video serv-ice providers. Current Federal Communica-tions Commission rules have been inad-equate in constraining cable price increases. (5) Direct-to-home satellite service has over 8 million subscribers and constitutes the most significant competitive alternative to cable television service. (6) Direct-to-home satellite service cur- rently suffers from a number of statutory, regulatory, and technical barriers that keep it from being an effective competitor to cable television in the provision of multi-channel video services. (7) The most prominent of these barriers is the inability to provide subscribers with local television broadcast signals by sat-ellite. (8) Permitting providers of direct-to-home satellite service to retransmit local tele-vision signals to their subscribers would greatly enhance the ability of direct-to- home satellite service providers to compete more effectively in the provision of multi-channel video services. (9) Due to capacity limitations and in the interest of providing service in as many mar-kets as possible, providers of direct-to-home satellite service, unlike cable television sys-tems, cannot at this time carry all local tel-evision broadcast signals in all the local tel-evision markets they seek to serve. (10) It would be in the public interest for providers of direct-to-home satellite service to fully comply with the mandatory signal carriage rules at the earliest possible date. In the interim, requiring full compliance with the mandatory signal carriage rules would substantially limit the ability of di-rect-to-home satellite service providers to compete in the provision of multichannel video services and would not serve the public interest. (11) Maintaining the viability of free, local, over-the-air television service is a matter of preeminent public interest. (12) All subscribers to multichannel video services should be able to receive the signal of at least one station affiliated with each of the major broadcast television networks. (13) Millions of subscribers to direct-to- home satellite service currently receive the signals of network-affiliated stations not lo-cated in these subscribers' local television markets. Where conventional rooftop anten-nas cannot provide satisfactory reception of local stations, distant network signals may be these subscribers' only source of network television service. (14) The widespread carriage of distant net- work stations in local network affiliates' markets could harm the local stations' abil-ity to serve their local community. (15) Abrupt termination of satellite car- riers' provision of distant network signals could have a negative impact on the ability of direct-to-home satellite service to com-pete effectively in the provision of multi-channel video services. (16) The public interest would be served by permitting direct-to-home satellite service providers to continue existing carriage of a distant network affiliate station's signal where\u2014 (A) there is no local network affiliate; (B) the local network affiliate cannot be adequately received off-air; or (C) continued carriage would not harm the local network station. SEC. 203. PURPOSE. The purpose of this title is to promote competition in the provision of multichannel video services while protecting the avail-ability of free, local, over-the-air television, particularly for the 22 percent of American television households that do not subscribe to any multichannel video programming service.

His recent death is a great loss to this institution and to this country. His list of accomplishments is long, his list of friends even longer. I want to ex-press my sympathy to his wife and family. I also want to extend that same sympathy to my friend from North Carolina, Senator H ELMS , who has lost a great friend and advisor. I first met Bud in 1991 when he came out of a well-deserved military retire-ment and took over as Staff Director of the Senate Foreign Relations Com-mittee. I was a member of the Com-mittee at that time. His career as a Navy Commander brought a steady hand and a cool head to the Committe. I knew that when I had new staff mem-ber starting in the Senate I could send him or her to Bud and he would put the staff member on the right track with his fatherly guidance. His maturity and mentoring role will be almost im-possible to replace. I also knew that Bud would provide me with clear-head-ed advice. He was plain spoken and honest, and I truly admired him for that. Even after I left the Committee, I often turned to Bud for assistance or guidance on a particular issue, and he always gave me an honest answer. That counts for a lot up here. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, SENATE S5772 May 20, 1999 Mr. President, the Admiral's many accomplishments have been noted pre-viously by my colleagues. Although I knew of his military background prior to joining the Senate, Bud was too modest to let the rest of us in on just what he had gone through in his pre-vious career as a Navy officer. He saw active duty in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. It has been reported that dur-ing World War II he endured 162 Japa-nese air and kamikaze attacks. One of the papers reminded me of one of Bud's great lines when the Committee was considering whether U.S. Ambassadors should receive additional benefits, in-cluding hardship pay. ''I fought at Iwo Jima,'' he said, ''That's hardship.'' His life experiences helped him keep our work here in perspective. Mr. President, I noted the obituary from the Charlotte Observer was enti-tled, ''Bud Nance, Monroe Native Was an Officer and a Gentleman.'' This was certainly a fitting description of the man, and he will be remembered fondly by all who knew him. f TRIBUTE TO JEFF GLUECK Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to pay special tribute to an out-standing citizen and participant of the distinguished White House Fellowship Program\u2014Jeffrey Glueck from New-port Beach, CA. Mr. Glueck, a management consult- ant with Monitor Co. in Cambridge, Massachusetts, graduated from Har-vard University with honors, receiving his BA in social studies. He went on to earn an MA in international relations from Oxford University on a Marshall Scholarship, where he and a partner won the annual Oxford Debating Cham-pionship. Mr. Glueck has advised the Peruvian and Bolivian governments on economic competitiveness and from 1995-98, directed a national competi-tiveness project for the Venezuelan government and private sector. He was also a pro bono advisor to the Center of Middle East Competitive Strategy, an economic development and regional co-operation project for the signatory governments of the Middle East peace process. Mr. Glueck has maintained his long-standing commitment to public service with his involvement in many community-based organizations. He tu-tored at a housing project as a student in Boston, was editor-in-chief of the Harvard Political Review, was a found-ing participant of the Harvard Commu-nications Project\u2014an inter-ethnic dis-cussion group\u2014and started a recycling program at the Oxford University dorms. Since 1965, the White House Fellow- ship Program has offered outstanding citizens across the United States the opportunity to participate in a once-in- a-lifetime experience. Fellows work closely with influential leaders in gov-ernment and see U.S. policy in action. The nearly 500 alumni of the program have gone on to become leaders in all fields of endeavor, fulfilling the Fel-lowship's mission to encourage active citizenship and service to the nation. This program is extremely competi-tive, choosing individuals that have demonstrated excellence in community service, leadership, and professional and academic achievement. It is the nation's most prestigious fellowship for public service and leadership develop-ment. Mr. Glueck had been assigned to the Export-Import Bank of the U.S. during his White House Fellowship. In this ca-pacity, he works on ways to reconcile free trade with environmental protec-tion around the world. He has helped coordinate a campaign for environ-mental standards of all OECD govern-ments that would withhold public fi-nancing for projects in developing countries that damage the environ-ment. In addition to these responsibil-ities, Mr. Glueck works to counter un-fair trade practices by foreign govern-ments in emerging governments and to promote sales by U.S. companies with environmentally-beneficial products to places in Asia and Latin America that can benefit from American know-how. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Jeffrey Glueck for his accomplish-ments, and especially for being a dis-tinguished recipient of the White House Fellowship. It is an honor to rep-resent Mr. Glueck in the U.S. Senate. f TRIBUTE TO DR. GEORGE VERNON IRONS, SR. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize one of Alabama's great native sons, Dr. George Vernon Irons, Sr., and to acknowledge the eu-logy by Dr. James D. Moebes, given at his funeral service on July 21, 1998. A native of Demopolis, Dr. Irons was Distinguished Professor of History and Political Science, Samford University, 43 years, Distinguished Professor Emeritus, 22 years\u2014a Samford record. Dr. Irons taught not only history but how to make history\u2014teaching 17 stu-dents who become university presi-dents\u2014more than any educator. Dr. Irons was also one of Alabama's true athletic greats\u2014the only distance man\u2014the only University of Alabama track man\u2014ever inducted into the Ala-bama Sports Hall of Fame. Mr. Presi-dent, only three men have been in-ducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame on the first ballot: Ralph Shug Jordan, Paul Bear Bryant and Dr. George Irons. He was its oldest member at age 95. Mr. President, Dr. Irons was truly an institution in himself. He first came to Howard College (now Samford Univer-sity) in Birmingham in 1933. When Dr. Irons reported to Howard College, the school was in serious financial trouble owing a half million dollars. Dr. Irons gave a wealth of leadership, dedication and promise, sorely needed by Howard. The rest of history. Today Samford University is the largest privately en-dowed Baptist school in the world; largest Baptist pharmacy school in the world. The only Baptist university in America with an inspiring domed school of divinity on its campus. Born in Demopolis, Dr. Irons taught at Duke University for two years be-fore joining Samford. Dr. Irons was a founding member of the Alabama His-torical Association in 1947 and at-tended the 50th anniversary of the or- ganization last year in Birmingham. He was also a member of the Southern Historical Association, Alabama Bap-tist Historical Association, Bir-mingham-Jefferson Historical Society and John H. Forney Historical Society. Dr. Irons historical writings were pub-lished by those organizations. He was past president of the Alabama Writer's Conclave and received a dis-tinguished service award from that or-ganization in 1977. He also served as Vice President of the Alabama Acad-emy of Science. Dr. Irons was awarded the George Washington Honor Medal from Free-dom's at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, in 1962 and the George Washington Honor Award in 1963. He was Director of Samford's Freedom Foundation Pro- gram which won a record seventeen consecutive awards. The Samford year-book, Entre Nous, was dedicated by the Samford student body to Dr. Irons, and unprecedented four times during his teaching career\u2014in 1941, 1960, 1969, and 1974. He served as a member of the Jef-ferson County Judicial Commission from 1961 to 1965, selecting circuit judges for the largest judicial circuit in Alabama. Dr. Irons was selected to Who's Who in America, Who's Who in the South and Southwest, Who's Who in Amer-ican Education and Directory of Amer-ican Scholars. Dr. Irons is a true Alabama sports legend. In the early 1920's, the prowess of the Alabama Crimson Tide football had ebbed. However, Crimson Tide track and distance star, George Irons, kept the athletic flame burning at the Capstone as its ''Knight of the Cinderpath.'' The late Senator John Sparkman, a classmate of Irons, said, ''George Irons was all we had to cheer about\u2014if it hadn't been for Irons, ath-letics would have been pretty boring back then.'' His athletic feats have been heralded by legendary Coach Paul ''Bear'' Bry-ant as ''truly outstanding athletic achievements,'' Coach Wallace Wade (three time Rose Bowl winner) as the ''greatest distance runner of his day,'' and Coach Hank Crisp as ''self-made distance star for the Alabama Crimson Tide.'' In 1923, he was described by those who knew him best\u2014his fellow class-mates at the University of Alabama, including the late U.S. Senator John Sparkman: ''George Irons: The South's greatest distance runner and a scholarly Chris-tian gentleman. He is one of the true greats of Alabama athletic history, an honor man in scholarship and a record breaking athlete\u2014that is a real man\u2014 our Knight of the Cinderpath.'' VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov May 20, 1999 [The Corolla, 1923.] At his interment ceremonies Dr. Irons received full military honors. A 21 gun salute was fired and taps bugled in honor of his valiant service in World War II, rising to the rank of Colonel, with 33 years active and reserve duty. It's no surprise his life had such bril- liant radiance. No surprise his devoted valiant service was so broad in scope. Devoted service to: Family. His wife, Velma Wright Irons, a distinguished educator in her own right\u2014sons, Dr. George Vernon Irons, Jr., Charlotte, North Carolina, a practicing cardiologist and William Lee Irons, a prominent Birmingham at-torney. Both have left notable marks on their professions of medicine and law. Parenthetically, Dr. George V. Irons, Sr., and his son, William L. Irons, are the only father-son listing selected to the 1998 Who's Who in America from the entire State of Ala-bama\u2014yet another record for this re-markable man. Alma Mater.

Since the University's founding in 1831, only seven athletes have been selected to become a mem-ber of Phi Beta Kappa. College. Dr. Irons was a key player in seeing Howard College grow from a fi-nancially distressed school, to the larg-est privately endowed Baptist univer-sity in the world\u2014an internationally acclaimed university. Dr. Irons was elected by the Samford University Faculty to serve as Grand Marshall of all academic, graduation and commencement exercises. Leading the academic processionals for fifteen years, carrying the silver scepter, sym-bol of Samford University's author-ity\u2014Dr. Irons wore brilliant blue aca-demic gowns and silks with dignity and distinction. In 1976, the Samford Uni-versity Faculty wrote in the Univer-sity's records by Resolution: ''In the long history of Samford Uni- versity, Dr. Irons must be ranked at the very top in terms of his widespread beneficent influence, the love that former students evidence from him, and his impeccable character and qualities of modesty, humility, kind-ness and selfless service to the Univer-sity.

America salutes Dr. Irons for his character, de-votion to cause, exemplary standards of honor, duty and integrity. America proudly salutes Dr. George Vernon Irons, Sr., one of Alabama's greatest native sons, whose life of devoted serv-ice is an inspiration to all Americans. f TRIBUTE TO CLARA SHIN Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a true champion of public service: Clara Shin of Orange, CA. Ms. Shin is a former AmeriCorps program officer and is cur-rently a distinguished White House Fellow. One of the greatest gifts that Clara Shin has been endowed with is an ap-preciation and a passion for public service. Her background is filled with notable accomplishments that have provided her with a sense of commu-nity and an unfailing commitment to helping others. Ms. Shin received her bachelor's de- grees in physiobiopolitics and govern-ment from Smith College and a Juris Doctor from Stanford Law School. As a law student, she worked at the U.S. Agency for International Development, serving as a legal intern to the Re-gional Legal Advisor for Southern Afri-ca. She later joined AmeriCorps as its youngest program officer and was re-sponsible for developing the first na-tional grant applications for local pro-grams seeking funding. She then man-aged a $25 million grant portfolio for the program and coordinated a service network spanning the Southwest. Ms. Shin also co-designed the $100 million community service component of a Housing and Urban Development ini-tiative to revitalize severely distressed public housing developments. She founded KOSOMOSE Women's Journal, a magazine for Asian American women, and helped start the Tahoe-Baikal In-stitute, a bi-national environmental in-stitute in California and Siberia that trains environmentalists in land and water issues. As one of 17 White House Fellows, Ms. Shin has achieved the nation's most prestigious fellowship for leader-ship development and public service. Her assignment to the White House Of-fice of the Chief of Staff allows her to work hand-in-hand with leaders in gov-ernment on immigration, race, and science and technology issues, where she coordinates working group meet-ings, tracks and manages issues, and meets with advocacy groups. For more than thirty years, White House Fellows have carried out the program's mission to encourage active citizenship and service to the nation. Ms. Shin is an in-dividual who exemplifies this notion. Her efforts to serve those around her are an inspiration to us all. Mr. President, it is with great honor that I pay tribute to Clara Shin for her accomplishment and dedication to pub-lic service. Her enthusiasm for social and environmental causes is both up-lifting and encouraging. I ask my col-leagues to join me in wishing Clara Shin many more years of success. f A TIME TO RESPOND: AMERICAN LAMB INDUSTRY THREATENED BY IMPORT SURGES Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the surging wave of cheap, imported lamb meat that threatens to drown the United States lamb industry, an industry that has been part of our nation's economy since independence. This surge of imports, primarily from the nations of Australia and New Zea-land, can be seen in the numbers col-lected by our federal inspectors. In 1993, just 56 million pounds of lamb meat entered this country and its markets. By 1997, that figure had risen to 84.4 million pounds\u2014a shocking increase of nearly 50 percent. Those figures have been converted to carcass-weight equivalents, and are higher than those collected by the U.S. Commerce Department. But that de-partment's information shows no indi-cation that the surge is slowing. In 1998, a record 70.2 million pounds\u2014by volume\u2014of lamb meat entered the do-mestic market. Not only has the level of imports in- creased, but the lamb meat flooding the domestic market is directly com-petitive with products produced by this nation's lamb industry. In place of lamb carcasses, shipments of fresh, chilled meat\u2014cut and proc-essed and ready for the grocery store shelves\u2014are displacing domestically produced meat across the country. At this point, importers control one- third of the United States lamb con-sumption, a market share that makes it difficult, if not impossible, for our producers to control their own des-tinies. The importers do not participate in voluntary price reporting. In fact, they have actively fought a joint lamb pro-motion program through the U.S. De-partment of Agriculture. Despite ample notice of the effect their skyrocketing levels of imports have had on the domestic industry, and despite ample notice that the industry intended to file a case against them, the importers refused to pull back vol-untarily, or even discuss the situation. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, SENATE S5774 May 20, 1999 The lamb industry's case now rests with the President. I call on this Ad-ministration to follow through with the strong and effective relief this in-dustry needs to regain its footing and confidence. With confidence will come investment, and with investment, will come a more competitive industry. f ROSE FISHER BLASINGAME, NA- TIVE AMERICAN LOUISIANA ART-IST Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a special artist from my state whose art was recently exhib-ited in our nation's capital. She is Rose Fisher Blasingame, a member of the Jena Band of Choctaw who are located in LaSalle Parish in Jena, Louisiana. Rose Fisher Blasingame was born and raised in Central Louisiana, and is married to Micah Basingame and has four children. Her artwork is basketry, an art she is attempting to revive since its loss from their community after the time of her great-great Aunt Mary Lewis who practiced the craft until she died in the early 1930's. From hearing stories from her family and elders, and seeing some of her aunt's work, she de-cided to try to learn this art-craft and bring back this lost tradition. She should be very proud that she has ac-complished this goal. She also makes blow guns, arrow quivers, and tans deer hides. She shares the task of making china berry necklaces with her elders who she also joins in the tradition of passing down stories about creation, medicinal plants and home remedies. Her new goal, which she shares with her elders, is to attempt to bring back the Choctaw language. Her baskets have been based on au- thentic Choctaw artifacts in the Smithsonian. They are splendid works of art which have many complex weaves of light and dark involving a number of incredible shapes and tex-tures. One of her pieces which I saw was composed of an inside weave which was the mirror image of the exterior weave done in reversal contrast of light and dark. She is a beneficiary of a grant from the Louisiana Arts Endowment Pro-gram. By recognizing her artwork, I also wish to honor all Choctaw tribes and culture. The Choctaw call them-selves pasfalaya, which means ''long hair.'' They are of the Muskhogean lan-guage group. The Choctaw were natives of Mississippi and Alabama, making them one of Louisiana's immigrant tribes. After Spain took control of Lou-isiana in 1763, the Spanish government, seeking a buffer between themselves and the English, invited the tribes from east of the Mississippi River into Louisiana. Small groups of Choctaw, including the Jena band, took them up on this offer, and there were several Choctaw settlements throughout north and central Louisiana. Louisiana boasts of many Choctaw place names. Early explorers used Choctaw guides to lead them to the new territories west of the Mississippi. The names given to the rivers, streams and other landmarks have remained as they were named hundreds of years ago. Some of these names include Atchafalaya (long river), Bogue Chitto (big creek), Catahoula (beloved lake), Manchac (rear entrance), and Pontchatoula (hanging hair or Spanish moss). It is also the Choctaw who taught the French and Spanish settlers the use of file' seasoning which is so widely used even today in the gumbo recipes of our unique Louisiana cui-sine. Clearly, Rose Fisher Blasingame knows that she holds the rare coin of her culture which should be cherished and treasured. Imagine the remarkable effort she has undertaken along with her tribe to re-establish their language. In this ambitious effort, Rose has sent her daughter Anna Barber to attend the Choctaw school in Mississippi in that branch of their tribe. I understand there are about 12 Choctaws speakers left among the Jena Choctaw, and the tribe is planning a computer language program which will teach adults as well as children, but aimed specifically at the kids. As always, their hope for the future will be carried by their chil-dren. Mr. President, I thank you for this moment to recognize the work of this remarkable artist and woman, and the Choctaw tribe and culture of Lou-isiana. f TRIBUTE TO JOHN TIEN Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to salute the work and dedication of Major John Tien, a distinguished White House Fellow from Long Beach, CA. Major Tien was chosen as one of the selected few to participate in the dis-tinguished 1998-99 White House Fellow-ship Program. Since 1965, the program has offered outstanding individuals, like Major Tien, the opportunity to apply their considerable talents to pub-lic service. Past U.S. Army White House Fellow alumni, including former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Colin L. Powell, have emerged as great military leaders, and I have no doubt that Major Tien will be success-ful in his future endeavors. As a White House Fellow, Major Tien has been assigned to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. He con-ducts research on consumer, labor, and environmental groups in an effort to educate the American public about the benefits of international trade. Other responsibilities include coordinating partnerships with important business groups, including the National Associa-tion of Manufacturers, the Business Round Table, and the President's Ex-port Council, to develop trade edu-cation ideas and advance a free trade agenda. He is a member of the lead team for planning the Third Ministe-rial Conference of the World Trade Or-ganization in Seattle, Washington. He is also a member of the steel import crisis response team, where he is re-sponsible for drafting reports for the Congressional Steel Caucus. Major Tien is the special assistant to the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative on all WTO matters. Major Tien was an assistant pro- fessor in the Department of Social Sciences at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. He received his bach-elor's degree in Civil Engineering from West Point, where he was the top- ranked military cadet in his class. He later attended Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar. As a veteran of Oper-ation Desert Storm, he was among the first soldiers to cross the Saudi Arabia- Iraq border. He has commanded an M1A1 main battle tank company and a headquarters company, and has served as the chief logistics officer for a thou-sand-soldier brigade. Additionally, Major Tien has successfully balanced several extracurricular activities with his military commitments. For exam-ple, he has served as a volunteer tutor for inner-city elementary and high school youth, as a co-organizer of the New York, Orange County Special Olympics and as a youth league soccer and baseball coach. Mr. President, the importance of the public service should be recognized, and Major Tien stands as an especially admirable role model in this regard. For his efforts, and in recognition of the well-deserved honor of serving as a White House Fellow, I am privileged to commend and pay tribute to Major John Tien. f PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR Mr. HATCH.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall take effect on January 1, 1999, except the amendments made by section 4 shall take effect on July 1, 1999. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee amendments be agreed to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The committee amendments were agreed to. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the Senate considers legislation that will help provide for greater consumer choice and competition in television services, S. 247, ''The Satellite Home Viewers Improvements Act of 1999.'' The bill before us is a model of biparti-sanship and cross-Committee coopera-tion. The cosponsors of this bill in-clude, first and foremost, the distin-guished Ranking Member of the Judici-ary Committee, Senator Leahy, with whom I have worked closely on this legislation; the majority leader, Sen-ator L OTT, and the minority leader, Senator D ASCHLE ; the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Com-mittee's Antitrust Subcommittee, Sen-ators D EWINEand K OHL; and the distin- guished chairman of the Senate Com-merce Committee, Senator M CCAIN. We have all worked together with many others of our colleagues to bring this important legislation along on behalf of our constituents. The options consumers have for view- ing television entertainment have vastly increased since that fateful day in September 1927 when television in-ventor and Utah native Philo T. Farnsworth, together with his wife and colleagues, viewed the first television transmission in the Farnsworth's home workshop: a single black line rotated from vertical to horizontal. Both the forms of entertainment and the tech-nologies for delivering that entertain-ment have proliferated over the 70 years since that day. In the 1940s and 50s, televisions began arriving in an in-creasing number of homes to pick up entertainment being broadcast into a growing number of cities and towns. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, cable television began offering communities more television choices by initially providing community antenna systems for receiving broadcast television sig-nals, and later by offering new created- for-cable entertainment. The develop-ment of cable television made dramatic strides with the enactment of the cable compulsory license in 1976, providing an efficient way of clearing copyright rights for the retransmission of broad-cast signals over cable systems. In the 1980s, television viewers began to be able to receive television enter-tainment with their own home satellite equipment, and the enactment of the Satellite Home Viewer Act in 1988 helped develop a system of providing options for television service to Ameri-cans who lived in areas too remote to receive television signals over the air or via cable. Much has changed since the original Satellite Home Viewer Act was adopted in 1988. The Satellite Home Viewer Act was originally intended to ensure that households that could not get tele-vision in any other way, traditionally provided through broadcast or cable, would be able to get television signals via satellite. The market and the sat-ellite industry has changed substan-tially since 1988. Many of the difficul-ties and controversies associated with the satellite license have been at least partly a product of the satellite busi-ness attempting to move from a pre-dominately need-based rural niche service to a full service video delivery competitor in all markets, urban and rural. Now, many market advocates both in and out of Congress are looking to sat-ellite carriers to compete directly with cable companies for viewership, be-cause we believe that an increasingly competitive market is better for con-sumers both in terms of cost and the diversity of programming available. The bill we consider today will move us toward that kind of robust competi-tion. In short, this bill is focused on changes that we can make this year to move the satellite television industry to the next level, making it a full com-petitor in the multi-channel video de-livery market. It has been said time and again that a major, and perhaps VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5777 May 20, 1999 the biggest, impediment to satellite's ability to be a strong competitor to cable is its current inability to provide local broadcast signals to its sub-scribers. (See, e.g., Business Week (22 Dec. 1997) p. 84.) In fact, marketing re-search by one firm found that 86 per-cent of those consumers who consider subscribing to satellite but ultimately do not do so, decide against satellite service because the local television sig-nals are not available. (U.S. Satellite Broadcasting, ''Research Summary for Thomson Electronics,'' Aug. 1997, p. 6.) This problem has been partly techno-logical and partly legal. As we speak, the technological hur- dles to satellite retransmission of local broadcast signals are being lowered substantially. Emerging technology is not enabling the satellite industry to begin to offer television viewers their own local programming of news, weath-er, sports, and entertainment, with dig-ital quality picture and sound. This will mean that viewers in the remoter areas of my large home state of Utah will be able to watch television pro-gramming originating in Salt Lake City, rather than New York or Cali-fornia. In fact, one satellite carrier is already providing such a service in Utah. Today, with this bill, we hope to re- move the legal impediments to use of this emerging technology to make local retransmission of broadcast sig-nals a reality for all subscribers. The most important result will be that the constituents of all my colleagues will finally have a choice for full service multi-channel video programming: They will be able to choose cable or one of a number of satellite carriers. This should foster an environment of proliferating choice and lowered prices, all to the benefit of consumers, our constituents. To that end, the ''Satellite Home Viewer Improvements Act'' makes the following changes in the copyright law governing satellite television trans-missions: It creates a new copyright license which allows satellite carriers to re-transmit a local television station to households and businesses throughout that station's local market, just as cable does, and sets a zero copyright rate for providing this service. It extends the satellite compulsory licenses for both local and distant sig-nals, which are now set to expire at the end of the year, until 2004. It cuts the copyright rates paid for distant signals by 30 or 45 percent, de-pending on the type of signal. It allows consumers to switch from cable to satellite service for network signals without waiting 90-day period now required in the law. It allows for a national Public Broad- casting Service satellite feed. Many of my colleagues in this Cham- ber will recognize this legislation as substantively identical to a bill re-ported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee last year. It passed the Ju-diciary Committee this year again with unanimous support. I am pleased with the degree of cooperation and con-sensus we have been able to forge with respect to this legislation, and I am pleased that we have been able to bring this bill before the Senate for swift consideration and approval. Let me explain how we will proceed. As I have indicated earlier, the bill we have before us is the copyright portion of a comprehensive reform package crafted in conjunction with our col-leagues on the Commerce Committee. As the Judiciary Committee has moved forward with consideration of the copy-right legislation embodied in S. 247, the Commerce Committee proceeded simul- taneously to consider separate legisla-tion introduced by Chairman M CCAIN, S. 303, to address related communica-tions amendments, including impor-tant ares such as the must-carry and retransmission consent requirements for satellite carriers upon which the copyright licenses will be conditioned, and the FCC's distant television signal eligibility process. It is our joint inten-tion to combine our respective work product as two titles of the same bill in a way that will clearly delineate the work product of each committee, but combine them in the seamless whole necessary to make the licenses work for consumers and the affected indus-tries. To do that, Chairman M CCAIN will today offer the text of his commit-tee's companion legislation as an amendment to the Judiciary Commit-tee's underlying copyright bill. Upon adoption of this amendment, we will offer a manager's package of technical and conforming amendments to more fully meld the bills into a comprehen-sive, pro-consumer package that we can offer to the House for their consid-eration in a conference. I am glad we are taking up this legis- lation today. We need to act quickly on this legislation. The Satellite Home Viewer Act sunsets at the end of this year, placing at risk the service of many of the 11 million satellite sub-scribers nationwide. Many of our con-stituents are confused about the status of satellite service in February and April to as many as 2.5 million sub-scribers nationally who have been ad-judged ineligible for distant signal service under current law. The grant-ing of the local license, together with some resolution of the eligibility rules for distant signals and a more con-sumer-friendly process, can help bring clarity to these consumers, and greater competition in price and service for all subscription television viewers. I again thank the majority leader for his interest in and leadership with re-spect to these issues, and the chairman of the Commerce Committee for his collegiality and cooperation in this process. I also thank my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee who have worked on this legislation. This bill is a product of a bipartisan effort with Senators L EAHY , DEWINE, and K OHL, and I have been pleased to work closely with each of them every step of the way. Finally, I thank the Register of Copyrights, Ms. Marybeth Peters, and Bill Roberts of her staff in particular, for their assistance and expertise throughout this process. The Senate process has been a more informed one, and the product of our efforts more sound as a result of their advice and recommendations. In closing, I look forward to our con- sideration of this important legislation today, and to continued collaboration with my colleagues to help hasten more vigorous competition in the tele-vision delivery market and the ever- widening consumer choice that will fol-low it. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate is able to pass the Hatch-Leahy Satellite Home View-ers Improvements Act. This bill will provide viewers with more choices and will greatly increase competition re-garding network and other video pro-gramming. For some time, I have been concerned about the lack of competition with cable TV and escalating cable rates. This bill will allow satellite TV pro-viders to compete directly with cable and will give consumers a choice. It also avoids needless cutoffs of satellite TV service and protects local TV affili-ates. The Judiciary Committee had a full committee hearing on these satellite issues on November 12, 1997, and Chair-man H ATCH and I agreed to work to- gether on this bill. On March 5, 1998, the Hatch-Leahy bill, S. 1720, was in-troduced and was reported out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously on October 1, 1998. It permits local TV sig-nals, as opposed to distant out-of-State networks signals, to be offered to view-ers via satellite; increase competition between cable and satellite TV pro-viders; and provide more PBS program-ming by also offering a national feed as well as local programming; and reduce rates charged to consumers. We have been racing against the clock because court orders have re-quired the cutoffs of distant CBS and Fox television signals to over a million households in the U.S. Under a preliminary injunction, sat- ellite service to thousands of house-holds in Vermont and other states was to be terminated on October 8, 1998, for CBS and Fox distant network signals for households signed up after March 11, 1997, the date the action was filed. This bill will allow satellite TV to operate just like cable TV with local channels, movies, local weather, sports, CNN, news, superstations, and the like. It allows for local TV stations to be received over satellite, perma-nently, and could reduce satellite rates. It ends the cable subscriber 90-day waiting period for those wanting to switch from cable to satellite\u2014which has been a needless barrier to competi-tion. The bill extends distant network service to allow for a phase-in to local- VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 SENATE S5778 May 20, 1999 into-local TV service and creates a na- tional PBS feed, and also will offer the local PBS. It also restores all lost distant sta- tions, if the satellite provider is willing to restore service, and delays cutoffs of all other distant signals until Decem-ber 31 of this year and only for a much smaller number of dish owners. Ultimately, in 2002, the bill will im- pose ''must carry'' rules on satellite providers just like the ''must carry'' rules for cable TV which permits a phase-in of local-to-local service. The chairman of the Antitrust Sub- committee, Senator D EWINE, and the ranking member, Senator K OHL, also worked hard on this issue. It is absurd that home dish owners\u2014 whether they live in Vermont, Utah or California\u2014have to watch network sta-tions imported from distant states. This committee has worked together to protect the local broadcast system and to provide the satellite industry with a way to compete with cable. Cable TV now offers a full range of local programming as well as program-ming regarding sports, politics, na-tional weather, education, and a range of movies. Yet, cable rates keep increasing\u2014I want satellite TV to directly compete with cable TV. The only way they can do that is to be able to offer local TV stations. We heard testimony in 1997 and 1998 that the major reason consumers do not sign up for satellite service is that they cannot get local programming. I want satellite carriers to be able to offer the full range of local program-ming. We should be encouraging this so- called ''local-into-local'' service. Local broadcast stations contribute to our sense of community. We should be encouraging competi- tion through local-into-local service. Instead, the current policy fosters con-fusion-into-more-confusion service and lots of litigation. By striking a burdensome and flawed limitation on satellite providers, we will be prescribing fairness for dish owners and injecting some much-need-ed competition into the television mar-ket. I look forward to working with my colleagues at conference.

Mr. President, I want to engage my good friend from Arizona, our chairman of the Commerce Com-mittee, in a colloquy concerning an issue I raised in committee on signal reception standards. Mr. M CCAIN. I will be happy to ac- commodate the Senator from Nevada. Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, con- sumers who live in small and rural markets deserve access to network tel-evision service via satellite and the competition with cable it provides just as much as their fellow citizens living in urban markets. The local-into-local VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov \u2014 SENATE S5779 May 20, 1999 service that will be made possible by the legislation we are considering today will provide this much-needed service to consumers, thereby enhanc-ing competition to cable in many urban markets. Unfortunately, because local-into-local will not be available in small and rural markets in the imme-diate future, consumers who live there must depend on satellite delivery of network signals from distant markets. Recent court-imposed limitations on the delivery of distant network signals, however, will affect households that cannot receive viewable local network signals over-the-air. To correct this imbalance, we should grant the Federal Communications Commission the authority to set a modern television signal reception standard. If the new signal reception standard is set at a level that will pro-vide consumers with a viewable pic-ture, then the new standard will produce a more realistic and accurate separation between ''served'' and ''unserved'' households for purposes of SHVA. In addition, such a standard would provide consumers who do not qualify to receive distant network sig-nals with a reasonable expectation that, if they go to the trouble and ex-pense of installing a ''conventional'' rooftop antenna, they will be able to receive a television picture they can actually watch. To make application of the new standard more consumer friendly, I also urge that we give the FCC the au-thority to establish the most accurate point-to-point predictive model. Such a model would enable a consumer to know whether or not he or she will be able to receive a signal of the strength established by the rulemaking quickly, accurately, and without expensive test-ing. Mr. M CCAIN. I think my colleague for his work on this very sensitive but important subject. The senator is abso-lutely correct. With the passage of this bill, the issue of setting an appropriate signal reception standard and pre-dictive model is more important than ever. Consumers are frustrated today by the current situation with distant network signals because they are being told by local broadcasters they must receive their local signals over-the-air, though in many cases traditional an-tennas do not provide an adequate pic-ture. If the law tells consumers they must get a local signal but they aren't able to get a decent picture, what al-ternative does a consumer have? Unfor-tunately, we are dealing here with an antiquated law that needs updating for the twenty first century. Mr. BRYAN. If this law isn't revised we can expect more consumer confu-sion and frustration. The ''Grade B'' standard that is used as the signal re-ception standard today measures the amount of signal intensity that a con-sumer must receive at his or her roof-top antenna to produce what is consid-ered an ''acceptable'' television pic-ture. Unfortunately, this was a deter-mination made in 1952. Consumer ex- pectations of what constitutes an ''ac-ceptable'' picture have increased sub-stantially in the past 50 years. What constituted an acceptable picture to a focus group in 1951 watching black and white television would almost cer-tainly not be a picture that modern consumers would want to watch on state-of-the-art color sets. In addition, interference has in- creased substantially since the early 1950's. Background noise produced by aircraft, automobile and truck traffic, power lines, and the like, and elec-tronic interference produced by com-puters, cell phones, and other elec-tronic equipment interfere with signal propagation. Because of this increased interference, consumers need higher signal intensity in order to receive a viewable television picture. Mr. M CCAIN. I concur with your con- cerns over this situation. If we are going to enforce the law and enforce a standard, we need to make sure that consumers can rely on the standard. Today, that is clearly not the case. In addition, since the purpose of the bill before us today is to give satellite tele-vision the tools it needs to become more viable competitors to cable, we have to evaluate each of the ways in which cable and satellite are compared. For example, the viewing standard that you discussed is based on three ''grades'' of television picture\u2014''fine,'' ''good,'' and ''acceptable,'' in descend-ing order of quality. Currently, cable viewing standards are based on a ''good'' picture. Satellite's standard is ''acceptable,'' which is a grade below ''good.'' Why wouldn't we want the re-ception standards between these two competing industries to be equivalent? If we are to provide true competition between cable and satellite, an in-crease of the standard and a cor-responding increase in signal intensity model is necessary. Mr. BRYAN. Even though the lan- guage mandating a new signal standard and predictive model was not adopted in committee, I think the chairman would agree that such language needs to be incorporated into a final meas-ure. Many of my colleagues have been stunned to learn of the crazy cir-cumstance that is facing many of our rural constituents as they attempt to get a network signal that they can ac-tually watch. We shouldn's be making it more difficult for them to get this valuable service. Mr. M CCAIN. I can assure my col- league from Nevada, we will attempt to address this in conference and rectify a very troubling inconsistency in the law. Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to support S. 247, the Satellite Home Viewers Improvement Act. This legis-lation represents a first step towards providing a viable competitor to cable in the multichannel video program-ming marketplace. Significantly, S. 247 permits direct-to-home satellite pro-viders to transmit local broadcast sig-nals into local markets, and eliminates the 90 day waiting period for existing cable subscribers who wish to switch to satellite service. These critical changes in the law will substantially help sat-ellite providers compete with their cable counterparts. I also support, for the most part, the inclusion in S. 247 of the floor amend-ment offered by the Senator from Ari- zona, Mr. M CCAIN, Amendment No. 372. This amendment is identical to the text of the committee reported amend-ment to S. 303, the Satellite Television Act of 1999, which was reported favor-ably by the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, Senate Report No. 106-51. With one reserva-tion, which I will explain shortly, I am pleased that the work product of the Commerce Committee will be included in the Satellite Home Viewers Im-provement Act, S. 247, as passed by the Senate. As reported by our committee, S. 303 complements S. 247 by removing addi-tional statutory impediments that thwart the ability of direct-to-home satellite service providers to compete with cable television. S. 303 authorizes direct-to-home satellite service pro-viders to offer their subscribers local television station broadcasts, but re-quires those providers to comply with the must-carry and retransmission consent rules that apply to cable tele-vision operators. In addition, S. 303 re-quires the Federal Communications Commission to use the Individual Lo-cation Longely-Rice Methodology to better determine who should be receiv-ing distant network signals and who should not. Finally, the legislation re-quires the FCC to implement a waiver process to give consumers with unsat-isfactory local television reception a timely process in which to have their concerns addressed. While I support moving S. 247, as amended, out of the Senate, I must note one concern with the legislation. I oppose provisions in S. 303 that sanc-tion the illegal behavior of direct broadcast satellite service providers. Those provisions permanently grand-fathered the transmission of distant network signals to subscribers residing outside of their local station's Grade A contour, but within the Grade B con-tour, regardless of whether those sub-scribers are actually able to receive the signals of their local stations. My opposition to this approach is ex-plained in greater detail in the minor-ity views filed with the Committee Re-port. In brief, I will say that the provi-sions I opposed put the legislation squarely in the position of sanctioning illegal behavior. As a law and order man, that is not an approach I am will-ing to support. Otherwise, I am extremely pleased that the Senate has been able to act so quickly on this important issue. By passing legislation so early in the 106th Congress, we have gone a long way to-ward ensuring greater competition in the video programming marketplace. VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5780 May 20, 1999 Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in support of this legislation because it will increase competition between sat-ellite and cable. Senators M CCAIN, HATCH , LEAHY , HOLLINGS , DEWINEand others deserve credit for moving this measure so quickly this term, espe-cially when we came so close last year. Mr. President, when the Judiciary and Commerce bills are combined as one, it creates a good, comprehensive measure. Satellite companies will fi-nally be allowed to legally broadcast local stations to local viewers\u2014so- called ''local into local.'' The strange anomaly that restricted satellite from providing local signals will be a thing of the past. And to be balanced, sat-ellite companies will also be subject to ''must-carry'' obligations, just like cable. This bill will also reduce the royalty fees for those local signals to a level closer to that paid by cable com-panies. All of this moves us towards parity between satellite and cable, and it is a huge step forward for consumers. Let me tell you why. Increased competition will discipline the cable marketplace which, in turn, will create lower prices, increased choice, and wider availability of tele-vision programming for all Americans, no matter how remote. And we do this in the best way possible, by promoting competition, not increasing regulation. Moreover, it won't be at the expense of our local television stations, which provide a valuable community benefit in the form of local news, weather, sports and various forms of public serv-ice. One of the hardest questions to ad- dress, of course, is which viewers should be entitled to receive ''distant network'' signals, especially in rural states like mine. Authorizing ''local into local'' is a crucial first step and, eventually, when technology advances and more satellites are launched, we will see ''local into local'' almost ev-erywhere. So, this bill goes a long way to ensure that every viewer will receive one signal of each of the major tele-vision networks\u2014this is a marked im-provement over the current situation. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan measure which will permit satellite companies to compete on a more level playing field with cable. We have our work cut out for us at conference because the House version is quite different from ours. But there is no excuse for not en-acting this pro-competition, pro-con-sumer legislation this year. Let's get to conference and get this bill done. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill, as amended, be read a third time, and that the Senate proceed to Calendar No. 93, H.R. 1554. I further ask unani-mous consent that all after the enact-ing clause be stricken and the text of S. 247, as amended, be inserted in lieu thereof; that the bill be read a third time and passed; that the motion to re-consider be laid upon the table; and that any statements relating to the bill appear at the appropriate place in the R ECORD . I finally ask unanimous consent that S. 247 then be placed back on the Calendar. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The bill (H.R. 1554), as amended, was read the third time and passed. f AUTHORIZATION OF LEGAL REPRESENTATION Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the imme-diate consideration of S. Res. 104 sub-mitted earlier by Senators L OTT and DASCHLE . The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: A resolution (S. Res. 104) to authorize tes- timony, production of documents, and legal representation in United States v. Nippon Miniature Bearing, Inc., et al. There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution. Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this resolu- tion concerns a subpoena for testimony and document production in an action brought by the United States Customs Service in the Court of International Trade against Nippon Miniature Bear-ing, Inc., and its parent and subsidiary, alleging false representations to Cus-toms about the composition of im-ported bearings. The defendants have subpoenaed Tim Osborn, a former em-ployee of the Senate Committee on Small Business, seeking to depose him regarding his communications with the Customs Service and others about this investigation. Mr. Osborn's activities were on behalf of the Small Business Committee, in preparing for and con-ducting a September 1988 oversight hearing of the Customs Service con-cerning its enforcement of laws affect-ing the bearing industry. The informa-tion that the defendants seek therefore is privileged from compelled discovery from the Congress under the Constitu-tion's Speech or Debate Clause. This resolution would authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to provide rep-resentation in order to move to quash the subpoena and otherwise protect the Senate's privileges in this matter. The resolution would authorize Mr. Osborn and any other former Member or em-ployee of the Senate to testify and produce documents in this case only to the extent consistent with these privi-leges. Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the pre-amble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The resolution (S. Res. 104) was agreed to. The preamble was agreed to. The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows: S. R ES. 104 Whereas, in the case of United States v. Nippon Miniature Bearing, Inc., et al., Court No. 96-12-02853, pending in the United States Court of International Trade, a subpoena for testimony and documents has been issued to Tim Osborn, a former employee of the Sen-ate Committee on Small Business, con-cerning the performance of is duties on be-half of the Committee; Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C.\u00a7\u00a7288b(a) and 288c(a)(2), the Sen-ate may direct its counsel to represent Mem-bers or employees of the Senate with respect to any subpoena, order, or request for testi-mony or documents relating to their official responsibilities; Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United States and Rule XI of the Stand-ing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under the control or in the possession of the Senate may, by the judicial process, be taken from such control or possession but by permission of the Senate; Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or in the possession of the Senate may promote the administration of justice, the Senate will take such action as will promote the ends of justice consistently with the privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That Tim Osborn, and any other former Senate Member or employee from whom testimony may be required, are au-thorized to testify and produce documents in the case of United States v. Nippon Minia-ture Bearing, Inc., et al., except concerning matters for which a privilege should be as-serted. Sec. 2. The Senate Legal Counsel is author- ized to represent Tim Osborn, and any other former Member or employee of the Senate from whom testimony may be required, in connection with the case of United States v. Nippon Miniature Bearing, Inc., et al. f EXECUTIVE SESSION TREATY Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following treaty on today's Executive Calendar: No. 2. I further ask unanimous consent that the treaty be considered as having passed through its various parliamen-tary stages up to and including the presentation of the resolution of ratifi-cation; that all committee provisos, reservations, understandings, declara-tions be considered agreed to; that any statements be printed in the C ONGRES - SIONAL RECORD as if read; I further ask consent that when the resolution of ratification is voted upon the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; the President be notified of the Sen-ate's action and that following the dis-position of the treaty, the Senate re-turn to legislative session. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The treaty will be considered to have passed through its various parliamen-tary stages up to and including the presentation of the resolution of ratifi-cation. The resolution of ratification is as follows: AMENDED MINES PROTOCOL Resolved (two-thirds of the Senators present concurring therein), VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov \u2014 SENATE S5781 May 20, 1999 SECTION 1.

(2) E FFECTIVE EXCLUSION .\u2014The United States understands that, for the purposes of Article 5(6)(b) of the Amended Mines Pro-tocol, the maintenance of observation over avenues of approach where mines subject to that Article are deployed constitutes one ac-ceptable form of monitoring to ensure the ef-fective exclusion of civilians. (3) H ISTORIC MONUMENTS .\u2014The United States understands that Article 7(1)(i) of the Amended Mines Protocol refers only to a limited class of objects that, because of their clearly recognizable characteristics and be-cause of their widely recognized importance, constitute a part of the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples. (4) L EGITIMATE MILITARY OBJECTIVES .\u2014The United States understands that an area of land itself can be a legitimate military ob-jective for the purpose of the use of land-mines, if its neutralization or denial, in the circumstances applicable at the time, offers a military advantage. (5) P EACE TREATIES .\u2014The United States understands that the allocation of respon-sibilities for landmines in Article 5(2)(b) of the Amended Mines Protocol does not pre-clude agreement, in connection with peace treaties or similar arrangements, to allocate responsibilities under that Article in a man-ner that respects the essential spirit and purpose of the Article. (6) B OOBY -TRAPS AND OTHER DEVICES .\u2014For the purposes of the Amended Mines Protocol, the United States understands that\u2014 (A) the prohibition contained in Article 7(2) of the Amended Mines Protocol does not preclude the expedient adaptation or adapta-tion in advance of other objects for use as booby-traps or other devices; (B) a trip-wired hand grenade shall be con- sidered a ''booby-trap'' under Article 2(4) of the Amended Mines Protocol and shall not be considered a ''mine'' or an ''anti-per-sonnel mine'' under Article 2(1) or Article 2(3), respectively; and (C) none of the provisions of the Amended Mines Protocol, including Article 2(5), ap-plies to hand grenades other than trip-wired hand grenades. (7) N ON-LETHAL CAPABILITIES .\u2014The United States understands that nothing in the Amended Mines Protocol may be construed as restricting or affecting in any way non-le-thal weapon technology that is designed to temporarily disable, stun, signal the pres-ence of a person, or operate in any other fashion, but not to cause permanent inca-pacity. (8) I NTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL JURISDIC - TION.\u2014The United States understands that the provisions of Article 14 of the Amended Mines Protocol relating to penal sanctions refer to measures by the authorities of States Parties to the Protocol and do not au-thorize the trial of any person before an international criminal tribunal. The United States shall not recognize the jurisdiction of any international tribunal to prosecute a United States citizen for a violation of the Protocol or the Convention on Conventional Weapons. (9) T ECHNICAL COOPERATION AND ASSIST - ANCE . The United States understands that\u2014 (A) no provision of the Protocol may be construed as affecting the discretion of the United States to refuse assistance or to re-strict or deny permission for the export of equipment, material, or scientific or techno-logical information for any reason; and (B) the Amended Mines Protocol may not be used as a pretext for the transfer of weap-ons technology or the provision of assistance to the military mining or military counter- mining capabilities of a State Party to the Protocol. SEC. 4. CONDITIONS. The Senate's advice and consent to the ratification of the Amended Mines Protocol is subject to the following conditions, which shall be binding upon the President: (1) P URSUIT DETERRENT MUNITION .\u2014 (A) U NDERSTANDING .\u2014The Senate under- stands that nothing in the Amended Mines Protocol restricts the possession or use of the Pursuit Deterrent Munition, which is in compliance with the provisions in the Tech-nical Annex. (B) C ERTIFICATION .\u2014Prior to deposit of the United States instrument of ratification, the President shall certify to the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on For-eign Relations of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House of Representatives that the Pursuit Deterrent Munition shall con-tinue to remain available for use by the United States Armed Forces at least until January 1, 2003, unless an effective alter-native to the munition becomes available. (C) E FFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE DEFINED .\u2014For purposes of subparagraph (B), the term ''ef-fective alternative'' does not mean a tactic or operational concept in and of itself. (2) H UMANITARIAN DEMINING ASSISTANCE .\u2014 The Senate makes the following findings: (A) U NITED STATES EFFORTS .\u2014The United States contributes more than any other country to the worldwide humanitarian demining efforts, having expended more than $153,000,000 on such efforts since 1993. (B) D EVELOPMENT OF DETECTION AND CLEAR - ING TECHNOLOGY .\u2014The Department of De-fense has undertaken a program to develop improved mine detection and clearing tech-nology and has shared this improved tech-nology with the international community. (C) E XPANSION OF UNITED STATES HUMANI - TARIAN DEMINING PROGRAMS .\u2014The Depart- ment of Defense and the Department of State have expanded their humanitarian demining programs to train and assist the personnel of other countries in developing ef-fective demining programs. (3) L IMITATION ON THE SCALE OF ASSESS - MENT .\u2014 (A) L IMITATION ON ASSESSMENT FOR COST OF IMPLEMENTATION .\u2014Notwithstanding any pro- vision of the Amended Mines Protocol, and subject to the requirements of subparagraphs (B) and (C), the portion of the United States annual assessed contribution for activities associated with any conference held pursu-ant to Article 13 of the Amended Mines Pro-tocol may not exceed $1,000,000. (B) R ECALCULATION OF LIMITATION .\u2014 (i) I N GENERAL .\u2014On January 1, 2000, and at 3-year intervals thereafter, the Adminis-trator of General Services shall prescribe an amount that shall apply in lieu of the amount specified in subparagraph (A) and that shall be determined by adjusting the last amount applicable under that subpara-graph to reflect the percentage increase by which the Consumer Price Index for the pre-ceding calendar year exceeds the Consumer Price Index for the calendar year three years previously. (ii) C ONSUMER PRICE INDEX DEFINED .\u2014In this subparagraph, the term ''Consumer Price Index'' means the last Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor. (C) A DDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS REQUIRING CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL .\u2014 (i) A UTHORITY .\u2014Notwithstanding subpara- graph (A), the President may furnish addi-tional contributions for activities associated with any conference held pursuant to Article 13 of the Amended Mines protocol which would otherwise be prohibited under sub-paragraph (A) if\u2014 (I) the President determines and certifies in writing to the appropriate committees of Congress that the failure to make such con-tributions would seriously affect the na-tional interest of the United States; and (II) Congress enacts a joint resolution ap- proving the certification of the President under subclause (I). (ii) S TATEMENT OF REASONS .\u2014Any certifi- cation made under clause (i) shall be accom-panied by a detailed statement setting forth the specific reasons therefor and the specific activities associated with any conference held pursuant to Article 13 of the Amended Mines Protocol to which the additional con-tributions would be applied. (4) U NITED STATES AUTHORITY FOR TECH - NICAL COOPERATION AND ASSISTANCE .\u2014Not- withstanding any provision of the Amended Mines Protocol, no funds may be drawn from the Treasury of the United States for any payment or assistance (including the trans-fer of in-kind items) under Article 11 or Arti-cle 13(3)(d) of the Amended Mines Protocol without statutory authorization and appro-priation by United States law. (5) F UTURE NEGOTIATION OF WITHDRAWAL CLAUSE .\u2014It is the sense of the Senate that, in negotiations on any treaty containing an arms control provision, United States nego-tiators should not agree to any provision that would have the effect of prohibiting the United States from withdrawing from the arms control provisions of that treaty in a timely fashion in the event that the supreme national interests of the United States have been jeopardized. (6) L AND MINE ALTERNATIVES .\u2014Prior to the deposit of the United States instrument of VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5782 May 20, 1999 ratification, the President shall certify to Congress that\u2014 (A) the President, in pursuing alternatives to United States anti-personnel mines or mixed anti-tank systems, will not limit the types of alternatives to be considered on the basis of any criteria other than those speci-fied in subparagraph (B); and (B) in pursuit of alternatives to United States anti-personnel mines, or mixed anti- tank systems, the United States shall seek to identify, adapt, modify, or otherwise de-velop only those technologies that\u2014 (i) are intended to provide military effec- tiveness equivalent to that provided by the relevant anti-personnel mine, or mixed anti- tank system; and (ii) would be affordable. (7) C ERTIFICATION WITH REGARD TO INTER - NATIONAL TRIBUNALS .\u2014Prior to the deposit of the United States instrument of ratification, the President shall certify to Congress that, with respect to the Amended Mines Protocol, the Convention on Conventional Weapons, or any future protocol or amendment thereto, the United States shall not recognize the ju-risdiction of any international tribunal over the United States or any of its citizens. (8) T ACTICS AND OPERATIONAL CONCEPTS .\u2014It is the sense of the Senate that development, adaptation, or modification of an existing or new tactic or operational concept, in and of itself, is unlikely to constitute an acceptable alternative to anti-personnel mines or mixed anti-tank systems. (9) F UNDING REGARDING THE INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN CRISIS .\u2014The Senate finds that\u2014 (A) the grave international humanitarian crisis associated with anti-personnel mines has been created by the use of mines that do not meet or exceed the specifications on de-tectability, self-destruction, and self-deacti-vation contained in the Technical Annex to the Amended Mines Protocol; and (B) United States mines that do meet such specifications have not contributed to this problem. (10) A PPROVAL OF MODIFICATIONS .\u2014The Sen- ate reaffirms the principle that any amend-ment or modification to the Amended Mines Protocol other than an amendment or modi-fication solely of a minor technical or ad-ministrative nature shall enter into force with respect to the United States only pur-suant to the treaty-making power of the President, by and with the advice and con-sent of the Senate, as set forth in Article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States.

Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to speak today in support giv-ing the Senate's advice and consent to ratification of the Amended Mines Pro-tocol to the Convention on Conven-tional Weapons. This amended protocol was adopted on May 3, 1996, and sub-mitted to the Senate for its advice and consent to ratification on January 7, 1997. The Foreign Relations Committee approved this resolution of ratification on March 23 of this year, with no dis-sents. While this is not as big an issue as NATO enlargement or the Comprehen-sive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, ratifica-tion of the Amended Mines Protocol will be a real achievement. Its enact-ment is a further demonstration that the Senate and its Foreign Relations Committee can, in fact, reach agree-ment upon treaties that deal with dif-ficult issues. My colleagues are well aware of the humanitarian crisis that has developed in the world as a result of the millions of unexploded land mines left from the last generation of wars in the world. The United States is a leader in hu-manitarian de-mining efforts, and we have all supported those efforts. But a few examples may help explain to the public why the issue of land mines is of such deep concern. In April 1996, Newsweek magazine wrote about one victim of land mines as follows: He served three years on Bosnia's front lines and survived. But within days of being demobilized, Petr Jesdimir became a cas-ualty of the peace. He was working with a private road crew on the outskirts of Sarajevo last month when an anti-personnel mine buried at the roadside blew up under his left foot. As he stumbled down the road to get help, another mine shattered his right leg. Today he lies in a Sarajevo orthopedic clinic where battle-tested doctors have made their own transition\u2014from treating soldiers hit by grenades to amputating the arms and legs of mine victims, mostly children. Jesdimir, 50, realizes that until he dies he'll probably be a drain on the nation he fought to preserve. ''I know I have to live with this now,'' he sobbed last week, holding up the trembling stump of a leg. ''Now I understand war.'' A year later, The Washington Post recounted the story of another Bosnian victim: The June weather was perfect as 14-year- old Tibomir Ostojic returned home from a dip in a nearby river. ''Cherries,'' he thought. ''Wouldn't it be nice to have some cherries?'' So he climbed a cherry tree not far from his apartment in the Sarajevo neighborhood of Dobrinja. As he was climbing down\u2014and a split-second before his foot hit the ground\u2014 he realized the grass he was about to step on clearly had been avoided by others, and he knew instantly he was in trouble. The first explosion threw him into the air and onto a second land mine. By then he had his hands over his head for protection. The second blast blew them off. Land mines were also the major cause of casualties for NATO forces in Bosnia. Yet Bosnia is hardly the only land where this occurs. A Washington Times article of June 10, 1997, reported: ''The land mines are strewn so widely in the jungles along the cease-fire zones between Ecuador and Peru that when peacekeepers kick a soccer ball out of their compound, it stays there.'' Last year, in the wake of Hurricane Mitch, still more innocent people fell victim to land mines left over from the civil war in Nicaragua. The catalogue of countries ravaged by land mines\u2014long after the end of the wars in which those mines were laid\u2014goes on and on: Afghanistan, An-gola, Cambodia, Mozambique, Vietnam. It was the need to put an end to these seemingly endless post-war tragedies that motivated both the Administra-tion and the Foreign Relations Com-mittee to recommend ratification of the Amended Mines Protocol. The new Protocol is not a complete ban on anti-personnel land mines. Many of us regret that the United States is not in a position to sign and ratify the Ottawa Convention that in-stitutes such a ban. The Amended Mines Protocol is supported, however, by several mine-producing or mine- using powers that would not sign the Ottawa Convention. It is a sad fact of life that countries with fortified borders are not yet will-ing to do without land mines. By ad-hering to this Protocol, they will save many innocent lives while we work to make a world-wide ban feasible for all countries. The new Protocol bans mines that are designed to be exploded by the pres-ence of a mine detector, and it requires anti-personnel mines to be detectable. These provisions will greatly aid mine- clearing efforts in future wars. The Protocol severely limits the use of land mines unless they are both self- destructing within 30 days and self-de-activating within 120 days (in case the self-destruct mechanism should fail). Adherence to these provisions should end the senseless post-war slaughter inflicted by so many mines today. The Protocol establishes an obliga- tion to clean up minefields after wars VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5783 May 20, 1999 have ended. You might think that this was an obvious duty, but countries have often failed to clean up their le-thal mess. Finally, the new Protocol applies to civil wars, as well as international ones. This is a desperately needed pro-vision, as so many of the worst land mine disasters have been the result of civil wars. The Amended Mines Pro-tocol is the first protocol of the Con-vention on Conventional Weapons to be applied to civil wars, and this is an im-portant achievement that is in keeping with U.S. policy and practices. These provisions will go a long way, if adopted and fully implemented by the major mine users and producers, to curtail Future humanitarian crises due to land mines. The amended Protocol specifically meets concerns that the Senate articulated in 1995, when we gave our advice and consent to ratifica-tion of the original Mines Protocol and the underlying Convention on Conven-tional Weapons. For all these reasons, the Amended Mines Protocol deserves our wholehearted support. Bringing the Amended Mines Pro- tocol to the Senate floor has required us to reconcile sharply differing and strongly held views regarding the util-ity and morality of using anti-per-sonnel mines that meet the standards of the Amended Mines Protocol. We owe a debt of gratitude to our col-leagues who agreed to accept resolu-tion provisions and report language that safeguarded each other's positions on the broader land mine issues. One colleague who put the lives of in- nocent civilians ahead of his personal policy preferences is our esteemed Chairman, Senator H ELMS of North Carolina. Senator H ELMS has stated that anti-personnel mines are essential to the U.S. Armed Forces and that a ban on such weapons would needlessly place U.S. forces at risk. The Amended Mines Protocol does not pre-judge, however, the question of U.S. adherence to the Ottawa Conven-tion. Both supporters and opponents of that treaty can support the Protocol's limits on the use of anti-personnel land mines by those countries that retain them. Adherence to the amended Protocol will not require any adjustment of U.S. military weaponry or tactics, more-over. Rather, it will make other coun-tries meet standards that we already have achieved. U.S. military leaders want this Protocol to succeed, because it will save the lives of U.S. service men and women. In the interests of securing ratifica- tion of the Amended Mines Protocol, Senator H ELMS agreed to several major changes in the resolution of ratifica-tion, both last year and again this year, to remove from that resolution any language that would jeopardize this effort by pre-judging the broader land mine questions in his favor. He also issued a Committee report this year that omitted extensive material on land mines and the Ottawa Conven-tion, thus minimizing any unintended affront to colleagues who favor a com-plete ban on anti-personnel mines. Another colleague who has put other people's lives ahead of his own views is Senator L EAHY of Vermont. Senator LEAHY has said many times in this chamber that the United States should adhere to the Ottawa Convention as soon as possible. He has sponsored suc-cessful legislation to fund the search for land mine alternatives, and he has an understandable interest in ensuring the effectiveness of that search. Senator L EAHY is in an interesting position, however: he actually helped to bring about the Amended Mines Pro-tocol. Although he favors a world-wide ban on anti-personnel mines, Senator L EAHY has stated that he also con- siders the Amended Mines Protocol an improvement over the existing Pro-tocol. Senator L EAHY agreed not to seek to amend this resolution of ratification, even though he opposes some of its pro-visions. For example, the resolution will preserve the Pursuit Deterrent Munition until January 1, 2003, even though the U.S. military found that this weapon was too heavy to be of great use to U.S. personnel. It was not easy to bring Chairman H ELMS and Senator L EAHY to agree- ment on a resolution of ratification for the Amended Mines Protocol. Senator C HUCK HAGEL of Nebraska and I, as well as Executive branch officials from sev-eral agencies, had to work at this be-ginning in 1997. Chairman H ELMS and Senator L EAHY agreed early on, however, that ratifica-tion of this Protocol was worth doing, if it could be done without prejudicing their stands on the larger issues. I am very pleased that we achieved such a resolution. I am also proud to be asso-ciated with two fine colleagues who kept their eye on the ball and arrived at an agreement. I want to recognize some of the staff members who have labored so hard to bring about successful U.S. ratification of the Amended Mines Protocol. Mar-shall Billingslea and Edward Levine of the Foreign Relations Committee staff have kept at this for over a year and a half, framing the issues and enabling Chairman H ELMS and me to reconcile our own differences as well as those be-tween the Chairman and Senator L EAHY . Senator H AGEL 'Sstaff also played a major role in reconciling those dif-ferences, especially in the early stages. Tim Rieser of the Senate Appropria-tions Committee staff ably served Sen-ator L EAHY in crafting language that would not subvert the cause of even-tual land mine abolition. Two State Department lawyers de- serve special recognition for their roles. The Principal Deputy Legal Ad-viser, Michael J. Matheson, was instru-mental in the negotiation of the Amended Mines Protocol and in ex-plaining to the Senate its legal intrica-cies. Steve Solomon, an attorney in the office of the Assistant Legal Adviser for Political-Military Affairs, was tire-less and expert in explaining why U.S. ratification is in our national interest. Time and again, Mr. Solomon kept us on track toward reasonable solutions. Without the assistance of those fine civil servants, we would not be ratify-ing this Protocol today. In closing, Mr. President, I want to emphasize that U.S. ratification of the Amended Mines Protocol is an action of which all Senator can feel proud. It will save innocent lives. It will reaf-firm U.S. leadership in codifying the laws of war. Irrespective of whether we eventually renounce all anti-personnel mines, and without prejudicing that debate, the Amended Mines Protocol will serve our national interest and the interests of humanity. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in 1981 the Convention on Conventional Weap-ons (CCW) came into force. The United States was instrumental in drafting that Convention, including Protocol II which imposed modest limits on the use of landmines. The United States signed the CCW, but another 15 years elapsed before President Clinton for-warded it to the Senate for its advice and consent. The U.S. finally ratified it in 1995. Protocol II, commonly known as the Mines Protocol, was, during those years, the only international agree-ment which explicitly dealt with the use of landmines, and it was routinely ignored\u2014not by the United States mili-tary, but by many other countries. And throughout that period the United States and other mine producers sold and gave away tens of millions of mines to other governments and rebel groups who used them against civilian populations. Our mines can be found today, and we are paying millions of dollars annually to help remove them and assist the victims, in some thirty countries. By the early 1990's, it was widely rec- ognized that the Mines Protocol had utterly failed to protect civilians from landmines. In fact, during the previous decade, the number of civilian casual-ties from mines skyrocketed. There were many reasons for the fail- ure of the Mines Protocol, but cer-tainly among them was that it was rid-dled with loopholes, and that its rules were difficult to verify and impossible to enforce. In 1992, convinced that far stronger leadership was needed to solve the mine problem, I sponsored legislation to halt United States exports of anti- personnel mines. I did so because I felt it was wrong for the United States to contribute to the carnage caused by mines, and I believed that little would change unless the United States, by setting an example, encouraged others to act. And that is what happened. In a matter of two or three years, close to fifty governments stopped exporting mines. Today, there is a de facto global export ban in effect. Even governments VerDate Mar 15 2010 22:06 Nov 01, \u2014 SENATE S5784 May 20, 1999 that produce mines and have refused to renounce their use, including Russia and China, have publicly said that they no longer export. At the same time that I was spon- soring legislation in Congress, I was also aware that ten years had elapsed since the Mines Protocol had come into force and that any party could request the United Nations to sponsor a CCW review conference. I saw this as an op-portunity to strengthen the Protocol and to consider banning anti-personnel mines altogether. Since the U.S. was not a party, I and others urged the French Government to request the con-ference. By the time the review con-ference opened in late 1995, the United States had ratified the CCW and was able to participate fully in the negotia-tions. The negotiations were difficult. De- spite efforts by myself, some govern-ments, and non-governmental organi-zations to promote a total ban, the idea was hardly discussed. Instead, the basic premise of the original Protocol remained unchanged\u2014that mines are legitimate weapons of war. To its cred-it, the Clinton Administration made some constructive proposals dealing with, for example, the detectability of mines, and the Amended Protocol re-flects some of those proposals. It re-quires all anti-personnel mines to con-tain enough iron to be detectable, and to either contain self-destruct/self-de-activation devices or be placed in marked and monitored minefields. It applies to internal conflicts, and also contains limits on certain transfers of anti-personnel mines. These are notable improvements, but the negotiators again failed to include effective verification or enforcement provisions. They also refused to include a U.S. proposal to apply the prohibi-tion on non-detectable mines to anti- vehicle mines. Despite these significant flaws, I sup- ported the Amended Protocol and en-couraged the Administration to for-ward it to the Senate for its advice and consent. Indeed, I suspect that had I not sponsored the first law anywhere to halt exports of anti-personnel mines, or urged the French Government to re-quest a review conference, there would not be an Amended Protocol. Last year, after the Foreign Rela- tions Committee reported what I and others regarded as a fatally flawed Res-olution of Ratification, I refused to consent to its adoption by unanimous consent. At that time I made clear that the issue was not the Amended Pro-tocol itself, but a Resolution and Com-mittee Report that contained language that was extraneous, inaccurate, and provocative. Today we are again asked to give our consent, and this time I have, with some reluctance, agreed. I say with some reluctance, because if this Reso-lution and the accompanying Com-mittee Report dealt only with the Amended Protocol there would be no disagreement. In fact, we could have adopted it six months ago. But while the Resolution and Report are far pref-erable to the versions we were pre-sented last year, they also contain lan-guage that has nothing whatsoever to do with the Amended Protocol. That is because, Mr. President, a few members of the Foreign Relations Committee have tried to use this Resolution as a vehicle to attack the Ottawa Conven-tion, governments and individuals like myself who support that Convention, and current United States policy. After reaching a stalemate last year, Senator B IDEN and I worked with Sen- ator H ELMS to resolve our differences. While there is still language in the Resolution which is extraneous and I disagree with, and in the report which is extraneous, factually inaccurate and objectionable, it has been pared down substantially. For that I thank Sen-ator B IDEN and Senator H ELMS and their staffs. They worked diligently to reach a result which, while not perfect, each of us can live with. One of the reasons that I am con- senting to this resolution is that the objectionable report language reflects the views of only some members of the Committee. In fact, much of it deals with issues which were never consid-ered or debated by the Committee as a whole. Rather, it is based on the testi-mony of a handful of like-minded wit-nesses at a hearing that was attended by Senator H ELMS and only one other Member of the Committee, who was a cosponsor of my legislation to ban United States use of anti-personnel mines except in Korea. In other words, to the extent that the Helms Report purports to lay down markers for future landmine policy, it is neither binding nor representative of the views of the Committee as a whole, and even less so of the United States Senate. While there is no need to address every objectionable phrase in the Re-port, two issues require a response. First, the Report states that it is the view of many members of the Com-mittee that the United States should not agree to any prohibition on the use, production, stockpiling or transfer of short-duration anti-personnel mines. Yet the Committee never debated this issue and the views of its members, with the exception of Senator H ELMS , were never publicly expressed. Further-more, and most important, some 135 countries have signed the Ottawa Con-vention which bans the production, use, transfer and stockpiling of anti- personnel mines, and 77 have ratified. They include every member of NATO except the United States and Turkey, and every Western Hemisphere country except the United States and Cuba. They also include many countries that have produced, used and exported mines in the past. To suggest that the United States should remain outside the Convention that is widely and increasingly seen as establishing a new international norm outlawing anti-personnel mines, is in-consistent with United States policy and the interests of the United States. The Administration, including the Pen-tagon, has stated repeatedly and un- equivocally that it will sign the Ot-tawa Convention when it has suitable alternatives to these weapons, and that it is aggressively searching for such al-ternatives. Moreover, 67 members of the Senate voted for my amendment to halt U.S. use of anti-personnel mines, for one year. And 60 Senators, both Repub-licans and Democrats, including every Senator who fought in combat, cospon-sored legislation introduced by myself and Senator Hagel to ban U.S. use of anti-personnel mines except in Korea. Second, the Report notes that the Administration hopes to negotiate a ban on exports of anti-personnel mines in the U.N. Conference on Disar-mament. I believe such a strategy is fraught with problems. It is relevant here only insofar as the Helms Report states that many members of the Com-mittee believes that in future negotia-tions on an export ban the Administra-tion should differentiate between short and long-duration mines. Perhaps those members are unaware that five years ago the United States and Britain proposed such an ''export control regime.'' It was rejected out of hand not only by many of our NATO al-lies, but by developing countries who already had stockpiled millions of long-duration mines and saw the U.S./ UK proposal as an attempt to market their higher tech, higher priced mines. Any attempt by the United States to resurrect that failed approach would only further damage U.S. credibility on the mine issue. I would also refer members to the Mi- nority views in the Report, which ably address this issue. Finally, it is notable that Senator Helms voted twice for my amendment to halt exports of anti-personnel mines, as did the then Major-ity Leader Robert Dole. Those amend-ments passed overwhelmingly, and did not differentiate between short and long-duration mines. Mr. President, the Amended Mines Protocol is a step forward. If adhered to it will help reduce the maiming and killing of civilians, and United States soldiers, by landmines. If its prohibi-tion on non-detectable mines is applied to anti-vehicle mines, as the United States has proposed, that would be a significant advance. But like its predecessor, the Amend- ed Protocol has too many loopholes and can be easily violated. It is a far cry from what is needed to achieve the goal declared by President Clinton and adopted by the U.N. General Assembly of ridding the world of anti-personnel mines. I believe that can only occur\u2014 as was done with poison gas and as the Ottawa Convention would do\u2014by stig-matizing these indiscriminate weap-ons. That will take far stronger United States leadership than we have seen thus far. Mr. HATCH. I ask for a division vote on the resolution of ratification.

WILLIAM F. GOODLING OF PENNSYLVANIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. GOODLING. Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing legislation intended to keep fire- arms out of the hands of those convicted of misdemeanor drug offenses. Current federal law prohibits a person convicted of a felony crime involving drugs and firearms from own- ing a firearm. However, those convicted of lesser drug offenses can legally own a gun. My legislation would impose strict penalties and fines for misdemeanors during crimes such as use or possession of an illegal sub- stance when a firearm is present. Similar to legislation I have introduced in the past, my bill has had the endorsement of the Pennsyl- vania Chiefs of Police and the National Asso- ciation of Chiefs of Police. Quite simple, this bill would expand current law to treat individuals who commit less-seri- ous drug offenses in the same manner as people involved in other drug crimes, such as drug trafficking. Those found guilty of simple possession of a controlled substance, and who possesses a firearm at the same time of the offense, will face mandatory jail time and/ or substantial fines in addition to any penalty imposed for the drug offense. Mandatory jail time and fines would be required for second and subsequent offenses. The guilty party would be prohibited from owning a firearm for 5 years. Exceptions could be granted depending upon the circumstances surrounding each individual's case. Current law states that a person convicted of a drug crime can petition to the Secretary of the Treasury for an exemption to the firearms pro- hibition provided it would not threaten public safety. This legislation will not affect a law- abiding citizen's right to own a firearm. By imposing stiff penalties on people con- victed of lesser drug offenses where a firearm is present, we will send a serious message that the cost of engaging in this activity far outweighs the benefit. If my bill becomes law, individuals owning firearms for legitimate pur- poses (hunting, target-shooting, collecting, or personal protection) and who also engage in the use of illicit drugs will think twice before participating in their drug-related endeavors, facing the prospect of enhanced penalties and the loss of their firearms. Mr. Speaker, the 104th Congress passed legislation to provide increased enforcement on our borders to reduce drug trafficking, and the 105th Congress passed the ``Drug-Free Communities Act,'' to establish a program to support and encourage local communities who demonstrate a comprehensive, long-term com- mitment to reduce substance abuse among youth. Both measures became law. I urge my colleagues to continue to focus its efforts on the drug war by passing this legislation in an effort to crack down on this criminal behavior. Drugs and guns are a lethal combination that must not be tolerated by a civilized nation.CENTRAL NEW JERSEY RECOG- NIZES THE 1999 ASIAN-AMERICAN HERITAGE CELEBRATION AND ASIAN-AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH HON. RUSH D. HOLT OF NEW JERSEY INTHE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in rec- ognition of Asian-American Heritage Month and the many diverse accomplishments of Asian-Americans. I also recognize the Asian American Heritage Council of New Jersey, an organization dedicated to celebrating, inte- grating, and uniting Asian culture in America. Asian-Americans have a long history of meaningful contributions to the United States. On may 22, 1999, the Asian American Herit- age Council of New Jersey will sponsor a statewide Asian-American Heritage Celebra- tion in Edison, NJ. This organization, which in- corporates various Asian-American groups in New Jersey, was founded by Dr. Stephen Ko in 1992. Each year a different ethnic group or- ganizes a celebration in May; this year the ac- tivities are being planned by Chinese-Ameri- cans and will include dancing and shows by various organizations. The Asian-American Heritage Celebration's keynote address will be delivered by my col- league from Oregon, the Honorable D AVIDWU. Congressman W Uis the first Chinese-Amer- ican to be elected to the U.S. Congress. The contributions of Asian-Americans to the society and culture of New Jersey and the United States are a vital part of the American fabric. I hope all my colleagues will join me in recognizing the Asian American Heritage Council of New Jersey. /fdash TRIBUTE TO OUR LADY OF MERCY SCHOOL HON. CONSTANCE A. MORELLA OF MARYLAND IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mrs. MORELLA. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to pay tribute to the faculty, parents, and stu- dents of Our Lady of Mercy School in Mont- gomery County, MD, for winning the Blue Rib- bon Excellence in Education Award from the Department of Education. Our Lady of Mercy School has a tradition of academic excellence, intellectual curiosity, fun- damental moral and religious values, and an atmosphere of care and respect. The school's mission sets goals which foster students' per- sonal growth, empowers students as active learners, and encourages critical thinking and problem solving. Linkages with communities beyond Mercy help students develop an un- derstanding of different cultures and an appre- ciation of global interdependence. In 1998, Mercy received reaccreditation by the Commission on Elementary Schools of theMiddle States Association of Colleges and Schools for its unique project on inclusive edu- cation in regular schools. Mercy's Educational Excellence Program: A Model for Inclusive Education identifies inclusive education as one that serves the physically and mentally chal- lenged, empowers the talented and gifted stu- dent, and uses a multicultural perspective across the curriculum. Academic and non-academic services are revised as Mercy's student population grows and changes. The needs of Mercy's stake- holders have served as the catalysts for the Rainbow and anti-drug programs, prayer part- ners, inclusive life skills instruction, academic tutors, and family health seminars. The role of Mercy's community is to partner in the edu- cation of students, to create a forum for adult learning, and to raise responsible, socially concerned individuals. The Mercy Parent Teacher Organization co- ordinates parent volunteers to assist the school in the total education of the children. During the 1997\u00b198 school year, 96.5 percent of Mercy's families volunteered. Mercy pro- vides parents with educational opportunities through in-house and outside seminars, guest speakers, health programs, print materials, and private consultants. As a former teacher, I wish to congratulate Our Lady of Mercy School for creating the right atmosphere for learning. I am proud of their well-trained staff, their supportive par- ents, and their excellent students. I wish them continued success in creating the excellence in education needed for tomorrow's schools. /fdash HONORING BOB STONE'S RETIREMENT HON. PAUL E. KANJORSKI OF PENNSYLVANIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. KANJORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Bob Stone, who is retiring after more than thirty years in the federal gov- ernment representing the highest ideals of government service. For the past six years, Bob has been Vice President A LGORE's right hand man in leading the reinvention of the federal bureaucracy. Reinventing government is often referred to colloquially as ``REGO'' and Bob has been commonly called ``Mr. REGO'' for his dedication and commitment to creating a government that works better, costs less, and gets the results Americans desire. I first met Bob during the 1980s when he was a deputy assistant secretary in the De- fense Department. He helped resolve a com- plex situation that ended up benefiting both the Defense Department and Northeastern Pennsylvania. Although I had dealt with hun- dreds of federal employees, Bob stood out as a creative and thoughtful public servant who was absolutely committed to making govern- ment work. His dedication to improving the functioning of the Defense Department duringCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0Extensions of Remarks E1036 May 20, 1999 Republican Administrations was brought to the attention of Vice President G ORE, who de- serves a great deal of credit for recognizing Bob's talents and allowing him to run the Na- tional Performance Review in a competent and non-partisan manner. In leading hundreds of career civil servants in the reinventing government initiative, Bob has helped produce some remarkable results: more than $136 billion in savings, a workforce that is smaller than when John F. Kennedy was President, 640,000 fewer pages of inter- nal rules, and the creation of more than 3,000 customer service standards that citizens can use to judge how well agencies are serving their customers. I was struck by Bob's undying belief that government can work if front-line employees are empowered with the ability to exercise common sense. Bob's inspirational mantra was, ``Federal workers know what's not working in government and\u00d0if empow- ered\u00d0can make government work better and cost less.'' Beyond creating a government that was smaller and worked better, Bob wanted to cre- ate a movement. As Vice President G OREsaid at Bob's retirement ceremony, ``Bob's goal was to `fan the flames of reinvention' among front line employees, to empower them to re- invent their workplaces and how they deal with their customers\u00d0to bring common sense to government. He did this, and more.'' Bob Stone is the epitome of the hard- working, unrecognized public servant who is dedicated to doing whatever it takes to accom- plish his mission in a thoughtful and creative way. I speak for many in this Congress when I express my gratitude to Bob for the key role he has played in restoring Americans' belief that government can do the right thing. I wish him and his wife, Roxanne, a happy retirement when they join their children and grandchildren in California. We will miss you, Mr. REGO, but hope your spirit of service and reinvention will live long in the federal government. /fdash IN HONOR OF THE DEDICATION OF CENTER HIGH SCHOOL HON. DOUG OSE OFCALIFORNIA INTHE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. OSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give special recognition to a high school in my dis- trict that has its eye on the future and its stu- dents on the road to success. Center High School in the Center Unified School District will be dedicated on May 22 after undergoing extensive remodeling of its facilities to accom- modate, among other things the continuing emergence of high technology in the class- room, and the growing demand for improved mathematics and science education. The dramatic changes at Center High School come at a time when this school dis- trict faces tremendous challenges in coping with a significant loss of student enrollment due to the imminent closure of McClellan Air Force Base. Despite such a daunting obstacle, forward-thinking trustees, administrators, fac- ulty members, school staff, parents and others in the community moved ahead with plans to give students at Center High School their best possible chance to succeed in a rapidly changing world. It should come as no surprisethat this particular school district took such a leadership role. Even as the Gold Rush swept through California and well before the Pony Express began to link my state to the rest of the nation, one of the area's very first schools opened its doors to students in what is now the Center Unified School District. For almost a century and a half, this community has fo- cused on future generations. At its dedication ceremony, Center High will show off its state-of-the-art science complex and adjoining computer lab, a new mathe- matics wing with adjoining computer lab, a new library with multiple computer research stations, a new 500 seat performing arts the- atre and music building, a special education wing, and a technology-based curriculum inte- grated in the school's Media Communications and Business Academies. It also should be noted that student achieve- ments at Center High School are truly remark- able. Most recently, both the student news- paper and yearbook received the Gold Crown Awards from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association\u00d0their equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize. It is the only school in the nation to win top honors for both publications. In addition, Center High freshman William John was re- cently selected to represent California in Peo- ple to People International at a United Nations conference in Switzerland this summer. It is refreshing and hopeful for all of us to witness the rebirth of Center High School and to honor the tremendous success of its stu- dents. I urge you to join me in congratulating all those involved for a job well done. /fdash STATEMENT ON KOSOVO HON. ROBERT A. WEYGAND OFRHODE ISLAND INTHE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. WEYGAND. Mr. Speaker, earlier this month the House debated several resolutions regarding the current situation in Kosovo. I take this opportunity to address that situation and each of those resolutions. The current situation in Kosovo is indeed a tragedy. People are being forced from their homes, families are being destroyed, people are being murdered because of their ethnic identity. If I may, let me recount some sober- ing facts. To date, over 603,000 Kosovar-Alba- nian refugees have been forced from their homes, an estimated 3,700 people have been murdered, and approximately 400,000 people are roaming the Kosovo countryside. Unfortunately, we have seen this type of ac- tivity far too often. Many of us have taken to this very floor and condemned the actions of the Nazis in World War II, the Ottoman Empire during the Armenian Genocide, the Chinese at Tiananmen Square, the treatment of the East Timorese by the Idonesian Government, and the murder of over a million Rwandans. All of us also condemn the actions of Slobodan Milosevic in his efforts to ``cleanse'' the former Yugoslavia of ethnic minorities. In my view, the United States is the world leader in the efforts to promote democracy and basic human rights. As that world leader, not a police force but a leader, the United States must take its responsibility seriously. Therefore, we must play a role in stopping on- going genocides, preventing future genocides,and promoting freedom and democracy around the world. Unfortunately, this some- times requires the use of United States mili- tary force. There is a great deal of debate over wheth- er this operation in Kosovo is in our interests. I believe it is. As part of our role in the world, the United States needs to take action to pre- serve and in some instances expand alliances that will encourage the establishment of the democratic principles we all cherish. As such, we must remain an active leader in the NATO alliance. The NATO alliance was formed to provide a strong measure of security to Europe, which in turn provides a measure of security for the United States. Political, military, and economic instability threatens U.S. national security and economic interests. This is a region where two world wars began and the threat that this con- flict could spread to neighboring countries is real. It is without a doubt that preventing the spread of this conflict is in our security inter- est. During the debate, the first bill the House considered was H.R. 1569, introduced by Representatives F OWLERand GOODLING. This bill would prohibit the President from using any funds for the deployment of ``ground ele- ments'' without congressional authorization. This legislation is far too broad in its scope. It would prevent using U.S. ``ground elements'' to rescue U.S. military personnel or civilians should that be necessary, it would restrict U.S. participation in a peacekeeping operation, it would handcuff the President from responding with ``ground elements'' to a direct threat to U.S. personnel, and it would have even pro- hibited the rescue of the three U.S. POW's. Passage of this bill, in my view, gives Presi- dent Milosevic permission to act without fear that the United States will respond with the swiftest and most forceful action if necessary. Many have argued that we cannot tell our en- emies what we will do or how we will act, but this bill tells Milosevic exactly what Congress will allow President Clinton to do. While at this time I do not think the use of ``ground elements'' is necessary, I do not be- lieve that we should take any option off the table for any period of time. I do not believe that we should handcuff the President or our military leaders from taking whatever action they need to in responding to a developing sit- uation. This bill would do exactly that. For the reasons outlined above I voted against this bill. The next resolution the House considered was House Concurrent Resolution 82, intro- duced by Representative C AMPBELL of Cali- fornia. This resolution would have required the United States to withdraw, in 30 days, from its participation in the NATO operations. I also voted against this resolution. The unilateral withdrawal of U.S. forces from this operation would signal to the world that we do not sup- port the NATO operation and that the United States is willing to ignore its role as a world leader. House Joint Resolution 44 was the third res- olution the House considered. This resolution was a declaration of war by the United States against Yugoslavia. We are in our third month of air strikes against Yugoslavia and that is too early to discuss a declaration of war. We need to continue the air campaign, which is having some success. This is a time when we need to support both our men and women in harm's way andCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0Extensions of Remarks E1037 our allies. To approve any of these measures would send a message to our troops, allies and enemies that the United States is not uni- fied or committed to ending the tragedy in Kosovo. The final resolution the House considered was Senate Concurrent Resolution 21. This resolution authorized the use of United States air forces to participate in the NATO action in Kosovo. I voted in favor of this resolution. The United States is already involved in the air op- eration in Kosovo and refusing to support that ongoing operation is, in effect, telling our air crews that we are not behind them and this operation. Mr. Speaker, I know that every member of this House supports our men and women in the military but refusing to support this resolution sends mixed messages to them. We must be united in our support of them and must let them know that. /fdash A SALUTE TO OWEN MARRON HON. FORTNEY PETE STARK OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, it is with honor and profound respect that I rise today to sa- lute Owen A. Marron, one of the most exem- plary longtime leaders in the U.S. labor move- ment. Brother Marron was appointed to the Al- ameda County Central Labor Council in 1982 after a two-year stint in the U.S. Army and a long affiliation in the local United Steel Work- ers Union and SEIU. He rose up the ranks of leadership after his appointment to the Labor Council and was at the helm as Executive Secretary-Treasurer for the past decade. He was also elected vice president of the Cali- fornia Labor Federation. Brother Marron will be honored as Unionist of the Year on June 17, 1999 in Oakland, California. His numerous contributions and achievements will be applauded and well wishes will be extended as he retires. He will leave a legacy of commitment, strong leader- ship, unbending advocacy for affirmative ac- tion and for the rights of the disabled commu- nity, and tenacity in organizing and fighting for working people. Brother Marron's forty plus years in the labor movement will be long remembered and his leadership will be missed. I join his friends and colleagues in thanking him for his untiring efforts. Brother Owen Marron has indeed made a positive difference in the lives of many individuals. /fdash CONGRATULATING THE LEUKEMIA SOCIETY ON ITS 50TH ANNIVER- SARY HON. MARGE ROUKEMA OFNEW JERSEY INTHE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mrs. ROUKEMA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to con- gratulate the Leukemia Society of America on its 50th anniversary. The Leukemia Society has led the fight to end this terrible disease and many individuals are alive today thanks to its work. This organization possesses not only the scientific and medical expertise needed forsuch a task, but also the understanding and sensitivity to lend support to the patients and families faced with the challenge of leukemia. I am personally active with the Northern New Jersey Chapter of the Leukemia Society, and dedicate all my work to the memory of our son, Todd Richard Roukema, who was taken from us by the tragedy of leukemia. I take this opportunity to thank Dr. Richard W. Zahn, our chapter's president, for his dedication and hard work. Dr. Zahn is one of the many peo- ple who make the Leukemia Society a suc- cess and is bringing hope to all those families who are facing this disease. In August 1944, 16-year-Robbie deVilliers was diagnosed with acute leukemia. Three months later he died, as did 96 percent of the children diagnosed with leukemia that year. In 1950, as a memorial to their son's brief life, Robbie's parents established the Robert Roesler deVilliers Foundation in an effort to support scientific research into their son's dis- order. In 1951, with an income of $11,700, the foundation approved its first research grant. With the hiring of a medical consultant, the foundation established its principle of awarding research grants to young scientists over the next few years. In 1955, it changed its name to the Leukemia Society, eventually becoming known as the Leukemia Society of America to reflect its national stature. During its half-century of operation, the Leu- kemia Society has grown tremendously, ex- panding its scope and developing a wealth of expertise and knowledge. With an income of more than $83 million a year, the Society now funds research into the blood-related cancers of lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and myeloma as well as leukemia. Under the Leukemia So- ciety's leadership, new chemotherapy drugs combined with radiation treatment have in- creased survival rates. Today, 80 percent of children under 15 survive leukemia and certain types of leukemia can be cured. While the past 50 years of accomplishment brings great hope, one adult or child still dies from blood-related cancers every nine min- utes. Leukemia and lymphoma are the leading fatal cancers in men and women under 35. Cures for these diseases must be found. Re- search challenges remain and the Leukemia Society valiantly pursues its mission. As I have stated, we know personally the tragedy of cancer: My husband, Dr. Richard W. Roukema, M.D., and I lost our son, Todd, to leukemia in 1976 at the age of 17. At that time, bone marrow transplants and other tech- niques that offered hope were only in their ex- perimental stages. Since then, many advances have been made that have spared thousands of other parents the heartbreak we faced. It is thanks to the brilliant researchers and physi- cians supported by the Leukemia Society that hope can be maintained. Today, we are within grasp of a cure for many forms of cancer but much research re- mains to be done. I thank God for those who are willing to labor toward this goal and pray that with their help a cure can be found and that no one will ever again have to suffer from this terrible disease.BLUE RIBBON SCHOOLS HON. RON PACKARD OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. PACKARD. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize and congratulate the extraordinary accomplishments of two schools which are lo- cated in my home district. Concordia Elemen- tary and Moulton Elementary recently were se- lected to receive the Blue Ribbon Schools award. The Blue Ribbon Schools Program was es- tablished by the U.S. Secretary of Education in 1982. Since its establishment, more than 3,500 schools have been recognized for their excellence. Blue Ribbon status is awarded to schools that have strong leadership, a clear vision, a sense of mission, and most importantly, solid evidence of family involvement. Through ex- ceptional academics, athletics and after-school programs, these schools have set themselves apart from other schools. Concordia and Moulton have achieved the recognition of a Blue Ribbon School that comes from their out- standing level of excellence. Teachers, admin- istrators, parents, volunteers and students should be applauded for their efforts. I would like to express my congratulations to these schools. Concordia Elementary and Moulton Elementary should be proud of their accomplishment. Nothing is of more impor- tance to our families, our communities and our country than the quality of education in Amer- ica. /fdash RETIREMENT SECURITY ACT OF 1999 HON. THOMAS E. PETRI OF WISCONSIN INTHE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. PETRI. Mr. Speaker, today I have intro- duced the Retirement Security Act of 1999. This bill, nearly identical to legislation I intro- duced in the last Congress, would help put the Social Security system on a better financial footing while providing future Americans with the peace of mind that comes with their own personal retirement accounts. Under my bill, the government will establish a retirement account for each newborn Amer- ican citizen, initially worthy $1,000. The money for the initial $1,000 will come from income taxes on that portion of Social Security income currently subject to the income tax. This amount is to be invested in the same funds available in the Federal employees' Thrift Sav- ings Plan two of which promise higher rates of return than the Social Security Trust Fund. The investment decisions among the funds are to be made by the parent or guardian until the account holder reaches the age of majority when he or she is able to make such deci- sions. The account holder, or his or her par- ent, can add to the principal of the account, up to $2,000 per year tax free. But even if that ever happens the $1,000, if invested in the common stock index fund, at the historical real rate of return of 7 percent, would grow to $89,000 in 1999 dollars. This happens to be just enough to cover the current average So- cial Security benefit.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0Extensions of Remarks E1038 May 20, 1999 Since the initial $1,000 comes from the Government, Social Security payments owed to the account holder would come out of this account first. Only after it is exhausted would the individual begin to draw on the Social Se- curity Trust Fund. Therefore the financial prob- lems of Social Security would be solved start- ing 67 years after enactment. This would make it easier to deal with the problems we face before that date. If my plan is adopted, future workers will not have to worry so much whether or not the government will keep its promises or that the Social Security system might go bankrupt be- cause each will have an account which is his or her personal property. I don't claim that this program will solve all of the financial problems of Social Security but it will certainly help. /fdash TRIBUTE TO JOHN A. OREMUS HON. WILLIAM O. LIPINSKI OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I would like to pay tribute to an outstanding public servant in my district, John A. Oremus. John Oremus has recently retired after serving as mayor of Bridgeview, Illinois for a total of four decades. Mr. Oremus learned the value of a strong work ethic early on, as he helped out with his father's tanning business and held a job at a gas station. In 1948, he started his own busi- ness. All of his children and grandchildren are now very involved with the business. Mr. Oremus began his career in politics when he was appointed to the Zoning Board of Ap- peals. In 1955, John Oremus became the Mayor of the village of Bridgeview. He re- tained the position until 1963. In 1967, John Oremus was again elected mayor and has held the position ever since. Mr. Oremus continued his hard work as mayor, seeing to it that his vision of ``A Well Balanced Community'' became a reality. This concept was that the Bridgeview community of fine homes and families would have low mu- nicipal taxes and many places in town to work and shop. As Mayor, Mr. Oremus also encour- aged business and industry by offering co- operation and strong Village support services, such as fire and police protection. Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to pay tribute to John Oremus. I am certain that the community of Bridgeview, Illinois will miss his presence as a public servant. It is my hope that John Oremus a enjoys good health and good memories in his retirement. /fdash HONORING WYCKOFF HEIGHTS MEDICAL CENTER HON. NYDIA M. VEL A\u00c2ZQUEZ OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Ms. VELA\u00c2ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Wyckoff Heights Medical Center lo- cated in Brooklyn, New York which is cele- brating its 10th Anniversary. For 10 years, the Wyckoff Heights Medical Center has been helping women and children in communities throughout Brooklyn. It has contributed manypositive things to the quality of life in our neighborhoods, and I would like to thank its leadership and the many others involved in its success. The Wyckoff Heights Medical Center is the hub of the WIC program in our area. Along with its satellite clinics at the LaMarca Family Health Center in East New York, Queensbridge Family Heath Center in Long Is- land City, Park Slope WIC in Park Slope, and the Red Hook WIC in Red Hook, Wyckoff serves an average of 5,800 women, infants and children a year. Like the National WIC program, which this year celebrates its 25th Anniversary, the Wyckoff WIC program has been enormously successful. Nationally, WIC has helped pro- vide nutrition education, health care referral, breastfeeding support and supplemental nutri- tious foods to nearly 7.5 million women, in- fants and children through 10,000 clinics na- tionwide. In addition to its success implementing the mandated WIC services, the Wyckoff WIC pro- gram has sought to enhance its outreach by conducting seminars and workshops through- out Brooklyn. These efforts have included breastfeeding promotion and immunization screening seminars. These initiatives have also been enhanced by the work of Mr. William F. Green, Vice President of Ambulatory Services, who is being honored by the Wyckoff WIC this week. Mr. Green has been a strong supporter of the Wyckoff WIC program since its inception in 1989, and he has helped initiate some unique programs. For example, Mr. Green created a monthly Mother's Day which helps create a consistent outreach to women and children. He also has been supportive of the Wyckoff's special holiday programs, which during the major holidays, makes an extra effort to reach out to the women and children of our commu- nities who are in need of vital services. Mr. Green has made a good WIC program great and on behalf of the community, I thank him and congratulate him on his special award. I would also like to congratulate the fifty WIC children who are graduating this week. These children, all who recently turned five years old, are being honored in a very special way because they have successfully com- pleted their participation in the Wyckoff WIC program. They represent the future\u00d0a future of strong, healthy children and mothers who have the chance to realize the American dream. I urge my colleagues to join me in applaud- ing the Wyckoff WIC program on the occasion of its 10th Anniversary, Mr. Green for his long- time support of the Wyckoff WIC, and most importantly the 50 young WIC graduates and their mothers for a healthy future\u00d0congratula- tions and continued success. /fdash CONGRATULATING THE CENTRAL NEW JERSEY DISTRICT BEST UPS OPERATING DISTRICT IN WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATION HON. RUSH D. HOLT OF NEW JERSEY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec- ognize the Central New Jersey District ofUnited Parcel Service, which has been named the best operating district within the UPS worldwide organization. This district was chosen because of its ef- fective balance in regard to customers, em- ployees, shareholders, and internal practices. UPS employs over 13,000 people in New Jer- sey and services approximately 99,000 New Jersey customers. The Central District serves much of my 12th Congressional District, including all or part of Monmouth, Middlesex, Mercer, and Hunterdon Counties. The district will be presented with the Chair- man's Award for excellence at a celebration on May 21, 1999, in Edison, NJ. Mr. Speaker, the Central New Jersey Dis- trict of UPS is an excellent example for all New Jersey businesses. I hope all my col- leagues will join me in recognizing their ac- complishment. /fdash TRIBUTE TO ASHBURTON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HON. CONSTANCE A. MORELLA OF MARYLAND IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mrs. MORELLA. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to pay tribute to the faculty, parents, and stu- dents of Ashburton Elementary School in Montgomery County, MD for winning the Blue Ribbon Excellence in Education Award from the Department of Education. Ashburton Elementary has a large inter- national student population that represents 38 countries and 20 different languages. The fact that the majority of the international students do not speak English when they arrive pre- sents challenges to the faculty that have been met with great success. Academics are the primary focus tempered with learning other lifelong values. There is a school wide commitment to helping the stu- dents develop respect and responsibility for themselves, their schoolmates, the staff, and the school. Ten years ago the school imple- mented The SHINE Program. The program, which was established to help stress the quali- ties of being Successful, Helpful, Imaginative, Neighborly, and Enthusiastic, recognizes stu- dents who contribute to the school's commu- nity in a positive manner. Students at Ashburton are exposed to the field of technology. The school has a 29 sta- tion Macintosh computer lab, and a Macintosh computer in each classroom. All computers are on a local network (LAN) and are con- nected to the Montgomery County Public Schools wide area network (WAN). Students learn keyboarding, word processing, digital im- aging, and how to use the Internet. In addition to a dedicated principal, staff, and willing students, Ashburton Elementary is supported by an active, interested, and com- mitted parent community. As a former teacher, I wish to congratulate Ashburton Elementary School for creating the right atmosphere for learning. I am proud of their well trained staff, their supportive par- ents, and their excellent students. I wish them continued success in creating the excellence in education needed for tomorrow's schools.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0Extensions of Remarks E1039 HONORING DANIEL J. BADER, RE- CIPIENT OF THE 1999 COMMUNITY SERVICE HUMAN RELATIONS AWARD HON. GERALD D. KLECZKA OF WISCONSIN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. KLECZKA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Daniel J. Bader, recipient of the 1999 Community Service Human Relations Award from the Milwaukee Chapter of the American Jewish Committee. Mr. Bader is president of the Helen Bader Foundation, which has awarded more than $50 million in grants since 1992 with the ex- press aim of advancing the well-being of peo- ple and promoting successful relationships with their families and communities. As presi- dent, Mr. Bader leads the foundation's day-to- day interaction with projects and programs in the United States, mainly in Wisconsin, and also Israel. He is a member of the foundation's seven- member board of directors, which evaluates grant proposals and provides strategic over- sight of the foundation's grants programs, mainly in the areas of Alzheimer's disease and dementia, early childhood development in Israel, economic development, education, Jewish life, and learning and supporting pro- grams for central city children and youth. It is noteworthy to recognize the leadership of Mr. Bader and the foundation in the estab- lishment of the American Jewish Committee's Hands Across the Campus program, which was given its ``jump-start'' in Milwaukee. The program's innovative curriculum and leader- ship development program now operates in five school districts in southeastern Wisconsin. Each year hundreds of high school students are given hands-on experience in bridge build- ing, conflict resolution, anti-bias activities and the deconstruction of prejudice. The Bader Foundation enabled the Milwaukee Chapter of the American Jewish Committee to provide teacher training for practitioners of the Hands program. Mr. Bader is partner in Granite Micro- systems, Inc., a Mequon-based computer hardware firm. He holds a bachelor's degree in business administration from the Rochester Institute of Technology. A Milwaukee native, he and his wife, Linda, reside with their son on Milwaukee's east side. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride and pleas- ure that I commend Daniel J. Bader for his outstanding and innovative contributions to the community, and congratulate him as a most deserving recipient of the 1999 Community Service Human Relations Award from the Mil- waukee Chapter of the American Jewish Com- mittee. /fdash A TRIBUTE TO DR. PAULETTE DALE OF MIAMI-DADE COMMU- NITY COLLEGE HON. CARRIE P. MEEK OF FLORIDA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mrs. MEEK of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Dr. Paulette Dale ofMiami-Dade Community College in Miami, Florida, for her contributions as a speech-pa- thology professor towards the emotional bet- terment of all people. Dr. Dale is the director of the Speech and Hearing Clinic at Miami- Dade Community College's Kendall Campus, where she has taught for 23 years. Previously, Dr. Dale was a bilingual speech pathologist in Dade and Broward County pub- lic schools. She holds a Ph.D. in speech pa- thology and linguistics. Recently, Dr. Dale published a book on as- sertiveness which she hopes will help women to develop self-esteem. Dr. Dale believes that low self-esteem is far too pervasive in Amer- ica, particularly among women. Based on anecdotes from her own life, the book is titled, ``Did You Say Something, Susan? How Any Woman Can Gain Confidence with Assertive Communication.'' It is a privilege to pay tribute to Dr. Paulette Dale, who uses her vast knowledge and her own life experiences to help others. /fdash HONORING MISS AFTON STANFORD HON. GENE TAYLOR OFMISSISSIPPI INTHE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. TAYLOR of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure today to honor Miss Afton Stanford of Poplarville, MS. Miss Stan- ford is the Mississippi winner of the 1999 Voice of Democracy broadcast script-writing contest sponsored by the Veterans of Foreign Wars. As reward for her script, she received a VFW scholarship and an all-expense paid trip to Washington, DC to compete with other na- tional finalists. The VFW's Voice of Democracy Program is a national essay competition that allows high school students the opportunity to share their opinions on service, sacrifice and responsi- bility to their country. The 1998\u00b199 competi- tion theme was ``My Service to America,'' in which students reflected on their individual in- volvement in local communities. Out of the 80,000 participants, Miss Stanford was one of fifty-four finalists, and it gives me great pride to share her winning essay with you. MYSERVICE TO AMERICA (By Afton Stanford) As I stand looking through the thick glass protecting the faded blue uniform, and the yellowed photograph I wonder how old this boy was. If it were not for the fact that he was in the military, I'd say he were my age. He looks like a boy in my chemistry class, you know the silent type that grins a lot but really never says much. I'm not sure if that is what he really was like, but I'd like to think so. Who would ever believe that this young kid would ever have the chance to save others. When I look into his eyes, I don't see a kid who wants to be a hero, I see a kid ready to experience life. Maybe he was a little uncertain about his future, or even wondering if he made the right decision in joining the military, whatever it was I can imagine a mixture of emotions swirling through his dark eyes. At 18, many people might think a kid knows nothing about sac- rifice. But this boy, this young boy, made the ultimate sacrifice. A few summers ago, I volunteered for a women's crisis shelter. At the time I thought it was fun, meeting new people, helping oth-ers in the process. But, only after it was all over did I grasp the concept of ``service.'' Service to my God, service to my country. When I got home I found other places to vol- unteer; I help Red Cross, if any disasters happen and they need help collecting food or handing out blankets, I'll be there. I also help at the food bank, sorting cans that peo- ple donate so the families less fortunate can eat. Giving up Saturdays and spending a week helping others seems trivial, in com- parison to this boy who gave his life to save others, but it's a beginning. I got a great start at home. My parents have instilled in me the desire to help other people improve their lives. My parents stressed the need for helping others, because in helping others everyone lives better. They also taught me to take pride in what I do, the jobs I hold and what I believe. National pride is something sacred. All Americans have lost family and friends to have these rights, and the least I can do is maintain the life they fought for. Sometimes my life gets too hectic and cha- otic to think about anyone but myself. That's why every day I try to make it a point to do something, however little for someone else. From sweeping leaves for an elderly neighbor to working at the food bank I try to pitch in. Helping is contagious. When I have volunteered, my friends have seen how much I loved the people I helped and the work and they have begun to volunteer too. If each American has this attitude it will make a big difference. Part of my service to America is encouraging others to help in any way they can and knowing that every kind- ness honors the people who've gone before us. I believe that being an American citizen means helping others in need. This is one of the strongest values of Americans. For a young man to throw himself on a land mine to save his platoon exemplifies the ideals of self-sacrifice and service that is the corner stone of America. While I'm standing here looking at this display of congressional honor, I wonder how his mother felt. The last time she ironed his uniform and picked off the little stray threads for this display, was she aware of how much I appreciate what her son gave up and what she gave up through him? I only hope that my little sacrifices and services will be able to honor his death and all deaths that make the quality of life that I enjoy possible. I can only hope that one day I'll be able to give a service of this magnitude to my country. ``Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one's life for his friends.'' (John 15:13) As I walk away I hope to take a little inspiration from this boy who selflessly em- bodied these values. /fdash PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON. XAVIER BECERRA OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. BECERRA. Mr. Speaker, on May 13, 1999, I was unavoidably detained during a rollcall vote: number 129, on the Sanders of Vermont amendment, as amended, to H.R. 1555, Intelligence Authorization. Had I been present for the vote, I would have voted ``no.''CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0Extensions of Remarks E1040 May 20, 1999 TRIBUTE TO TERMINAL PARK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HON. ADAM SMITH OF WASHINGTON IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to congratulate Ter- minal Park Elementary School in Auburn, Washington, for their selection as a Blue Rib- bon School. It is an honor to have this school, located in the Ninth Congressional District, as one of only 266 schools nationwide awarded this prestigious honor. The Blue Ribbon School award is given to schools that do an outstanding job of meeting local, state, and national goals, and display the qualities of excellence that are necessary to prepare our young people for the chal- lenges of the next century. More specifically, to receive the award, schools must have strong leaders; a clear vision, and sense of mission that is shared by all connected with the school; high-quality teaching; challenging, up-to-date curriculum; policies and practices that ensure a safe environment conducive to learning; a solid commitment to parental in- volvement; and evidence that the school helps all students to achieve high standards. I commend the staff, students, and parents of Terminal Park Elementary School for their hard work in building an effective community for learning. The focus on literacy and assur- ing students obtain the essential skills needed for life is absolutely necessary and I am glad we have Terminal Park Elementary School as an example for how we need to work toward educating our children. /fdash CONGRATULATIONS TO PRESIDENT LEE TENG-HUI HON. JOE SCARBOROUGH OFFLORIDA INTHE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. SCARBOROUGH. Mr. Speaker, Taiwan, known as the Republic of China, will be mark- ing its President's third anniversary in office on May 20, 1999. President Lee Teng-hui, a Tai- wan-born statesman, should be commended for his leadership and vision for his country. President Lee's leadership lies in his ability to rally his 21 million compatriots into under- standing that the course Taiwan has chosen, both economically and politically, is right for them. President Lee has convinced them that their future lies in free trade and private enter- prise as well as in full democracy. With the help of his compatriots, President Lee will lead the Republic of China to ever greater eco- nomic prosperity at home, while achieving international recognition abroad. On the occasion of the President's third an- niversary in office, I wish President Lee God- speed and good fortune.TRIBUTE TO BROOKE GROVE ELEMENTARY HON. CONSTANCE A. MORELLA OF MARYLAND IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mrs. MORELLA. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to pay tribute to the faculty, parents, and stu- dents of Brooke Grove Elementary School in Montgomery County, MD, for winning the Blue Ribbon Excellence in Education Award from the Department of Education. Students, parents, and teachers at Brooke Grove have forged a partnership dedicated to excellence and committed to the belief that success is attainable for all students. Partici- pation and involvement is of paramount impor- tance and evident throughout all aspects of learning and teaching. Brooke Grove has implemented The William and Mary Language Arts Program for Highly Able Learners; Reading Recovery Program, which is an internationally recognized interven- tion program. The school uses Math and Science Clubs, Science Hands-on kits, Math Content Connections, funded by the National Science Foundation, computer labs, and a re- search/learning hub to enable children to ac- quire skills and learn how to problem solve for the future. At Brooke Grove staff training is essential to the instructional process. New teachers partici- pate in 1 week of training prior to joining the staff and have a coach-mentor throughout their first year of service. A large number of teachers were trained in numerous staff devel- opment initiatives, which include The William and Mary Curriculum; AEMP, Science and Ex- pository Reading; and Gifted and Talented In- struction. The faculty at Brooke Grove has dem- onstrated innovative and creative avenues for acknowledging and motivating students. The environment is one in which children want to achieve, are supported in their efforts to achieve, and are recognized for their accom- plishments. As a former teacher, I am pleased that Brooke Grove Elementary School is being rec- ognized for its fine educational and extra- curricular programs. I congratulate its fine fac- ulty, its supportive parents, and its excellent administrators and wish them continued suc- cess in achieving excellence in education. /fdash LACKENMIER RETIREMENT HON. PAUL E. KANJORSKI OF PENNSYLVANIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. KANJORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an extremely well-respected community leader, educator, and close per- sonal friend, Reverend James R. Lackenmier. On May 20th, Father Lackenmier will step down as President of King's College in Wilkes- Barre, Pennsylvania after twenty-five years of distinguished service to this fine institution. Fa- ther Lackenmier combines the rare traits of having the executive acumen of a Fortune 500 CEO, the devotion to young people of a life- long educator, and the warmth of community spirit of a man who has truly embraced ``TheValley with a heart.'' I am pleased and proud to join in a community-wide salute as Father Lackenmier leaves Northeastern Pennsylvania for new pursuits. The eldest son of Harold and Margaret Mur- phy Lackenmier, Father Lackenmier was born in Lackawanna, New York. He graduated from Canisius High School in Buffalo, New York in 1956, entered the congregation of Holy Cross in 1957, and was ordained in Rome in 1964. Father Lackenmier earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from Stonehill College in Massachu- setts and his S.T.L. from the Pontifical Grego- rian University in Rome. Father Lackenmier went on to receive a master's degree in English from the University of North Carolina in 1968 and a master's degree in Religion and Literature from the University of Chicago in 1970. He has subsequently been awarded six honorary degrees from Our Lady of Holy Cross College in New Orleans, University of Portland, Wilkes University, College Misericordia, Luzerne County Community Col- lege, and the University of Scranton. Education has been Father Lackenmier's focus; he served first as an English teacher in Notre Dame High School in Connecticut and later as the chair of the English department at St. Peter's High School in Gloucester, Massa- chusetts. Father Lackenmier served as the chaplin at St. Xavier College in Chicago and later as the director of the Collegiate Forma- tion program at Notre Dame's Moreau Semi- nary in Indiana. In 1974, Father Lackenmier arrived at King's College in Wilkes-Barre to serve first as the Director of Campus Ministry, then later as Director of Development, and fi- nally as President. Mr. Speaker, Father Lackenmier has had a distinguished career while here with us in Northeastern Pennsylvania. He serves on a long list of Boards and belongs to the pres- tigious Pennsylvania Society, the Knights of Columbus, and the Rotary Club, where he is a Paul Harris Fellow. He has been awarded the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award and the Wyoming Valley Interfaith Council Citation for Devoted Service to the Cause of Human Wel- fare and the Boy Scouts named him their Dis- tinguished Citizen for 1994. Mr. Speaker, I have had the opportunity to work closely with Father Lackenmier during my tenure in Congress on various projects, in- cluding the Earth Conservancy, an ambitious community effort to clean up thousands of acres of mine-scarred land in the Wyoming Valley. Father Lackenmier, along with his aca- demic colleague Dr. Christopher Breiseth of Wilkes University, provided great leadership and courage in guiding what is now an award- winning organization, especially during its tu- multuous early days. I will be forever grateful for his steadfast devotion to making this dream a reality. I will also be forever grateful for the many thoughtful gestures he provided to me person- ally over the years, especially his kindness to me and my family during the period following the loss of my mother. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have had the opportunity to bring the accomplishments of this fine community leader to the attention of my colleagues. In August, Father Lackenmier will go to Salsburg, Austria to direct the Uni- versity of Portland's foreign studies center. He will carry with him my sincere gratitude for a job well done and my very best wishes for continued success and fulfillment.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0Extensions of Remarks E1041 HONORING OLIVE BEASLEY HON. DALE E. KILDEE OF MICHIGAN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I come before you today with a heavy heart, as I stand here to recognize the lifetime achievements of a woman who gave much to her family and her community, in the name of equal rights for all. On May 21, the Beasley family, local officials, civic leaders, and members of the Flint, Michi- gan, community will gather to honor the mem- ory of Ms. Olive Beasley of Flint, who died May 13. Olive Beasley was born in Chicago, and upon moving to Michigan, worked for the NAACP, where she was an integral part in the campaign in favor of Michigan's Fair Employ- ment Act. She was later transferred to Flint, in the 1960's, and began a tenure with the Michi- gan Civil Rights Commission. Olive rose through the ranks, and for 16 years, headed the Civil Rights Commission's Flint office. Dur- ing that time, she also began a long lasting partnership with the Flint Civil Service Com- mission. In fact, Olive was the Civil Service Commisison's longest serving member. Her tireless and selfless efforts to ensure that each and every person received the same opportu- nities for success made her known as one of the area's most staunch advocates, and in many eyes, Olive was indeed the mother of Flint's civil rights movement. Olive was a steadfast member of the Flint community, and constantly served as a role model and counselor for people throughout the city, including many city officials, who turned to her for advice and insight. Many of Flint's most prominent public servants credit their involvement in politics and activism to Ol- ive's influence. Her dedication to civil rights extended beyond the Civil Rights Commission, as she became a member and served on the boards of such groups as the Urban League of Flint, the Urban Coalition of Greater Flint, the Legal Aid Society, and the advisory board of WFUM, the public television station of the University of Michigan-Flint. Mr. Speaker, the Flint area, as well as the entire state of Michigan has lost one of its strongest advocates for civil rights. Olive Beasley will always be remembered as a giant person in the community. The respect she commanded from everyone she came into contact with was tremendous. My sincerest condolences go out to her family. She will be sorely missed. /fdash CONGRATULATING THE SUMMIT SCHOOL ON BEING NAMED A BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL HON. STENY H. HOYER OFMARYLAND IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize The Summit School of Edgewater, Maryland on being named a 1998\u00b11999 Blue Ribbon School by the United States Depart- ment of Education. This is a special honor because The Sum- mit School is a special institution. They strivefor excellence and they have achieved that goal. The non-profit private school was cre- ated ten years ago to promote literacy among children ages 6 to 15 with unique educational needs. They opened their doors in 1989 with 25 students and now have 104 students rep- resenting six Maryland counties and the Dis- trict of Columbia. The Summit School's mission is to leave no room for failure. The teachers foster an envi- ronment where success is an attainable per- sonal goal for each and every student. The School houses a media center, an extensive collection of books, films, tapes and com- puters with Internet access. In addition to their classrooms, the school has transformed a barn into intimate reading rooms. Their record of achievement thus far is reflective of their dedication to the needs of their students; since The Summit School's creation, seventy per- cent of the students increased their reading scores by three or more grade levels in 4 years or less. Seventy-five percent of all eighth grade graduates go on to attend public and private schools with only limited support but great success. Mr. Speaker, The Summit School is one of those great success stories which are often overlooked. the hard working teachers and students of The Summit School have earned the right to be called ``A Blue Ribbon School.'' The Blue Ribbon Award is given to schools which display qualities of excellence, high quality teaching and up-to-date curriculum. The Summit school embodies all of these qualities and more. The school motto, ``Teachers of Excellence'' guides the educators in this institution as they work hard to bring out the best in their stu- dents. Teachers conduct lengthy staff meet- ings on a regular basis to address individual student's needs. They also undergo year- round training to constantly enhance their teaching skills. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have The Sum- mit School in my Congressional District. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the teachers, parents, students and community members who have made this school an insti- tution that should serve as a model for schools around the state and throughout the country. /fdash INTRODUCTION OF THE MSPA CLARIFICATION ACT OF 1999 HON. CHARLES T. CANADY OFFLORIDA INTHE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. CANADY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, Amer- ica's farming community plays a vital role in the prosperity of the nation. Our growers are facing tremendous challenges as the world economy changes\u00d0changes in international competition, environmental stewardship, and providing for the nutritional needs of the plan- et's growing population. Given these pres- sures, farmers should not have to contend with government agencies that overstep regu- latory boundaries set by Congress. Unfortu- nately, this is precisely what is happening. Agriculture is a labor-intensive industry, par- ticularly during the planting and harvesting seasons. This is especially true for specialty crops such as citrus, vegetables, apples, andpeaches, which are grown in many different regions of the country. Temporary and migrant workers are critical to meeting the need for farm labor. Congress, through the Migrant and Seasonal Workers Protection Act (MSPA) and other initiatives, created a national standard to ensure safe working conditions for these work- ers and entrusted enforcement of these laws and regulations, primarily with the Department of Labor. The need for effective migrant worker pro- tections is well recognized; however, current federal policies are placing an unfair burden upon agricultural employers. In 1997, the De- partment of Labor issued a new interpretation of the joint employer rule found in MSPA that holds farmers to a stricter standard than other employers. The new regulation is written so broadly that virtually any grower can be classi- fied as a joint employer for liability purposes. This is in spite of several court rulings that struck down the Department's attempts to in- terpret the joint employer rule in such a fash- ion. Because the new guidelines would apply to MSPA alone, only agriculture employers are subject to them. This action, combined with overlapping housing regulations, Department of Labor initiatives to classify year-round em- ployees as seasonal workers, onerous federal transportation insurance requirements, and other policies are selectively punitive and un- fair to agriculture. The MSPA Clarification Act, which I am in- troducing today, seeks to ease the inequitable burden on farmers. The bill would restore the original definition of joint employer and make other common sense changes in the regu- latory structure governing agricultural labor. It would clarify that farm workers who enter into voluntary carpool arrangements should not be classified by the Department of Labor as li- censed farm labor contractors in violation of MSPA; grant farmers a 10-day grace period in which they may correct MSPA violations; streamline worker housing regulations; and re- quire federal investigators to confer with grow- ers prior to entering the farm operation. The MSPA Clarification Act does not weak- en or do away with the basic protections af- forded to migrant workers under MSPA. It merely seeks to provide for a reasonable rela- tionship between growers and the government by returning to the original intent of Congress for MSPA. The legislation is supported by the American Farm Bureau Federation and other agricultural groups from around the country. It has the bipartisan support of many in Con- gress. I look forward to working with my col- leagues to ensure a safe and productive farm workplace through this important piece of leg- islation. /fdash CAPTAIN DONALD E. PETERS, USN HON. SOLOMON P. ORTIZ OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a great American warrior, Captain Donald E. Peters, of the United States Navy. Captain Peters will end his 30 year career with the Navy on May 28, 1999, a career that has included a host of commands. Most nota- bly for South Texas, one of those commands included the Mine Warfare Center of Excel- lence at Naval Station Ingleside (NSI) on the Bay of Corpus Christi.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0Extensions of Remarks E1042 May 20, 1999 I was always taken with Captain Peters' style of leadership; his philosophy seemed to be: ``Shut up and do it.'' He led by example. He became involved, and stayed involved, in all the things that affected Naval Station Ingleside's mission or the sailors there. Captain Peters' most significant accomplish- ment at NSI was the leadership he showed in effort and innovation, an accomplishment that won a presidential tribute for NSI. NSI was recognized with the annual Commander in Chief's Installation Excellence Award in 1997. The base was chosen from among 135 instal- lations world-wide, and was selected from among 11 semi-finalists. It was innovation in the following areas that attracted the award: leadership, retention of personnel, equal employment opportunity, community relations, energy conservation, pol- lution prevention, food service excellence and recreational activities. Captain Peters' service and leadership was pivotal in the development of NSI. In 1992, NSI began with 500 sailors. By the end of 1996, just prior to this award, it had over 4,000 personnel, making it one of the Navy's fastest growing military facilities. Continuing that trend, by next year, NSI will have around 5,000 military and civilian employees at the base. In 1995, Captain Peters streamlined the base's administrative staff from nine depart- ment to five departments. The move made op- erations more efficient and responsive to the needs of the sailors. Military organizations tend to note efficient models of success, and NSI's administrative operations were rapidly adopted Navy-wide for emulation at similar- sized installations. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in paying tribute to a lifetime of service by Captain Donald E. Peters, a real American patriot and hero. /fdash TRIBUTE TO WINSTON WILSON HON. CHARLES W. STENHOLM OF TEXAS INTHE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. STENHOLM. Mr. Speaker, this week the Nation, and particularly the agricultural indus- try, lost one of its most important assets, Win- ston Wilson. Winston made a difference for his family, his community, his industry and for this country. I got to know Winston before either one of us moved to Washington. Following his serv- ice as Deputy Undersecretary of Agriculture in the Carter Administration, Winston came to my Congressional office as Administrative Assist- ant. His time in my office was brief\u00d0just about a year from December 1980 to November 1981\u00d0but that was plenty of time for Winston and his wife Mickie, and daughters Michelle and Missy, to endear themselves to us and to become a permanent part of our office family. In an era where the voices of agriculture are becoming fewer and fainter, Winston stood out as one of the most effective spokespersons for the wheat farmers from whom he came. His Daddy trained him well in the fields at Quanah, giving him the kind of Texas common sense that few possess at the national level. Winston never forgot his roots, even though he traveled the world over in promotion of U.S. Agriculture.When Winston left my office, he continued his advocacy of the industry at U.S. Wheat Associates, where he served as President until 1997. He also was Chairman of the U.S. Agricultural Export Development Council, founding member of the U.S. Grain Quality Workshop, a former President of the National Association of Wheat Growers, and a member of the U.S. Agriculture Department's Trade Advisory Committee. More than anything, Winston committed his life to the advocacy of American wheat. He spent a great portion of his life working hard to develop overseas markets for U.S. farmers, and he developed strategies and programs to build export demand for U.S. wheat. U.S. Wheat Associates, with whom Winston had such a long relationship, is a worldwide orga- nization supported by wheat producers in Texas and 17 other states along with USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service. Under Winston's leadership, the organization has been suc- cessful in establishing and servicing markets for up to 60 percent of the wheat produced in the U.S. and up to 80 percent of the wheat produced in Texas. The farm economy is struggling at the present time but without Win- ston's efforts, our struggles would be far great- er. Winston is survived by a lovely wife and daughters, who we will continue to hold in our prayers as they deal with this great loss. They and all of Winston's friends, not to be men- tioning the entire wheat industry, are enor- mously proud of what Winston accomplished in his life. We have many fond\u00d0and often times amusing\u00d0memories of our time with Winston and we will always treasure those thoughts. For those of us who are left behind, even the longest life of a loved one seems too short. So, in instances such as this untimely death, it is impossible not to feel cheated out of many years which we had hoped to share. We feel a great loss this week but we also celebrate the life Winston Wilson lived. He will remain in our hearts, thoughts and prayers. /fdash CONCERN OVER SAFETY HON. FORTNEY PETE STARK OFCALIFORNIA INTHE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ex- press my grave concern over the safety of medical devices and the effectiveness of gov- ernment agencies directed to protect the pub- lic from unsafe products. We have all read stories in the newspapers about drugs that have been recalled because they were rushed to market without adequate testing. Many crit- ics of our current policies argue that we have put the profit motive ahead of the health and well being of patients. I agree and have yet another example that the system may have failed to protect the health of patients. Ethicon is a subsidiary of Johnson & John- son and makes surgical equipment. It is the nation's largest manufacturer of sutures used for deep tissue surgeries. In 1994, Ethicon re- called over 3.5 million boxes of its Vicryl su- tures because the sutures may have been contaminated during the manufacturing proc- ess. What I find especially disturbing about this episode is how the company and FDA re- sponded to the problem.Early in 1994, Ethicon began to use a new sterilization process for its sutures. Shortly thereafter, the company discovered that sev- eral batches were contaminated. The com- pany decided to resterilize these sutures and then distribute them on the market. This prac- tice continued for several months. Eventually, Ethicon stopped using the new procedure and switched to other sterilization techniques. Dur- ing this time, Ethicon officials never contacted FDA to report the problem it was having with the sterilizer. Indeed, the FDA did not discover the problem until it conducted one of its rou- tine inspections. These routine inspections occur once every two to three years. The FDA did send a Warning Letter to Ethicon citing significant deviations from Good Manufacturing Practices. By September, Ethicon decided to recall the sutures it had produced. In other words, many months passed between the initial problems with the sterilization procedure and eventual recall. I can only speculate what would have hap- pened, or not happened, if the FDA had not caught the problems with the sterilizer. The next sequence of events is what I really find troubling. Ethicon issued its recall accord- ing to FDA regulations. However, the letter of the law requires only that Ethicon contact dis- tributors and hospitals, not the surgeons who use the sutures. This means that surgeons across the nation were performing operations and using sutures that were subject to a na- tional recall. While Ethicon followed the letter of the law, I would think that a corporation dedicated to the health of patients would have take a more aggressive stance to ensure that its sutures would be removed from supply rooms and surgical kits. According to FDA documents only 2% of the suspect sutures were recovered in the recall. Somehow, leaving 98% of the suspect sutures on the market and unaccounted for seemed to be acceptable to the FDA. They considered the recall completed and closed in June of 1995. Since 1994, over 100 cases of severe post- operative infections have occurred in patients who claim that the infection was due to con- taminated sutures. Lance Williams of the San Francisco Examiner has written a series of ar- ticles (2/21/1999 & 2/22/1999) describing the pain and suffering that these people experi- enced. Ethicon has settled many of these cases out of court with exceptionally strong confidentiality requirements. Because the records are sealed, we cannot determine the potential threat to public health by examining the details of the cases. We may never know with certainty whether the sutures were contaminated and lead to the postoperative infections. According to a letter from the FDA, ``Since typically, 20 units are tested per batch, the finding of ten units were positive results is not conclusive. It is difficult to conclude whether these results mean that the sutures were contaminated or that con- tamination occurred during the testing.'' Even more amazing is the fact that Ethicon destroyed all the sutures recovered in the re- call. Therefore, we cannot know if the recalled sutures were contaminated or sterile. Our constituents depend upon sound federal regulation to protect them from harm. Few of us have the technical expertise to determine which drugs are safe to treat what ails us or the ability to know how we may be infected by contaminated surgical devices. Rather, weCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0Extensions of Remarks E1043 must depend upon a sound system of checks and oversight to ensure that the medicines and tools our physicians use are good and will not harm us. In addition, corporations that make their money selling health products have the moral and ethical obligation to take every precaution to protect consumers. /fdash A TRIBUTE TO HENRY T. BRAUCHLE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL: RECIPIENT OF THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL AWARD HON. CHARLES A. GONZALEZ OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. GONZALEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my sincerest congratulations to Henry T. Brauchle Elementary School in San Anto- nio, TX, upon the notification of their receipt of the Blue Ribbon School Award. Schools are awarded the Blue Ribbon School Award based on their performance in regard to several criteria, including: student focus and support; active teaching and learn- ing; school organization and culture; chal- lenging standards and curriculum; professional community; leadership and educational vitality; school, family, and community partnerships; and indicators of success. Henry T. Brauchle Elementary School joins three schools in San Antonio and forty other Texas schools, all of which excelled in these areas and were rewarded with the Blue Rib- bon School Award from the United States De- partment of Education. To receive consideration for this prestigious award, schools must be recommended for na- tional recognition by their individual state de- partment of education or sponsoring agency. Nominations are then evaluated by a National Review Panel including the Department of Education, the Department of Defense, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Council for Amer- ican Private Education and a select group of educators from around the country. The Sec- retary of Education then makes a final deter- mination based on the recommendations of this panel. In receiving this special recognition, I be- lieve that Henry T. Brauchle Elementary School will inspire others to provide the level of quality education that this Blue Ribbon School Award merits. I am proud to represent a district and hail from a state that has clearly placed an emphasis on the education of our children. /fdash EDUCATION REFORM IN JULESBURG, COLORADO HON. BOB SCHAFFER OF COLORADO INTHE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. SCHAFFER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to the House of Representatives about the education reforms implemented by the Julesburg School District in Julesburg, Colorado. The district's common sense re- forms emphasize personal initiative, account-ability, high standards and responsiveness. I offer a recent letter for the R ECORD, submitted to me by Mr. Rod Blunck, Superintendent of Schools. Julesburg's no-nonsense, no-excuses ap- proach to raising test scores has several steps. First, the salary schedule is based en- tirely on professional development. This incen- tive for personal initiative and improvement has a direct bearing on classroom quality. In the near future, the system will be enhanced to include extra compensation opportunities based on student achievement. Secondly, the responsibility for student achievement is carried out by everyone in the organization, not just the teachers. Their goal, as a staff, is to become a results-oriented or- ganization in which everyone has responsi- bility for the outcome. Thirdly, the District is strengthening its ac- countability to the community by developing school report cards and community presen- tations. I would like to summarize with a quote taken from Superintendent Blunck's letter. The letter quotes author Robert Greenleaf, ``Great ideas, it has been said, come into the world as gently as doves. Perhaps then, if we listen at- tentively, we shall hear, amid the uproar of empires and nations, a faint flutter of wings, the gentle stirring of life and hope.'' Accountability is a popular by-word today, yet few are willing to put this concept to the test. In Northeast Colorado, far from Denver, far from the noisy rancor of Washington, far from the proposals and speeches, there are people who are making a difference with quiet confidence.

DEAR CONGRESSMAN SCHAFFER : I recently had the pleasure of hearing you speak to a group of people in Julesburg during your re- cess. I was a member of the audience that day and I wanted to take a minute to tell you that I look forward to your leadership in the educational arena and I anticipate great possibilities for education under your admin- istration. As I listened to you that day it is my understanding that you are the type of leader and congressman who would appre- ciate what I am about to share with you. I would like to bring it to your attention that a number of the reforms that you spoke of on that day are already being imple- mented in the Julesburg School District. First of all, we do not have the traditional vertical/horizontal salary schedule that is used by most districts in the State. Our schedule is entirely based upon professional development. Within the past year, we have implemented the Julesburg Professional De- velopment Academy where teachers can take professional growth classes that in turn have a direct effect upon their salary and that are specifically directed at increased student achievement. This allows us, as a district, to tailor the classes that teachers take to in- sure that the requested courses correlate with our District goals of improved student achievement. Some of the courses that have been and will be offered through this pro- gram are: Teaching reading and Writing in the con- tent area Using the computer to enhance instruction The Colorado Writing Project Working with Special Needs students in the regular classroom Standards and Assessments\u00d0How do they affect the classroom teacherAs a result of these courses we have seen veteran teachers begin to write rubrics for their students in areas such as science, in- dustrial arts and other curricular areas. With this type of staff development teachers have a direct responsibility for their salary increases and we as a district are able to de- termine what classes and professional growth opportunities align with our District goals. I also wanted to let you know that I have had initial discussion with our teacher rep- resentatives about extra compensation op- portunities based on student achievement scores. We have already determined that we will be a data-driven, result-oriented organi- zation that is willing to compensate teach- ing staff for increased student achievement. I anticipate that this program will be fully funded and implemented for the 00\u00b101 school year. As an example, of our goal of being a result oriented organization I would like to take a minute to share with you an incident that happened after we received the results of the CSAP testing. After receiving the results we noticed that we had declined 25% in reading and 33% in writing from the previous year. Given these known facts we wrote a remedi- ation plan to help us improve our scores. Our remediation included two clauses that I would like to bring to your attention. The first being that, ``we would offer no excuses.'' We would not discuss the test, its norming samples nor the socio-economic status of our children taking the test. In essence we ac- cepted full responsibility for our results. The second caveat that I would like for you to know is that the remediation plan included the Superintendent of Schools and the Board of Education. Thus, to reiterate your point in your speech, in the Julesburg School Dis- trict Re-1 accountability for student achievement is placed upon the entire orga- nization not just the classroom teacher. In fact, our remediation plan is a public docu- ment that is open for our constituents to view. In Julesburg, Colorado, student achievement is the very crux of our account- ability and our decision-making processes. We will not just collect data; our future will be driven by it. Our next step of this accountability proc- ess is the development of a local report card. In addition to printing and publishing our local report card we are going to hold a pub- lic local ``shareholders'' meeting. At this meeting we will furnish to our community a ``state of the school'' presentation. This presentation will include fiscal information as well as student achievement information. It is our intention that this ``shareholder'' meeting will become a tradition in the Julesburg community. Congressman Schaffer, I share this infor- mation with you because people with shared goals should communicate to maximize the positive effect for our students. As I close, I would like to share a quote with you. Robert Greenleaf, in his book Servant Leadership cites the following passage, ``Great ideas, it has been said, come into the world as gently as doves. Perhaps then, if we listen atten- tively, we shall hear, amid the uproar of em- pires and nations, a faint flutter of wings, the gentle stirring of life and hope.'' Con- gressman, you and I both know that the fu- ture of education is very bright in Colorado. If I can be of any assistance to you in our shared purpose please feel free to call on me. Sincerely, RODL. B LUNCK , Superintendent of Schools.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0Extensions of Remarks E1044 May 20, 1999 HONORING COMMUNITY PROTES- TANT CHURCH OF CO-OP CITY HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, a church can be the mainstay of a community, the bond which holds its people together in common purpose. In the Bronx, the Co-op City community is for- tunate to have such a church, the Community Protestant Church of Co-op City. And today I rise to congratulate that won- derful institution and its worshippers who are celebrating the church's 30th anniversary. The Community Protestant Church started humbly enough with the organizational meet- ing of co-operators, as residents of Co-op City are called, in the spring of 1969. Initially serv- ices were held in the homes on a rotating basis before moving to a community room. Visiting ministers were provided by the Council of Churches on a weekly basis. The following year Temple Beth-El shared its space with the Church and the Rev. Julius Sasportas volun- teered to serve as pastor. It was on March 21, 1971, that the church was officially incorporated. That same year the church acquired and renovated space at 2053 Asch Loop North and in May of the following year moved into its new quarters. In Decem- ber, 1972, the Rev. Daniel Ward was sent by the Southern Baptist Convention to serve as Pastor. In the following years more space was ac- quired and in 1976 the Rev. Dr. Calvin E. Owens became the spiritual leader of the church. New land was acquired for a perma- nent home and in November 3, 1994, groundbreaking ceremonies were held. I congratulate the Community Protestant Church on its 30th anniversary and wish the church many more years in the community. /fdash IN HONOR OF ST. JOSEPH WORSHIP SPACE HON. DENNIS J. KUCINICH OF OHIO INTHE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the dedication of the St. Joseph Wor- ship Space. The Worship Space is an environment where, through private devotion and liturgical celebration, the sisters of St. Joseph may be united with God and with one another. The Worship Space provides the congregation with a much-needed facility where the sisters of St. Joseph and the community can gather to wor- ship. A Reservation Chapel has been set up for the use of private devotion to the Blessed Sacrament. The Reconciliation Chapel has been built and is dedicated for the reception of the Sacrament of Reconciliation. Also, seating for 250 people is available for liturgy, meet- ings, jubilees, Chapter assemblies, and, a gathering room has been established where the sisters can meet as well as extend their hospitality to the congregation. My fellow colleagues, please join me hon- oring the dedication of the Sisters of St. Jo- seph Worship Space.TRIBUTE TO REV. RICHARD ANDRUS HON. DAVID E. BONIOR OF MICHIGAN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. BONIOR. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to congratulate, Rev. Richard Andrus upon his retirement from the ministry. His parish- ioners, colleagues, family and friends will honor him with a retirement dinner at the First United Methodist Church in Mount Clemens, MI. Born in Reese, MI, in 1937, Reverend Andrus has dedicated much of his life to serv- ing others. He entered the ministry in 1967, and has been a leader in nine different churches throughout his exemplary career. Currently, Reverend Andrus serves at the First United Methodist Church in Mount Clemens. He has been with the church for 7 years. Prior to his arrival at First United Methodist Church in Mount Clemens, Reverend Andrus served in several area churches, including the Warren First United Methodist Church and the Warren Wesley Church. Prior to that, he was assigned to the New Baltimore Congregation and built the Grace United Methodist Church. Reverend Andrus is a tireless advocate for the people of Macomb County. He formed the Macomb County Ministerium and has been a member of the Macomb Emergency Shelter Coalition for the last 10 years. Reverend Andrus is also a member of the Jail Ministry, the Healthier Macomb Organization and the Rotary Club. While serving in New Baltimore, he was also the Chaplain for the Civil Air Pa- trol at Selfridge Air Force Base. For more than 32 years, Rev. Richard Andrus has given his time, love and patience to the people he has served. Now, it is my honor to give Reverend Andrus my heartfelt congratulations as he celebrates his retire- ment. /fdash A TRIBUTE TO GLEN OAKS ELE- MENTARY SCHOOL; RECIPIENT OF THE UNITED STATES DE- PARTMENT OF EDUCATION BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL AWARD HON. CHARLES A. GONZALEZ OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. GONZALEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my sincerest congratulations to Glen Oaks Elementary School in San Antonio, TX, upon the notification of their receipt of the Blue Ribbon School Award. Schools are awarded the Blue Ribbon School Award based on their performance in regards to several criteria, including: student focus and support; active teaching and learn- ing; school organization and culture; chal- lenging standard and curriculum; professional community; leadership and educational vitality; school, family, and community partnerships; and indicators of success. Glen Oaks Elementary joins three other schools in San Antonio and forty other Texas schools, all of which excelled in these areas and were rewarded with the Blue Ribbon School Award from the United States Depart- ment of Education.To receive consideration for this prestigious award, schools must be recommended for na- tional recognition by their individual state de- partment of education or sponsoring agency. Nominations are then evaluated by a National Review Panel including the Department of Education, the Department of Defense, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Council for Amer- ica Private Education and a select group of educators from around the country. The Sec- retary of Education then makes a final deter- mination based on the recommendations of this panel. In receiving this special recognition, I be- lieve that Glen Oaks Elementary School will inspire others to provide the level of quality education that this Blue Ribbon School Award merits. I am proud to represent a district and hail from a state that has clearly placed an emphasis on the education of our children. /fdash EDUCATION REFORM, A RURAL PERSPECTIVE HON. BOB SCHAFFER OF COLORADO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. SCHAFFER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Gerald Keefe, Superintendent of Kit Carson School District R\u00b11 and a mem- ber of my Fourth Congressional District Edu- cation Advisory Board. I would like to enter into the R ECORDa recent letter from him on education reform. Superintendent Keefe's common sense ideas emphasize the importance of basic val- ues, including respect for elders, peers, teach- ers and community. Creating a school culture which affirms values is central not only to the success of the school but to the stability of so- ciety. To generate an environment of respect, schools should adopt high standards and good discipline measures. Secondly, Superintendent Keefe stresses the need for local control. He believes cutting federal red tape to ensure money gets to the classroom is essential. Streamlining regula- tions, especially those revolving around the In- dividuals with Disabilities Act is also necessary to ensure each child gets the attention he or she needs to achieve. I look forward to working with Super- intendent Keefe as the Committee on Edu- cation and Workforce, of which I am a mem- ber, undertakes the reauthorization of the Ele- mentary and Secondary Education Act, the primary source of education funding. I would like to finish with a quote from au- thor Robert Greenleaf: ``Great ideas, it has been said, come into the world as gently as doves. Perhaps then, if we listen attentively, we shall hear, amid the uproar of empires and nations, a faint flutter of wings, the gentle stir- ring of life and hope.'' In rural Colorado, far from Denver, far from the noisy rancor of Washington, far from the proposals and speeches, there are people who are making a difference with quiet con- fidence. KITCARSON SCHOOL DISTRICT R \u00b11, Kit Carson, CO. Congressman B OBSCHAFFER , Cannon House Office Building, Washington, DC. DEARCONGRESSMAN SCHAFFER , First let me commend you on the outstanding job you areCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0Extensions of Remarks E1045 doing in reforming public education. It's a tough task as you know and I admire your efforts. I was intrigued by the findings of the Edu- cation at a Crossroads report that high- lighted characteristics of successful schools. I wholeheartedly agreed with that report and I would like to briefly touch on those find- ings and offer a few other comments as well. Please understand that I offer a rural per- spective on education and as such my back- ground and feelings may differ from those of my urban colleagues. Rural Coloradans crave technology and would welcome any legisla- tion that increases opportunities in that area for small districts. Technology of course comes with a price tag, but the return on the investment in this area makes it an acceptable cost. The SLC Universal Service Discount has been helpful but other funding opportunities would be welcomed as well. I applaud your efforts to directly deliver dollars to the classroom instead of seeing a large portion of those funds siphoned off by the bureaucracy. You are most certainly on the right track in this area. Schools also desperately need the ability to instill basic values in their populace. Re- spect for ones' elders, country, teachers, fel- low students and school community are in my mind essential not only for successful schools but for a stable society as well. Court rulings and legislation restricting the rights of schools to discipline and set stand- ards for their students have improved some- what over the years, but more progress is still needed in this area. Schools must be administered at the local level and even though I welcome federal funding from the budget side of the equation, that enthusiasm is tempered by the knowl- edge that increased federal control may also result from this arrangement. Special Education is another topic of great concern. I feel that it has become a trap that students often do not return from. It needs to be streamlined so that the classification of students with disabilities is a true and ac- curate one and not just a convenient label to explain away juvenile behavior. My Catholic school background tells me that some of these students need a paddle against their backside and not a protective label that provides a ready made excuse to justify anti-social behavior. IDEA legislation should be written to ensure that only those who have a significant need for special edu- cation services actually qualify. We are pleased, however, with the Title One pro- gram and how it operates in our district. Vocational Education has the potential to offer a wide variety of opportunities for rural America and as such I ask that continued funding of those programs remain a priority. After I familiarize myself with specific topics facing Congress through your Ed-Link publication I would be willing to comment on those issues in greater detail. I feel I have spoken today in a very broad sense but I hope my comments are still of some value to you as you tackle the challenges facing America's schools. Thanks for your time and effort on behalf of the citizens of House District 4 and thanks again for the opportunity to serve on your education advisory committee. Sincerely, GERALD KEEFE , Superintendent.HONORING JUDGE ASCHER KATZ HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak in praise of a man who has devoted himself to his community. Judge Ascher Katz is not only Administrative Town Judge of Greenburgh, serving on the bench for 23 years, but a man who has immersed himself in the judicial profession as a Director of the County Magistrates Association and as a Chairman of the state Bar Association Com- mittee on District, City, Village and Town Courts. Judge Katz is also in Who's Who in Amer- ican Law and a senior partner in his law firm. But he also serves the community as a whole; as a Charter Member of the U.S. Holocaust Commission, in the Jewish War Veterans, as a board member of the American Cancer So- ciety, and in the Rotary and B'nai B'rith. He is a graduate of Harvard Law School and he and his wife have three daughters. On his retire- ment I want to thank him for all he has done for his community and to wish him the very best. /fdash IN HONOR OF THE LADIES AUXIL- IARY OF THE POLISH LEGION OF AMERICAN VETERANS HON. DENNIS J. KUCINICH OF OHIO INTHE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 65th Anniversary of Chapter No. 30, The Ladies Auxiliary of the Polish Legion of American Veterans. Organized on May 23, 1934, The Ladies Auxiliary of the Polish Legion of American Vet- erans was formed to work with the Post, visit the hospitalized veterans and to participate in all patriotic, civil and religious functions. Throughout the past 65 years, the Ladies Auxiliary has worked hard for the veterans of Chapter 30 of the Polish Legion by partici- pating in many activities, such as, parades, Memorial Masses, Civil functions, and ward treats at Wade Park and Brecksville V.A. Hos- pitals. This Chapter has also been involved with State and National Conversions, Veterans and Women of the Year, Evening in Warsaw, State Picnic, Night at the Races and Bowling Tournaments. The Ladies Auxiliary is dedicated to raising money to support veterans by holding fund raisers such as, Card Parties, Bingo's, Din- ners, Picnics, Bake Sales, and Poppy sales. Throughout their years of service of helping veterans, Chapter No. 30 has accumulated over 35,000 registered volunteer hours. The members of the Chapter are proud of their Polish Heritage and culture and proud to have accomplished so much in the past 65 years. I am confident that the Polish Legion of American Veterans Ladies Auxiliary will con- tinue their commitment to work for the vet- erans well in to the next millennium. My fellow colleagues, please join me in hon- oring the work and dedication of The Ladies Auxiliary of the Polish Legion of American Vet- erans.IN CELEBRATION OF REV. MSGR. GERARD LA CERRA HON. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART OF FLORIDA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a man who has devoted his life to God and who has served faithfully as a priest for 30 years. Reverend Monsignor was born on March 12, 1943, and was ordained to the priesthood on May 24, 1969, after completing his seminary studies at St. John Vianney Col- lege Seminary in Miami and St. Vincent de Paul Regional Seminary in Boynton Beach, FL. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts, Master of Divinity, Master of Theology and Doctor of Sa- cred Theology. His many ecclesiastical achievements began in 1969 when he was Regional Coordi- nator for Religious Education in Broward County. From 1970 to 1977 he was Director of the MA Program in Religious Studies. A mem- ber of the Faculty of St. Vincent de Paul Re- gional Seminary from 1972 to 1974, he was also Secretary of the National Conference of Diocesan Directors of Religious Education from 1974 to 1978. In 1978 he was appointed Chancellor of the Archdiocese of Miami and served in that ca- pacity until 1993. In addition, he was ap- pointed Vicar General and Moderator of the Curia in 1984, a position in which he served until March 1995. In this capacity he served as Executive Director of the Ministry of General Services. Besides membership on various Archdiocesan boards and commissions, he is also Chaplain to the Daughters of Isabella. At a Pastoral level, Msgr. La Cerra was As- sociate Pastor at Annunciation, Little Flower (Coral Gables) and St. James Parishes. From 1978 until May 15, 1991 he was named Pas- tor of St. Mary's Cathedral. In December of 1992 he was appointed ad- ministrator of St. Timothy Parish in Miami and currently he holds the Pastoral position. He was given the title of Reverend Monsignor by the highest authority of the Catholic Church, Pope John Paul II, in September of 1995. We are fortunate to have this admirable Monsignor in South Florida and I commend Reverend La Cerra for his many accomplishments. /fdash IN SUPPORT OF THE SCHOOL ANTI-VIOLENCE EMPOWERMENT ACT HON. GENE GREEN OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, juvenile crime today tends to be more violent and in- volves younger children than in the past. The recent tragedies involving school violence has prompted parents, teachers, administrators, and elected officials to work together and set the safety of our children as a national priority. Congress needs to get its priorities in line as well and act on legislation that would stop youth violence and make our schools safe. According to a 1995 GAO report on school- based violence prevention programs, success- ful programs have the following characteris- tics: a comprehensive approach; an early startCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0Extensions of Remarks E1046 May 20, 1999 and long-term commitment; strong leadership and disciplinary policies; staff development; parental involvement; interagency partnerships and community links; and a culturally sensitive and developmentally appropriate approach. I am proud to join my colleague from New Jersey, Congressman R OBERTMENENDEZ as a cosponsor of the School Anti-Violence Em- powerment Act because it includes many of the recommendations of the GAO report. This bill would: Provide grants for school districts to hire cri- sis prevention counselors and fund anti-school violence initiatives. 50% of the grants would go to fund crisis prevention counselors and crisis prevention programs. 50% would go to school districts who would have the flexibility to spend these funds on projects which would best improve security at their schools. Increased funding for COPS. 50% of the funding would be targeted for cooperative school-police partnerships to place safety offi- cers in schools. Implements after school and life skills pro- grams for at-risk youth. Directs the Department of Education to work with the Department of Justice to develop a model violence prevention program for school districts to use. In addition, the Department of Education would create a clearinghouse of anti-school violence to allow school districts to see what types of initiatives are working in other schools across the nation. It is imperative that we implement aggres- sive and comprehensive approaches to keep our children safe. They deserve to have an educational experience free from fear or the threat of violence. /fdash LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION MONTH HON. ALLEN BOYD OF FLORIDA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. BOYD. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor of Law Enforcement Appreciation Month to pay tribute to our nation's more than 700,000 men and women who serve our com- munities as law enforcement officers. We owe these individuals a tremendous debt of grati- tude for the many sacrifices they make so that we might enjoy safer places to live and work. Each day, America's law enforcement offi- cers put their lives on the line as our first de- fense from violent crime. But these public servants do so much more than apprehend criminals: law enforcement officers are com- munity activists, role models for our nation's young people and defenders of law and order. This month, in honor of Law Enforcement Appreciation Month, I hope that Americans will take time to thank their local law enforcement officers for their dedication and hard work. We should also take this moment to remember the ultimate sacrifice made by the many officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty and pay our respects to the families these individ- uals have left behind. Most importantly, as this month comes to a close, we should strive to honor these brave officers each day and give them our support so that together we might make our communities an even better place to live.CONGRATULATING LEON MED- VEDOW ON HIS 70TH BIRTHDAY HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO OF CONNECTICUT IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to recognize Leon Medvedow as he celebrates his 70th birthday. This evening friends, family, and the New Haven community will gather to pay tribute to Leon for a lifetime of contributions to the City of New Haven. A respected leader of the community, Leon has served the City of New Haven and its residents with an unparalleled commitment for over fifty years. His distinguished record of public service began with his election as New Haven's Old Third Ward Alderman in 1953. For decades, Leon continued his leadership and vision for New Haven in many other ca- pacities including City Clerk, Chairman of the Board of Finance, and Chairman of the 25th Ward Democratic Committee. Leon was honored by former President Jimmy Carter with an appointment to the Fed- eral Small Business Administration Advisory Council in recognition of his professionalism as a small business owner. Today he remains president of Leon A. Medvedow & Associates, Inc., a printing company he built from the ground up, and continues his political career as Campaign General Chairman for New Ha- ven's current mayor, John DeStefano, Jr. His exceptional talents remain focused on the im- provement of the New Haven community. The generosity Leon has shown throughout his life has made him a true friend to the com- munity. He gives his seemingly endless time and energy to many community organizations. Currently, he is a member of Congregation Beth El-Keser Israel as well as the Board of Directors for the New Haven Jewish Commu- nity Center, overseeing a myriad of social pro- grams for New Haven's Jewish community. He is a former trustee of the University of Con- necticut's Alumni Association and a founder and past president of the UCONN Club. An avid basketball fan, he is a fifty year veteran basketball season ticket holder showing true loyalty and spirit for his alma mater. His pas- sion for the sport led him to sponsor a local team, the New Haven Elms, bringing the game he loves to the City of New Haven. After five decades of accomplishments, you wouldn't think Leon would have anything left to achieve and yet he continues to add to his extraordinary life. Just five days ago, Leon celebrated his Bar Mitzvah, fulfilling a promise he made to himself over fifty years ago when circumstances forced the ceremony to fall by the wayside. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise today to join Leon's wife, Phyllis, children, grandchildren, friends, and the entire New Haven community to wish my good friend a very happy 70th birthday. Leon's work and commitment have truly left this community a better place and for that we thank him.TAIWAN'S 3RD ANNIVERSARY OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS HON. TERRY EVERETT OF ALABAMA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. EVERETT. Mr. Speaker, for the first time in Chinese history, Taiwan held a truly democratic presidential election three years ago. As the people of Taiwan celebrate their president's third anniversary in office on May 20, 1999, I send them my congratulations. I applaud President Lee's recent proposal that Taiwan and the mainland work together in drafting a comprehensive financial plan to help solve the current financial crisis affecting their neighbors in Asia. President Lee's innovative ideas deserve serious consideration by the mainland China authorities. The Chinese people as well as the inter- national Community, stand to benefit if Taiwan and China continue to have a meaningful dia- logue about their hopeful unification. Taiwan and the Chinese mainland have much to learn from each other. Taiwan's economic miracle and a thriving democracy will be a useful guide to the mainland China's progress toward a free and open economic and political cli- mate. Congratulations to President Lee Teng-hui and best regards to Foreign Minister Jason Hu for their effort on behalf of democracy in the Pacific Rim. /fdash IN HONOR OF BELVA DAVIS AND ROLLIN POST HON. NANCY PELOSI OFCALIFORNIA HON. BARBARA LEE OFCALIFORNIA HON. LYNN C. WOOLSEY OFCALIFORNIA INTHE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, we rise today to mark the contributions of two highly respected California journalists. On Sunday, May 23, 1999, veteran Bay Area television journalists Belva Davis and Rollin Post will be honored at the San Francisco City Hall Rotunda. Their combined experience spans 70 years, a long and rich engagement with the social, cultural, and political history of the Bay Area. Belva Davis, winner of multiple professional awards, has worked continuously on television since 1966, when she became the first Afri- can-American female reporter on the West Coast. Since that breakthrough, Belva has contributed significantly to the shape and the texture of today's television news. Her sharp, poignant reports stimulate community aware- ness. Her commitment is further demonstrated by deep involvement in numerous community organizations. She is also a labor activist and a visible supporter of African-American culture and history. During her career, Belva Davis has reported for, or anchored, such public affairs programs as KRON's ``California This Week'' with as News CentersCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0Extensions of Remarks E1047 4's anchor and urban affairs specialist. Most recently, she joined Congresswoman Barbara Lee's citizen delegation to report a week-long series on the people, culture and politics of Cuba and on Cuba's relationship with the United States. Belva has received six local Emmys, the 1996 Governor's Award of the Northern Cali- fornia Chapter of the National Academy of Tel- evision Arts and Sciences, a Certificate of Ex- cellence from the California Associated Press Television and Radio Association, and the Golden Gadfly Award of the Media Alliance. She has honorary doctorates from Golden Gate University and John F. Kennedy Univer- sities. The Media Academy of Oakland offers an annual journalism scholarship in Ms. Davis's name. When Rollin Post announced his retirement, Belva said: ``I've been learning from Rollin Post for three decades, and we have become the real political odd couple. He has taught me how to make the most complicated political issues interesting to a sometimes disinterested electorate.'' Rollin Post has covered politics in the San Francisco Bay Area for more than 40 years. With keen understanding of public affairs, Rollin has covered 14 national political con- ventions. In addition to state and local political issues, Rollin reported from Cuba in 1978 on trade, tourism, and hijacking. In 1986, Rollin was on special assignment in the Philippines during the transition to democracy. ``Rollin is an old-fashioned reporter who gives you the facts and is genuinely interested in the process, the politics, the issues and ideas. He is exceptionally fair-minded and doesn't have a cynical bone in his body,'' wrote John Jacobs, political editor of McClatchy Newspapers. With a passion for politics, along with a touch of idealism, Rollin brought clarity and understanding to the polit- ical process. Early in his career, Rollin worked for KPIX\u00b1 TV, where he concentrated on politics and general assignments. He was also head writer and producer for ``The Paul Coates Report,'' a nationally syndicated television interview show. Rollin joined KQED in 1973 to work on three programs: ``A Closer Look,'' ``News- room,'' and ``California Tonight.'' In 1979, Rollin joined KRON\u00b1TV, where he served as NewsCenter4's political editor for 18 years. While co-anchoring on KRON's ``Cali- fornia This Week.'' Rollin and Belva brought passion and insight to the issues of the day. Because of their pioneering spirit and leader- ship, Rollin and Belva became mentors to the next generation of journalists. Rollin speaks of Belva with great affection: ``She's a Type A; I'm the type who likes to take naps.'' Currently, Rollin hosts ``Our World This Week,'' an international news show produced by BayTV in cooperation with the World Affairs Council of Northern California. Among his many awards, Rollin received the prestigious Broadcast Preceptor Award from the 32nd annual San Francisco State University Broadcast Industry Conference. He has also been honored by the Coro Founda- tion for his influential leadership in the public arena. In celebrating the lives and careers of Belva Davis and Rollins Post, we are paying tribute to two remarkable people whom we are also fortunate to know as friends.A TRIBUTE TO CITY YEAR SAN ANTONIO HON. CHARLES A. GONZALEZ OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. GONZALEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask unanimous consent to submit into the RECORDan article that appeared in the San Antonio Express News recently. The article highlights City Year San Antonio, a unique public and private partnership pro- gram for the national service movement. City Year San Antonio has contributed more than 30,000 hours of service to the San Antonio community in its 3 years of service. City Year San Antonio has established a mentor and tutor program for children from elementary school through high school, including pro- grams on the environment, domestic violence prevention, HIV/Aids awareness, and tech- nology education. I am proud of the work and the service that City Year provides to the San Antonio commu- nity. I look forward to the continued success and future progress of City Year San Antonio. AMERICORPS WORKERS HELPING OTHERS CITYWIDE (By Joseph Barrios) . .. Nathan Miller grew up in a quiet Kan- sas City, Kan., neighborhood but wanted to travel and learn about different places. He graduated from high school and then applied to serve with City Year, one of the AmeriCorps volunteer programs operating in San Antonio. The 19-year-old Miller now works 12-hour days, sometimes tutoring West Side children as part of Project Learn to Read and some- times working with San Antonio Alternative Housing on minor construction for elderly neighbors. His favorite responsibility is helping teach a nighttime English class for adults seeking citizenship. ``I feel like I help them get along better in their lives,'' Miller said, ``I have a chance to meet people in drastically different life situ- ations from mine.'' Miller is one of more than 140 full-time volunteers in the San Antonio area serving with various AmeriCorps programs. Al- though the volunteers are affiliated with dif- ferent funding agencies, their goals are the same. They want to tackle some of San Antonio's blight and improve people's lives. AmeriCorps is the national service program started by Congress and President Clinton in 1993. Programs can be funded with federal dollars or matched by a local ``parent'' orga- nization. The George Gervin Youth Center has 20 full-time AmeriCorps volunteers and Habitat for Humanity has a dozen full-time volun- teers working in San Antonio. Miller works for the 10-year-old City Year program, which has 70 AmeriCorps volun- teers and works out of an office downtown. An average day for h im varies somewhat from Rudy Beltran, 23, a full-time volunteer with the Just Serve AmeriCorps program run by San Antonio Fighting Back of the United Way. Beltran, based at the Barbara Jordan cen- ter of the city's East Side, is a full-time stu- dent at the University of Texas at San Anto- nio. He also teaches an evening, English-as- a-Second-Language class at Highlands High School and tutors high school students in English. Recently, Beltran helped several students prepare for the Texas Assessment of Aca- demic Skills Test. ``I definitely get a lot out of it,'' Beltran said. ``A couple of students came up to meand said it really helped them. They thought they had passed it.'' Fighting Back, a substance abuse, crime and violence prevention and community de- velopment program, has 60 full-time volun- teers. They are recruiting more than 100 high school students for a new part-time service program in San Antonio. City Year and Southside High School re- cently started a part-time volunteer pro- gram for students called City Heroes. Most of the full-time volunteers started their year of service in August and will fin- ish in June. Volunteers operate primarily on the city's West, East and South sides but can partici- pate in programs anywhere in the city, said Scott Hirsch of the Texas Commission on Volunteerism and Community Service. Vol- unteers themselves come from all areas of town and sometimes\u00d0like Miller\u00d0from out of town. Hirsch said the commission is working on guidelines to evaluate how effective volun- teers throughout Texas have been in the past five years since the AmeriCorps program was founded. Overall, the various volunteer pro- grams are going strong. Hirsch added that associations with other programs can cause confusion. ``Sometimes, when you're at a cocktail party and you mention you work for AmeriCorps, people think it no longer exists,'' Hirsch said. Some of the benefits to the program are in- tangible, said Bill Blair, director at the George Gervin Youth Center. Regularly, when volunteers are painting a house or cleaning up an abandoned lot, neighbors will stop by and offer their help. ``I say, `Sure, come on and join us.' You can't beat that sort of thing,'' Blair said. Neighbors can also submit ideas for service projects to any of the programs like City Year or Fighting Back. AmeriCorps volunteer benefits can include health insurance, a weekly stipend, uniforms and a post-service education award of $4,725 that can pay for school or student loans. The program requires a minimum of 1,700 hours a year from volunteers. This fall, Miller will begin college in Vermont. He said his favorite times as a vol- unteer come when someone thanks him for work that an AmeriCorps volunteer did. ``I have people come up to me all the time. They see your shirt and want to thank you,'' Miller said. ``They can be thanking you for something that happened three years or three days ago.'' /fdash WORKING ON A SOLUTION HON. BOB SCHAFFER OF COLORADO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. SCHAFFER. Mr. Speaker, in the matter of the Columbine Massacre, I hereby submit to the R ECORDa statement issued by the Col- orado State Board of Education. These remarks, I commend to my col- leagues upon consideration of various pro- posals pending this Congress. Clearly, the thoughts offered by the Colorado State Board of Education, signed a thoughtful approach to any legislative initiatives we might consider here and establish a reasonable framework from which to view our responsibilities. The statement of the Board is as follows: WHATISTOBEDONE: SEARCHING FOR MEANING INOURTRAGEDY In the aftermath of the most terrible day in Colorado education, when the pain andCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0Extensions of Remarks E1048 May 20, 1999 grief of those who have suffered loss is be- yond what words can express, all of us are asking the questions: ``Why? How did this happen? What can we do to keep it from hap- pening again?'' The State Board of Edu- cation, adhering to its Constitutional re- sponsibility, joins the Columbine community and the rest of the State in seeking the les- sons that may be drawn from the awful trag- edy of April 20, 1999. As we seek the why behind this infamous event, we must find answers beyond the easy and obvious. How weapons become used for outlaw purposes is assuredly a relevant issue, yet our society's real problem is how human behavior sinks to utter and depraved indifference to the sanctity of life. As our country promotes academic literacy, we must promote moral literacy as well, and it is not children, but adults in authority who are ultimately responsible for that. Our tragedy is but the latest\u00d0albeit the most terrifying and costly\u00d0of a steadily es- calating series of schoolhouse horrors that have swept across the nation. The senseless brutality of these calamities clearly reveals that a dangerous subculture of amoral vio- lence has taken hold among many of our youth. We cannot pretend that we have not known about this subculture or about those ele- ments of the mass media, from films to video games, from which it derives sustenance. Further, we must honestly admit that essen- tially we have done nothing to prevent these cultural cancers from spreading through our schools and society. How often have adults questioning highly dubious youth speech, dress, entertainment, or behavior been decried as old-fashioned, or worse, attacked as enemies of individual ex- pression? How often have parents or teachers reporting alarming predictors of violent be- havior been told nothing can be done until someone actually commits a crime? So we do nothing, and then look upon the ruin of so many young lives while hearing those sad- dest of words: Too Late. As a Board we believe, with Edmund Burke, that all that is required for the tri- umph of evil is that good men do nothing. We further believe that society must act now before it is too late for more innocent chil- dren. We also recognize that failing to act shall make us all accomplices in such future tragedies as may engulf our schools. Accordingly, we make the following rec- ommendations for renewing that unity and strength of purpose that has historically bonded our schools, our homes, and our soci- ety. I. IN OUR SCHOOLS While our schools are at once the mold and the mirror of the democratic society they serve, they are not democracies themselves. Schools are founded and controlled by adults for the benefit of children. The adults accountable for running schools must have the courage, ability, and author- ity to establish and maintain a safe and or- derly environment maximally consonant with the purposes of schooling, i.e. the full- est possible achievement for every single child. We recognize that in every time, and every society, there is tension between liberty and license, and frankly, we believe that the pen- dulum has swung too far in the direction of the latter. Be that as it may, our school children should not be routinely victimized by the quarrels of the wider society. They deserve the shielding mantle of adult authority while they form and strengthen themselves for their own entry into adulthood.We also recognize the routine cruelty and torment that can occur among adolescents in an unchecked peer culture. This is all the more reason for a strong and vigilant adult authority to prevent victimization of the vulnerable. We know this won't be easy, and that it must begin with a decisive rollback of those harmful precedents that have so undermined the confident and successful exercise of le- gitimate adult authority upon which every good school depends. We must stop disrespecting those who urge discipline and values. We must recognize that their cry is the legitimate voice of the American people. We must listen to re- spected voices\u00d0liberal and conservative\u00d0 like Albert Shanker and William Bennett\u00d0 when they tell us flat out that our ``easy'' schools will never get better or safer without a massive renewal of their values, discipline, and work ethic. Finally, we must remember, respect, and unashamedly take pride in the fact that our schools, like our country, found their origin and draw their strength from the faith-based morality that is at the heart of our national character. Today our schools have become so fearful of affirming one religion or one value over another that they have banished them all. In doing so they have abdicated their historic role in the moral formation of youth and thereby alienated themselves from our peo- ple's deep spiritual sensibilities. To leave this disconnection between society and its schools and unaddressed is an open invita- tion to further divisiveness and decline. For the sake of our children, who are so depend- ent upon a consistent and unified message from the adult world, we must solve these di- lemmas. Other civilized nations have re- solved divisions that are far more volatile. Surely, America can do as well. II. INOUR HOMES We routinely preach about cooperation be- tween home and school, yet too often our ac- tions tell a different story. Too often, we un- dermine rather than support the values and authority of parents. Too often, we find them handy scapegoats for our own failures. When countless surveys show our parents to be deeply concerned about the state of public education, something is seriously wrong and we ignore this at our peril. This alienation has as much to do with pa- rental concerns about safety and values as it does with persistent learning deficiencies. If we are to ask parents to use their authority to support those educating their children, then educators must use their authority to support the work and values of parents. Some schools are already doing this, but sadly in too many instances, these historic bonds of trust and mutual support have frayed badly or broken altogether. We deeply believe that without a unified adult world, our children will continue to suffer the consequences of our doubts and di- visions. III. IN OUR SOCIETY The connection between murder in our schools and elements of the mass culture is now beyond dispute. Only those who profit from this filth, and their dwindling bands of apologists deny the evidence of violence, ha- tred, and sadism routinely found in films, video games, and the like. We believe it is no longer acceptable for an entertainment industry that spends billions to influence the behavior of children to deny that their efforts have consequences or that they have no accountability for sowing the seeds of tragedy.If a utility poured sewage into our streets, an outraged public would not tolerate it. Should those responsible for the stream of moral sewage entering our homes and com- munities be any less accountable? If we deem it proper to boycott, withhold public investments, and otherwise impose an economic penalty on companies for their labor practices, environmental policies, or countries in which they operate, how could we fail to move at least as aggressively against those who create, promote, and dis- tribute media and other products for which there is no imaginable justification. In closing we should be reminded that throughout our history our people have dem- onstrated a remarkable capacity for moral courage and self-renewal in times of great danger and challenge. Perhaps across the ages we can hear the timeless words of Abraham Lincoln, and, ap- plying them to our own circumstance renew his pledges, ``that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom''. With history as our judge, let us go for- ward together with a strong and active faith.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give tribute and thanks to Stephen Lieb who is retiring as Director of the Northeast Bronx Education Park. For many years he taught our children, before rising to administrative posts in the school district. He was born and raised in New York City, educated in its public schools and has a B.S. from Hunter College, his M.S. from Fordham University and additional graduate work at Pace University and the University of Wash- ington. His initial assignment was teaching science at J.H.S. 163. In 1970 he transferred to I.S. 180 as Science Chairman and he was named Planetarium Director when that facility was completed. Among his accomplishments was the full air conditioning of the five schools in the Park, and the installation of the data communica- tions system. He has worked for 30 years with the Greater New York Council, Boy Scouts of America and takes 30 fatherless boys to camp every year. He also founded a scholarship program. In his retirement as Director of the Education Park, he leaves a hole that will be difficult to fill. I congratulate him for all of his good work and wish him the very best in re- tirement.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0Extensions of Remarks E1049 IN HONOR OF THE SALVATION ARMY HON. DENNIS J. KUCINICH OF OHIO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor The Salvation Army's Harbor Light Complex in the Greater Cleveland area on their 50th Anniversary. The Harbor Light Complex has a strong commitment to helping those in the greater Cleveland area who are less fortunate. Through this institution, programs of Correc- tion, Emergency Sheltering Services, Food Services, New Hope Citadel Corp., Residential Services, as well as Detox & Substance Abuse Programs help people deal with difficul- ties they face and gives them the courage and the tools to fight through them. The Harbor Light Complex continues to pro- vide in its historically established tradition the caring services needed to offer comfort, shel- ter sustenance, education and hope to the Greater Cleveland Community. The Salvation Army's continuing commitment to serving a di- verse group of people in need in the Greater Cleveland area, sets an example of how car- ing individuals can change the world one life at a time. I would like to recognize the Salvation Army's Harbor Light Complex for 50 years of quality service. They have truly met the needs of those who do not have a voice in our com- munity. /fdash INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT FOR THE HEALTH CARE WORKER NEEDLESTICK PREVENTION ACT HON. FORTNEY PETE STARK OF CALIFORNIA INTHE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join with my colleagues, M ARGEROUKEMA, GEORGEMILLER, and R OBANDREWSto intro- duce the Health Care Worker Needlestick Pre- vention Act, a bill to prevent dangerous, costly and preventable needlestick injuries to our na- tion's health care workers. For far too long, we have stood by and watched as health care workers suffer needlestick and sharps injuries in our nation's hospitals and health care system. According to a 1997 report by the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA), approximately 800,000 hospital-based workers are injured annually from accidental needlesticks. Many of those injuries infections from bloodborne dis- eases, the worst of which include HIV/AIDS, and Hepatitis B & C. OSHA estimates that approximately 16,000 needlesticks are contaminated by the HIV/ AIDS. As of December 1998, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) had documented 54 cases of HIV seroconversions from needlesticks and more than 110 ``possible'' cases among U.S. healthcare workers. In ad- dition, according to the International Health Care Worker Safety Center at the University ofVirginia, there are an estimated 18 to 35 new occupational HIV infections of health care workers occurring from accidental needlesticks each year. These injuries are largely preventable through use of newer technologies that use engineering devices to minimize accidental needlesticks. Hundreds of hospitals across the country have already converted to the use of these devices, but there are still thousands that haven't done so. Our legislation would make such safety devices the norm rather than the exception. The Health Care Worker Needlestick Pre- vention Act is modeled after a California state law. Last year, California became the first state in the nation to require needlestick pro- tections. The legislation was signed into law by then-Governor Pete Wilson and was en- dorsed by a wide coalition including the Cali- fornia Health Care Association (the state hos- pital trade association), Kaiser Permanente, health care workers, and labor unions alike. The California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal-OSHA) has esti- mated that each needlestick injury costs be- tween $2,234 and $3,832 for treatment, test- ing, and prophylactic drugs. Cal-OSHA has also estimated that the California safe needles and sharps law, passed last year and effective this August, will save affected businesses and facilities over $100 million per year in excess of the cost of the new devices. Similar bills are now pending in state legislatures across the country. While states are stepping to the plate to ad- dress this pressing concern, this is a national crisis and it deserves a national solution. The Health Care Worker Needlestick Prevention Act would amend OSHA's bloodborne patho- gens standard to require the use of safe nee- dle technology as the means for preventing needlestick injuries. It is a real-life solution that recognizes that these technologies are still not available or appropriate for use in every situa- tion. To that end, it includes an exception process if the device would interfere with pa- tient or worker safety, interfere with the suc- cess of a medical procedure, or if no such de- vice is available in the marketplace. It would also require stricter reporting of needlestick in- juries and creates a new clearinghouse on safer needle technology within NIOSH (Na- tional Institute for Occuaptional Safety and Health) to collect the data and to assist em- ployers with training curriculum and other ad- vice on available technologies. We stand here today with broad-based sup- port similar to that which made the California law possible. Our legislation is endorsed by numerous organizations including: the Service Employees International Union; the American Nurses Association; the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; Kaiser Permanente; The Consumer Federation of America; Becton Dickinson, a major medical device manufacturer; and the Emergency Nurses Association, the American Public Health Association, and AIDS Action. It is time to take the appropriate step of pro- tecting our health care workers. They simply should not be forced to risk their lives while trying to save ours. Mr. Speaker, I want to especially thank Con- gresswoman R OUKEMAfor her leadership on this issue and urge my colleagues on bothsides of the aisle to join us in support of this crucial effort. Attached is a more detailed summary of the bill. HEALTH CAREWORKER NEEDLESTICK PREVEN - TION ACT OF 1999, I NTRODUCED BY REPS. PETESTARK AND MARGE ROUKEMA BILL SUMMARY Purpose: This bill would correct a dan- gerous problem in today's health care sys- tem in which health care workers suffer pre- ventable needlestick injuries because appro- priate technologies to prevent such injuries are not being utilized. The bill would require the use of engi- neered safety mechanisms for needles and sharps in the health care arena to protect health care workers from life-threatening in- juries caused by needlesticks and other sharps injuries. OSHA Amendment: The bill amends OSHA's bloodborne pathogens standard to require that employers utilize needleless sys- tems and sharps with engineered sharps pro- tections to prevent the spread of bloodborne pathogens in their workplace. In carrying out this requirement, employ- ers are to work with direct care health care workers who use such devices to ensure the appropriate selection of technology. Exceptions: Safe needle technology will not be immediately, universally available and appropriate for all uses in the health care arena. Recognizing this fact, the bill provides for an exceptions process if an em- ployer can demonstrate circumstances in which the technology: Does not promote em- ployee safety; interferes with patient safety; interferes with the success of a medical pro- cedure; and is not commercially available in the marketplace. Exposure Control Plan: Employers would develop written exposure control plans to identify and select existing needleless sys- tems and sharps with engineered sharps pro- tections and other methods of preventing the spread of bloodborne pathogens. Sharps Injury Log: While we know that more than 800,000 health care workers suffer needlesticks every year, there is currently no uniform collection of data on sharps inju- ries to enable these incidents to be tracked, learned from, and prevented. The bill would create a sharps injury log that employers would keep containing de- tailed information about any sharps injuries that occur. Training: Employers would be required to adequately train direct care health care workers on the use of needleless technologies and systems with engineered sharps protec- tions. National Clearinghouse on Safer Needle Technology: The bill would establish a new clearinghouse within the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to collect data on engineered safety tech- nology designed to help prevent the risk of needlesticks and other sharps injuries. NIOSH would have access to the sharps in- jury logs in order to carry out these duties. The clearinghouse would also create model training curriculum for employers and health care workers. In order to carry out these new tasks, the institute is authorized $15 million in new funding. Application to Medicare Hospitals: HHS would promulgate new regulations regarding conditions of participation in Medicare for those hospitals that are not covered by OSHA so that all hospitals across the coun- try would, in effect, be covered by these new bloodborne pathogens requirements.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0Extensions of Remarks E1050 May 20, 1999 SIKH JOURNALIST GRILLED BY IN- DIAN INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS\u00d0 THERE IS NO FREEDOM OF THE PRESS IN INDIA HON. EDOLPHUS TOWNS OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, India claims that it is democratic, but one of the cornerstones of democracy is freedom of the press. A recent event shows us again that there is no freedom of the press in India. On May 11, Sukhbir Singh Osan, a jour- nalist who has written for many papers in India and runs the website Burning Punjab, was in- terrogated by Indian intelligence officers for 45 minutes after he returned from a trip to the United States, Canada, and Great Britain. He came to cover the big Sikh marches in Wash- ington, New York, and Toronto and to deliver a speech on the persecution of Christians that has been going on since Christmas Day. Apparently, this coverage upset the Indian oligarchy. The intelligence officers who came to Mr. Osan's house said that they had ``spe- cific instructions from Delhi.'' Mr. Osan has been targeted by the Indian government before. He was denied a degree he earned. His telephone has been bugged and he has received threats. He is not the only one. Reporters who exposed government abuses have received telephone threats. One reporter was told that ``it is dangerous to re- port against the government.'' That was under a Congress Party government. The govern- ment controls the television and radio as well as Press Trust of India (PTI) and United News of India (UNI). How can you have a democ- racy if the government controls the media and tries to intimidate reporters who report news that they don't want to come out? I thank my friend Dr. Gurmit Singh Aulakh, President of the Council of Khalistan, for bringing this story to my attention. His office issued an excellent press release on the grill- ing of Mr. Osan, which I believe will be very informative to my colleagues. How can the United States continue to sup- port a country that claims to be democratic but does not allow freedom of the press, kills tens of thousands over their religious beliefs, joins with the world's most notorious tyrants at the United Nations against the U.S., celebrates the anniversary of its nuclear explosion, rou- tinely violates basic human rights, and will not even allow a simple vote on the political future of the minority nations seeking their freedom? Why should such a country be a major recipi- ent of American aid and trade? We should stop our aid to India until it respects basic human rights and we should publicly declare our support for the 17 freedom movements within India's borders. I place the Council of Khalistan's press re- lease on the grilling of Mr. Osan into the RECORD. JOURNALIST GRILLED BY INDIAN INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS THERE IS NO FREEDOM OF THE PRESS IN INDIA WASHINGTON , D.C., May 12\u00d0Sikh journalist Sukhbir Singh Osan, who runs the website Burning Punjab, was interrogated by Indian intelligence officers after returning from a trip to the United States, Canada, and Great Britain, where he covered the Sikh 300th an-niversary marches in Washington, New York, and Toronto and made a speech on ``Recent Attacks on the Christian Community in India.'' Intelligence officers grilled Mr. Osan at his home yesterday for over 45 minutes. They claimed that ``we have specific instructions from Delhi.'' Mr. Osan stated that this ac- tion is ``true to their anti-Sikh stance.'' Mr. Osan has previously had his telephone bugged by the Indian government. He was de- nied a degree he earned because he has ex- posed corruption, atrocities, and acts of ter- rorism by the Indian government. He has re- ceived anonymous telephone threats. ``The interrogation of Sukhbir Singh Osan shows that there is no freedom of the press in India,'' said Dr. Gurmit Singh Aulakh, President of the Council of Khalistan. ``Both Press Trust of India (PTI) and United News of India (UNI) are completely controlled by the Indian government,'' Dr. Aulakh stated. Noting that Mr. Osan has met lawmakers in both the U.S. and Canada, Dr. Aulakh said that ``any more harassment of Mr. Osan will cause India big trouble.'' ``Reporters who put out information con- trary to the government line are often threatened and harassed as Mr. Osan was yesterday,'' he said. ``Reporters who have ex- posed government corruption and brutality have received anonymous telephone calls telling them that `it is dangerous to report against the government,''' Dr. Aulakh said. Mr. Aulakh urged the United States gov- ernment to stop supporting the government of India. ``India has joined with China, Rus- sia, Cuba, and Libya in action against the U.S. at the United Nations,'' he noted. ``India tried to build a security alliance against the United States. It recently celebrated the an- niversary of its nuclear explosion and reiter- ated its refusal to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. India is a major human- rights violator. Amnesty International has not been allowed into the country since 1978,'' he pointed out. ``Yet it remains one of the top recipients of U.S. aid.'' The Indian government has murdered more than 250,000 Sikhs since 1984, over 200,000 Christians in Nagaland since 1988, more than 60,000 Muslims in Kashmir since 1988, and tens of thousands of Assamese, Manipuris, Tamils, Dalit ``untouchables,'' and others. Tens of thousands of Sikhs languish in In- dian jails without charge or trial, some since 1984. ``Why should the American taxpayers be forced to support a country where there is no religious freedom, no freedom of the press, and no human rights for minorities?'' he asked. ``Why should America support a coun- try that is so vehemently anti-American?'' he said. ``The time has come for America to defend freedom in South Asia by defending Mr. Osan and other journalists, by cutting off aid to India, and by supporting the 17 freedom movements within India's artificial borders,'' Dr. Aulakh said. /fdash TRIBUTE TO WILLENE C. NESBITT HON. ROBIN HAYES OF NORTH CAROLINA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Willene C. Nesbitt of Concord, North Carolina for her commitment and dedi- cation to her community. On Saturday, May 22, 1999, Mrs. Nesbitt will be celebrating her retirement from North- east Medical Center in Concord. Mrs. Nesbitthas worked for more than 50 years at North- east Medical Center, formerly Cabarrus Me- morial Hospital, and has helped it grow and change into the fine regional hospital it is today. The celebration on Saturday is not only a retirement celebration, but also a show of ap- preciation for all of her efforts in the commu- nity. Mrs. Nesbitt has been active in the Shankletown-Sidetown Community Organiza- tion. She was one of the founding board mem- bers of this organization. One project that she recently spearheaded was gathering members of the community and surrounding areas together to help rebuild an elderly woman's dilapidated home to make it liveable again. Her selfless acts of kindness have brought so many in our community a better life. Mrs. Nesbitt and her husband, John C. Nesbitt, have also been active in their church, Gilmore Chapel AME Zion Church. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Willene Nesbitt in her retirement from the hospital, but hope that her community activity will only escalate with her new found free time. She truly brings a smile to the faces of the people she touches and improves the quality of life for everyone in Cabarrus County. /fdash HONORING MRS. ELLA SCHWARTZ HON. STEVEN T. KUYKENDALL OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. KUYKENDALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with sadness to remember and honor a legendary figure from my district, Mrs. Ella Schwartz. She passed away last week at the age of 80. Ella Schwartz was an icon of the city of Torrance and she has left a lasting im- pression on the city she called home. Ella Schwartz was the daughter of Sam Levy, a founding father of the city of Torrance. The Sam Levy Department Store was the pre- mier place to shop in the 1940's and 1950's. Following the death of her father in 1965, Mrs. Schwartz assumed control of the department store and in 1988 she transformed it into a women's boutique, naming it Ella's. Ella Schwartz was actively involved in the community. She will be forever be linked to the revitalization of downtown Torrance. She was devoted to the city of Torrance, becoming a symbol of the city's heart and center. Ella was a permanent fixture at her boutique until law year when she decided that it was time to retire and spend more time with her grandson. She was 79. People will remember her fiery spirit and her dedication to improving the city of Torrance. She will be missed but not forgotten. /fdash HONORING SHARI G. LAMBERT HON. DALE E. KILDEE OF MICHIGAN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a woman who has dedicated herself to improving the quality of life in myCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0Extensions of Remarks E1051 hometown of Flint, Michigan. On May 21, 1998, Mrs. Shari Lambert will be the guest of honor as family and friends gather to celebrate her retirement after 25 years of dedicated pub- lic service. Shari Lambert has never once hesitated to reach out and help someone in need. Since 1974, she has worked for the Michigan Em- ployment Security Commission, now known as the Michigan Unemployment Agency. Most re- cently, Shari worked as Manager for the Agen- cy's Flint branch. For 25 years, Shari has worked with thou- sands of individuals, ensuring that each one was set on the road toward prosperous and gainful employment. Her dedication to being an active public servant set a positive tone in each branch of the Michigan Employment Se- curity Commission, as well as its successor, the Michigan Unemployment Agency. She has served as a role model for efficiency, compas- sion, and fairness. Many Michigan residents owe their ability to provide for themselves and others to Shari's influence. In addition to her work with the Unemploy- ment Agency, Shari serves as a member of several Workforce Development Boards, such as the Career Alliance Board, Greater Pontiac Area Consortium Board, and Macomb/St. Clair Board. She can also be found working with groups within Macomb County such as Growth Alliance, the Private Industry Council, the School to Work/Tech Prep Board, the Human Services Coordination Body, the Macomb County Economic Club, and the Central Macomb Chamber of Commerce. She has also been a member of the Flint Chamber of Commerce, and is a past president of the Michigan chapter of the International Associa- tion of Personnel in Employment Security. Mr. Speaker, many people, not only in the city of Flint, have been granted a new lease on life because of the dedication of Shari Lambert. As it is our duty to preserve and pro- tect the quality and dignity of life for our con- stituents, let us remember that our task is made easier by people like Shari. I ask my colleagues in the 106th Congress to join me in acknowledging the accomplishments of Shari Lambert. We owe her a debt of gratitude. /fdash A TRIBUTE TO REVITALIZATION OF THE SOUTHERN AREA OF THE SLOPE (ROSAS) ON THE OC- CASION OF ITS COMMUNITY SERVICE AWARDS BANQUET HON. ANTHONY D.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to invite my colleagues to pay tribute to Revital- ization of the Southern Area of the Slope (ROSAS) on the occasion of its Community Service Awards Banquet. The members of ROSAS have long been known for their commitment to community service and to enhancing the quality of life for all New York City residents. This banquet is not only a festive hap- pening, it is a chance for all of us to celebrate and pay tribute to a group of individuals who have dedicated their lives to helping others. This year's honorees truly represent the best of what our community has to offer. Simon Brooking is the President of the 6th Avenue & 15th Street Community Garden anda former ROSAS board member. He is a staunch advocate for community green spaces, composting and ROSAS' anti graffiti campaign. His painting company, The Flying Scotsman, helped art teacher Alison Conte and local children create a mural on 14th Street and 5th Avenue in Brooklyn. Simon and his wife Sheila have built a partnership with the Sierra Club to promote organic waste composting. Perhaps the Garden's greatest gift is providing area children with the oppor- tunity to express themselves through their gar- dening and artistic talents. The Children's Cre- ative Workshop, now entering its fourth year, is one such program that is available to Park Slope's children. Carolyn Greer has spent the last four and a half years with New York State Senator Marty Markowitz and has lived up to the Senator's mandate that his staff be responsive to the needs of his constituents. As the Senator's Di- rector of Community Programming, she han- dled complaints, responded to issues and identified and addressed community needs. Carolyn Greer is a founding member of South Brooklyn Hockey, which has ice and roller teams, and serves on the board of the Rus- sian American Kids Circus. She is the author of the PS 321 Newsletter and is the founder of the PS 321 Holiday Helper Project, an an- nual drive for new clothes that are donated anonymously to several hundred needy public school children. As ROSAS' Co-President in 1993 and 1994, Roger C. Melzer documented the extensive damage being done to Prospect Park by unre- stricted barbequing, organized community meetings to discuss the problem and worked to have regulations and enforcement imposed. He remains a strong advocate for more en- forcement, better maintenance and more cap- ital funding to preserve the natural aspects of Prospect Park. As a twenty-year resident of Park Slope, Roger has been a regular partici- pant at Community Boards 6 and 7 meetings where his focus has been to ensure that city agencies provide service to residents in Park Slope and Windsor Terrace and to facilitate new initiatives as a means of resolving neigh- borhood problems. All of today's honorees have long been known as innovators and beacons of good will to all those with whom they come in contact. Through their dedicated efforts, they have each helped to improve my constituents' qual- ity of life. In recognition of their many accom- plishments on behalf of my constituents, I offer my congratulations on their being honored by ROSAS. /fdash INTRODUCTION OF MEDICARE MODERNIZATION #4 MEDICARE PERMANENT COMPETITIVE BID- DING AUTHORITY HON. FORTNEY PETE STARK OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my- self and Representative M CDERMOTT, I am pleased today to introduce the fourth bill in my Medicare modernization package: permanent competitive bidding authority. As with the other bills in this series, competitive bidding will save money for Medicare, while also improv- ing the quality of health services provided toMedicare beneficiaries. These modernizations are a template for meaningful Medicare reform that allows us to avoid radical, untried theories that could endanger the program's future. The promise of managed care is coordi- nated, comprehensive, cost-effective health services. Medicare+Choice plans are not cur- rently living up to this promise. For some time now, Medicare has over-paid Medicare+Choice plans. Current overpay- ments are estimated to cost Medicare and tax- payers $2 to $3 billion per year. This is be- cause Medicare+Choice has attracted only the healthiest beneficiaries\u00d0people who would have cost next to nothing had they stayed in the traditional fee-for-service plan\u00d0leaving a much sicker population in the traditional pro- gram. In addition, managed care plans are disenrolling beneficiaries who need expensive services, such as heart surgery, and then re- enrolling the beneficiary after the fee-for-serv- ice plan has paid the bill. The OIG estimates that in 1991 through 1996, Medicare spent $224 million for inpatient services furnished to beneficiaries within three months of their disenrollment. Had these beneficiaries not disenrolled, Medicare could have spent only $20 million in capitation payments. That's $204 million in savings Medicare could have realized. ``Cherry picking'' such as this has forced fee-for-service costs to rise. Because Medicare+Choice payments are tied to fee-for-service cost, rather than the ac- tual cost of providing care to beneficiaries en- rolled in managed care, Medicare continues to over-pay health plans. De-linking Medicare+Choice payments from the fee-for- service program will enable Medicare to pay a more realistic price for managed care serv- ices. Fostering greater competition through competitive bidding will help to achieve this goal. Competitive bidding would take place in both the managed care and fee-for-service Medicare programs. Under this bill, the Sec- retary of DHHS would have the explicit author- ity to select items, services, and geographic areas to be included in a bidding or negotia- tion process based on the availability of pro- viders and the potential to achieve savings. To protect quality, the bill would require that pro- viders meet specified quality standards in order to participate in the bidding process. Competitive bidding is almost universal throughout the private sector and in many other areas of government contracting. How- ever, HCFA is still forced to go through tor- tured demonstration processes to ``test'' this basic tool of capitalism. At this moment, HCFA is trying to get three competitive bidding demonstration projects off the ground: two Medicare+Choice demonstra- tions, one in Phoenix and one in Saint Louis; and one fee-for-service demonstration for du- rable medical equipment (DME). Unfortu- nately, the industry is blocking HCFA's attempt because they know that competitive bidding will force them to charge a more realistic price. This is not about cutting services to beneficiaries or lowering quality standards. It's about helping the taxpayer so that society has the money to improve Medicare for everyone while extending the life of the program. Com- petitive bidding can work. It has worked in the public and private sectors for centuries. We should make it work for Medicare too.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0Extensions of Remarks E1052 May 20, 1999 As we search for ways to secure and im- prove Medicare, it is appropriate to consider increasing the efficiency of the program through competition. Introducing competition into the managed care equation will achieve greater efficiencies, higher quality, and cost savings, and will enable Medicare managed care to live up to its promise. Following is a portion of an interview from the May/June 1999 issue of Health Affairs by Princeton professor Uwe Reinhardt with HHS Secretary Donna Shalala which describes how different it has been to make progress on this simple, basic, free enterprise approach to health care: THECONTROVERSY OVERCOMPETITIVE BIDDING Reinhardt: In my time, Medicare has been a pioneer in innovating with the DRG (diag- nosis-related group)\u00d0based hospital pay- ment system, which has been copied world- wide, and the Medicare physician fee sched- ule, which has been copied by private Amer- ican payers. If we are ever going to really test managed competition by having health plans compete fairly for enrollees, only HCFA (the Health Care Financing Adminis- tration) can actually show the way, because the private sector has not yet done it so far. Do you share that view? Shalala: I share that view, but the political system has to buy into it. For instance, we've announced a competitive-bidding dem- onstration in which we have some consensus among the experts as to where we ought to go and how to organize our experiment with managed competition. Phoenix and Kansas City are our two sites. Reinhardt: HCFA has attempted such dem- onstrations in Baltimore and Denver but was forced to abandon both efforts by private in- terests that were opposed to them. Shalala: Yes, in Denver we had bipartisan support to try it. But when we got specific and picked the places, we immediately had political opposition. However, Congress di- rected us (in the Balanced Budget Act [BBA] of 1997) to try again. We set up an advisory panel on which all of the political interests were represented. And now we're proceeding again. Reinhardt: I suppose that we should never expect the managed care industry to volun- tarily acquiesce to a competitive-bidding process because people instinctively don't like to compete. They prefer administered prices because such prices can be manipu- lated politically. Who is it, in general, that opposes competitive bidding? Shalala: One source of opposition is the managed care industry. The companies in that industry believe that such a process will undermine their profits. So the private sec- tor\u00d0the famed competitive marketplace\u00d0 doesn't want competition. They keep saying things like, ``Health care is different; we can't predict our costs.'' We have to have a system that is more nimble, more flexible. Managed care plans would not oppose a com- petitive-bidding process if they could modify the package of benefits. But if HCFA locks them into a benefits package, they want to be able to negotiate the price, rather than making competitive bids.INDIAN INTELLIGENCE INTERRO- GATES REPORTER AFTER VISIT TO AMERICA HON. JOHN T. DOOLITTLE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. DOOLITTLE. Mr. Speaker, India has once again shown true nature of its democ- racy by grilling a reporter who visited the United States. Journalist Sukhbir Singh Osan has exposed the corruption and the atrocities of the Indian government in newspapers and through his website, Burning Punjab. He vis- ited the United States, Canada, and Great Britain to cover the Sikh 300th anniversary marches and speak on human rights. He met with my colleague from Indiana, Mr. Burton, and with a minister in the Canadian govern- ment. Their pictures appear on his website. Mr. Osan returned to his home in Chandigarh before Indian intelligence officers showed up at his house to interrogate him for 45 minutes, claiming they were acting on in- structions from the central government in New Delhi. This is not the first time the Indian gov- ernment has gone after Mr. Osan. He has re- ceived anonymous threats and has been de- nied a law degree that he worked hard to earn because he had written news stories that the Indian government didn't like. Dr. Gurmit Singh Aulakh, President of the Council of Khalistan, brought this to my atten- tion. I understand that Dr. Aulakh has notified the Committee to Protect Journalists in New York of Mr. Osan's mistreatment. What happened to Mr. Osan is not just an isolated incident. Other reporters have been threatened for reporting stories critical of the Indian government. Clearly, there is no press freedom in India despite its loud and frequent boasts that it is ``the world's largest democ- racy.'' Does a democratic country harass reporters for covering stories that the government doesn't like? Would a democratic country in- cite 17 freedom movements within its borders? India is a democracy only for the Brahmin rul- ing class. It is also anti-American, working with such models of democracy as China, Libya, and Cuba to undermine U.S. foreign policy. It approached China and Russia trying to build a triangular ``security alliance'' against America. We should treat India as we do other viola- tors of religious freedom. That will help to end the kind of abuse that Mr. Osan and his fellow Sikhs suffer and bring real freedom to all the nations and peoples living within India's Bor- ders. I am placing the Burning Punjab story on Mr. Osan's harassment into the R ECORDfor the information of my colleagues. INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES GRILL SUKHBIR SINGH OSAN Chandigarh.\u00d0True to their anti-Sikh stance, the Indian Intelligence Agencies have again started harassment of innocents. Punjab based journalist, Sukhbir Singh Osan, who recently visited Unites States, Canada and United Kingdom for the purpose of participating in a human right convention to read a paper on the subject ``Recent at- tacks on Christian community in India'' and covering the 300 year celebrations of the Khalsa community was grilled by the intel- ligence sleuths for more than forty-five min- utes at his residence on May 11. When Mr.Osan asked the DSP [Intelligence Bureau] as to why he was questioning him about his vis- its abroad, the said DSP replied, ``Delhi wants to know all about it.'' When again asked whether there were any written in- structions, he replied that ``we have specific instructions from Delhi''. However, nothing in writing was given to Mr. Osan. /fdash A TRIBUTE TO LACKLAND ELE- MENTARY SCHOOL; RECIPIENT OF THE UNITED STATES DE- PARTMENT OF EDUCATION BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL AWARD HON. CHARLES A. GONZALEZ OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. GONZALEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my sincerest congratulations to Lackland Elementary School in San Antonio, TX, upon the notification of their receipt of the Blue Ribbon School Award. Schools are awarded the Blue Ribbon School Award based on their performance in regards to several criteria, including: student focus and support; active teaching and learn- ing; school organization and culture; chal- lenging standards and curriculum; professional community; leadership and educational vitality; school, family, and community partnerships; and indicators of success. Lackland Elementary joins three other schools in San Antonio and forty other Texas schools, all of which excelled in these areas and were rewarded with the Blue Ribbon School Award from the United States Depart- ment of Education. To receive consideration for this prestigious award, schools must be recommended for na- tional recognition by their individual state de- partment of education or sponsoring agency. Nominations are then evaluated by a National Review Panel including the Department of Education, the Department of Defense, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Council for Amer- ican Private Education and a select group of educators from around the country. The Sec- retary of Education then makes a final deter- mination based on the recommendations of this panel. In receiving this special recognition, I be- lieve that Lackland Elementary School will in- spire others to provide the level of quality edu- cation that this Blue Ribbon School Award merits. I am proud to represent a district and hail from a state that has clearly placed an emphasis on the education of our children. /fdash TRIBUTE TO COLLIS P. CHANDLER HON. BOB SCHAFFER OF COLORADO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. SCHAFFER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Collis P. Chandler, Jr., a friend of mine and a true friend of the petro- leum industry, who passed away May 5, 1999, at the age of 72. Mr. Chandler was a man of good character who loved life, his family and the industry upon which he had such a great impact. In aCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0Extensions of Remarks E1053 letter to her baby daughter describing grand- father Chandler, daughter-in-law, Anne, wrote eloquently telling her that many words de- scribed him, ``loving, generous, thoughtful, car- ing, intelligent, gifted, unique, witty, genuine. He was a man who made a difference. He was a man that changed the world and that, in the end, is all that one can ask from life.'' I wholeheartedly support Anne's representa- tion of Mr. Chandler. He was born on October 5, 1926 to Louise and Collis Chandler in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. In 1948 he graduated from Purdue University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechan- ical Engineering. Mr. Chandler joined Sohio Petroleum Com- pany in 1948 working in Louisiana and Kan- sas. In 1954 he founded the first of The Chan- dler Companies\u00d0Chandler-Simpson, Inc.\u00d0in Denver, Colorado. He was Chairman of The Chandler Company and its subsidiaries: Chan- dler & Associates, LLC and The Chandler Drilling Corporation at the time of his death. His companies have drilled more than 1,200 test wells, resulting in oil or gas discoveries or significant field extensions that number more than 100. Mr. Chandler was a past chairman of the National Petroleum Council and Natural Gas Supply Association. In addition, he also served as president of the Rocky Mountain Oil & Gas Association. Over the past 30 years, he held an impres- sive record of leadership in the American Pe- troleum Institute. He served on the Board of Directors since 1965 and the Executive Com- mittee since 1968. Mr. Chandler was a mem- ber of the Management Committee and has served on the Public Policy committee, and its forerunner, since 1978. In 1994, he received the American Petroleum Institute's highest award, The Gold Medal for Distinguished Achievement. His numerous honors and awards are a tes- tament to his lifetime of service to the oil and gas industry. He received the Secretary of En- ergy's ``Distinguished Service'' Medal; the Texas ``Independent of the Year'' Award; Landmen's ``Distinguished Service'' Award. His business activities outside of the petro- leum industry have included membership on the Board of Directors of the Public Service Company of Colorado and the Colorado Na- tional Bank. Mr. Chandler gave generously of his time and talents to his alma mater, Purdue Univer- sity, serving as a past president of the Purdue Alumni Association and as a member of the Board of Directors. He also served on the Board of Governors of the Purdue Foundation. He was currently serving on the Board of Di- rectors of ``Up With People.'' He was a current member of Castle Pines Golf Club, Denver Country Club, Burning Tree Club, Bethesda, Maryland, and the Thunder- bird Country Club, Rancho Mirage, California. He is survived by his wife, Patti, a son, Collis Chandler III of Denver, a daughter Mary Louise Henry of Lansing, Michigan; four step- daughters, Mary DeSimone of Denver, Gerri Ann Bragdon of Arvada, Kathlyn MaureenWoodard of Dallas, Texas and Paula Ann Novak of Pensacola, Florida; ten grand- children and four great-grandchildren. He was preceded in death by two sons; Thomas Grant Chandler and Robert Chandler. Mr. Speaker, it is men like Collis Chandler who have made this country great. Mr. Chan- dler helped shape America by being a good solid American citizen who worked hard to im- plement the right values. He contributed to so- ciety because he saw needs and filled them. Thank you, Mr. Chandler. /fdash CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1141, 1999 EMERGENCY SUPPLE- MENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT SPEECH OF HON. BARON P. HILL OF INDIANA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, May 18, 1999 Mr. HILL of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, today the House voted on the Conference Report of H.R. 1141, the 1999 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill. I voted against this bill and would like to explain my vote. Some of the spending items in this bill were bona fide emergencies. One emergency is supporting our troops currently deployed over- seas in Kosovo. I have voted several times to support our troops and the NATO operation in Kosovo. When our generals say they need 6 billion dollars to support our troops in Kosovo, I believe that is legitimate emergency spend- ing. I spoke recently on the floor of this House about the emergency many American farmers are facing at this moment. Farmers need cred- it right now to plant their crops and pay their bills. I am a member of the Agriculture Com- mittee and represent thousands of southern Indiana farmers. I believe that getting our farmers adequate loans and credit should be one of our top priorities. I believe helping farmers stay afloat is also legitimate emer- gency spending. But this bill spends billions of dollars on items that are not emergencies. For example, today's bill spends almost twice what our gen- erals say they need to meet our troops' needs in Kosovo. I am a member of the House Armed Services Committee and understand that our military has many pressing needs. One of our military's most urgent needs is giv- ing our soldiers pay and retirement increases. I will support increases in defense spending during the regular budget process. I believe that fiscal responsibility requires us to consider measures such as these during the normal budget process, where we make the often dif- ficult decisions about how we spend our lim- ited resources. It is not fiscally responsible to reach into the surpluses in the Social Security Trust Fund to pay for government projects that we should be finding ways to pay for in the normal budget process. We only have a budget surplus this year if we count the surpluses generated by the Social Security Trust Fund. We should not be using the money in the Social Security Trust Fund to pay for needs that are not emer- gencies.One of my top priorities in Congress is mak- ing sure that the Social Security program will be solid and solvent for future generations. Our government does not have many more pressing needs than saving Social Security. I will not vote for spending our Social Security funds on items that are not emergencies. Mr. Speaker, I did not vote for the Supple- mental Appropriations bill because the original purpose of this so-called ``Emergency'' bill was lost somewhere in the process. It became a way to spend billions of dollars outside of the budget process we have set up to control our spending. The final version of this bill was not fiscally responsible and I could not vote for it. /fdash CELEBRATING THE DEDICATION OF THE LIMA FIREFIGHTERS MEMORIAL MUSEUM HON. MICHAEL G. OXLEY OF OHIO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. OXLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to add a few words of praise for the dedication of the Lima Fire Fighters Memorial Museum. The Lima Fire Department has provided out- standing basic fire fighting and safety services to the Lima community since its formation in 1865. The museum built in Lincoln Park in Lima OH, will preserve the history of the Lima Fire Department as well as all the techno- logical changes they have implemented over the past 133 years When the Lima Fire Department was first established in 1865, it was a volunteer organi- zation consisting of seven men with their only equipment being six fire hooks. These hooks were used to pull burning thatch from the roofs of buildings. Over the years, however, the Lima Fire Department developed into a paid, highly trained force of 88 fire fighters and support personnel working in a three platoon system. They are housed at the Central Fire Station and four outlying stations. Equipment now includes seven pumpers, one aerial plat- form, two medic units and a staff car. Approxi- mately 700 fire fighters have served the city of Lima as members of the Lima Fire Depart- ment. More importantly, this museum will memori- alize all fire fighters who have served the Lima Community and especially the four Lima fire fighters who have given their lives in the line of duty. They are John S. Wolf and John Fish- er, both of whom died as a result of the Allen County Courthouse fire on January 7, 1929; Frank Kinzer, who died because of a fire on October 7, 1933, at the Ohio Music Company and Page Organ Company; and lastly, Cloyd R. Webb, who died as a result of the Marshall Sporting Goods fire on January 21, 1954. I wish to offer my sincere gratitude to all who are serving or who served as Lima fire fighters. They perform a valuable and dan- gerous task for the Lima community during times of great need. I honor each and every fire fighter for their dedication, knowledge, and hard work and hope that the Lima Fire Fight- ers Memorial Museum will stand as a tribute to each of them for all time.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0Extensions of Remarks E1054 May 20, 1999 NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION AU- THORIZATION ACT OF 1999 SPEECH OF HON. MICHAEL N. CASTLE OF DELAWARE IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, May 19, 1999 The House in Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1654) to authorize appropriations for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002, and for other purposes: Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Chairman, today the House of Representatives considers an impor- tant bill to improve and strengthen U.S. lead- ership in space exploration. This bill, the ``Na- tional Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act'' includes approval of funds for U.S. participation in the International Space Station, funds for aerospace and earth science research and funds for space science pro- grams. These are all important programs and worthy goals. However, I rise to speak in sup- port of an important technology for our future efforts to explore space: funding for research and develop into TransHab technology. TransHab uses inflatable structure tech- nology to package a much larger living and working volume in the equivalent Shuttle cargo size. In theory, the TransHab concept has more volume and radiation shielding when compared with the current Habitation module. TransHab could also serve as a technology demonstration for the human exploration of Mars. The NASA reauthorization bill currently prohibits NASA from making additional ex- penditures on any inflatable structure intended to replace current models on the International Space Station. However, the bill does leave the possibility for research and development of crew-related inflatable structures in FY01 and FY02. I understand the financial concerns the Committee on Science has expressed regard- ing funding TransHab technology for the Inter- national Space Station. Ideally, I would like to see TransHab technology funded now for the station, but I agree that in a time when Con- gress is struggling to keep the federal budget balanced, all federal programs should receive scrutiny and careful consideration. However, I think that it is very important that the Com- mittee continue to keep the door open on TransHab funding in the future. Those familiar with TransHab technology believe that this technology validates potential technology for future solar system exploration. TransHab technology could possibly mean a manned-ex- ploration of Mars which could result in a wealth of scientific information previously un- available. I believe that scientific research is vital to the current and future prosperity of our nation. I think we owe it to ourselves, to our nation, and especially to our children to keep the dream of manned space exploration alive. TransHab technology is an investment in our future. To permanently close the door on such research and development jeopardizes this nation's preeminence in science and tech- nology. In my home state of Delaware, we are fortu- nate to have ILC Dover, a leader in the aero- space industry and a company that has prov-en themselves a model for providing aero- space technology in accordance with NASA's new focus: ``better, faster, cheaper.'' ILC Dover has been providing innovative and cost- effective technology since 1947. ILC Dover has helped to provide the technology that put a man on the moon and Pathfinder on Mars, and ILC Dover will continue to help provide technology that will help future space missions in exploring our world. I am very proud of the research and devel- opment conducted by ILC Dover, and I am proud of the contributions ILC Dover has made to the U.S. Space Program. There is a strong commerical interest from committed, in- novative companies in the aerospace industry such as ILC Dover in helping to develop TransHab technology. I am encouraged that the Committee has left the door open for TransHab research in development in FY01 and FY02, and I look forward to any future Congressional hearings on the issue. /fdash LEGISLATION TO HONOR FORMER CONGRESSMAN KIKA DE LA GARZA HON. JAMES A. TRAFICANT, JR. OFOHIO INTHE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. TRAFICANT. Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing legislation to designate the U.S. border station located in Pharr, Texas, as the ``Kika de la Garza United States Border Sta- tion.'' The bill is identical to legislation I intro- duced in the last Congress. That bill was ap- proved unanimously by the House. Unfortu- nately, no action was taken on the legislation by the other body. I am proud to reintroduce this bill honoring a great legislator, former Congressman Kika de la Garza. Kika de la Garza was born in Mercedes, Texas on September 22, 1927. He earned his law degree from St. Mary's University in San Antonio, Texas in 1952. He served in the Navy from 1945 to 1946, and in the Army from 1950 to 1952. He served in the Texas House of Representatives from 1953 to 1965. In 1964 he was elected to Congress, where he was sent back to Congress by the people of the 15th Congressional District of Texas for 16 terms. In 1981 Kika became the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. During his 14-year tenure as chairman, Kika compiled an impressive record of achievement and dedicated service to America's farming com- munity. Most notably, Kika went out of his way to foster a climate of cooperation, inclusiveness and bi-partisanship on the committee. Under his able leadership, the Agriculture Committee was able to form a consensus on a number of important and intricate agricultural issues. In the 103rd Congress Kika played a lead role in the enactment of legislation revamping and streamlining the U.S. Department of Agri- culture. Kika de la Garza guided through legis- lation that made many needed and important changes, without eviscerating those USDA programs that were effective and needed to help America's farmers and protect the public. The bill, now law, made remarkable changes at USDA. Because of Chairman de la Garza's leadership and sage counsel, the bill represented the right way to ``reinvent'' gov- ernment.Throughout his 32-year career in Congress Kika never lost sight of the folks back home. He fought tirelessly for his constituents. He also proved to be an able and effective advo- cate for American farmers. In no small meas- ure because of his leadership, American agri- culture remains the envy of the world. The former chairman is also an amateur lin- guist and a gourmet cook. On many occasions he conversed with foreign dignitaries in their native tongue. On a personal level, Kika is my good friend, and I am so proud to sponsor this legislation. I urge all my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation. /fdash HONORING NEW YORK CITY PUB- LIC SCHOOL 122 FOR EXCEL- LENCE IN EDUCATION HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY OFNEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to salute a group of remarkable students and educators. While we see many unfortu- nate examples of failing schools, it is refresh- ing to share good news about a public school that is succeeding. New York State public schools test all sixth-grade students for read- ing ability. Among all the schools in the State of New York, the sixth graders at P.S. 122 fin- ished first in this reading test. Moreover, every sixth-grade student at P.S. 122 ranked at the highest level in reading. P.S. 122's outstanding accomplishment on this test is considered a citywide triumph be- cause the students overcame competition from more affluent suburban schools. The school attributes this success to its emphasis on ex- posing children to art, music and theater. With a diverse student body, P.S. 122 is ac- complishing an early goal of public edu- cation\u00d0preparing immigrants and their chil- dren with the necessary tools to build a new life in America. At P.S. 122, Hispanic students comprise almost a third of the student body with Asians making up additional 20%, and Af- rican Americans 10%. This School also serves numerous children from Italian, Greek, Indian, Native American, and other backgrounds. Forty percent of the students who succeeded so well in this standardized test began school with ``limited proficiency in English.'' Approxi- mately 65% of the student at P.S. 122 meet the criterion for free school lunches. The educators at P.S. 122 are to be strong- ly commended for their success. I particularly want to recognize the principle of P.S. 122, Mary Kojes, whose leadership helped inspire the best from the students who took the test. This spirit no doubt inspired, and continues to inspire, her students to strive for excellence. Mary Kojes and the extraordinary teachers of P.S. 122 have provided that New York City School students can reach the highest levels of achievement when they are properly pre- pared. The Students of P.S. 122 have also benefited from the support of the School Dis- trict 30 Superintendent, Dr. Angelo Gimondo and his staff. The real heroes of this story are the stu- dents of P.S. 122. This success demonstrates that hard work has clear and definite rewards. I asks my colleagues to join me in com- mending all those associated with P.S. 122.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0Extensions of Remarks E1055 MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED ACCESS TO CARE ACT HON. DONNA MC CHRISTENSEN OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mrs. CHRISTENSEN. Mr. Speaker, yester- day I along with 38 of my colleagues on the Congressional Black Caucus introduced H.R. 1860, the Medically Underserved Access to Care Act which seeks to address the needs of minorities in the managed care system. As a physician, I have seen the problems that mi- norities\u00d0both patients and healthcare pro- viders\u00d0can face within the managed care system. This bill seeks to ameliorate some of these difficulties by proposing some concrete solutions to overcome these problems. A key provision of H.R. 1860 would require managed care organizations to contract with providers in medically underserved commu- nities who are ethnically representative of the population of those communities. This will help to ensure that these providers have the cul- tural sensitivity needed to interact with their patients in an understanding manner that will directly cater to their specific medical needs and concerns as minorities. To make this lofty goal a reality, H.R. 1860 establishes a program of outreach grants to underserved communities that will help pa- tients locate culturally sensitive providers with- in their managed care plan. The bill also cre- ates a similar outreach grant program for doc- tors that will be operated through a national private non-profit organization in conjunction with the Department of Health and Human Services. The specific goal of this program will be to assist minority physicians and other health care providers to convert their practices and internal administrative procedures to best access the managed care system for both pri- vate insurance plans and Medicaid insurance plans. Ultimately, this bill seeks to redress the many grievances that minority physicians and patients have expressed regarding the man- aged care system. Addressing the problems that minorities face within the managed care system will take us one step closer to realizing the goal of Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to ensure that all Americans have access to quality care delivered in an ap- propriate manner. I want to express my thanks to the National Medical Association and its President, Dr. Gary Denis, for their invaluable help in devel- oping the language of this bill and assisting in getting it ready for introduction. I also want to thank my colleagues on the CBC for their sup- port in joining me as cosponsors of this impor- tant bill. /fdash H.R. AND IN- VESTOR ACCESS TO INFORMA- TION ACT OF 1999 HON. TOM BLILEY OFVIRGINIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. BLILEY. Mr. Speaker, we hear the phrase quite often that ``we live in the Informa- tion Age.'' This is true because of advances intechnology in recent years. Digital tech- nology\u00d0and more specifically, the Internet\u00d0 has brought a world of libraries and maga- zines and newspapers and on-line stock trad- ing to consumers' living rooms. And while technology played a critical role in paving the way for the Information Age, it's clear that access to the information itself is just as important. Consumers use the Internet to price shop, to compare mortgage rates, to buy stocks, and for a variety of other commer- cial activities. The underlying ingredient to all of these activities is information. Without it, electronic commerce would still be a twinkle in Bill Gates' eye. It is therefore critical that Congress take great care when it enacts laws that relate to consumers' access to information. Along with my colleagues on the Committee on Com- merce, Messrs. Dingell, Tauzin, Markey, Oxley, and Towns, I am introducing legislation that ensures that consumers and investors will continue to have full access to information when they surf the Web. H.R. 1858, the Consumer and Investor Ac- cess to Information Act of 1999, provides new protection to publishers of electronic data- bases, while ensuring that public access to in- formation will not be limited by publishers' as- serting a proprietary right over facts and infor- mation, which historically have been part of the public domain. The bill's anti-theft protec- tions will also protect institutions like the stock exchanges from hackers and pirates seeking to undermine the integrity of the data they dis- seminate to the public. Mr. Speaker, we live in the Information Age. We must keep information\u00d0like stock quotes\u00d0readily available to consumers on the information superhighway. Millions of Ameri- cans depend on information they obtain over the Internet to help them make important in- vestment decisions. This bill will ensure that consumers and investors continue to have ac- cess to this information. Mr. Speaker, Americans should not have to pay tolls for public information obtained on the information superhighway. Facts and informa- tion should remain toll-free on the information superhighway. Facts and information like stock quotes have been, and under H.R. 1858, will continue to remain readily available to the public. Mr. Speaker, in addition to my statement, I am submitting for the R ECORDa background piece on, as well as a section-by-section anal- ysis of, H.R. 1858. I urge my colleagues to join me, along with the rest of the bipartisan leadership of the Committee on Commerce, in supporting this legislation. H.R. 1858, T HECONSUMER AND INVESTOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT OF 1999 THE IMPORTANCE OF INFORMATION TO ELECTRONIC COMMERCE Economists have long recognized that one of the great obstacles to the efficient oper- ation of markets is imperfect information. A consumer might pay too much for an item because he or she was unaware of the lower price being charged for the item at another store, and the transaction cost of visiting all the stores to determine which charged the least exceeded the savings of buying at the least expensive store. This problem has be- come more significant as markets have be- come more complex. The need for informa- tion on which to base economic decisions is greater now than ever before. One of the great virtues of electronic com- merce is that it has the potential to provideits participants with much more information at much lower cost than is available in more traditional forms of commerce. This addi- tional information will allow for the much more efficient operation of markets for cap- ital, labor, and goods. If a small businessman is seeking a loan, the Internet will allow him to learn the terms offered by banks all over the country. If a computer programmer is looking for a job, the Internet will allow him to learn about opportunities in distant cit- ies. And if a homeowner needs to buy a new refrigerator, the Internet will provide him with the prices in stores throughout the re- gion. This information will obviously benefit both the purchaser and the seller of goods and services. We have seen some of these benefits in the last five years, and they will only accelerate in the years to come. One of the most explosive areas of growth that consumers have benefitted from through the Internet is in the area of securi- ties investing. According to a recent study, the number of households with people trad- ing on the Internet has nearly tripled, to 6.3 million in the last 16 months. And the same study reported that 20 million households use the Internet for investment news, quotes and ideas. This access to information about the stock market has empowered investors and given them greater control over their fi- nances. Studies have reported that investors feel increasingly secure about their invest- ment decisions as they use the Internet to monitor their portfolios, follow news about their holdings and obtain other information about their investments. Indeed, the Internet will make it so much easier for people to access information that they will be confronted with a new problem\u00d0 too much information. Accordingly, people will need tools for locating and organizing the information into useful forms. Other- wise, the information will be overwhelming. Such tools already exist in the form of data- bases, search engines, and webcrawlers, and these tools are becoming more sophisticated to keep up the information that is flooding the Internet. The basic information policy of this coun- try\u00d0a policy that has existed since the writ- ing of the Constitution\u00d0has served many communities, including the Internet and electronic commerce, extremely well. Our long-standing policy says that facts cannot be ``owned.'' Instead, they are in the public domain. Accordingly, a database publisher can visit the site of every bank in a state, extract data concerning each bank's loan programs, and construct a larger database with loan information for all the banks. An- other database publisher can then extract some of that information, and combine it with other information\u00d0for example, loan programs from out-of-state banks, or cus- tomer service ratings of the banks)\u00d0to cre- ate a new, more useful database which pro- motes commerce. This information policy facilitates elec- tronic commerce at an even more funda- mental level. The culture of science involves combining new data with existing databases to create more powerful research tools. Al- lowing scientists to reuse facts, rather than requiring them to ``reinvent the wheel,'' en- sures that research moves forward. Research and development is the foundation of all commercial activity. THE NEED FOR LIMITED LEGISLATION Although the existing information policy generally functions well in the context of the Internet and electronic commerce, there is one potential problem. Digital technology, which makes the Internet and electronic commerce possible, also increases the likeli- hood of unfair competition in the databaseCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0Extensions of Remarks E1056 May 20, 1999 publishing marketplace. Current law pro- vides some protection against unfair com- petition. For example, the selection, coordi- nation, and arrangement of facts in a data- base are often protected by copyright. In ad- dition, databases may be protected by li- cense, technological measures (e.g., encryption and watermarks), the state com- mon law of misappropriation, trademark, and trade secret. But notwithstanding these many legal remedies, there are complaints that system- atic unauthorized commercial copying of databases, particularly comprehensive data- bases stored in digital form, may sometimes go unremedied because of gaps in current law. H.R. 1858, the Consumer and Investor Access to Information (CIAI) Act of 1999, is designed to plug a hole that exists in current law. Because databases are items of commerce in their own right, and are critical tools for facilitating electronic commerce\u00d0indeed, in all commerce\u00d0Congress must assure that database publishers have sufficient protec- tion against unfair competition. At the same time, the protection for databases must not go so far as to protect the individual facts contained in the database. These must be available for a variety of second generation uses. Otherwise, those engaged in second generation uses\u00d0from a value-added pub- lisher, to a research scientist, to the con- sumer who compiles his own database when comparing characteristics of different cars\u00d0 would have to either pay a license fee, or somehow ``re-discover'' the facts themselves. This would amount to ``a tax on informa- tion.'' Moreover, it would represent a radical departure from our information policy that has made us the most technologically ad- vanced nation in world history. Accordingly, Title I of H.R. 1858 prohibits a person from selling or distributing a dupli- cate of a database collected and organized by another person that competes in commerce with the original database. The legislation defines a duplicate of a database as a data- base which is substantially the same as the first database. Further, a discrete section of a database may also be treated as a data- base. Thus, H.R. 1858 prevents the distribu- tion of pirated databases which could threat- en investment in database creation. At the same time, it does not prevent reuse of infor- mation for purposes of creating a new data- base. The issue of protecting databases is espe- cially significant to the securities markets, an issue that is addressed in Title II of H.R. 1858. This is because of the proliferation and growing importance of on-line investing. Re- cent statistics have shown that on-line trad- ing now accounts for nearly 1 out of every 7 equity trades (about 14%) and is growing rap- idly, with an increase of over 34% in on-line activity in the last quarter over the previous quarter. Having access to real-time stock quotes is essential to on-line investors. Investors can- not make informed buy-and-sell decisions without knowing the price of the stock they are trying to buy or sell. The way on-line in- vestors get this information is generally through the website of their on-line broker. Investors typically do not pay for this serv- ice. The brokers who provide this informa- tion to their on-line investing customers, however, do pay a fee. They pay the stock exchanges for access to the ``feed'' of real- time stock quotes. (``Real-time'' stock quotes are to be distinguished from those provided on a delayed basis, for which stock exchanges typically do not charge a fee.) While the Federal securities laws provide the regulatory structure under which the dissemination of securities transaction data to the public is governed, they do not pro-vide protection for the exchanges or other market information processors against pi- rates of that market data. In order to pro- tect the exchanges and other market infor- mation processors against hackers or others who would undermine the integrity of the data they disseminate or threaten their abil- ity to disseminate that data, Title II of H.R. 1858 provides a limited cause of action that enables market information processors to stop, and collect damages from, a person who disseminates data that he has obtained from a market information processor without that market information processor's authoriza- tion. Because market information processors provide market data to parties by means of contractual arrangements, and thus have the ability to seek redress under contract law in the event that a contracting party dissemi- nates the market data in a manner that is noncompliant with the contract, the cause of action that the bill provides is limited to ac- tions against parties with whom the market information processors do not have a con- tract or other agreement (such as hackers). Title II of H.R. 1858 also ensures that inde- pendently gathered real-time market data can be disseminated without triggering the bill's protections\u00d0thus ensuring that indi- viduals who develop a new database that they have not gleaned from a market infor- mation processor will be free to disseminate that database. Title II's limited scope provides necessary protection to market information proc- essors, without creating a new property right over market data that would enable market information processors to inappro- priately limit the dissemination of market data to public investors, such as on-line in- vestors. These investors need market data, such as real-time stock prices, in order to make their investment decisions. SECTION -BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF H.R. 1858 Section 1: Short Title. The short title of H.R. 1858 is the ``Consumer and Investor Ac- cess to Information Act of 1999.'' TITLE I \u00d0COMMERCE IN DUPLICATED DATABASES PROHIBITED Section 101: Definitions. Section 101(1) de- fines a ``database'' as a collection of discrete items of information (information is defined in Section 101(3)) that have been collected and organized in a single place, or in such a way as to be accessible through a single source. The collection and organization must have required investment of substantial monetary or other resources, and it must have been performed for the purpose of pro- viding access to those discrete items of in- formation by users of the database. The term database does not include textbooks, arti- cles, biographies, histories, scientific arti- cles, other works of narrative prose, speci- fications, and other works that include items of information combined and ordered in a logical progression or other meaningful way in order to tell a story, communicate a mes- sage, represent something or achieve a re- sult. Section 101(1) also makes clear that a dis- crete section of a database may also be treated as a database. For example, if a di- rectory of restaurants in the District of Co- lumbia is organized by type of food, the sec- tion comprising Italian restaurants could constitute a database within the meaning of the statute, even though it is part of a larger database (i.e., the D.C. restaurant directory). Section 101(2) defines ``a duplicate'' of a database as a database which is substan- tially the same as the original database, and was made by extracting information from the original database. A database need not be identical to another database in order to be considered ``substantially the same as'' the original database.Section 101(3) defines ``information'' as facts, data, or other intangible material ca- pable of being collected and organized in a systematic way. Works of authorship are ex- cluded from the definition of information. Such works\u00d0both individually and collec- tively\u00d0are adequately protected by copy- right. Section 101(4) defines ``commerce'' to mean all commerce which may be lawfully regulated by the Congress. The definition of ``in competition with'' in Section 101(5) has two components. First, the database must displace substantial sales of the database of which it is a duplicate. Sec- ond, the database must significantly threat- en the opportunity to recover a return on the investment in the collecting or organizing of the duplicated database. Thus, a duplicate of a database uploaded onto the Internet with- out authorization could be in competition with the underlying database (even if the Internet duplicate is available without charge) if it displaces substantial sales and threatens the opportunity to recover a re- turn on the investment in the first database. Section 101(6) defines two types of ``govern- ment databases.'' First, the term includes databases collected and maintained by the United States of America, or any agency or instrumentality thereof. Second, the term also includes a database that is required by Federal statute or regulation to be collected or maintained, to the extent so required. Section 102: Prohibition Against Distribu- tion of Duplicates. Section 102 sets forth the core prohibition against the sale or distribu- tion to the public of duplicated databases. Under Section 102, it is unlawful for any per- son, by any instrumentality or means of interstate or foreign commerce or commu- nications, to sell or distribute a database that is a duplicate of a database collected and organized by another person, and that is sold or distributed in commerce in competi- tion with that other database. Section 102 is intended to achieve a necessary balance be- tween (1) promoting fair competition in the database publishing market, and (2) ensuring consumers have unfettered access to facts and information. Section 103: Permitted Acts. Section 103 sets forth a variety of permitted acts. Sec- tion 103(a) clarifies that nothing in Title 1 of the DFCA restricts a person from selling or distributing to the public a database con- sisting of information obtained by means other than by extracting it from a database collected and organized by another person. Subsection 103(b) limits the application of this title to news reporting. It provides that nothing in the title shall restrict any person from selling or distributing to the public a duplicate of a database for the sole purpose of news reporting, including news gathering and dissemination, or comment, unless the information duplicated in time sensitive and has been collected by a news reporting enti- ty, and the sale or distribution is part of a consistent pattern engaged in for the pur- pose of direct competition. Subsection 103(c) specified that nothing in Title I shall prohibit an officer, agent, or em- ployee of the United States, a state, or a po- litical subdivision of a State, or a person act- ing under contract of such officers, agents, or employees, from selling or distributing to the public a duplicate database as part of lawfully authorized investigative, protec- tive, or intelligence activities. Subsection 103(d) provides that no person or entity who, for scientific, educational, or research purposes, sells or distributes to the public a duplicate of a database, shall incur liability under this title so long as the con- duct is not part of a consistent pattern en- gaged in for the purpose of direct commer- cial competition.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0Extensions of Remarks E1057 Section 104: Exclusions. Section 104 pro- for exclusions to Section 102's prohibi- tion. Subsection 104(a)(1) provides that pro- tection for databases under Section 102 does not extend to government databases, as such databases are defined in Section 101(6). Sub- section 104(a)(2) clarifies that the incorpora- tion of all or part of a government database into a non-government database does not preclude protection for the portions of the non-government database which came from a source other than the government database. Section 104(a)(3) provides that Title I does not prevent Federal, state, or local govern- ment from establishing by law or contract that a database funded by Federal, state, or local government shall not be subject to the protections of this title. Subsection 104(b) excludes databases re- lated to Internet communications. In par- ticular, under Subsection 104(b), protection does not extend to a database incorporating information collected or organized to per- form (1) the function of addressing, routing, forwarding, transmitting or storing Internet communications, or (2) the function of pro- viding or receiving connections for tele- communications. Most databases stored in digital form re- quire computer programs for their use. Para- graph 104(c)(1) therefore provides that pro- tection for databases under Section 102 shall not extend to computer programs (as defined in 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101), including computer pro- grams used in the manufacture, production, operation or maintenance of a database. Fur- ther, any element of a computer program necessary for its operation is not protected. At the same time, Paragraph 104(c)(2) ex- plains that a database that is otherwise sub- ject to protection under Section 102 does not lose that protection solely because it resides in a computer program. However, the incor- porated database receives protection only so long as it functions as a database within the meaning of Title I (i.e., a collection of dis- crete items of information collected for the purpose of providing access to those discrete items by users), and not as an element nec- essary to the operation of the computer pro- gram. Subsection 104(d) provides that protection for databases under Section 102 does not pro- hibit the sale or distribution to the public of any individual idea, fact, procedure, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery. Finally, under subsection 104(e), provides that protection for databases under Section 102 does not extend to subscriber list information. Section 105: Relationship to Other Laws. Section 105 explains the relationship of the DFCA to other laws. Subsection 105(a) makes clear that, subject to the preemption under Subsection 105(b), nothing in Title I affects a person's rights under the laws of copyright, patent, trademark, design rights, antitrust, trade secrets, privacy, access to public docu- ments, misuse, and contracts. Subsection 105(b) preempts state laws inconsistent with the DFCA's prohibition in Section 102. Section 105(c) provides that, subject to the provisions on misuse in Subsection 106(b), nothing in Title I shall restrict the rights of parties freely to enter into licenses or any other contracts with respect to the use of in- formation. Subsection 105(d) makes clear that Title I of the DFCA does not affect the operation of the Communications Act of 1934, or the authority of the Federal Communica- tions Commission. Section 106: Limitations on Liability. Sec- tion 106 sets forth limitations on liability for violations of Section 102. Subsection 106(a) provides that a provider of telecommuni- cations or information services (within the meaning of Section 3 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 153)), or the operator offacilities therefore, shall not be liable for a violation of Section 102 if such provider or operator did not initially place the database that is the subject of the violation on a sys- tem or network controlled by the provider or operator. Subsection 106(b) limits the liability of a person for a violation of Section 102 if the person benefiting from the protection af- forded by Section 102 misused that protec- tion. Subsection 106(b) sets forth six non- exclusive factors a court should consider in determining whether a person has misused the protection provided by Section 102. Section 107: Enforcement. Section 107 au- thorizes the Federal Trade Commission to take appropriate actions under the Federal Trade Commission Act to prevent violations of Section 102. Section 108: Report to Congress. Section 108 directs the Federal Trade Commission to report to Congress within 36 months of en- actment on the effect Title I has had on elec- tronic commerce and the domestic database industry. Section 109: Effective Date. Section 109 provides that Title I of H.R. 1858 shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act, and shall apply only to the sale or distribu- tion after that date of a database that was collected and organized after that date. TITLE II \u00d0SECURITIES MARKET INFORMATION Section 201: Misappropriation of Real-Time Market Information. Section 201 of H.R. 1858 amends Section 11A of the Securities Ex- change Act of 1934 by adding a new Sub- section 11A(e), entitled ``Misappropriation of prohibits the misappropriation of real-time market information from a market information processor, establishes liability on the part of any person who violates the prohibition, and provides a market informa- tion processor with a variety of remedies against the violator. This provision ex- pressly permits certain acts that are not in- cluded in the prohibition, namely inde- pendent gathering of market information and news reporting of market information. The subsection also limits the cause of ac- tion provided by the bill to apply only to parties with whom the market information processor does not have a contract regarding the real-time market information or other right the market information processor is seeking to protect. Paragraph 11A(e)(1) imposes liability on any person who obtains, directly or indi- rectly, real time market information from a market information processor, and directly or indirectly extracts, sells, distributes or redistributes, or otherwise disseminates such real-time market data without the author- ization of the market information processor. The prohibition in Paragraph 11A(e)(1) would not apply to a person who merely obtained, directly or indirectly, real-time market in- formation from a market information proc- essor, but did not disseminate the informa- tion in any way. Paragraph 11A(e)(2) sets forth the remedies that a market information processor is au- thorized to assert against any person who misappropriates real-time market informa- tion in violation of Paragraph (1). In par- ticular, under Subparagraph 11A(e)(2)(A), an injured person would be authorized to bring a civil action in an appropriate United States district court, except that any action against a State governmental entity may be brought in any court that has jurisdiction over claims against such entity. Subpara- graph 11A(e)(2)(B) authorizes any court hav- ing jurisdiction of a civil action under Sec- tion 11A(e) to grant temporary and perma- nent injunctions, according to principles of equity and upon such terms as the court maydeem reasonable, to prevent a violation of Paragraph 11A(e)(1). Under Subparagraph 11A(e)(2)(C), a plaintiff would be permitted to recover money damages sustained by the plaintiff when a violation of Paragraph (1) was established in a civil action. And under Subparagraph 11A(e)(2)(D), a court, in its eq- uitable discretion, would be authorized to order disgorgement of the amount of defend- ant's monetary gain directly attributable to a violation of Paragraph (1) if the plaintiff is not able to prove recoverable damages to the full extent of the defendant's monetary gain. Paragraph 11A(e)(3) would exclude two types of legitimate activity from the scope of the bill\u00d0the independent gathering of real-time market information and news re- porting. Under Subparagraph 11A(e)(3)(A), no person would be restricted from independ- ently gathering real-time market informa- tion, or from redistributing or disseminating such independently gathered information. A person would be considered to obtain real- time market information ``independently'' only to the extent that such information was not obtained, directly or indirectly, from a market information processor. In addition, under Subparagraph 11A(e)(3)(B), no news re- porting entity would be restricted from ex- tracting real-time market information for the sole purpose of news reporting, including news gathering, dissemination, and com- ment, unless the extraction was part of a consistent pattern of competing with a mar- ket information processor in the distribution of real-time market information. Thus, news organizations that limit their use of real- time market information to legitimate re- porting of the news would not be subject to liability. Paragraph 11A(e)(4) establishes the rela- tionship of Subsection 11A(e) with a variety of other Federal and State laws that also may address the dissemination of real-time market information. Subparagraph 11A(e)(4)(A) provides that Subsection 11A(e) would exclusively govern the unauthorized extraction, sale, distribution or redistribu- tion, or other dissemination of real-time market information and would supersede any other Federal or State law, whether statu- tory or common law, to the extent that such other Federal or State law is inconsistent with Subsection 11A(e). This subparagraph would not preempt State law that is not in- consistent with Subsection 11A(e) (e.g., State law governing trademark or trade dress). In addition, under Subparagraph 11A(e)(4)(B), Subsection 11A(e) would not limit or other- wise affect the application of any provision of the federal securities laws or the rules or regulations thereunder, and would not im- pair or limit the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Thus, the Com- mission's existing authority over distribu- tors of market information, including its au- thority over fees charged for market infor- mation, would continue unchanged. Subparagraph 11A(e)(4)(C) provides that the constraints that are imposed by Federal and State antitrust laws on the manner in which products and services may be provided to the public, including those regarding the single suppliers of products and services, would not be limited in any way by Sub- section 11A(e). In addition, under Subpara- graph 11A(e)(4)(D), the rights of parties to enter freely into licenses or any other con- tracts with respect to the extraction, sale, distribution or redistribution, or other dis- semination of real-time market information would not be restricted. Thus, the bill pre- serves all rights under state contract law. Paragraph 11A(e)(5) limits the actions that may be maintained pursuant to section 11A(e). Pursuant to Subparagraph 11A(e)(5)(A), a civil action under Subsection 11A(e) would have to be commenced withinCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0Extensions of Remarks E1058 May 20, 1999 one year after the cause of action arises or the claim accrues. And under Subparagraph 11A(e)(5)(B), a civil action for the dissemina- tion of market information would be pre- cluded if such information was not real-time market information. Thus, the bill does not limit in any way, or provide any cause of ac- tion regarding, the use and dissemination of delayed market data. Finally, Subparagraph 11A(e)(5)(C) precludes a civil action by a market information processor against any person to whom such processor provides real- time market information pursuant to a con- tract between the two parties, but only with respect to any real-time information or any right that is provided pursuant to the con- tract. Market information processors would continue to have available their contractual remedies regarding persons with whom they have a contract, but would not be afforded new remedies under Subsection 11A(e) against these persons with respect to rights covered by that contract. Paragraph 11A(e)(6) defines several terms used in section 11A(e) that are not defined elsewhere in the Exchange Act. The term ``market information'' is defined in Subpara- graph 11A(e)(6)(A) to mean information with respect to quotations and transactions in any security, the collecting, processing, dis- tribution, and publication of which is subject to the Exchange Act. Under Subparagraph 11A(e)(6)(B), the Securities and Exchange Commission may, consistent with the pro- tection of investors and the public interest, prescribe by rule the extent to which market information shall be considered to be real- time market information for purposes of Subsection 11A(e), but in promulgating any such rule, the Commission must take into account the present state of technology, dif- ferent types of market data, how market participants use market data, and other rel- evant factors. This requirement is designed to ensure that any rule that the Commission promulgates regarding real-time market data does not hinder access by investors to such data, and maximizes the access by in- vestors to all market data, including real- time and delayed market data. In the ab- sence of Commission action, the determina- tion of whether market information is real- time market information would be left to the courts with jurisdiction over civil ac- tions under Subsection 11A(e) to interpret the plain language of the term ``real-time.'' Finally, the term ``market information processor'' with respect to any market infor- mation is defined in Subparagraph 11A(e)(6)(C) to mean the securities exchange, self-regulatory organization, securities in- formation processor, or national market sys- tem plan administrator that is responsible under the Exchange Act or the rules or regu- lations thereunder for the collection, proc- essing, distribution, and publication of, or preparing for distribution or publication, of such market information. Section 202: Effective Date. This section provides that the new Subsection 11A(e) shall take effect on the date of the enact- ment of H.R. 1858, and shall apply to acts committed on or after that date. Further- more, no person shall be liable under Sub- section 11A(e) for the extraction, sale, dis- tribution or redistribution, or other dissemi- nation of real-time market information prior to the date of enactment of this bill, by that person or by that person's predecessor in in- terest.EXPOSING RACISM HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON OF MISSISSIPPI IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. Speaker, in my con- tinuing efforts to document and expose racism in American, I submit the following articles into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. WHITE MAN SENTENCED TO PRISON FOR PUNCHING WOULD -BE BLACK NEIGHBOR BIRMINGHAM , AL (AP).\u00d0A judge sentenced a white man to 2 years in federal prison and ordered him to pay more than $30,000 for punching a black man who wanted to be his next-door neighbor. Wendell Johnson, 33, was convicted in Feb- ruary of violating the Fair Housing Act by hitting Kenneth Ray Coleman, who suffered a broken nose in the assault. ``I want to apologize,'' Johnson, choking back tears, told Coleman during a hearing Wednesday. ``I know you went through a lot of hard times because of it.'' Coleman, 35 said he believed the apology was sincere and accepted it. Johnson hit Coleman in the face last June after Coleman came to his house and asked where he could find the local water company. Coleman testified he has since had breath- ing difficulties, and a doctor has rec- ommended surgery to fix the problem. But, Coleman said, he lacks the $3,500 for the op- eration. U.S. District Judge U.W. Clemon ordered Johnson to pay Coleman $30,911 for pain, suf- fering, lost wages and other expenses related to the assault. Johnson also was ordered to pay $1,300 to the Alabama Crime Victims' Compensation Commission. Clemon said he would consider a request to let Johnson remain free during a possible ap- peal. TAFTSCORES POINTS AT MEETING WITHBLACK DEMOCRATS WITHBC\u00b1OH (by Paul Souhrada) COLUMBUS , OH (AP).\u00d0The honeymoon con- tinues for Gov. Bob Taft. Taft, who smoothed relations with labor leaders last month, scored points with black lawmakers during a wide-ranging meeting over issues important to minorities. The members of the all-Democratic Ohio Legislative Black Caucus on Wednesday asked Taft, a Republican, for more money for Central State University, a more aggres- sive state affirmative action program and a commitment to appoint more minorities to state agencies. ``We had a very fruitful meeting with the governor,'' Sen. C.J. Prentiss, D-Cleveland, told reporters afterward. Taft impressed the group with his sin- cerity, Prentiss said. Taft also found the meeting useful and said he wants to meet with the group again, said spokesman Scott Milburn. Taft was particularly interested in looking for ways to increase literacy among school- children, said Prentiss, president of the black caucus. She said she told Taft that her 18-member group was concerned that the cor- nerstone of his literacy program\u00d0the high- profile OhioReads campaign to recruit 20,000 volunteer reading tutors\u00d0falls short of what is needed. Milburn said Taft assured the lawmakers that OhioReads was only the first step in the governor's effort to make sure all children learn to read. Prentiss also pressed Taft to ask law- makers for another $3.5 million for CentralState, the only state-funded, historically black college in Ohio. The money would be used to expand the urban education program at the school in Wilberforce, for recruiting and to pay back debt from the school's finan- cial troubles in the 1980s and early part of the 1990s. Taft already asked for an extra $2 million for Central State, Milburn said. He wants to meet with Central State President John Gar- land before making any other moves. Taft is interested in a suggestion from Rep. Otto Beatty, D-Columbus, to study how successful minority businesses are in getting state contracts, Milburn said. The issue of minority set-asides has been at the center of conflicting rulings recently from the Ohio Supreme Court and a federal district judge. But until the matter is de- cided, Taft wants to resume Ohio's programs without raising new legal issues, Milburn said. Taft also will consider another Beatty pro- posal: an order dealing with affirmative ac- tion statewide. Taft might be interested in expressing sup- port for reaching out to women and minority businesses and encouraging them to seek state contracts, but he opposes quotas, Milburn said. Among the other ideas suggested by the legislators:\u00d0Adding more money for edu- cation to stop the spread of AIDS, particu- larly among young blacks and women. Creating an independent watchdog agency to oversee state contracts. Making sure that minorities and inner city residents get their fair share of the money from the state's settlement with the tobacco industry. Including more minorities in state govern- ment jobs and on state boards and commis- sions. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS ASKSCOURT VERTUNO (BYAUSTIN , TX (AP).\u00d0The University of Texas has asked a federal appeals court to reconsider a decision that led to the elimi- nation of affirmative action policies at the state's public colleges and universities. School officials asked the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday to reconsider its so-called Hopwood ruling. ``This case addresses one of the most im- portant issues of our time . .. and it de- serves the fullest possible hearing and a most careful decision by the federal courts,'' said Larry Faulkner, president of the univer- sity. The Hopwood ruling came in a lawsuit against the University of Texas law school's former affirmative-action admissions policy. The ruling, which found that the policy discriminated against whites, was allowed to stand in 1996 by the U.S. Supreme Court. Former Attorney General Dan Morales then issued a legal opinion directing Texas colleges to adopt race-neutral policies for ad- missions, financial aid and scholarships. Legislators asked new Attorney General John Cornyn for a second opinion. His office helped university officials write the appeal submitted Tuesday. According to University of Texas System Regent Patrick Oxford, the Hopwood ruling left Texas at a competitive disadvantage with other public universities in recruiting students. The appeal argues that limited consider- ation of race in admissions is necessary to overcome the effects of past discrimination. It also says the school has a compelling in- terest in a racially and ethnically diverse student body. A state Comptroller's Office study released in January showed a drop in the number ofCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0Extensions of Remarks E1059 minorities applying for, being admitted to and enrolling in some of the state's most se- lective public schools. PROPOSAL WOULD MAKEOLEMISSPRIVATE OXFORD , M ISS. (AP).\u00d0A College Board member has proposed making the University of Mississippi a private institution as part of the settlement in the state's 24-year-old col- lege desegregation case. James Luvene of Holly Springs submitted the proposal, among others, to U.S. District Judge Neal Biggers Jr. ``Allowing Ole Miss to go private will help solve many funding problems as they exist today,'' Luvene said in the 10-page proposal. Luvene said his proposal is designed to ``bring closure to our state's long and painful epoch of discrimination against black citi- zens and historically black institutions of higher learning.'' Immediately the plan drew opposition from lawmakers and Ole Miss. ``We're a great public university,'' said Ole Miss Chancellor Robert Khayat. ``We like being a public university and can only serve the state better.'' The desegregation lawsuit, known as the Ayers case, accused the state of neglecting its three historically black universities. Biggers is overseeing the desegregation of Mississippi's colleges. Khayat said he is not familiar with any public American university ever going pri- vate. Luvene recommended paying the Oxford college $151 million before making it private in 2000. He recommended that the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson be- come independent and be called the State In- stitute of Health and Medicine. Khayat also opposes that and said 72 of the 73 U.S. medical centers are tied to a parent university. ``It's just ludicrous what he (Luvene) is saying,'' said Sen. Terry Jordan, D\u00b1Philadel- phia, an Ole Miss alumnus. ``They've all been state-supported and will continue to be.'' David Sansing, a retired Ole Miss histo- rian, said, ``the likelihood of this happening is nil, zero.'' ``This plan would open up an entirely new controversy that would rage for years. I'm just astounded by it,'' said Sansing. Luvene said State in Starksville ``puts two of our three comprehensive institutions in a sparse- ly populated part of the state, causing un- necessary duplication.'' Luvene also has proposed that historically black Jackson State be given a law school, pharmacy school and an air traffic control program. NEWJERSEY CONCEDES RACIAL PROFILING EXISTS (By Thomas Martello) TRENTON , N.J. (AP).\u00d0Complaints that state troopers target blacks and Hispanics along the heavily traveled New Jersey Turn- pike are ``real, not imagined,'' according to a report issued by the state's attorney general. The report, released Tuesday, concludes that even though the state police have no policy condoning the practice known as ra- cial profiling, it does exist\u00d0and was fostered in part by ambiguous rules. ``There is no question racial profiling ex- ists at some level,'' Gov. Christie Whitman said. ``These findings are distressing and dis- turbing. Minorities deserve the assurance they will be treated no differently than any other motorist.''The report, commissioned by state Attor- ney General Peter Verniero, stresses ``the great majority of state troopers are honest, dedicated professionals.'' But the force's command structure needs to institute policy changes to end a culture that encourages using race as a reason to stop motorists, the report says. While six out of 10 motorists stopped are white, minorities are far more likely to be subjected to searches and aggressive treat- ment by troopers, the report said. Statistics show that 77.2 percent of motorist searches were of blacks or Hispanics, and only 21.4 percent were of white motorists. ``Minority motorists have been treated dif- ferently than non-minority motorists during the course of traffic stops on the New Jersey Turnpike,'' the report says. ``We conclude the problem of disparate treatment is real\u00d0 not imagined.'' The report came one day after two troop- ers were indicted on charges they falsified reports to make it appear that some of the black motorists they pulled over were white. The U.S. Justice Department also has been investigating racial profiling allegations against New Jersey's state police. Similar accusations have been made in Florida, Maryland, Connecticut and elsewhere along the Interstate 95 corridor. The findings in the report confirm what many civil rights activists said they have known for years. ``We do not believe that any reasonable person in New Jersey is surprised at all today to hear this acknowledgment,'' said The Rev. Reginald Jackson, executive direc- tor of the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey. ``Now, however, comes the hard and difficult part, and that is the process ending racial profiling.'' JUDGE APPROVES END TO RACE-BASED ENROLLMENT IN SANFRANCISCO (by Bob Egelko) SANFRANCISCO ( AP).\u00d0A federal judge has ordered an end to 16 years of race-based en- rollment in San Francisco public schools, ap- proving a settlement of a lawsuit by Chinese- Americans who were denied admission to the city's preferred campuses. Despite protests by blacks and Hispanics, U.S. District Judge William Orrick said ra- cial admissions violate Chinese Americans' constitutional rights to equal treatment in choosing their schools. He approved the set- tlement on Tuesday. The suit was filed in 1994 on behalf of one student who was denied admission to a mag- net high school despite a high score on its entrance exam\u00d0higher than some non-Chi- nese students who were admitted\u00d0and by two who were turned away from neighbor- hood elementary schools. The settlement repeals a limit of 45 per- cent of any racial or ethnic group at a single school and 40 percent at desirable ``magnet'' schools. Those limits were part of a 1983 con- sent decree, approved by Orrick, that settled a discrimination lawsuit filed in 1978 by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The district has until October to prepare a new enrollment plan for the fall of 2000 to maintain diversity in schools without as- signing any student primarily because of race. ``Resegregation is inevitable,'' declared Robert Franklin, who said he lives in San Francisco so that his two children\u00d0a 7-year- old black girl and a 2-year-old white boy\u00d0 can attend its schools. ``I want to keep them in an integrated, racially diverse public school.''FORMAL CEREMONY WILLDECRY RACISM IN OREGON 'SHISTORY PORTLAND , OR (PA).\u00d0Bobbi Gary moved to Portland in 1942 and found a scene straight out of the old South. Restaurants wouldn't seat her. Real estate agents wouldn't sell to her. And theaters would only let her sit in the ``buzzard roost'' seats\u00d0all because she is black. Gary will recall those experiences when she travels to Salem on Thursday to hear Or- egon's leaders formally acknowledge the state's discriminatory past. The Day of Acknowledgment, timed to co- incide with the 150th anniversary of a law that barred ``negroes and mulattos'' from the Oregon Territory, also will honor Gary and others who have struggled for racial justice. Leaders of Oregon Uniting, the multiracial organization that proposed the Day of Ac- knowledgment, hope a ceremony formally recognizing the state's racist past will be a step toward racial healing. Some who plan to witness the ceremony say they are ambivalent about it\u00d0pleased at the recognition, but skeptical about what it will accomplish. ``To acknowledge these things forces us to relive them,'' said Carl Flipper Jr., a North Portland economist who has rented a bus for more than 30 Portland blacks who will at- tend the ceremony. ``It's painful.'' Witnesses will bring different memories to the observance in the House chamber on Thursday. Sue Shaffer, chairwoman of the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribes in Southern Oregon, will think about a massacre of American In- dians outside Roseburg in the mid-1850s. ``I am hoping, and I said hoping, that events like this, days like this, acts like this, will help to bring up a consciousness across America of the rightful place of In- dian people.'' she said. Peggy Nagae, a former civil rights attor- ney and now a diversity consultant based in Eugene, said she will think about her par- ents, grandparents and others in the Japa- nese American community who were forced into internment camps during World War II. And she will think about Minoru Yasui, a lawyer from Hood River who dared in 1942 to test federal curfew laws placed on Japanese Americans by walking the streets of Port- land after dark. Nagae, who helped him fight his arrest all the way to the U.S. Supreme court, remem- bers him as one of Oregon's heroes. ``The thing that always struck me about Yasui was that he was an ordinary person who did extraordinary things,'' she said. Gary, an impassioned community activist who has fought discrimination for decades, recalls the day in the '40s when she and her future husband, Fred, went to a popular Portland restaurant. At first, no one would wait on them, she said. When a waitress fi- nally did, the couple ordered steak, the most expensive item on the menu. But when the food came, the steak was buried under so much salt and pepper that it was inedible. Before walking out, she scolded the waitress over the restaurant's obvious attempt to discourage them from returning. Now a great-grandmother of two, Gary continues to fight battles on behalf of Afri- can Americans, children and the elderly. A saying that hangs on her dining room wall captures her resilience: ``Good things come to those who wait. But they come a lot soon- er to those who act.'' It is that spirit that will propel her to Salem on Thursday. ``This is not exactly a joyous occasion,'' she said. ``It is something I feel is late in coming. But I'm glad to see it.''CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0Extensions of Remarks E1060 May 20, 1999 STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE HON. F. JAMES SENSENBRENNER, JR.

OF OKLAHOMA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 20, 1999 Mr. ISTOOK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to cosponsor H.R. 1620, a bill to free the National Labor Relations Board from being overburdened because bracket creep that has forced them to accept cases from very small employers in this na- tion. Here is a copy of my ``Dear Colleague'' and a report from the Labor Policy Association that outlines the problem and why it is impor- tant to small businesses in America to correct this problem. U.S. C ONGRESS , Washington, DC. FREE THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD (NLRB) : HELP REDUCE UNNECESSARY BURDEN ON SMALL BUSINESS DEAR COLLEAGUE : This Congress, Mr. Istook is introducing legislation to help the NLRB manage their huge caseload. Each year the NLRB requests additional funding to help them administer and manage their caseload. This legislative reform simply makes adjustments for inflation in the finan- cial jurisdictional thresholds of the NLRB, most of which were set in 1959. The NLRB can still adjudicate special cases below these thresholds, just as they can do today. It is crucial that we provide the NLRB with this freedom. We urge you to cosponsor this bill. Two former NLRB Chairs support this change. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is the government agency designed to settle labor disputes between unions and management. In 1959, Congress passed a law to give NLRB jurisdiction over businesses based on gross receipts. Once a business passes that threshold of gross receipts, it is subject to intervention by the NLRB. Busi- nesses below the threshold are subject to ac- tions brought in state courts, instead of the NLRB. Without an adjustment for inflation, busi- nesses and the NLRB have been caught in ``bracket creep.'' as inflation has increased since 1959, the NLRB has acquired jurisdic- tion over much smaller businesses than was ever intended, escalating the expense and workload for the NLRB as well as for busi- ness. These now include very small busi- nesses, for whom the cost of such interven- tion is unbearable. Up to 20% of the NLRB's workload now is these very small businesses. For example, NLRB has jurisdiction over non-retail businesses with gross receipts over $50,000, an inflation adjustment would raise that threshold to $275,773. NLRB has ju- risdiction over retail business and res- taurants doing more than $500,000 worth of business, but adjusting for inflation since 1959 would raise this to $2.7 million. Congress never intended to subject small businesses to such a have regulatory hammer. The NLRB is powerless to change its juris- diction without an act of Congress. So this legislation will do exactly that. By indexing the jurisdiction to the rate of inflation, the NLRB could again focus upon the larger businesses for whom the law was originally written. Small businesses have been severely burdened by dealing with the far-off NLRB instead of their local state courts (Examples on Reverse). This bill's simple adjustment both frees NLRB deal with significant cases truly af-fecting interstate commerce, and also re- moves the problems very small business have with NLRB oversight (See Example on the Reverse). If you have any questions, please call Mr. Istook`s office and speak with Dr. Bill Duncan at (202) 225\u00b12182.

EXAMPLES OF SMALL BUSINESS NLRB CASES Larry Burns, of Houston, Texas, (8 employ- ees), had 2 charges filed against his business by the NLRB. One was thrown out, the other settled for $160 (1 days pay). Larry Burns spent $11,000 in attorneys fees and wasted time fighting the NLRB when these problems could have been solved cheaper and easier in state courts. Also, Mr. Burns, under state law, could have recovered 1\u00a42of his attorney's fees under loser pays (which helps eliminate frivolous charges). Randall Borman, of Evansville, Indiana (4 employees). Three charges were filed with the NLRB. All were dismissed. He could have recovered all of his legal fees under Indiana state law. Instead he lost $7,500 in attorney's fees and lost revenue and had to lay off workers to cover this expense. EXAMPLES OF DELAYS IN PROCESSING NLRB CASES Julian Burns, of Charlotte, North Carolina, (23 employees). His case should be heard by the NLRB. However, the NLRB`s workload is so overloaded with cases from very small businesses that is took 21\u00a42years to hear his case. Rather than getting his day in court, he settled for $10,000 after paying $35,000 in attorney's fees, and $250,000 for losses in manpower and reduced workforce, for a total cost of $295,000. ACHIEVING NLRB B UDGET SAVINGS BY UPDATING SMALL BUSINESS THRESHOLDS1 The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB or Board) exercises exclusive jurisdic- tion over all labor disputes that are consid- ered to be of significant national interest. The Board, itself, has set the standards for determining which labor disputes reach this threshold. Unfortunately, most of these standards are based on 1959 dollar figures that have not been adjusted for inflation over time. The result is that the Board's method for asserting jurisdiction has become outdated and should be changed to reflect present economic realities. Such a change could result in substantial savings to the U.S. Government. The NLRB's jurisdiction, in both represen- tation and unfair labor practice cases, ex- tends to all enterprises that ``affect'' inter- state commerce.2This expansive statutory grant of authority has been held by the Su- preme Court to mean that the Board's juris- diction extends to ``the fullest . .. breadthconstitutionally permissible under the com- merce clause.''3 Traditionally, however, the Board has never exercised its full authority. Since its establishment, the Board has considered only cases that, in its opinion, ``substan- tially affect'' interstate commerce. In 1959, Congress endorsed this practice in the Labor- Management Reporting and Disclosure Act. The act specifically allowed the Board to ``decline to assert jurisdiction over any labor dispute . .. where . .. the effect of such labor dispute on commerce is not suffi- ciently substantial to warrant the exercise of its jurisdiction.''4Congress did not leave the Board total discretion, however. It in- structed that the Board ``shall not decline to assert jurisdiction over any labor dispute over which it would assert jurisdiction under the standards prevailing upon August 1, 1959.''5 Thus, although Congress recognized that the Board needed to exercise discretion in in- terpreting the term ``affecting commerce,'' it clearly did not want the Board to establish lower thesholds than were already in place. In 1959, however, the Board's prevailing jursidictional thresholds were based on raw dollar amounts. The difficulty with this ju- risdictional approach is that it fails to take inflation into account. The problem with not adjusting jurisdic- tional thresholds is clearly illustrated in the following example. In 1959, the Board exer- cised jurisdiction over non-retail businesses that sold or purchased goods in interstate commerce totaling $50,000 or more annually. In other words, in 1959, $50,000 of interstate business ``substantially affected commerce.'' Today, the Board continues to exercise juris- diction using the $50,000 threshold, but the effect on commerce of $50,000 today is not nearly what it was in 1959. The value of $50,000 today is equivalent to $9,065 in 1959. Thus, just as $9,065 did not warrant the Board's jurisdiction in 1959, $50,000 should not warrant the Board's jurisdiction today. Since 1959, the Board has established sepa- rate thresholds for particular types of busi- nesses that did not fall into the 1959 cat- egories. Although these thresholds are more recent, they nonetheless suffer from the same major flaw\u00d0they fail to consider infla- tion. Figure 1, below, list the Board's current ju- risdictional thresholds for various business sectors along with the year in which those thresholds were established. These sums are then converted into their present value\u00d0 making it clear that the Board's present pro- cedure for asserting jurisdiction is both un- realistic and outdated. Consequently, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 164(c)(1) should be amended to reflect the present value of these jurisdictional thresholds. A second flaw in basing jurisdiction solely on the volume of the employer's business is that such a method fails to consider the size of the bargaining units involved. As a result, the Board spends scarce federal resources pursuing relatively small benefits. Figure 2 clearly illustrates this position. In 1994, the Board expended nearly 20% of its representa- tion effort on bargaining units of 9 persons or less. Yet, this 20% effort reached less than 2% of the total number of employees in- volved in representation elections that year (3,393 out of a total of 188,899). In otherCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0Extensions of Remarks E1062 May 20, 1999 words, the Board could have reduced its ef- fort by 20% while maintaining 98% effective- ness had it declined to assert jurisdiction over these small units. What is even more surprising is that the NLRB conducts elections in units as small astwo workers. The Board refuses to release statistics on this point to the public, but such statistics would be available to the Ap- propriations Committee. Leaving jurisdiction over these small busi- ness units to the states would be most effi-cient use of federal resources and could re- sult in significant savings to the Federal Government.
