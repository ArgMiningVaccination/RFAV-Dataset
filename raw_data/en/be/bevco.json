DISSEMINATION AND BUILDING CAPACITY FOR RESEARCH [Sec. 937.] [42 U.S.C. 299b-37] [(a)] In General.\u2014 (1) Dissemination.\u2014The Office of Communication and Knowledge Transfer (referred to in this section as the \"Office\") at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (or any other relevant office designated by Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality), in consultation with the National Institutes of Health, shall broadly disseminate the research findings that are published by the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute established under section [1181(b)](../ssact/title11/1181.htm#act-1181-b) of the Social Security Act (referred to in this section as the \"Institute\") and other government-funded research relevant to comparative clinical effectiveness research. The Office shall create informational tools that organize and disseminate research findings for physicians, health care providers, patients, payers, and policy makers.

At a minimum, such training shall be in methods that meet the methodological standards adopted under section 1181(d)(9) of the Social Security Act. [(f)] Building Data for Research.\u2014The Secretary shall provide for the coordination of relevant Federal health programs to build data capacity for comparative clinical effectiveness research, including the development and use of clinical registries and health outcomes research data networks, in order to develop and maintain a comprehensive, interoperable data network to collect, link, and analyze data on outcomes and effectiveness from multiple sources, including electronic health records. [(g)] Authority To Contract With the Institute.\u2014Agencies and instrumentalities of the Federal Government may enter into agreements with the Institute, and accept and retain funds, for the conduct and support of research described in this part, provided that the research to be conducted or supported under such agreements is authorized under the governing statutes of such agencies and instrumentalities. * * * * * * * [Sec. 1301.] [42 U.S.C. 300e] [(a)] For purposes of this title, the term \"health maintenance organization\" means a public or private entity which is organized under the laws of any State and which (1) provides basic and supplemental health services to its members in the manner prescribed by subsection (b), and (2) is organized and operated in the manner prescribed by subsection (c). * * * * * * * [(c)] Each health maintenance organization shall\u2014 * * * * * * * (3)(A) enroll persons who are broadly representative of the various age, social, and income groups within the area it serves, except that in the case of a health maintenance organization which has a medically underserved population located (in whole or in part) in the area it serves, not more than 75 per centum of the members of that organization may be enrolled from the medically underserved population unless the area in which such population resides is also a rural area (as designated by the Secretary), and (B) carry out enrollment of members who are entitled to medical assistance under a State plan approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act in accordance with procedures approved under regulations promulgated by the Secretary; * * * * * * * (8) provide, in accordance with regulations of the Secretary (including safeguards concerning the confidentiality of the doctor-patient relationship), an effective procedure for developing, compiling, evaluating, and reporting to the Secretary, statistics and other information (which the Secretary shall publish and disseminate on an annual basis and which the health maintenance organization shall disclose, in a manner acceptable to the Secretary, to its members and the general public) relating to (A) the cost of its operations, (B) the patterns of utilization of its services, (C) the availability, accessibility, and acceptability of its services, (D) to the extent practical, developments in the health status of its members, and (E) such other matters as the Secretary may require. * * * * * * * DEFINITIONS [Sec. 1302.] [42 U.S.C. 300e-1] For purposes of this title: * * * * * * * (7) The term \"medically underserved population\" means the population of an urban or rural area designated by the Secretary as an area with a shortage of personal health services or a population group designated by the Secretary as having a shortage of such services. Such a designation may be made by the Secretary only after consideration of the comments (if any) of (A) each State health planning and development agency which covers (in whole or in part) such urban or rural area or the area in which such population group resides, and (B) each health systems agency designated for a health service area which covers (in whole or in part) such urban or rural area or the area in which such population group resides. (8)(A) The term \"community rating system\" means the systems, described in subparagraphs (B) and (C), of fixing rates of payments for health services. A health maintenance organization may fix its rates of payments under the system described in subparagraph (B) or (C) or under both such systems, but a health maintenance organization may use only one such system for fixing its rates of payments for any one group. (B) A system of fixing rates of payment for health services may provide that the rates shall be fixed on a per-person or per-family basis and may authorize the rates to vary with the number of persons in a family, but, except as authorized in subparagraph (D), such rates must be equivalent for all individuals and for all families of similar composition. (C) A system of fixing rates of payment for health services may provide that the rates shall be fixed for individuals and families by groups. Except as authorized in subparagraph (D), such rates must be equivalent for all individuals in the same group and for all families of similar composition in the same group. If a health maintenance organization is to fix rates of payment for individuals and families by groups, it shall\u2014 (i)(I) classify all of the members of the organization into classes based on factors which the health maintenance organization determines predict the differences in the use of health services by the individuals or families in each class and which have not been disapproved by the Secretary, (II) determine its revenue requirements for providing services to the members of each class established under subclause (I), and (III) fix the rates of payments for the individuals and families of a group on the basis of a composite of the organization's revenue requirements determined under subclause (II) for providing services to them as members of the classes established under subclause (I), or (ii) fix the rates of payments for the individuals and families of a group on the basis of the organization's revenue requirements for providing services to the group, except that the rates of payments for the individuals and families of a group of less than 100 persons may not be fixed at rates greater than 110 percent of the rate that would be fixed for such individuals and families under subparagraph (B) or clause (i) of this subparagraph. The Secretary shall review the factors used by each health maintenance organization to establish classes under clause (i). If the Secretary determines that any such factor may not reasonably be used to predict the use of the health services by individuals and families, the Secretary shall disapprove such factor for such purpose. (D) The following differentials in rates of payments may be established under the systems described in subparagraphs (B) and (C): (i) Nominal differentials in such rates may be established to reflect differences in marketing costs and the different administrative costs of collecting payments from the following categories of members: (I) Individual members (including their families). (II) Small groups of members (as determined under regulations of the Secretary). (III) Large groups of members (as determined under regulations of the Secretary). (ii) Nominal differentials in such rates may be established to reflect the compositing of the rates of payment in a systematic manner to accommodate group purchasing practices of the various employers. (iii) Differentials in such rates may be established for members enrolled in a health maintenance organization pursuant to a contract with a governmental authority under section 1079 or 1086 of title 10, United States Code [[248]](#ft248), or under any other governmental program (other than the health benefits program authorized by chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code) or any health benefits program for employees of States, political subdivision of States, and other public entities. * * * * * * * EMPLOYEES' HEALTH BENEFITS PLANS Sec. 1310.
