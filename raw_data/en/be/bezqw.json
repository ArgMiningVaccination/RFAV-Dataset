New evidences suggest that fuel sensing occurs in a number of peripheral cell types, which include specific taste receptors in the gut. These receptors produce a chemical cascade signaling the central nervous system (CNS) for energy balance regulation. At the same time in the CNS specific brain regions directly sense fuel status. An emerging new methodology investigates neural correlates of appetite and satiety, using functional neuroimaging techniques. In the present work we aim at investigating the brain-gut matrix. First, through a systematic review of the literature, previous studies assessing the effects of nutrients on brain functions were examined to identify a common research methodology and related results. Afterwards we extensively study the effects of sugars and amino acids on the food-reward system, focusing on brain resting state functional connectivity. Finally, we focus on glucose and fructose effects on cognitive functions, by investigating two of the most common dimensions of cognitive functions such as working memory and response inhibition. 6 INTRODUCTION The prevalence of obesity in America is around 35% (Kivim\u00e4ki et al, 2017) and above 20% in the most populated European countries (Blundell et al, 2017). Overweight leads to dramatic health consequences (Hruby and Hu, 2015). Research aiming to understand the basic mechanisms that regulate food intake, appetite and body weight is therefore needed. New evidences suggest that fuel sensing occurs in a number of peripheral cell types, which include specific taste receptors in the gut (Roper and Chaudhari, 2017). These receptors produce a chemical cascade signaling the central nervous system (CNS) for energy balance regulation (Roper and Chaudhari, 2017). At the same time in the CNS specific brain regions directly sense fuel status. There is ample evidence that links levels of glucose to specific populations of neurons in the CNS that are likely to modulate appetite and energy balance (Page et al, 2013). Therefore it is nowadays clear that nutrient-activated gut-to-brain signaling pathways play a major role in the control of digestive function, appetite and energy intake. Specifically, the release of a number of signaling peptides from nutrient sensing glucagon-like peptide-1 nervous system (CNS) to the brainstem and hypothalamus, via both the 7 vagus nerve and the bloodstream, regulating the food-reward networks and regulating satiety and appetite (Chaudhri et al, 2008). Pharmaco-Imaging of nutrients intake. Every time we eat, nutrients trigger different peptides in our gut, which influence various systems in our body, including the central nervous system (CNS) (Cummings and Overduin, 2007). In parallel, the brain regulates our eating behavior by modulating activations in brain regions controlling appetite, food-reward and body weight (Ahima and Antwi, 2008). As stated above, neuroscience began to consider these brain-gut interactions as an inter-dependent system, developing a research line aiming at depicting the effects of different nutrients on specific brain areas, which subsequently influence our (eating) behavior (Page et al, 2013). Functional brain imaging techniques have greatly facilitated the investigation of the human brain-gut interaction in the last decades. The effects of nutrients ingestion on the human brain can now be studied by combining the BOLD signal variation (Blood oxygen level dependent, an indirect marker of neuronal activation) together with the measurement of hormones plasma concentration (Aziz, 2012). A pioneering study of Liu (Liu et al, 2000a) integrated hormones plasma analyses and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination, demonstrating for the first time a direct link between glucose administration, insulin and glucose plasma level modification and BOLD changes in the hypothalamus and the cingulate cortex. These findings suggest that functional 8 MRI (fMRI) can depict the effects of nutrients administration to the functional activity of human brain regions involved in appetite and food-reward pathways. After the first attempt by Liu (Liu et al, 2000a), subsequent neuroimaging studies on the brain-gut matrix reported discrepancies in the methodology (Sizonenko et al, 2013). This is mainly due to the different nutrients ingested and to the different paradigms used during fMRI examination. A general overview of the brain-gut literature and of the methodologies used in the field is therefore necessary. The impact of sugars ingestion on brain functions. Nutrients ingestion is essential for survival and implies the capacity to adjust food intake in response to changing energy requirements due to environmental demanding tasks (Morton et al, 2006). This homeostatic control is regulated by a deep interconnection between cellular, neuronal and behavioural mechanisms that link changes of body fat stores and adaptive adjustments of feeding behaviour to finally comply adaptive tasks. Sugars operate an important role in metabolic processes and changes were reported at the neural level after their ingestion (Liu et al, 2000b). Glucose and fructose, two of the most investigated monosaccharides, have a roughly equal number of calories but are metabolized differently (Luo et al, 2015). While glucose stimulates the secretion of insulin, a hormone that signals the brain to increase satiety and to blunt the reward value of food (Figlewicz and Benoit, 9 2009; Woods et al, 1998), fructose is associated to insulin resistance (Aeberli et al, 2013). Beside the cellular level, the different metabolism of fructose and glucose may explain also their differential effects on neuronal pathways. As a milestone study of Page has documented (Page et al, 2013) investigating neural correlates of appetite, changes in regional cerebral blood flow and increase in functional connectivity after glucose ingestion can be highlighted in regions as the hypothalamus, insula, anterior cingulate, and striatum (appetite and reward regions). Fructose is demonstrated to reduce relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and increase functional connectivity in the posterior cingulate cortex, and visual cortex. Ingestion of glucose compared to fructose resulted in a reduction in hypothalamic cerebral blood flow (Luo et al, 2015). Moreover, sugars may also affect brain areas activations involved in complex tasks, as cognitive functions. This is suggested by behavioural results previously documented in studies on humans and animals (Martin and Benton, 1999; Stollery and Christian, 2016; Woodie and Blythe, 2017). Between the different adaptive skills of the human being, in fact, cognitive functions are essential to process the information coming from the reality, requiring resources to support different levels of complex task performance (Kondraske, 2010). They include several domains as attention, working memory and decision-making (Alhola and Polo-Kantola, 2007). While nutrients ingestion can impact our cognitive functions (le Coutre and Schmitt, 2008; Gomez-Pinilla and Hillman, 2013), no previous 10 studies investigated effects of sugars on brain functions underpinning cognitive processes. The impact of amino acids ingestion on brain functions. Amino acids present in several protein-based meals are essential to the brain to function adequately (Lieberman, 1999). The brain uses amino acids, such as tryptophan and tyrosine, to promote the synthesis of various neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, as serotonin, essential for neuronal firing (Laterra et al, 1999). In particular, it was demonstrated already in the seventies that mono ammine neurotransmitters are synthesized in the brain from aromatic amino acidy, their precursors and that are present in blood vessels (Daniel et al, 1976). Moreover, in highly stressful situations or in pathological conditions, the CNS requirements for amino acids may change and in turn changes in the neurotransmitters synthesis can be detected (Baranyi et al, 2016). In line with these findings, there is evidence that when peripheral concentration of any of the precursors varies, consequences for the brain metabolism, function, and behavior can be observed (Young, 2013). Amino acids, as L-leucine (Mellinkoff et al, 1956; Thimister et al, 1996), L-glutamine and Nuttall, 2010; Greenfield et al, 2009), and L-phenylalanine (Liddle, 2000) modulate appetite in healthy subjects and obese. Previous studies have reported effects on digestive functions (Ballinger and Clark, 1994) and food intake (Colombel et al, 1988) after L-tryptophan intake . 11 L-Tryptophan is an essential amino acids found in food and is the precursor of serotonin (Young, 2013). As the proportion of carbohydrate relative to protein increases, so does the level of brain serotonin. Consistent with alteration of serotonin, the availability of tryptophan to the brain can alter also behavioral factors such as alertness, level of depression, aggression, and pain sensitivity (Jenkins et al, 1987). L-Tryptophan was demonstrated to have an influence on the activity in prefrontal regions that affect cognitive control and emotion processing (Dantzer et al, 2011; Passamonti et al, 2012; Seymour et al, 2012; Williams et al, 2007). In fact, tryptophan depletion is linked to reduced activity in the insula (Kr\u00e4mer et al, 2011), that is involved in decision making in potential aggressive situations and to changes in the DMN that may reduce depressive mood (Kunisato et al, 2011). However, while studies on tryptophan depletion as regulation of serotonin were extensively investigated, no previous studies from our knowledge investigated the effects of amino acids on food-reward mechanism using neuroimaging techniques. While the effects of sugars on the food-reward system are well documented, the effects of amino acids on brain regions involved in satiety and appetite are unknown. In the present work we extensively study the effects of sugars and amino acids on the food-reward system. Afterwards, we focus on glucose and fructose effects 12 on cognitive functions, by investigating two of the most common dimensions of cognitive functions such as working memory and response inhibition. 13 Aim of the present work and hypothesis. The present PhD thesis aims at investigating the brain-gut matrix. First, through a systematic review of the literature, previous studies assessing the effects of nutrients on brain functions were examined to identify a common research methodology and related results. On the basis of previous works, we hypothesized that brain areas involved in the food-reward circuit are activated in opposite directions, by gut peptides linked to satiety or to appetite stimulation. We performed afterwards a set of studies investigating the effects of sugars and amino acids on satiety hormones and Resting state (RS) functional networks involved in appetite regulation. Specifically we focused on the effects of L-Tryptophan and L-Leucine on the human gut-brain system, using a multimodal approach, integrating physiological and neuroimaging data. Finally, we investigated more specifically the effects of sugars on cognitive functions, discriminating their effects on working memory and response inhibition. In particular, as glucose and fructose follow different metabolic processes at the cellular level, at the brain level sugars and amino acids may also act differentially on regions underpinning different neural functions. In the present work, a randomized double-blinded cross-over design was used combining the investigation of gut-hormones with multimodal neuroimaging approach (fMRI) after nutrients administration. The present work is intended to be exploratory aiming at having a global overview of the studies investigating the brain-gut matrix and to set a common ground for future investigations in the field.!!Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/neubiorev Review article The impact of gut hormones on the neural circuit of appetite and satiety: A systematic review Davide (UPK), CH-4012 Basel, Switzerland bDivision of Neuropaediatrics & Developmental Medicine, University Children's Hospital, Basel, Switzerland cCentre de Diagnostic Radiologique de Carouge CDRC, Geneva, Switzerland dFaculty of Medicine of the University of Geneva, Switzerland eDepartment of Surgical Sciences, Radiology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden fDepartment of Neuroradiology, University Hospital Freiburg, Germany gDepartment of Research, St. Claraspital, Switzerland ARTICLE INFO Gut Brain Insulin Ghrelin Leptin Glucose GLP-1 PYY fMRIABSTRACT brain -gut-axis is an interdependent system a ecting neural functions and controlling our eating behaviour. In recent decades, neuroimaging techniques have facilitated its investigation. We systematically looked into functional and neurochemical brain imaging studies investigating how key molecules such in- fluence the function of brain regions regulating appetite and satiety. Of the 349 studies published before July 2016 identi ed in the database search, 40 were included (27 on healthy and 13 on obese subjects). Our systematic review suggests that the plasma level of ghrelin, the gut hormone promoting appetite, is positively correlated with activation in the pre-frontal cortex (PFC), amygdala and insula and negatively cor- related with activation in subcortical areas such as the hypothalamus. In contrast, the plasma levels of glucose, insulin, leptin, PYY, GLP-1 a ect the same brain regions conversely. Our study integrates previous investigations of the gut-brain matrix during food-intake and homeostatic regulation and may be of use for future meta- analyses of brain-gut interactions. 1. Introduction The brain -gut axis is an interdependent system that a ects neural function and controls our eating behaviour through biochemical sig- nalling between the endocrine and nervous system through hormonal peptides in the gastrointestinal tract ( Huda et al., 2006; Steinert et al., 2017; Wren and Bloom, 2007 ). The two main families of gastro- intestinal (GI) hormones are a) Appetite stimulators, such as ghrelin, a 28 amino acid peptide that promotes meal initiation by increasing ap- petite and hunger feelings ( Cummings et al., 2001; Kojima et al., 1999 ), and b) Satiety stimulators, that signal the brain to decrease hunger and promote meal cessation ( Figlewicz, 2003; Woodset al., 1998 ). Next to these GI hormones, insulin, a pancreatic hormone, as well as insulin regulated glucose, play a major role in human me- tabolism and eating behaviour ( Figlewicz, 2003; Woods et al., 1998 ). Neuroimaging techniques have greatly facilitated the investigation of human brain -gut interactions in recent decades. Pioneering studies (Liu et al., 2000 ) combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with hormonal blood analyses have demonstrated a direct link between changes in plasma concentrations in hormones and modi ca- tions in brain regions that are part of the neural circuit of appetite, as identi ed by Woods et al. (1998) . In particular, increased insulin plasma levels are linked to changes in brain activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), in the sen- sorimotor cortex and in the hypothalamus. On the other hand, it is well established that ghrelin ( Malik et al., 2008 ) acts through the http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2017.06.013 Received 11 February 2017; Received in revised form 8 June 2017; Accepted 27 June 2017Corresponding authors.

These ndings suggest that di erent gut peptides divergently modulate brain activation in the neural circuit controlling appetite and thereby regulate our prospective eating beha- viour. However, studies often report inconsistent ndings making a gen- eral interpretation di cult. There are di erent reasons for the dis- crepancies: study designs have been variable with di erent nutrients ingested (stimulating di erent gut peptides) and di erent paradigms have been used during fMRI examination. A general overview of the di erent studies and of the methodologies used in the eld is therefore necessary. In the present study, we systematically reviewed functional and neurochemical brain imaging studies investigating how the main gut peptides (ghrelin, PYY3-36, leptin, GLP-1 and CCK), insulin and glucose influence activation in brain regions regulating appetite and satiety inhealthy and obese subjects. On the basis of the ndings of these studies, we hypothesised that the brain areas involved in the food-reward cir- cuit, such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the insula and the hypothalamus, are activated in opposite directions, by gut peptides linked to satiety or to appetite stimulation. 2. Methods To ensure high quality reporting, PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews were followed ( Moher et al., 2015 ). 2.1. Search strategy An electronic search was performed using the PubMed database. The following search terms were used: ((ghrelin OR glucose OR insulin OR peptide YY OR leptin OR GLP-1 OR cholecystokinin) AND (appetite OR satiety)) AND (mri OR fmri OR pet OR spect OR imaging OR neu- roimaging). All studies published before July 2016 were included, Fig. 1. Flowchart of the selection procedure.D. Zanchi et al. 1HXURVFLHQFH\u0003DQG\u0003%LREHKDYLRUDO\u00035HYLHZV\u0003\u001b\u0013\u0003 \u0015\u0013\u0014\u001a \u0003\u0017\u0018\u001a\u00b2 \u0017\u001a\u0018 \u0017\u0018\u001bwithout any language restriction. Additionally, the reference lists of all included studies identi ed in the database search were manually screened for relevant studies. 2.2. Selection criteria and study selection The review included original publications in peer reviewed journals, observational or interventional study designs and applications of functional or neurochemical neuroimaging techniques. All the included articles used a randomised double-blinded placebo-controlled design. Based on previous studies and on the existing literature ( Huda et al., 2006; Jenkins et al., 1987; Wren and Bloom, 2007 ), one gut peptide regulating (peptide YY, leptin, GLP-1, CCK), as well as insulin and glucose, were investigated. The current review focuses on how changes in plasma concentration of gut hormones result in modi cations of brain functions regulating ap- petite and satiety. After inspection for duplicates, the titles and abstracts of all records were reviewed. Publications that clearly did not meet inclusion criteria were excluded. The decision for inclusion or exclusion of the remaining publications was made on the basis of a review of the full texts. The whole process was independently conducted by two reviewers (DZ, SB). In case of disagreement, reviewers discussed their reasons for initial inclusion and exclusion. If consensus was not reached, a third reviewer (AS) was included. 2.3. Recorded variables, data extraction and analysis The recorded variables for each article included in the review were: authors and year of publication, study design, assessed peptides, ad- ministered substance, amount of nutrient received, modality of ad- ministration, imaging method, number of healthy subjects, number of obese subjects, gender distribution, age, Body max index (BMI), brain region investigated, analysed brain regions, statistical thresholds and main ndings. If overlaps between subjects were suspected but the original publications did not contain information on that topic, we contacted the authors and included the obtained data in the review. 3. Results 3.1. Identi ed studies Of 343 publications found in the PubMed database and 6 articles identi ed in the reference lists, 40 articles were included in this review. 244 publications did not meet the inclusion criteria (e.g. animal models, case reports, review articles, pathological conditions) and were thus excluded. 66 studies were excluded since they investigated appe- tite without including any brain examination or hormone administra- tion. Aflowchart of the selection procedure, with the included and ex- cluded studies, is shown in Fig. 1 . 3.2. Study characteristics Of the 40 included articles, 17 studies used fMRI with a \"food-cue paradigm \"(van Bloemendaal et al., 2014; De Silva et al., 2011; Douglas et al., 2015; Goldstone et al., 2014; Grosshans et al., 2012 Heni et al., 2014 ,2015, p. 201 ;Hinkle et al., 2013; Karra et al., et al., et al., et al., 2011; Rosenbaum et al., 2008; Wallner-Liebmann et al., 2010 ), an\"on-otreatment related block design \"(Batterham et al., 2007; Eldeghaidy et al., 2016; Jones et al., 2012; Lassman et al., 2010; Li et al., 2012; Little et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2000; Purnell et al., 2011; Spetter et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2014 ),ve a resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) paradigm ( Jastrebo et al., 2016 ;Page et al., 2013 ;W\u00f6lnerhanssen et al., 2015 ;Wright et al., 2016 ;Zhang et al., 2015 ) and vestudies anfMRI-ASL (arterial spin ( Jastrebo et al., 2016; Lennerz et al., 2013; Page et al., 2009, 2013; Schilling et al., 2014 ). Four were neurochemical imaging studies using positron emission tomography ( Gautier et al., al., Savage et al., 2014; Tataranni et al., 1999 ). All included studies were published between 2007 and 2016. 13 studies investigated the e ect of the appetite-stimulating hormone ghrelin ( Batterham et al., 2013a,b, 2015; Leidy et al., 2013; Li et al., 2012; Malik et al., 2008; Savage et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2014, 2015 ), while 30 studies investigated the impact of satiety-indu- cing hormones and glucose ( Batterham et al., 2007; van Bloemendaal et al., 2014; De Silva et al., 2011; Douglas et al., 2015; Eldeghaidy et al., al., al., 2012; al., 2014, et al., al., et al., 2013; Li et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2000; Page et al., 2009, 2011, 2013; Pannacciulli et al., 2007; Purnell et al., 2010; W\u00f6lnerhanssen et al., 2015; Wright et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2015 ). Eight studies focused on glucose ( Gautier et al., 2000; Heni et al., 2014; al., 2013; et al., 2011; Purnell et al., 2011; Wallner-Liebmann et al., 2010; Wright et al., 2016 ), 15 on insulin ( van Bloemendaal et al., et 2013a; Lennerz et al., 2013; Li et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2000; Page et al., 2009, 2013; Schilling et al., 2014; Tataranni et al., 1999; Wallner-Liebmann et al., 2010; W\u00f6lnerhanssen et al., 2015; al., 2015 ), four on peptide YY (Batterham et al., 2007; De Silva et al., 2011; Douglas et al., 2015; Leidy et al., 2013 ),ve on leptin ( Grosshans et al., 2012; Hinkle et al., 2016; Kroemer et al., 2008 on GLP-1 ( van Bloemendaal et al., 2014; Douglas et al., 2015 ;Heni et al., 2015, p. 2 ;Li et al., 2012; Pannacciulli et al., 2007 ) on Eldeghaidy et al., 2016; Lassman et al., 2010; Li et al., 2012; Little et al., 2014 ). To assess brain changes associated with these gut peptides, a broad variety of nutrients with extensive di erences in protein load were administered. In 16 studies, subjects directly received the target nu- trient (such as glucose) ( Batterham et al., 2007; Silva et al., 2011; Eldeghaidy et al., 2016; Heni et al., 2014, 2015; Hinkle et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2012; Kroemer et al., 2013a,b; Little et al., 2014; Malik et al., 2008; Page et al., 2009, 2011, 2013; Rosenbaum et al., 2008; Schilling et al., 2014 ), while in 24 studies subjects consumed standar- dised meals (containing for instance: bres, soy or chocolate milkshake) with di erent amounts of protein ( van Bloemendaal et al., 2014; Douglas et al., et Pannacciulli et al., 2007; Purnell et al., 2011; Savage et al., 2014; Schilling et al., 2014; Spetter et al., 2014; Sun al., 2014, et al., 1999; Wallner- Liebmann et al., 2010; Wright et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2015 ). As regards the modality of administration, 12 studies used an in- 2013; Karra et al., 2013; Kojima et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2000; Nakazato et al., 2001; Spetter et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2015 ), in 22 studies the substances were ingested orally ( Douglas et al., 2015; Eldeghaidy et al., al., et al., 2013; Li et al., 2012; Little et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2000; Page et al., 2013; Pannacciulli et al., 2007; Schilling et al., 2014; Spetter et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2014, 2015; Tataranni et al., 1999; Wright et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2015 ), in three studies a nasogastric tube was used ( Lassman et al., 2010 ;Spetter et al., 2014 ;W\u00f6lnerhanssen et al., 2015 ), Zanchi et al. 1HXURVFLHQFH\u0003DQG\u0003%LREHKDYLRUDO\u00035HYLHZV\u0003\u001b\u0013\u0003 \u0015\u0013\u0014\u001a \u0003\u0017\u0018\u001a\u00b2 three administration was Grosshans et al., 2012; Savage et al., 2014; Wallner-Liebmann et al., 2010 ). The time between nutrient administration and brain imaging examination varied as well: in 14 studies, the neuroimaging examination started immediately after nutrient administration ( Batterham et al., 2007; van Bloemendaal et et al., 2015; Gautier et al., 2000; Jastrebo et al., 2016; Jones et al., 2012; Lassman et al., 2010; Li et al., 2012; Malik et al., 2008; Page et al., 2013 , 2011; Purnell et al., 2011; Spetter et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015 ), while in the other 20 brain signals were recorded 5-120 min after nutrient administration ( De Silva et al., Eldeghaidy et et al., et al., 2013a,b; Lennerz et al., 2013; Little et al., 2014; Page et al., 2009; Pannacciulli et al., 2007; Schilling et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2014, 2015; Tataranni et al., 1999; W\u00f6lnerhanssen et al., 2015; Wright et al., 2016 ). Three studies investigated long-term e ects by focusing on an administration period between 6 days and 5 weeks ( Hinkle et al., 2013; Leidy et al., 2013; Rosenbaum et al., 2008 ). As stated above, three studies did not administer any treatment ( Grosshans et al., 2012; Savage et al., 2014; Wallner-Liebmann et al., 2010 ). 13 studies included obese participants beside healthy subjects ( van Bloemendaal et al., Gautier et al., et al., 2012; al., 2014, et al., et al., 2016; Lennerz et al., 2013; Rosenbaum et al., 2008; Savage et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2015; Wallner-Liebmann et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2015 ), while 27 studies focused only on healthy controls( Batterham et al., 2007; De Silva et al., 2011; Douglas et al., 2015; Eldeghaidy et al., 2016; Goldstone et al., et al., 2013; Li et al., 2012; Little et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2000; Malik et al., 2008; Page et al., 2009, 2011, 2013; Pannacciulli et al., 2007; Purnell et al., 2011; Schilling et al., 2014; Spetter et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2014; Tataranni et al., 1999; W\u00f6lnerhanssen et al., 2015; Wright et al., 2016 ). Details are shown in Table 1 . 3.3. E ects of appetite-inducing hormones on the brain: ghrelin Of the 10 fMRI studies investigating the e ects of ghrelin on healthy subjects, four used a food cue paradigm ( Table 2 ). The 'food cue paradigm ', also called \"food-picture paradigm \", refers to a block design in which high/low-energy-dense food pictures were shown in alterna- tion to non-food pictures in a randomised fashion during the fMRI ex- amination. This approach was used for the rst time by Malik et al. (2008) to investigate the e ect of ghrelin on brain areas controlling appetite. After placebo (saline) administration, 0.5 mg/kg of ghrelin were in- jected with a peripheral venous cannula to 21 male healthy participants over a period of 20 min. In a food-cue paradigm, fMRI was performed during both the placebo and ghrelin conditions. Appetite scores were taken regularly during the blood-fMRI examination. Ghrelin increased the neural response to food pictures in di erent regions of the brain, including the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior insula, and striatum, which are all implicated in encoding the incentive value of food cues. Moreover, the amygdala and OFC responses to ghrelin were positively correlated with subjects 'self-rated hunger ratings. The re- lationship between enhanced levels of plasma ghrelin and corticolimbic activity is con rmed by a similar study of Goldstone et al. (2014) on 21 healthy participants receiving ghrelin or saline injection, in which in- creased OFC and hippocampus activity were observed after acute ghrelin administration. Furthermore, two overlapping fMRI studies of Kroemer et al. (2013a, 2015) using the same study population (26 healthy controls, 13 women) investigated how glucose and nicotine induced changes in ghrelin plasma levels and in brain responses during the presentation of food-related cues. In the rst study ( Kroemer et al., 2013a ), fMRI in a food-cue paradigm was performed after overnight fasting and after astandardised caloric intake (75 g of glucose). Fasting levels of ghrelin correlated positively with food-cue reactivity in the OFC and in the limbic and paralimbic regions, in which ghrelin receptors are densely concentrated. Moreover, fasting ghrelin levels were associated with an increase in subjective appetite. In the second study ( Kroemer et al., 2015 ), nicotine (2 mg) was administered to fasting subjects and after meal consumption. During fasting, nicotine administration weakened the correlations between ghrelin levels and brain activity in the mesocorticolimbic system (hy- pothalamus and nucleus accumbens). In contrast, after meal adminis- tration, nicotine increased the correlation between ghrelin plasma and activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and in the amygdala. These that nicotine a ects how ghrelin modulates the neural responses of appetite. Furthermore, ve studies used an 'on-otreatment related block design 'during fMRI examination to investigate the e ects of ghrelin on brain areas controlling appetite and satiation. Nutrients are adminis- tered during the fMRI examination and the timing of ghrelin plasma absorption is used to investigate the brain response. This approach was used for the rst time by Batterham et al. (2007) to investigate the eects of ghrelin on brain activity after placebo and PYY administration (Batterham et al., 2007 ) on eight healthy males. Ghrelin levels were negatively correlated with activation in the hypothalamus, ventral tegmental areas and brainstem after PYY administration. Furthermore, a negative correlation was shown between activity in these areas and satiety levels. These ndings are con rmed by the study of Jones et al. (2012) using the same paradigm, in which an intravenous infusion of ghrelin (1.25 pmol/kg/min) was injected before and after intragastric administration of lipids (dodecanoate, C 12) to 20 healthy subjects. During digestion, a decrease in appetite was negatively correlated with activity in the midbrain, thalamus, hypothalamus, insula, amygdala and hippocampus. Two studies using the same sample size ( Sun et al., 2014, 2015 ) investigated e ects of ghrelin on 32 healthy individuals before and after meal ingestion using the same paradigm. During the fMRI examination, two di erent milkshake flavours (chocolate and strawberry) were ad- ministered. Larger post-prandial reductions in ghrelin plasma levels were associated with a reduced response to the chocolate milkshake in brain regions, including the midbrain, amygdala, pallidum, hippo- campus, insula and medial OFC. Using the same paradigm, Li et al. (2012) investigated how ingested fat, glucose, protein, and water modulated brain activation in 14 healthy men. In line with previous ndings ( Sun et al., 2014 ), activation in the middle insula, amygdala and lateral OFC also correlated with changes in ghrelin levels after fat administration and glucose. Although this study did not demonstrate a direct correlation between cerebral activity and plasma ghrelin levels and appetite, it showed that ghrelin levels decreases after nutrient ad- ministration. Leidy et al. (2013) used fMRI to con rm these results, by exploring brain activation in response to food cues in 20 late adolescent girls who consumed either a normal protein breakfast, a high protein breakfast, or who skipped breakfast continuously for six days. In agreement with previous evidence, ghrelin plasma levels decreased after the high pro- tein breakfast, and reduced activation was observed in the amygdala, hippocampus and para-hippocampus. Finally one PET study focused on ghrelin and brain-related neuro- chemical changes ( Savage et al., 2014 ). This study included 8 subjects of normal weight and 19 obese subjects and investigated midbrain dopaminergic neurons (DA type 2/type 3 receptor (D2/D3R)). In healthy individuals, fasting ghrelin correlated negatively with dopa- minergic binding potential in the midbrain and nucleus accumbens. 3.4.

Six studies investigated the e ects of glucose plasma levels on the brain. In 2011, Page et al. (2011) administered glucose and insulin to induce a hypoglycaemic or euglycemic status in 21 healthy subjects. A food cue paradigm was used to investigate brain responses during these two conditions. Hypoglycaemia preferentially activated limbic-striatal brain regions (such as the insula, putamen, hypothalamus, caudate) in response to food cues to produce greater desire for high calorie food, while euglycemia preferentially activated the medial prefrontal cortex and resulted in less interest in food stimuli. In the milestone fMRI study of Liu et al. (2000) , glucose was ad- ministered to 21 healthy volunteers in an 'on-otreatment related block design '. Temporal clustering analysis showed increased activation in the OFC, frontal lobe and decreased activation in the hypothalamus after glucose intake. Moreover, before glucose intake, plasma insulin levels correlated negatively with activity in the hypothalamus. Woelnerhanssen et al. (2011) used an RS paradigm to explore the eects of acute glucose and fructose administration on the connectivity within the basal ganglia network of 12 healthy participants. They found that after glucose and fructose administration, a glucose-induced in- crease in rsFC was present the left caudatus, left putamen, precuneus and lingual gyrus and relative to placebo the glucose-induced increase in functional connectivity within the basal ganglia/limbic network correlated positively with glucose-induced insulin release. Wright et al. (2016) conrmed these results by showing that the con- nectivity between the left hypothalamus and the superior frontal gyrus was negatively correlated with glucose plasma levels during fasting sessions. In a 2009 study on nine healthy subjects ( Page et al., 2009 ), Page used an fMRI-ASL sequence to show that increases in glucose blood levels lead to regional increases in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the cerebellum and decreases in the hypothalamus, inferior frontal gyrus, and anterior cingulate cortex. In a study of 2013 ( Page et al., 2013 ) on 20 HC, the author con rmed the previous results. After a drink con- taining glucose or fructose, regional CBF was reduced pothalamus, anterior cingulate, and striatum after glucose or fructose compared to baseline. Moreover, changes in the levels of plasma insulin correlated negatively with changes in regional CBF in the caudate and putamen in response to glucose ingestion. Seven studies investigated the e ects of insulin plasma levels on brain activity. In a study conducted in 2013 ( Kroemer et al., 2013b ), \"to investigate brain modi cations after changes in insulin levels. fMRI was used to investigate reactivity to food cues after overnight fasting and following a standardised caloric intake (i.e., a 75 g oral glucose) in 26 participants. Increased plasma insulin levels correlated negatively with activity in the bilateral fusiform gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus and the limbic system. In addition, activation in these regions was accompanied by lower sub- jective appetite ratings. In the same line, Wallner-Liebmann et al. (2010) showed that during high caloric food cues, insulin levels are positively associated with hippocampal activity and negatively with activity in the right superior frontal gyrus and left thalamus in 12 healthy adolescents. Using an 'on-otreatment related block design 'in a study on 14 healthy subjects, Li et al. (2012) showed that levels of plasma insulin after glucose administration correlated negatively with activity in the middle insula, thalamus, amygdala and lateral OFC, and -after protein administration -with activity in the caudate. In the same line, in the study of Purnell et al. (2011) on nine healthy individuals, increased activation in the OFC and increases in plasma glucose and insulin levels were observed during glucose infusion. Spetter et al. (2014) demon- strated that insulin responses following naso-gastric infusion of cho- colate milk to 16 healthy individuals correlated positively with brain activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and putamen andTable 1 (continued) Author and year Sample size HC size Obese N(m) age BMI 21(12) 31.4 \u00b1 7.9 25.2 \u00b1 4 Page et al.

Intranasal administration of insulin led to increased CSF in the insular cortex and putamen in 48 male volunteers. Finally, one study used PET to investigate the e ects of insulin plasma changes on brain activity. Tataranni et al. (1999) investigated brain neurochemical changes after satiation (liquid meal intake) or in the fasting state in 11 healthy subjects. Satiation was associated with increased CBF in the ventromedial dorsolateral pre- frontal cortex, and inferior parietal lobule. Furthermore, changes in plasma insulin concentrations in response to the meal were negatively correlated with changes in CBF in the insular and OFC. A recent study of Kromer, as previously discussed ( Kroemer et al., 2015 ), used fMRI to investigate e ects of leptin on food-cue reactivity before and after a caloric load (oral glucose tolerance test, OGTT) in 26 healthy normal weight never-smokers. During fasting, nicotine admin- istration increased correlations between leptin levels and activation in the mesocorticolimbic system. After the OGTT, nicotine increased the eects of leptin on food-induced cortex (vmPFC) and the amygdala. Nicotine therefore enhances the e ect of leptin, which might in turn reduce appetite. Five studies investigated the e ects of PYY and GLP-1 plasma levels on the brain. De Silva et al. (2012) , using the \"food cue paradigm \"during fMRI examination, and demonstrated that PYY and GLP-17-36 administra- tion to 16 healthy subjects reduced appetite and in turn altered brain activity was present in areas as the amygdala, caudate, insula, nucleus accumbens, OFC and putamen. Similar ndings were also found in the study of Leidy, as previously described ( Leidy et al., 2013 ), which de- monstrated that increased PYY plasma concentrations were with activity in the amygdala, hippocampal and para-hip- pocampal areas. Douglas et al. (2015) conrmed these results, using the same paradigm, and showed that high protein meal (beef lunch) in- creased GLP-1 and PYY3-36 plasma levels and in turn reduced activity in the anterior cingulate and insula in 21 healthy subjects. Moreover, GLP-1 levels correlated negatively with activation in the middle insula and lateral OFC after both glucose and protein administration. On the contrary, Batterham et al. (2007) , using the 'on-otreatment related block design ', showed that with high plasma PYY concentrations, mi- micking the fed state, there was increased neural activity in the cau- dolateral OFC (as insula and anterior cingulate cortex). In a fMRI-ASL on 42 healthy participants, Pannacciulli et al. (2007) showed that, in the postprandial state, there was an increased plasma concentration of GLP-1, which was positively correlated with increased rCBF in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (including the left middle and inferior frontal gyri) and hypothalamus. Finally, four studies investigated CCK e ects at the brain level. A study previously reported by Li et al. (2012) using an 'on-otreatment related block design 'on 14 healthy subjects, showed that levels of plasma CCK after glucose administration correlated negatively with activity in the caudate and in the thalamus. Moreover, in a work of Eldeghaidy on 17 healthy adults, an fMRI examination was performed assessing how prior consumption of an HFM or water load modulates reward, homeostatic, and taste brain responses to the subsequent de- livery of oral fat. Their ndings show that an individual 's plasma CCK concentration correlated negatively with brain activation in taste and oral somatosensory areas, insula, amygdala and thalamus. A similar study of Little et al. (2014) administering to 12 healthy subjects an intragastric infusion (250 mL) of 1 M glucose and predosing with dex- loxiglumide (CCK receptor antagonist) or 1 M glucose + placebo, or 0.9% saline (control) + placebo, highlighted a CCK1-receptorTable 2 (continued) Authors and year of publicationNeuro- imaging modalityBrain region investigated Type of analysis Threshold Results (HC, if not indicated otherwise) Middle Frontal Gyrus Li orbito-frontal brain + ROIs (insula, amygdala) GLMCorrelationsp satiety the brain: glucose, insulin, peptide YY, leptin and GLP-1.

Lastly, a study of Lassman et al. (2010) , investigating the brain activation responses to ingested lipid (dodeca- noic acid) or saline (control) on 19 healthy subjects with and without prior administration of the CCK receptor antagonist dexloxiglumide, showed signi cant interaction of stem, hypothalamus, precuneus, cingulate cortex, temporal gyrus and caudate. The main areas involved in the neural circuit of appetite and target of the gut peptides are shown in Fig. 2 . 3.5. E ects of gut peptides on the brain in patients with obesity 13 of the included studies focused on the neural e ects of gut peptides in obese subjects ( Bloemendaal et al., et al., 2012; al., 2014, et al., et al., 2016; Lennerz et al., 2013; Rosenbaum et al., 2008; Savage et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2015; Wallner-Liebmann et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2015 ). Three studies were conducted to test the eects of ghrelin on brain areas of obese subjects in comparison to lean subjects ( Jastrebo et al., 2016; Karra et al., 2013; Savage et al., 2014 ). Karra et al. (2013) investigated the relation between changes in plasma ghrelin concentrations and obesity, focusing on the obesity-associated gene (FTO). This fMRI study examined how brain responses to food cues di ered between 12 carriers of the AA genotype and 12 carriers of the TT allele after consumption of a standard meal. During the fasted state, activation in the hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, cingulate gyrus and OFC correlated positively with ghrelin levels in the AA group and with greater feelings of hunger. These results show that the FTO gene and ghrelin are key mediators of ingestive behaviour. Jastrebo et al. (2016) tested how glucose and fructose adminis- tration modulated brain perfusion in 14 lean and 24 obese subjects. Obese patients showed high levels of perfusion in the hypothalamus and thalamus that was related to high plasma concentrations of ghrelin, while low levels of perfusion in the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex were linked to low plasma levels of ghrelin ( Jastrebo et al., 2016; Savage et al., 2014 ). Furthermore, Savage and colleagues found di erent brain responses between lean and obese subjects with respect to ghrelin plasma levels ( Savage et al., 2014 ). Using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, they investigated the expression of DA type 2/t 3 receptors (D2/D3R) in eight subjects with normal weight compared to 19 obese subjects. Ghrelin levels and D2/D3R binding potential (BPND) in the substantia nigra were positivelyTable 3 (continued) Authors and year of publicationNeuroimaging modalityTested hormone Brain region investigated Type of analysis Threshold Results (HC, if not indicated otherwise) striatum) Tataranni et a. 1999) PET Insulin Whole brain Correlations p 0.001 uncorrected for multiple comparisonsSatiation insulin changes a minimum cluster size of 15 voxelsHigh caloric food images, insulin: Hippocampus R Insula L et Dual < 0.05 uncorrected Thalamus Wright et al.

On the other hand, 11 studies investigated di erences in brain ac- tivation in obese subjects compared to lean subjects in relation to changes in glucose and satiety hormones ( van Bloemendaal et al., et al., 2012; al., 2014, et al., et al., al., 2013; Rosenbaum et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2015 ). In one study, both ghrelin and insulin were measured ( Jastrebo et al., 2016 ). Lennerz et al. (2013) focussed on glucose plasma levels and ex- plored resting state connectivity in 12 overweight men after a high glycaemic (high GI) or a low glycaemic meal (low GI). Compared with a low GI meal, a high GI meal decreased plasma glucose, increased hunger and enhanced activation in the nucleus accumbens, striatum and olfactory area. Heni et al. (2014, 2015) explored the e ects of glucose ingestion on brain activity in 12 lean and 12 obese subjects, using a fMRI food-in- duced paradigm. The hypothalamic response to high caloric food cues correlated negatively with changes in blood glucose levels 30 min after glucose ingestion, while activation in the ACC and OFC correlated ne- gatively with increased plasma insulin levels 120 min after glucose ingestion. These e ects can be observed in both the obese and lean groups. In a similar study, Jastrebo et al. (2016) , con rmed these results, by showing that obese adolescents exhibited decreased CBF in the PFC, striatum and hypothalamus after drinking glucose. The hip- pocampus, an area implicated in the processing of high caloric food pictures, was also identi ed by Wallner-Liebmann et al. (2010) ), which found a positive correlation between hippocampus activity and waist circumference. Insulin-related brain changes were also investigated by Gautier et al. (2000) in a study on 11 lean and 11 obese subjects, that combined PET and fMRI-ASL sequences after fasting or satiation (liquid meal). A converse correlation was found between changes in plasma insulin concentrations and changes in rCBF in the precuneus, orbitofrontal cortex, putamen and thalamus in obese and lean subjects. This study raises the possibility that activation in OFC (involved in the inhibition of inappropriate response tendencies) and limbic/paralimbic areas (associated with the regulation of emotion) during eating may be dif- ferent in obese and lean men. As regards leptin, and using fMRI in a food cue paradigm, Grosshans et al. (2012) showed that plasma leptin levels were associated with brain activation in the ventral striatum and with BMI in 21 obese subjects. According to this study, leptin is therefore a satiety hormone linked to increased activation in subcortical regions and to weight gain. In the same line, and with fMRI in a food-cue paradigm, Rosenbaum et al. (2008) examined how brain responses to food cues were modu- lated after subcutaneous injection of leptin in six obese subjects fol- lowing a diet. During weight loss, leptin-related increases in neural activity in response to visual food cues were observed in the brain stem, parahippocampal gyrus, inferior and middle hypothalamus, cingulate gyrus, and middle frontal gyrus. A recent study by Hinkle et al. (2013) conrms these results and investigated changes in the connectivity of the right hypothalamus in respect to leptin plasma levels in 10 obese subjects. Using fMRI with a food cue paradigm, the functional connectivity of the right hypotha- lamus with the mid-insula and the central and parietal operculae in- creased after leptin injections, while it decreased with the OFC, frontal pole and the dorsal ACC. Apart from insulin, e ects of changes in GLP-1 plasma levels on the brain have also been investigated in obese subjects. van Bloemendaal et al. (2014) explored how the administration of the GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide modulated brain responses to food pictures during a somatostatin pancreatic-pituitary clamp in 16 obese and 16 normal- weight subjects. Relative to lean subjects, obese subjects showed in- creased brain responses to food pictures in the insula, amygdala, pu- tamen, and OFC. In the same line, in a second study performed in 2015,Heni et al. (2015) administered 75 g of glucose to promote GLP-1 se- cretion. Food cue-induced brain activity was assessed with fMRI and GLP-1 concentrations measured before, 30 and 120 min after glucose intake. The signi cant increase in GLP-1 levels correlated negatively with a change in the food cue-induced brain activity in the OFC in lean and overweight participants. In contrast, postprandial changes in plasma insulin were associated with OFC activations in lean individuals only. Finally, using rsfMRI, Zhang et al. (2015) investigated the am- plitude of low frequency fluctuations of spontaneous signals during both hunger and satiety states in 20 lean and 20 obese males. Before food intake, obese men had signi cantly higher baseline activity in the precuneus and lower activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) relative to lean subjects. After food intake, obese males had signicantly lower activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) than lean males. Moreover a signi cant positive correlation was found between precuneus activation and hunger ratings before food intake, while dACC activity was negatively correlated with plasma in- sulin levels before and after food intake in both groups. These results indicated that both precuneus and dACC may play an important role in eating behaviour. While precuneus seemed to mediate subjective sa- tiety, dACC activation rather re flected indirect measures of glucose utilisation. 4. Discussion To our knowledge, this is the rst study to systematically review the eects of di erent gut peptides on brain activation in healthy and obese subjects. Forty original studies were retrieved, which addressed how key gut hormones or nutrients, such as ghrelin, glucose, insulin, leptin, PYY, GLP-1 and CCK, modulate functional brain activation after food intake. Plasma levels of the appetite-promoting gut hormone ghrelin positively correlate with activity in the PFC, amygdala and insula and negatively correlate with activity in subcortical areas such as the hy- pothalamus. In contrast, satiety-regulating gut hormones or nutrients like glucose, insulin, letpin, PYY, GLP-1 and CCK a ect the same brain regions in the opposite directions. Nevertheless, the lack of re- producible studies and the existence of multiple methodological ap- proaches prevent de nitive conclusions and explains some dis- crepancies in the results between the di erent studies. The present review is to be considered as the basis for a future meta-analysis of brain-gut interactions. 4.1. Nutrient administration Individual nutrients were administered to stimulate the plasma re- lease of the investigated hormones. In particular, 22 studies used direct administration of the target substance (i.e. glucose) ( Batterham et al., 2007; van Bloemendaal et al., 2014; Silva et al., Eldeghaidy et al., 2016; Goldstone et al., 2014; al., 2014, 2015; Hinkle et al., 2013; Jastrebo et al., 2016; al., al., 2013a,b, 2015; Lennerz et al., 2013; Malik et al., 2008 Page et al., 2009, 2011 ,2013, p. 200 ;Purnell et al., 2011 ;Rosenbaum et al., 2008 ; Schilling et al., 2014 ;W\u00f6lnerhanssen et al., 2015 ) and 16 the admin- istration of a nutrient (for instance chocolate milkshake) that subse- quently stimulated the production of gut peptides (i.e. ghrelin and PYY) (Douglas et al., 2015; Gautier et 2013; Leidy et al., 2013; Li et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2000; Pannacciulli et al., 2007; Savage et al., 2014; Spetter et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2014, 2015; Tataranni et al., 1999; Wallner-Liebmann et al., 2010; Wright et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2015 ). Studies also employed dierent administration schemes: while in 12 studies the administration was intragastric or intravenous ( Batterham et al., 2007; van al., De Silva et al., 2012; Goldstone et al., 2014; Hinkle et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2012; Malik et al., 2008; Page et al., 2009, 2011; Purnell et al., 2011; Rosenbaum et al., 2008; Schilling et al., 2014; W\u00f6lnerhanssen et al., 2015 ), in 24 al., et al., 2013; Li et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2000; Page et al., 2013; Pannacciulli et al., 2007; Savage et al., 2014; Spetter et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2014, 2015; Tataranni et al., 1999; Wallner-Liebmann et al., 2010; Wright et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2015 ). Oral intake aimed to mimic the consumption of daily meals, whereas intragastric/intravenous administration aimed to directly assess the eects of the target hormones. The di erence in the acquisition pro- cedure leads to two main consequences in the comparison of the stu- dies: a) intragastric/intravenous administration could lead to un- comfortable feelings and therefore in fluence data acquisition, b) dierences in the timing of nutrient absorption leads to di erences in the timing of the fMRI examination (immediately after nutrient ad- ministration or after 10, 30, 120 min). 4.2. Di erences in the paradigm during the fMRI examination Dierent paradigms were used during the neuroimaging examina- tion to investigate the e ects of gut peptides on brain activation. 16 studies ( van Bloemendaal et al., 2014; De Silva et al., 2011; Douglas et al., 2015; Goldstone et al., 2014; Grosshans et al., 2012; al., 2014, et al., al., al., et al., et al., et al., 2011; Rosenbaum et al., 2008; Wallner-Liebmann et al., 2010 ) used a \"food- cue paradigm \"to investigate e ects of gut peptides on feelings of ap- petite and neural activity during high and low caloric food cues. The \"food-cue paradigm \"refers to a block design in which high/low energy dense food pictures were shown alternatively to non-food pictures in a randomised fashion during the fMRI examination. On the other hand, 9 studies ( Batterham et al., 2007; Eldeghaidy et al., 2016; Jones et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2000; Purnell et al., 2011; Spetter et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2014, 2015 ) used an 'on-o treatment related block design 'to assess the direct e ect of the target compound on the brain. Nutrients are administered during the fMRI examination and the timing of hormonal plasma absorption is used to investigate the brain response. The best example is a milestone study by Liu et al. (2000) , in which the statistical model to investigate the BOLD signal is based on the increasing insulin plasma levels after glucose administration. The last paradigm used during fMRI examination was that of the classical resting state. At the highest point of plasma hor- mone absorption, an fMRI sequence is performed; the subjects had to relax and not think about anything in particular. Di erences within brain networks involved in appetite and satiety regulation were then investigated. Although these paradigms are di erent, the absence of any cogni- tive tasks makes the results rather comparable. The focus is on brain activity changes associated with variations in hormonal plasma con- centrations. 4.3. Neuroimaging results In line with subjective feelings of appetite, neuroimaging results demonstrate that the two classes of gut hormones have opposite e ects on the neural circuit of appetite. In particular, activation in frontocor- tical regions, such as OFC, ACC and insula correlates positively with ghrelin plasma levels, and with increased hunger feelings. Subcortical areas like the thalamus, hippocampus, striatum and hypothalamus correlated negatively with ghrelin levels. These results have con- sistently been reported in 8 studies ( Batterham et al., 2007; Goldstone et al., al., 2012; Kroemer et al., 2013a, 2015; Li et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2014 ,2015, p. 2 ), while 2 studies ( Leidy et al., 2013; Savage et al., 2014 ) found associations in di erent directions. This discrepancy can perhaps be explained by the use of the food-cue paradigm that could discriminate between high caloric and low caloricfood cues and therefore be more speci c. In contrast, plasma levels of satiety-stimulating hormones correlate negatively with the same cortical areas and positively with subcortical areas. The present ndings t with a model proposed by Woods ( Woods et al., 1998 ), which embeds gut-brain interactions during food-intake within the framework of homeostasis regulation. After food intake, the circulating adipose signals (ghrelin and insulin) penetrate the blood brain barrier and stimulate receptors on neurons in the hypothalamus (Woods et al., 1998 ). Satiety signals generated by ingested food enter subcortical areas, such as amygdala and striatum, where they in fluence reflexes related to the acceptance or rejection of food. In a second step, the hypothalamus sends signals to cortical areas, such as the OFC, ACC and insula, as part of the reward mechanism, where cognitive in- formation is integrated with adiposity signals. A higher cognitive eva- luation is performed and the prospective eating behaviour is de- termined. This model of integration between gut peptides, brain responses and subjective feelings explains the opposite direction of the correlations between cortical and subcortical brain activation, sub- jective satiety and appetite feelings and hormonal plasma levels. Increased activity of adiposity signals enhances the ability of satiety signals to terminate a meal or of appetite signals to continue eating. Although this pattern is clear in the majority of the included studies (De Silva et al., 2012; Douglas et al., 2015; Gautier et al., 2000; Grosshans et al., 2012; al., 2014, et al., al., al., et al., et al., 2012; Page et al., 2013; Rosenbaum et al., 2008 ;Spetter et al., 2014, p. 20 ;Tataranni et al., 1999; Wright et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2015 ), discrepancies across studies may be due to the peculiarity of the di erent satiety stimulating hormones that have intrinsic prop- erties and therefore a ect di erent brain areas in di erent ways. 4.4. Di erences between a clinical obese and a healthy lean population Finally, our last result concerns the e ects of gut peptides on brain activation in obese subjects. The included studies provide little, if any, evidence for alterations in obese compared to lean subjects. In parti- cular, the results of gut hormones on brain regional activity in the obese population is not reproduced by any study using the same amount of ingested nutrients and the same paradigm. Moreover, it is very hard to compare brain changes in obese and lean subjects due to a lack of statistical comparisons between the two groups within each study. Moreover, the discrepancies of results can be explained by metho- dological issues (the di erent nutrients administered, di erent peptides investigated and di erent paradigms used during the fMRI examina- tion) and by the low number of studies performed and the lack of re- producibility of the results. Further investigations on the di erential eectsof gut peptides on the appetite circuit between obese and lean population are therefore needed. 4.5. Limitations Arst limitation that we want to highlight is that most studies didn't control for possible pre-existing preferences for the participants for certain type of foods and this can impact the studies results. Moreover, the results might be in fluenced by psychopathological states, such as mood disturbances, which have not been systematically as- sessed in the included studies. Also the use of cannabinoids or psy- choactive substances was self-reported and consequently not necessa- rily accurate ( Becker et al., 2015 ). These factors may confound the neuroimaging results. The amount of nutrients ingested varied in several studies and this hampers comparability. Moreover, the timing of the fMRI examination was very di erent across studies. It varied from an examination im- mediately after substance intake to 6 weeks post-administration. Although (as stated above) the timing was in accordance with the aimD. Zanchi et al. 1HXURVFLHQFH\u0003DQG\u0003%LREHKDYLRUDO\u00035HYLHZV\u0003\u001b\u0013\u0003 \u0015\u0013\u0014\u001a \u0003\u0017\u0018\u001a\u00b2 \u0017\u001a\u0018 \u0017\u001a\u0016of the investigation, it cannot be denied that this may result in a con- founding factor and make the studies poorly comparable. Furthermore, in neuroimaging studies addressing brain-gut interactions in healthy subjects, the sample sizes were modest because the design of the study makes recruitment of subjects relatively di cult. Finally, we suggest that studies including randomised samples that express preferences for speci c food have to be conducted. Moreover, psychopathological states, such as mood disturbances in the partici- pants, have to be previously screened in order to avoid confounding factors that can a ect the results. Furthermore, studies on eating dis- orders, such as anorexia and bulimia, can greatly enhance the clinical relevance of studies of the e ects of speci c nutrients on brain regions regulating appetite. It would also be interesting to investigate cognitive changes (such as working memory performance) after nutrient admin- istration, as shown by pioneering studies ( Borgwardt et al., 2012; Schmidt et al., 2014 ). Finally, studies using a standardised amount of ingested nutrient should be performed, since the amount of ingested nutrients can also lead to di erences in the strength of brain activation 5. Conclusion The present article systematically reviewed the existing literature investigating how gut peptides in fluence brain regions regulating ap- petite and satiety in healthy and obese subjects. The activation of brain areas controlling the brain-gut matrix occurs in opposite directions in respect to satiety or appetite regulation. The present review can en- hance our understanding of the physiology of eating behaviour and the pathophysiology of obesity and eating disorders and is the basis for a future meta-analysis in the eld.

The current study investigates the effects of two different amino acids on the human gut-brain system, using a multimodal approach, integrating physiological and neuroimaging data. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, L-tryptophan, L-leucine, glucose and water were administered directly into the gut of 20 healthy subjects. Functional MRI (fMRI) in a resting state paradigm (RS), combined with the assessment of insulin and glucose blood concentration, was performed before and after treatment. Independent component analysis with dual regression technique was applied to RS-fMRI data. Results were corrected for multiple comparisons. In comparison to glucose and water, L-tryptophan consistently modifies the connectivity of the cingulate cortex in the default mode network, of the insula in the saliency network and of the sensory cortex in the somatosensory network. L-leucine has lesser effects on these functional networks. L-tryptophan and L-leucine also modified plasma insulin concentration. Finally, significant correlations were found between brain modifications after L-tryptophan administration and insulin plasma levels. This study shows that acute L-tryptophan and L-leucine intake directly influence the brain networks underpinning the food-reward system and appetite regulation. Luminal enteral communication is a key factor in the regulation of appetite, food intake and metabolism. Protein digestion to dipeptides or tripeptides and free amino acids modulate digestive functions, glycemia and appetite1-6. Protein is currently believed to exert the greatest appetite-suppressing e ffect of the three macronutrients (carbo - hydrates, fats and proteins) in animals and humans7. High-protein diets have been extensively studied for their ability to reduce total energy intake and body weight7. Mechanisms that have been suggested include stimulation of insulin release3, postprandial thermogenesis1, intestinal gluconeogenesis7, and direct e ffects of amino acids in regions of the brain6. In addition, it has been hypothesized that protein-induced satiation could be due to altera - tions in the release of in 1956, it was suggested that an elevated concentration of plasma amino acids serve as a satiation signal for food intake and thereby results in depressed food intake8. To date the e ffect of speci fic amino acids on satiation and appetite is only rarely studied. Amino acids, including L-leucine9,10, L-glutamine11,12, and L-phenylalanine13 modulate appetite and/or glyce - mia in lean, obese, or type 2 diabetic subjects. The aromatic amino acid, L-tryptophan, is of particular interest, as previous studies have reported e ffects on digestive functions14 Rts | 6:35727 | DOI: 10.1038/srep35727It is unknown how amino acids a ffect speci fic brain regions. A fter eating, the brain senses a biochemical change and then signals satiation, but the precise sequence of events has not been determined. Even for estab - lished physiological systems such as glucose-insulin regulation, the timing of the interaction between hormonal processes and neural events has mostly been inferred from blood sampling studies. Recently, neuroimaging stud - ies have provided in vivo information about the neuro-anatomical correlates of the regulation of energy intake. Temporal orchestration of such systems is, however, crucial to the integration of the neural and hormonal signals that control eating behaviour. In a landmark paper demonstrating eating-related neural activity in the brain, the response was shown to interact with an internal signal, plasma insulin16. As it was shown that most amino acids induce an increase in insulin (possibly due to an increase in GLP-1), amino acids could be one of the signals from the gut that interact with the brain through satiation peptides. The present study was designed to further investigate the luminal in fluences of nutrients, which orches - trate gut-brain interactions. The objective was to compare e ffects of intragastric L-tryptophan (L-Trp) and L-leucine (L-Leu) on brain networks and the release of insulin and glucose. We used plasma levels to repre - sent physiological di fferences; this is a reliable measure of appetite and satiety17,18. In particular the association between brain activity in areas involved in appetite, appetite and satiety rating scores and levels of insulin and glucose was already demonstrated in previous studies16,19. On the basis of previous studies highlighting the differences between L-Trp and L-Leu on digestive functions20, with L-leucine stimulating appetite and L-tryptophan stimulating satiety21, we hypothesized that L-Trp would induce a di fferent activation pattern in the brain, leading to modi fications in brain networks related to appetite and metabolism regulation. The selection of the doses of L-tryptophan was based on the daily intake recommended by World Health Organization (WHO)22. The doses are comparable to the amount of L-tryptophan in soybeans in a normal portion of an Asian dish. For L-leucine an isocaloric approach to L-tryptophan was chosen. Glucose was chosen as a positive control and water as a negative control as we have previously shown e ffects on brain activity with both of them23. We have never intended to do an isocaloric comparison between glucose and amino acids. Results Physiological and psychological results. Differences in insulin levels . (Figure 1A) No signi ficant dif - ferences were found between the treatments in insulin levels at baseline (Time1, before treatment). At Time2, the ANOV A was (p < 0.001) showing signi ficant di fferences in insulin plasma levels a fter the treatments administration. In particular, signi ficantly higher insulin concentrations were found a fter glucose administration than with L-tryptophan (p < 0.001), L-leucine (p < 0.001) or with placebo (p < 0.001). Signi ficantly higher insulin levels were found a fter L-tryptophan and L-leucine administration than with placebo (p < 0.001). No statistical differences were found between insulin levels a fter L-tryptophan or L-leucine administration. Cohen's e ffect size = 2.37, var(d) = 0.17, p < 0.001. Differences in glucose levels.

In particular, signi ficantly higher glucose levels were found a fter glucose than a fter L-tryptophan (p < 0.001), a fter glucose than a fter L-leucine (p < 0.001) and a fter glucose than a fter placebo (p < 0.001). No signi ficant di fferences in glucose levels were found between the other treatments. Cohen's e ffect size (d): d = 3.66, var(d) = 0.27, p < 0.001. Figure 1. Physiological results. After treatment administration, plasma hormones levels were compared though a paired t test.

At baseline (Time0), a fter permutation based non-parametric tests, no signi ficant activation was found in the three networks for any group comparison, revealing that, before medication, there were no di fferences between the subjects in functional connectivity. At Time2, a fter permutation based non-parametric tests, ANOV A showed signi ficant di fferences between the treatments within each of the three pre-selected networks (p < 0.001). Cohen's e ffect size (d) for the default mode network was: d = 1.97, var(d) = 0.15, p < 0.001. Cohen's e ffect size (d) for the sensorimotor network was: d = 2.72, var(d) = 0.23, p < 0.001. Cohen's e ffect size (d) for the saliency network was: d = 1.07, var(d) = 0.17, p < 0.001. In particular, the comparison \"L-tryptophan vs. placebo\" revealed increased connectivity in the cingulate cortex and in the precuneous within the default mode network (DMN), in the somatosensory cortex within the sensorimotor network (SMN) and in the bilateral anterior insula within the salience network (SN) (Fig. 2A). For the comparison \"L-tryptophan vs. glucose\" , group analyses showed reduced connectivity in areas over - lapping those in the \"L-tryptophan vs. placebo\" contrast. In particular, the cingulate cortex and the precuneous show higher connectivity within the DMN, the somatosensory cortex within the SMN and the le ft anterior insula within the SN (Fig. 2B). With respect to the sensorimotor network (SMN), the comparison \"glucose vs. L-leucine\" revealed signi fi- cantly higher bilateral connectivity in the sensorimotor cortex (Fig. 2C), while the comparison \"glucose vs. pla - cebo\" shows broader connectivity in areas including the precuneous (Fig. 2D). The comparison \"L-tryptophan vs. L-leucine\" revealed signi increased connectivity in the cortex within the DMN and in the SMN (Fig. 2E). No . Finally, the interaction e ffect between time and treatments revealed no signi ficant results. These results reveal that amino acid administration has extensive e ffects on the brain, by modifying the con - nectivity of speci fic functional networks. Correlations between imaging and physiological results. After L-tryptophan administration, a pos - itive correlation (p < 0.05) was found between insulin plasma levels and bilateral activity in the insula within the saliency network (Fig. 3.1). Furthermore, a fter glucose administration, positive correlations were present between plasma insulin levels and activity in the sensorimotor area (SMA) within the sensorimotor network (SMN) (Fig. 3.2). These results established a link between the role of satiety hormones and connectivity changes in the brain a fter amino acid administration. VBM Analysis of T1 Images. VBM analysis of the grey matter (GM) revealed no statistical di fferences between the visits at baseline. Discussion The current study provides novel insights into the e ffects of luminal amino acids on gut-brain interactions. The present findings suggest that intragastric L-tryptophan (L-Trp) and L-leucine (L-Leu) lead to di fferential mod - ifications in insulin and glucose plasma concentrations and in brain networks connectivity, that are related to metabolic regulation and appetite sensations. Our results from laboratory analyses indicate that di fferent amino acids a ffect speci fic satiation hormones. In particular, L-tryptophan and L-leucine lead to a signi ficant increase in insulin plasma levels when compared to water, but at the doses given they do not a ffect glucose levels. The differential e ffects of amino acids on insulin but not on glucose have been shown before in several studies11. On the other hand, and in line with previous stud - ies24, glucose is associated with both insulin and glucose plasma levels. As L-Trp and L-Leu have been proposed to be involved in food-intake and regulation of energy homeostasis25-27, our findings suggest that L-tryptophan and L-leucine are key amino acids that a ffect satiety and appetite perception. To further explore these dynamic interactions, we investigated the e ffects of these amino acids on brain functional networks that are related to the food-reward mechanism. Our additional findings are related to large-scale alterations in brain networks involved in metabolic regula - tion a fter amino acids ingestion. Our results reveal that - compared to glucose and placebo - L-tryptophan gives higher connectivity within the default mode network in the cingulate cortex and in the precuneous and within the salience network in the bilateral insula. In general, the finding that activity in brain areas regulating appetite can be in fluenced by di fferent nutrients is consistent with previous reports19,28 on modi fications a fter glucose and fructose ingestion. Our study extends this research, by focusing for the first time on amino acids ingestion and suggesting that L-tryptophan may be a key amino acid that increases brain connectivity in areas controlling the metabolic state of the individual. Moreover, the direct link between satiation hormones and brain areas involved in metabolism regulation is confirmed by the positive correlation between brain activity in the insular cortex and insulin plasma levels a fter L-tryptophan administration. These results resemble previous findings in studies with glucose intake and con - firms that there is a direct link between these regions and food-reward mechanisms16. Furthermore, in comparison to placebo and glucose, L-tryptophan administration also increases activity within the sensorimotor network in somatosensory areas. This is the first study to report large-scale modi fications in brain activity a fter L-tryptophan manipulation within the sensorimotor network. The reorganization in the sensorimotor network is also evident in the analysis of the e ffects of glucose administration compared to placebo that shows greater activation in somatosensory areas. As demonstrated in a previous study16, the somatosensory www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 4 Scientific Repo Rts DOI: 10.1038/srep35727area (SMA) integrates sensory and visceral signals associated with protein intake and is therefore one of the main brain areas involved in appetite regulation and food-reward mechanism. In our study, its function is con firmed by the positive correlation found between changes in activity in SMA and in insulin. Figure 2. Functional connectivity results. After independent component analyses (ICA), the dual regression technique was performed to investigate di fferences between the di fferent treatments in functional connectivity in the DMN, SN and SMN. ( A) The comparison \"L-tryptophan vs. placebo\" revealed increased connectivity in the cingulate cortex and in the precuneous within the default mode network (DMN), in the somatosensory cortex within the sensorimotor network (SMN) and in the bilateral anterior insula within the salience network. (B) The comparison \"L-tryptophan vs. glucose\" showed altered connectivity in areas overlapping those of the previous contrast. In particular, the cingulate cortex and the precuneous show higher connectivity within the DMN, the le ft anterior insula within the SN and the somatosensory cortex within the comparison \"glucose vs. L-leucine\" revealed signi ficantly higher connectivity in the bilateral sensorimotor cortex within the sensorimotor network. ( D) Within the same network (SMN), the comparison \"glucose vs. placebo\" reveals an increase in connectivity in additional areas, including the precuneous. ( E) The comparison \"L-tryptophan vs. L-leucine\" revealed signi increased connectivity in the cortex within the DMN and in the SMN. No signi ficant activations where found for the remaining comparisons. These results reveal that amino acids administration has an extensive in fluence on the brain, by modifying the connectivity of speci fic functional networks related to appetite perception and emotional regulation.www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 5 Scientific Repo Rts | 6:35727 | DOI: 10.1038/srep35727Apart from brain modi fications related to the food-reward system, we infer that L-tryptophan has an in fluence on cognitive functions and mood regulation. In fact, as demonstrated by di fferent studies manipulating serotonin levels, changes in the activity in prefrontal regions can a ffect cognitive control and emotion processing29-32. In particular, as suggested by Kramer33, L-tryptophan depletion is linked to reduced activity in the insula, that in turn regulates decision making in potential aggressive situations. On the other side, modulation of L-tryptophan leads to changes in the DMN that may reduce depressive mood34. Following this interpretation changes in the DMN and SN a fter L-tryptophan intake can be linked to changes in cognitive functions and emotion processing. Our last result concerns the role of L-leucine on brain networks at rest. When L-tryptophan was compared to L-leucine, no di fferences were found in the activity in the insular cortex within the SN or within the DMN in the precuneous, while signi ficant di fferences were present in the ACC within the DMN and within the SMN in the SMA. Moreover, comparison of glucose vs. L-leucine didn't find any di fferences in the DMN or SN. Even if no previous studies have been conducted on the e ffects of L-leucine at brain level, these results suggest that this amino acid has an e ffect on brain network connectivity that is not equivalent to that of water, which suggests that L-leucine may in fluence areas responsible for cognitive and metabolic processing. Further investi - gations are needed to further clarify the e ffect of this amino acid on brain networks at rest. It is important to note that this study has some limitations. As in previous neuroimaging studies of the brain-gut axis in healthy subjects, our sample size was modest because the design of the study makes recruitment of subjects relatively di fficult. On the other hand Cohen's e ffect size analyses reveal that the treatments show already high magnitude. In addition, the present study focused on only two amino acids. Further investigations should be conducted on more amino acids. Moreover, plasma levels were measured for glucose and insulin, while other hormones might have better detected physiological di fferences between the di fferent amino acids. Our results might potentially be in fluenced by mood variations not investigated by the oral examination of the health status of the participants. However, it is important to highlight that the aim of the present study is to investigate changes in brain networks involved in satiation and appetite regulation and changes in hormones levels also related to satiation and appetite (as glucose and insulin). Moreover, it is unlikely that there are systematic changes in mood associated with speci fic amino acids (the treatments were randomized), hence it is unlikely that potential mood variations systematically biased the current results. Furthermore, the fMRI examination in our study is not conditioned by a paradigm, so the results re flect pure resting state functional connectivity and they may not be comparable to other studies that use a tasks-related approach. Concerning the fMRI analyses, it is important to notice that smoothing may introduce spurious local functional connectivity and a ffect the subsequent conduction of ICA. Therefore, we performed the analyses without applying smoothing and we compared the three functional networks with and without smoothing. As expected smoothing improves the quality of the results, making the components less noisy. Therefore we decided to work on smoothed data. Lastly, T1 images were acquired at Time0 but not Time2, but the preprocessing of the Time2 images used the T1 image at Time0, so there were di fferent space templates in segment. Since the subjects stayed in the MRI during the treatments administration, the posi - tion of the subjects remained the same during all the sequences, therefore the registration can be considered quite effective. Moreover, we repeated the analyses registering the EPI images directly to standard space. Slightly worse registration was seen in the brain networks for the registration directly to MNI, as expected (in fact this is the reason why the high-resolution 3DT1 was used). Despite this small reduction in the quality of the spatial normal - ization, we observed no relevant di fferences in the brain networks identi fied by ICA between the two di fferent registrations. This shows that the registration first to T1 and then to MNI was the most e ffective one, and that the effect of the spatial registration on the results was marginal. Figure 3. Correlations between imaging and physiological results. After L-tryptophan administration, a positive correlation (p < 0.05) was found between levels of insulin and connectivity in the saliency network (A). Furthermore, a fter glucose administration, positive correlations were present between insulin levels and connectivity in the sensorimotor network (SMN) ( B). These results establish a link between the role of satiety hormones in amino acids synthesis and changes in functional connectivity in the brain.www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 6 Scientific Repo Rts | 6:35727 | DOI: 10.1038/srep35727Finally, it is important to underline possible confounding results from structural changes in grey matter that can in fluence the response to the treatment administration. To avoid this, VBM analyses were conducted before treatment administration and no di fferences were observed between the visits, thus excluding this potential confounder. Conclusion The current work provides new insights into acute neural modi fications a fter ingestion of amino acids. By link - ing satiety hormones and fMRI measurements, this study shows that acute L-tryptophan and L-leucine intake directly a ffect speci fic brain networks that underpin the food-reward system and appetite regulation. Materials and Methods Participants. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Basel, Switzerland (EKBB: 08/11) and conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines. All participants gave written informed consent prior to inclusion. Twenty-three (23) subjects were recruited through local and Internet advertising. Each participant underwent a medical interview, laboratory screening and gave written informed consent. Exclusion criteria were: lactose intolerance, smoking, substance abuse, regular intake of medications, medical or psychiatric illness, and any contraindication to MRI (e.g. claustrophobia, non-removable metal devices) or abnormalities detected upon laboratory screening. Of the 23 subjects originally recruited, three had to be excluded, as they did not meet the eligibility criteria. The final sample included 20 healthy volunteers (28.1 \u00b1 6.2 years, 11 females). Estimation of statistical power in functional MRI requires knowledge of the expected percent signal change between two con - ditions, as well as estimates of the variability in percent signal change. We calculated the sample size for a strict statistical adjusted threshold of p < 0.05, 20 subjects were required to achieve 50% power at the single voxel level for brain activations in the a priori de fined networks of interest. Experimental Protocol. This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, crossover study and was carried out at the Phase I Research Unit of the University Hospital of Basel. L-tryptophan, L-leucine, glucose and placebo were administered to each subject on four di fferent days, following the procedure described below. The treatment order was randomized and at least 7 days passed between the visits. Therefore no interaction was present between the four administrations. The subjects started each physiological and imaging examination between 9 and 10am in the morning, a fter an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. The subjects consumed no breakfast before the visits. The study was carried out in three phases: Baseline (Time0), treatment administration (Time1) treatment assessment (Time2) (Fig. 4). Before each visit health status assessment was performed orally by a physician. At the beginning of the experi - ment an 8F polyvinyl nasogastric tube was inserted into the stomach through an anesthetized nostril and its intra - gastric position was con firmed by rapid injection of 10 ml of air and auscultation of the upper abdomen. Then two blood samples were taken through a peripheral venous cannula and stored for laboratory analyses. Baseline examination (Time0) was then conducted, in order to control for possible di fferences in hormone levels and brain functions and structures before treatment administration. To assess for possible functional and structural differences at the brain level, subjects underwent an fMRI examination, including a functional resting state (RS) sequence and a T1 sequence. Before scanning a pillow in dotation of the MRI PRISMA was set in the head-coil behind the head of the subjects to prevent subjects head movements. After the fMRI examination, the treatment was administered (Time1). The solutions were freshly prepared and were at room temperature when administered. L-tryptophan and L-leucine were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Chemical Company, Germany ( > 97% pure) and glucose monohydrate was purchased from Haenseler AG (Herisau, Switzerland). Di fferent persons prepared and administered the treatment, in order to maintain the double blindness of the study. Subjects received 300 ml tap water with 1.56 g (7.5 mmol) L-tryptophan, 1.56 g (11.89 mmol) L-leucine, 75 g glucose, and 300 ml pure tap water (placebo) via a nasogastric tube, over 2 minutes while sitting in the MR room. 15 minutes a fter administration, the tube was removed. To evaluate treatment e ffects, the subjects underwent a second physiological and brain imaging examination (Time2): blood sampling assessed through a peripheral venous cannula and fMRI examination (RS sequence) was repeated. No T1 sequence was used in this phase, since structural changes were not expected, due to the short period of time a fter treatment administration. Laboratory analyses. Plasma glucose concentration was measured by a glucose oxidase method (Rothen Medizinische Laboratorien AG, Basel, Switzerland). The intra- and inter-assay coe fficients of variation are below 2.9% and below 3.9%, respectively. Plasma Insulin was measured with a commercially available electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Cobas/ Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). The intra- and inter-assay coe fficients of variation for this assay are below 2.0% and below 2.8%, respectively. fMRI acquisition. Images were obtained using a 3T scanner (Prisma; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a standard 32-channel head-coil. fMRI imaging of the whole brain was acquired by echo planar imaging, using the following parameters: whole brain coverage, TR = 1.8 s, TE = 28 ms, 35 slices, slice thickness 3.5 mm, 168 repe - titions. The 3D T1-weighted structural scan had the following parameters: 256 \u00d7 256 matrix size, 176 sections, 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm3, TE = 3.37 ms, TR = 2000 ms).www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 7 Scientific Repo Rts | 6:35727 | DOI: 10.1038/srep35727Statistical Analysis. The statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism (Version 6, GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA), FSL (Version 5.0.9, FMRIB, Oxford, UK) and R (Version 0.99.896, The R-Project for Statistical Computing). Analysis of physiological data. To compare hormones levels between the di fferent treatments at Time1 and Time2 separately, a repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOV A) was performed with Tukey post-hoc pair-wise comparisons. Cohen's e ffect size was also calculated using compute.es package in R (https://cran.r-project.org/) to assess the strength of the di fference in hormones plasma levels between the treatments. Functional connectivity analysis. Pre-processing of functional data . Processing and analysis of imaging data of Time1 and Time2 were performed using FSL. Preprocessing included brain extraction using FSL 's BET (Brain Extraction Tool), motion correction using FSL 's MCFLIRT (intra-modal motion correction tool)35, spatial smoothing of 5 mm using FSL 's SUSAN (noise reduction uses nonlinear filtering)36. High-pass temporal filtering of 100 seconds was used according to the standard MELODIC ICA procedure in FSL (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ fsl/fslwiki/MELODIC). Functional images were first co-registered to structural images (acquired during Time1) using linear transformation and later normalized to MNI space using linear transformation. In addition, for each subject, we computed a maximum of the framewise displacement37,38 from the realignment parameters and sub - jected this to group (treatments) comparison (ANOV A). RSNs and Subcortical structures identification. To de fine brain networks at rest, independent com - ponent analysis (ICA) was carried out on the resting state data of Time1 using FSL 's multi-session multivariate exploratory linear optimized decomposition into independent components (MELODIC Multi-session temporal concatenation)39. First automatic estimation of components was used to explore resting state networks, but due to high parcellation of the signal, the number of components was set to 25 as suggested by previous studies and as common practice in ICA for fMRI data40. Out of these 25 components, we decided to select and focus our analyses on 3 resting-state networks (RSNs) identi fied as consistent by previous studies41,42 and involved in appe - tite regulation and control of metabolism43: Default Mode (DMN), Sensorimotor Network (SMN) and Saliency Network (SN). RSNs group comparison and correlations with clinical scores. A dual regression approach with non - parametric permutation (5000) tests (randomize, FSL) was carried out on the resting state data at Time1 and Figure 4. Study design. After an overnight stay of at least 10 hours, the study was carried out in three phases: Baseline (Time0), treatment administration (Time1) treatment assessment (Time2). The baseline examination (Time0) was conducted to control for possible di fferences in hormone levels and brain functions and structures before treatment administration. Two blood samples were taken through a peripheral venous cannula and stored for laboratory analyses (for blood collection method refer to 38. To assess for possible functional and structural di fferences at the brain level, the subjects underwent an fMRI examination, including a functional resting state (RS) sequence and a T1 sequence. A fter the fMRI examination, the treatment was administered (Time1). An 8F polyvinyl nasogastric tube was inserted into the stomach through an anaesthetized nostril. Subjects received 300 ml tap water with 1.56 g (7.5 mmol) L-tryptophan, 75 g glucose, 1.56 g (11.89 mmol) L-leucine and 300 ml pure tap water (placebo) via the nasogastric tube over 2 minutes while sitting in the MR room. 15 minutes a fter administration, the tube was removed. To evaluate treatment e ffects, the subjects underwent a second physiological and brain imaging examination (Time2): blood sampling assessed through a peripheral venous cannula and fMRI examination (RS sequences) were repeated. No T1 sequence was used in this phase, since structural changes were not expected in the short period of time a fter treatment administration.www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 8 Scientific Repo Rts | 6:35727 Time2 to detect statistically di fferences between treatments (placebo vs. L-tryptophan, L-tryptophan vs. glucose, glucose vs. L-leucine, etc.) within the boundaries of the three RSNs identi fied at Time1. A repeated measure ANOV A was performed. Results were corrected for multiple comparisons using threshold free cluster enhancement (TFCE) and p values < 0.05 were considered as signi ficant. TFCE is similar to cluster-based thresholding, but generally more robust and avoids the need for the arbitrary initial cluster-forming threshold. It is recommended when randomize is performed44. Moreover, we performed an ANOV A comparing the visits in respect to time to test whether any interaction e ffect between times and treatments is present. Finally, Cohen's e ffect size was also calculated for each comparison within each network using compute.es package in R (https://cran.r-project.org/). Correlations between imaging and physiological results. Additionally, we tested for possible correla - tions between regions that were signi ficantly active in the previous contrasts and hormones levels. On the basis of the results of the dual regression, we de fined regional masks and extracted region-averaged time courses of each subject for the three resting state networks. These values were then correlated with the insu - lin and glucose levels of each subject, using Pearson correlations. VBM Analysis of T1 Images. To assess di fferences in grey matter density between groups, a voxel-based morphometric (VBM) analysis was performed in FSL (FSL Version 5.0.9; http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk), using stand - ard processing steps45,46. Firstly, BET extraction and tissue-type segmentation were performed using the cor - responding FSL tools (Brain Extraction Tool and FAST4). Secondly, non-linear transformation into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) reference space was applied and a study-speci fic grey matter (GM) template was cre - ated. The native GM images were then non-linearly registered to this template. Finally, the images were smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel of 2 mm sigma. A voxel-wise GLM was implemented using permutation-based nonparametric testing (Randomise, part of FSL). Results were corrected for multiple comparisons using TFCE44 and p values < 0.05 were considered as signi ficant. References 1. Batterham, R. L. et al.

Front.

Five minutes after glucose, fructose, or placebo administration through a nasogastric tube, 12 participants underwent 3 complementary neuroimaging techniques: 2 task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sequences to assess working memory (N-back) and response inhibition (Go/No-Go) and one resting state fMRI sequence to address the cognition-related fronto-parietal network (FPN) and salience network (SN). During working memory processing, glucose intake decreased activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) relative to placebo, while fructose decreased activation in the ACC and sensory cortex relative to placebo and glucose. During response inhibition, glucose and fructose decreased activation in the ACC, insula and visual cortex relative to placebo. Resting state fMRI indicated increased global connectivity strength of the FPN and the SN during glucose and fructose intake. The results demonstrate that glucose and fructose lead to partially different partially overlapping changes in regional brain activities that underpin cognitive performance in different tasks. Keywords: functional magnetic resonance imaging, glucose, fructose, brain-gut, working memory, cognition inTr ODU c T i O n The mammalian brain depends upon sugars as the main source of energy, and the regulation of sugar metabolism is critical for brain physiology ( 1 ). Glucose and fructose, two of the most important monosaccharides, have a roughly equal number of calories but are metabolized differently ( 2 ). Glucose, a highly potent secretagogue, leads to the release of insulin and satiation hormones such as GLP-1 by enteroendocrine cells as well as inhibition of the appetite inducer ghrelin ( 3 , 4 ). In contrast, fructose intake does not affect the release of insulin to the same extent ( 5 , 6 ) and chronic fructose consumption may adversely affect human health by leading to increased de novo lipogenesis in the liver, hyperuricemia, and obesity ( 7 , 8 ).2Zanchi et al. Functional Changes after Sugar Administration Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 71 The differences in the metabolism of glucose and fructose may also explain their differential effects on neuronal pathways. Page's milestone study (9) has documented reduced relative cerebral blood flow and increased functional connectivity after the inges-tion of sugars (both glucose and fructose) in the insula, cingulate, striatum, and posterior (appetite and food-reward regions). The effects from fructose were greater, and this resulted in increased brain activation in the visual cortex during a food-cue task (2). Similar results were found by a recent study conducted by our group investigating resting state func- tional connectivity in the basal ganglia network (4). Whereas changes linked to appetite stimulation in the human brain are generally accepted (2, 9, 10), recent animal studies sug- gest that sugars may have different effects on brain regional activ- ity underlying cognitive functioning (11-14). While extensive evidence indicates that increased glucose concentrations enhance learning and memory processes in rodents through the enhance-ment of hippocampal activity (15), recent studies indicate that the hippocampus may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of fructose, with impaired synaptic plasticity and consequent decreased working memory performance after high-fructose diets (16, 17). To our knowledge, no previous studies have inves- tigated the effects of glucose and fructose on whole-brain activity during different cognitive functions in humans. Therefore, while dietary energy intake, in particular the con- sumption of simple sugars such as fructose, has been increasing steadily in Western societies, the effects of such a diet on the human brain are still poorly understood (17). In particular, food intake (as sugars) can have a significant role beside age and gen-der in multimodal neuroimaging studies (18). The present study can be considered as a starting point for future investigations also outside the brain-gut field, suggesting to assess nutrients intake in the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analyses. In the present study, we employ a functional multimodal approach to study the effects of glucose and fructose on differ - ent cognitive functions. We administered glucose and fructose to the participants through a nasogastric tube inserted into the stomach. After 5 min, the participants underwent an extensive fMRI examination, performing one N-back task (to assess work- ing memory), one Go/No-go task (to assess response inhibition), and one resting state sequence focusing on two cognition-related resting state networks, in particular the fronto-parietal network (FPN) and salience network (SN). As glucose and fructose are subject to differential metabolic processes at the cellular level (2), we hypothesized that these monosaccharides would also induce dissociable effects on brain regional activity during cognitive functioning. MaTerials anD MeThODs Participants The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Basel, Switzerland (EKBB: 08/11) and conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines. The participants and the experiment protocol for the present study were already presented in a previous work of the same team ( 4). Fourteen (14) subjects were recruited through local and internet advertising. Each participant underwent a medical interview and laboratory screening and gave written informed consent prior to inclusion. Exclusion criteria were: lactose intolerance, smoking, substance abuse, regular intake of medications, medical or psychiatric illness, and any contraindica-tion to MRI (e.g., claustrophobia, non-removable metal devices) or abnormalities detected upon laboratory screening. Of the 14 (14) subjects originally recruited, 2 had to be excluded as they did not meet the eligibility criteria. There was also one drop-out, who was replaced. The final sample included 12 healthy volun-teers (mean age: 24.8 years, range: 21-31 22.9 kg/m 2, kg/m2). experimental Protocol This was a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study and was carried out at the Phase I Research Unit of the University Hospital of Basel. Glucose, fructose, and a placebo were administered to each subject on three different days, following the procedure described below. The treatment order was randomized and at least 7 days passed between the visits. After an overnight fast of at least 10 h, an 8 F polyvinyl nasogastric tube was inserted into the subjects' stomach through an anesthetized nostril and its intragastric position was verified by rapid injection of 10 ml air and auscultation of the upper abdomen. The solutions were freshly prepared and were at room tem- perature when administered. Glucose monohydrate and fructose were purchased from H\u00e4nseler AG (Herisau, Switzerland). Different persons prepared and administered the solutions. Over 2 min, subjects received 300 ml of tap water with 75 g of glucose or with 25 g of fructose, or 300 ml pure tap water (placebo) via the nasogastric tube while sitting in the MR room. The administered doses were chosen on the basis of previous studies demonstrating lipogenesis increased in proportion after sugar intake (19). Directly after administration, the tube was removed. To evaluate the treatment effect, the subjects underwent a brain imaging examination, including: three echo planar imaging (EPI) sequences (N-back task, Go/No-go task, and resting state sequence) and one T 1 sequence. fMri acquisition Scanning was performed on a 3T scanner (Siemens Magnetom Verio). The N-back task sequence was performed using an EPI sequence (TR = 2,500 ms, TE = 28 ms, flip angle = 83\u00b0, field of view = 228 mm \u00d7 228 mm, 32 slices, slice thickness: 3 mm; voxel size = 3.6 mm \u00d7 3.6 mm \u00d7 3.3 mm). In total, 126 EPI volumes were acquired. The Go/No-Go task sequence was performed using an EPI sequence (TR = 2,500 ms, TE = 28 ms, flip angle = 83\u00b0, field of view = 228 mm \u00d7 228 mm, 32 slices, slice thickness: 3 mm; voxel size = 3.6 mm \u00d7 3.6 mm \u00d7 3.3 mm). In total, 160 EPI volumes were acquired. The resting state EPI sequence had the following parameters: TR = 2,000 ms, TE = 28 ms, flip angle = 82\u00b0, field of view = 228 mm \u00d7 228 mm, 32 slices, slice thickness: 3.3 mm; voxel size = 3.6 mm \u00d7 3.6 mm \u00d7 3.3 mm. In total, 152 EPI vol- umes were acquired. Finally, the 3D T 1-weighted structural scan 3 Zanchi et al. Functional Changes after Sugar Administration Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 71had the following parameters: 256 \u00d7 256 matrix size, 176 sections, 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm TE = 3.37 ms, TR = 2,000 ms. n-Back Task During the N-back task (20- 22), all participants saw series of letters with an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 2 s. Each stimu- lus was shown for 1 s. During a baseline (0-back) condition, participants were required to press the button with the right hand when the letter \"X\" appeared. During 1-back and 2-back conditions, participants were instructed to press the button if the currently presented letter was the same as that presented in one (1-back condition) or two trials previously (2-back condition). The three conditions were presented in 10 alternating 30-s blocks (2 \u00d7 1-back, 3 \u00d7 2-back, and 5 \u00d7 0-back), matched for the num- ber of target letters per block (i.e., 2 or 3), in a pseudorandom order. Task performance was expressed by the accuracy (number of correct responses to the 2-back task). A repeated measure of analysis of variance (ANOV A) was performed across the three visits. go/no-go Task After the N-back task, all patients immediately underwent an event-related Go/No-Go fMRI paradigm that was conducted with jittered ISIs and containing infrequently presented oddball stimuli to optimize statistical efficiency. This is a well-validated paradigm (23, 24), requiring either the execution or the inhibi- tion of a motor response, depending on the visual presentation of the stimuli. The basic Go task is a choice reaction time paradigm, in which arrows point either to the left or to the right for 500 ms, with a mean ISI of 1,800 ms (jitter range: 1,600-2,000 ms). During Go trials, subjects were instructed to press the left or the right response button according to the direction of the arrow. In 11% of the trials, arrows pointing upward appeared. During these so-called \"No-Go\" trials, participants were required to inhibit their motor response. During another 11% of the trials, arrows point- ing left or right at a 23\u00b0 angle were shown, and the subjects were told to respond in the same way as to Go stimuli (even though they pointed obliquely). These \"oddball\" stimuli were used as a control of the novelty effects associated with the low frequency and different orientation of the No-Go relative to the Go trials (stimulus-driven attention allocation). In total, there were 24 No-Go, 160 Go, and 24 oddball trials, with task durations of approximately 6 min. statistical analysis software The statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism (Version 6, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) and FSL (Version 5.0.9, FMRIB, Oxford, UK). analysis of cognitive Performance N-Back Task To compare the performance during the N-back task, the reac- tion time and the number of correct answers (accuracy) were investigated for all conditions. A repeated measure ANOV A was performed with Tukey correction for post hoc pair-wise comparisons.Go/No-Go Task To compare the performance during the Go/No-go task, the reaction time and the \"probability of inhibition\" (ratio between No-Go correct and incorrect response) were investigated for all conditions. A repeated measure ANOV A was performed with Tukey correction for post hoc pair-wise comparisons. Task-Based Functional imaging analyses Pre-Processing Processing and analysis of imaging data were performed using FSL FEAT (fMRI Expert Analysis Tool version 6.00, http://fsl. fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FEAT). Pre-processing included brain extraction using FSL 's brain extraction tool, motion correction using FSL 's MCFLIRT (intra-modal motion correction tool) (25) and smoothing using FSL 's SUSAN (noise reduction uses non- linear filtering) (26). Images were finally normalized to MNI space. N-Back Task After pre-processing, the linear-model analysis of the N-back sequence included two levels. At the first level, the contrast \"2-back vs. 0-back\" was calculated separately for each participant. At the second level, group differences between glucose, fructose, and placebo were investigated. This resulted in a mixed-effects group model implementing FLAME 1 (FMRIB's Local Analysis of Mixed Effects). Finally, a repeated measures permutation- based non-parametric test (randomize, FSL tool) was applied, correcting for multiple comparisons by threshold-free cluster enhancement (27). p-Values <0.05 were considered as significant. Go/No-Go Task After pre-processing, general linear models (GLM) analysis were performed to investigate brain activation differences during the Go/No-go sequence. At the first level, the contrast \"No-go vs. oddball\" was calculated separately for each participant. At the second level, group differences between glucose, fructose, and placebo were investigated. As above, a repeated measures permutation-based non-parametric approach (randomized, FSL tool) was applied, correcting for multiple comparisons by threshold-free cluster enhancement (27). p-Values <0.05 were considered as significant. Functional resting state connectivity analysis Resting State Network Identification After pre-processing, to define brain networks at rest, an independent component analysis (ICA) was carried out on the resting state data using FSL 's multi-session multivariate explora- tory linear optimized partition into independent components (MELODIC multi-session temporal concatenation) (28), setting the number of components to 20, which is common practice in ICA for fMRI data. Out of these 20 components, we decided to select and focus our analyses on 2 resting state networks (RSN): the fronto-parietal (also called executive functions) (FPN) network and the SN\u2014identified as consistent with our previous studies (29, 30)\u2014due to their involvement in cognitive functions TaBle analyses, we carried out cross-modalities correlations analyses. Significant correlations were found between the N-back results and resting state connectivity strength, both for the FPN (p < 0.05) and salience network (SN) (p < 0.05). For the SN, significant correlations were found between the Go/No-go results and the resting state connectivity values (p < 0.05). The results are corrected for FDR multiple comparison corrections.

Cross-correlation of the two time- series, timepoint by timepoint, using as reference RS maps of Laird (30) were performed to compare the EF and SN networks to a major RSN template using a higher number of subjects. RSNs Group Comparison A dual regression approach (34) was carried out on the resting state data within the boundaries of the identified RSN. Region- averaged time courses of each subject for the three resting state networks were extracted and submitted to a repeated measure ANOV A to test for differences between the treatments, using Tukey correction for post hoc pair-wise comparisons. cross-Modalities correlations After the task-based and resting state studies, we performed cross-modalities correlations analyses. The regional averaged time-course was extracted across the subjects for the N-back and the Go/No-go for the significant contrasts. Moreover, connectivity values from the identified component for the resting state analyses were used. Individual correlation analyses across modalities were performed. FDR multiple comparisons corrections were used (Table 1). resUl Ts Behavioral results N-Back Task The ANOV A showed no significant differences in accuracy across treatments.

Relative to placebo, fructose significantly reduced activation in the ACC/dorsal pre-frontal cortex, sensory cor - tex, and cerebellum (Figure 1B; Table S1B in Supplementary Material). Glucose compared with fructose also significantly increased activation in the bilateral dorsal pre-frontal cortex and cerebellum (Figure 1C; Table S1C in Supplementary Material). go/no-go activations Absolute values for motion \u00b1 0.06, fructose 0.21 \u00b1 0.07, placebo 0.17 \u00b1 0.07.

Relative to placebo, glucose significantly reduced activation in the ACC, dorsal pre-frontal cortex, right insula, and visual cortex (Figure 2A; Table S2A in Supplementary Material). Relative to placebo, fructose significantly reduced activation in the ACC, dorsal pre-frontal cortex, sensory cortex, and visual cortex (Figure 2B; Table S2B in Supplementary Material). No significant differences were found between glucose and fructose.

Group analyses of frame wise displacement found no significant effect of motion between the visits. Cross value correlations are for the EF network: r = 0.3, p < 0.01 and for the SN r = 0.4, p < 0.01. Repeated measure ANOV A revealed a significant main effect in functional connectivity in the fronto-parietal network (FPN) network [F (2, 11) = 13.69, p < 0.001] (Figure 3A). Subsequent post hoc testing showed significantly higher connectivity strength after ingesting glucose than with placebo (p < 0.05) or fructose (p < 0.05), while an increase in connectivity in the FPN network was found after fructose inges-tion compared with placebo (p < 0.01). Moreover, repeated measure ANOV A also revealed a significant main effect of treatment in functional connectivity in the SN network [F (2, 11) = 6.117, p < 0.05] (Figure 3B). In particular, significantly higher connectivity strength than with placebo was found after ingesting glucose (p < 0.05) or fructose (p < 0.05). No differ - ences in connectivity were found between glucose and fructose ingestion. cross-Modalities correlations results Significant correlations were found between the N-back results (p < 0.05) and resting state connectivity values, both for FPN (p < 0.05) and SN (p < 0.05). For the SN, significant correlations were found (p < 0.05) between the Go/-No-Go results and the resting state connectivity values. The results are corrected for false discovery rate multiple comparison corrections. Results are displayed in Table 1.FigUre 1 | N-back functional imaging results.

Functional Changes after Sugar Administration Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 71DiscUssiOn The present study performs an extensive assessment of cognition- related brain functional changes after glucose and fructose administration. Although we found no significant differences in behavioral performance during working memory processing and response inhibition, both glucose and fructose decreased activation in frontal areas such as the ACC and dorso-lateral pre-frontal cortex (DLPFC) during working memory processing and response inhibition\u2014especially after fructose intake. The connectivity of these regions as parts of the FPN and SN is in turn increased during glucose and fructose ingestion. Our first group of results relate to the absence of differences in task performance during working memory processing and response inhibition after glucose and fructose intake compared with placebo. The absence of changes in performance after fructose intake is confirmed by animal studies that found no differences in cognitive/motor performance as measured by object recognition FigUre 2 | Go/No-go functional imaging results. In the task-related general linear models, we considered the contrast of \"No-go versus Oddball.\" The comparison \"glucose vs. placebo\" revealed significantly reduced activations after ingesting glucose, particularly in the anterior cingulate cortex the dorsal pre-frontal cortex, right cortex (a).

Functional Changes after Sugar Administration Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 71 and fear conditioning in rodents (35, 36) and by a recent review (11) that concluded that fructose does not induce cognitive deficits. Published reports on behavioral differences after glucose administration are inconsistent with respect. Although a previ-ous study (37, 38) reported improvements in object recognition and word-recall performance after glucose intake, other authors have found no differences in cognitive performance (39-41). In the present study, we confirm the absence of changes at the behavioral level after sugar administration. From our perspec-tive, this is still an open field of research and our results with this small sample size are not definitive. Although fMRI data on small subject numbers are relatively robust (42), behavioral indexes are typically underpowered and could be confounded by many personal attributes that cannot be clearly assigned to the cognition required for adequate task performance (43). Our second group of results relate to changes at the level of brain function. During working memory processing, decreased activation in the ACC and DPFC was shown after glucose admin- istration. Less activation in the ACC/DPFC and in the sensory cortex was found after fructose administration than after glucose administration. As previous studies on cognitive functions and induced-train- ing suggested, decreased brain activation during a demanding cognitive load is associated with more efforts to perform a task (44-47). According to this interpretation, our results suggest the subjects show less demanding brain activation during the stimulus-response association task after glucose and fructose intake than with placebo (48, 49). Moreover, our findings are in line with a recent study that concluded that after glucose and fructose intake the participants showed significantly decreased cerebro-spinal fluid relative to placebo, particularly in the ACC, insula, and thalamus compared with Ref. (9). In comparison with placebo, we found reduced functional activation in the ACC, DPFC, insula, DLPFC, and visual cortex after glucose and fructose administration. No differences between glucose and fructose were found, which was comparable with the results during working memory processing. Although working memory involves temporary storage and manipulation of the information (50) and response inhibition involves the suppression of actions that are no longer required or inappropriate ( 51), our results indicate that acute glucose and fructose administration similarly modulates brain activation dur - ing these two cognitive processes. Our third group of findings relates to differences in resting state functional connectivity after fructose and glucose intake. The connectivity within the FPN and the SN is increased during FigUre 3 | Independent component analyses results. After dual regression on the executive functions network (EF) and extracting the connectivity strength values, repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed significant activation in the EC network for the three groups (a). In particular, significantly higher connectivity strength was found after ingesting glucose than with placebo (p < 0.01) and fructose (p < 0.01), while an increase in connectivity was found in the EC network after fructose ingestion (p < 0.05) compared with placebo. Moreover, repeated measure ANOVA revealed significant differences in functional connectivity in the salience network too for the three groups (B). In particular, significantly higher connectivity strength was found after ingesting glucose than with placebo (p < 0.05) and fructose compared with placebo (p < 0.05). No differences in connectivity were found between glucose and fructose ingestion. Mean and standard errors are reported. Significant levels are reported using the conventional*. Z-stat values are shown in the color bar. The results are given by repeated measures permutation-based non-parametric test (randomize, FSL tool) approach, correcting for multiple comparisons by threshold-free cluster enhancement (27). p-Values <0.05 were considered as significant, **p < 0.01. 7 Zanchi et al. Functional Changes after Sugar Administration Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 71both fructose and glucose intake compared with placebo; this is comparable with the task-induced fMRI findings, but in the opposite direction. The increase in connectivity after glucose intake has already been reported several times (4, 9, 52, 53), but ours is the first study to demonstrate increased functional connectivity in networks related to cognitive functions after fructose intake. Our correlation analyses confirm that glucose and fructose intake lead to increased functional connectivity in the FPN and SN and to decreased efforts during working memory and response inhibition tasks. We finally want to mention, as already suggested in Section \"Introduction, \" that food intake may play a significant role beside age and gender in multimodal neuroimaging studies (18). The present work can be considered as a starting point for future investigations also outside the brain-gut field, suggesting to assess nutrient intake beside age, and gender changes on brain functional activity, using them for instance as covariates in the fMRI analyses.limitations Some limitations of our study merit comment. As in previous neuroimaging studies of the brain-gut axis in healthy subjects, our sample size was modest since it is intended to be a pilot study. In addition, the present study focused only on glucose and fructose, while sucrose and other substances could also be investigated. Our results might potentially be influenced by external factors such as daily mood variations not investigated by examination of the health status of the participants. However, it is important to point out/emphasize that the aim of the present study was to investigate changes in brain networks involved in cognitive functions and this was why emotional changes were not studied in detail. In the fMRI analyses, it is important to notice that smoothing may introduce spurious local functional connectivity and affect the subsequent conduction of ICA, but we decided to keep the smoothing in order to reduce noise. We also want to stress that while we randomized for the treatment assignment order, and for the sequence of stimuli during the tasks, we did not randomize for the fMRI sequences ordering. We therefore 8Zanchi et al. Functional Changes after Sugar Administration Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 71 suggest future investigations to randomize also for the fMRI tasks ordering, to control for ordering effects. To conclude, the results of the present work suggest the pres- ence of two partially overlapping neural pathways related to cog-nitive functions after glucose and fructose ingestion. The working memory and the response inhibition pathways showed that glu- cose and fructose decrease activation and increase connectivity strengths in regions in the FPN and the SN. These results are to be considered as part of a preliminary and exploratory investigation of sugar effects on cognitive functions. Our findings suggest that future studies on diet-induced manipulations are plausible and efficient for pathologies affecting the cognitive dimension.

First, through a systematic review of the literature, previous studies assessing the effects of nutrients on brain functions were examined. A global picture on the relationship between the brain and the gut is therefore available and a common research methodology can be identified. Second, we performed a set of studies investigating the effects of sugars and amino acids on satiety hormones and RS functional networks involved in appetite regulation. Third, we investigated more specifically the effects of sugars beyond appetite and satiety, focusing on cognitive functions and discriminating their effects on working memory and response inhibition. These three studies therefore provide us with a general overview of the different processes occurring in the brain-gut interaction. The brain-gut matrix: a systematic review. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review on the effects of gut peptides on brain functions in healthy and obese subjects. 349 studies were investigated and 40 were retrieved. 52 Due to the exploratory nature of the present review, it is important to highlight differences in the methodology between the studies. A first distinction is the gut-peptides stimulation. Half of the studies used a direct administration of the target substance, as insulin, and the other half an indirect administration of a nutrient, as chocolate milkshake, that indirectly stimulated gut peptides. This choice impacts as well the aim of the investigations, the first is specifically useful for the direct assessment of gut peptides effects on brain functions and the second for assessment of the nutrients effects on gut peptides (Malik et al, 2008). Moreover, differences in substance intake can also influence the procedure of data acquisition increasing the easiness for the participants (Zanchi et al, 2016), they can also lead to changes in the timing of nutrient absorption that can influence the fMRI paradigm (De Silva et al, 2012; Liu et al, 2000a; Malik et al, 2008). While the majority of the studies used a \"food-cue paradigm\", presenting high and low caloric food cues, few used what we called an 'on-off treatment related block design' by the timing of hormonal plasma absorption to investigate the brain response. Finally, a classical resting state paradigm was used for the remained works (Zanchi et al, 2017). Regarding neuroimaging results, ghrelin plasma concentration is positively associated with activity in areas part of the food-reward system as the Pre-frontal Cortex (PFC), amygdala and insula and negatively with activity in subcortical 53 areas as the hypothalamus. In contrast, satiety-regulating gut hormones or nutrients like glucose, insulin, letpin and GLP-1 affect the same brain regions in the opposite directions (Zanchi et al, 2017). The results we found reflect the model proposed by Woods, showing activation in frontal regions as the Orbito-Frontal Cortex (OFC), Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) and insula associated positively to ghrelin plasma levels and with increased hunger feelings. Subcortical areas like the thalamus, hippocampus, striatum and hypothalamus correlated negatively with ghrelin levels (Woods et al, 1998). As Woods stated, adipose signals (ghrelin and insulin) penetrate the blood brain barrier and stimulate receptors on neurons in the hypothalamus, amygdala and striatum (Woods et al, 1998) after food intake where they influence reflexes related to the acceptance or rejection of food. Afterwards, the hypothalamus signals cortical areas part of the reward mechanism as the OFC, ACC and insula, where higher cognitive process begins. At this point the eating behaviour is determined (Higgs et al, 2017). Effects of sugars and amino acids intake on brain resting state functional connectivity. Our first study aims at investigating the effects of sugars and amino acids on brain resting state networks related to satiety regulation. In particular, we chose three resting state functional networks involved in food-reward mechanisms: the 54 Default Mode Network (DMN), the Sensorimotor Network (SMN) and the Salience Network(SN) (De Silva et al, 2012). Our results reveal that sugars and amino acids intake show differential effects on RS functional connectivity. Specifically, tryptophan shows the highest increase in connectivity within the sensory-motor network in the somatosensory area, within the default mode network in the cingulate cortex and in the precuneus and within the salience network in the bilateral insula, when compared to placebo and glucose (Zanchi et al, 2016). The reorganization in the sensorimotor network is also present after glucose administration compared to placebo. The somatosensory area (SMA) is one of the main brain areas involved in appetite regulation, integrating sensory and visceral signals associated with protein intake (Liu et al, 2000a; Park et al, 2016, 2016). This is confirmed in our study by the positive correlation found between changes in activity in SMA and in insulin. Moreover, due to changes in the DMN and SN connectivity, we speculate that tryptophan and glucose also impact brain areas involved in a broad class of functions, beyond satiety regulation. In particular, several works confirm the involvement of the DMN in mood regulation (Sheline et al, 2009; Shi et al, 2015; Uchida et al, 2015) and of the SN in cognitive functions (Cao et al, 2016; Menon and Uddin, 2010; Putcha et al, 2016). Manipulation of serotonin levels associated to tryptophan intake leads to changes in the activity in prefrontal regions that in turn can affect cognitive control and emotion processing (Dantzer et al, 2011; Passamonti et al, 2012; Seymour et al, 2012; Williams et al, 2007). Tryptophan 55 depletion is also associated with decision making processes and depressive mood (Kr\u00e4mer et al, 2011; Kunisato et al, 2011). We finally want to highlight the role of L-leucine on brain network activity at rest. The comparison L-leucine vs. Placebo shows no significant differences. However, the visual differences between tryptophan and L-leucine when compared to water suggest that the effect of L-leucine on functional activity is not equivalent to the one of water. We believe that the absence of significant results is due to the modest sample size that decreases the statistical power. However, we can only speculate and we are not allowed to go further with our interpretation. Further investigations are needed to clarify the effect of this amino acid on brain networks at rest. Effects of sugars intake on brain activity underpinning cognitive functions. Our second study explores brain activity changes related to sugars administration beyond the food-reward mechanisms, investigating the impact of glucose and fructose on cognitive functions. In particular working memory, assessed by the N-back task, is a cognitive function involved in temporary storage and manipulation of the information necessary for complex cognitive tasks (Baddeley, 1992; Jacola et al, 2014; Owen et al, 2005).Response inhibition, assessed using Go/no-go task, is involved in the suppression of no- 56 longer required or inappropriate actions, which supports flexible and goal-directed behaviors (Simmonds et al, 2008; Verbruggen and Logan, 2008). Our first results show no differences in task performance during N-back and Go/no-go task tasks after glucose and fructose intake when compared to placebo. Although our results are confirmed by several previous studies (Beilharz et al, 2015), we believe that the small sample size does not allow an extensive investigation of the behavioral performance (Wilkinson and Halligan, 2004). Further studies with a bigger sample size are suggested to depict differences in performance also in light of our functional results. In fact, as several studies showed, the BOLD signal is more sensitive to tasks than the behavior (Balsters et al, 2013; Bonakdarpour et al, 2015). Our second results related to decreased activation in frontal areas, as the ACC and dorso-lateral pre-frontal cortex (DLPFC), during working memory processing and response inhibition after both glucose and fructose ingestion compared to placebo. The connectivity of these regions as parts of the Fronto-Parietal Network (FPN) and Saliency Network (SN) is in turn increased during glucose and fructose ingestion. As stated above, studies on cognitive functions and induced-training suggested decreased brain activation during a cognitive task is associated with more efforts to perform a task, while increased activation is associated with higher easiness to perform the task (Engstr\u00f6m et al, 2013; Erickson et al, 2007; Heinzel et al, 2016; Lee et al, 2012). Following this interpretation, glucose and fructose administration 57 when compared to placebo facilitate the stimulus-response association and in turn lead to decreased activation in brain areas related to cognitive functions (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002; Erickson et al, 2005). Our correlation analyses confirm that glucose and fructose intake lead to increased functional connectivity in the FPN and SN and to decreased efforts during working memory and response inhibition tasks. 58 Limitations and further directions. Due to the exploratory nature of the present work, it is important to highlight the limitations of the investigated studies and suggest possible improvements for future works on the brain-gut interaction. First, we suggest to decrease the variability of the administered substances. Although it can appear as counterintuitive, this will decrease the complexity of the studies (less nutrients ingested will lead to a precise discrimination of their direct and indirect effects on gut peptides) promoting an univocal methodology in terms of nutrients intake and timing of administration (Sizonenko et al, 2013). This will also impact the easiness of the recruitment procedure increasing the sample size and therefore the statistical power, allowing to disentangle more consistent results in particular at the behavioral level. Decreasing the complexity of the studies and increasing the sample size is a straightforward improvement for the next generation of studies on the brain-gut interaction (Charan and Biswas, 2013). A third important improvement is the different paradigms and imaging analyses involved. Due to the exploratory nature, different paradigms were used. A validation of more specific instruments will disentangle more specifically the effects of nutrients administration on brain functions (Francis and Eldeghaidy, 2015; Isaacs, 2013; Sizonenko et al, 2013). This point is also connected to the statistical analyses used to analyze brain data. A work on the methodology of fMRI analyses where changes to the classical General Linear Model (GLM) model are explored is essential. In 59 particular, using as regressors the \"area under the curve\" of plasma concentration of gut hormones will model the statistical analyses accordingly to pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics effects. The milestone study of Liu demonstrated already this possibility (Liu et al, 2000a). A further improvement would be the investigation of the impacts of the nutrients on brain activity beyond satiety regulation and cognitive functions, such as mood and emotional feelings, as previously suggested (Benton and Donohoe, 1999; Casper, 2004). As we demonstrated after sugars intake, nutrients can also impact large scale of neural functions. This is may also be related to the effects of release of gut hormones that are associated with pathological conditions, as suggested by previous studies this may be of particular interest in psychiatry, due to the alteration of neural functions as mood and reward mechanisms, involved in depression and anxiety (Jacka, 2017; Lakhan and Kirchgessner, 2013). Moving towards this speculation, the idea that a diet can lead to improvements to normalize psychiatric condition acting on specific brain areas is a further direction to be explored. 60 REFERENCES Adan A, Serra-Grabulosa JM (2010).
