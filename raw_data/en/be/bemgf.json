I have been interested in seeing a naturopathic doctor for years, but never did because it's pricy and I was also nervous about feeling overwhelmed with the number of things they may recommend that I need (I've had that in the past with similar practices). Dr. Talei is kind, flexible, and didn't over-recommend things / tests based on my concerns. She suggested starting with 2 common tests, and she was super thorough in our follow up and really helped ease my concerns while also discussing the potential root causes of what was showing up. Looking forward to continuing to work with her :) - 5/28/2021 Dr.Jasmine Talei is an easy 5 star review! She took the time to listen carefully, and conduct multiple tests (including comprehensive hormone and food sensitivity testing) before creating my personalized treatment plan. She is kind, humble and extremely knowledgeable. Forever grateful. Thank you Dr.Talei - 8/23/2021 You will immediately feel you are in great hands with Dr. Jasmine Talei. She is one of the most caring, thorough and intuitive physicians I have worked with. I was in need for a weight loss boost and came in weekly to see her for a combination of amino acids, vitamins. MIC, l carnitine, and B12. My energy level and mood changed immediately. I would not hesitate to recommend her to anyone I know! - 10/7/2020First to Review I have been struggling with gut issues for years and have tried every natural and over the counter treatments that exist. While some have worked temporarily I always had that fear that they could come back unexpectedly. I met with Dr. Jasmin T and she did a full spectrum analysis of internal health. She found the roots of what were causing my discomfort and treated me accordingly. What a difference I feel today!! Thank you so much - 1/17/2022 Doctor Talei is excellent at what she does. She is caring and straightforward and makes recommendations that are logical and helpful. She is super knowledgeable about her field and I absolutely trust her with my care. She's always shown true empathy and dedication in all her work. I've trusted her with my family members also. Thank you Doctor T! - 11/29/2021 Dr. Talei was the only doctor I saw that was able to give me some sort of hope that I could heal. I had started experiencing gut problems, hair loss, skin issues (scalp psoriasis) and other unanswered health issues. She helped me get to the root of my problems by helping me heal from the inside out. I have decided to enroll myself in an Integrative Health Coaching program because of the breakthrough she was able to have with me and my issues. Being a health coach myself, I can't wait to share what I have learned and continue to learn along the way with my clients. She was the only doctor I saw who got me on the right track, and I recommend her to everyone! - 10/30/2020 I've consulted with Dr. Talei on a couple of occasions for various issues that I've been having recently. What I like the most about her practice is that she is focused on trying to diagnose the root cause of the issue rather than the symptoms. Moreover, she is an excellent listener and has great bedside manner - which I think is very important for any practitioner . Her suggestions and remedies have helped me a lot, especially as it relates to my issues with digestion. I would recommend her. - 11/6/2020 Dr. Talei is amazing! I recently saw her after having an operation done and she made adjusting back to \"normal\" life incredibly easy. She checked in on me daily and made sure I had all the right foods and supplements for optimal healing. She is also very easy to talk to, super knowledgeable, and has a way of making complex solutions understandable to the average person. I can trust and confide in her judgment because I can tell she truly wants what is best for me. She is also the first naturopath I have worked with who hasn't tried pushing a million products onto me. I am so grateful for her and can't recommend her enough! - 11/30/2020 Dr. Talei was the light at the end of the tunnel for my health journey. We met on a zoom call that changed my life for the better, when we spoke I was having many health issues that no doctor seemed to have an answer for. Dr talei knew exactly what blood tests to run on me and ended up saving my life. I figured out what was wrong with my health and now I can take the correct steps to live a long healthy life. Again thank you so much Dr Talei.
