Some of the earlier texts date back from the Han Dynasty (206 BCE to 220 ACE). In the western world, it is commonly known as acupuncture. However, acupuncture is only one of several modalities that physicians of TCM use to treat patients. TCM emphasizes the role of the body in the healing process and uses herbs and natural agents to maintain health. It is an effective form of treatment and a particularly safe form of therapy. TCM is a complete medical system that takes into account every aspect of human life to promote health and well-being. It sees the body as one whole entity like a \"Garden\" and encompasses its physical, emotional, energetic, as well as its spiritual aspects. It emphasizes on the \"Vis medicatrix\" the \"healing power of nature\" better known as \"the inborn ability of the human body to respond to the insult of illness or injury and restore itself to health in most episodes of disease or trauma (Whorton, 2002, p. 6).\" The goal for treatment is boosting the ecological condition to favor self-regulatory capacity. Physicians in the eastern world are trained to examine skin, complexion, bones, channels, smells, sounds, mental state, preferences, emotions, tongue, pulse, demeanor, and body build to discern patterns that underlie a patient's complaints. TCM's wholistic approach to healing addresses the underlying cause of disease, and allows the body to heal itself naturally. Physicians are taught to treat the cause not just the symptoms of an illness so that the body can function more efficiently and therefore ensuring true health. *24-hour online scheduling!

She takes the time to assess the situation each time that I come in and she explains everything in a thorough and understandable manner. The office staff is extremely pleasant and very helpful! When I was hurting and needed to be seen quickly, they made it easy for me to make an appointment as soon as possible! I have never had to wait and I'm in and out quickly. My husband and I are both very pleased with our experience here. I would recommend this office to anyone!\" Olivia S. May 26, 2016 I found out about this place from its high rating. And consequently, the experience was actually beyond expectations. The atmosphere is friendly and familial, and you will find cultural and philosophical connection, you will enrich your horizon. The treatment is exquisite. my results were spectacular. I came in with a \"grade\" of health of 70% or less in all my problems (leg terrible pain and immobility, beck pain, etc) and in only 4 weeks or so I \"graduated\" with 97% health status. The treatment is scientific and professional to the highest extent. Dr. Fleming taught at several universities and now she is also faculty at ERAU in Daytona Beach. She wouldn't hesitate to write you long explanatory emails and she would not give you a general treatment or exercises for home. She would study your problems and come up with the most efficient solutions. Excellent place, perfect treatment. I fly, so often I have to squeeze in the cockpit for hours. She has solutions for this. Actually, a lot of pilots, flight instructors and ERAU faculties take treatment at her place. I highly recommend this! Andy L. August 10, 2017 \"I definitely recommend Dr. Fleming; she has helped me tremendously with my TMJ issues which none of my doctors could figure out what was wrong. She seems quite knowledgeable and is very pleasant to chat with. Big thumbs up to her :).\" Judy F. October 5, 2016 \"Visited Dr. Fleming for the first time with extreme tightness and pain in my lower back. Left feeling much better. Dr. Fleming is extremely professional and knowledgeable. She takes the time to listen to what your symptoms are. She is the most compassionate doctor that I have ever used. I would definitely recommend her to anyone.\" Bob F. April 26, 2017 \"Dr. Fleming is a credit to her profession, she has that magic touch to alleviate your back problems and keep them from returning. I strongly recommend her to friends and family and any one else looking to ease their back troubles.\" Christopher S. "}
