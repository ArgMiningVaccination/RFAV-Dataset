Stephan Gevorkian, 44, worked as a doctor at his own clinic, Pathways Medical, in Toluca Lake. There, he treated thousands of individuals,' a release from the [Los Angeles](/news/los-angeles/index.html) County District Attorney's Office states. The 'doctor' was discovered after an undercover officer visited the clinic in November and received a consultation where Gevorkian 'allegedly failed to accurately address abnormal levels of a hormone that could indicate a serious medical condition.' Gevorkian has been charged with five counts of practicing medicine without a license. The man's lawyers are pushing back at DA's charges, saying: 'Any suggestion that Mr. Gevorkian was impersonating a doctor in an effort to deceive and treat unsuspecting patients is misleading and demonstrably false.' A SoCal man treated thousands of patients - including individuals with cancer - without a medical license, prosecutors allege, until he was caught by an undercover investigator Stephan Gevorkian, 44, worked as a doctor at his own clinic, Pathways Medical, in Toluca Lake. There, he treated thousands of individuals,' a release from the LA District Attorney states Gevorkian operated out of Pathways Medical in Toluca Lake, California On its social media pages, Pathways Medical describes itself as an alternative medicine provider that specializes in intravenous vitamin therapy. According to prosecutors, Gevorkian saw patients with 'serious conditions' for years, treating maladies like viral infections to individuals with cancer. 'The business conducts blood tests on patients, advises them on treatments and offers treatment for serious conditions,' a press release reads. The undercover officer went into the business on November 17, 2022 and received results that investigators said raised red flags. The doctor and those in his office failed to notice 'abnormal levels of a hormone that could indicate a serious medical condition,' the release states. It's unclear what first caught police attention, however, one Yelp reviewer called into question the legitimacy of the doctor's title several years ago. 'I think Dr. G is a fraud,' Yelp reviewer Nicole B. [wrote](https://www.yelp.com/biz/pathways-medical-toluca-lake?rr=1) in 2021. 'The only thing 'right' with my blood work was my Vitamin D level. WHAT THE HELL? I am sitting here looking at my estimate for treatments which tops out at just under 5K....... I ran,' the woman wrote. 'So, that's my story on Dr. G......... don't get suckered into supporting this office and these rude people,' she continued. According to prosecutors, Gevorkian (right) saw patients with 'serious conditions' for years, treating maladies like viral infections to individuals with cancer By all other accounts, the 'doctor' was beloved in his community. Since 2019, Pathways has received dozens of glowing reviews from patients and currently has a 4.5 star rating on Yelp. 'This place is incredible. They really know what they are doing and DrG is a game changer in the natural world,' one person wrote in February. 'This company is amazing,' another reviewer wrote. 'The doctor was so kind and understanding of my concerns.' 'I have been coming here for years and I cannot say enough good things about Dr.G and his staff. They go above and beyond and provide unmatchable results and service,' a woman said in 2019. The five-star reviews did not stop the investigation and the complaint against Gevorkian, which was filed on April 19. Gevorkian's lawyers were subsequently notified of the warrant. Gevorkian was arraigned on the charges against him Friday and was later released on his own recognizance under the condition that he not practice medicine. Gevorkian was never arrested, a DA spokesperson told local outlets. 'Practicing medicine without a license is not only a criminal activity in California, it can cause irreparable harm to the health of unsuspecting people, some with serious illnesses, who believe they are under the care of a licensed physician,' DA George Gasc\u00f3n said. 'Practicing medicine without a license is not only a criminal activity in California, it can cause irreparable harm to the health of unsuspecting people, some with serious illnesses, who believe they are under the care of a licensed physician,' DA George Gasc\u00f3n said Gevorkian's attorney, Justin E. Sterling, told ABC7 Los Angeles: 'Criminal charges by their very nature are unproven accusations.' 'It's important to acknowledge that what is thought to be known or understood early on is not always the case in the end. Mr. Gevorkian is complying with all orders of the court and looks forward to vigorously defending himself against these allegations.' Gevorkian will next go before a judge on May 24 for his first hearing. The Los Angeles County DA's Office is currently pursuing any additional victims.
