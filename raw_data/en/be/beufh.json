Appendix of monoclonal antibodies Company Technology immortalized with high efficiency using Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the presence of a Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist, while plasma cells are maintained in single-cell cultures by using interleukin 6 (IL-6) or stromal cells; functional assays used to identify rare antibodies. In vitro antibody discovery/optimization triple-mode platform with proprietary self-diversifying libraries (N-terminal and VHH libraries), rapid target-directed cell sorting approach Bispecific AbZ2 single-chain antibodies: fusing a single domain antibody onto the C-terminus of another VHH fragment Developed methodologies that allow 'in format' phage display selection and screening of bispecific antibodies early in discovery. Novimmune's kappa-lambda ( ) platform generates fully IgG molecules undistinguishable from a standard human IgG. Fully human antibody library (xEmplar) precisely designed to replicate the natural immune repertoire with an eye for improved developability. Optimized CDR compositions and framework selection combined with the elimination of amino acid motifs that increase aggregation and off-target reactivity results in a library that yields many diverse and developable hits. The xPloration functional screening platform enables functional screens measuring functional activity of millions of antibody variants within hours using microcapillary arrays.Memory B cells are activated and amplified using Epstein-Barr virus infection, co-cultured with CHO-muCD40L cells, and then assessed by functional screenings. An in vitro transcription and translation (IVTT) approach was used to analyze variable (V) genes recovered from each B cell sample and identify the relevant heavy/light chain pair(s). Ecobody technology: rapid and cost-effective monoclonal antibody screening method from single animal B cells using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and Escherichia coli cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS), which allows evaluation of antibodies within two working days.2 3Vir Bio isolated potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies against influenza and four different paramyxoviruses 1 Preclinical monospecific and bispecific antibodies for the treatment of human and animal diseases in oncology, ophthalmology, CNS disorders, Lyme disease, virus-induced encephalitis and influenza 4 Seven candidates in the preclinical pipeline for oncology 65Immortalized cell and in vitro transcription/translation technologies Novel display and bispecific monoclonal antibody technologies (table continues on next page) Appendix 34 | Expanding access to monoclonal antibody-based Signaling technologyImmuno-proteogenomics (combining mass with next- generation sequencing of antibodies in serum) Proteomics approach that identifies antigen-specific antibody sequences directly from circulating polyclonal antibodies in the serum of an immunized animal. The approach involves affinity purification of antibodies followed by analysis using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. High-confidence peptide spectral matches of antibody variable regions are obtained by searching a reference database created by next-generation DNA sequencing of the B-cell immunoglobulin repertoire of the immunized animal. Finally, heavy and light chain sequences are paired and expressed as recombinant monoclonal antibodies.Partners: Genentech, Merck, Mapp BioPharm; spin-off company from Univ San Diego 7 Isolated monoclonal antibodies for five antigens from the sera of immunized rabbits and mice that surpass binding by the original affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies 8 Company Technology Notes/References Company Technology Notes/ReferencesUniversity Austin George Georgiou Adimab/ ArsanisUse high-throughput sequencing to discover specific human antibodies. Single B cells (>5 \u00d7 104 capacity per experiment) are deposited in a high-density microwell plate (125 pl/well) and lysed in situ . mRNA is then captured on magnetic beads, reverse transcribed and amplified by emulsion VH:VL linkage PCR. The linked transcripts are analyzed by Illumina high- throughput sequencing. Proprietary microfluidic technology that allows the ultra-high throughput analysis of isolated cells in miniaturized (pL to nL) picodroplets - enables faster, less costly and more effective sample screening and discovery of antigen-specific antibody discovery. Cyto-Mine\u00ae technology is the first integrated device to be able to automatically perform all of these crucial techniques in a single compact system. ESI-Mine platform can be used for high-throughput mass spectrometry (MS) analysis - splits picodroplet for MS and the other part for growth on a chip so that it can be retrieved.High-throughput screening assay incorporated into microwells/ microfluidic chambers Flow Cytometry - B cell cloning technology that works with yeast-based antibody discovery and optimization platform9 12Adimab has over 280 antibody discovery programs with 20 in the clinical stages.

Adimab has applied this technology to Ebola, RSV, CD3, and Zika as academic and NGO partnerships. 1110 (table continues on next page) Appendix 35 | Expanding access to monoclonal antibody-based which single cells are compartmentalized in tens of thousands of 40-pL droplets and analyzed in two-dimensional droplet arrays using a fluorescence relocation-based immunoassay. System enables immune monitoring and optimization of immunization and vaccination protocols and antibody screening. Ligand's OmniAb\u00ae platforms (OmniRat\u00ae, OmniMouse\u00ae and OmniFlic\u00ae) are based on novel, transgenic rodents that produce highly diversified antibody repertoires. This platform offers accelerated discovery of fully human mono- and bispecific antibodies that are naturally optimized in vivo for manufacturability, therapeutic efficacy and reduced immunogenicity. Knock-in mouse The Kymouse strains have more than 5.4 million base-pairs of the human immunoglobulin genes in their genome \u2014 more than any other model. In IntelliSelect, we capture all relevant antibody sequences from single B cells, understand their evolutionary relationships and convert them into expression vectors to generate recombinant antibodies for high-throughput assays. VelociMouse\u00ae enables immediate generation of genetically altered mice directly from modified embryonic stem cells. Shortened the time needed to engineer genetically modified mice, while at the same time reducing costs and improving precision. Heavy chain repertoires from immunized transgenic OminRats were combined with common light chains from existing therapeutic antibodies in novel yeast surface display Fab libraries, and screened for binders by yeast surface display. Strategy represents a combination of in vivo immunization with an in vitro selection method, which allows for the integration of existing therapeutic antibodies into a bispecific format.Proprietary cell-spot, B-cell multiplexed screening and cloning technology; simultaneous screening on ten different parameters such as specificity, affinity, and cross-reactivity with other antigensPreclinical pipeline with ten candidates for immunology and oncology 13 16 Atopic dermatitis mAb in phase II, two cancer mAbs in phase I testing.
