METHODS: Twenty-seven Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups.The stress-induced hypertensive rat model was prepared by electricfoot-shocks combined with generated noise. Mold-ing cycle lasted for 14 days and EA intervene wasapplied on rats in model + EA group during modelpreparation. Rat Gene 2.0 Sense Target Array tech-nology was used for the determination of gene ex-pression profiles and the screened key genes wereverified by real-time quantitative polymerase chainreaction(RT-PCR)method. RESULTS: Compared with blank control group, 390 genes were changed in model group; compared with model control group, 330 genes werechanged in model+EA group. Significance analysisof gene function showed that the differentially ex-pressed genes are those involved in biological pro-cess, molecular function and cellular components.RT-PCR result of the screened key genes is consis-tentwiththatofgenechiptest. CONCLUTION: EA could significantly lower blood pressure of stress-induced pre-hypertension rats and affect its gene expression profile in heart.Genes that related to the contraction of vascularsmooth muscle may be involved refers to high blood pres- sure that caused by the long-term tension and stress.1A modern life style with fast pace can cause psychologicaland emotional stress, which may develop into a gradu-al increase in hypertension in young adults.Present studies showed that stress-induced hyperten- 285 CORE Metadata, citation and similar papers at core.ac.uk Provided by Elsevier - Publisher Connector JTCM|www.journaltcm.com June15,2015 |Volume35 |Issue3|GuoYetal./ExperimentalStudy sion is medulla (SAM) system,3renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS).4 The 7th report released by the Joint National Commit-tee report on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation,and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-7) point-ed out that, pre-hypertension is a transition stage dur-ing which the blood pressure rises from normal to diag-nostic hypertension. In this stage, the systolic bloodpressure ranges between 120-139 mm Hg and (or) dia- stolic blood pressure between 80-89 mm Hg. 5The study found that incidence of cardiovascular events inpeople with pre-hypertension in future time was as twotimes as people with normal blood pressure. 5It is also proved that stress-induced hypertension is preceded bydamage of target organs like blood vessels, heart, brain,and changes of the expression of relative proteins andgenes. 6,7Also, studies showed that treatment in the pre-hypertension stage can significantly reduce admis-sion rate and mortality of hypertensive patients, andenhance the protection of target organs of the disease. 8 Electro-acupuncture therapy was widely applied in thetreatment of various kinds of hypertension-related car-diovascular diseases in clinical practices. 9Lots of re- searches confirmed that acupuncture reduces bloodpressure by immune system, nervous system, and vascu-lar endothelial cell. 10,11 Gene chip technology, characterized by high sensitivi-ty and throughput, is a new method to analyze gene ex-pression. It could detect multiple gene expression atthe same time which provides a platform for the studyof multiple genes influenced hypertension. 12However, previous researches on treatment of hypertension weremore concentrated on anti-hypertensive treatment andprotection of target organs, which are applied in themiddle and late stages. Fewer researches were focusedon gene expression and intervention of pre-hyperten-sion.In this study we will explore the effect of acupunctureon stress-induced pre-hypertension, and try to system-atically reveal its biological mechanisms from the as-pect of gene by monitoring key genes and targets withgene chip technology, thereby, providing a newidea for the prevention and treatment of pathogen free Ltd., License number: SCXK (Bei-jing) 200223. Experimental animals were raised in acontrolled environment with a temperature of (20 \u00b11), humidity of 50%, and 12-h light-dark cycle wasmaintained throughout the whole study. All proce-dures for animal experiments were conducted in ac-cordance with World Health Organization's Interna-tional Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research In-volving Animalsand were approved by the Animal Re-search Ethics Board of Beijing University of ChineseMedicine. Grouping Twenty-seven 9-week-old Specified Pathogen Free(SPF) Wistar male rats of (220 \u00b1 30) g were randomly divided into 3 groupsby random number table meth-od: blank control group, model control group, andmodel + EA group ( n= hypertensive rat (SIHR) model wasestablishedbyelectricfoot-shockscombinedwithgener-atednoise.Ratsinmodelcontrolgroupandmodel+EAgroup were placed in a cage (22 cm \u00d7 22 cm \u00d7 26 cm)with a grid floor and received electric foot-shocks (30V, 5 ms duration, 2-25 s intervals)and noises (80-100db) produced by a buzzer (MG-2TYPE, Huai BeiZheng Hua, Anhui, China) randomly delivered by acomputer. The procedure repeated twice a day (8:00 to10:00 in the morning and 2:00 to 4:00 in the after- noon). Rats in blank control group were put into thesame cage in the same time period, with nofoot-shocks or noise. Intervention All the rats in three groups were loosely immobilizedin a specially made restrainer with four limbs exposed.Taichong (LR 3) is located in the dorsum of the foot,in the depression anterior to the junction of the firstand second metatarsals. Quchi (LI 11) is located at theproximal end of radius, in the depression lateral and an-terior to the elbow joint.Model + EA group: the needles (0.32 mm \u00d7 25 mm, purchased from Suzhou Acupuncture Goods Co., Ltd.,Suzhou, China) were directly inserted into Taichong(LR 3) and Quchi (LI 11) bilaterally for about 1.5-2 mm and 4 mm respectively. After the insertion, Hans (LH202H, Si Sheng Da, Beijing, China) wasconnected with Quchi (LI 11) and Taichong (LR 3) toform a circulation of 1mA with a frequency of 2 Hz. The needles were then withdrawn after a 20 minutes'retention. The acupuncture intervention took once aday (from 5 pm) since the first day of model prepara-tion for 14 days. All the intervention was given by thesame person. Blank control group and model controlgroup: rats were immobilized in the same restrainer for20 min without acupuncture intervention. Samplesobtaining After the measurement of caudal artery blood pressureat the 15th day, rats were sacrificed after anesthetizedby technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). Heart were obtained on the ice,washed with 4 saline, dried, fixed in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80refrigerator. MeasurementofbloodpressureTwo hours after the stimulation of model preparation,systolic pressure of caudal artery was measured in a con-trolled environment at of a temperature of (22 \u00b1 2) . Sober rats were preheated in 36 for 15 min. Then the systolic pressure was measured with noninvasiveblood pressure instrument when the rat is quiet andconscious. Each rat was measured for 3 times with theaverage blood pressured recorded. Blood pressure wasrecorded one day before and at the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th and 15th day after modeling. Samplepreparationandmicroarrayimageanalysis Total RNA was separately extracted from all the 27 in-dividual samples using the mirVana miRNA isolationKit (P/N Carlsbad,NM,USA). Microarray analysis was performed and repeated3 times using a biological sample in each group withGene Chip Rat Gene 2.0 ST Array (Affymetrix, SantaClara, CA, USA). Total RNA of each sample was usedfor labeling and array hybridization. The labeling andhybridization steps were carried out according to theAffymetrix protocol (Gene Chip WT PLUS ReagentKit, P/N using the Affymetrix Gene Chip645 System and followed by washing with the Affyme-trix Gene Chip 450 System. Array scanning using theAffymetrix Gene Chip 7G microarray scanner (Affyme-trix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Dataanalysis Scanned images were then imported into AffymetrixExpression console software (Affymetrix, Santa Clara,CA, USA) for grid alignment and expression data anal-ysis. Expression data were normalized through quantilenormalization in the Affymetrix Expression consolesoftware (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The 27gene level files were imported into Transcriptome Anal-ysis console further analysis. Gene expression profilesof model control group were compared to those fromblank control group or model + EA group. Thechanged genes were selected by the criteria: P< 0.05 and fold changes 1.5. Genefunctionalannotation The DAVID 6.7b of DAVID Bioinformatics Resourc-es (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/) was used to performgene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. The biologi-cal process, cellular component and molecular func-tions were analyzed simultaneously. Differentially ex-pressed genes of model control group ( vsblank control group) or model + EA group ( vsmodel control group) dataset were selected and were tested against the back-ground set of all genes present in the AffymetrixGeneChip Gene 2.0 ST Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Clusteringandtreeviewforidentifiedtranscripts Hierarchical clustering was performed with help of-Cluster 3.0 (Michiel de Hoon Laboratory, Palo Alto,CA, USA). A list was prepared of the selected genes tobe clustered. The normal signal data of selected geneswere adjusted to log transform data. Then the data wasarranged according to the requirements of Cluster 3.0and \"median\" was selected for center genes and arrays. Selecteddifferentiallyexpressedgenesvalidation Total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA with a re-verse transcription kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad,NM,USA). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain re-action (qRT-PCR) method was used to detect gene ex-pression by RT-PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems,Foster city, CA, USA) with Power SYBR Green PCRMaster Mix kit (Applied Biosystems,Foster city, CA,USA). We used primer express software (Applied Bio-systems, Foster city, CA, USA) to design primers (Ta-ble1).-actinwasselectedasaninternalreference.Am- plification conditions are as follows: 1 cycle of 10 min at 95, 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 and 1min at 60 . After cycling, a melting protocol was performed with15at95,15sat60 and15at95 intheend.Af- ter the end of the experiment RQ Manager 1.2.1 (Ap- plied Biosystems, Foster city, CA, USA) and Data As-sist V3.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA,USA) were used for the calculation of Ct value. CT method was used for the relative quantification of thegene expression, target gene: = 2 -Ct. All data were ana- lyzed using SAS 9.0 statistical software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Quantitative data are expressedas the mean \u00b1 standard deviation ( x\u00b1s). The single factor analysis of variance of completely randomizeddesign was used for parameter comparison betweengroups.P <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS BloodpressureSystolic blood pressure of Wistar rats in blank controlgroup stayed normal through the whole process of theexperiment. Systolic blood pressure in model controlgroup reached higher than 120 mm Hg (P < 0.01) at the 3rd day, and kept increasing to a significantly high- er level when measured at the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 11th, 13th and 15th days during model preparation ( P <0.01), compared with that of the blank control group. In themodeling process, model control group were of elevat-ed blood pressure, irritation, squealing, gnawing, hardstool, yellow urination, rough hair and bloodshot eyes.With the value kept in the range between 120-139mm Hg, the model was successfully established. 287JTCM|www.journaltcm.com June15,2015 |Volume35 |Issue3|GuoYetal./ExperimentalStudy Compare with model control group, systolic blood pressure in model + EA group remarkably decreased atthe 5th, 7th, 9th day (all P <0.01) and 11th, 13th and 15th days during EA <0.05), 3) and Quchi (LI 11) can significantly lower the blood pressure of stress-in-duced pre-hypertension rats with better short-term ef-fects (Figure 1). Geneexpressionchanges Gene microarray analysis showed that there were 390gene expressions changed in model control group com-pared to blank control group. Of these, 182 were down-regulated and 208 were up-regulated. EA inter- vention changed 330 gene expressions compared withmodel control group. Among these genes, 169 weredown-regulated and 161 were up-regulated (P < 0.05and fold change 1.5 were identified). Gene microar-ray analysis showed that there were 71 genes whose ex- pression up-regulated in the model control group ( vs blank control group) but down-regulated in model +EA group ( vsmodel control group) (Table 2); and 37 genes whose expression down-regulated in the modelcontrol group (vs blank control group) but up-regulat- ed in model + EA group ( vsmodel control group) (Ta- ble 3).

Validationofgenesexpression To validate the microarray results, we selected severaltranscripts to cluster (Figure 3A) and validated the clus-tering result using qRT-PCR (Figure 3B). These geneswere selected based on fold change differences, previ-ous association with blood pressure regulation, and/orinvolvement in processes that may influence bloodpressure.The expression of heat shock 70 kDa protein(HSPA1A) (P < 0.01), heat shock protein beta-1 (HSPB1) (P < 0.01), oxidized low-density (P = 0.035), < 2 (PTGS2) (P = 0.041) was significantlyhigher in model control group compared to blank con-trol group. HSPA1A (P < 0.01), HSPB1 (P < 0.01), OLR1 (P < 0.01), PLA2G4A (P < 0.01) and PTGS2 (P =0.015) expression was significantly lower in mod- el + EA group when compared to model control group.To some extent, the identified results confirmed the re-liability of the array analysis. DISCUSSION Hypertension affects approximately 1 billion individu-als worldwide. 13It is believed that high-pressure envi- ronment is crucial for the prevalence of hyperten-sion and coronary diseases. 2Stress-induced hyperten- sion usually results from endocrine disorders related vasopressin, aldosterone, cortisol, and catecholamines. 14Previous researches up-regulated in model control group ( vsblank control group) but down-regulated in model in model control group /gene expression level in blank control group.

Positive values indicate higher expression in model samples, while negative values indicate lower expression in model + zinc finger and BTB domain containing 16 ; HSPA1A: heat shock 70 kDa protein 1A;REG3G: were more concentrated on anti-hypertensive treatment and protection of target or-gans, fewer researches were focused on intervention ofpre-hypertension. However, it has been proved that ear-ly stage treatment could effectively reduce the inci-dence of high blood pressure, and protect target or-gans. 15Therefore, in this study, we focused on the early stage of pre-hypertension to observe the EA's effect onanti-hypertensive.In the present study, the stress-induced hypertensivemodel is well established by electric foot-shocks com-bined with generated noise, 16it may simulate the pres- ent environment in which humans live: high work pres- sures and fast paced.16 Our results show that, compared with the blank con-trol group, rats in the model control group got signifi-cantly increased blood pressure from the third day(higher than 120 mm Hg), suggesting a successfullyprepared pre-hypertension model. The blood pressure continuously rose and reached higher than 140 mmHg at the 15th day, supporting the theory that repeat-ed chronic physical or emotional stress could lead tothe elevation of blood pressure. 9 The traditional Chinese medicinal theory of preventivetreatment of disease shows its unique advantages in pre-venting and treating pre-hypertension and high bloodpressure. Especially the acupuncture, it could reduceblood pressure by unblocking the meridians and pacify-ing the liver to subdue Yang. 17 Syndromeis the basic unit and a key concept in TCM theory, all diagnostic and therapeutic methods inTCMare based on the differentiation of TCM syndrome.Previous studies have shown that Syndromes of hyper-tension are always divided into liver Yanghyperactivity syndrome and liver-kidney Yindeficiency syndrome. 18 In the modeling process of our study, stress-induced hy-pertension rats were of elevated blood pressure, irrita- tion, squealing, gnawing, hard stool, yellow urina-tion, rough hair and bloodshot eyes, which were simi-lar to performance of liver Yanghyperactivity syn-Table 3 Selected genes Down-regulated in the model control group (vs blank control group) but up-regulated in model + level in model control group/gene expression level in blank control group.

Gene chip technology, char-acterized by high sensitivity and throughput, providesa platform for the study of multiple genes influ-enced hypertension. 20However, fewer researches are fo- cused on the gene expression in pre-hypertension andthe relation between pre-hypertension and gene expres-sion has not been confirmed. In this study, genechip results showed that significant differences of geneexpression existed among blank control group, modelcontrol group and model + EA group. Some of themhave already been related to hypertension.It is proved that hypertension is preceded by damage oftarget organs like blood vessels, heart, brain and kid-ney. 6,7Besides, the abnormal vascular function, which may be the reason for the damage of target organs likeheart, brain and kidney, is an important initial link in the development of cardiovascular and cerebrovasculardiseases. It is also demonstrated that impaired Relative Figure3Selectedtranscriptsclusteredandvalidatedwithreal-timePCR.First,selectedgeneswereclusteredusingCluster3.0ac- is relatively up-regulated and green is relatively down-regulated in different samples.

Blank control group: wistar stress-induced hypertensive rat model was established by electricfoot-shocks combined with generated noise. These transcripts analyzed here showed coherent profiles with cluster A. qRT-PCR:quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction; HSPA1A: heat shock with inflammation and the level of oxidative stress.6Altered genes which are related to the cyto-skeleton and the contraction of vascular smooth mus-cle, up-regulated in model control group when com-pared with blank control group, but down-regulated genes are consistent with the also known as phospholipase A2 (cytosol-ic phospholipaseA2, cPLA2), plays an importantrole in inflammation reactions. It is closely related tothe cell proliferation and apoptosis after being activat-ed through phosphorylation. 21It is believed that in the hypertension condition, cPLA2 could accelerate cell proliferation, leading to the proliferation and aggrega-tion of interstitial collagen fiber, the remodeling oflarge artery, and the decrease of its elasticity and com-pliance. 22Our result indicated that PLA2G4A gene may be one of the target genes of stress-induced pre-hy-pertension. Electro-acupuncture intervention can re-duce expression of PLA2G4A, indicating relation be-tween anti-hypertensive effect of EA and regulation ofPLA2G4A gene. The specific mechanism needs to befurther studied.HSPB1, also known as heat shock protein 25(HSP25). HSPA1A, also called HSP70. HSPB1 andHSPA1A proteins belong to the HSP family. HSPgenes were activated when the cell was damaged bystressors of various kinds, and therefore act as biomark- er of stress response of the cell. Activated HSP genescan improve cell tolerance to stressors, take part in theendogenous protective mechanisms of cardiovascularsystem and play an important role in the pathologicalprocess of cardiovascular diseases. 23In stress conditions like ischemia, to ischemic injury, 24indicating that HSPB1 is an important kind of heat shock protein with protec-tive function in myocardial tissues. The mechanismmay concerns the stabilization and repair of the struc-ture of damaged cytoskeletal proteins or nuclear pro-teins of myocardial tissue. In recent years many re-searches also focus on the HSPA1A. Reports showedthat the increased amount of serum HSPA1A antibodyis positively correlated to the elevation of blood pres-sure, indicating that HSPA1A gene is closely related tohypertension. 25The underlying mechanism may con- cern HSPA1A's influence endothelial cellfunction by taking antioxidation, modulation of immune system and vascular stress.In our study, the elevated expression of HSPB1 andHSPA1A gene indicates that endogenous protection ofthe cardiovascular system has been activated by stress,HSPB1 and HSPA1A are involved in the developmentof hypertension, which is consistent with previous re- searches. After EA intervention, we speculate that EAcould improve the stress state of the rat and slow downthe cellular stress responses to avoid the excessive stressdamage while lowering the blood pressure. Its specificmechanism needs to be further studied.The expression of PTGS2, also known as cyclooxygen-ase-2. In many pathological conditions, various inter-nal and external environmental stimuli could induceits over-expression in vascular endothelial cells, vascularsmooth muscle cells, and macrophages that are closelyrelated to inflammation. Research showed that PTGS2expression up-regulated in atherosclerosis. may ag- gravate the condition increasing vascular per-meability and promoting the migration of macro-phage, the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines(such as IL-6 and IL-8), the migration and prolifera-tion of smooth muscle cells, and the synthesis of extra-cellular matrix. 27It is also reported that PTGS2 can in- duce the synthesis of vascular growth factor and the an-giogenesis aggravate the form and expansion of athero-sclerotic plaque. 28The gene chip results showed that PTGS2 gene may be one of the target genes instress-induced pre-hypertension and plays an impor-tant role in the development of stress-induced hyper-tension. EA may be an effective way to constrainPTGS2 level to treat atherosclerosis caused by hyper-tension.OLR1 is the specific receptor of oxiding low density li-poprotein (Ox-LDL). 29Ox-LDL plays an important role in the pathological process of atherosclerosis be-cause it can activate endothelial cells to release adhe-sion molecules and chemokines. 30In recent years, stud- ies have shown that Ox-LDL can initiate CD40/CD40L endothelial cell signaling pathway throughOLR1 and participate in the expression of inflammato-ry molecules and activation, dysfunction and injury ofendothelial cells. 31,32Our study showed that OLR1 gene may be one of the target genes in stress-inducedpre-hypertension and closely related to development ofstress-induced hypertension. EA's antihypertensive ef-fect may be related with the regulation of OLR1gene, with the underlying mechanism to be furtherstudied.In conclusion, our study proved that EA at Taichong(LR 3) and Quchi (LI 11) can significantly lower theblood pressure of stress-induced pre-hypertension ratsand affect its gene expression profile in heart. It mayperform anti-hypertensive regulation on stress-in-duced pre-hypertension viavarious ways. We specu- late that genes that related to the contraction of vas-cular smooth muscle may be involved in the mecha-nism. REFERENCES 1Kawashima Y , Akishita M, Hasegawa H, Kozaki K, Toba K.
