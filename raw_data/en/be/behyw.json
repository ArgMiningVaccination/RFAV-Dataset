Holistic Review considers the \"whole\" applicant. Holistic Review refers to mission-aligned admissions or selection processes that take into consideration applicants' experiences, attributes, and academic metrics as well as the value an applicant would contribute to learning, practice, and teaching. Holistic Review allows admissions committees to consider the \"whole\" applicant, rather than disproportionately focusing on any one factor. The core principles of holistic review are outlined below. Core Principles - Applicant selection criteria are broad, clearly linked to school mission and goals, and promote numerous aspects of diversity as essential to excellence. - Selection criteria include experiences and attributes as well as academic performance. These criteria are: - Used to assess applicants in light of their unique backgrounds and with the intent of creating a richly diverse interview and selection pool and student body, - Applied equitably across the entire candidate pool, and - Supported by student performance data that show that certain experiences or characteristics are linked to that individual's likelihood of success as a student and/or physician. - Schools consider each applicant's potential contribution to both the school and the field of medicine, allowing them the flexibility to weigh and balance the range of criteria needed in a class to achieve their institutional mission and goals. Tools and Resources The AAMC has compiled tools and resources to assist admissions officers and program directors in applying holistic review to their selection processes.

The strategies were developed in collaboration with innovators and leaders in medical school admissions and are applicable in all states regardless of ability to consider race and ethnicity. To make it easy to use, we've provided both a PDF and Word version of the checklist tool; the PDF includes additional contextual information.

This segment showcases two schools, the University of Kansas School of Medicine and the University of Maryland School of Medicine, that have actively identified their institutional mission and the health concerns of their community or region and aligned their admissions policies and criteria accordingly. Additional resource: [There is No Admission without Mission transcript (PDF)](https://www.aamc.org/media/68976/download?attachment) University of Kansas School of Medicine Resources [Pre-Med Advisors Conference](https://www.kumc.edu/school-of-medicine/academics/premedical-programs/premedical-student-conference.html): Each year, Kansas physicians, scientists, advisors, and potential medical students come together for this one-day conference about health care and medical education. Features include discussions about the MCAT and applying to medical school, tips for successful admissions interviews, and question-and-answer sessions with physicians and medical students. The annual conference is intended for students who are interested in medicine who are currently in an undergraduate program or completed a degree, and premedical advisors. [Application Toolkit](https://www.kumc.edu/school-of-medicine/academics/degree-programs/md-program/admission-and-aid/application-toolkit.html): This toolkit was developed to address a few questions the admissions committee thought were important to address such as: - What is holistic review? - What are we looking for? - What does our interview process look like? - How do you prepare for that process? Another audience for this toolkit is advisors. A lot of smaller schools in Kansas do not have formal pre-med advisors, and they wanted to develop a resource that would help anyone who was advising a student, whether it was a faculty member or a trusted mentor, to have accurate information about the admissions process. This resource is still under development. Socially Accountable Admissions: Using a different lens to evaluate medical school applicants and promote workforce diversity This webinar highlights effective strategies UC-Davis School of Medicine has used to increase enrollment of historically underrepresented and excluded students and to achieve institutional community health goals. Admissions tools, recruitment policies and practices, community partnerships, innovative pathways programs, mission-focused school tracks, and the use of a socio-economic disadvantage score in a race-neutral admissions process are all described. Mitigating Bias in the Admissions Process This presentation is an excerpt from the 2022 AMCAS Cycle Opening and Mitigating Bias in the Admissions Process webinar held on June 10, 2021. The purpose of this segment is to raise awareness of how bias can influence the admissions process as well as steps individuals, their committees, and reviewers can take to mitigate bias. The presentation featured 3 speakers who focused on different aspects of bias in admissions. Below you will find information about each speaker, as well as their area of focus for the presentation.

Through active learning, the curriculum incorporates committee comments and highlights admissions structures to illustrate what bias can look like and sound like. Each bias type is illustrated with original graphics designed by medical students and is accompanied by concrete strategies for illuminating and mitigating the bias. There is also a review deck that can be incorporated into committee meetings, briefings, and trainings to encouraged space repetition and continuous practice. 2023 AMCAS Cycle Opening and Mitigating Structural Bias in the Admissions Process These two recordings are excerpts from the 2023 AMCAS Cycle Opening and Mitigating Structural Bias in the Admissions Process webinar that took place on June 14th, 2022.
