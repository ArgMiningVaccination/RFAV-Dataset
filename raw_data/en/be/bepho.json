For most people, a healthy diet includes the following: \u00celots of fruits, vegetables, and whole grain breads and cereals \u00cemodest amounts of lean protein and dairy products \u00cesmall amounts of sugar, alcohol, salt, and saturated and trans fats (such as those found in butter, meat, dairy, fast food, and fried foods) When you have cancer, though, you need to eat to keep your strength up in order to deal with the side effects of treatment. When you are healthy, eating enough food is often not a problem. But when you are dealing with cancer and treatment, this can be a real challenge. When you have cancer, you may need extra protein and calories. At times, your diet may need to include extra meat, fish, eggs, dairy, and plant-based proteins. If you have trouble chewing and swallowing, you may need to add sauces and gravies. Sometimes, you may need to eat low-fiber foods instead of high-fiber ones. A dietitian can help you with any diet changes you may need to make. Side effects from cancer treatment can lead to eating problems Cancer treatments are designed to kill cancer cells. But these treatments can also damage healthy cells. Damage to healthy cells can cause side effects that lead to eating problems. See the list on page 9 to see the types of eating problems that cancer treatment may cause. Common eating problems during cancer treatment include \u00ceappetite loss \u00cechanges in sense of taste or smell \u00cedry mouth \u00celactose intolerance trouble swallowing \u00cevomiting \u00ceweight gain \u00ceweight loss Y ou may have a poor appetite or nausea because you are stressed about cancer and treatment. But once you know what to expect, you may feel better. What you should know about cancer treatment, eating well, and eating problems 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237)2Getting ready for cancer treatment \u00ceTalk with your doctor or nurse about eating problems to watch for. Until treatment starts, you will not know what, if any, side effects or eating problems you may have. If you do have problems, they may be mild. Many side effects can be controlled and many problems go away when cancer treatment ends. \u00ceEat a healthy diet and maintain your weight before treatment starts. Eating a healthy diet and maintaining weight before treatment helps you stay strong, lower your risk for infection, cope with side effects, and have a greater chance of receiving treatment without unplanned breaks. \u00ceGo to the dentist. It is important to have a healthy mo uth before you start cancer treatment. \u00ceAsk your doctor, nurse, or dietitian about medicine that can help with eating problems. \u00ceDiscuss your fears and worries with your doctor, nurse, social worker, counselor, or psychologist. They can discuss ways to manage and cope with these feelings. \u00ceLearn about your cancer and its treatment. Many people feel better when they know what to expect. Ways you can get ready to eat well \u00ceFill the refrigerator, cupboard, and freezer with healthy foods. Make sure to include items you can eat even when you feel sick. \u00ceStock up on foods that need little or no cooking, such as healthy frozen dinners and ready-to-eat cooked foods. \u00ceCook foods ahead of time and freeze in meal-sized portions. \u00ceAsk friends or family to help you shop and cook during treatment. Maybe a friend can set up a schedule of the tasks that need to be done and the people who will do them. \u00ceCreate a grocery list of items you usually buy so that it is easy for friends and family to shop for you. \u00ceTalk with your doctor, nurse, or dietitian about what to expect. Y ou can find lists of foods and drinks to help with many types of eating problems on pages 41 to 53. www.cancer.gov 3Everyone is different Because everyone is different, there is no way to know if you will have problems with eating and, if so, how bad they will be. Y ou may have just a few problems or none at all. In part, this depends on the type of cancer you have, where it is in your body, what kind of treatment you have, how long treatment lasts, and the doses of treatment you receive. During treatment, there are many helpful medicines and other ways to manage eating problems. Y our doctor, nurse, or dietitian can tell you more about the types of issues you might expect and ways to manage them. If you start to have problems with eating, tell your doctor or nurse right away. If you start to have eating problems, tell your doctor or nurse right away. Talk with your doctor, nurse, or dietitian Talk with your doctor or nurse if you are not sure what to eat during cancer treatment. Ask them to refer you to a dietitian. A dietitian is the best person to talk with about your diet. They can help choose foods and drinks that are best for you during treatment and after. Make a list of questions for your meeting with the dietitian. Ask about your favorite foods and recipes and if you can eat them during cancer treatment. Y ou might want to find out how other patients manage their eating problems. Y ou can also bring this book and ask the dietitian to mark sections that are right for you. If you are already on a special diet for diabetes, kidney or heart disease, or other health problem, it is even more important to speak with a doctor and dietitian. Y our doctor and dietitian can advise you about how to follow your special diet while coping with eating problems caused by cancer treatment. For more information on how to find a dietitian, visit the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics at www.eatright.org/find-an-expert . 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237)4Ways to get the most from foods and drinks During treatment, you may have good days and bad days when it comes to what you are able to eat. Here are some ways to manage: \u00ceEat plenty of protein and calories when you can. This helps you keep up your strength and helps rebuild tissues harmed by cancer treatment. \u00ceEat when you have the biggest appetite. Y ou may want to eat a bigger meal when you are feeling your best and drink liquid meal replacements when your appetite is low. \u00ceIt's okay if you feel like you can't eat a lot of different foods. Eat the foods that sound good until you are able to eat more, even if it's the same thing again and again. Y ou might also drink protein shakes for extra nutrition. \u00ceDo not worry if you cannot eat at all some days. Spend this time finding other ways to feel better and start eating when you can. Tell your doctor if you cannot eat for more than 2 days. \u00ceDrink plenty of liquids. It is even more important to get plenty to drink on days when you cannot eat. Drinking a lot helps your body get the liquid it needs. Most adults should drink 8 to 12 cups of liquid a day. Y ou may find this easier to do if you keep a water bottle nearby. Also, try some of the clear liquids listed on page 41. Taking special care with food to avoid foodborne illness Some cancer treatments can make you prone to foodborne illness. When this happens, you need to take special care in the way you handle and prepare food. \u00ceKeep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. \u00cePut leftovers in the refrigerator as soon as you have finished eating. \u00ceScrub all raw fruits and vegetables with a brush and water before you eat them. \u00ceScrub fruits and vegetables that have rough surfaces and peels, such as melons, oranges, and avocados, with a brush and water before you cut or peel them. \u00ceSoak frozen fruits and vegetables in water and rinse if you are not going to cook them (for a smoothie, for instance). If cooking, you do not need to wash frozen fruits and vegetables. www.cancer.gov 5 \u00ceWash your hands, knives, and countertops before and after you prepare food. This step is most important when preparing raw meat, chicken, turkey, and fish. \u00ceWash your hands each time you touch raw meat, chicken, turkey, or fish. \u00ceUse one cutting board for meat and another one for fruits and vegetables. \u00ceThaw meat, chicken, turkey, and fish in the refrigerator or defrost them in the microwave. Cook meat, chicken, turkey, and eggs thoroughly. Eggs should be hard, not runny. Meats should not have any pink inside. To be sure meat, chicken, turkey, and fish is safe, use a meat thermometer and cook to the safe temperature. Refer to a safe minimum cooking temperature chart, such as the one available at https://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/charts/mintemp.html . \u00ceMake sure your juices, egg, and milk products are pasteurized. \u00ceEat shelled and roasted nuts. \u00ceEat only freshly cooked rice. Do not \u00ceEat produce that is not easily scrubbed in water, such as berries and grapes. \u00ceEat raw fish or shellfish, such as sushi and uncooked oysters. \u00ceEat raw nuts. \u00ceUse foods, condiments, or drinks that are past their freshness date. \u00ceBuy foods from bulk bins. \u00ceEat at buffets, salad bars, or self-service restaurants. \u00ceEat foods that show signs of mold, including moldy cheeses such as bleu cheese and Roquefort. \u00ceEat any perishable foods that have been sitting at room temperature longer than 2 hours. \u00ceEat leftovers that have been in the refrigerator longer than 3 days. \u00ceLeave meat, chicken, turkey, or fish sitting out to thaw. \u00ceEat leftover rice or leftovers that contain rice.

But there are no studies that prove that any special diet, food, vitamin, mineral, dietary supplement, herb, or combination of these can slow cancer, cure it, or keep it from coming back. In fact, some of these products can cause other problems by changing how your cancer treatment works. Tell your doctor, nurse, or dietitian about any vitamin, mineral, dietary supplements, or herbs you are already taking or plan to take. Also, talk with them before going on a special diet. For more information about complementary and alternative therapies, see Thinking About Complementary & Alternative Medicine: A Guide for People with Cancer, a booklet from the National Cancer Institute, at www.cancer.gov/publications/patient-education/thinking-about-cam. Special note for caregivers Do not be surprised or upset if your loved one's food preferences change from day to day. There may be days when they do not want a favorite food or say it now tastes bad. Keep food within easy reach. This way, your loved one can have a snack whenever they are ready to eat. Put a snack pack of applesauce or diced fruit along with a spoon on the bedside table. Keep roasted nuts on the counter. Or try keeping cut-up fruits and vegetables in the refrigerator. Eat fruits and vegetables with dips for extra calories and protein. Carrots go well with hummus and apples can be dipped in peanut butter. Offer gentle support rather than pushing your loved one to eat. Suggest that they drink plenty of clear and full liquids when they have no appetite. For ideas on clear liquids, see page 41, and for full liquids, see page 42. Talk with your loved one about ways to manage eating problems. Ask the doctor for a referral to a dietitian and meet with them together. Talking it through and seeking other advice can help you both feel more in control. For more information about coping with caregiving, see When Someone You Love Is Being Treated for Cancer , a booklet from the National Cancer Institute, at www.cancer.gov/ publications/patient-education/when-someone-you-love-is-being-treated . www.cancer.gov 7 Feelings can affect your appetite During cancer treatment, you may feel \u00cedepressed \u00ceanxious \u00ceafraid \u00ceangry \u00cehelpless \u00cealone It is normal to have these feelings. Although these are not eating problems, strong feelings like these can affect your interest in food, shopping, and cooking. Fatigue can also make it harder to cope. Coping with your feelings during cancer treatment There are many things you can do to cope with your feelings during treatment so they do not ruin your appetite. Here are some ideas that have worked for other people. \u00ceLearn about eating problems and other side effects before treatment starts. Many people feel more in control when they know what to expect and how to manage problems that may occur. \u00ceEat your favorite foods on days you feel well. This way, you can enjoy the foods, but they won't remind you of feeling poorly. \u00ceRelax, meditate, or pray. Activities like these help many people feel calm and less stressed. \u00ceExercise each day. Studies show that physical activity helps people with cancer feel better. Talk with your doctor or nurse about how much exercise to do while having cancer treatment. \u00ceTalk with someone you trust about your feelings. Y ou may want to talk with a close friend, family member, religious or spiritual leader, nurse, social worker, counselor, or psychologist. Y ou may also find it helpful to talk with someone who has gone through cancer treatment. \u00ceJoin a cancer support group. This can be a way to meet others dealing with problems like yours. In support group meetings, you can talk about your feelings and listen to other people talk about theirs. Y ou can also learn how others cope with cancer, treatment side effects, and eating problems. Ask your doctor, nurse, or social worker about support group meetings near you. Y ou may also want to know about support groups that meet over the internet. These can be very helpful if you cannot travel or there is no group that meets close by. 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237)8 \u00ceGet enough rest. Make sure you get at least 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night. During the day, spend time doing quiet activities such as reading or watching a movie. \u00ceDo not push yourself to do too much or more than you can manage. Look for easier ways to do your daily tasks. Many people feel better when they ask for or accept help from others. \u00ceBe active each day. Studies show that many people feel better when they take short walks or do light exercise each day. Being active like this can also help improve your appetite. \u00ceTalk with your doctor or nurse about medicine if you find it very hard to cope with your feelings.

Foods and liquids pass through the bowel so quickly that your body cannot absorb enough nutrition, vitamins, minerals, and water from them. This can cause dehydration (which occurs when your body has too little water). Diarrhea can be mild or severe and last a short or long time. Why it happens Diarrhea can be caused by cancer treatments such as radiation therapy to the abdomen or pelvis, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy. These treatments cause diarrhea because they can harm healthy cells in the lining of your large and small bowel. Diarrhea can also be caused by infections, medicine used to treat constipation, or antibiotics. Ways to manage with food \u00ceDrink plenty of fluids to replace those you lose from diarrhea and prevent dehydration. Examples include water, ginger ale, and sports drinks such as Gatorade and Propel. Y ou can see a list of more clear liquids on page 41. \u00ce Let carbonated drinks lose their fizz before you drink them. Add extra water if drinks make you thirsty or sick to your stomach. \u00ce Eat 5 or 6 small meals each day instead of 3 large meals. Many people find it easier to eat less food more often. \u00ceEat foods and drink liquids that are high in sodium and potassium . When you have diarrhea, your body loses these substances and it is important to replace them. Liquids with sodium include bouillon, fat-free broth, or sports beverages such as Gatorade or Propel. Foods high in potassium include bananas, tomatoes, and baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes. \u00ce Eat low-fiber foods . Low-fiber foods include plain or vanilla yogurt, white toast, and white rice. Y ou can find a list of more low-fiber foods on page 45. \u00ceEat foods and drink liquids at room temperature , neither too hot nor too cold. 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237)16 Ways to manage eating problems \u00ceAvoid foods or drinks that can make diarrhea worse . Examples include foods high in fiber, such as whole wheat breads and pasta drinks that have a lot of sugar, such as regular soda and fruit punch very hot or very cold drinks greasy, fatty, or fried foods, such as french fries and hamburgers foods and drinks that can cause gas, such as cooked dried beans and raw fruits and vegetables milk products, unless they are low-lactose or lactose-free beer, wine, and other types of alcohol spicy foods, such as pepper, hot sauce, salsa, and chili foods or drinks with caffeine, such as regular coffee, tea, some sodas, and chocolate sugar-free products that are sweetened with xylitol or sorbitol, which are found mostly in sugar-free gums and candy apple juice, since it is high in sorbitol \u00ce Drink only clear liquids for 12 to 14 hours after a bout of diarrhea . Doing so allows your bowels to rest and helps replace lost fluids. Other ways to manage \u00ceTalk with a dietitian . They can help you choose foods to prevent dehydration. The dietitian can also tell you which foods are good to eat and which ones to avoid when you have diarrhea. \u00ce Be gentle when wiping yourself after a bowel movement . Instead of toilet paper, clean yourself with wet wipes or squirt water from a spray bottle. Tell your doctor or nurse if your rectal area is sore or bleeds or if you have hemorrhoids. \u00ce Tell your doctor if you have had diarrhea for more than 24 hours . They also need to know if you have pain and cramping. Y our doctor may prescribe medicine to help control these problems. Y ou may also need IV fluids to replace lost water and nutrients. This means you will receive the fluids through a needle inserted into a vein. Do not take medicine for diarrhea without first asking your doctor or nurse. www.cancer.gov 17 Dry mouth What it is Dry mouth occurs when you have less saliva than you used to. Having less saliva can make it harder to talk, chew, and swallow food. Dry mouth can also change the way food tastes. Why it happens Chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the head or neck area can damage the glands that make saliva. Immunotherapy and some medicines can also cause dry mouth. Ways to manage with food \u00ceSip water throughout the day . This can help moisten your mouth, which can help you swallow and talk. Many people carry water bottles with them. \u00ceEat and drink very sweet or tart foods and drinks (such as lemonade) . Tart foods and drinks help you make more saliva. But if you have a sore mouth or throat, avoid tart foods and drinks as they might make these problems worse. \u00ce Chew gum or suck on hard candy, frozen fruit, popsicles, and ice chips . These help make saliva, which moistens your mouth. Choose sugar-free gum or candy since too much sugar can cause cavities in your teeth. If you also have diarrhea, check with your dietitian before using sugar-free products as some sweeteners can make it worse. \u00ce Eat foods that are easy to swallow . Try pureed cooked foods or soups. Y ou can find a list of foods and drinks that are easy to chew and swallow on page 47. \u00ceMoisten food with sauce, gravy, or salad dressing to make it easier to swallow. Other ways to manage \u00ceTalk with a dietitian . A dietitian can tell you about ways to eat even when a dry mouth makes it hard for you to chew. \u00ceKeep your lips moist with lip balm . 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237)18 Ways to manage eating problems \u00ceSleep with a humidifier at night. \u00ceRinse your mouth every 1 to 2 hours with a saltwater rinse. There are many recipes for such a rinse, but an example would be to mix 1/4 teaspoon baking soda and 1/8 teaspoon salt with 1 cup warm water. Then, rinse with plain water. \u00ce Avoid drinking alcohol, including beer and wine, as alcohol can make your mouth even drier foods that can hurt your mouth, such as very spicy, sour, salty, hard, or crunchy foods mouthwash that contains alcohol tobacco products secondhand smoke \u00ce Talk with your doctor or dentist .
