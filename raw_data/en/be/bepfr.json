There has been specific interest and consideration in children with autism and neurodevelopmental disorders. Study: Single center prospective provider study (compared to a retrospective group of patients under 18 who received oral midazolam for indications of agitation or anxiety via chart review) looking at patients 6 months to 18 years of age with an order for intranasal dexmedetomidine. Following use, a provider survey was completed to evaluate indication/rationale for use, satisfaction, comfort with use, and perceived time to onset as well as duration of effect. Results: 29% of patients receiving IN dexmedetomidine experienced treatment failure compared with 20.7% of patients receiving oral midazolam (not statistically significant). In subgroup analysis, rates of treatment failure were lower for patients diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder receiving IN dexmedetomidine versus oral versed (21.2% versus 66.7%). Length of stay was longer in the IN dexmedetomidine group (6.0 hours versus 4.4 hours). Indication for use had variability between the two groups. Bottom Line: IN dexmedetomidine may be a reasonable agent to utilize for anxiolysis in pediatric patients, especially those who have previously had paradoxical reactions or poor efficacy of benzodiazepines. It may be specifically useful when effects are desired for a slightly longer time and for non-painful/minimally painful interventions.

The recently published CAPE COD study by Dequin et al. may change the game. Design: Double-blind, 200mg/day x 4-8 days depending on improvement, then preset taper Primary outcome: Death at 28 days Secondary outcomes: Bottom Line: The addition of hydrocortisone to antibiotics in severe CAP may decrease need for intubation and development of shock, and in this well-done study, decreased 28 and 90-day mortality.

They looked at 157 patients and found 61% of assailants were acquaintances, 22% strangers, and 15% intimate partners. One third of all patients had some traumatic injury however only 12 patients has serious injuries such as non-fatal strangulation or a fracture. Assault by an intimate partner was more likely to lead to injury/trauma including non-fatal strangulation. Drug and alcohol use was not associated with presence of injury.

Up to 30% of patients with myasthenia gravis will experience a myasthenic crisis during their disease course. If rapid sequence intubation is indicated, the unique characteristics of this patient population must be considered in the event use of a paralytic is necessary. All paralytic agents can be expected to last significantly longer, and an unpredictable response may be seen with depolarizing agents - therefore non-depolarizing agents are preferred in this population.

But as we increasingly question heavy handed fluid strategies in other areas such as sepsis, should we look at pancreatitis management too? Li et al did a systematic review of the literature on aggressive fluid resuscitation (the exact protocol/definition varied per study, but we're mostly talking 15-20 mL/kg boluses followed by 3-5 mL/kg/hr infusion) vs less aggressive fluid resuscitation (mostly 10 mL/kg boluses followed by 1.5 mL/kg/hr infusion). They found that aggressive resuscitation worsened mortality in severe pancreatitis (RR 2.45) and trended towards worse mortality in non-severe pancreatitis (RR 2.26, but CI crossed 1). Aggressive was associated with more complications in both severe and non-severe pancreatitis pancreatitis. Multiple society guidelines still call for aggressive IVF resuscitation for acute pancreatitis, but probably need to be updated given mounting evidence that this is harmful. More recent guidelines suggest \"goal-directed therapy\", but no one is completely sure what that means. Bottom Line: In acute pancreatitis, a more conservative empiric IVF resuscitation is probably better than the clasically taught aggressive approach. Whether even less fluids would be better or worse is not known, but for now it's probably best to stick to a 10 mL/kg bolus and 1-2 mL/kg/hr infusion when ordering fluids for these patients unless you have another indication.

Bottom line: This is a reminder that traumatic brain injury patients do not do well with hypoxia or hypotension even if transient (during intubation, etc.).

Both (patella and the trochlear groove) are lined with articular cartilage at the patellofemoral articulation. [https://www.stvincentsboneandjoint.com.au/images/patellofemoral-joint2.jpg](https://www.stvincentsboneandjoint.com.au/images/patellofemoral-joint2.jpg) Multiple forces act on the patella which affect proper tracking: Proximately, vastus lateralis. Patellofemoral OA can occur when this cartilage starts to wear and can be seen in skyline/sunrise/notch or equivalent views. OA here rarely occurs in isolation (<10%) and is usually part of medial or lateral knee OA. [https://www.stvincentsboneandjoint.com.au/images/patellofemoral-joint3.jpg](https://www.stvincentsboneandjoint.com.au/images/patellofemoral-joint3.jpg) Patellofemoral pain is usually from overuse/training overload or malalignment. Contributors to overuse involve total joint load which may have influence from training volume (total miles), intensity (competitive sports) in addition to BMI (>25) in addition to overall fitness level. Malalignment aka abnormal patellar tracking involves both static (leg length discrepancy, hamstring tightness, etc.) and dynamic components (hip weakness, gluteus medius weakness, excessive foot pronation, etc.). Patients with anterior knee pain should have activity modification, ice, NSAIDs (not steroids) and long-term engagement in physical therapy (>6 months) with a focus on flexibility and strengthening of lower extremity kinetic chain including the vastus medialis, gluteus medius, hip external rotators and core.

These two studies look at using the RABT score to predict the need for mass transfusion. The RABT score is: A 4-point score blunt (0)/penetrating trauma (1), shock index (hr/SBP) 1 (1), pelvic fracture (1) FAST positive (1) With a score >2 predictive of needing MHP. These studies (one in Canadian trauma centers, the other in US trauma centers) validate the use of this score to predict the need for activation of a mass hemorrhage protocol. 1, Prediction of massive transfusion with the Revised Assessment of Bleeding and Transfusion (RABT) score at Canadian level I trauma centers Karan Mathew T.S.

Those with thoracic injury had a 30-day mortality of 11% whereas those without thoracic injury had a 4% 30-day mortality. Patients over age 60 had higher mortality and were more likely to have rib fractures. Those under 60 with thoracic injury were more likely to have thoracic organ injury than rib fracture. Bottom line: Rib fractures were more common over age 60 and there was a higher mortality for those with thoracic vs non-thoracic trauma. Lundin, A., Akram, S.K., Berg, L. et al.

Scand J Trauma Electrocardiographic Changes at the Early Stage of Status Epilepticus: First Insights From the ICTAL Registry. As the song goes: \"the thigh bone is connected to the hip bone, the hip bone is connected to the back bone.\" It turns out that the brain electrical activities are also connected to the heart conduction activities. In a multi-center (23 French ICUs) retrospective analysis of 155 critically ill patients with status epilepticus, ECGs were done within 24 hours of onset of status epilepticus, and were independently reviewed by cardiologists showed abnormalities in 145 (93.5%) of patients. Below is a list of events that occurred more than 10% of events. Abnormal rate (<60 or > 100 beats/min 64 (44%) Negative T-waves 61 (42%) Flattened T-waves 18 (12%) ST elevation 24 (16.6%) ST depression 26 (17.9%) Left axis deviation 22 (15.9%) Discussion: Major ECG abnormalities were not associated with 90-day functional outcome in multivariable logistic regression. The brain-heart axis could be affected by antiseizure medication. For example, phenytoin, lacosamide are sodium channel blockers while benzodiazepines, propofol, barbiturates with their GABAnergic effects will also display cardiac side effects. This current study was not able to tease out whether the cardiac effects were from medication. Therefore, further studies are needed to figure out the cardiac effect for patients with status epilepticus. Chinardet P, Gilles F, Cochet R, Legriel S.

This study adds further evidence that paramedics can use validated algorithms to clinically clear cervical spine injuries without any bad outcomes including spinal cord injuries. EMS medical directors and all of us who interact with EMS providers should be proactive in developing protocols to use cervical immobilization in appropriately selected patients only.

It has previously been taught that administering IV calcium before administering these medications may prevent the hypotension. Previously, this theory was tested for verapamil and found success with reducing hypotension. Only one study has been done exclusively with diltiazem and it found no benefit. In a new multicenter retrospective cohort study of adults in the ED, patients were randomized into two groups: those who received diltiazem alone and those who received calcium with diltiazem for atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter (AF/AFL) with a HR 120 bpm. Patients were excluded if they required electrocardioversion, had other agents prior to diltiazem, incomplete information, were pregnant or incarcerated. The primary outcome was change in SBP 60 minutes (+/-30 minutes) after diltiazem administration. Baseline characteristics: 73 year old, equal male:female, predominantly white patients. 40% had new onset AF/AFL and the initial HR was 140 in both groups. There were 198 patients in the diltiazem group and 56 patients in the combination group. Notably, patients in the combination group had a lower presenting SBP 109 (101-121) vs 123 (114-132) P<0.0001 which matches classical teaching for when to consider calcium use. Additionally, patients in the combination group received a lower diltiazem dose of 10mg vs 15mg in the monotherapy group p=0.004 with both group receiving doses lower than the standard 0.25 mg/kg dosing recommendation. Outcomes: Take Home Point: Administration of IV calcium may not be as beneficial as previously thought to prevent hypotension induced by diltiazem administration. This particular study is confounded by the relatively low doses of diltiazem overall, but utilizing a lower dosing strategy in patients with low SBP is a reasonable safety strategy.

Hook of the hamate fractures are often associated with sports that require a firm hand grip such as baseball, softball, tennis, golf. These sports cause repeated stress against the hamate bone from the gripped sporting equipment. A frequent mechanism is grounding a golf club or from the act of checking a baseball bat swing. On physical exam, the most common finding is focal tenderness over the hook of the hamate. Another test with high sensitivity is a hook of the hamate pull test Place the patient's hand in ulnar deviation and ask patient to flex the DIP joints of the 4th and 5th digits against resistance.

Place patient in ulnar gutter splint and arrange follow up with hand surgery. Overall, this is an uncommon though frequently missed injury. Consider the above mentioned physical exam and imaging recommendations to improve diagnostic accuracy. Given my previous post on APRV (11/6/2022) and while I take issue with many of the author's statements, I wanted to share a very well referenced article with an excellent discussion on the current gaps in the knowledge around APRV and its use. One statement I do agree with is the need for a well-designed and adequately powered trial of this mode in an admittedly difficult-to-study population. Fortunately, this article has an invited rebuttal pending from Dr. Habashi which I am sure will appear in the Educational Pearls in short order. Good luck to the residents on the ITE!
