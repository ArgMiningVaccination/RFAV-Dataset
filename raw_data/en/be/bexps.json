An incredible amount of effort, understanding of nature and plant observation is needed to develop a leadplant philosophy, using both anthroposophic and conventional scientific methods to increase our understanding. We aim to unlock the inner secret of each unique plant, revealing its character and correlation to humans. This connection between nature and people is the key for the plant to become a source of human vitality and balance, so understanding the relationship allows us to harness the plant's potent beauty, balance and health benefits for everyone, through all ages and life stages. Each Weleda product range is carefully selected with a specific skin and hair type in mind, and knowledge of what it needs. In developing the leadplant product, we don't just focus on that one raw material - the entire formula and all the substances in the product contribute to its overall effectiveness. Because of this the whole product, whether it's cream, shampoo or oil, works holistically and has an impact on the whole person - skin, hair, soul and spirit. Genuine effectiveness of every product is verified by recognised test methods on study volunteers.
