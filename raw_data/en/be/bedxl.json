The luxury hotel itself is gorgeous, with a variety of Balinese-style villas and suites set on beautiful grounds with outstanding facilities including a yoga barn, Pilates studio, excellent gym with TRX, boxing and kinesis equipment and a dedicated outdoor aerial yoga studio. The elegant spa... Highs - The resort is only 20 minutes away from the airport, depending on traffic. - Nusa Dua is in its own Bali haven - clean, tranquil and luxurious which is perfect for an away-from-it-all wellness escape. - Classes can be quite intimate and personal as there is no minimum number of participants required per session. - There are no set dates for the retreats, so guests can begin their wellness holiday any day of the week. - The restaurant offers many options and can cater to different types of guests and varying diets. Lows - The area is quiet and secluded, which can feel like a resort bubble. - Nusa Dua is comprised mostly of luxury hotels and lacks options for cultural exploration. - Although there are tons of activities slated at the retreat, the Nusa Dua is much slower paced compared to nearby towns. - The nearby public beach is beautiful, however it can get crowded with plenty of water sports activities.
