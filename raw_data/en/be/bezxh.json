What is Immunity? According to science direct journal - Immunity is a state of resistance of an organism to invading biotic or abiotic pathogens and their harmful effects that prevents the development of infection and maintains organism's integrity by counteracting, neutralizing, and clearing pathogens. [https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/immunity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/immunity) In short immune system is our body system which is responsible to protect us from invading pathogenic microorganisms like bacteria, virus, fungus and cancer. Immunity - the state of protection from infectious disease - has two components 1.a less specific or INNATE and 2. a more specific or ADAPTIVE component. Why to boost immunity? It's known by everyone that prevention is always better than cure. A good immune system can keep you free from many diseases and can make you healthier, happy & work efficient. In recent COVID 19 outbreaks when there are no proven medicines to cure corona virus disease, It is our immunity which will keep you safe as well as good immunity can cure such viral infection by fighting against it. So, good immunity is the key for healthy & happy life. Immunity Ayurveda way- Ayurveda is the science of life which propagates the gifts of nature in maintaining healthy and happy living. Ayurvedic classics mainly focus on preventive care which comes from the following \"Dinacharya\" - daily regimes and \"Ritucharya\" - seasonal regimes to maintain healthy life. Ayurveda is based on its basic concepts & use of plant based medicines. Modern Medicines says that Immunity is the function of some specific body cells, enzymes and immune-modulator chemicals that attack pathogens like bacteria, virus etc. and stop them from creating diseases. This idea of invasion from microorganisms and a biological defense system against it led to invention and use of the range of antibiotics and vaccines within the 20th century. Many developments within the last decade, just like the emergence of auto-immune issues, widespread antibiotic resistance in microbes, and wider understanding of friendly bacteria and its functions, especially inside our gut, have forced us to rethink the unidirectional concept of the immunity. [Ayurvedic](https://g.page/ayurvedictreatmentnashik) classic scripture broadly classifies diseases as Nija and Aganthu. Those diseases which are caused by an imbalance that has originated within one's body which can be mostly prevented from occurring by understanding one's natural tendencies are called as Nija diseases. Aganthu is caused by an external factor, which can include various injuries, both physical and mental trauma, and lack of focused health and hygiene policies within a specific society. Ayurvedic concepts of immunity Immunity is a concept explicated in Ayurvedic books under multiple topics. The foremost important ones are Bala or the concept of strength, Vyadhi Kshamathwa or the concept of resistance to illness development, and Ojas or the concept of supreme resilience. The concept of Bala explains the capability of the system to repair and nourish itself and be effective in disease prevention, whereas Vyadhi Kshamatwa is the capability of the system to fight against the disease-causing pathogens. Here Bala is the product of the balance of body functions, tissues, digestion, and elimination, and the Vyadhikshamatva is the function of our immunity and recovery after invasion of pathogenic organisms. The preventive aspect of our immunity function is majorly associated with our Jatharagni i.e. digestive power or gastrointestinal system. Balanced doshas or bio-energies are essential for resistance to illness. Ojas is directly related to digestion and immunity. Ojas in Ayurveda is final product of physiological transformation happening in our body as a part of tissue nourishment. The seven layers of tissues ie.saptadhatus are nourished one by one and Ojas is a result of properly functioning metabolic pathways. Ojas is only the essence of the food we consume, and a healthy level of Ojas indicates proper tissue nourishment. The function of Ojas isn't just explained as resistance to disease but it's resilience to any kind of unfavorable physical, mental or environmental change which might normally create an imbalance, resulting in disease, but is otherwise addressed effectively because the presence of Ojas. Even though the knowledge and research about microbes came much recently, Ayurvedic classic scriptures do acknowledge the presence of widespread communicable diseases in societies with improper nutritional guidance and lack of sanitation facilities, created by local governing bodies referred to as Janapadaudhwamsa. this idea of a pandemic caused in a community because of common external factor was mentioned within the text of Charaka Samhita in 2nd century AD. Charaka, the author, mentions the important sources of microbe spread as air, water, and land. this is often most relevant in the current era, not simply because of the infections which spread through these means, but the general impact of soil, water and air because of human exploitation, global climate change and excessive usage of antibiotics and other chemicals. Boosting the function of cells of your immune system is very complicated due to different kinds of cells in the immune system which respond to so many different microbes in so many ways. It is known that the body is continually generating immune cells. Certainly, it produces many more lymphocytes than it can possibly use. The extra cells remove themselves through a natural process of cell death called apoptosis \u2014 some before they see any action, some after the battle is won. No one knows how many cells or what the best mix of cells the immune system needs to function at its optimum level.

The influence of mind and emotion on our immunity is being studied since last 40 years and termed as Psychoneuroimmunology.
