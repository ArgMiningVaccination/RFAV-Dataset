Dunlop Daniel Nicol Dunlop was a Scottish entrepreneur and [Theosophist](/en/Theosophy) who later joined [Rudolf Steiner](/en/Rudolf_Steiner)'s [Anthroposophical Society](/w-en/index.php?title=Anthroposophical_Society&action=edit&redlink=1). Contents Early and education Dunlop was born [December 28](/en/December_28), 1868, at Kilmarnock, in the southwestern region of Scotland, in a Quaker family. He married Eleanor Fitzpatrick, and they had a son and two daughters. [[1]](#cite_note-1) Professional career Mr. Dunlop held important posts in the British Electrical and Allied manufacturers' Association (B.E.A.M.A.). He was organizer and first chairman of the World Energy Conferences, which started in Wembley, London in 1924. [[2]](#cite_note-2) The idea was to bring together scientists, engineers, politicians, and others to consider how energy could be best used within the context of the new internationalism following World War I. An executive committee had 23 members, each representing the electrical industry of a country. Germany was included. They considered such issues as interconnectivity, pricing, duties, regulations, and technical issues. [[3]](#cite_note-3) The conferences have continued for over 90 years, now under the name of World Energy Council. Theosophical Society involvement Dunlop joined the [Theosophical Society](/en/Theosophical_Society_(Adyar)) in Dublin and pioneered Summer Schools. [[4]](#cite_note-4) In 1918 he proposed the idea of an annual [Blavatsky Lecture](/en/Blavatsky_Lectures) series, and the Executive Committee of the Theosophical Society in England enthusiastically agreed. [[5]](#cite_note-5) The first lecture was by [Edward L. Gardner](/en/Edward_L._Gardner), and in 1920 Dunlop himself gave the third lecture on the topic [\"Nature Spirits and the Spirits of the Elements\"](http://resources.theosophical.org/pdf/BL_1920_Dunlop_NatureSpirits_and_the_Spirits_of_the_Elements.pdf). [Clara Codd](/en/Clara_Codd) wrote of her experience meeting him in the library of the Theosophical Society in England: Another famous person who often came in was Mr. Daniel Dunlop, the organizer of a world-wide Federation of Electrical Engineers. He was Irish to the core, and had once been part of the famous Theosophical Group in Dublin which had numbered among its adherents [W. B. Yeats]and [George Russell](AE). An ardent devotee of [William Judge]and the youngest of his forty-seven disciples, Mr. Dunlop had followed Judge when the latter broke away from the main Society and founded in America what was known as the [Point Loma Theosophical Society]now resident at Covina, California. He could not get along with Judge's successor, [Mrs. Katherine Tingley], so he returned to [our Society], though later he left us again to join the Anthroposophical Society under the leadership of Rudolf Steiner. That is quite a common practice in the Theosophical Society; so any attracted by the thought, drift in and out. A small proportion can never leave it again; for them it is life and eternity.\" [[6]] and Steiner]in person in 1922. It was the Dutch manager Joseph van Leer who brought them together. They sat at the table together - Rudolf Steiner who spoke no English and Daniel N. Dunlop who spoke no German. Joseph van Leer stepped in as translator but what he didn't see was that Rudolf Steiner took the hand of Daniel Dunlop and held it, under the table, during the whole of the conversation. In 1934, during one of his famous summer schools, Dunlop shared the memory of this with his friend Walter Johannes Stein. He made an even more interesting statement, that Rudolf Steiner on this occasion said to him, 'We are brothers.' Eleanor Merry, also an active member of the early British Anthroposophical Society, worked intensively with Dunlop for the last 14 years of his life during which time he told her that Rudolf Steiner gave him an insight into a former life of his where he, Dunlop, had been a member of the innermost circle of the Order of the Knights Templar.
