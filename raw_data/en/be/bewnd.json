The most important energy-rich molecule produced by mitochondria from the nutrients we ingest is adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Research now tells us that there is a direct interplay between key nutrients and mitochondrial function, including ATP enhancement. ( [12](https://www.clinicalnutritionjournal.com/article/S0261-5614(18)32426-9/fulltext)) Specific micronutrients influence mitochondrial function because they play critical roles in ATP production and energy metabolism. ( [12](https://www.clinicalnutritionjournal.com/article/S0261-5614(18)32426-9/fulltext)) That's why it's so important to ensure there are adequate levels of key nutrients to support mitochondrial health and energy production. In the final part of this three-part series, we focus on several evidence-based nutritional mitochondria supplements for mitochondrial support. Top supplements for mitochondrial function When [diet](https://fullscript.com/blog/health-benefits-of-nutritional-diets) alone does not provide all of the nutrients we need, dietary supplements may be necessary to maintain optimal health. This is also an effective strategy when it comes to supporting mitochondrial function. There are several supplements to help mitochondria that can be used in addition to a [healthy diet](https://fullscript.com/blog/mitochondria-support-diet) and [healthy lifestyle factors](https://fullscript.com/blog/mitochondria-support-lifestyle). Start using practice 1. Coenzyme Q10 [Coenzyme Q10](https://fullscript.com/blog/coq10) (CoQ10), also known as ubiquinone, is concentrated in the mitochondria. This nutrient is often referred to as the body's \"spark plug\" because it is instrumental to cellular energy production. According to an extensive 2019 review, CoQ10 positively modulates mitochondrial function via these key pathways: - Improves glycemic control via a direct effect on mitochondrial activity; the authors point out that CoQ10 deficiency is common in people with [type 2 diabetes](https://fullscript.com/blog/prevent-type-2-diabetes-naturally)and mitochondrial dysfunction plays a role in the development of diabetes - Modulates mitochondria function by supporting electron transport in the electron-transport chain as well as preventing mitochondrial oxidative damage ( [10](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2019.00532/full)) Another 2017 in vitro study showed that CoQ10 deficiency may be an important indicator of mitochondrial dysfunction. ( [13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5412400/)) Interestingly, in vivo research shows that CoQ10 combined with exercise can help counteract mitochondrial dysfunction. ( [1](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2018/8936251/)) There is no question that CoQ10 is a potent antioxidant supplement that [Omega-3 fatty acids](https://fullscript.com/blog/dha) are important to health on many levels. Research shows that omega-3 supplementation positively impacts the composition of mitochondrial membranes and promote improvements in adenosine diphosphate [7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3961091/)) Research also fatty acid supplementation can help reverse mitochondrial dysfunction related to specific health conditions that impact [glucose](https://fullscript.com/blog/blood-sugar-support-protocol), [cardiovascular](https://fullscript.com/blog/heart-health-and-nutrition), and [liver](https://fullscript.com/blog/liver-health) functions. ( [11](https://academic.oup.com/advances/article/9/3/247/4996109)) 3. Resveratrol Resveratrol is a polyphenol that according to a 2015 review has been shown to improve mitochondrial function and biogenesis (growth and division of mitochondria). ( [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4489008/)) Resveratrol is touted as a key nutrient to [ enhance longevity](https://fullscript.com/blog/longevity-nutrients) and has been shown to exert similar effects on mitochondrial function as a dietary pattern used to help slow the aging process. A 2013 paper that focused on the benefits of [ calorie restriction](https://fullscript.com/blog/calorie-restricted-diet) (CR) for mitochondrial function noted that resveratrol is a compound that can mimic the benefits of CR. They explain that resveratrol positively influences the mitochondrial genetic and enzymatic mechanisms that are similar to those that take place during CR. ( [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3691909/)) Other supplements for mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial health Resveratrol, omega-3 fatty acids, and CoQ10 are just some examples of supplements that can help mitochondria function at peak capacity and reduce the risk of mitochondrial dysfunction. Many other nutrients can benefit mitochondrial function, ( [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4417658/)) [Zinc](https://fullscript.com/blog/zinc)( [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4417658/)) While more human clinical trials are needed to confirm the mitochondrial benefits of some of these nutrients, they all show great promise in supporting mitochondrial function and preventing dysfunction. The bottom line When it comes to supporting mitochondrial health with dietary supplements, research shows that several nutrients may provide benefits, including CoQ10, omega-3 fatty acids, resveratrol, and more. As mitochondria continue to be an important topic to health, we will likely continue to see an increase in the research associated with these targeted mitochondrial supplements.
