We routinely perform blood tests to evaluate organ function, test for infectious diseases, screen for allergies, and measure antibody levels against certain viruses to avoid unnecessary vaccination. Urine is frequently examined as part of a basic health check, not only to rule out infection but also to evaluate overall bladder health and kidney function. We utilize a variety of tests to check skin lesions, sample tumors and cysts, and screen for intestinal parasites. Much of this testing is performed in-house allowing us to provide results within hours or even minutes of sample collection. Biopsies and other more specialized tests are performed for us by outside laboratories. "}
