Come back to this page each day for inspiration related to this week's theme: Spring-Clean Your Spirit. Happy Sunday, Insiders! As the weather starts to warm and the flowers begin to bloom, many of us get the urge to do a bit of spring-cleaning. Perhaps you want to open all your windows to let the fresh air in or do a deep clean of your space. Great ideas\u2014we've been doing it for years! But I'd also like to propose the idea that this new season is the perfect time to focus on spring-cleaning your spirit. Just like clutter can junk up our home and make it feel chaotic, it can do the same to our mind and spirit. When we hold on to ideologies, processes, or patterns that no longer serve us, it is clutter that takes us further away from our true purpose and the road to happiness. I encourage you to spend some time thinking about the things and the people who consume the most of your energy. Ask yourself which of these things feed your spirit and contribute to a more joyful life\u2014and which things don't. One thing I know for sure is that feelings serve as a GPS for your life. When you're supposed to be doing something or not doing something, your emotional guidance system lets you know\u2014you just have to feel it, listen to it. So spend time examining where your spiritual energy is going. If you are doing things in your life that don't feel right\u2014stop doing them. By doing this, you are creating more room for the things that give you energy and lift your spirit. There are some things you'll be able to identify right away as not serving you. What is not serving you now? But others may be trickier. Whenever I have a hard time figuring out what my gut is trying to tell me, I get still. When you do this, you let your internal motivation be the driver, and your personal life will improve-and so will everything else. If it feels right, move forward. If it doesn't feel right, clear out that clutter. When you weed out that which does not serve you and conserve your energy for the things that feed your soul, you'll live a happier, more fulfilled life. And I think that is something that we all strive for. I want to hear what you'll be spring cleaning from the inside out\u2014I love reading your comments! Have a beautiful week!
