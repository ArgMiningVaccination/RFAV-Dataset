Your health relies on a balance of your mind, body and energy systems. Research shows that healthy thoughts support a healthy body and a healthy body requires balanced energy flow throughout. Here at Advantage Integrative Health we believe you cannot treat a person without acknowledging the deeper aspects of healing such as the interplay of belief systems, old injuries (both physical and emotional) and spiritual practices. We offer treatments that encourage this balance such as hypnotherapy, Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), meditation training, The Emotion Code & Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT). We also offer guidance for patients looking to begin or deepen their spiritual practice through meditation. MIND-BODY & ENERGY MEDICINE OPTIONS FOR YOUR HEALING Using your mind and your body's energy system to encourage the natural healing process Any or all of the following techniques can be included in regular treatment of any illness. A proper mental framework sets the stage for healing regardless of the treatment modality. Here at Advantage Integrative Health these treatments are encouraged as adjuncts to your traditional medical care (ie lab work, lifestyle modification, nutrition, medication, etc.). Dr. Bohlmann personally uses these techniques when seeking to attain a new level of health and well-being and he has seen countless patients and coaching clients make enormous leaps of accomplishment by applying them during their effort to do just about anything (not just health related). Meditation Observe and calm your mind Meditation has been part of spiritual practice for many, many years. Only recently has medical science (which requires proof through study) come to awareness that meditation is actually good for your health. Observing the activity of the mind and quieting any over-activity in regular meditation practice can make profound changes in your life. Dr. Bohlmann has been practicing meditation personally for many years and has been witness to the profound effects that a regular practice offers. He is happy and excited to share his experience with you. Hypnotherapy and NLP Focus the power of your mind The amazing power of the mind is still being explored by neuroscientists and spiritual seekers around the globe. How consciousness affects are lives still is unclear; however, it has been suggested that the mind is the builder of our realities. Therefore it is imperative that we set our minds on the reality we desire and hypnosis or neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) are two powerful yet fun ways to accomplish this.There are many ways to use our minds to heal our lives and we at Advantage Integrative Health feel that it is critical to incorporate some form of mind-body balancing technique in each of our treatment plans. Dr. Bohlmann has done extensive study in this area of healing and has used hypnosis and NLP to help empower his patients in their healing journey. Applied Kinesiology Balance your whole system through muscle testing and treatment Applied kinesiology was created by Dr. George Goodheart, Jr. in 1964 and developed the technique throughout his life. It is a complex system that uses muscle testing to uncover imbalances in the body and to quickly correct them. As a patient, the experience of feeling the palpable changes in muscle balance that occurs during treatment is often an exciting inroad to healing.

Dr. Bohlmann is trained in Applied Kinesiology and uses it freely in practice as needed to help you resolve your health concerns in a natural and timely way. The Body Code Uncover and remove energy blocks that keep you sick The Body Code is a proprietary program developed by chiropractor Dr. Bradley Nelson author of The Emotion Code book. The practitioner uses kinesiology (muscle testing) to highlight imbalances in the energy system of the body bringing these imbalances to the conscious mind to be healed. It is a powerful tool when used by a medical expert such as Dr. Bohlmann who understands the importance of energy balance and is open-minded enough to allow the experience to support traditional healing modalities. If you are already familiar with this mode of healing and/or wish to have a session apart from traditional medical care, just download and fill out this simple consent form then schedule your appointment. Sessions can be done in person or via Skype as per your preference.

Through reframing and acceptance of our current state of life and by sequentially activating specific points on the acupuncture meridians, the EFT practitioner seeks to reprogram unhealthy mental patterns that are inhibiting full recovery and thereby activating the body's own healing power. It is a powerful tool and can be used on any concern you might have. If you are interested, just ask Dr. Bohlmann at your next appointment and he'll be glad to help you get started.

Seeking understanding of life through correct movement (asana), study of philosophy (yoga sutras) and calming the mind (meditation) should be part of any yogic practice. Such seeking can bring about awareness of our interconnectedness with all of life and lead to ultimate healing through compassion for all living things. Dr. Bohlmann has been studying yogic science for many years and uses these learnings to help inform the recovery process "}
