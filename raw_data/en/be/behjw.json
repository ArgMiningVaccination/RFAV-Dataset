This means that these products are not under Emergency Use Authorisation but have a full registration. Covovax Vaccine Covovax is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 12 years of age and older. Covovax is administered intramuscularly as a course of two doses of 0,5 ml each. It is recommended to administer the second dose three weeks after the first dose. It is also recommended that individuals who receive a first dose of Covovax, complete the vaccination course with Covovax. This authorisation is based on acceptable safety, quality and efficacy data submitted by Cipla (Pty) Ltd to SAHPRA as a rolling submission. The authorisation is, however, subject to a number of conditions which includes that the vaccine is supplied and administered in accordance with the National COVID-19 vaccination programme and applicable guidelines. Further conditions relate to the reporting of the results of ongoing studies and conformance with pharmacovigilance activities as outlined in the approved risk management plan, including the submission of periodic safety updates. The adverse effects of the Covovax vaccine, as outlined in the clinical trial evidence submitted by the applicant, were usually mild or moderate and cleared within a few days of vaccination. Very common adverse events reported were injection site pain, injection site tenderness, fatigue, malaise headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and nausea. Very rare cases of decreased appetite, diarrhoea, chills, dizziness and somnolence have been observed following vaccination with Covovax.
