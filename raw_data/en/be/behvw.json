But the field of astrology is much deeper, and can even offer us a unique path to healing. Astrology has been used as part of Chinese medicine for thousands of years. Let's explore how astrology plays a role in wellness, and how you can use it to support your holistic self-care practices. Chinese Astrology Meets Chinese Medicine Chinese astrology is based on a twelve-year cycle, and each year is represented by an animal sign (we are currently in the [Year of the Rabbit](https://pinkmoon.co/blogs/news/new-years-self-care-resolutions-for-your-chinese-zodiac-element)!). Each animal sign has its own set of personality traits and characteristics, which may influence the way you see and approach life. Additionally, [Chinese astrology also considers the five elements ](https://pinkmoon.co/blogs/news/new-year-s-resolutions-to-embrace-your-zodiac-element)(wood, fire, earth, metal, and water), which can further influence how we respond to the world around us - both physically and mentally. The combination of your animal sign and element can provide insight into their strengths, weaknesses, and overall life path. When it comes to healing, understanding your element and animal sign can help you tailor your treatments or self-care practices to support your weaknesses and enhance your strengths. For instance, if you were born in a fire year and feeling restless or aggravated, you may consider calming water-based practices (like baths or the [Once in a Pink Moon Water Element Collection](https://pinkmoon.co/products/once-in-a-pink-moon-water-element-collection-hydrating)) to balance your core element.

Some Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners specialize in using astrological analysis to guide you on your unique healing path, based on a much more advanced, complex Chinese astrological reading. What About Western Astrology? Chinese and Western astrology have their differences, but they can complement each other when used together. By combining these two systems, you can gain a deeper understanding of your character and life path. The Western style is based on a twelve-month cycle, with each month being represented by a zodiac sign. Western astrology also considers the positions of the sun, moon, and planets at the time of a person's birth, which further influences their destiny. While Chinese astrology assigns zodiacs by year and Western astrology assigns them by month, there are some cross-overs in personality and health traits. Astrologers believe that [Jupiter](https://www.astrologyanswers.com/planets/jupiter/) is responsible for the connecting link. It takes Jupiter twelve years to go through the Western Zodiac and it spends about one year in each sign. This is how each Western zodiac connects to each Eastern zodiac signs: - Rat = Sagittarius - Ox = Capricorn - Tiger = Aquarius - Rabbit = Pisces - Dragon = Aries - Snake = Taurus - Horse = Gemini - Goat = Cancer - Monkey = Leo - Rooster = Virgo - Dog = Libra - Pig = Scorpio Once in a Pink Moon: Where Eastern Medicine & Western Astrology Meet Our [Once in a Pink Moon line](https://pinkmoon.co/collections/once-in-a-pink-moon) is a celebration of astrology, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and the uniqueness of you.
