Celebrating 50,000 vaccine doses given at the SuperVax vaccine clinic on Amazon's Seattle campus Amazon and Virginia Mason Franciscan Health are celebrating a milestone in COVID-19 vaccinations. On April 24, the 50,000th vaccine dose was administered at the SuperVax vaccine clinic at the Amazon Meeting Center in Seattle. In addition to the clinic in Seattle, Amazon has collaborated with Arlington County Health and JBG Smith on a clinic at its HQ2 location in Arlington, Virginia. Since March 29, more than 14,000 doses have been administered at this location. Amazon has also been providing surge support to the Washington State Department of Health's 2-1-1 call center amid a spike in COVID-19 questions. The center was overloaded with wait times of up to an hour and a backlog of 4,500 voicemails until a new system using Amazon volunteers and Amazon Connect technology was launched in March. The center has since processed over 100,000 calls. The center also eliminated wait times by immediately connecting callers to a response system that uses the same natural language-understanding technology that powers Alexa. April 20 Alexa can help customers access information about COVID-19 vaccines and connect them to vaccination sites As vaccine eligibility opens up nationally, Alexa can help customers find and connect with nearby vaccination sites. Customers can just ask, \"Alexa, where can I get a COVID vaccine?\" or say, \"Alexa, where can I get a COVID vaccine in Seattle?\" to hear a list of locations close to you. Additionally, customers can say, \"Alexa, call the first one,\" (or second, or third location) to connect to a specific location directly and learn more about vaccine or appointment availability.

We wanted to share our thinking and provide an update beyond the June 30 guidance we've provided to date. Our plan is to return to an office-centric culture as our baseline. We believe it enables us to invent, collaborate, and learn together most effectively. The timelines for returning to the office will vary by country, depending on the infection and vaccination rates, and we expect our return to the office to be gradual. In many parts of Asia, our employees are already back in the office. In the U.S., as vaccines become broadly available in the next few months, we expect more people will start coming into the office through the summer, with most back in the office by early fall. In some countries in Europe, we expect in-person working to take longer given recent setbacks. As we get closer to the summer, we'll develop more country-specific plans and post all updates to Inside Amazon under Local News. As a reminder, Amazon offices remain open and about 10% of our corporate population currently works from an office each day. Restaurants, cafes, and shops in our buildings are planning to re-open soon as well. As always, we maintain strong safety protocols, such as temperature screenings upon entry, physical distancing guidelines, face covering requirements, office occupancy limits, and enhanced cleaning in all offices. As we transition back to the office, please continue to follow health authority and local government guidelines. The health and safety of our employees is and has been our top priority as we've thought about how and where people should work during the pandemic. Over the past year, teams have done incredible work under difficult circumstances, and we've learned a lot about the pros and cons of remote work. We look forward to the day in the not-too-distant future when we can again invent together\u2014safely and in person\u2014on behalf of customers. March 25 Amazon begins on-site COVID-19 vaccinations for front-line employees Amazon is rolling out on-site COVID-19 vaccination events for front-line employees, starting in Missouri, Nevada, and Kansas.

July 12 Amazon Web Services helps customers developing COVID-19 test result notification systems Several AWS customers are working on ways to reduce the spread of COVID-19 by developing systems that can instantly notify patients of their test results and monitor how the virus is spreading. In New South Wales (NSW), Australia, NSW Health Pathology developed an SMS (text message) solution that reduced wait times for negative test results from 7 days to within hours of a patient taking a test. By automating this process, NSW Health Pathology has saved the equivalent of three years' worth of time\u2014the time individually contacting tens of thousands of people with their negative test results would have taken. New Zealand's Orion Health, which develops software to improve healthcare outcomes for more than 100 million patients, developed a pandemic monitoring platform to help providers identify and curate lists of patients\u2014both COVID-19 negative and positive\u2014who would benefit from active monitoring or care and tracking their ongoing progress. Improving the COVID-19 patient experience COVID-19 patients are often cut off from visitors, making it challenging to keep family members up-to-date on the health of their loved ones and leaving patients feeling isolated. AWS customers have stepped in to offer solutions, EASE Applications sends HIPAA-compliant text updates to families from the emergency room, operating room, intensive care unit, and medical floor. During the COVID-19 crisis, the company is using Amazon Chime SDK to incorporate two-way video communication into its mobile apps so that families of COVID-19 patients have reliable, remote communication with the patients and their doctors. CareMonitor, a provider of remote health monitoring, expanded its platform to monitor the daily health status of COVID-19 patients with low-level symptoms so they can recover from the virus in their own homes. In the CareMonitor app, patients are asked daily symptom questions and collect biometric data like temperature, heart rate and oxygen saturation to gauge their current health status. The app is integrated with Amazon Chime, a set of real-time communications components, to send messages and connect via video to health care providers. Current Health is enabling more than 40 hospitals and care facilities in the UK and U.S. to free up beds, applying its remote monitoring technology to track patients' vital signs outside of the hospital or clinic. Using a medical device that patients wear on their arms, clinicians can continuously monitor patients who are at risk of deteriorating, enabling them to perform triage and consult with patients over video. The Seoul National University Hospital in South Korea built a system on AWS to remotely monitor mild and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, enabling the medical team to determine if patients under quarantine need to be transferred to other hospitals for treatment.
