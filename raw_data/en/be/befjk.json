Vaccines offer a promising treatment for OUD and potentially the prevention of fatal overdoses. The Oxy(Gly)4-sKLH Conjugate Vaccine, Adsorbed (Oxy(Gly)4-sKLH) has shown promising pre-clinical efficacy at reducing the behavioral and pharmacological effects of oxycodone. To support its clinical evaluation, a GLP toxicology study was performed to address the safety of Oxy(Gly)4-sKLH. Sprague Dawley rats were vaccinated with either aluminum adjuvant (alum) or vaccine adsorbed on alum. Low and high doses of Oxy(Gly)4-sKLH, equivalent to a 1X or 47X human dose, respectively, were administered every two weeks for a total of four vaccinations. Both vaccine doses induced high antibody titers. Vaccine-related toxicity was assessed postmortem in one experimental group after receiving the fourth immunization of the vaccine's high dose. For the remaining experimental groups, rats were challenged with 1.5 mg/kg/day s.c. oxycodone for 7 days after the fourth vaccination to assess whether concurrent exposure to oxycodone in vaccinated animals resulted in toxicity. All rats, except a subset of the aluminum control and the high dose vaccine groups, were sacrificed following oxycodone exposure. These subsets were allowed a four weeks recovery period prior to euthanasia. In this study, no Oxy(Gly)4-sKLH-related hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, body weight, organ weight, or anatomic pathology toxicological findings were observed. These results demonstrate that the Oxy(Gly)4-sKLH vaccine is well tolerated, is immunogenic even at low doses, and does not produce undesired side effects in work was supported by the National Institutes of Health National Institute on Drug Abuse [Grants U01DA038876 (M.P. and P.R.P and UG3DA047711 (M.P.)].
