The [COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html) virus is scary because it's incredibly contagious and the side effects, especially for those with underlying health conditions, can be dire. But while much of the advice I give my worried patients is what you will read elsewhere,I have several tips you may find unique \u2014 and they could make all the difference for you and your loved ones. What's different about our perspective? Start by remembering the wise final words of the 19th Century scientist Louis Pasteur: The pathogen is nothing, the terrain is everything. Pasteur spent a lifetime studying germ theory (the word germ just means any infectious agent that causes illness), along with inventing the pasteurization process. His words are a powerful reminder that we absolutely can take steps to create the right\"terrain\" \u2014 in our surroundings and within our own bodies \u2014to protect ourselves from any pathogen, including Covid19. Want to join me in taking a \"terrain is everything\" approach to avoiding COVID-19? Here are some practices I recommend. 1. Clean & disinfect: Keep the outside of you clean Germs breach your immune system chiefly by you ingesting an infectious dose through your nose, mouth or eyes. You can get this by being coughed on by an infected individual,or through hand-to-face contact after you touch a surface that contains the germs. Washing your hands So to minimize the risk of infection, avoid both those situations, and get in the habit of frequent hand washing. You don't need antibacterial soap or anything high tech or overly harsh. Here are some tips on how to wash your hands effectively: - Using plain old soap and water works \u2014 and works well \u2014 because the lipids (fats) in soap effectively \"dissolve\" the glue that holds the COVID-19 virus together, breaking the virus apart and washing it away. - Go about your hand washing by thinking like a surgeon: Get under your nails, wash up to your elbows, and keep scrubbing for longer than you normally would. The [CDC recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html)20 seconds of hand washing using warm or cold water. To help you time yourself, here's a tip: Sing the complete refrain to Prince's Raspberry Beret, which lasts exactly 20 seconds! (If that's not in your repertoire, sing the Happy Birthday song twice.) Wash your hands more frequently than you normally would. - Don't worry about using very hot water. The temperature of the water has no impact on the effectiveness of hand washing. It's the soap that will kill the virus; the water is there to simply help you lather up and wash it away. You may find that using cooler water actually protects your skin from getting too dry or cracking. (Cracked skin breaches your first line of immune defense!) Carry a bottle of 70% alcohol hand sanitizer with you for those times when soap and water are unavailable. Disinfecting surfaces Also recognize all the other dirty things you come in contact with \u2014 avoid them or clean them. COVID-19 can last 8 days on surfaces like your cell phone, doorknobs, public toilets, escalator rails, cash and coins, and light switches. If your hands are not clean and you touch your keyboard or reading light, they're now risky too. Here are my suggestions for cleaning and trying avoid high-touch surfaces: - For those things that can't be dunked in soapy water, wipe them down with an alcohol-based cleaner (70% alcohol). Disinfect your phone often. Only use it for calls if you absolutely must when you are out and about (and touching so many germs things); save the Instagramming for when you are home and can have a clean phone and clean hands. - Because we all come in contact with so many surfaces during a typical day, you want to avoid touching your face, eyes and nose unless you have just thoroughly washed your hands. You may not realize how often you touch your face until you try not to! You can turn this into a mindfulness practice by noticing that you want to touch your face and then focus on your breathing until the urge passes. 2. Nutrition & supplements: Keep the inside of you \"clean\" too Eating or drinking too much sugar can dampen your immune function, putting your white blood cells into a sort of \"coma\" as researchers describe it.You want your immune system to be ready for action, so if you need motivation to finally kick sugary foods to the curb, this is it. Here's how to give your immune system even more support: Eat more fruits and vegetables: - Go for a wide variety of brightly colored fruits and vegetables which are rich in antioxidant vitamins A, C and E. These include berries, citrus fruits, apples, red grapes, kale, onions, spinach, sweet potatoes, and carrots. - Another favorite food is garlic, which contains natural compounds that help fight viruses and bacteria. - Some mushroom varieties \u2014 such as shiitake \u2014 also help strengthen immune function. Add immune-boosting supplements: Sometimes our diets just can't give us the amount of nutrients we need, or nutrients may not be readily available from common foods, so supplements are a great option. For immune support, here are some supplements that I find to be very effective: - Vitamin C (taken to bowel tolerance) [Vitamin D](https://shop.womenshealthnetwork.com/products/vitamin-d) - Fish oil for the omega-3s - Anti-inflammatory curcumin - Vitamin K2 - Vitamin A - Elderberry - Zinc - Selenium (Eating 2-3 Brazil nuts daily can supply most of the selenium you need.) It's always best to work with a naturopathic physician to understand how much supplementation you require, especially for vitamin A. This approach gives general immune support; be wary of claims that specific supplements fight off COVID-19 -the science on that isn't settled yet. You can give your immune system even more support by taking a probiotic \u2014 checkout our [Super Biotic](https://shop.womenshealthnetwork.com/products/super-biotic-probiotic) supplement which promotes digestive health and immune support.As studies have shown, gut bacteria play an important role in the development of white blood cells that help the body's immune system fight off pathogens; the more good bacteria you have, the stronger your immune system. Stay hydrated too as that keeps all your systems in better working order. 3. Social distancing: Avoid crowds and needless contact Viruses mutate quickly when there are lots of cases. If we can limit cases of coronavirus,we'll see fewer mutations, and the virus will be easier to contain. We can do our job by avoiding crowds, especially in enclosed spaces. Do your shopping at off-peak times because greater distance from other persons reduces the risk of infection.If you cough or sneeze, do so into your elbow or a tissue. Avoid shaking hands or using cash. Stay home when you are sick. And [wear a mask](/other-womens-health/make-your-cloth-face-mask-more-effective/). In established models of infection risk, the main benefit of wearing a mask/face covering is to prevent a sick person from infecting others. In more recent tests, there appears to be a smaller but important benefit for well persons to wear masks to reduce their risks of being infected by others. That's why the CDC recommends everyone wear a mask when near other people, or in crowded and/or confined spaces. However, please remember that the mask is not a shield: your best protection is to avoid the \"Three C's\": contact with persons outside your household, crowds, and confinement. During these times of social distancing and self-isolation, try to see the cup as half full, not half empty. Think of it as a self-imposed self-care retreat. Clean out that closet, finish that scrapbook, write that novel, watch yoga videos on Youtube and do everything you need to take good care of yourself. Give yourself permission to embrace this time of slowness, stillness and rest. 4. Manage stress: Turn off the TV and give the terrain of your mind some self-care Being in a chronic state of stress is proven to suppress immune function, so give yourself extra self care and try not to worry too much. Yes, you do need [up-to-date information about COVID-19,](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) but keeping the TV on 24/7 or being glued to the internet all day is only going to keep you stressed.Here are some ideas that you could try: - Give yourself a few \"virus update\" times during the day where you watch or read the news to get the latest, then go on with your day. - Take time to meditate and do some deep breathing to relax. - Prioritize getting enough sleep. If coronavirus worries are keeping you up at night or your days are plagued with anxious thoughts, your [adrenal glands](/adrenal-fatigue-and-stress/)are probably in overdrive and may need [added support.](https://shop.womenshealthnetwork.com/collections/adrenal-stress-and-fatigue) Is the pandemic really just a needless panic? Even doctors may disagree about this. My view is that this virus is much more dangerous than the usual flu. That's for five main reasons: - The gestation period for the infection is unusually long. In infected people, it can take 14 days for symptoms to appear versus just a few days for the flu. - About 80% of cases are mild and easily confused with a cold. This plus the long gestation period mean that infected people can expose hundreds of people to the germs without being aware at all. - The virus lingers in the air and on surfaces longer than the flu. This means that infected people who cough or sneeze are spreading the germs further than we are accustomed to. - Although the data is still emerging, it appears that the mortality rate among vulnerable groups \u2014 the elderly and those who are immune-impaired \u2014 is much higher than for the flu. We may also find that the rate of serious complications, like organ damage, is higher. - The coronavirus family is highly mutagenic. This means it could easily mutate into a more dangerous form. The fewer cases there are, the less likely that is to happen soon. As the days go by and more and more cases of coronavirus inevitably spread across the globe, I want us all to take better care of ourselves and each other. Staying home and avoiding infection will help do that and give other benefits too, not just now but over the long term. And I can't help but see this pandemic as a much-needed wake up call that our health simply must come first. If there is a \"terrain\"that is worth tending, we are it. Take care and be well. We'll get through this together. | ||Shop for Immune Support|| | Your Satisfaction Is 100% Guaranteed "}
