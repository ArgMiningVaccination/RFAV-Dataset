Our founder, Ellen Browning Scripps, was one of the most thoughtful community philanthropists of her time. But Miss Ellen, as she was known, preferred the term \"investment\" over \"donation.\" Her contributions to the community were carefully considered as much for their future promise as for immediate impact. Mother Mary Michael Cummings founded Scripps Mercy Hospital even earlier, as a one room dispensary in 1890. Her detailed patient logs illustrate her fundamental mission to make quality health care available to all who need it. Both of these remarkable women\u2014ahead of their time\u2014helped to create the fabric of Scripps and the community we call home. The 16,000 employees, physicians and volunteers of Scripps Health are proud of this history and the work they do each day to keep this spirit alive. The pages that follow provide a comprehensive account on how we do that: our community benefit programs and services and our plans for continued action. In 2009, Scripps community benefit services contributions totaled $311,023,544. This includes $255,584,160 in uncompensated care, $39,226,597 in professional education and health research, $538,576 in community building activities and $15,674,213 in community health services. In 2010, severe economic conditions continue to affect all sectors and organizations, including health care. Despite this, Scripps continues to fully take on the challenge of meeting the health care needs of our community, including the growing number of individuals and families without the ability to pay for these critical services. Scripps is a private, not-for-profit health care system making a vital and measurable difference in the health of the San Diego region. This is an integral part of our mission \u2014 a promise set into motion eight decades ago, but every bit a part of who we are today. Chris Van Gorder, FACHE President and CEO our mission Scripps strives to provide superior health services in a caring environment and to make a positive, measurable difference in the health of individuals in the communities we serve. We devote our resources to delivering quality, safe, cost effective, socially responsible health care services. We advance clinical research, community health education, education of physicians and health care professionals and sponsor graduate medical education. We collaborate with others to deliver the continuum of care that improves the health of our community. our Values We provide the highest quality of service - Scripps is committed to putting the patient first and quality is our passion. In the new world of health care, we want to anticipate the cause of illness and encourage healthy behavior for all that rely on us for service. We teach and encourage patients to participate in their care and to make well-informed decisions. We will be their advocates when they are most vulnerable. We measure our success by our patients' satisfaction, their return to health and well being, and our compassionate care for dying patients, their families and friends. We demonstrate complete respect for the rights of every individual - Scripps honors the dignity of all persons, we show this by our actions toward one another and those we serve. We embrace the diversity that allows us to draw on the talents of one another. We respect and honor the cultural, ethnic and religious beliefs and practices of our patients in a manner consistent with the highest standard of care. All this is done in a compassionate setting. Our goal is to create a healing environment in partnership with all caregivers committed to serving our patients. We care for our patients every day in a responsible and efficient manner - Scripps serves as a major community health care resource for San Diego County and, as such, we are accountable for the human, financial and ecological resources entrusted to our care as we promote healing and wholeness. We begin from a base of excellence and collaborate with co-workers, physicians, patients, and other providers to find new and creative ways to improve the delivery of health care services. All members of our community will have access to timely, affordable and appropriate care.our Vision Scripps Health will be the premier health care system recognized for delivering compassionate, unparalleled patient care through clinical quality, advanced technology, research and innovation.Founded in 1924 by philanthropist Ellen Browning Scripps, Scripps Health is a $2.2 billion, private not-for-profit community health system in San Diego, California. Scripps treats 2.1 million patients annually through the dedication of 2,900 affiliated physicians and 13,000 employees among its five acute-care hospital campuses, home health care, and an ambulatory care network of clinics, physician offices and outpatient centers throughout the San Diego region. Scripps is a recognized leader in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease and is at the forefront of clinical research and graduate medical education.

Stapleton General Manager, San Diego County Water AuthorityTable of Contents Section 1 System Summary: Fulfilling benefit programs and services during Fiscal Year 2009. 1System Summary Section 1Fulfilling the Scripps Mission This report was developed in response to Senate Bill 697. Passed in 1994, the bill requires California's community, not-for-profit hospitals to annually describe and document the full range of community benefits they provide. Scripps has taken this legislative requirement a step further. This report incorporates not only documentation of community benefits, but also a more detailed explanation of the specific community benefit activities provided on our five acute-care hospital campuses, through home health care, our wellness centers and clinics. The report details programs and services that provide benefit to the community over and above standard practices of care. It is categorized into three primary areas: Uncompensated Health Care Community Health Services Professional Education and Health Research The report covers the period of Oct. 2008 through Sept. 2009 (Fiscal Year 2009). During this fiscal year, Scripps devoted $311,023,545 to community benefit programs and services in the three above areas (see figures 1:1 and 1:2). Our programs emphasize community-based prevention efforts and use innovative approaches to reach residents at greatest risk for health problems. Definitions of terms used in this report can be found within Appendix A. The documentation and activities described in this report are commitments we make in order to improve the health of our patients and our San Diego communities. As a long-standing member of these communities, and as a not-for-profit community resource, our goal and responsibility are to provide help and assistance for all who come to us for care, and to reach out especially to those who find themselves vulnerable and without support. This responsibility is an intrinsic part of our mission. Through our continued actions and community partnerships, we strive to raise the quality of life in the community as a whole.2Community Benefit is defined as programs or activities that provide treatment or promote health and healing in response to an identified community need. Community Benefit programs must meet at least one of the following criteria: Respond to a public health need Involve education or research that improves overall community health Responds to needs of special populations Supply services or programs that would likely be discontinued if the decision was made on a purely financial basis because they operate at a financial loss. Schedule H (Form 990) Hospitals with tax-exempt status are now required to provide information specific to their organization on the new Schedule H of the recently redesigned Form 990 (the annual information return filed by tax-exempt organizations). The IRS released a draft version in June 2007 and, after seeking public comment on the draft, issued the final version in December 2007. The Schedule H is available at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f990sh.pdf. For tax year 2008, the only portion of Schedule H that was required was the disclosure and description of the hospital facilities operated by the filing entity. The entire Schedule H is mandatory beginning with tax year 2009.1 Schedule H contains six parts. Part I requests details about a hospital's charity care program and quantifies charity care expenditures. Part II quantifies the hospital's community building activities. Part III quantifies the cost due to Medicare shortfalls and bad debts owed to the organization. Part IV requires disclosure of any joint ventures in which a hospital participates. Part V requests information about the entity's health care facilities. Part VI provides an area in which to discuss, in a narrative fashion, other charitable activities that may be difficult to quantify. (See Appendix A for a definition of terms). Scripps has aligned its 2010 Community Benefit Plan and Report to the new Schedule H categories. According to the IRS, Community Building Activities, Bad Debt and Medicare Shortfalls are reported but not included in the community benefit totals. (See page 14 for a breakdown of Scripps System Uncompensated Care Summary for FY09). 1 Congressional Research Service, November 19, 2009. www.crsdocuments.com3Community Benefit Services: Community benefit services include those programs and services offered to the community that go above and beyond what is provided as a normal part of patient care. Scripps categorizes community benefit services in three categories, including uncompensated health care, community health services, and professional education and health research. Uncompensated care includes charity care, bad debt, Medi-Cal and Other Means Tested Government Programs and Medicare Shortfalls.FIGURE 1:1 FY09 Scripps Total Community Benefit Services Distribution, $311,023,545 Community Building Activities $538,576 0% Medicare & Medicare HMO $146,475,561 47%Charity Care Programs $51,334,580 17%Bad Debt $16,247,687 5%Professional Education Services $15,674,213 5%4FIGURE 1:2 FY09 Scripps Total Community Benefit Services by Operating Unit, $311,023,545 Scripps Medical Foundation $69,594,615 22% Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego & Mercy Clinic $78,231,924 25%Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla $58,967,114 0% Scripps System Wide $22,159,310 7% Community Benefit Services: Community benefit services include those programs and services offered to the community that go above and beyond what is provided as a normal part of patient care.

Identifying San Diego County's health priorities is a complex process outlined in the following pages. Scripps strives to improve community health through collaboration. Working with other health systems, community groups, government agencies, businesses and grassroots movements, we are better able to build upon existing assets to achieve broad community health goals. Community Health Improvement Partners Scripps is an official partner and an active participant in Community Health Improvement Partners (CHIP). Through CHIP, more than 25 community health-related organizations come together to jointly address the county's health needs. Scripps works with CHIP and other health care systems and partners to develop a comprehensive county health needs assessment which is updated every three years, including county, state and national health statistic comparisons. The collaborative assessment process is one of the most respected in California. To gain a full understanding of Scripps' health assessment and analysis of community need in San Diego, we recommend reviewing the CHIP 2007 \"Charting the Course V\" San Diego County Needs Assessment at http://www.sdchip.org. 2007 Priority-Setting Process A group of 48 CHIP members and guests, representing a broad cross-section of San Diego County health experts, participated in scoring 14 previously identified key health issues faced in San Diego County. The group scored health issues using the following criteria: Size: Incidence and/or prevalence and number of persons affected Seriousness: Level of severity as indicated by case fatality rate, years of productive life lost, economic and/or social impact Community Concern: Level of concern as evidenced by the results of the seven focus groups and surveyors' knowledge of the issues. 7The priority setting process helped identify 14 key San Diego County health issues: 2 Access to health care services Arthritis, osteoporosis, and chronic back conditions Oral health Substance abuse Infectious diseases Diabetes Nutrition and obesity, physical activity and fitness Heart disease and stroke Maternal and child health Injury and violence prevention Chronic respiratory diseases Mental health and mental disorders Cancer Tobacco use Scoring of these health issues by CHIP members and San Diego County health experts resulted in the findings represented in Figures 2:1-2:2. Each health issue was scored separately for each of four age categories. Results are presented both by the three criteria and overall. Additionally, overall results are presented for each age category. Community Need Index (CNI) The Community Need Index (CNI) is a standardized tool developed by Catholic Healthcare West, San Francisco, to help identify barriers to care (CHW 2005). The index is based on five socioeconomic indicators known to contribute significantly to health differences in the community: Income Culture/language Education Housing status Medical insurance coverage Scoring each postal zip code from 1 (low need) to 5 (high need) based on these indicators, assessment results indicate slightly more than 9 percent of San Diego County's 97 studied zip code areas have a CNI score between 4.5 and 5.0, with the majority of high-need areas located in the Central San Diego region. 2 Community Health Improvement Partners (CHIP).

Geographically dispersed over 4,300 square miles, they represent multiple ethnic groups. The San Diego Association of Government's (SANDAG) population growth projections are just over 1 percent per year, extending out 25 years to the year 2030. The North Central region is the most populated (19.5 percent of total). The county population is 28 percent Hispanic, 9.9 percent Asian and 5.3 percent Black. The county population of those 0-19 years old is 28.5 percent, while 11 percent is 65 years of age or older. Scripps serves a quarter of the total county population, concentrating services in the North Coastal, North Central, Central and South regions of San Diego County where Scripps facilities are located (Appendices D and E).9FIGURE 2:1 Top Health Issues for San Diego County - By Scoring Criteria Overall3 Rank Size Serious Community Concern Overall 1 Overweight & Obesity Overweight & Obesity Access to Care Overweight & Obesity 2 Access to Care Access to Care Overweight & Obesity Access to Care 3 Diabetes Mental Health Cancer Diabetes 4 Mental Health Diabetes Diabetes Heart & Stroke 5 Heart & Stroke Substance Abuse Injury & Violence Injury & Violence 6 Cancer Heart & Stroke Heart & Stroke Mental Health 7 Injury & Violence Injury & Violence Substance Abuse Cancer 8Chronic Respiratory Disease Cancer Chronic Respiratory Disease Substance Abuse 9 Substance Abuse Tobacco Use Tobacco Use Tobacco Use 10 Infectious Disease Chronic Respiratory Disease Maternal Health Chronic Respiratory Disease 11 Maternal Health Infectious Disease Infectious Disease Infectious Disease 12 Oral Health Oral Health Mental Health Maternal Health 13 Tobacco Use Maternal Health Oral Health Oral Health 14 Arthritis Arthritis Arthritis Arthritis 3 Community Health Improvement Partners (CHIP).

During FY09, Scripps contributed $255,584,160 in uncompensated health care including $41,526,333 in charity care, $197,810,141 in Medi-Cal and Other Means Tested Government Programs and Medicare shortfall and $16,247,687 in bad debt. Scripps provides hospital services to one quarter of the county's uninsured patient population. Of this, Scripps Mercy Hospital (including the San Diego and Chula Vista campuses) provides 66 percent of the charity care from within the Scripps system (refer to figure 3:4) . County Overview According to a 2006 San Diego County Healthcare Safety Net Study, nearly one-third of San Diego County's population (909,661) is uninsured or underinsured, with the highest concentration - half of the total - south of interstate 8. The hospitals and community clinics that provide health care to this population are the safety net. The health care safety net in San Diego County is highly dependent upon hospitals and community health clinics to provide care to uninsured and medically underserved populations. Finding more effective ways to coordinate and enhance the current safety net is a critical policy challenge. While public subsidies (e.g., County Medical Services) help finance services for San Diego County's uninsured populations, these subsidies do not cover the full cost of care. Combined with Medi- Cal and Medicare funding shortfalls, Scripps and other local hospitals are left to absorb the cost involved in caring for the uninsured in their operating budgets. The financial burden placed on hospitals and physicians to care for uninsured patients is significant. 13According to a December 2008 UCLA Health Policy Research Brief, nearly 6.4 million Californians were without any health insurance coverage for all or some of 2007. This number represents 19.5 percent of all Californians under age 65. While the percentage of uninsured has remained high but relatively steady for the last four to five years it is widely believed that the current economic condition is causing the number of uninsured to once again increase. The number of uninsured patients is the single biggest pressure point on hospitals. In 2008, California hospitals provided $11.3 billion in uncompensated care. Of that amount, Medicare shortfalls accounted for nearly $3.7 billion, while Medi-Cal underfunded hospitals by $4 billion.7 Financial Assistance Assisting Low-Income, Uninsured Patients The Scripps financial assistance policy is consistent with the AB774 \"Fair Pricing Policy\" legislation. The practices established reflect our commitment with respect to assisting low-income, uninsured patients with discounted hospital charges, charity care, billing and debt collection practices. Our program is provided without regard to race, ethnicity, gender, religion or national origin. Scripps provides full financial assistance to low-income and uninsured patients earning less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level guidelines. For individuals who qualify between 201-400 percent of the poverty level, financial assistance is based on a discount schedule. For 2009, Health and Human Services defined the 400 percent Federal Poverty Level of a family of four as $88,200. 6 California Health Interview Survey. \"Source: 2007 California Health Interview Survey,\" www.chis.ucla.edu 7 A report On Californian Hospitals and the Economy, January 2009, California Hospital Association (November 2008 Survey)San Diego has experienced a brief improvement in the number of insured residents from 2003 to 2007 (refer to figure 3:1) .

These programs are designed to raise public awareness, understanding of and access to identified community health needs (Refer to page 4). Scripps categorizes Community Health Services according to the new Schedule H 990 categories mandated by the IRS. It is categorized into five main areas: (Refer to the Scripps Community Health Services Activity Summary for a breakdown of categories, page 32). Community health improvement services Community benefit operations Cash and in-kind contributions Subsidized health services Community building activities During FY09 (October 2008 to September 2009), Scripps invested $15,674,213 in community health services. This figure reflects the cost associated with providing such activities, including salaries, materials and supplies, minus revenue. Following are highlights of just some of the activities conducted by Scripps during FY09. Refer to figure 4:1 for a graphical representation of the FY09 Scripps System Community Health Services program distribution. Access to Care A lack of health insurance and access to specialty and primary care providers are two of the primary barriers to health care on both a local and national level. Without access to basic health care services, individuals suffer from more acute episodes of illness, injury and mortality. It is also an increased burden on hospitals and health providers resulting from providing uncompensated care to the uninsured.14 In an effort to provide for populations in need, Scripps assisted in FY09 with the following health care programs and projects. Mercy Outreach Surgical Team (MOST) - The Mercy Outreach Surgical Team (MOST) works to mitigate the effects physical deformities have on children by providing reconstructive 14 Community Health Improvement Partners (CHIP). Charting the Course V 2007: A San Diego County Health Needs Assessment. Retrieved from the World Wide Web: http://www.sdchip.org22 surgeries at no cost to children in need. In special circumstances, surgeries also are provided for adults. During FY09, the MOST team provided reconstructive surgeries for more than 400 children and 431 procedures were done. (Sponsored by Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego and affiliated physicians). St. Vincent de Paul Village Medical Center and Mid-City Community Clinics - Weekly community clinics were held at the St. Vincent de Paul and Mid-City Community Clinics. Staffed by the Scripps Green Hospital and Scripps Clinic Internal Medicine Residents, these clinics provided medical care to approximately 600 of our county's most vulnerable residents during FY09. Scripps Health Community Benefit (CB) Fund - In 2009, Scripps awarded a total of $100,000 in community grants to programs based throughout San Diego. Scripps awarded six grants ranging from $10,000 to $40,000 each. The projects that received funding address some of San Diego County's high-priority health needs with the goal of improving access to vital health care services for a variety of at-risk populations, including the homeless, economically disadvantaged, mentally ill and others. Since the Community Benefit Fund began, Scripps has awarded $1.7 million dollars. Programs funded during FY09 include: CB Fund - Catholic Charities - Funding awarded to provide short-term emergency shelter to medically fragile homeless patients being discharged from Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego. Case management and shelter is provided for previously homeless patients discharged from Scripps Mercy Hospital who no longer require hospital care but do need a short-term supportive recuperative environment. Patients demonstrating a readiness for change are assisted with one week in a hotel along with food and bus fare to pursue case plan. The focus of the case management is to stabilize the client by helping them connect to more permanent sources of income, housing and ongoing supports for efforts toward self-reliance. The goal of this partnership is to reduce the incidence of ER recidivism in this population and improve the quality of life for the patient. CB Fund - La Maestra Community Health Center - La Maestra Community Health Center received $15,000 to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate oral health services to the underserved, uninsured and underinsured students at Hoover High School, its feeder schools and their families. CB Fund - 2-1-1 New Access System - Funding was awarded for ongoing operations of its telephone dialing code, which provides the public with information about community, health and disaster services. 2-1-1 San Diego is the dialing code for information about community, health and disaster services. It connects people with resources over the phone, online and in print. Locally, 2-1-1 San Diego was launched in June 2005 as a multilingual and confidential service committed to providing access 24/7.23 CB Fund - Partnership for Smoke-Free Families - The Partnership for Smoke- Free Families Program (PSF) is a comprehensive tobacco control program to reduce tobacco smoke exposure among pregnant women and small children by systematically screening pregnant women and new parents for tobacco use in their obstetrician's and pediatrician's office and linking them with tailored interventions. PSF has become a standard of care in San Diego County and a nationally recognized model. PSF provides a valuable resource for physicians and smoking cessation services specifically for pregnant women and new parents that was previously non-existent in San Diego. CB Fund - American Cancer Society - Funding was awarded to the American Cancer Society for the San Diego Discovery Gala. The mission of the American Cancer Society is to eliminate cancer as a major health risk through research, advocacy, education and patient services. CB Fund - American Heart Association - Funding awarded for the 2009 Heart Walk sponsorship. Heart disease and stroke are the number one and number three causes of death in the nation for men and women. Heart disease is the nation's leading cause of death, claiming more than 950,000 American lives each year. Scripps partners with the American Heart Association on their annual Heart Walk, to raise funds for research, professional and public education and advocacy. CB Fund - Fiji Alliance Project - In partnership with the International Relief Teams of San Diego, the Loloma Foundation, Scripps employees, Scripps Clinic physicians and other Scripps affiliated physicians provided medical and surgical services in Fiji to persons in need. Residents from Scripps Clinic and Scripps Green Hospital have an opportunity to participate in the medical missions as one of their rotations. Examples of procedures include cleft lip and palate repairs, repairs of deformities of eyelids, face and feet, burn scar revision, breast masses, diabetes management and hernia repairs. All surgical supplies were donated by Professional Hospital Supply Corp. (PHS), the supplier for Scripps Health system. The supplies included surgical gowns, gloves, drapes, dressings, bandages, sutures, etc. Cardinal Health Systems, which provides pharmaceuticals and other supplies to Scripps Health, donated all the medications necessary. In FY09, a clinical team of 14 practitioners provided care to 4,500 patients in just two weeks. ( Sponsored by Scripps Clinic/Green Hospital)24Cancer/Oncology Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the U.S. exceeded only by heart disease and accounts for almost one quarter of all deaths in San Diego County. During 2007, an estimated 559,650 will die as a result of cancer, making it the second leading cause of death in the United States.15 In response to this serious health concern, Scripps has developed a series of prevention and wellness programs designed to educate people on the importance of early detection and treatment for some of the most common forms of cancer. During FY09, Scripps engaged in the following cancer control activities. Breast and Cervical Cancer Cancer Control - Scripps Breast Cancer Diagnosis Project (Scripps Project) - Provides free diagnostic imaging services to low-income, medically uninsured or underinsured women age 39 and younger, and men of any age, who reside in San Diego and present with a breast mass or abnormality. This project is funded by Susan G. Komen for the Cure, San Diego and the Scripps Cancer Center. In FY09, 425 qualified community members participated in the program, 294 received diagnostic mammograms, 379 received breast ultrasounds and 57 received biopsies. Three cancer cases were detected. (Initiative led by Scripps Cancer Center) Cancer Center - Community Education - In FY09, cancer early detection outreach and marketing activities provided to community-based organizations and businesses reached 75,146 community members through broad-based outreach and 10,774 through individual encounters. Community education activities include breast cancer, cervical cancer, skin cancer, colorectal cancer and prostate cancer. (Initiative led by Scripps Cancer Center) Cancer Detection Programs: Every Woman Counts - This is a state of California grant program that provides free breast and cervical cancer tailored health education to low- income, uninsured and underinsured women who reside in San Diego and Imperial Counties. In addition, Scripps Health provides clinical administrative oversight over 75 community-based clinics that are contracted with the state to provide free breast cancer screenings for women age 40 and older and cervical cancer screenings for women age 25 and older. During FY09, the following outcomes were achieved: Education - Breast and cervical cancer early detection and prevention education was provided to 515 qualifying women. 15 Community Health Improvement Partners (CHIP).

Retrieved from the World Wide Web: http://www.sdchip.org.25 The Scripps Women in Action Breast Health Outreach and Education program - This program reached 14,000 underserved women with breast health education, improving awareness of early breast cancer detection services. In addition, more than 10,000 underserved women received access to breast health screening and mammographies. (Led by Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista Community Benefit Services) Cardiovascular Disease Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke are the number one and number three causes of death in the nation for both men and women. Heart disease is our nation's leading cause of death, claiming more than 950,000 American lives every year. Stroke is America's third killer and is a leading cause of serious, long-term disability. Diseases of the heart are the leading cause of death in San Diego for both men and women. In 2004, the age-adjusted rate for disease of the heart for the total San Diego County population was 187.2 deaths per 100,000 population.16 During FY09, Scripps engaged in the following heart health cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment activities. American Heart Walk - Scripps allocated $10,000 in operational funds and $30,000 in in-kind donations to support the American Heart Association's efforts to fight heart disease and stroke. In addition, the ScrippsAssists employee volunteer program coordinated walker participation and fund raising efforts. The San Diego Heart Walk exceeded its goal by raising more than $1 million. In 2009, more than 2,400 Scripps Heart Walk participants - employees, families and friends - walked to help raise more than $155,000. Additionally, Scripps reached out to the community at the event by providing blood pressure screenings, health education materials and more. Heart Health Education Efforts Increased public awareness about the risks of heart disease in women, offering an education symposium targeting middle-aged women Offered Cardiac Program for the community-at-large focusing on current care options and new screening technologies available for heart health. Offered four cardiac screenings checking blood pressure and body fat at health fairs located throughout San Diego County.

Charting the Course V 2007: A San Diego County Health Needs Assessment. Retrieved from the World Wide Web: http://www.sdchip.org.26Diabetes More than 90 million Americans (33 percent) live with a chronic disease. While there are many disabling chronic diseases, diabetes has been identified as one of the primary chronic conditions in San Diego County. As the sixth leading cause of death in America, diabetes was responsible for 3.1 percent (74,817) of deaths in 2005. More than 6 million Americans are unaware that they have diabetes. The complications related to diabetes are serious and can be reduced with preventive practices. Diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in San Diego County, accounting for 529 deaths. Leading to school and work absenteeism, an elevated rate of hospitalization, frequent emergency room visits, permanent physical disabilities and sometimes death, diabetes is a serious community health problem.17 During FY09, Scripps engaged in the following diabetes management initiatives. Project Dulce - Formed through collaboration between The Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute, the Council of Community Clinics, and Community Health Improvement Partners (CHIP). Project Dulce is a comprehensive, culturally competent diabetes management program for underserved and uninsured populations in San Diego County. Project Dulce incorporates the Chronic Care Model in its team-based approach to care. Project Dulce has been working in communities across San Diego for the past 10 years by providing diabetes care and self management education. Nurse-led teams focus on achieving measurable improvements in the health of their patients; nurse educators lead multidisciplinary teams that provide clinical management; and peer educators from each cultural group, known as promotoras, provide public and patient education to their perspective communities. This innovative program combines the state-of-the-art in clinical diabetes management with proven educational and behavioral interventions. During FY09 Project Dulce engaged in the following: Provided 14,283 diabetes care and education visits for low-income and underserved individuals throughout San Diego. Trained physicians, nurses and health educators throughout the community clinic system on hypertension and diabetes care. Enrolled more than 2,000 new patients in Project Dulce. Expanded services to an additional six clinic sites. Published the results of our depression care project, IMPACT + Project Dulce, in the medical journal, Diabetes Care. Presented findings of the depression project to the annual meeting of the American Public Health Association. Initiated three new programs: 1) Diabetes Prevention for Women with a History of Gestational Diabetes; 2) Replicating Project Dulce in Tijuana; and 3) Diabetes Peer Care 17 Community Health Improvement Partners (CHIP). Charting the Course V 2007: A San Diego County Health Needs Assessment. Retrieved from the World Wide Web: http://www.sdchip.org.27Coordination Project at Scripps Mercy Chula Vista Hospital. Trained health professionals in Tijuana, Tennessee and New Jersey. Provided the community with 55 series of eight week courses led by peer educators. Moe than 650 participants in 15 sites were reached through 880 hours of instruction Held 28 support group meetings for 142 participants. Participated in seven health fairs reaching more than 300 people. Health Behaviors Understanding that personal behaviors play a significant role in an individual's overall health status, Scripps has developed a series of prevention and wellness programs that help people take charge of their own health and that of their families. During FY09, Scripps participated in a number of health behavior modification efforts. Flu Vaccination Campaign - Accounting for more than 36,000 deaths in the U.S. annually, pneumonia and influenza are a serious health concern for high-risk populations. In an effort to minimize the number of persons that contract pneumonia and influenza, Scripps is committed to ensuring high-risk populations have access to flu vaccinations regardless of their ability to pay. In partnership with the County of San Diego and the Community Health Improvement Partners (CHIP), Scripps administered more than 2,000 doses* of the flu vaccination to high-risk populations throughout San Diego County in FY09. *Note: Represents vaccinations provided through community outreach efforts and does not include vaccine provided to patients being treated within Scripps hospitals or receiving care from a Scripps affiliated physician. (Vaccine provided by Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla Pharmacy and the San Diego Health and Human Services Agency. Scripps' participation led by Scripps Memorial Hospital Encinitas, Community Benefit Services with additional support provided by Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla, Community Benefit Services) Maternal Child Health Education Programs for Low-Income Women - Continued to enhance prenatal education offerings for low-income women in San Diego County: Offered a total of 165 Child Birth Preparation classes through San Diego County designed to enhance the parenting skills. Low-income women in the County of San Diego were eligible to attend all classes at no charge or on a sliding fee scale. Maintained the existing prenatal education services in all the regions of the County ensuring that programs continued to demonstrate a greater than 90 percent satisfaction rating. Provided and supported five weekly Breastfeeding Support Groups throughout San Diego County including two with bilingual services. 28 Offered the following maternal child health classes at the Mende Well Being Center: Basic Training for Dads, breastfeeding classes, child birth preparation classes, Getting Ready for the Baby, The Infant CPR and Safety program, Parent Connection programs, Redirecting Children's Behavior and sibling classes. (Operated by Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla, Community Benefit Services) Nutrition Services - According to the 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), more than 61 percent of Americans ages 18 years or older are overweight (36.5 percent) or obese (25.1 percent). Obesity increases the health risk for chronic diseases, such as heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke and some forms of cancer. At even greater risk are the nation's low-income minority populations. In an effort to address this critical health concern, staff members based at the City Heights Wellness Center have established a variety of nutrition education and counseling services, designed specifically to meet the needs of low-income minority populations. During FY09, more than 3,000 people accessed nutrition education and counseling services at the City Heights Wellness Center. (Initiative led by Scripps Mercy Hospital, Community Benefit Services) Substance Abuse Substance abuse has a major impact on individuals, their families, and their communities. The effects of substance abuse are cumulative, contributing to costly social, physical, mental and public health problems. These problems include teenage pregnancy, HIV/AIDS, other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), domestic violence, child abuse, motor vehicle crashes, physical fights, crime, homicide and suicide.18 In an effort to encourage more people to take steps to prevent substance abuse, Scripps engaged in the following activities: Every 15 Minutes - Alcohol can be attributed to more than 100,000 deaths in the U.S. annually, including 41 percent of all traffic fatalities.19 The Every 15 Minutes program is a two-day event that exposes high school students to the consequences of drinking and driving through a dramatic reenactment of an alcohol-related traffic accident. The \"injured\" students are taken to Scripps Mercy Trauma Center and Scripps La Jolla Trauma Center. This program is sponsored jointly by local high schools, county police, sheriffs, CHP, emergency departments and ambulance services. During FY09, Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla reached more than 300 high school students and Scripps Mercy Hospital participated in three Every 15 Minutes programs, reaching more than 3,000 high school students in San Diego County's East and Central regions.

While the prevalence of smoking in the United States has declined 49 percent since 1965, an estimated 371 billion cigarettes were consumed in the U.S. during 2006. Cigarette smoking causes heart disease, several kinds of cancer (lung, larynx, esophagus, pharynx, mouth and bladder and chronic lung disease. In 2005, the estimated direct medical costs related to smoking in the U.S. were $75.5 billion and productivity costs were $92 billion. Second-hand smoke is clearly a community health risk atrributing to low birth weight in newborns, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), respiratory infections, asthma and middle-ear disease in infants and children. The Partnership for Smoke-Free Families (PSF) is a collaborative effort supported by Scripps, Sharp Healthcare and Children's Hospital focused on improving the health and well being of children by reducing their exposure to second-hand smoke. The Partnership for Smoke-Free Families Program has become a standard of care in San Diego County and a nationally recognized model for systematically screening and linking pregnant women and their families with small children exposed to tobacco smoke with interventions. As of October 2009, more than 262,000 pregnant mothers and parents of young children have been screened for tobacco use/exposure and nearly 51,000 proactively linked to targeted interventions. (Funded by Scripps Health System, Community Benefit Services) Youthful Drinking and Driving Program - Considering that at least 74.3 percent of high school students in the U.S. report drinking alcohol, it is imperative that students understand the risks associated with alcohol abuse. In an effort to educate at-risk students about the dangers associated with drinking and driving, Scripps Mercy Hospital's Emergency Department and Trauma Center participated in the Corrective Behavior Institute's Youthful Drinking and Driving Program, providing 96 teens with a trauma center visitation experience. This four- hour supervised trauma visitation program for young drivers ages 14 and over to show them the realistic consequences of driving under the influence. Participants visit the trauma room, ER, ICU, CAT scan and other hospital areas. (Led by Scripps Mercy Hospital's Emergency Department and Trauma Center) 30Fostering Volunteerism Scripps believes that health improvement begins when community members take an active role in making a positive impact on their community. For this reason, Scripps supports volunteer programs for Scripps employees and affiliated physicians who want to help make even more of a difference in the health of their community. The ScrippsAssists employee volunteer club is one avenue through which Scripps matches the talents and interests of employees and physicians with community needs. This includes, but is not limited to, mentoring partnerships with local schools and efforts to provide free medical and surgical care to patients in need. In addition to the financial community benefit contributions made during FY09, Scripps employees and affiliated physicians contributed a significant portion of their personal time volunteering to support Scripps-sponsored community benefit programs and services. With close to 58,093 hours of volunteer time, the estimated dollar value of this volunteer labor is $2,418,783.20 This amount is not included in Scripps' FY09 community benefit programs and services total. 20 Calculation based upon an average hourly wage for the Scripps Health system plus benefits.31FIGURE 4:1 FY09 Scripps Community Health Services by Operating Unit, $15,674,213 Community Health Services: Includes prevention and wellness programs as well as other community health improvement services (screenings, health education, support groups and health fairs) supported by operational funds, grants and in-kind donations. Calculations based on cost less direct offsetting revenue. Direct offsetting revenue includes any revenue generated by the activity or program, such as payment or reimbursement for services provided to program patients. Direct offsetting revenue does not include restricted or unrestricted grants or contributions that the organization uses to provide community benefits. Community Health Services' expenses have increased substantially beginning in FY08 as Scripps does not offset for grants or contributions.

Without the ability to train and inspire a new generation of health care providers or to offer continuing education to existing health care professionals, the quality of health care would be greatly diminished. Medical research also plays an important role in improving the community's overall health through the development of new and innovative treatment options. Each year, Scripps allocates resources to the advancement of health care services through clinical research and medical education programs. During FY09 (October 2008 to September 2009), Scripps invested $39,226,59721 in professional training programs and clinical research to enhance service delivery and treatment practices for San Diego County. This section highlights some of our professional education and health research activities.

Nevertheless, the service is provided because it meets an identified community need and if no longer offered, it would either be unavailable in the area or fall to the responsibility of government or another not-for-profit organization to provide. Subsidized services do not include ancillary services that support lines, such as lab and radiology (if these services are provided to low-income persons, they are reported as charity care/financial assistance). The total expense for subsidized health services for FY09 was $7,932,071 . This includes Scripps inpatient and outpatient behavioral health services, Mercy Clinic and Scripps In-Lieu of Funds. Scripps offers both inpatient and outpatient adult behavioral health services at the Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego campus. Scripps Mercy's Behavioral Health program also actively supports community programs designed to reduce the stigma of mental illness and help affected individuals live and work in the community. Behavioral Health Inpatient Programs Individuals suffering from acute psychiatric disorders are sometimes unable to live independently or may even pose a danger to themselves or others. In such cases, hospitalization may be the most appropriate alternative. Scripps Mercy Hospital's Behavioral Health Inpatient Program helps patients and their loved ones work through short-term crises, manage mental illness and resume their daily lives. Challenges Like many behavioral health programs across the country, funding is difficult, as payment rates have not kept pace with the cost to provide care. In 2009, Scripps Mercy's Behavioral Health Program lost $5.1 million . In 2009, 20 percent of patients in the inpatient unit were uninsured. Behavioral Health Outpatient Programs Scripps Mercy provides community-based adult psychiatric treatment at Scripps Mercy San Diego. The outpatient program is an intensive day program designed to help individuals reduce their symptoms while they continue to live in the community. The program provides two levels of care: The outpatient program offers patients one to four treatment days per week The partial hospitalization program provides more intensive treatment five to six days per week. 76A-Visions Program The innovative A-Visions Vocational Training Program, located at the San Diego campus helps prepare patients for volunteer and employment opportunities by giving them exposure to a variety of work activities and training. The total expense for the A-Visions program for FY09 was $71,000 . Currently, 21 individuals are enrolled: 8 as volunteers and 13 as Scripps Mercy Hospital employees. In-Lieu of Funds: In-Lieu of Funds are used for unfunded or underfunded patients and their post-discharge needs. Funds are used for board and care, skilled nursing facilities, long-term acute care and home health. In addition, funds are used for medications, equipment and transportation service. The total subsidized expense for In-Lieu of Funds during FY09 was $1.4 million . Mercy Clinic of Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego Founded in 1930 and adopted by the Sisters of Mercy in 1961, Mercy Clinic of Scripps Mercy Hospital is a primary care clinic that treats more than 2,000 patients each month. Total patient visits for primary and subspecialty care at the clinic in FY09 were 18,015. Established with the intent of caring for the poor, Mercy Clinic has become a critical source of medical care for San Diego's \"working poor.\" Each year, eighty percent of the patient visits are paid through Medi-Cal, Medicare or some other insurance plan. The remaining 20 percent pay what, and if, they can. Thousands of people in the region rely on Mercy Clinic, most of them women, children and seniors who otherwise would have no other access to health care. The total subsidized expense for Mercy Clinic for FY09 was $1.4 million (excludes Medicare, Medi-Cal, bad debt and charity care). A permanent clinic staff of nurses and other personnel work hand-in-hand with more than 100 physicians from Scripps Mercy Hospital who volunteer their time. As an integral part of treating its patients, Mercy Clinic serves as a training ground for more than 50 residents each year from the Scripps Mercy Hospital Graduate Medical Education Program. Note: Mercy Clinic expenses are included within Scripps Mercy Hospital financials.77FIGURE 8:1 FY09 Scripps Subsidized Health Services Distribution by Category, $7,932,071 Subsidized Health Services: Subsidized Health Services are clinical programs that are provided despite a financial loss so significant that negative margins remain after removing the effect of charity care, bad debt and Medi-Cal shortfalls.

Without the ability to train and inspire a new generation of health care providers or to offer continuing education to existing health care professionals, the quality of health care would be greatly diminished. Medical research also plays an important role in improving the community's overall health through the development of new and innovative treatment options. Each year, Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego and Mercy Clinic allocate resources to the advancement of health care services through clinical research and medical education programs. To enhance service delivery and treatment practices for San Diego County, Scripps Mercy Hospital and Mercy Clinic invested $8,050,29327 in professional training programs and clinical research during FY09 (October 2008 to September 2009).

The Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute Making A Financial Commitment During FY09, The Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute devoted $1,466,072 to community benefit programs and services, including uncompensated health care, community-based health improvement activities, and professional education and clinical research. The programs offered by SWDI emphasize community-based prevention efforts and use innovative approaches to reach residents at greatest risk for health problems. According to a UCLA Health Policy Research Brief, the number of people diagnosed with diabetes in San Diego County is more than 130,000 as of August 2007. Approximately 1.7 million Californians have been diagnosed with diabetes, and an additional 600,000 Californians are undiagnosed. Diabetes leads to school and work absenteeism, an elevated rate of hospitalization, frequent emergency room visits, permanent physical disabilities, and sometimes death. Diabetes is a serious community health problem.33 Throughout the past 10 years the epidemic of diabetes has permeated every facet of our communities. The percentage of individuals entering hospitals with diabetes is rising; the number of children developing diabetes is growing; and larger numbers of people are experiencing complications of diabetes, such as renal failure and heart disease, at an earlier age. The development of unique, innovative clinical programs and community-based research is urgently needed to combat this epidemic in our communities. 33 Community Health Improvement Partners (CHIP).

Home Health includes the following distinguished programs and services: Cardiovascular Care, Wound Management, Diabetic Care, Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Speech Therapy, Dietary Services and Medical Social Services. Scripps Cancer Center Scripps Cancer Center (SCC) is a system-wide approach to the provision of cancer services across all Scripps hospital campuses and ambulatory care sites. Through SCC, clinicians, scientists and health care professionals with expertise in research, treatment, education and prevention have come together to create a powerful cancer resource in San Diego County. Today, Scripps adds 100 new clinical trials each year at its five hospitals, the Scripps Clinic medical group and Scripps Cancer Center. In addition, there are major contributions from investigator-initiated research projects, some of which have produced new, state-of-the-art medical devices and technologies that are used worldwide. Scripps Cancer Center includes the following distinguished programs and services: Screening Services, Diagnostic Services, Ultrasound and ultrasound-guided breast biopsy, Stereotatic-guided core breast biopsy, Breast needle localization Computed Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Positron emission tomography (PET).127Scripps Clinical Research Center (SCRC) Research and clinical discovery have been part of Scripps Health's mission since its founding in 1924. Today, Scripps adds approximately 100 new clinical trials each year. Clinical Research Services consolidates and expands access to clinical research for physicians and patients across the Scripps system and in all the communities Scripps serves. The research mission is to provide comprehensive, expert support to Scripps physicians and staff so that they may provide patients with access to the best research treatments. In addition, Scripps aligns its research objectives with the ongoing continuing and graduate medical education programs that provide cutting-edge programs to Scripps health care professionals. In 2007, Scripps made substantial investments to establish the Scripps Genomic Medicine program and Scripps Translational Science Institute (STSI). A year later in partnership with The Scripps Research Institute - STSI was selected to receive a National Institutes of Health Clinical Translational Science Award. The five-year, $20 million grant supports research infrastructure and training. In 2008, the Scripps Clinical Research Center was created to support clinical research throughout the Scripps system. Scripps Clinical Research Center has brought together more than 25 medical specialties under one roof. The center is designed to accelerate the delivery of new technologies to patients by bringing together the majority of components needed to initiate and conduct clinical investigation in one seamless, streamlined regulatory and administrative process. Scripps is building on a strong foundation for clinical and translational research encompassing the entire range of clinical investigation - from small pilot studies to large multicenter trials. All Scripps hospitals are engaged in research involving inpatient care. Ambulatory-based research is increasing in all Scripps' clinical settings. Scripps currently supports more than 200 principal investigators and about 350 active clinical research protocols crossing broad interdisciplinary disease categories.

The institute identifies promising opportunities among existing research efforts at both Scripps Health and The Scripps Research Institute to provide seed funding to physician researchers across the Scripps Health system. This funding supports the researcher in preparation for the pursuit of National Institutes of Health grant funding or other associated grants. As part of Scripps Translational Science Institute, the Scripps Genomic Medicine Program supports basic research and clinical programs designed to understand an individual's genetic susceptibility to disease and to forward those findings into drug discovery and clinical trials. Scripps Genomic Medicine , an initiative of Scripps Health in collaboration with The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), will support basic research and clinical programs focused on defining the genes that underlie susceptibility to disease, and take these findings into drug discovery programs and ultimately into clinical trials. The program's work will involve genotyping tens of thousands of individuals of diverse ancestry in an attempt to identify and define genes responsible for major disease and the underpinnings of health. The identification of these genes may lead to drug discovery and gene-specific clinical trials. Current research includes studying women's DNA variants to determine the likelihood of developing breast cancer and using that genetic risk data to guide mammogram frequency. Another study, called the Wellderly Study, looks at the healthy elderly who are 80 years of age or older with no history of chronic diseases to help unlock the genetic secrets behind the lifelong health. The rich diversity of the San Diego population - the primary patient base of the Scripps program - provides unparalleled opportunities for this research. Scripps System Community Benefit Services Scripps System Community Benefit Services provides oversight, support, guidance and coordination of Scripps community health and outreach program initiatives, helping to ensure that they are in accordance with the Scripps mission, values and strategic goals/objectives. This program also supports the Strategic Planning Committee, a committee of the Scripps Board of Trustees, in assessing and planning to meet community need. Additionally, this program is responsible for developing the triennial health needs assessment in collaboration with the Community Health Improvement Partners (CHIP) and through the Community Benefit Fund provides funding to support community programs that address San Diego County's high-priority health needs.129SCRIPPS Sy StEm-WIdE PR oGRAmS And SERVICES 2010 CommUnIty BEnEFIt PLAn FY10 The Scripps System-Wide 2010 Community Benefit Plan provides a description of the overall Scripps community benefit goal and the system-wide objectives and strategies to support community health improvement during Fiscal Year 2010 (October 2009 to September 2010).

Fostering Volunteerism In addition to the financial community benefit contributions made during FY09, Scripps System employees contributed a significant portion of their personal time volunteering to support Scripps- sponsored community benefit programs and services. With 5,116 hours of volunteer time, it is estimated that the dollar value associated with this volunteer labor is $213,011.34 Making A Financial Commitment During FY09, $22,159,310 was devoted by Scripps System-Wide programs to community activities, including uncompensated health care, community health services, and professional education, and health research. The programs offered by Scripps emphasize community-based prevention efforts and use innovative approaches to reach residents at greatest risk for health problems. FY09 Scripps System-Wide Community Benefit Services Highlights During FY09, Scripps System-Wide contributed $22,159,310 to community benefits, including $367,770 in Medi-Cal and Other Means Tested Government Programs, $1,669,800 in community health services, $19,647,761 in professional education and health research, and $473,978 in Community Building Activities. Refer to Figure 13:1 presented on the following page for a graphical representation of the FY09 Scripps System-Wide Community Benefit Services distribution. 34 Calculation based upon an average hourly wage for the Scripps Health system plus benefits.133FIGURE 13:1 FY09 Scripps System-Wide Community Benefit Services Distribution, $22,159,310 Community Benefit Services: Community benefit services include those programs and services offered to the community that go above and beyond what is provided as a normal part of patient care. Scripps categorizes community benefit services in three categories, including uncompensated health care, community health services, and professional education and health research. Uncompensated care includes charity care, bad debt, Medi-Cal and Other Means Tested Government Programs and Medicare Shortfalls.

These programs are designed to raise public awareness, understanding of and access to identified community health needs (refer to Figures 2:1-2:2, pages 9-10). During FY09 (October 2008 to September 2009), $22,159,310 was invested by Scripps System- Wide programs and services in community-based health improvement activities. This figure reflects the cost associated with providing community health improvement activities, including salaries, materials and supplies, minus billable revenue. This section highlights some of the Scripps system- wide FY09 community health services. Scripps Health Community Benefit Fund - In 2009, Scripps awarded a total of $100,000 in community grants to programs based throughout San Diego. Scripps awarded six grants ranging from $10,000 to $40,000 each. The projects that received funding address some of San Diego County's high-priority health needs with the goal of improving access to vital health care services for a variety of at-risk populations, including the homeless, economically disadvantaged, mentally ill and others. Since the Community Benefit Fund began, Scripps has awarded $1.7 million dollars. Programs funded during FY09 include: CB Fund - Catholic Charities - Funding awarded to provide short-term emergency shelter to medically fragile homeless patients being discharged from Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego. Case management and shelter is provided for previously homeless patients discharged from Scripps Mercy Hospital who no longer require hospital care but do need a short-term supportive recuperative environment. Patients demonstrating a readiness for change are assisted with one week in a hotel along with food and bus fare to pursue case plan. The focus of the case management is to stabilize the client by helping them connect to more permanent sources of income, housing and ongoing supports for efforts toward self-reliance. The goal of this partnership is to reduce the incidence of ER recidivism in this population and improve the quality of life for the patient. CB Fund - La Maestra Community Health Center - La Maestra Community Health Center received $15,000 to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate oral health services to the underserved, uninsured and underinsured students at Hoover High School, its feeder schools and their families. 135 CB Fund - 2-1-1 New Access System - Funding was awarded for ongoing operations of its telephone dialing code, which provides the public with information about community, health and disaster services. 2-1-1 San Diego is the dialing code for information about community, health and disaster services. It connects people with resources over the phone, online and in print. Locally, 2-1-1 San Diego was launched in June 2005 as a multilingual and confidential service committed to providing access 24/7. CB Fund - Partnership for Smoke Free-Families - The Partnership for Smoke-Free Families Program (PSF) is a comprehensive tobacco control program to reduce tobacco smoke exposure among pregnant women and small children by systematically screening pregnant women and new parents for tobacco use in their obstetrician's and pediatrician's office and linking them with tailored interventions. PSF has become a standard of care in San Diego County and a nationally recognized model. PSF provides a valuable resource for physicians and smoking cessation services specifically for pregnant women and new parents - previously non-existent in San Diego. CB Fund - American Cancer Society - Funding was awarded to the American Cancer Society for the San Diego Discovery Gala event. The mission of the American Cancer Society is to eliminate cancer as a major health risk through research, advocacy, education and patient services. CB Fund - American Heart Association: Funding awarded for 2009 Heart Walk sponsorship. Heart disease and stroke are the number one and number three causes of death in the nation for men and women. Heart disease is the nation's leading cause of death, claiming more than 950,000 American lives every year. Each year, Scripps partners with the American Heart Association on their annual Heart Walk, to raise funds for research, professional and public education and advocacy. Cancer /Oncology During 2007, 559,650 Americans are expected to die of cancer, making it the second leading cause of death in the U.S.35 In response to this serious health concern, Scripps has developed a series of prevention and wellness programs designed to educate people on the importance of early detection and treatment for some of the most common forms of cancer. During FY08, Scripps engaged in the following cancer control activities. 35 Community Health Improvement Partners (CHIP). Charting the Course V 2007: A San Diego County Health Needs Assessment.

This project is funded by Susan G. Komen for the Cure, San Diego and the Scripps Cancer Center. In FY09, 425 qualified community members participated in the program, 294 received diagnostic mammograms, 379 received breast ultrasounds, and 57 received biopsies and three cases of cancer were detected. (Initiative led by Scripps Cancer Center) Cancer Control - Community Education - In FY09, cancer early detection outreach and education activities provided to community-based organizations and businesses reached 75,146 community members through broad based outreach and 10,774 through individual encounters. Community education activities include breast cancer, cervical cancer, skin cancer, colorectal cancer and prostate cancer. (Initiative led by Scripps Cancer Center) Cancer Detection Programs: Every Woman Counts - This is a state of California grant program that provides free breast and cervical cancer tailored health education to low- income, uninsured and underinsured women who reside in San Diego and Imperial Counties. In addition, Scripps Health provides clinical administrative oversight over 75 community-based clinics that are contracted with the state to provide free breast cancer screenings for women age 40 and older and cervical cancer screenings for women age 25 and older. During FY09 the following outcomes were achieved: Education - Breast and cervical cancer early detection and prevention education was provided to 515 qualifying women. The Scripps Women in Action Breast Health Outreach and Education program - This program reached 14,000 underserved women with breast health education, improving awareness of early breast cancer detection services. In addition, more than 10,000 underserved women received access to breast health screening and mammographies. (Led by Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista Community Benefit Services) Cardiovascular Disease Coronary heart disease and stroke are the number one and number three causes of death in the nation for both men and women. Heart disease is the nation's leading cause of death, claiming more than 950,000 American lives every year. Stroke is America's third killer and is a leading cause 137of serious, long-term disability.36 During FY08, Scripps engaged in the following heart health/ cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment activities. American Heart Walk - Scripps Health allocated $10,000 in operational funds and $30,000 in in-kind expenses to support the American Heart Association's efforts to fight heart disease and stroke. In addition, the ScrippsAssists employee volunteer program coordinates walker participation and fund raising efforts. The San Diego Heart Walk exceeded its goal by raising more than $1 million. In 2009, more than 2,400 Scripps Heart Walk participants - employees, families and friends - walked to help raise more than $155,000. Additionally, Scripps reached out to the community at the event by providing blood pressure screenings, health education materials and much more. Partnership for Smoke-Free Families - Second-hand smoke is clearly a community health risk atrributing to low birth weight in newborns, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), respiratory infections, asthma and middle-ear disease in infants and children. The Partnership for Smoke Free Families (PSF) is a collaborative effort supported by Scripps, Sharp Healthcare, and Children's Hospital and focuses on improving the health and well being of children by reducing their exposure to second-hand smoke. The Partnership for Smoke-Free Families Program has become a standard of care in San Diego County and a nationally recognized model for systematically screening and linking pregnant women and their families with small children exposed to tobacco smoke with interventions. As of October 2009, more than 262,000 pregnant mothers and parents of young children have been screened tobacco use/ exposure and nearly 51,000 proactively linked to targeted interventions. (Funded by Scripps Health System, Community Benefit Services) Emergency/Disaster Preparedness Disaster Preparedness: Community Outreach and Education - Having the ability to provide emergency services to those injured in a local disaster while continuing to care for hospitalized patients is a critical community need. Scripps delegated participation in San Diego County and state of California advisory groups to plan, implement and evaluate key disaster preparedness response plans and funding. Disaster Preparedness: Mobile Field Hospital Exercise - Hospital Administrative Support Unit and Scripps Medical Response Team - Having the ability to provide emergency services to those injured in a state of California disaster while continuing to care for hospitalized patients is a critical community need. To this end, Scripps lead the Mobile Field Hospital State-wide exercise 36 Community Health Improvement Partners (CHIP). Charting the Course V 2007: A San Diego County Health Needs Assessment.

Scripps developed the MFH operations plan and implemented an exercise that included more than 500 medical volunteers. The hospital was open and managed more than 300 patients for four hours in this training event. Disaster Preparedness: H1N1 Vaccine Clinics for the Community - Due to the critical need to vaccinate the community for H1N1 pandemic flu, Scripps collaborated with the San Diego Public Health Department and volunteered to vaccinate all Scripps employee families, all affiliated physicians and volunteers. This support assisted the county of San Diego Public Health to expedite and reach the community with limited supply of vaccine during the pandemic event. During the six weeks, 2,000 family members, 1,000 volunteers and affiliated physicians were vaccinated. Disaster Preparedness: San Diego County and National Community Support and Outreach Education - The goal is to participate in community education locally and nationally as an organizational leader in disaster preparedness and planning. In FY09, participated in the San Diego Business Consortium and led multiple lectures to government and community audiences: Nov 15, 2009 - Canadian College of Health Care Executives - Panelist - Pandemic Flu Planning, Business Continuity and Community Focus Group Oct 19, 2009 - Dept.

(Initiatives led by the Disaster Preparedness program under the direction of the Chief Medical Officer)139Scripps System-Wide FY09 Professional Education and Research Highlights Quality health care is highly dependent upon health education systems and medical research programs. Without the ability to train and inspire a new generation of health care providers or to offer continuing education to existing health care professionals, the quality of health care would be greatly diminished. Each year resources are allocated by Scripps System-Wide programs and services to the advancement of health care services through professional health education programs and research. To enhance service delivery and treatment practices for San Diego County, $19,647,76138 was invested by Scripps System-Wide programs and services in professional training programs and research during FY09 (October 2008 to September 2009). This section highlights some of the Scripps System-Wide professional education and research activities conducted in FY09. SDSU Nurses Now - During FY09, Scripps allocated $125,000 in funding and provided nursing staff (part-time) to act as clinical instructors in the San Diego State University (SDSU) School of Nursing. These resources enabled increased student enrollment (94 students). (Funded by Scripps Health System Operations) Grossmont College, School of Nursing - In an effort to address the current nursing shortage, Scripps provided funding to support the Grossmont College School of Nursing, allowing for additional clinical instructors. The program covers costs associated with clinical instruction thus enabling 30 additional students to enter the Grossmont College nursing program. In FY09, $99,000 was to enable Grossmont College to enroll 30 additional students in the nursing program. (Funded by Scripps Health System Operations) Scripps High School Exploration Program and Regional Allied Health and Science Initiative (RASHI) - Launched by Scripps Health this year, the program is designed to reach out to young people and pique their interest in health care occupations which are in dire need of recruits. From the emergency room to marketing, the students rotate through numerous departments, exploring career options and learning life lessons about health and healing along the way. During FY09, Scripps Health had a partnership with RASHI to provide continuing education internships for their students. The program offered eight week-long paid internships where 12 students rotated through clinical and non-clinical departments to learn about health care. Received $26,000 grant to continue to expand the scope of program across the San Diego community.

Charity Care - The portion of patient care services provided by Scripps for which a third-party payer is not responsible and a patient has the inability to pay. Charity care does not include bad debt, contractual adjustments, or under-reimbursed costs (payment shortfalls). Charity care may include unpaid coinsurance, deductibles, and non-covered services if the patient meets the Scripps charity care eligibility criteria. In-Lieu of Funds - Funds used for unfunded or underfunded patients and their post- discharge needs. Funds are used for board and care, skilled nursing facilities, long term acute care and home health. In addition funds are also used for medications, equipment and transportation services. Community Benefit Services - Programs/services offered to the community that go above and beyond what is provided as a normal part of patient care. Scripps Health categorizes Community Benefit services in three categories: Uncompensated Health Care - Includes charity, under-reimbursed care and ,bad debt. Shortfalls are derived using the payor based cost allocation methodology. Bad debt and charity care are estimated by extracting the gross write offs of bad debt and charity care charges and applying the hospital RCC to estimate net uncompensated cost. Community Health Services - Services and activities carried out to improve community health that usually do not generate a patient bill and are subsidized by the hospital. Community-Based Health Improvement Activities - These activities are carried out to improve community health and must be supported by a community need. They extend beyond patient care activities. They include services directed to individuals and to a larger population. Includes prevention and wellness programs as well as other community health improvement services (screenings, health education, support groups, and health fairs) supported by operational funds, grants, in- kind donations, 144and philanthropy. Calculations based on cost less direct revenue. Direct offsetting revenue includes any revenue generated by the activity or program, such as payment or reimbursement for services provided to program patients. Direct offsetting revenue does not include restricted or unrestricted grants or contributions that the organization uses to provide community benefit. Community Benefit Operations - Includes costs associated with planning and operating community benefit programs. Such as community health needs assessments and administration. Subsidized Health Services - Patient care services the organization provides despite a financial loss, (even) after removing the effects of charity care and Medi-Cal shortfalls (and bad debt). Clinical programs provided at a loss because they are needed by the community. The service meets an identified community need if it is reasonable to conclude that if the organization no longer offered the service, the service would be unavailable in the community, the community's capacity to provide the service would be below the community's need, or the service would become the responsibility of government or another tax-exempt organization. Example of such services are; inpatient psychiatric units, satellite clinics serving low-income communities, and burn units. Cash and In-Kind Contributions - Contributions made by the organization to health care organizations and other community groups that are restricted to one or more community benefit activities. In-kind contributions include the cost of hours donated by staff to the community while on the organization's payroll, indirect cost of space donated to tax-exempt companies (such as for meetings), and the financial value (generally measured at cost) of donated food, equipment and supplies. Community Building Activities - Programs that address underlying causes of health problems in order to improve health status and quality of life. They focus on the root causes of health problems, such as poverty, homelessness and environmental problems but do not provide medical care. Examples of community building per the Schedule H are housing improvements, economic development, community support, environmental improvements, leadership development, coalition building, community health improvement advocacy and workforce development. These activities support community assets by offering the expertise and resources of the health care organization. According to the IRS Community Building Activities do not count as Community Benefits under the new Schedule H 990 but are still reportable outside the community benefit table. 145 Professional Education and Health Research - Includes clinical research as well as professional education on non-Scripps employees including graduate medical education (GME), nursing resource development, and other health care professional training. Costs for medical residents and interns may be included as health professions educations costs. Calculations based on total program expense. Payer - Insurance companies, health care service plans, Medicare, Medi-Cal and other private or public entities that pay hospitals for health care provided to their sponsored patients. Research - Health related research, such as studies and papers on alternative health care delivery methods, testing of medical equipment and controlled studies of therapeutic protocols. Includes studies that are self funded or receive funding from a tax- exempt government entity and have a goal of generating knowledge that is made available to the public. Under-Reimbursed Care - Care that is reimbursed below cost by CMS (County Medical Services), Medi-Cal and Medi-Cal HMO, Medicare. Medicare PPO and Medicare HMO. Volunteer Hours - Includes the labor hours contributed by Scripps employees and affiliated physicians in support of Scripps sponsored activities for which no compensation is received. The dollar value is not included in Scripps' \"community benefit contribution\".146Appendix B - Scripps Uncompensated Care FY2009 Methodology Scripps continues to contribute resources to provide low- and no-cost health care services to populations in need. During FY09, Scripps contributed $255,584,160 to uncompensated health care, including $41,526,333 in charity care, $51,334,580 in Medi-Cal and Other Means Tested Government Programs, $146,475,561 in Medicare shortfall and $16,247,687 in bad debt. Schedule H Methodology Schedule H requires the uncompensated care to be divided into four categories: Charity care, under-reimbursed Medi-Cal and other means tested government programs, Bad Debt and under- reimbursed Medicare. Bad debt and Medicare shortfalls are reportable under the Schedule H guidelines but do not count towards the community benefit totals. Thus, the categories are reported in a specific order/hierarchy. Charity Care and under-reimbursed Medi-Cal and other means tested government programs are counted first. Charity Care Methodology The uncompensated cost is estimated by applying ratio-cost-to-charge (RCC) percentages for the hospital to the gross charity adjustments. The following costs are excluded: Community health services, professional education and research, and expenses excluded in the Medicare cost report. Medi-Cal and Other Means Tested Government Programs-Hospital The shortfall is derived by computing operating margin at the patient level and summarizing the patients with Medicare, Medicare PPO, Medicare HMO, Medi-Cal, Medi-Cal HMO and CMS primary insurance carriers. Operating margin is defined as net revenue less all variable, fixed and overhead costs. Profitability is estimated as follows: Net revenue is equivalent to payments plus an estimation of the account balance for all open accounts, plus revenue from uncompensated care pools including Medi-Cal DSH. Cost is derived using the relative value allocation methodology per the Trendstar Cost Accounting system. The following costs are excluded: Charity adjustments at cost for Medi-Cal and CMS patients, community health services, professional education and research, and expenses excluded in the Medicare cost report.147Bad Debt Methodology The uncompensated cost is estimated by applying ratio-cost-to-charge (RCC) percentages for the hospital to the gross bad debt adjustments less recoveries. The following costs are excluded: Bad debt adjustments at cost for Medi-Cal and CMS patients, community health services, professional education and research, and expenses excluded in the Medicare cost report. Medicare and Medicare HMO-Hospitals The shortfall is derived by computing operating margin at the patient level and summarizing the patients with Medicare and Medicare Senior primary insurance carriers. Operating margin is defined as net revenue less all variable, fixed and overhead costs. Profitability is estimated as follows: net revenue is equivalent to payments plus an estimation of the account balance for all open accounts, plus other revenue including IME and DSH. Cost is derived using the relative value allocation methodology per the Trendstar cost accounting system. The following costs are excluded: Charity and bad debt adjustments at cost for Medicare and Medicare Senior patients, community health services, professional education and research, subsidized health services provided to Medicare patients and expenses excluded in the Medicare cost report. Shortfall Methodology-Clinics The shortfall was derived by extracting the Medicare, Medicare PPO and Medicare HMO gross charges and net revenue from the patient billing system. The cost was estimated by applying the ratio-cost-to-charges for Scripps Clinic and Scripps Coastal Medical Centers to the gross charges.
