One Mission. Official News Publication for Loma Linda University Health M arch/April 2017 V olume 30, No. 2 TODAY A significant milestone has been reached in Loma Linda University Health's effort to build new health care facilities by 2020. The founda - tion slab for the new structure began to take shape on March 25, as 85 concrete trucks delivered more than 5,400 cubic yards of concrete to the building site. Trucks arrived at the rate of one per minute beginning at 10 p.m., ultimately delivering 540 loads in 10-1/2 hours. More than 100 workers directed the concrete into place. The project com - pleted one-third of the foundation for the new hospital towers. Work took place on Saturday night to minimize impact on local traffic and the current hospital's front entrance. The second phase of the foundation pour will take place in April. On site to witness the milestone was Eric Schilt, assistant vice president of construction for Loma Linda Univer - sity Medical Center. \"Overall, the pour was very success - ful,\" Schilt said. \"There is a tremendous amount of coordination that goes into a pour of this size, and the project team did an excellent job planning and exe - cuting it. \"Also of critical significance was the fact that there were no unplanned disruptions to hospital operations. On behalf of our team, I say thank you to our staff, patients and visitors for putting up with our noise!\" Schilt said. Schilt and numerous others from Loma Linda University Health and JTec Healthcare Construction Manage - ment have planned for years to reach this moment. \"A pour such as this is one is a rare opportunity to see significant progress in a single long shift,\" Schilt said. \"With a project this big and this long it can be difficult to see measurable progress on a daily basis. The pour was fun to watch.\" Construction progress can be followed on three webcams found online at http:/ /lluhvision2020.org/ live-construction-feed. Additionally, inter - ested individuals can visit the second floor corridor between the Medical Center and Children's Hospital for a good vantage point through the large windows. Those doing so may just find Medical Center CEO Kerry Heinrich taking in the view as well. \"Look carefully at the glass,\" he recently said. \"You'll see my nose print there because I try to go up there as often as I can. I love watching the prog - ress of our campus transformation and our new hospital towers. \"They will allow us to meet the needs of our growing community for many decades to come, offering a state-of-the-art facility for us to practice our special brand of whole person care,\" Heinrich said. Loma Linda University Health launched this hospital construction effort in response to stringent Califor - nia state regulations mandating that all Foundation for hospital construction project starts with 'Big Pour' Loma Linda University Health's new hospital facilities will meet California's stringent earthquake safety standards by 2020. hospitals in the state meet new seismic safety standards by 2020, or be shut down. As a Level 1 Trauma Center, Loma Linda University Health provides care to a large, underserved population in the Inland Empire region. The orga - nization's two main hospitals (Loma Linda University Medical Center and Loma Linda University Children's Hos - pital) also provide training to thousands of students and residents each year. Support for the hospital construc - tion effort is a significant component of Vision 2020: The Campaign for a Whole Tomorrow, a $360 million comprehen - sive philanthropic initiative, the largest in the history of Loma Linda University Health. Vision 2020 also represents the largest investment in health care and education in the Inland Empire. The Vision 2020 campaign sup - ports priorities in: Clinical Care, allowing Loma Linda University Health to continue pro - viding excellent health care in a new adult hospital and expanded chil - dren's hospital.

Two more pours will complete the foundation.TODAY2 March/April 2017 one homecoming 2017By Linda Uni - versity Health's signature events, Healthy People in Healthy Communi - ties (HPHC), kicked off the first full day of the annual alumni Homecom - ing celebration. However, this year's Homecoming was unlike those in years past \u2014 it is One Loma Linda Homecoming, encompassing all eight schools simultaneously. \"We are celebrating the legacy of Loma Linda University Health and the alumni who live this legacy every day,\" said President Richard H. Hart, MD, DrPH. Homecoming's opening event celebrated the city of Loma Linda's recognition as a Blue Zone\u00ae, one of five geographic areas in the world where residents have greater longevity. The only Blue Zone in the United States, Loma Linda was declared one in Dan Buettner's November 2005 cover story for National Geographic . Hundreds came out to experience the first International Symposium on Blue Zone Science & Health where experts from each of the five Blue Zones \u2014Sardinia, Italy; Okinawa, Japan; and Loma Linda \u2014gave updates on the most recent research as it relates to longevity in their respective regions. Their findings: wellness and lon - gevity is affected by diet and nutrition, physical activity, and one's social and spiritual well being. In other words, a term Loma Linda University Health is quite familiar with: wholeness. Michael Poulain, PhD, from Sar - dinia, the first validated longevity Blue Zone, emphasized the United States has opportunities to change the envi - ronment. \"There is a lot of soda in the U.S.,\" he said. \"But if we replaced all the soda fountains with water fountains, what a difference it could make.\" HPHC is the premier conference on lifestyle medicine and the built envi - ronment. The conference underlines Loma Linda University Health's legacy of promoting health, longevity and wholeness while creating a platform for exploring the role of Blue Zone areas as a paradigm for population health.Homecoming kicks off with 'healthy people' event in healthiest community Hundreds of people gathered at Loma Linda University Health's Drayson Center for Healthy People in Healthy Communities, Thursday, March 2. Welcoming Alumni Home The \"One Homecoming\" kickoff party brought together alumni, students and employees, past and present, the evening of March 2 to celebrate Loma Linda University Health's first organization-wide reunion weekend. The kickoff party, held in an event pavilion set up in the Drayson Center field, included carnival games, food vendors, a chance to pose with a cardboard cutout of President Richard Hart (above right), displays by schools (right), and a concert by the Wedgwood Trio (above).Dan Buettner, curator of the Blue Zones and a featured speaker for the Healthy People Conference, shared what people in the world are doing to live longer, healthier livesTODAY March/April 20173 one homecoming 2017By Nancy Yuen The world church's top health leader chal - lenged a gathering of Loma Linda University Health (LLUH) faculty and alumni to think differently about how they view mission service and their own health. Peter Landless, MD, health ministries director at the denomina - tion's world headquarters, said that while Loma Linda University alumni may think mission service happens in countries outside of the United States in the Church's hundreds of hospitals, dispensaries and clinics, it also occurs every day as patients visit their offices. Landless, a cardiologist who made his remarks during a LLUH alumni mission breakfast on campus March 3, encouraged each participant to sched - ule time to promote wholeness in their own lives, apart from work and service. \"When Jesus healed people, he addressed their mind, body and spirit,\" he told the audience. He added, \"The Seventh-day Adventist health message has been given to us to fit us for service because our work is not yet done.\"Adventist Church's Health Ministries director challenges alumni's ideas of service Peter Landless, MD, director, department of Health Ministries at the General Conference of Seventh-day Adven - tists, addressed alumni and faculty from Loma Linda University Health who have provided health care overseas.Landless traced the history of health care when people living with disease were viewed as having failed to follow natural health laws (works) to the belief that we are given health so that we can take care of ourselves to serve (grace). As it has pursued these principles, Loma Linda University Health has become a leader in research and whole person care. The impact on health and longevity was shared globally in Nov. 2006, when the city of Loma Linda was declared a Blue Zone\u00ae in a National Geographic cover story written by Dan Buettner. Blue Zones are areas of the world where people live much longer than the surrounding population. The event grew from a Mission Breakfast held each year, sponsored by the National Association of Seventh-day Adventist Dentists (NASDAD) and the School of Dentistry. Attend - ees were primarily faculty and alumni who have served as overseas missionaries. Doyle Nick, DDS, associate pro - fessor, LLU School of Dentistry, hosted the event. Nick, who once worked as a dentist in Asia, is also associate director for dental affairs for the Adventist Church's Health Minis - tries department. The breakfast, held during LLUH Homecoming, was an opportunity for alumni and faculty from LLU's eight schools who have provided health care overseas to gather and network. Research highlights featured during Homecoming weekend The depth of research quality occurring in Loma Linda University Health's eight schools took center stage at a four-day research symposium, held as part of the 2017 One Homecoming weekend. Researchers from the schools, centers and insti - tutes filled the fourth floor of the Centennial Complex, with poster presentations and lectures taking place throughout the One Homecoming celebration. Loma Linda University Health's research efforts took over the fourth floor of Centennial Complex during One Homecoming. Along with displays and posters (left), there were lectures throughout the weekend. Presen - tations included updates by Heather Javaherian-Dysinger, OTD, University Health leaders showcased the institution's establish - ment and longtime expansion of its mission at the Friday evening vespers service during the alumni One Homecoming weekend. Presenters spotlighted LLUH's collaboration with the nearby San Manuel Band of Mission Indians that stemmed from early outreach when sani - tarium doctors and students would ride horses across the valley to help deliver babies of tribal women, a practice that first began in 1911. Also, Pat Morris, former mayor of the nearby City of San Bernardino, highlighted how the uni - versity had offered pro bono services for troubled and abused youth over the years. Throughout the March 3 service, executives underscored their commitment to further expansion of services in Southern California's San Bernardino Valley, all building upon the organization's Seventh-day Adventist founding in 1905 to continue the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus Christ. \"This is San Bernardino and our history of our university being connected with our community,\" LLUH President Richard Hart, MD, DrPH, said to the audience at Loma Linda University Church. One presenter related the story of how Loma Linda's founding was contro - versial among Adventist Church officials. Church cofounder Ellen G. White visited the area and determined \"this is the very place\" to develop medical mis - sionaries for local and international service. The episode was presented by Loma Linda University Church Senior Pastor Randy Roberts impersonating John Burden, who is credited with having followed White's prompting to help found what was then known as the Loma Linda Sanitarium. The early debate over founding the sanitarium surrounded the cost of founding such an institution, Roberts said while portraying Burden. But Burden and other Adventists moved forward in securing land and establishing the sanitarium in faith, with needed funding often coming right before financ - ing deadlines. \"We have nothing to fear for the future except we should forget God's leading in our past,\" Roberts said quoting White. The audience was also updated with stories of LLUH's new San Ber - nardino Campus facility, which houses Social Action Corps Health System (SACHS) and LLUH's San Manuel Gateway College One student at the college, Edilma, said she hopes to give others what LLUH once gave her \u2014 she was a patient at LLUH's Behavioral Medicine Center when she was younger. \"God gave [me] those physicians and nurses [who] gave me another chance at living,\" she said, breaking with emotion. \"My goal is to be a psych nurse so I can give back what Loma Linda gave back to me, which is another chance at life.\" San Manuel Gateway College Executive Director Arwyn Wild said the college is appealing for mentors and coaches for students, many of whom need guidance in applying and studying for college courses. The spiritual service was part of the One Homecoming weekend in which alumni from all LLUH's eight schools are meeting simultaneously. \"There's nothing like having old friends get together,\" said Hart.Homecoming vespers program spotlights history, future of outreach Leaders present stories of continued expansion, service through faith Randy Roberts, vice president for spiritual life and mission, portrays John Burden, one of Loma Linda's founders.Richard Hart, Loma Linda University president, interviews Tribal Secretary, Ken Ramirez, from the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians, about the care Loma Linda University Health provided to tribal members over the decades.

It has to do with identity, with understanding who we are, why we are here,\" Roberts continued. \"As we remember, we are constituted a new people, with a new mission, focus and purpose. It's not just romantic, it's about core identity.\" From the first moments of the morning's service, alumni had opportunities to remember many of the strengths of Loma Linda Univer - sity Health possesses. A parade of more than 50 flags of countries around the world called to memory the university's diverse student body and represented the many countries of the world where Loma Linda University Health alumni serve. \"We want to express our thanks to each one of you alumni,\" said Ronald Carter, PhD, exec - utive vice president for university affairs. \"You have taken the education you received here, and used it to bring hope and healing to this world. You are our reputation. You are Loma Linda.\" Alumni then were reminded of Loma Linda University's core commitment to serve those in need around the world. \"Mission service changed my life,\" said Elaine Bersaba, a student in the School of Dentistry, speaking on behalf of the Students for International Mission Service program. \"I learned that God sends you to a specific time and place, so you can best know him.\" Bersaba went on to tell how, by performing a tooth extraction, she was able to help a woman who had been in pain for more than six months. This year more than 60 students are par - ticipating in Loma Linda's Deferred Mission Appointment and Global Service Award pro-grams. These two programs allow students to commit to overseas service after graduation, with the programs making payments on the students' debt each month they serve. \"The best time for students to be involved in world service is right when they graduate,\" said Richard Hart, MD, DrPH, Loma Linda University Health president. \"It's before they have to many ties and obligations holding them back.\" The men and women who have served Loma Linda University Health were also remem - bered. T wo former presidents, Norman Wood, and B. Lynn Beherns, and Anita Olsen, widow of former president V. Norskov Olsen, were rec - ognized. More than 50 former administrators also were in attendance. The morning's music was another powerful reminder of Loma Linda University Health's diverse student body. Music groups performing included the School of Public Health Choir, the Cheek Brothers Quintet, the Black Alumni of Loma Linda Chorale, and the School of Allied Health Signing Choir. \"Remembering roots us to our identity,\" Roberts said. \"We come together to remember not just the joy and the laughter, as important as those things are. We come together for a much deeper reason, to connect with our identity and connect with our mission.\"Alumni Come Together to Remember 'One Homecoming' worship service challenges alumni to reconnect with mission TODAY6 March/April 2017 one homecoming 2017The talent was incredible.

Sarah Schrader spoke to the crowd gathered at the Drayson Center before the start of the Loma Linda University Health Homecoming 5K Fun Run/Walk, saying her family will forever be connected with the family of Dr. Samuel Soret, immediate past chair of the School of Public Health's Environmental and Occupational Health department. Soret passed away from a heart attack in August 2016, while on a trip to Spain. The Homecoming 5K was held in memory of both Soret and Schrader's husband, Matthew Schrader, a 2001 graduate from the School of Allied Health Professions, who died in a motorcycle accident in 2014. While Craig Jackson, MSW, JD, dean, School of Allied Health Professions, joined the School after Schrader had graduated, he mentioned the many people who had shared their memories of the 2001 graduate with him. Schrader is remembered as a caring individual who didn't see his work as a physical therapy assistant as a job \u2014 he enjoyed the patients he worked with and took great joy in getting to know them personally. There was laughter as the family remembered how Matthew's daughters had taught him to appreciate sparkle and glitter; his daughter liked to give her daddy pink pedicures which, unbeknown to the patients he worked with as a physical therapy assistant, were hidden by his work shoes. In his memory, his family has started a scholarship, the Matthew Lynn Schrader Memorial Fund, for physical therapy assistant students at Loma Linda University. Helen Hopp Marshak, PhD, dean, School of Public Health, recalled Soret as a friend of more than 20 years. He faithfully served Loma Linda University for 21 years, most recently as associate dean for research and executive director of the School's center for community resilience. He was also a former chair of the school's environmental and occupational health department. To honor Soret's legacy and the students he was passionate about, a fund in his memory will support students studying environmental and occupational health or health geoinformatics at Loma Linda University.By James Ponder Loma Linda University Health's first annual One Homecoming Prayer Walk, which took place on Saturday, March 4, featured a creative setup to encourage participants to pray for various facets of the organization's work and mission. Attendees prayed for everything from personal wholeness, gratitude and forgiveness to students, faculty, alumni and the organization's global impact. Guests were greeted at 7 a.m. in front of the Mission Globe by volunteers of the School of Religion, who handed out a brochure outlining the purpose of the event and drawing attention to six prayer stations \u2014 picnic tables covered with black tablecloths. Each station offered an activity focused on its unique purpose. The first station focused on thankfulness and praise. With scriptural encouragement from Psalm 106:1, guests were invited to give thanks to God for His goodness, and to write a message of thankfulness on a poster at the table. The second station related to the theme of for - giveness and intercession and featured pens and slips of paper for participants to write the names of people they wanted to forgive. The third station contained small globes and featured the theme of community. The brochure instructed participants to think of themselves in terms of the local community that surrounds Loma Linda University Health as well as its worldwide impact. The fourth station featured groups of eight black stones on white sheets of paper. The stones represent the eight schools of Loma Linda University Health. Participants were invited to reflect on the people impacted by each school as they held the stones in their hands, asking God to guide and bless.

Reese went on to coordinate a group of vol - unteers to establish the Minority Introduction To Health Sciences (MITHS) program, which offers Black high school students a chance to spend three weeks on the Loma Linda University Health campus learning about opportunities at each of the eight schools. Today, more than 300 students have partici - pated in the program, which he founded in 1999. Nearly 99 percent of participants have graduated with an undergraduate degree, 72 percent have com - pleted or are pursuing master's level training, and 44 percent have completed or are enrolled in a doctoral program. Former participants periodically contact him when visiting the area, and several have mentioned they owe their success to him and the staff who operate the MITHS program. \"You can't come up with any amount of money to replace that kind of reward,\" Reese told a gather - ing of Black alumni at Homecoming on March 4. Reese is the associate dean of the LLUH School of Medicine's Los Angeles campus and chairman of the OB/GYN Department at White Memorial Medical Center in Los Angeles. He urged attendees to continue contributing to the MITHS program as well as the W. Augustus Cheatham scholarship fund, which supports Black students. \"Just because we're out making money now and everybody is all dressed up and successful doesn't mean we don't have a responsibility to give back,\" he said. Reese's activism as a LLU student in the early 1970s led to the school implementing numerous proposals for minority inclusion. This included a proposal that led to the hiring of Dr. Gaines R. Partridge, who was brought on board to recruit and advocate for minority students and retired as the dean of student affairs. Reese currently serves as treasurer of Black Alumni of Loma Linda. \"It is upon your shoulders, your valuable service, that the Black Health Professional Student Associ - ation of Loma Linda University has its heritage and identity,\" said current BHPSA president Jim Ervil. \"We honor you for your exemplary and purposeful contributions for minority students of Loma Linda for over 48 years.\" Reese also told the audience he supports Loma Linda University President Richard Hart's Diver - sity Council. The institution in recent years has phased out the position of vice president for diver - sity, and Hart has placed the responsibility for diversity inclusion upon all top executives. \"He really wants us to be successful at this institution and outside the institution,\" Reese said. \"Let us work together going forward.\" Neurosurgery professor briefs congressional caucus By Heather Reifsnyder When the U.S. Congressional Neurosci - ence Caucus hosted the sixth annual Brain Mapping Day briefing March 8 in Washington, D.C., a Loma Linda University professor was one of seven experts from across the nation who spoke. Warren Boling Jr., MD, chair of neu - rosurgery at Loma Linda University Health, illuminated the topic of \"Intraoperative Brain Mapping for Brain Tumor and Epilepsy.\" Much of what he presented he drew from Loma Linda University's data about the rapidly evolving use of functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging to make brain surgery safer and more effective. \"We had a good reception from our legislative members who attended and then had excellent follow up conversations with staff members for California Senator Kamala Harris,\" Boling said. \"We also had a wonderful meeting with Congressman Pete Aguilar, talking about Loma Linda University Health and the great things we're doing for the Inland Empire.\" The other speakers at the briefing also pre - sented \"groundbreaking and forward-thinking advances in the neurosciences,\" Boling said. He is president-elect for the Society for Brain Mapping and Therapeutics, which organized the meeting. His one-year term will begin in April, marking the first time someone from Loma Linda University has held such a high position with the society. Boling summarized, \"It was important for our legislators to hear about the obstacles and difficulties that we're having in improving patient care as well as the advances we're making and the exciting new things that are coming to improve the lives of our patients with neurologi - cal diseases. \"In the future we can tackle more compli - cated problems using these advanced mapping and imaging techniques.\" one homecoming 2017Black student group honors founder for promoting minority student opportunity Reese also established initiative offering high school students on-campus experiences Members of the Black Health Professional Student Association honored Leroy Reese, MD, for his efforts to offer Black high school students a program of on campus learning at Loma Linda Uni - versity Health.Warren Boling, MD, spoke to Congressio in March.TODAY March/April 20179 By Briana Pastorino There are nearly 6,000 hospitals in the United States, but not everyone wants to work in health care.

Thanks to the selfless act of families and individuals choosing to donate organs, a record-breaking streak of trans - plants for Loma Linda University Transplantation Institute was made possible. When organs become available, it's go time. Surgeons drop what they are doing and rush to the hospital to perform these life-saving transplants. For each organ that is recovered, surgical teams must be assembled, operating rooms cleared, and no one from the transplant teams rests until the lengthy procedures are completed. Phones began to ring on February 27 with organ offers and peaked on March 1, with five patients and six organs transplanted within 24 hours. The surgical streak concluded March 3 with two organs trans - planted. A 50-year-old received a donated liver and kidney, and ten individuals, ranging in ages from 13 to 70, received the gift of life through donated kidneys. Ultimately, 11 patients received transplants and a new lease on life within five days. These transplant surgeries set two new records for the LLU Transplantation Institute: most solid organs transplanted within five days and most organs transplanted within a 24-hour period. \"While the availability of organs is unpredict - able, we are prepared to meet this high demand,\" says Michael de Vera, MD, Transplantation Insti - tute director. \"We're so thankful to the physicians and staff at the Transplantation Institute as well as the Medical Center, including the staff of the oper - ating rooms, units 8100, 4700 and 4100, and other services. Transplant is a teamwork specialty, and these patients can't get served without everyone's help and commitment.\" The surgeons performing the transplants were de Vera, Arputharaj Kore, MD, Philip Wai, MD, and Pedro Baron, MD.

By Briana Pastorino Six Loma Linda University Health families are sleeping a little better thanks to Ashley Furniture HomeStore. As part of their Hope to Dream program, 11 beds were donated to six patients and their siblings. One of those patients is Sophia Rubio, 11, of Riverside, who has been a patient at Loma Linda University Children's Hospital since she was diagnosed with sys - temic Scleroderma, a rare and progressively debilitating disease, in 2009, when she was just 4 years old. Rubio and her two siblings each received a new twin mattress, bed frame, bedding and pillow from Ashley Furniture. In addition to the new beds, the six families were treated with a surprise trip to the Disney - land Resort in Anaheim, which included a meet and greet with Minnie Mouse and Mickey Mouse. Each family received park hopper tickets and met the Ashley Furniture Hope to Dream team. More than 50 beds have been donated to Loma Linda University Health families through the Hope to Dream program since April 2016. \"It is the hope of Ashley Furniture that Ashley Furniture provides beds to six patient families Sophia Rubio, left, sits with her mom, Claudia, on her new bed that was given to her by Ashley Furniture HomeStore on Feb - ruary 10.

Individuals and groups were recognized for their dedication and service to children throughout the Inland Empire By Briana Pastorino The 24th annual Foundation Storybook Gala was an enchanting success, raising over $1.2 million for Loma Linda University Children's Hospital (LLUCH). However, the event was more than about raising money\u2014it was also an opportunity to recognize key organizations and individuals who are essential to the hospital's success. Four awards were presented during this year's event, which took place at the Riverside Convention Center on Feb. 16. Alane Allbee, RN, was presented with the Hometown Hero Award, which recognizes the contributions of individuals who share a passion for children and help enrich the quality of life in the community. A charge nurse on the hematology/oncology unit at LLUCH, Allbee goes beyond the call of duty. She created the Spirit of Christmas project 25 years ago that she and other nurses work on all year to provide personalized gifts for patient families in need in the Inland Empire. \"I went in to nursing to make a difference in the lives of children,\" Allbee said. \"I want every patient to know that we are a second home for them, and we give our best.\" The Outstanding Clinician Award was presented to Stephen Ashwal, MD, a pediatric neurologist at LLUCH. The award recognizes individuals who have demonstrated a lifelong dedication and distinguished service pro - vided to children and who, through their professional career and advocacy, have demonstrated the desire and motivation to improve the lives of children in the Inland Empire. Now the chief of pediatric neurology, Ashwal joined LLUCH more than 40 years ago and has influenced more than a generation of pediatricians inter - nationally through his research and care of children. Frank and Mary Ann Xavier were honored with the Discover Lifetime Achievement Award, which recognizes outstanding dedication and lifetime distinguished service to children through their personal and professional lives. \"Few people have identified with our mission and culture like the Xaviers,\" said Richard H. Hart, MD, DrPH, president of Loma Linda University Health. \"Their participation in many events and commitment to our future is exemplary, and I am delighted to recognize them in this way.\" The fourth and final award presented during the gala was the Shirley N. Pettis Award, and it was given to Farmer Boys. The award recognizes those who, through volunteering and community service, have demonstrated the desire and motivation to improve the lives of the Inland Empire's children. Farmer Boys has raised more $655,000 for LLUCH during the past 16 years benefiting nearly every unit at the hospital. Restaurant founder and CEO, Demetris Havadjias, along with President and COO, Karen Eadon, accepted the award on behalf of Farmer Boys. \"It makes our job so much more meaningful when we're doing something that's making a difference in the lives of people,\" Eadon said of their most recent fundraiser for the hospital, \"and for us that means so much.\"Community members honored at annual Children's Hospital Foundation Gala Dr. Richard Chinnock, left, presents Dr. Stephen Ashwal with the 2017 Allbee, with the Hometown Hero Award.

The painting above his head depicts the stream that powers the mill.By James Ponder A serendipitous conversation led Brian Bull, MD, to an important discovery about the human gastroin - testinal system. \"Maureen and I ran across a func - tioning grain mill on a vacation to the Lake District of England in the late 1990s,\" said Bull, who recently retired as chair of professor of pathology and human anatomy at Loma Linda Uni - versity School of Medicine. Although the couple intended to stay only 45 minutes touring the picturesque town of Boot with its 700-year-old stone mill, the tour ended up lasting several hours when something the miller said caught Bull's attention. \"The miller had a very large library,\" Bull recalled. \"He was not only keeping the large millstones in good running order, he was also a scholar and very knowledgeable about the grain-milling process. One of the things he stressed was that the large millstones in a working mill have to be taken apart every few months for dressing.\" The miller explained that dressing the stones involved removing a var - nish-like coating that blurs their sharp right-angle edges. \"The millstones never touch,\" Bull said, \"but they have grooves cut into the grinding surfaces. As the grooves of one stone go over the grooves of the other, they 'scissor' the grain. But when varnish\u2014which is the residue of volatile oils in the grains\u2014builds up between them, that can't happen.\" The miller said that all grain was stone ground until steel milling tech - nology was introduced in the late 1890s. \"By the early 20th century, steel mills had completely taken over,\" Bull said. Although the new technology pro - duced a popular, very white flour, it came at an unforeseen cost. \"The miller explained that steel mills, with their very fine tolerances, could pop the wheat germ out of the grain before milling actually began,\" Bull said. \"They could also remove all of the wheat bran.\" Because all the volatile, wheat-germ oils that used to coat the millstones were now missing, the result was bran-free flour. Unlike stone ground flour, white flour can be stored at room tem - perature without going rancid. \"This flour is the foundation on which the fast food enterprise is built,\" he said. As a result, a major source of fiber, wheat germ, and wheat-germ oils in the Western diet disappeared almost overnight. \"In the large intestine,\" he contin - ued, \"there are many species of bacteria that break down bran and other types of fiber. These are the bacteria that make Vitamin B-12, Vitamin K, and a whole lot of other compounds\u2014such as short-chain fatty acids\u2014that act in beneficial ways throughout the body, including the brain. But all of this gets disrupted because of the change in milling.\" Bull said science knows very little about the bacteria in the human diges - tive tract. \"Most of what gut bacteria do is good,\" he reported, \"but that isn't true when it comes to their role in process - ing red meat. Red meat, after the gut bacteria get through with it, turns into a toxin that inhibits the metabolism of spent cholesterol, thereby allowing it to build up in the body.\" Although the toxic potential of red meat was discovered and reported about 18 months ago, Bull said most journalists love hamburgers, so they didn't cover the story.\"Lack of fiber in the diet\u2014wheat bran used to be a major source\u2014can lead to medical complications such as diverticulosis and diverticulitis,\" he observed. The first term describes a con - dition in which small, unwanted pockets balloon out from the gut wall. It causes gassiness, bloating, and abdominal swelling. If it pro- gresses far enough, however, it can lead to diverticulitis, a deadly disease from which 300,000 people suffer each year in the US. Bull says many of those afflicted will die. When Bull and his wife, who is also a physician, returned to the United States, he set out to develop a breakfast cereal to replenish the missing bran, wheat germ, volatile oils, and fiber that the human digestive tract needs. Bull said he and Maureen have been eating his mill-inspired cereal for breakfast every day since the late 1990s. The fit, slender Bull is a walking endorsement for the product. He added that readers interested in eating well should add whole-grain bread to their diet along with fruits such as raspberries, blackberries, and apples, all of which are high in soluble fiber. \"Don't buy bran cereal that lists microcrystalline cellulose among its ingredients,\" he concluded. \"It's basi - cally high quality sawdust.\" \"Don't buy bran cereal that lists microcrystalline cellulose among its ingredients. It's basically high quality sawdust.\" Brian Bull, MDTODAY March/April 201713 By James Ponder Marlowe Schaffner, MD, former vice presi - dent of medical affairs at Loma Linda Uni - versity and medical missionary to Africa, passed away March 1, 2017, in Loma Linda, California. He was 95. A spokesman for the San Bernardino County Coroner said he died of natural causes. Described by former Loma Linda University Medical Center President John D. Ruffcorn as both \"very personable, a very good and loyal friend\" and \"a very astute administrator who didn't mince words when he put forth his position,\" Schaffner served Ket - tering Medical Center in Kettering, Ohio, as president from 1969 to 1979 before moving to Loma Linda Uni - versity Medical Center later that year. He served as vice president at Loma Linda until his retirement in 1983. Following his post as vice president, Schaffner worked as an emergency room physician at Loma Linda University Medical Center and later at Menifee Valley Medical Center and Hemet Valley Medical Center, a position he still held at the time of his death. Born Feb. 10, 1922, in Salem, Oregon, Schaffner attended the College of Medical Evangelists, the precursor to today's Loma Linda University School of Medicine, graduating as a member of the class of 1946. While in medical school, he concurrently served for two years as a member of the United States Army. Following an internship at White Memorial Hospital in Los Angeles, he finished his military service with another two year-stint as a physician assigned to the Veteran's hospital in Walla Walla, Washington. He then entered private practice in Cottage Grove, Oregon. In 1953, Schaffner and his family moved to Africa at the request of the Seventh-day Adventist Church to serve as medical director of Songa Mission Hospital in Zaire for seven years. However, national upheaval forced the Schaff - ners to flee the area in July 1960. Schaffner worked for several months at Malamulo Hospital in Malawi while waiting for the tumult in Zaire, then known as the Belgian Congo, to subside. The following year, he flew back to Songa \u2014 leaving his family behind as the Schaffner served as Loma Linda University executive, missionary to AfricaServices held for Marlowe Schaffner conflict was still raging \u2014 in an attempt to re-establish medical work there. But when the fighting showed no signs of abating, he finally rejoined his family in Decem - ber of that year in the southern city of Elisabethville, known today as Lubumbashi. In a May 17, 2007, article in Loma Linda City News, writer Don Roth reported that the Schaffners were present during several rebellions. \"Everyday life at times was perilous,\" he wrote. \"T wice his family escaped rebels who were on the loose. Another time, he and other mis - sionaries met in a building that stood between rebels and United Nations troops.\" The Congo Crisis ended when Colonel Joseph Mobutu of the Congolese National Army orchestrated a coup and took control of the gov - ernment in November 1965. Schaffner was eventually appointed medical secre - tary for the Trans-Africa Division of the church, an entity located in Zimbabwe that was later renamed. During the 16 years he and his family served in Africa, Schaffner per - formed an average of 700 operations per year ranging from routine procedures such as setting broken bones and cor - recting hernias to complex eye surgeries. Roth reported that Schaffner later contrasted that with \"specialty sur - geons in the United States who do an average of 300-400 procedures a year.\" Schaffner was no less busy during retirement. Roth reported that after he worked for 35 years as an emergency physician, the American College of Emer - gency Room Physicians recognized Schaffner as \"the longest continuously practicing, board-certified Emergency Department physician in the entire United States.\" In his personal life, Schaffner enjoyed traveling to Europe and Asia and serving in leadership roles for a number of organizations, including the Seventh-day Adventist Hospital Association, the Alumni Association of the School of Medicine of Loma Linda University, the Canyon Lake Fine Arts Guild, and the Canyon Lake Property Owners Association. He is survived by wife Mavis, children Ronald Schaffner, Richard Schaffner, Gregory Davis, Rita Corbett, Roberta Schaffner, and Kimberly Davis, 15 grand - children and 16 great-grandchildren. A memorial service took place April 1, at the Loma Linda University Church. The Inland Empire Economic Part - nership (IEEP) announced that Loma Linda University has been selected as one of its 2017 Honorees. Selected as Education Partner of the Year, \"Loma Linda University has demon - strated exemplary leadership in bettering the business climate and quality of life of the Inland Empire,\" said Paul Granillo, CEO and president of IEEP. Ronald Carter, PhD, Loma Linda University provost, said, \"Loma Linda is committed to this community and its citizens. As an organization, we strive to provide opportunities for individu - als to prosper personally, spiritually and economically.\" At the Loma Linda University Health 2016 Research Affairs Sympo-sium held on campus in October, John Husing, PhD, and chief economist for the Inland Empire, reported that Loma Linda University Health pumps more than $1.336 billion into the Inland Empire economy each year. Husing predicted that the organization's finan - cial impact will grow far beyond that in coming years as recent graduates of the college find high-paying health care jobs and begin spending their money in local communities. Loma Linda University Health's newest campus, which opened in 2016, will serve as a clinical and educational facility in the heart of the San Ber - nardino inner city. The Loma Linda Loma Linda University honored by the Inland Empire Economic Partnership University-San Bernardino campus, in addition to providing certificate-level training programs in a variety of health professions, houses the SAC Health System, which provides health care for 200,000 people each year. \"By using their talents, expertise and influence, honorees such as Loma Linda University stand out among those who make the area a better place to live for the 4.4 million people of the region,\" Granillo said. The Inland Empire Economic Part - nership is the region's voice for business and quality of life. Its membership, a collection of important organizations in the private and public sector, gives the organization the knowledge and perspective needed to advocate and provide a vibrant business and living environment. Loma Linda University Health has been honored by the Inland Empire Economic Partnership for its efforts to better the business climate and quality of life for area residents.TODAY14 March/April 2017 9-year-old philanthropist donates birthday money to LLU Children's Hospital Three teams of researchers receive GRASP Awards By James PonderBy Briana Pastorino Ulysses Hsu, 9 got a well-deserved high- five form LLUCH mascot Luke the Lion Monday march 6 after he donated his birthday money to the hospital to support Vision 2020. Instead of unwrapping gifts at his birthday party, Ulysses Hsu, 9, of Eastvale, was taking dona - tions for Loma Linda University Children's Hospital (LLUCH). At his ninth birthday party, Hsu told his friends that he wanted to help support Vision 2020: The Campaign for a Whole Tomorrow, and by doing so he raised over $1,600. He stopped by LLUCH March 6 and pre - sented a check for $1,636 to hospital mascot Luke the Lion in the lobby. Patients and staff also came down to meet Hsu, who was accompanied by his parents. \"Loma Linda University Children's Hospital is not an ordinary hospital,\" Hsu said. \"It is a place of happiness, love, comfort and warmth.\" This is not the first time Hsu has delivered a check the hospital. The junior philanthropist first donated money from his eighth birthday in 2016 in honor of a friend who had cancer Jill Payne, assistant vice president of phi - lanthropy at Loma Linda University Health emphasized that Hsu's benevolence has sparked a trend in the Give Now Build Hope campaign. \"You inspired a lot of people this year,\" Payne said to Hsu, adding that several other kids have donated their birthday money to Vision 2020. \"You've started a movement.\" Give Now Build Hope is the public giving campaign that encourages anyone to give at any level toward the new Children's Hospital tower. \"Every little bit helps,\" said Joe Perry, assistant vice president of finance at LLUCH. \"This is an amazing accomplishment and you make such a big difference in building hope for our patients.\" The office of research affairs at Loma Linda University Health recently announced that three teams of two researchers each have been named winners of the 2016 GRASP Awards. The acronym stands for Grants for Research and School Partnerships. According to Anthony Zuccarelli, PhD, vice president for research affairs, the three were chosen from a field of 14 applications involving 26 coprincipal investigators from seven Loma Linda University (LLU) schools. Zuccareli observed that each application was reviewed and scored by a panel of 15 or more senior researchers. \"Based on the combined scores of the reviewers,\" he noted, \"three projects with investigators from five different schools were selected for awards, fulfilling the GRASP objective to encourage collaborative research between researchers in various parts of the institution.\" The $75,000, 24-month awards went to the following teams: Lisa Roberts, DrPH, associate professor at LLU School of Nursing, and Susanne Montgomery, PhD, associate dean and professor at LLU School of Behavioral Health Kristopher Boyle, PhD, assistant professor at LLU School of Pharmacy, and Eileen Brantley, PhD, assistant professor at LLU School of Medicine Ellen D'Errico, PhD, associate professor at LLU School of Nursing, and Gayathri Nagaraj, MBBS, assistant professor at LLU School of Medicine. Roberts and Montgomery's study\u2014titled \"Understanding health and emotional responses and perceptions of Asian-Indian needs\"\u2014will focus on a mindfulness-based stress-reduction intervention designed to help Asian-Indian immigrant women living in the United States cope with challenging social-adjust - ment situations that predispose them to elevated levels of anxiety and depression. Boyle and Brantley's study\u2014titled \"AhR agonist analogs as novel agents to treat refractory breast cancer\"\u2014seeks to test a potential treatment for the deadly disease which, according to the Centers for Disease Control, currently kills approximately 40,000 women per year in the United States alone. D'Errico and Nagaraj's study\u2014titled \"Intraneural facilitation: managing chemotherapy-indirect peripheral neuropathy\"\u2014will evaluate the effectiveness of a novel, non-invasive, physical therapy treatment for a painful, annoying, and sometimes very serious side effect of chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. Zuccarelli points out that the GRASP Awards were instituted on campus in 2010 to address an imbalance. \"Research expertise is not evenly distributed throughout the schools of Loma Linda University,\" he observed. \"Most of the extramural grant awards go to faculty in one school. However, there are faculty members in all eight of our schools with research capability.\" As evidence, Zuccarelli points to calendar year 2015. In that year, the LLU School of Medicine enjoyed gross expenditures of extramural funding of $19.7 million, while all the other schools of Loma Linda University saw less than $3 million each. Some saw significantly less than that. He is very optimistic about the effectiveness of the GRASP program. \"The GRASP Award program is already having an impact,\" Zuccarelli reports. \"Not only does it give researchers from around the campus of Loma Linda Univer - sity an opportunity to get their studies funded, but it also allows less-experienced investigators to team up with veteran researchers who know their way around the laboratory as well as the requirements of national funding agencies.\" This past year, the program paid off in a significant new way. \"For the first time since the GRASP program began,\" Zuccarelli concludes, \"we received an equivalent amount of extramural funding for research that origi - nated as GRASP projects. We have now balanced all monies paid out to date with funds coming in from outside research funding sources. We look forward to the day when GRASP-funded projects will lead to significant new innovations in patient care.\" Ulysses Hsu was able to share more than $1,600 that family and friends donated in honor of his ninth birthday. Ulysses wanted to support Vision 2020 rather than receiving birthday presents. \"Loma Linda University Children's Hospital is not an ordinary hospital, \" said Ulysses.

Currently the Institute has three major strategic initiatives\u2014oral health, hunger as a health issue, and integrating mental and behavioral health into overall health policy. \"We are able to bring together scholars from across the campus to contribute to our work in these areas,\" Kim said. \"The Institute has a Faculty Scholars Program, which brings full-time faculty from different Schools on campus to engage in dialogue and col - laboration.\" Currently 11 Loma Linda University Health faculty members serve as Scholars in this program. \"Our mission is to serve the whole LLUH entity,\" Kim said. \"This allows us to tap into the various talents that are here. We also have a great team here at the Institute.\" One of the Institute's early initia - tives was a program to educate health care providers about the Affordable Care Act and the Covered California health insurance exchange program. An outgrowth of that early education effort has been the establishment of regular \"Spotlight on Health Policy\" programs held at least three times per year on the Loma Linda campus. \"It's important that our campus population is aware of these signifi - cant health policy issues,\" Kim said. \"Our programs have included infor - mation about California's End of Life Option Act, recent ballot initiative that legalized marijuana, and integra - tion of mental health into primary care among other topics.\" The Institute regularly produces publications, policy briefs, and other documents on significant health issues which are available on the resources page of the Institute website. They also publish a blog to raise awareness about relevant health policy topics and conduct conferences with community leaders. Much of the Institute's output can be found on their website. Along with her role as Institute director, Kim is Assistant Professor of Pediatrics and of Preventive Medicine in the Loma Linda University School of Medicine and Assistant Professor for the School of Public Health. She earned her medical degree from Johns Hopkins University and obtained her masters in public health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Her undergraduate degree is from Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and Interna - tional Affairs. As she was completing her post- graduate work at Hopkins, Kim was anticipating serving the Seventh-day Adventist Church internationally. Those plans changed\u2014at least for the time being. \"A woman promoting support for international orphanages visited my local church in Baltimore,\" Kim recalled. \"After that visit, the woman connected me with Dr. Hart because of my interest in medical missions.\" While very much aware of Loma Linda University, Kim had not con - sidered moving to California as an option. \"But you know how Dr. Hart is,\" Kim said. \"Very persuasive.\" Hart had the heads of the pediatric, preven - tive medicine, and public health areas contact her. Then she received a phone call from the head of the Institute for Health Policy and Leadership. After talking to Winslow and praying about it, Kim said, \"I felt God wanted me to do this.\" Clearly, Kim's days are full as she teaches, sees patients and provides leadership to the Institute. But her dream of serving internationally is still something she sees in her future. \"God has a special plan,\" she said. \"I've realized that while I'm here at Loma Linda, I am creating a network and meeting people who have a similar vision. What I'm doing for Loma Linda is part of my path to becoming a medical missionary.\" Institute for Health Policy and Leadership appoints new director Wonha Kim seeks to promote community wellness through public health policy and education efforts. Wonha Kim, new director for the Institute for Health Policy and Leader - ship, plans to continue the education, leadership and research activities there. "}
