NYU Langone's Rusk Rehabilitation was founded on a basic principle: physical medicine and rehabilitation shouldn't focus solely on illness or disability; they should involve the whole person\u2014emotionally, psychologically, and socially.

Today's Rusk Rehabilitation is an evolution of an idea first put into action by Dr. Howard A. Rusk, widely considered the father of rehabilitation medicine and the program's namesake. Dr. Rusk's philosophy was inspired by the challenges he saw in injured veterans returning from World War II, and he was passionate about giving people the tools they needed to live life to its fullest. We continue that commitment and work with you individually to achieve your goals and overcome any challenges, so you are empowered to live life on your terms. Rusk Rehabilitation doctors, known as physiatrists, are specialists in rehabilitation medicine. 333 East 38th Street, New York, NY, 10016 171 Delancey Street, 2nd Floor, New York, NY, 10002 240 East 38th Street, 15th Floor, New York, NY, 10016 301 East 17th Street, New York, NY, 10003 555 Madison Avenue, New York, NY, 10022 550 First Avenue, New York, NY, 10016 186 Joralemon Street, Brooklyn, NY, 11201 74 Kent Street, Lower Level, Brooklyn, NY, 11222 150 55th Street, Brooklyn, NY, 11220 1300 Avenue P, Brooklyn, NY, 11229 230 60th Street, Brooklyn, NY, 11220 5008 Seventh Avenue, Brooklyn, NY, 11220 9000 Shore Road, East Building, Lower Level, Brooklyn, NY, 11209 5610 Second Avenue, Brooklyn, NY, 11220 97-85 Queens Boulevard, Rego Park, NY, 11374 1530 Front Street, East Meadow, NY, 11554 1300 Franklin Avenue, Suite LL2, Garden City, NY, 11530 180 East Pulaski Road, Huntington, NY, 11746 1991 Marcus Avenue, Suite M115, Lake Success, NY, 11042 77 Medford Avenue, Patchogue, NY, 11772 877 East Main Street, Suite 106, Riverhead, NY, 11901 16244 South Military Trail, Suite 560, Delray Beach, FL, 33484 Physicians and family members may refer a patient by calling [212-263-6037](tel:212-263-6037).
