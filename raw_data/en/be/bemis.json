To this day, that competitor is still treated by many within the mainstream medical clan as questionable when it comes to its legitimacy as a medical practice: chiropractic. Back in 1962, the AMA actually formed a \"Committee on Quackery\". Although it was officially disbanded in 1974 after being publicly exposed, it was later determined by a federal judge to have been established solely for the purpose of leading a conspiracy of \"systematic, long-term wrongdoing and the long-term intent to destroy a licensed profession.\" Many conventional doctors have long hated chiropractors because, unlike themselves, chiropractors possess unique healing skills that often aren't taught in the drug industry-generated curriculum of mainline medical schools. Patients who become frustrated with popping pharmaceuticals prescribed by their conventional MDs for every ailment and never finding relief often turn to chiropractors instead, much to the chagrin of the white coat dinosaurs. Rather than humble themselves and admit that they aren't the bearers of all things knowledge and truth, many conventional doctors within the AMA have instead conspired to destroy the chiropractic profession, a mission that has since come back to bite them. As reported in a 1987 New York Times article, a group of chiropractors successfully sued the AMA for violating antitrust laws with its efforts to \"contain and eliminate the chiropractic profession.\" Judge Susan Getzendanner reportedly ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, agreeing that the AMA had unjustly labeled all chiropractors as \"unscientific cultists,\" harming their practices and depriving chiropractors of normal association with medical physicians. The AMA had also, in Judge Getzendanner's judgment, injured the reputation of chiropractors with its \"name-calling practice.\" \"There has never been an affirmative statement by the AMA that it is ethical to associate with chiropractors,\" stated Judge Getzendanner at the time, rejecting false claims by the AMA and its associates that it had never intentionally gone against the chiropractic profession. Despite court conviction, AMA continues to illegally target chiropractic and other natural healing arts This major victory for chiropractic was significant at the time, but things have gotten worse in many ways since then with the further monopolization of medicine in the U.S. While so-called \"alternative\" medicine \u2014 that is, medicine that's not officially sanctioned by the legal drug cartels \u2014 has continued to flourish all throughout the country, the AMA's conspiracy to conglomerate its power and influence whenever and wherever possible has also expanded. The eye-opening documentary film Doctored, which is now available for instant streaming through Amazon Prime, deals extensively with the medical profession's sordid history. Included in the film are revelations about how the AMA, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and others have repeatedly conspired to destroy all forms of holistic care that don't involve the typical slash-and-burn, drug and vaccine \"treatments\" dispensed by the establishment. Any segment of the medical community today that dares to tell people how the human body is fully capable of healing itself without pharmaceuticals or vaccines, for example, given that appropriate nutrition and other natural care is in place, is still generally ostracized by the mainstream medical profession and labeled \"quackery.\" Nothing has really changed, as real healing practitioners must continue to defend themselves against the corporate sorceries that rule the day. \"Even with the success of the Wilkes Case and other anti-trust litigation, the AMA continues to this day to wage a campaign against chiropractic,\" explains Your Medical Detective. \"Today, the attacks take the form of over-stated concerns for the safety of chiropractic health care.\" AMA spends nearly (NaturalNews) In the not-too-distant past, the American Medical Association (AMA), which touts itself as the largest association of physicians in the United States, actively conspired to destroy what it perceived as one of its biggest competitors.
