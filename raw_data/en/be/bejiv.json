ABSTRACT Neisseria meningitidis capsular polysaccharides are the main target of the protective immune response against bacterial meningitis. They are thymus-independent type 2 (TI-2) antigens that are poorly immunogenic and not protective in young children, and their administration may impair subsequent challenge with the same polysaccharide. These pro- blems have been addressed using three different vaccines consisting of 1) polysaccha ride alone, 2) polysaccharide covalently conjugated to a carrier protein, and 3) polysaccharide with Proteoliposome (PL) adsorbed onto Al(OH) 3. VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae is one of the third types of vaccine. It contains PL (detergent-extracted external membrane pro- teins forming vesicles) and polysaccharide (Ps) from N. meningitidis serogroups B and C (PsC), respectively. Nevertheless, there is a concern that to overcome the TI-2 natu re of Ps the covalently conjugation to a carrier is manda- tory. Therefore, we evaluated the immune response induced by VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae in infants and toddlers in order to determine whether it stimulates the response against the PsC. High IgG anti PsC and anti PL responses were seen following the administration of two doses in infants and toddlers, after a 3rd dose in pre-teenagers, and after confirmed carrier stages in young adults. The anti PL IgG response persisted longer than anti PsC IgG response and IgM response against both antigens was maintained. An IgG 1 anti PL response predominated, as well as IgG 4 > IgG 3 > IgG 1 anti PsC responses. These results suggest that non-covalent incorporation of PsC onto Al(OH) 3 containing PL as adjuvant is immunogenic, primes for memory, and induces long-lasting specific antibody response. The improved PsC immuno- genicity of this vaccine may be due to the preferential and potent Th1 response induced in mice and human by the PL as adjuvant. Keywords: Proteoliposome; Meningococcal 2 which induce IgM and IgG antibodies in adults; they neither induce immunological memory, nor boost the response after primary immunisation and do not contribute to herd im- munity. Furthermore, Ps can induce the phenomenon of hyporesponsiveness, which more of the knowledge comes from the experiments conducted with meningo- coccal Ps vaccine serogroup C [1-3]. In addition, a rapid decline of serum antibodies, especially in children less than 4 years old, was reported [4,5]. These features con- trast with the fact that Ps ar e the main target of protection in many bacterial infections. For these reasons, three different strategies have been used for immune prophy- laxis against these bacteria. The first, Ps-based vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A and Haemophilus influenzae b were developed [1] and they proved unsuccessful in in- fants. Subsequently, Ps vaccines were introduced against groups W 135 and Y; a meningococcal quadrivalent A, C, W135, and Y Ps vaccine, which has been licensed in the United States since 1981. As a second approach, Ps vac- cines were covalently conjuga ted to T cell-dependent (TD) [6,7]. This procedure transformed Ps TI-2 into TD antigens, which stimulated T cell help. This allowed the induction of higher specific antibody responses, in- creased antibody affinity, and priming Are Immunogenic in Infants and Toddlers and Primes for Memory against Serogroup C Polysaccharide 78 memory. Furthermore, because of their ability to recruit T cell help, these conjugate antigens also stimulated re- sponses in infants and toddlers whose B cells were unre- sponsive to the unconjugated form of the Ps [3,8,9]. The third alternative is the non-covalent incorporation of Ps either on the surface of or within liposome structures. Native serogroup B Ps can not be used to vaccinate against N. meningitidis serogroup B due to its low im- munogenicity and more importantly the concern that it use could lead to an autoimmune response due to cross reactivity with human tissue [10]. The wild-type outer membrane vesicle (wtOMV) vaccines are the only for- mulations that have shown efficacy against serogroup B meningococcal disease [11]. The Cuban meningococcal vaccine contains outer membrane vesicles (Proteoliposome, PL) serogroup and Ps from adsorbed onto Al(OH) 3 gel [12- 14]. VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae induced a good response against the PL, when it was evaluated in nursing babies [15]. However, little is known about the response induced against the second main antigen, PsC, although but epi- demiological studies have shown protection also against serogroup C. Nevertheless, Ps vaccines have been used mainly in mass campaigns vaccinating children during outbreaks, and concerns have been expressed about the induction of immunological hypo-responsiveness [16,17] against PsC. This is assuming as the reduced induction of specific antibodies and its functional bactericidal activity, but not the absence of them. This problem is overcome by the conjugate PsC vaccine [18]. In Cuba since 1991, VA-MENGOC-BC \u00ae has been in- cluded in the National Immunization Program. The first dose is administered to infants of 3 months of age and the second one 6 to 8 weeks later. Cuban vaccination cover- age is over 99% with all children vaccinated against meningococcal meningitidis (BC) [19]. However, the possibility of the induction of hypo-responsiveness to PsC to subsequent challenge must be investigated but unfortunately the PsC conjugated vaccine in 1997-1998, when this work was performed, was not available yet. Therefore, we determined serum anti PL and anti PsC IgG responses from VA-MENGOC-BC \u00ae vaccinees. The response against a challeng e (either natural or a 3rd dose of the vaccine) was also ev aluated. High immune re- sponses at specific and bactericidal levels against both antigens were induced. 2. Material and Methods Antigen preparation. PL of the epidemic meningococ- cal serogroup B was grown until early stationary phase and PL was extracted by 0.1 M tris-HCl, pH 8.6, 10 mM EDTA, and 0.5% (w/v) Na deoxycholate. This was purified by sequential centrifugation steps at 20,000 x g for 30 min. Following ultracentrifugation at 125,000 x g for 2 h, the pelleted PL was homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, purified by chromatography and further purified by column chroma- tography [13,14]. PsC was produced from N. meningitis- dis strain C11 (ATCC) at the Fi nlay Institute as described in [20]. Subjects and immunization. The population under study consisted of 408 subjects under 18 years old from Havana and Holguin Cuban provinces during 1997-1998. Two cross-sectional studies we re carried out. One to de- termine the induction of meningococcal immune re- sponse in 63 infants (<3.5 - 8 months of age) and the other to evaluate duration of the specific immune re- sponse that include 88 toddler (9 - 12 months of age), 136 children (from 2 to 10 years old), and 35 pre-teen- agers and teenagers (from 11 - 15 years old) were per- formed. All subjects were vaccinated with two 0.5 mL doses of VA-MENGOC-BC \u00ae (Finlay Institute, Havana, Cuba) at 3.5 months and the second one at 6 to 8 weeks later during infant life. Each dose contains 50 \u00b5g of puri- fied outer membrane vesicles of serogroup B 50 \u00b5g of purified PsC adsorbed onto Aluminium Hydroxidegel. The vaccination was performed by family doctors and was verified by us during sample collection. For ethical reasons, the sera from infants, toddlers, and children came from subjects that were admitted for blood test, with the agreement of their parents, at the Juan Manuel Marquez Paediatric Hospital, Havana, Cuba. No samples from immunedeficiencies, malignant disorders, immu- nosuppressive treatments, severe/chronic illness, or his- tory of previous meningococcal disease were included. Also, three interventional studies were conducted. The first one was to determine the memory response induced. Twenty vaccinated teenagers from Holguin province were challenged with a third dose (a booster dose) of the vaccine and blood samples were taken before and 21 days after the booster. Sec ond one was to evaluate the influence of natural challeng e over PsC specific immune response in internal stud ent accommodation facility in Havana. Forty six healthy young adults (17 and 18 years old) where the risk of natural transmission was high were included. Carrier state was evaluated by cultures of na- sopharyngeal exudates immedi ately before taking the blood sample. The third was to determine the specific IgG subclass response induced and the PsC specific im- mune response. Fifteen healthy young adults (17 and 18 years old) from the same student facility were immu- nized with one dose 0.5 mL of group A-C meningococcal Ps vaccine containing 50 \u00b5g each of meningococcal groups A and C Ps (Mengivac Are Immunogenic in Infants and Toddlers and Primes for Memory against Serogroup C Polysaccharide 79 All individuals were requested to donate blood sample and signed informed consent were obtained from each participant, his/her parent or legal guardian. Vaccination status and age of vaccination were recorded. The study proposals were approved by the Ethical Testing Com- mittee at the Finlay Institute. Measurement of anti Proteoliposome antibody class- es by ELISA. A standardized ELISA was performed in duplicate in microtiter plates (Maxisorp, Nunc, Denmark) as described [21]. Briefly, plates were coated with 100 L per well of a suspension of 20 g/mL PL in Na 2CO 3- NaHCO 3 (0.1 M and pH 9.6) buffer at 4 C overnight. After washing with 0.05% Tween-20 in distilled water (used in all washes), plates with samples or controls di- luted in 3% skimmed milk in PBS were incubated for 1 h at 37 C. After three washes in 0.05% Tween-20, the plates were incubated with 100 of horse- radish peroxidase-labelled goat anti-human IgG antibody (Sigma, USA) for 1 h at 37 C. After washing as de- scribed above, 100 \u00b5L per well of the substrate-chromo- gen mixture (O-phenylendiamine and H 2O2 citratephos- phate buffer, pH 5) were added. The reaction was stop- ped by adding 2 M H 2SO 4 and the absorbance measured in a micro-plate reader (Titertek, Multiskan Plus) at 492 nm. All ELISA results were ex pressed as arbitrary units per mL, referred to an in-house standard. Titres higher than 367 units were considered as positive. The same methodology for IgM and IgA was used with the excep- tion of anti IgM and IgA conjugates and in the absence of a standard the results were expressed in OD and consid- ered positive if it was 0.4. Anti polysaccharide C an tibody classes measured by ELISA. A standardized ELISA was performed in duplicate in microtiter plates (Maxisorp, Nunc, Denmark) as previously described [22]. Briefly, anti PC antibodies were detected by using sensitized plates with 0.5 g of poly-L-lysine (Sigma, USA) per well for 1 h at 37 C. Plates were washed five time with PBS, coated overnight at 4 C with 2.5 g/mL of PC per well, and blocked with 3% skimmed milk for 1 h at 37 C. After washing in PBS with 0.05% Tween-20, plates with samples or controls diluted in PBS containing 3% skimmed milk were incu- bated for 1 h at 37 C. After three washes, the plates were incubated with 100 \u00b5L per well of goat anti human IgG horseradish peroxidase-labelled antibody (Sigma, USA) for 1 h at 37 C. After washing as above, the substrate- chromogen mixture (O-phenylendiamine and H 2O2 cit- rate-phosphate buffer, pH 5) were added, 100 \u00b5L per well. The reaction was stopped by adding 2 M H 2SO 4 and the absorbance measured in a micro-plate reader (Titertek, Multiskan Plus) at 492 nm. All ELISA results were expressed as arbitrary units per mL, referred to an in-house standard. Titres higher than 367 units were con- sidered as positive. The same methodology for IgM and IgG was used with the exception of anti IgM and IgA conjugated and in the absence of a standard the results were expressed in optical density (OD) and were consid- ered positive if it was 0.4. Determination of IgG subclasses. ELISA tests were performed according to standard protocols. Briefly, the plates were coated with 20 g/mL of PL in Na 2CO 3- NaHCO 3 (0.1 M and pH 9.6) buffer at 4C overnight. After saturation with 1% of bovine serum albumin (Sigma, USA), plates were incubated with test sera for 2 h followed by anti IgG 1, IgG 2, IgG 3, or IgG 4 biotinylated antibodies for 2 h and streptavidin peroxidase complex for 1 h. One hundred \u00b5L per well of the substrate-chro- mogen mixture (O-phenylendiamine and H 2O2 citrate- phosphate buffer, pH 5) were added. The reaction was stopped by adding 2 M H 2SO 4 and the absorbance meas- ured (Titertek, Multiskan Plus) 492 nm. Tests were considered positive the OD was 0.4. Colorimetric Bactericidal Activity (cSBA). cSBA was performed as previously Briefly, microtitre plates with a bact erial inoculums col- forming 385-83 serogroup B N. meningi - tidis strain (37 with a 30 minutes incubation) or C11 ATCC serogroup C N. meningitidis strain (37 C with a 60 min. incubation) were used. The assay for serogroup B was performed in the pres ence of external human plasma and for serogroup C in the presence of baby rab- bit serum as complement sources. Glucose and bro- mocresol purple pH indicator were added to the medium to estimate growth of cSBA target cell survivors through colour change. The reciprocal of the highest serum dilu- tion causing complete inhibition of bacterial grown marked by the colour invariability of pH indicator was recorded as the bactericidal titer. cSBA was performed only in sera from subjects less than 12 months. Statistical Analysis Geometric mean titres (gmt) and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the graph pad prism 4 software (CA, USA) differences in pre-booster vaccina- tion values and post-booster vaccination values to evalu- ate the PsC specific response were analysed using t-test of graph pad prism 4 software (CA, USA). 3.

WJV 80 taken at different ages, anti PL serum IgG responses were detectable in children un- der one year old (infants and toddlers). Serum bactericidal activities against both B and C se- rogroups were over 25% in almost all age groups except before the first dose and at 5 and 7 months ( Figure 1(e) ). No significant level in IgA antibody against serogroups B and C was detected in either one of the age groups (data not shown). Overall VA-MENGOC-BC \u00ae induces strong immune response against both PL and PsC com- ponents in the first year of life. This is especially relevant for the Ps antigen, because it is known that unconjugated Ps antigens are not immunogenic in infants. Levels of anti PL specific IgG increased significantly (p < 0.001) after the primary and secondary immuniza- tions of infants ( Figure 1(a) ). Remarkably, similar be- haviour but with lower titers of anti PsC specific IgG response was observed in serum ( Figure 1(b) ). Anti PL IgM was detectable after the fi rst vaccination dose and it is maintained in all groups at least in the first year. However, anti PsC IgM was detected after the primary immunization but it remains near of the cut off value until 11 months ( Figures 1(c) and (d)). We did not detect any levels of anti PL or anti PsC serum IgG or IgM be- fore the vaccine first dose ( Figure 1 ). 3.2. VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae Induces a Long-Lasting Response Twelve months after the 2 doses of VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae applied at 3 and 6 - 7 months respectively, the anti PL ( a ) ( b ) 1. Serum IgG, IgM, and bactericidal specific responses to vaccination with meningococcal vaccine in the first year of life.

Arrows represent first (3.5 mont hs) and second (5 months) vaccination doses of the bivalent (serogroups (b) and (c)) meningococcal vaccine, VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae. The broken line means cut off value. Proteoliposome and Polysaccharide-Based Me ningococcal Vaccine Are Immunogenic in Infants and Toddlers and Primes for Memory against Serogroup C Polysaccharide 81 IgG as well as anti PL IgM response was positive to all infants. Even when we evaluated anti PL IgG and IgM response until 15 years old, all children and teenagers showed positive values for both classes of antibodies (Figures 2(a) and (c)). However, anti PsC IgG was tran- sitory and it was negative or near to cut off value in chil- dren up to age 15 ( Figure 2(b) ). Nevertheless, the pres- ence of anti PsC IgM obse rved in these age groups (Figure 2(c) ). Overall, a long-lasting immune response was induced which is more potent against the PL vaccine component. 3.3. VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae Changes the Subclasses Pattern Induced by a Plain Polysaccharide Vaccine The IgG subclass distribution of antibodies against PL and PsC from N. meningitidis in child vaccinees was evaluated. Anti PL IgG 1 predominated after immuniza- tion followed by IgG3 and it was observed in all groups in the first year of life after the first dose ( Figure 3(a) ). Vaccinated infants maintained the same anti PL IgG 1 specific response from 2 to 15 years. Also, the presence of anti PL IgG 3 was observed in children older than 3 years old ( Figure 3(c) ). In contrast, anti PsC IgG 4 IgG 3 subclasses predominated in the response to PsC and anti PsC IgG 1 were only induced until 2 years after vac- cination ( Figures 3(b) and (d)). The plain Ps A + C vac- cine mainly induced antibodies of IgG 2 subclass against PsC (classic subclass response against plain Ps) which was never observed against PL or PsC after VA-MENGOC- BC \u00ae vaccination ( Figure 3(e) ). Overall, anti PL and PsC subclasses were dominated by IgG 1 and IgG 4/ IgG 3, respectively. The later pattern is completely dif- ferent to that induce by plain Ps vaccines. 3.4. VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae Induces Polysaccharide Immunological Response after a 3rd Dose or to Natural Neisseria Challenge Teenagers were boosted with a 3rd dose of VA-MEN- GOC-BC\u00ae which contain non covalent conjugated PsC from N. meningitidis serogroup C. All subjects showed a significant increase in anti PsC IgG response (P < 0.0001) and even those without a response before boost serocon- verted in the anti PsC IgG response ( Figure 4(a) ). The effect of a natural challenge on the anti PsC response was assessed by comparing anti PsC IgG responses in carriers of N. meningitidis serogroup C versus non-carriers. No significant difference in anti PsC IgG response was ob- served between carriers and non-carriers. ( Figure 4(b) ). Overall, neither the third vaccine dose nor natural Neis- seria challenge impaired the PsC IgG response. (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure. 2.

Immunization of Infants with VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae Induces Immune Responses against the Proteins from Serogroup B and the Polysaccharide from Serogroup C The Cuban National Immunization Program is aimed at total coverage of children and at risk populations. The current vaccine schedule targ ets all children against 13 diseases for immunization with 11 vaccines. Conse- quently, in the particular case of N. meningitidis B and C all the population less than 22 years old are vaccinated with VA-MENGOC-BC \u00ae because they were born after 1991 when this vaccine was introduced in the national program of vaccination. In addition, several million sub- jects were vaccinated during ph ase III clinical trial or in national campaigns before 1991. For those reasons, by taking serum samples from babies attending a paediatric hospital laboratory, we have the certainty that those sam- ples came from a vaccinated person; also the vaccination schedule of each subject was recorded. With this study, ( a ) ( b ) IgG specific subclasses responses to vaccination with meningococcal vaccine. Each age group of n sera came from 388 vaccinated infants (63), toddlers (88), children (136), pre-teenagers and teenager (55), and young adults (46) who were vaccinated during the na tional immunization schedul e when they were 3.5 mo nths of age with anti-Neisseria meningiti- dis BC vaccine, VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae. Fifteen additional young adul ts were vaccinated with one dose of the A + C plain poly- saccharide vaccine (Paste ur Merieux Connaught): (a) N. ) IgG classes under the of one; (PsC from serogroup C ) IgG age of one; (c) Anti PL IgG subclasses from 2 to 15 years old; (d) Anti PsC IgG subclasses from 2 to 15 years old; and (e) Anti PsC IgG subclasses of 15 subjects vaccinated with A Cop yright \u00a9 2013 Are Immunogenic in Infants and Toddlers and Primes for Memory against Serogroup C Polysaccharide 83 Days carrier Carrier0100020003000400050006000 B IgG antibody- ies. Each sera came from teenagers or young adults who were vaccinated during the nati onal immunization schedule when they were 3.5 and 5 months of age with anti- Neisseria meningitidis BC vaccine, VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae: (a) meningitidis of sera from 15 teenager evaluated before (T0) and 21 (T21) days after a third dose of meningococcal vaccine, VA- MENGOC-BC\u00ae; and (b) Anti PsC IgG titers of sera from 46 young adults samples and their relationship with Neisse- ria carrier stage. we are also indirectly evalua ting the efficiency of this vaccination program. Unfortunate, at that time the PsC conjugated vaccine was not available for this study and direct comparison with infant vaccinated with covalently conjugated vaccines can not be performed. In order to know, if the two main antigens (PL and PsC) of VA-MENGOC-BC \u00ae were immunogenic when the vaccination is started very early in life (3.5 months of age), we measured the serum specific antibody responses (IgG, IgM, and IgG subclasses) from infants before (<3.5 months of age), during (3.5 - 5 months of age) and im- mediately after vaccination (8 months), and in toddlers from 8 to 12 months of age. Anti PL IgG responses were positive after the first dose with a substantial increase in titers and were positive in all the age groups evaluated. An early immune response to PsC was also seen, which was positive in all age groups evaluated. Transplacental passage of IgG from vaccinated mothers may explain the presence of low titres of anti PL antibodies prior to vac- cination. For this reason, th e primary specific IgM anti- body response was also measured and it was negative excluding the possibility of na tural contact before vacci- nation at least in the evaluated infant sera. 4.2. VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae Induces a Long-Lasting Response against Both Vaccine Components In order to determine whether VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae primes for immunological memory after the vaccination when they were infants, we meas ured the serum specific IgG and IgM responses from children (from 2 to 15 years old). Specific antibodies after infant immunization against PL persisted until at least 15 years of age, although anti-PsC antibody response in this age range was lower. However, anti PsC antibody response persistence was sustained until 2 years old. The most common way of evaluating memory is to challenge the population with a booster dose. Neverthe- less, in areas where natural exposure is frequent, we can assume that this acts as a booster dose. However, a natu- ral boosting, either by the homologous organisms or by cross-reactive organisms, is difficult to document. To this end, the anti PL IgM response was tested, because this response is low and transitory as a consequence of the short antibody isotype half-life. The presence of anti PL and anti PsC IgM antibodies would therefore indicate a recent natural contact, rather than a more long-lasting response induced by vaccinati on. In addition, the absence of IgG anti PsC antibodies in children over 2 years old which have anti PsC IgM antibodies suggests possibility of natural contact with cross-reactive organisms rather than contact with N. meningitidis serogroup C. 4.3. VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae Changes the Subclasses Pattern of Plain Polysaccharide Vaccine The induction of anti PL IgG 1 antibodies by VA-MEN- GOC-BC\u00ae has been previously described [21]; we now further report the induction of specific IgG 3 antibodies later in life which may be stimulated by natural contact. Any way, both IgG 1 and IgG 3 in human are coming form a cellular Th1 pattern which was postulated by our group in 2001 [16]. Changes in the IgG 1/IgG 2 ratio following vaccination can indicate the ac tivation of cellular control mechanisms typical of a T- cell-dependent immune re- sponse. The rise in IgG 2 may indicate a T-cell-inde- pendent response [24]. Anti PsC IgG 4, IgG 3, and IgG 1 antibodies were also induce d by this vaccination, how- ever IgG 1 response detected was transitory. As expected, Copyright \u00a9 2013 SciRes. WJV Proteoliposome and Polysaccharide-Based Me ningococcal Vaccine Are Immunogenic in Infants and Toddlers and Primes for Memory against Serogroup C Polysaccharide 84 plain Ps vaccine preferentially induced the IgG 2 antibody subclass, a fact that has been documented in previous reports [25-28]. IgG 4 does not activate the classical com- plement pathway but could be important in vivo in phagocytosis or alternative pathway activation [29]. The differences observed in subclasses anti PsC responses indicate that VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae can modulate the re- sponse to the non covalently incorporated PsC. Also, it is important to remember that this vaccine is adsorbed onto Al(OH) 3 and that PL-containing LPS is the most impor- tant Th1 driver present in this vaccine [23] and could certainly influence the response against the PsC incorpo- rated in it. 4.4. VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae Induces Polysaccharide Immunological Responses after a Third Dose or to Natural Neisseria Challenge In order to determine the priming immune response by VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae we determined the response to a 3rd dose or to natural N. meningitidis challenge. In the for- mer, the anti PsC IgG responses were observed in 100% of the 20 vaccinated teenag ers. Previous studies have concluded that the administra tion of plain meningococcal Ps vaccine to young childre n induces a hyporesponsive state to meningococcal Ps [30]. Keyserling et al. showed that the response for serogrou p C of subjects vaccinated 3 years earlier with a tetrav alent Ps vaccine was lower than those who previously received a tetravalent conju- gate vaccine [31]. Interestingly, we obtained a signifi- cantly higher serogroup C response after a third dose of VA-MENGOBC TM in teenagers vaccinated during infant life. Unfortunately, we could not include a covalent con- jugated vaccine to determine the induction or not of hy- poresponsiveness. In the latter group, consisting of 46 young adults with 32.6% being Neisseria carriers, the anti PsC response was observed in 84.8% of the cases and 11/15 carriers had significant anti PsC IgG antibodies. Unfortunately, we only detected the genera and neither the species nor the serogroup. Before natural challenge, anti PsC IgM antibodies were presented in many cases (data not shown). These results are consis tent with the fact that we have predominance of N. meningitidis serogroup B carri- ers. Indeed, pe rformed showed that circu- lation of serogroup C was only rarely detected in Cuba (I Mart\u00ednez, personal communication). Nevertheless, the anti PsC IgG responses suggest that some serogroup C N. meningitidis strains are circulating, and the presence of circulating antibodies play a key role in protection against the disease [31]. It is not clear whether plain PsC vaccines which in- duce hyporesponsiveness would perhaps affect suscepti- bility to meningococcal C diseas e in the long term [19]. It is therefore important to note that the incidence of N. meningitidis serogroup C disease did not increase in Cuba following VA-MENGOC-BC \u00ae vaccination. It is necessary to point out that the Cuban population under 40 years of age is vaccinated with this vaccine, and all those under 22 years old were vaccinated when they were infants. Therefore, susceptibility to serogroup C has not increased, thereby excluding the possibility of immu- nological hyporesponsiveness induced by VA-MEN- vac- cines [19]. Certainly, the induction of hyporesponsive- the lower specific IgG and bactericidal re- sponses but not that these responses are under the level of protec- tion. Theses results suggest that the formulation of PsC and PL adsorbed onto AL(OH) 3, as a non covalent combina- tion, primes the immune system in a different way to the plain Ps. The other immunopotentiator (adjuvant) present in the vaccine is the lipopol ysaccharide (LPS). The small amounts presented are incorporated into the vesicles and not free. The LPS that remained was strongly associated with membrane, probably accounting for its lower toxic- ity. A previous work showed that membrane associated LPS after detergent treatment reduced endotoxicity and induced IFN production [32] which is in agreement with the preferential cellular, Th 1 pattern induced by VA- MENGOC-BC \u00ae [15]. There are reasons of PsC in the vac- cine may be beneficial. On the one hand, B cells can produce Th1 cytokines, including IFN . Both B cells and NK cells are recruited by TI-2 an tigens; the latter can in turn activate B cells by direct in teraction with them [37]. Therefore, PsC may be contributing to the Th1 pattern induced by VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae. In addition, IFN and IL-2 could enhance the antibody response to TI antigens [38-40] by acting as B-cell growth and differentiation factors regulating B-cell maturation [41] and Ig class and subclass switching [42]. On the other hand, it has been reported that the time at which IFN exerts its effect may be critical, since the stimulatory effect of IFN on Ig se- cretion in vitro is maximal when its addition is delayed, even by as little as 24 h [9]. We have previously reported that when peripheral mo nonuclear cells from VA- MENGOC-BC \u00ae immunised subjects were re-stimulated in vitro with PL, a delayed IFN response was observed [16]. This may explain the good results of the combina- tion of PL and PsC and the other immunopetentiators present in VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae. Furthermore it must be observed that the bactericidal activity in sera of infants and toddlers less than one year old was only observed after vaccination, with the highest percentage after the first and second doses. These bacte- Cop Are Immunogenic in Infants and Toddlers and Primes for Memory against Serogroup C Polysaccharide 85 ricidal activities are similar fo r both vaccine components. It is important to note that this bactericidal activity does not mean seroconversion beca use only one serum sample was evaluated. These bactericidal activities are not as high as that induce by Ps co valently conjugated vaccines [43]; but that a formulation of non covalently Th-2 PsC induced long-lasting immune response and memory, changed the subclass pattern, and induced bactericidal activity similar than against the protein component of this vaccine is a relevant fact. In conclusion, these studies provide evidences that a non covalently conjugated vaccine can be immunogenic and protective in infants agai nst the TI antigen, induces detectable levels of bactericidal activity, primes for memory, and might not induce hyporesponsiveness after a repeated administration aspect that need to be deeper explored.
