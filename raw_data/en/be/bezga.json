Forty-eight rabbits, aged 4 weeks, were randomly assigned to four groups (4 replications of 3 rabbits / replicate) as follows: BD group (control); AFB1 group (supplemented with AFB1 0.3 mg/kg diet); MEO-supplemented group (1 g MEO/kg diet); AFB1 + MEO group (AFB1 0.3 mg/kg diet + 1 g MEO/kg diet). AFB1 exposure resulted in reduction of rabbit growth and total protein and albumin content in serum; increased liver function related enzymes (ALP, ALT and AST); induced oxidative stress displayed by lower level of antioxidant enzymes (CAT and GSH), increased biomarkers of DNA and lipid oxidative damage with significant upregulation of the tumor suppressor protein interferon-, interleukin 1, tumor necrosis factor-  and heat shock protein-70 when compared to the control (P < 0.05). Moreover, exposure to AFB1 increased the bioaccumulation of AFB1 residues in rabbit liver. Supplementation of MEO in the AFB1-exposed rabbits alleviated all of its negative effects. In conclusion, dietary addition of 1 g MEO could effectively ameliorate the adverse impacts of AFB1 on rabbit growth; enhanced their antioxidants and reduced oxidative stress and inflammatory response indicators,", "sitename": "Annals of Animal Science", "date": "2023-05-12", "cleaned_text": "determination of total aflatoxins and ochratoxins A in meat products by immuno-affinity fluorimetry.
