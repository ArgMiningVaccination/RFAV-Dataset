Abstract A rich economic literature has examined the human capital impacts of disease- eliminating health interventions, such as the rollout of new vaccines. This literature is based on reduced- form approaches which exploit proxies for disease burden, such as mortality, instead of actual infection counts, which are difficult to measure. The researchers develop an epidemiological dynamic accounting model based on the susceptible -infected - recovered (SIR) framework to derive precise measles infection shares across U.S. cohorts born around the introduction of the measles vaccine. Measles is highly infectious and fully immunizing which makes the disease an ideal candidate for epidemiological modeling. The authors ' epidemiological model is strongly predictive of future measles outbreaks, but the derived measles infection shares are not systematically related to cohorts ' later educational, economic, or health outcomes. The r educed- form approach, on the other hand, shows that these long-term outcomes strongly improved among vaccinated cohorts in states with high pre- vaccine measles mortality. The researchers ' results suggest that differences in disease severity are more relevant for long-term human capital impacts than raw differences in actual infection rates, supporting the reduced- form approach used in the economic literature.

But there has been limited use outside the current pandemic context, despite a rich and well-established literature in economics studying the impacts of disease spread on human capital accumulation and economic long-term outcomes.1Papers from this literature typically use reduced-form approaches that exploit public health interventions with a focus on the general severity of the pre-intervention disease environment, which is often proxied by pre-intervention mortality. But mortality might be a suboptimal proxy to measure a disease's long-term e ects in the surviving population. Epidemiological models, in comparison, have the advantage that they can account for actual infection rates across cohorts. In this paper, we develop an epidemiological accounting model to compare the two approaches analyzing the long-term impacts of measles surrounding the measles vaccine introduction to the United States in the early 1960s. Measles provide a useful context to assess the value of epidemiological modeling for the analysis of the economic consequences of disease spread. First, while measles infections can lead to immediate serious illness, they are also understood to partially eliminate previously obtained immunity to other childhood diseases leading to higher incidence of non-measles disease after a measles infection (Gadroen et al., 2018; Mina et al., 2015, 2019; Petrova et al., 2019). This impact on secondary infections makes measles spread an important driver of childhood sickness, with the potential of long-term consequences for human capital development (Atwood, 2022; Driessen et al., 2015; Nandi et al., 2019). Second, measles is extremely infectious with an R0 of 16 or higher (Guerra et al., 2017) and it is fully immunizing.2The high 1See, for example, Acemoglu and Johnson al. Lucas (2010). 2R0 refers to the number of people infected by a single contagious individual in a fully 2infectiousness implies that in an unvaccinated, fully susceptible population virtually everyone will be infected during the rst years of life. Hence there is no socio-economic selection into infections and variation in infection rates at a given point in time are largely driven by the recent location-speci c outbreak history. Moreover, the full immunization allows for better epidemi- ological accounting and a more precise assignment of observed cases across population groups. In sum, measles is understood to be a central driver of severe childhood sickness and is relatively easily accountable, providing a good case for the use of epidemiological modeling to measure the long-term human capital impacts of disease spread. Our analysis relies on measles case counts between 1950 and 1980 that are available at the state level but without age information. We combine these counts with demographic data on births and population sizes to build an epidemiological dynamic accounting model which distributes observed cases across cohorts in each state. We show that the resulting measles distribu- tions are highly predictive of future outbreaks in line with epidemiological Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered (SIR) models, corroborating the mechan- ics of our accounting framework. In contrast, the economic reduced-form ap- proach using pre-intervention measles mortality rates has no predictive power of year-to-year outbreaks. We then use the accounting model to calculate the shares in each birth cohort that have ever been infected with measles. Fi- nally, we estimate the impact of measles on long-term outcomes measured in the Census and the American Community Survey (ACS) comparing the epidemiological modeling approach and the reduced-form approach. Linking outcomes in adulthood to measles infections in early childhood measured by the baseline epidemiological accounting model indicates strongly negative impacts on a broad range of adult outcomes. Cohorts with lower shares of people ever infected with measles have lower high school dropout rates, higher family income, and are less dependent on welfare income and susceptible population. 3food stamps. However, the variation in measles infection shares identifying these e ects largely covaries with overall cohort trends and these estimated long-term e ects are not robust to the inclusion of cohort xed e ects. The economic reduced-form approach, on the other hand, yields similar estimates as the baseline epidemiological model and is fully robust to controlling exibly for cohort trends. The reduced form approach also has more predictive power of medium-term cohort mortality. Focusing on the reduced-form approach, we extend the analysis to health outcomes that are observed in the ACS. We nd positive impacts of measles reductions on a broad set of physical health di\u000eculties, including work dis- ability and di\u000eculties with daily physical functioning. Overall, our analysis suggests that the severity of the disease environment is a central factor determining early life impacts that persist throughout the life course { variation that is captured by the reduced-form approach. Dif- ferences in overall infection rates captured by the epidemiological approach that do not account for the severity of the disease burden are less consistently associated with long-term outcomes. Notably, the epidemiological model per- forms well in predicting year-to-year uctuations in measles cases but this variation is not the relevant margin for impacts on child development. Given its extremely high contagiousness and full immunization, measles provide an upper bound for the power of epidemiological modeling to mea- sure the long-term e ects of disease spread. Diseases that spread less aggres- sively or infect people numerous times over their lifetime, such as in uenza or COVID-19, are much more di\u000ecult to model. Our analysis therefore pro- vides strong support for the use of reduced-form approaches that focus on the severity of the disease environment when measuring the long-term bene ts of disease reduction (Acemoglu and Johnson, 2007; et al., 2010; Lazuka, 2020; Lucas, 2010). We discuss these approaches in more detail in 4Section 3.2. Our results further contribute to a concentrated economic and public health literature that has focused on the human capital consequences of measles infections. Our reduced-form results are strongly in line with Atwood (2022) who studies the long-term e ects of the measles vaccine introduction in the United States using a similar reduced-form approach (see Section 3.2 for a more detailed discussion). Positive long-term e ects of measles vaccina- tion have also been found for developing countries, such as Ethiopia, India, Vietnam, and Bangladesh (Driessen et al., 2015; Nandi et al., 2019). Finally, our ndings are relevant for policies aimed at increasing vacci- nation rates in low-income countries and maintaining high coverage in high- income countries (B\u007f arnighausen et al., 2014b; Bloom et al., 2021; Nandi et al., 2020). Our analysis suggests that, from a child development perspective, vaccination e orts are particularly bene cial in contexts with high measles and childhood mortality { conditions that are nowadays mostly found in de- veloping countries. At the same time, measles outbreaks in high-incomes context can be very disruptive reducing the educational inputs of those who fall sick and among healthy students if schools have to shut down to con- tain outbreaks.3Overall, our analysis emphasizes the central role of measles vaccination for child development around the world. 2 Data Our analysis draws on several data sets. The rst set of data concerns the input parameters for the epidemiological and the reduced-form models. Our epidemiological model is based on measles counts from weekly U.S. \\noti able diseases\" reports obtained from Project Tycho (Van Panhuis et al., 2013) 3For news reports on recent school closures in response to measles outbreaks, see, for example: www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/nyregion/measles-nyc-yeshiva-closing.html and www.sciencealert.com/the-clark-county-measles-outbreak-is-now-forcing-hundreds-of- kids-to-miss-school. 5and linked to the Vital Statistics birth counts (Bailey et al., 2016). For vaccination rates in the introduction period we rely on the U.S.-wide numbers provided by Orenstein and Hinman (1999) and Orenstein et al. (2004). The reduced-form approach, instead, is based on measles mortality data from the Vital Statistics (National Center for Health Statistics, 1959{1978). The second set of data informs about our outcomes. Speci cally, we rely on the US Census records in 2000 and the American Community Survey (ACS) in the years 2001{2019 (Ruggles et al., 2015) for long-term human capital accumulation of individuals born from 1950{1980. 2.1 Measles counts, birth, and mortality data Measles counts. The Project Tycho data (Van Panhuis et al., 2013) provide weekly reports of all nationally noti able diseases for U.S. cities and states from 1888 to 2011. For the case of measles, the data contain weekly state-level counts of measles cases and incidence rates per 100,000 inhabitants between 1928 to 2003, summing up to a total of 18,670,996 reported individual cases. Figure 1 plots weekly incidence rates for the overall United States over time, with the red dashed line indicating 1963, the year the measles vaccine was rst introduced. As it can be seen, a large outbreak occurred in 1964, but incidence rates quickly dropped in the following years reaching low levels close to zero in 1968. Only very small annual outbreaks are observed between 1970 and 1980, while there are zero reported measles cases in most weeks after 1980 with only a few isolated small spikes in the following two decades. Figure 2 plots annual measles incidence rates across all 51 U.S. states. There are three important observations. First, average incidence levels in the period before the vaccine introduction are very di erent across states, suggesting that there might be large di erences in reporting rates. Second, the timing of measles outbreaks (peak years) is di erent across states. Third, while most states experience a strong reduction in incidence rates around the introduction of the vaccine, there is considerable variation in the year when 6the last visible outbreak occurred. Birth data. To build an epidemiological dynamic accounting model which distributes observed measles cases across cohorts in each state, we also need demographic data on births. Therefore, we rely on US county-level natality data starting in 1915 provided by Bailey et al. (2016) and aggregate these data to the state level. Mortality data. For the economic reduced-form approach, instead, we need measles mortality data. We therefore use individual-level death counts at the state-level containing information on the cause of death from 1959 to 1979 from the National Vital Statistics System National Center for Health Statistics.4 2.2 Long-term human capital and health outcomes Long-term human capital data. The 2000 Census and the American Commu- nity Surveys from 2001{2019 (Ruggles et al., 2015) provide information on the demographics, educational attainment, labor market outcomes, welfare dependency, and long-run health status. Demographic information contains the birthplace as well as the year of birth.5This information is crucial in order to align individuals with the level of the treatment (state and year of birth). Educational information is measured by the respondents' highest year of school or degree completed. We then construct a high school completion dummy indicating, whether an individual has nished the 12th grade or more. As economic and labor market outcomes, we include respondents' employment status in the week prior to the survey as well as log household income (in real 2010 U.S. dollars). 4The cause of death is recorded according to the International Classi cation of Diseases (ICD) Revision 7 in the years 1959{1967 and Revision 8 for the years 1968{1979. 5The year of birth has been calculated by subtracting age from the survey year intro- ducing an important source of measurement error (the 2000 Census takes place on April 1, while the ACS is administered throughout the year). 7We also construct three binary measures representing welfare dependency, indicating (1) household income below the federal poverty line (2) receipt of welfare income at the individual level, and (3) receipt of food stamps at the family level. Health outcomes. The Census and the ACS include two types of measures of respondents' health status: a binary variable indicating work disability (only available up to 2007), and a set of ve disability questions (reporting cognitive, ambulatory, independent living, self-care, and vision or hearing complications) that we summarize in an equally weighted disability index. Finally, in order to test our two models against each other for a measure where we have good theoretical predictions, we also study mortality as an outcome. In this analysis, we calculate two versions of mortality rates per 1,000 births by cumulating measles speci c and overall deaths for the ages 0 to 5 for each speci c birth cohort and diving by the number of births of the respective birth cohort.6 2.3 Sample restrictions and descriptive statistics We restrict our sample to individuals born from 1950 to 1980 in the United States, excluding Alaska, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Wyoming which are ex- cluded due to missing data in birth counts (Alaska and Hawaii), measles mor- tality data (Delaware, District of Columbia, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Wyoming), or measles incidence data (Massachusetts). With these restriction we yield a sample of 21,473,682 observations. The 2000 Census is a 5% sample of the US population and therefore contributes the most with 4,912,526 observations. The 2001{2004 ACS capture around 394,000 observations each year. Finally, the ACS from 2005{2019 are a 1- 6Using this measure as an outcome reduces our number of observations drastically, as (1) our cells are then on the level of state-of-birth x year-of birth and as (2) we can only include birth cohorts 1959{1973 due to data availability. 8in-100 national random sample of the population and contribute with an average of around 1 million observations each year to our total sample. For our analysis, we aggregate the data to cells at the state-of-birth x year-of-birth x age level as treatment in terms of early disease environment occurs at the state- and year-of-birth level. This aggregation results in 25,400 cells. Table 1 reports the descriptive statistics for the entire sample and the sub-samples divided into decades. 3 Approaches and empirical strategy 3.1 Epidemiological dynamic distribution model In this section we develop a dynamic distribution model based on the SIR framework that distributes all measles counts observed across states and years across cohorts de ned by birth year and state. The goal is to calculate the ratio of infections to cohort size which represents the share of a cohort that has ever been infected by measles. If data were available on all measles infections including age information, calculating cohorts' share of ever infected individuals would be trivial. But, as typically the case for infectious disease data, reporting of measles infections in the analyzed time period was not complete and no information on the age at infection is available. We therefore rst need to estimate states' reporting rates to obtain estimates of the total number of infections in a given state in a given year. Second, we need to know how many susceptible individuals, who have not been infected with measles before, remain in each cohort in each year. Our notation follows a discrete model with time units representing years and cohorts aging by one year each period. 93.1.1 Reporting rate estimation In the pre-vaccination era we can roughly assume that everyone is infected with measles eventually (Finkenst\u007f adt and Grenfell, 2000). This implies that cumulative measles cases approximately equal cumulative births (Finkenst\u007f adt and Grenfell, 2000). We follow the existing literature and choose to link births to measles cases focussing on the pre-vaccination years 1950{1960. The slope of the regression of cases on births then represents the reporting rate (see Figure A1 for an illustration in the case of Oklahoma). Figure 3 shows the distribution of the estimated reporting rate across states. A signi cant share of states has reporting rates below 10% and the top state has a rate of 38%. The average reporting rate across states is 13%. Overall, this shows that reporting is fairly low and heterogeneous across states, emphasizing the im- portance accounting for these di erences. Appendix Figure A2 shows the spatial distribution of reporting rates across the United States. Reporting rates seem somewhat lower in the South (with the exception of Texas) than in the North, in particular the North-East. But there is no strong spatial pattern. We can modify the reporting rate (e.g. by taking doubling the rate or cutting it in half) or the shape of the reporting rate (linear or changing over time) without changing the main results in a qualitative way. 3.1.2 Distributing cases across cohorts Next, we need to distribute the total number of cases (reported cases divided by the reporting rate) across cohorts. We assume that every person can only get infected once and that the risk of infection is independent of an individual's age conditional on prior infection status.7Hence, infections in a given state and year are distributed across cohorts based on each cohort's 7This implies that cases are equally distributed across all susceptibles in a state regard- less of their age. However, more cases will be distributed to younger ages as the share of susceptibles decreases with age. We can modify the assumption of age-independent infec- tion risk, e.g. by assigning higher risks to younger individuals. The main results remain qualitatively unchanged. 10share of total (t) reportingrate, (2) wheretandarefer to year and age, respectively, and the total infections I(t) correspond to the ratio of reported cases divided by the estimated reporting rate. Unvaccinated cohorts become fully susceptible at age 1 when they lose maternal immunization (Sato et al., 1979)8while vaccination is modeled as a reduction in the number of births (Keeling and Rohani, 2011): births( t)\u0002[1\u0000vaccination(t + 1)] if age=1. (3) After age 1, the stock of susceptibles within a cohort follows the following simple law of motion: S(t+ 1;a+ 1) =S(t;a)\u0000I(t;a) if age>1. (4) Finally, our dynamic distribution model needs to start in some period, and in this initial period we do not know the number of susceptibles re- maining in cohorts that are older than 1, as infections in prior years are not observed. Our initial time period (1935) lies in the pre-vaccination era and we can approximate the share of susceptibles across age groups by average 8For a review on passive transmission of antibodies against measles in newborns see Leuridan and Van Damme (2007). Interestingly, immunization duration di ers for new- borns from mothers who naturally acquired measles or mothers who acquired antibodies vaccine-induced . While in our model we rely on passive immunization from mothers who were naturally infected, women vaccinated with live attenuated measles vaccine generally pass on shorter protection against measles to their children up to the age of 8 months (Lennon and Black, 1986). 11susceptibility curves (AS (a)) from pre-vaccination era studies, calibrated to match an overall population susceptibility rate of 2.5 percent (Orenstein et al., 1985).9Hence, susceptibles across age in the initial period are determined S(t= 1;a) = pop(t= 1;a)\u0003AS(a) (5) 3.1.3 Calculating cohorts' share ever infected Having distributed all infections across cohorts, we then sum up infections over time within each cohort and divide by cohort size. This then gives us the share of individuals ever infected. We run the model at the state level though we use U.S.-wide vaccination rates as there is no state-level data on the vaccine rollout. For a graphical overview of states' share ever infected see Appendix Figure A3. 3.2 Economic \\reduced-form\" approach A rich and prominent literature in economics has accumulated evidence that the early life disease environment has strong and persistent impacts on the population's human capital accumulation. Studies from that literature have in common that they typically identify the long-term e ects of disease spread by exploiting some type of health intervention or sudden society-wide health improvement and interacting it with a measure of baseline disease exposure (often mortality). These approaches typically are build on a version of the following regression model Ys;c= + (Tpre c\u0002Pre s) +\u0012s+\u000ec+\u000fs;c, (6) 9In the study by Orenstein et al. (1985), the data covers the pre-vaccine era from three di erent locations and dates. Results are all basically identical, so that there is no reason to suspect that that pro le would look much di erent for any other location or time in the pre-vaccine era. 12wheresrefers to state (or region, or country), cis the birth cohort (or simply time), Pre sis a proxy of the disease exposure (e.g. mortality) during the pre-intervention, Tpre cis a dummy for the pre-intervention period, and \u0012sand\u000ecare state and cohort xed e ects. Prominent economic studies using such an approach are, among others, Acemoglu and Johnson (2007), Ager et al. (2018), Bhalotra and Venkatara- mani (2015), Bleakley (2007), Bleakley (2010), and Salvanes (2020), Cutler et al. (2010), Egedes et al. (2020), Jayachandran et al. (2010), Lazuka (2020), and Lucas (2010). For instance, Acemoglu and Johnson (2007) interact major international health improvements in the 1940s with pre-1940 mortality rates from 15 lead- ing infectious diseases to study life expectancy on economic performance. Bleakley (2007), more speci cally, combines pre-eradication distribution of hookworm disease with the hookworm-eradication campaign to show the ben- e cial impact on education while Bleakley (2010), Cutler et al. (2010) and Lucas (2010) obtain plausible exogenous variation in child health by relying on malaria eradication in the US, India, or Paraguay and Sri Lanka to study the impact on adult labor market outcomes, consumption, and educational attainment. In the same vein Ager et al. (2018) combine pre-vaccination variation in smallpox mortality across Swedish counties with the introduction of the smallpox vaccine, while B\u007f utikofer and Salvanes (2020) and Egedes et al. (2020) interact tuberculosis infection rates and mortality with tuberculosis testing and vaccination in Norway and tuberculosis dispensaries in Danish cities, respectively. Finally, Bhalotra and Venkataramani (2015), Jayachan- dran et al. (2010), and Lazuka (2020) exploit the introduction of sulfa drugs, a medical innovation that reduced exposure to pneumonia in infancy, inter- acted with pre-innovation pneumonia mortality to examine the long-term impacts on educational and labor market outcomes of a ected cohorts. In recent contemporaneous work, Atwood (2022) examines the long-run 13e ects of measles vaccination on earnings and employment interacting the measles vaccine introduction with pre-vaccine levels of reported measles in- cidence. The long-term e ects reported in Atwood (2022) are qualitatively and quantitatively very close to the e ects we estimate despite our use of pre-vaccine measles mortality rather than pre-vaccine measles incidence in our baseline economic reduced-form approach. The similarity of our esti- mates suggests that, in the case of measles, reported incidence rates are a good proxy for disease severity and mortality. Exceptions in terms of their empirical designs are provided by Driessen et al. (2015) and Nandi et al. (2019), who study measles vaccination impacts on child development in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, and Vietnam. Driessen et al. (2015) exploit a slow, staggered roll-out of the measles vaccine across di erent areas in Bangladesh allowing to study an area acting as a control group while only being treated several years after. Nandi et al. (2019) exploit quasi-experimental variation in vaccine coverage in low-income countries us- ing longitudinal data that includes information on vaccination status. While these designs are not feasible in most developed countries where vaccine coverage is near universal and the initial roll-out has been fast, these stud- ies provide important evidence of positive vaccination impacts on a broad range of developmental outcomes, including child anthropometry, cognition, schooling enrolment, and test scores. In this paper, we base our reduced-form speci cation on the most com- mon approach used in the literature exploiting local di erences in measles mortality prior to the introduction of the vaccine interacted with the vac- cine roll-out. Speci cally, measles mortality the age groups 0{5 averaged across the years 1959{1963 and interact them with the introduction of the measles vaccine in the United States. States individ- ual pre-vaccine mortality rates are scaled so that the overall average for the United States equals one. 143.3 Empirical strategy To examine the relationship between the early childhood disease environment and adult long-term outcomes, we estimate two types of linear regressions for age group ain birth cohort cin state of birth s. Speci cally, in case of the epidemiological model the equation follows: Ysca= + ShareEverInfected sc+ a+\u000ec+\u0012s+\u000fsca, (7) whereShareEverInfected scis the share of each cohort ever infected with measles derived from the epidemiological distribution model. For the reduced- form approach, we adjust Equation (7) to the following version: Ysca= + (Tpre (ages 0{5, in 1959{1963) andTpre cis a dummy equal to one for cohorts born in or prior to 1963, the year of the measles vaccine introduction. In both equations, Yscastands for the di erent averaged individual long- term outcomes, such as high school completion, employment status, total household income (in logarithmic terms), poverty status, receiving any wel- fare transfers or food stamps as well as health outcomes such as a disability status at work and a disability index comprised of impairments in 5 daily-life dimensions. Furthermore, we control for age, birth cohort, and state of birth xed e ects by a,\u000ec, and\u0012s, respectively. We also conduct an alternative speci cation where we control for cohort polynomials instead of cohort xed e ects. Our coe\u000ecient of interest is , representing the estimate of the e ect of measles exposure in early childhood. Standard errors are clustered at the state of birth level (Bertrand et al., 2004) and observations are weighted by cohort size. 15Combining both approaches, we also estimate a Bartik-type regression: Ysca= + (Pre s\u0002ShareEverInfected sc) + sis now multiplied with the ShareEverInfected sc. All other variables are de ned as above. Figure 4 shows the epidemiological \\share-ever-infected\" measure, the reduced-form measure, and the combined Bartik measure for ve selected states and averaged across the United States. As it can be seen, the variation in the epidemiological measure is driven entirely by the di erent timing in the reduction of infection shares. All states start with a share close to one and end with a share close to zero, but some states experience reductions earlier than others. The variation in the reduced-form measure, on the other hand, is entirely driven by pre-existing level di erences while the time variation is uniform across all states. The Bartik measure combines the two types of variations. 4 Results 4.1 Preditive power of epidemiological measure Before turning to our main results, we rst explore the predictive power of our dynamic distribution model. Our distribution model is based on the SIR framework that is centred around the key assumption that outbreaks are driven by susceptibles who drop out of the susceptible pool once they have been infected. A larger pool of susceptibles in one period therefore increases the risk of an outbreak in the following period. An outbreak in a given period, on the other hand, leads to a smaller pool of susceptibles in the following period. In Table 2 we test these predictions using state-speci c annual susceptible counts generated from our dynamic distribution model. The table shows coe\u000ecients from a regression of state-level measles counts 16on lags and leads of susceptible counts while controlling for state and year xed e ects. In line with the mechanics of the SIR model, lagged susceptible counts strongly predict measles outbreaks (column 1) while these outbreaks are strongly negatively related to susceptible counts in the subsequent period (column 2). Note that our dynamic distribution model generates suscepti- ble based on lagged measles outbreaks, hence the relationship in column (2) is mechanical. However, the information about future outbreaks does not feed into susceptible counts and therefore the result in column (1) shows the predictive power of the model. Column (3) shows the predictive power of the lagged susceptible measure when it is split into deciles. Columns (4{9) test the predictive power within subperiods of our data. Remarkably, our model is predictive of future outbreaks during the pre-vaccine era (columns 4{5), as well as during the period surrounding the introduction of the vac- cination (columns 6{7) and during the post-vaccine era when measles were largely eliminated and only idiosyncratic minor outbreaks occurred (columns 8{9). These results validate our model across three periods with very distinct measles environments. Appendix Table A1 compares the predictive power of the dynamic dis- tribution model to the reduced-form measure. As shown in column (3), the reduced form measure has no predictive power of future outbreaks and is also not correlated with lagged outbreaks. Moreover, since the measure only changes in the year of the measles introduction and the regressions include state xed e ects, the measures' impact cannot be estimated in the pre- and the post-vaccine era (columns 6 and 10). To sum up, our epidemiological distribution model generates a distribu- tion of measles cases that is highly predictive of measles outbreaks while the reduced-form measure is uncorrelated with year-to-year uctuations in measles cases. 174.2 Long-term e ects on human capital and health outcomes Figures 5{7 compare the epidemiological approach with the reduced-form approach as well as the combined Bartik approach in terms of the long-term impacts on human capital outcomes. The gures show regression coe\u000ecients based on Equations (7){(9), both for versions with cohort quadratic trends and cohort xed e ects. Corresponding numerical results are reported in Tables 3{5. The top left panel of Figure 5 plots the estimated e ects of early life measles exposure on high school completion. The darker colored bars show the estimates resulting from regressions including quadratic cohort trends and they indicate similar e ects across all three approaches. The coe\u000ecient for the epidemiological model is -0.539 with a standard error of 0.196 (Table 3, Panel A1, column 1), indicating that a cohort that has been fully exposed to measles early in life (ever infected share equals one) has a 0.54 percentage points lower high school completing rate than a cohort with zero exposure. The point estimate from the reduced form speci cation (Table 3, Panel B1, column 1), suggests that states with a pre-vaccination era measles mortality around the U.S. average at that time experienced a signi cant increase in high school completion of about 0.85 percentage points in response to the introduction of the vaccine. The Bartik speci cation (Table 3, Panel C1, column 1) which combines the two approaches results in a similar point estimate, indicating that decreasing the share of individuals ever infected with measles in a cohort from one to zero, in a state with the average pre- vaccination measles rate, signi cantly increases high school completion by 1.05 percentage points. When we control for cohort xed e ects instead of quadratic trends, the approaches based on the reduced-form measure result in very similar estimates (Table 3, Panels B2 and C2, column 1). The estimate from the epidemiological model (Table 3, Panel A2, column 1), however, ips sign and looses in signi cance when cohort xed e ects are included. 18The pattern for high school completion is observed similarly for log house- hold income, poverty, welfare income receipt, and food stamp receipt. In the speci cations with cohort trends all approaches indicate positive impacts of reducing measles exposure by improving these long-term outcomes. While the reduced form approach is robust to the inclusion of cohort xed e ects, the epidemiological modeling approach is, however, not. An exception is the unemployment rate which is not consistently a ected in the speci cations with cohort xed e ects. Figure 6 and Table 4 show the same set of regression results for health measures that are reported in the Census and ACS. Again the reduced- form and the Bartik approach result in very similar point estimates that are robust to the inclusion of cohort xed e ects, indicating negative long-term health consequences of early life measles exposure. For example, the reduced form speci cation with cohort xed e ects indicates that the measles vaccine introduction reduced work disability, cognitive disability, self-care disability, independent living di\u000eculties, and vision or hearing di\u000eculties by 0.8, 0.4, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.5 percentage points, respectively. Relative to the sample mean of these outcomes, the e ect sizes range between 8 and 12.8 percent. The epidemiological modeling approach, on the other hand, is not robust to the inclusion of di erent cohort e ects. Surprisingly, the approach results in signi cantly negative health impacts (i.e. a higher share of ever infected individuals is associated with less disability and fewer health di\u000eculties). The negative long-run impacts of early life measles exposure on human capital and health outcomes estimated via the reduced-form approach are in line with the long-term disease impacts known from the economic literature while it is more di\u000ecult to reconcile the estimates resulting from the epi- demiological modeling approach, especially the reverse health impacts. At the same time, the economic literature relies on similar reduced form ap- proaches, so the comparability of results does not provide an independent assessment. We therefore analyse two additional outcomes that are known 19to be directly linked to measles infection rates: Measles mortality and overall mortality in early childhood (ages 0{5). While measles mortality is obviously linked to measles infections, the epidemiological literature has argued that measles infections also increase the risk of childhood mortality from other diseases (Mina et al., 2015). Figure 7 (estimates reported in Table 5) shows that the reduced-form approach indeed indicates a signi cantly positive impact of higher disease exposure both on measles mortality and overall childhood mortality. The epidemiological model approach, on the other hand does not result in a sig- ni cant e ect for the cohort trends model while it indicates an implausible mortality reduction in response to higher measles infection shares when co- hort xed e ects are controlled for. Notice that the reduced-from measure is based on pre-vaccination measles mortality and therefore more directly linked to mortality changes. But there is no reasonable explanation why a cohort's share of individuals ever infected with measles should be negatively associated with childhood mortality. The mortality results therefore support the notion that the epidemiological modeling approach provides variation in measles infections that are di\u000ecult to disentangle from other factors driving cohort outcomes. 4.3 Alternative epidemiological modeling assumptions Finally, one might wonder to which extent the e ect patterns observed for the epidemiological approach depend on the assumptions built into the dynamic distribution model. Appendix Figure A5 plots the estimated impacts of the share ever infected on high school graduation and log household income across 12 models with varying alternative parameter speci cations. In particular, we vary the initial share of susceptibles in the population (S 0), we relax the assumption that infection rates among susceptibles are independent of age (assuming higher infection rates below age 6), and we allow for di erent functional forms when estimating the reporting function (default is the mean 20reporting rate, and we show results allowing for a linear time trend, a local polynomial trend (LOESS), and a spline function). As it can be seen in Figure A5, estimates are very similar across the di erent models and the inclusion of cohort xed e ects has a similar impact on the e ect pattern. These results suggest that the dynamic accounting model is not sensitive to the core assumptions. 5 Discussion and conclusion This paper uses an epidemiological modeling and an economic reduced-form approach to measure the long-term impacts of early-life measles exposure around the introduction of the measles vaccine in the United States. The reduced-form approach reveals large improvements in educational, labor mar- ket, and health outcomes in adulthood among cohorts born after the vaccine introduction in states with historically high measles mortality. No consistent e ect patterns are detected using the epidemiological modeling approach which exploits di erences in cohorts' share of individuals that were ever in- fected with measles. These results suggest that di erences in the severity of measles infections, proxied by measles mortality, matter more for long-term outcomes than the di erence in mere infection rates itself. The long-term impacts of early life measles exposure are in line with the economic literature that has documented, among others, long-term conse- quences of exposure to hookworm (Bleakley, 2010), malaria (Cutler et al., 2010; Lucas, 2010), and tuberculosis (B\u007f utikofer and Salvanes, 2020; Egedes et al., 2020). Our nding that the severity of the disease environment matters more than the measles infection rate itself is also in line with the notion that measles infections are particularly harmful for children as they can eliminate previously obtained immunity to other diseases (Gadroen et al., 2018; Mina et al., 2015, 2019; Petrova et al., 2019). This mechanism should matter most in a severe disease environment with high childhood mortality not only for 21measles but also other childhood diseases. Our estimated impacts are also very much in line with the contemporane- ous analysis of Atwood (2022). We nd that the introduction of the vaccine lead to a 2.7 percent increase in log total family income, a reduction of the poverty rate by 5.7 percent and a non-signi cant reduction of unemployment of 0.1 percent, while Atwood (2022) reports a family income increase of 1.7 percent, a poverty reduction of 7.3 percent, and an increase of 0.3 percent for employment. A key di erence in our approach is that we use pre-vaccine measles mortality as a proxy for disease burden while Atwood (2022) uses pre-vaccine measles cases that are not adjusted for reporting rate di erences. The similarity of our reduced-form estimates suggests that, at least in the context of the pre-vaccine United States, reporting rates can be used as a proxy for mortality and disease burden (presumably as more severe cases of measles were more likely to be reported). This insight further emphasizes that the epidemiological distribution model, which fully adjusts for di er- ences in reporting rates across locations, focuses on a very di erent margin. Despite the discovery of an e ective measles vaccine over half a century ago and its world-wide dissemination, measles outbreaks have been rising again over the past decade. The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to fur- ther increase vaccination hesitancy and the risk of future measles outbreaks (Roberts, 2020). Our analysis documents large life-long welfare gains among cohorts that bene ted from the introduction of the measles vaccine in the United States emphasizing the importance of a continued vaccination e ort (B\u007f arnighausen et al., 2014a; Bloom et al., 2018). However, our comparison of epidemiological and reduced-form approaches indicates that vaccination ben- e ts in terms of long-term human capital impacts are particularly large in en- vironments with severe childhood disease burdens. Our results are therefore particularly supportive of vaccination e orts in low-income countries with high childhood mortality (B\u007f arnighausen al., 2014b; Nandi et and Simon Johnson , \\Disease and development: The e ect of life expectancy on economic growth,\" Journal of Political Econ- omy, 2007, 115(6), 925{985.

Explanatoryvariables are the susceptibles in the years (t-1) and (t+1) as derived from the epidemiological (Epi.) model and the reduced-form (RF) measure in the years (t-1) and (t+1). All regressions control for cohort and state xed e ects. Standard errors are clustered at the state level. ***/**/* indicate statistical "}
