[Tetanus](/conditions/tetanus/) is a serious but rare condition that can be fatal if untreated. The bacteria that can cause tetanus can enter your body through a wound or cut in your skin. They're often found in soil and manure. When to get medical advice See a GP or contact NHS 111 if you're concerned about a wound, particularly if: - the wound is deep - the wound contains dirt or a foreign object - you have not been fully vaccinated against tetanus - you're not sure whether you have been fully vaccinated against tetanus The GP can assess the wound and decide if you need a vaccination or any other treatment. You may need additional treatment for a serious or dirty wound that's considered to be tetanus-prone. Go to [your nearest A&E department](https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/other-services/Accident-and-emergency-services/LocationSearch/428) immediately, or call 999 for an ambulance if you develop severe muscle stiffness or spasms. Tetanus vaccination programme Tetanus vaccination is part of the [NHS vaccination programme](/conditions/vaccinations/childhood-vaccines-timeline/). A full course consists of 5 doses of the tetanus vaccine. This should be enough to give you long-term protection from tetanus. But if you're not sure how many doses you've received, you may need a booster dose after an injury that breaks your skin. If you've definitely received 5 doses of the tetanus vaccine, you're fully vaccinated and do not need a booster dose. Treatment with tetanus immunoglobin If you have a tetanus-prone wound, additional treatment may be given, even if you've been fully vaccinated. Tetanus-prone wounds are described as: - wounds or burns that need surgery, but where surgery cannot be performed within 24 hours - wounds or burns where a significant amount of tissue has been removed, or puncture-type injuries such as animal bites, particularly if they have had contact with soil or manure - wounds containing any substance that should not be there, such as dust or dirt (foreign bodies) - serious fractures where the bone is exposed and prone to infection (compound fractures) - wounds and burns in people who have systemic sepsis, a fall in blood pressure resulting from a serious bacterial infection If you have a tetanus-prone wound and it's considered to be high risk, treatment with tetanus immunoglobulin is recommended. Tetanus immunoglobulin is a medicine containing antibodies that prevent the tetanus toxin working, stopping its effects on the nerves. It provides immediate, but short-term, protection from tetanus. You'll need tetanus immunoglobulin even if you're fully vaccinated against tetanus. Further information Page last reviewed: 12 July 2022 Next "}
