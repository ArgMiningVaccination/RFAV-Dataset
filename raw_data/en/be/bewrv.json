With [relaxing massages](https://www.mandira-ayurveda.at/en/massages-and-spa-treatments/) and [special nutrition](https://www.mandira-ayurveda.at/en/ayurvedic-nutrition/), our detox programmes promote cleansing, inside and out. Let go and recharge There never seems to be enough time to look after ourselves: Our eating habits are unhealthy, we sleep too little and drink too much, and pollutants in our environment add to the harm. As a result, our bodies have to work too hard, eventually losing the ability to eliminate toxins effectively. What we need is a cleansing detox programme to flush out harmful toxins and reset the metabolism. Gentle and holistic: Detoxing the Ayurvedic way In Ayurveda, biochemical toxins are referred to as Ama. An accumulation of Ama adversely affects wellbeing, making us tired and sluggish. Ayurvedic medicine offers many ways to eliminate toxins, and an [Ayurvedic detox programme](https://www.mandira-ayurveda.at/en/panchakarma-treatment-programme/) may include: Cleansing treatments [Gentle massages](https://www.mandira-ayurveda.at/en/massages-and-spa-treatments/) stimulate the lymphatic system and relieve water retention. Oil treatments - such as oil pulling, flowing oil treatments and oil massages - are also an essential component of detoxification, as the fats bind to the toxins and draw them out of the body. Toxins can also be gently eliminated using heat therapy, Ushnodaka therapy (drinking warm water) and nasal rinsing. A light diet A special fasting diet supports internal cleansing by relieving strain on the digestive system and strengthening gut function. We use our knowledge of Indian nutritional science and wisdom to create the optimal diet plan for detoxification. Gentle exercise [Moderate exercise](https://www.mandira-ayurveda.at/en/exercise-and-regeneration/) boosts metabolism and is therefore an integral part of every detox programme. Take a walk in Styria's hilly countryside or swim a couple of lengths in the healing thermal waters. Mind detox with Yoga and meditation Another central aspect of detoxification is letting go of emotional baggage. Daily [Yoga sessions and meditation](https://www.mandira-ayurveda.at/en/ayurveda-yoga-retreat/) facilitate spiritual cleansing and lead to inner balance and harmonious wellbeing.

Take a few deep breaths of the fresh Styrian air and relish the vineyard views. When is a detox programme recommended? Many of today's lifestyle diseases are the result of a frenetic and unhealthy way of life. Stress, poor diet and insufficient sleep all put a strain on body and mind. The resulting stress is signalled in a range of different symptoms: All of these conditions can be significantly improved by detoxing. Although our bodies are equipped with organs - such as the liver, kidneys and skin - that eliminate toxins, these are often unable to deal with the build-up of environmental toxins and negative effects of modern life. A detox programme helps the organs to flush out the toxins, freeing the body of harmful substances and setting its natural healing processes in motion. Detox with home remedies After a detox programme, we recommend that you do not immediately relapse into your old lifestyle. Our Ayurvedic experts are available to help with a diet plan and suggestions for simple ways to support your continued wellbeing at home. With a few simple home remedies, you can also integrate detoxification into your life at home. Why not try: Ayurvedic detox for body and mind [Ayurvedic philosophy](https://www.mandira-ayurveda.at/en/holistic-ayurveda/) addresses all levels of a person's being, including the mental, emotional and spiritual. Therefore, detoxing in Ayurveda means letting go of burdens - whether they be negative thoughts, stress, toxins or extra pounds. Ayurveda helps us become one with ourselves and enter a state of balanced harmony. Vital energy increases, you feel stronger and have more energy. Try it! Life is so much lighter without all that baggage!
