We do this by putting students in direct contact with the distinguished scholars on our faculty, active researchers who routinely teach undergraduate courses. We do this also by empowering our students to conduct their own inquiries, for a liberal arts education is not only about transmitting knowledge but also about teaching our students how to learn for themselves throughout their lives, and how to use that knowledge to have a positive impact on society. NYU's College of Arts and Science has long been at the forefront of promoting undergraduate research. All of our majors, for instance, offer Honors tracks in which original inquiry is central. The College's annual Undergraduate Research Conference was established over 40 years ago and now encompasses projects in all of the humanities, natu- ral sciences, and social sciences, as well as in creative writing. In addition, the Dean's Undergraduate Research Fund, created through the generosity of alumni, parents, and friends, provides students in the College with the material support necessary to carry out their inquiries. (A list of the research scholarships that have been endowed in the Fund appears on page 2 of this journal.) Finally, student funding is also available, particularly in the sciences, from depart- mental resources as well as through external grants that the institution and individual faculty members have received to promote undergraduate research experiences. The annual journal Inquiry showcases abstracts of selected student research. This issue contains abstracts of projects presented at the College's Undergraduate Research Conference held in spring 2023. Research takes many shapes. The students featured in this publication spent time working in a lab with a team of scientists in order to un- derstand brain development; they measured the dimensions of ancient human remains to understand cultural practices surrounding beauty; they picked through boxes in an archive, finding textual evidence to support a literary analysis; or interviewed living eyewitnesses to a major historical event in a foreign country. The majority of these projects were supported by the Dean's Undergraduate Research Fund. But these abstracts represent only a fraction of the research undertaken by CAS students, both as individuals and in groups, under the close mentorship of faculty. Taken all together, the contents of this issue attest to the crucial importance of independent inquiry as a paradigm for a liberal arts education for the twenty-first century. We are very grateful to the students, their faculty mentors, and the generous funders who have made this sort of educational experience, and this journal, possible.

Baer Research Scholar This project seeks to unpack the concept of sov- ereignty within the contextual framework of interwar Egypt, particularly in the years surrounding the promul- gation of the 1922 Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian In- dependence. Egypt existed during this period in a sort of bureaucratic grey zone, suspended somewhere between full national sovereignty and imperial domination. The Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence, issued by the UK government on February 28th, 1922, recog- nized Egypt as an \"independent sovereign state.\" Yet, the very same document carved out five so-called 'reserve powers' for the British. In the decade and a half following the 1922 Declaration, Egypt remained firmly within the British sphere of influence and its relation to its former colonizer continued to dictate its policies and define the state on the international stage. Traditionally, the 1922 Declaration has been cast as the first, if rather inconse- quential, step in Egypt's evolution towards full indepen- dence, as contemporarily defined through the model of the nation-state. However, this project seeks to recast this moment not as a break with imperial tradition, but instead as a perpetuation of the very same ideology and material practices which had underpinned the preceding decades of colonial occupation. The project analyzes the 1922 Declaration against its discursive context, i.e. it exam- ines the declaration in tandem with alternative schemas of geopolitical organization which were pioneered and implemented contemporaneously. Thus illuminating the extent to which these alternative theories of sovereignty or visions of world order, influenced interwar actions and decisions. Effectively, the project argues that the success of the nation-state championed by the emerging liberal internationalist movement, was a contingent rather than assured outcome. Las Meninas and El Museo Nacional Del Prado: Constructing Spanish National Identity from 1900- 1940 Evie Bair, Spanish, Art History Sponsor(s): Professor Jordana Mendelson, Spanish Robert A. Fowkes Research Scholar, Seena and George Silbert Research Scholar Diego Vel\u00e1zquez's Las Meninas has become one of the largest tourist attractions in Madrid, proudly dis- played in the National Prado Museum. It is agreed upon by art history scholars and the general public alike that the 1656 masterpiece is an enigmatic and singular work; and while the mysterious nature of the painting is pal- pable in its composition, interpreting the history of the painting (how it has been perceived and to what purposes it has been used by artists, writers and politicians alike) proves to be highly revelatory in determining its cultural significance. A vast bibliography pertains to the painting and its meaning, but I take interest in where the reception of the work brings art historical interpretation into dia- logue with a consideration of Spanish civil society. This thesis utilizes Las Meninas as a cipher for interpreting the sweeping changes that occurred in Spain from about 1900-1940. In doing so, I argue that Las Meninas, The HUMANITIES16Prado, and the Spanish Artistic Heritage are not simply cultural contributions or tourist attractions, but are crit- ical components in understanding the formulation and manipulation of a Spanish national identity. I trace the critical reception and mobility of the painting (ideolog- ically in some cases, and physically in others), from the onset of the 20th century when the Golden Age artistic tradition became synonymous with Spanish civilization to the Second Spanish Republic and the circulation of copies of Las Meninas in rural Spain as a part of the Pedagogi- cal Missions, through the evacuation of the Prado during the Civil War, and I conclude with the propagandizing of Las Meninas by the r\u00e9gime of General Francisco Franco. Each case study demonstrates how Las Meninas and the Prado was positioned into contested notions of a Spanish national identity. (In)famous Figures: An Analysis of the Ordinary through Ancient Papyrus Zein Blanks, International Relations Sponsor(s): Professor Karen Karbiener, Global Liberal Studies Via the evaluation of the writing and images on an uncatalogued papyrus fragment, its sizing and its aging, the importance of what can be learned from average peo- ple with average lives, what they can tell us about our past to potentially inform our future, became clear. As benefi- cial to society and human development as the great liter - ary and scientific works of our collective past may be, we cannot underestimate the value of the daily accounts we so love to overlook. The uncatalogued papyrus fragment, officially known only as \"Papyrus Fragment: P.NYU found in the Fales Library and Special Collec- tions at New York University (NYU), is a prime example of just that. It houses the partial image on the \"recto\" side of the fragment, very similar, in style and subject, to those on the infamous Fayum Portraits, portraits of the dead placed on their respective mummies during Roman rule in Egypt to honor and identify them (Cartwright, 2020). The woman, though motionless, speaks to her viewers. She tells a story. She seems to tell us of the conditions un- der which people of her social and economic status were subjected to; how they were treated. And thus, the uncata- logued papyrus fragment may be a reinterpretation of the Fayum Portraits for poor or middle-class Greek individ- uals in Egypt between the first and seventh century CE.Divine Mediations: Representations of Religion, Clericalism, and Religious Imagery in Mexican Cinema (1917-2018) Ivan Brea, Politics, Spanish Sponsor(s): Professor Laura Torres-Rodr\u00edguez, Spanish Miller Family Research Scholar What do representations of Catholicism, clerical- ism, and religious imagery in Mexican cinema reveal about Mexican culture? How does the overall context of Mexico being one of the first Latin American countries to secularize yet has always maintained a majority Catholic population reflect itself in Mexican cinema? This thesis analyzes three distinct films, Tepeyac (1917), Mar\u00eda Can- delaria (1943), and ROC\u00cdO (2018), through an angle sel- dom explored in Mexican cultural studies: that of religion. I argue that representations of religion in Mexican cinema work to reconcile and negotiate the position of religion while presenting Catholicism as a distinct mediating and universal force in Mexican society in relation to other postrevolutionary national discourses and projects such as indigenismo and mestizaje. This is primarily achieved through the emphasis on cinema as a mechanism that was used to reeducate the gaze of the religious spectator by fashioning religious imagery to cinematic imagery. In each chapter, I discuss the continual cinematic portrayal of the priest as a mediator, the relationship between reli- gion and technology, and the transformation of the Virgin of Guadalupe into a cinematic image within these three films. Thus, I reveal how religion was an instrumental tool to educate a unique type of gaze of the Mexican citizenry due to the experience of the spectator from the silent film era to the Golden Age of Mexican Cinema. This survey of films illuminates how Mexican films produced diverse messages about the place and role of religion in order to produce a consolidated hemogenic Mexican identity. Local Agency at Crossroads: Yingpan Man as a Unique Case Dustin Chen, Art History, Classics, Philosophy Sponsor(s): Professor Lillian Tseng, East Asian Art and Architecture On the Northeast rim of the Tarim Basin, Ying- pan was one of the historical cities consisting of urban structures, religious architecture, cemeteries, and agricul- tural fields (Xinjiang wenwu kaogu yanjiusuo 2002). In 1999, Xinjiang wenwu kaogu yanjiusuo sur - veyed over 200 tombs in the Yingpan Cemetery and ex- cavated hundreds of cultural objects, mostly dated to the third-fourth centuries (Xinjiang wenwu kaogu yanjiusuo 2002a; Zhao 2017). Among these discoveries, tomb M15 along with the tomb occupant Yingpan Man stood out for its unique burial arrangement and spectacular patterns on well-preserved textiles. Most scholars argued these seemly diverse cultural motifs in the M15 (95BYYM15) 17material assemblage might manifest multiple imperial cultural influences as Yingpan was located on the Silk Road, which connected China in the East with the broader Eurasian region and the Roman Empire in the West. How- ever, my critical literature review reveals how the current scholarship on Yingpan assumed an inevitable imperial cultural influence in the Eurasian area which led to an un- fruitful inquiry into the originality of cultural goods. Con- sequently, I advocate a careful reconsideration of Ying- pan people's local agency in the modification of foreign materials and active selections among various available cultural goods. Close observations on the uniqueness of the Yingpan Man assemblage further bolster a potential theory on local agency. Constructing Categories: Moroccan Jewish Art Caroline Cook, Art History Sponsor(s): Professor Prita Meier, Art History Susan and Robert Grossman Research Scholar With a history nearly as long as Morocco itself, the Jewish communities of Morocco have undergone fasci- nating cultural shifts from the arrival and acculturation of thousands of Sephardic Jews in the late fifteenth-early six- teenth centuries up until the communities' near complete emigration during the 1950s. Much has been written about the history and politics of North African Jewish commu- nities and the ways in which colonialism and modern na- tion-state building has impacted global Jewish identity. Art and culture, however, have not played a significant role in this scholarship. In fact, it was not until recently that the idea of a distinctly Moroccan aesthetic tradition was even considered. This began to change in the early 2000s when The Jewish Museum in New York became one of the first institutions to hold an exhibition entirely devoted to Moroccan Jewish art. Though this exhibition directed the public eye to the importance of Moroccan Jews and their visual culture, its very framework was grounded in anthropological and art historical truisms that produce reductive categories incapable of doing justice to historical complexity and intercultural entanglements. In addition to analyzing the exhibition's far-reaching impact on creating the very category of \"Moroccan Jewish Art,\" this thesis anchors its analysis in the late nineteenth cen- tury to reveal how colonial constructions of memory and modernity made the idea of a Jewish art and its history possible. Finally, this thesis considers the broader concep- tion of Jewish art, and the limits and benefits of categoriz- ing the arts of complex communities.Money and Power: The Interrelation between Finance and Politics through the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's China Loans, 1875-1912 Andy Fan, History, Economics Sponsor(s): Professor Andrew Sartori, History; Professor John Shovlin, History My work examines the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's loans to China from its first loan in 1875 to the end of the Qing dynasty in 1912 to present a careful analysis of the relationship between Britain, China, and the bank itself. The Hongkong Bank existed within a space enabled by imperial actions but didn't act directly as Britain's agent of financial imperialism. My study reviews the Bank's Chinese loan business to ascertain its exact relations with China and Britain, using sources including bank, govern- ment, and Maritimes Customs Office communications as well as contemporary newspapers and journals. I argue that the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank was a business in- stitution that primarily sought to prosper and profit with a stable China in a free-trade environment enabled by the status-quo that Britain helped to bring about; but the weakening and destabilizing of China brought on by for - eign powers at the end of the 19th century led to the bank partnering up with other commercial organizations and re- ceived supported by the British government diplomatical- ly to be able to obtain businesses and deals. The capacity of the Hongkong Bank to finance in China, and the even- tual need for British diplomatic support to obtain loaning opportunities resulted in an informal partnership between the bank and the British government. The implications of my study will better inform how financial firms interact with their home governments. Which further gives insight into the nature and role of politics in finance. Gender for Sale: A Study of Betrothal Gifts and Sex Trafficking in China Stephanie Feng, Economics, Politics Sponsor(s): Professor Julie Mostov, Global Liberal Studies Collegiate Research Scholar This study examines the relationship between the involvement of betrothal gifts and sex trafficking in Xuzhou, a notorious destination of sex trafficking in China, through both qualitative and quantitative meth- ods. The qualitative part analyzed sex trafficking cases in the 1990s in Xuzhou. Dataset for the quantitative part is coded from all publicly available adjudication orders of divorce cases from 2012-2016 of 10 counties in Xu- zhou. There are two major qualitative conclusions. Sex trafficking and receiving betrothal gifts are both lucrative practices, but the former suppresses the voice of females completely. A marriage with betrothal gifts is when social laws, morality of continuing the family, and profit align, while sex trafficking is when only morality and profit 18align, but not modern Chinese laws. In all, betrothal gifts justify sex trafficking. There are three major quantitative conclusions. No involvement of betrothal gifts in mar - riage correlates with high possibility for a female to enter forced marriage, while involvement of betrothal gifts in marriage decreases the possibility greatly for a female to enter forced marriage. However, involvement of betroth- al gifts in marriage does not guarantee a female to avoid entering forced marriage: there is still about 1 in every 5 females who enter forced marriage with betrothal gifts. The seemingly contradictory quantitative and qualitative conclusions reconcile. Although usually no betrothal gifts are involved in recorded sex trafficking cases, for the gray area between sex trafficking and forced marriage, betroth- al gifts become a disguise, conveying an embedded mes- sage: female is the gender for sale. Resonances in Medieval Islamic and Jewish Mystical and Philosophical Texts Produced in Al Andalus Mat\u00edas Gallegos Ruiz, Spanish Sponsor(s): Professor Laura Torres-Rogriguez, Spanish Rose and Barry McMerney Research Scholar As stated by Sara Sviri in \"Jewish-Muslim Mysti- cal Encounters in the Middle Ages With Particular Atten- tion to al-Andalus (Muslim Spain),\" studies in the field have for long split into two sects: that of scholars working primarily with Arabic and Judeo-Arabic texts and those working primarily with Hebrew and Aramaic texts. Both have greatly expanded our understanding of trends and developments in Andalusian mysticism but this separation has also impeded scholars in the field from conducting thorough analysis. Keeping this realization at the fore- front of my research, I plan to expand on what Sviri refers to as the \"Andalusian pre-history\" of latter developments in Jewish mysticism by taking a look at the typological affinities of two Andalusian texts: \"The Epistle on Con- templation\" by the pioneer of mystical philos- ophy Muhammad ibn Masarra produced in tenth-century Al Andalus and \"The Guide to the Duties of the Heart\" by Bahya ibn Paquda produced in the following century. Artists of Conviction: A New Oral History of La Plaza Cultural Luc Giner, History Sponsor(s): Professor Robin Nagle, Global Liberal Studies Nicole and Joseph Meyer Research Scholar In the late 1970s a group of Puerto Rican com- munity organizers in the East Village formed CHARAS (named for the initials of its six founders) to advocate for housing, environmentalism, education, and the arts in the predominantly Latine neighborhood known as Loisaida. CHARAS occupied the vacant city lot on E 9th St & Av- enue C and transformed it into a vibrant community gar -den called La Plaza Cultural. In 1985, La Plaza was filled with murals painted by a group who called themselves the Artmakers. The head muralist, Eva Cockcroft, assembled a diverse, multi-racial coalition of \"artists of conviction\" who donated their time to create political murals in close collaboration with CHARAS. The imagery in the central mural- called \"La Lucha Continua/The Struggle Contin- ues\"- depicted a host of problems faced by the neighbor - hood, including private development, gentrification, and police brutality. Simultaneously, the mural presented an idyllic vision for the future which included sustainable urban agriculture, a flourishing multicultural arts scene, and prominent green space. The mural was designed to visually map and historicize the neighborhood's past, and to establish an aspirational and actionable vision for its future. Although CHARAS was evicted from their orga- nizing space in 2002, La Plaza remains a vibrant presence in Loisaida to this day, conducting a wide range of com- munity events including educational programs, gardening and urban farming opportunities, anarchist book fairs, art builds for protests, cultural celebrations, free concerts fea- turing local artists, and a new solar energy program. My research examines how La Plaza's public programming reflects the garden's roots in radical community organiz- ing, and how garden administrators have continued to foster connections with \"artists of conviction\" since the eviction of CHARAS. German Merchants of the Steelyard and Loss of Hanse Franchises in London: Urban Economies, Foreign Merchant Networks, and Queen Elizabeth's Revocation of Medieval Hansard Trade Privileges 1558-1660 Jeffrey Guan, Mathematics, Economics Sponsor(s): Professor Thomas Truxes, History Collegiate Research Scholar The Anglo-Hanseatic relationship over the course of the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries showcases the de- sire of German merchant enclaves to find safety and se- curity in their own conduct of trade through the use of financial organizations and maritime infrastructures that encourage such commercial linkages to occur. The Hansa were highly efficient merchants, oftentimes doing the job too well and undercutting their English peers in the cloth trade. As the London Steelyard demonstrated, the perma- nence of such a guild hall and other trading houses in a foreign country strengthened the bonds between expatri- ate merchants and their home countries, extending Han- seatic League hegemony and allowing these communities to capitalize upon advantages conferred upon them while serving under the auspices of English law. German mer - chants were among the most favored in England, due to their trade privileges and unique legal standing in society including: the right to roam freely in the conduct of trade, 19and maintaining guild halls, storage, living facilities, and in-house court systems in English territory. Specifically, I want to examine the increasingly hostile stance adopt- ed in London against the Hanseatic merchants during the sixteenth century and the erosion of Hansard medieval privileges under Queen Elizabeth I in the context of an ur - banizing and modernizing London with a global outlook towards mercantile Perrxs Rares Modernes (Modern of Queer Alienism Carlos Hernandez, Photography, Social & Cultural Analysis Sponsor(s): Professor Maria Josefina Salda\u00f1a Portillo, Social & Cultural Analysis; Professor Ann Pellegrini, Social & Cultural Analysis \"Queer Alienism'' is an interdisciplinary critique forging a new framework that better addresses queer mar - ginality within the Dominican context. Through visual ethnography, I examine the prevalent narratives surround- ing and attitudes towards queer in the DR, particularly through Mikhail Bahktin's theory of the carnivalesque, to shed light on the marginal subjectivity of the queer com- munity within the Dominican social imaginary. Through a discussion of the surveillance of the Dominican pop- star Tokischa, I further discuss the intersectional compli- cations of queer Dominicaneity, as issues of race, class, citizenship status, and sexuality work with one another to displace queer Dominicans. Contesting this exclusion through Marx's theories on \"alienation,\" I produce a visu- al response through conceptual photography that provides a new visibility to queerness on the margins, prioritizing pleasure and family. Forging a new narrative for queer people, I focus on the implications of religion, reappropri- ating religious imagery within the series to further contest the religious power within the Dominican government. Alas, through my own artistic practice, I aim to turn to the futurity in Mu\u00f1oz's notion of 'worldmaking' within queer aesthetic practices, expanding the interrogations of my own experiences as well as broader communal ones. By turning to the notion of \"Queer Alienism,\" I adversely depict the modes of community-building that essentially maintain many queer folks alive. Turning to the possibil- ities of queer mythologies and spirituality and provides a site of healing where queer Black and Brown Domini- can experiences may exist within all of its complexities, notwithstanding the contestation of our citizenship and belonging. The Judgment of Fun Zeru Hu, Game Design, Philosophy Sponsor(s): Professor Robert Hopkins, Philosophy; Professor Charles Pratt, Game Design; Professor Paul Boghossian, Philosophy Marion Cohen Griffel Research Scholar In this paper, I explore the nature and justifiabil- ity of the Judgment of Fun: \"This game is fun,\" a claim made by players to evaluate games. To that end, I draw on and apply Kant's theory of the judgment of beauty to the realm of gaming. Kant argues that a judgment of beauty is based on a subjective pleasure, wherein one attaches a feeling of pleasure to a cognitive perception. Similarly, the Judgment of Fun is subjective, as it derives from the pleasure experienced while playing a game. However, un- like judgments of beauty where pleasure is detached from desire-satisfaction, the pleasure in gaming arises from the player's achievements within the game. While subjective, 20the Judgment of Fun claims universal assent, meaning that individuals demand agreement from others regard- ing their evaluation of the game. I propose that this claim to universal assent is a universal imputation of pleasure: under ideal conditions, everyone would share the judge's pleasure in the game judged. These ideal conditions in- volve players pursuing the game's goal for its own sake, which is the only shared objective serving as the com- mon ground for pleasure. Overall, this paper proposes a Kantian analysis of the Judgment of Fun, discovering its subjective universal nature and the grounds on which the universal imputation of pleasure can be made. The find- ings provide insights into the evaluation and aesthetics of games, bridging the Kantian tradition of aesthetics with the contemporary realm of gaming. Diverse Interpretations of and Bias in Dream of the Red Chamber: A Modern Feminist Approach to Classical Chinese Literature Jiayu Huang, East Asian Studies Sponsor(s): Professor Todd Foley, East Asian Studies Hirschfeld Family Research Scholar Born centuries ago, Dream of the Red Chamber remains the most celebrated jewel of Chinese literature. As the title suggests, it is a dreamlike exploration of hu- manity's myriad shades. Authored by the illustrious Cao Xueqin, a nobleman hailing from the Qing Dynasty, a vibrant tapestry of ancient women's lives unfurls capti- vatingly through the eyes of Jia Baoyu, the cherished grandson of the late Duke of Rong. Significantly, this book hatches a new literary field, Redology. Unlike most male-dominated ancient writings in China, Cao is known as the unparalleled female espousal writer, way ahead of his time. To this day, there is almost no comparable work among the countless Chinese masterpieces. Why, how- ever, does his story, which is supposed to be laudatory toward women, elicit such uneasy reverberations among contemporary women? To answer this, I compile theoret- ical research into canonical feminist writings, traditional Redologists' perspectives, online debates, and my own interpretation based on a close reading of the text. My re- search aims to analyze Dream of the Red Chamber with a feminist approach to reveal how it successfully debunks certain gender prejudices by giving readers a complete portrayal of diverse women, why it strikes a chord with modern women, and what kind of malaise it induces in them, as well as how and why a great male writer is in- evitably limited in his vision and given undue privilege. As feminist criticism is still far from the mainstream of Redology, this study intends to fill a gap in this field.Gender and Irish Sign Language: The Development, Difference, and Decline of Female ISL Hope Jackson, History Sponsor(s): Dr. Nicholas Wolf, Glucksman Ireland House Roger and Beth Carlton Research Scholar I am writing an honors history thesis on the topic of Female Irish Sign Language (ISL). I argue that Female ISL has been in decline since its creation in the 1840's due to unconscious social pressures as a result of the gendered social and religious hierarchy in Irish society as well as the desire of Ireland's hearing community for Deaf peo- ple to fit into their societal norms. ISL was created and taught by two Catholic schools that were divided by sex. The two schools were isolated from each other, and many male and female students had never interacted with a deaf individual of the opposite sex by the time they graduated. When they did, they discovered they were using two dif- ferent mutually unintelligible sign languages, Male ISL and Female ISL. Female ISL came under scrutiny and was ridiculed for being childish and overly sexual compared to Male ISL. As a result, Male ISL was used in public while Female ISL was saved for conversations between women, beginning its decline. After the Republic of Ireland gained independence, the Department of Education took over ad- ministration of the schools for the Deaf, requiring them to switch to spoken word education instead of signing. Therefore, Female ISL was not being spoken in public or taught in schools, leading to further decline. Throughout my thesis I discuss the impacts of sexism within the Deaf community and a hearing government had on Female ISL usage and how despite everything Female ISL managed to continue to exist. Oblivio: Reconstructing the Forgotten Memories of Document 0400 Rackeb Kelemu, Comparative Literature, Philosophy, Economics Sponsor(s): Professor Karen Karbiener, Global Liberal Studies Over 5,000 years ago, the world was revolution- ized with the introduction of papyrus sheets, a writing material made from the pith of the papyrus plant that improved the preservation and accessibility of literary documents. \"Oblivio: Reconstructing The Forgotten Memories of Document 0400\" investigates the analysis and reconstruction of one such fragmented papyrus doc- ument, consisting of 8 pieces dating back to 7th Century Ancient Egypt, and retrieved from NYU Fales Library's Collection of Papyri, Ostraka, and Cuneiform (MSS.559). These eight fragments are beautiful and meaningful in- dividually; placed together again, they reveal a dynamic work of art and recover the lost stories and memories of their creators and readers. This presentation will detail the history of this treasure from its origins as a plant, through 21its creation and eventual destruction, ending with a dis- cussion of the significance of these fragments to us today as well as future generations. The research presented is itself noteworthy, as this analysis was accomplished by an NYU freshman without any prior background knowledge of ancient papyri texts, and only with readily available technological equipment. The audience will gain insights into the presenter's research process, demonstrating that it is possible for anyone, including amateur enthusiasts, to uncover forgotten, oblivio, histories and lost narratives that have been hidden in the annals of time. Appreciating the Art of Papyrus: Ancient Forms of Reading and Writing Molly Koch, Art History, Journalism Sponsor(s): Professor Karen Karbiener, Global Liberal Studies The first roll of papyrus, discovered during tomb excavations in Saqqara and dating to around 2900 B.C., was still in use in the eleventh century A.D., even though paper, which was produced in China and became the most common writing medium for the Arab world from around the eighth century A.D. (Szymanski, 2004). This proj- ect has both translation and artistry goals. The transition goals underscore the power of understanding not only the customs of ancient society, but the communication and power of art. Authority and correctness, focus and unity, development and coherence are the aspects of writing that transcended time spans in terms of eternity and transient. Artistically, however, the project raises serious questions about the morality of the written word. Writers of all de- cades desire for their work to outlive themselves even if the physical aspect of it doesn't, which makes it appre- ciably more remarkable to uncover those of the past. To handle both the translation dilemmas and artistry opportu- nities posed by the writing mediums of the ancient world, the role of papyrus has vastly improved the appreciation of the written word, especially of the undocumented. Vikramshila Mahavihara: Before and After Its Destruction (A True Historical Reconstruction of 1300 Years) Anand Kumar, Public Policy Sponsor(s): Professor Karen Karbiener, Global Liberal Studies Collegiate Research Scholar \"The art of a people is a true mirror to their minds.\" This statement of India's first prime minister, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, might help answer the question: why is Bihar, a state holding approximately 1.25% of the world's population, still plagued with poverty and illiteracy? Bi- har's nostalgia for living in the past without valuing its artistic legacies has kept this region as well as the rest of the world, from experiencing several medieval historical sites of significance and beauty. Vikramshila Mahavira (named after yaksha called \"Vikram\"), the place of origin of Lamaism and once home to one of the three epicenters of learning in India, now stands dilapidated. This research project takes viewers on a multimedia tour of this forgot- ten cultural treasure and, in the process, reconstructs the socio-cultural history of the archaeological site, before and after its destruction, across 13 centuries. Research re- sults based on relics of primary archaeological evidence, previously undocumented, partially falsify claims of \"Is- lamic invasion\" of Hindustan and instead documents Hin- duism's role in the decline of other religions originating in the Indian subcontinent. The intent is to draw global attention to a worthy site and also to remind Bihar of the history that could change its future. It is my intention to show Bihar and the world that it is only when a civili- zation looks back, preserves, and learns that it can move forward. El, Elohim, and Elyon: How Divinities Existed in Monotheism Megan Li, Hebrew Bible Sponsor(s): Professor Daniel Fleming, Hebrew and Judaic Studies Psalm 82 is a complex text that challenges tradi- tional assumptions of the Hebrew Bible being a fountain- head for monotheism. Its eight short verses take place in an entirely fantastical setting, with the Israelite God (\"Elohim\") standing in prosecution over other \"gods\" for their apparent misdeeds. These condemned gods are casted down to die as Elohim then judges the earth and assumes rule over all the nations. However, the implica- tion of the presence of these other \"gods\", their title as \"sons of Elyon\", and the scope of the events described have long been points of contention to scholars. I pro- pose a fresh perspective on analyzing Psalm 82 through the lens of exiled victims of imperial invasion responding to their enemies and Elohim, pleading for retribution and hoping to form a nation again. This interpretation situates Psalm 82 with other imperial criticisms such as Isaiah 13- 14 and Nahum 1. It provides precious insight to how Is- raelites viewed older polytheistic traditions in the Middle East, and how they navigated their life in exile so that they could continue to worship their god. China's Reform and Opening Up & the PBOC Diana Liu, History, Economics Sponsor(s): Professor Anne O'Donnell, History Collegiate Research Scholar Tension exists in the different understandings of money and finance in socialism and capitalism. In cap- italism, money and capital naturally flows to the place with the highest rate of monetary return. But in socialism, money and capital should flow to the place where they 22create the most good for society (e.g. heavy industries for national defense). This tension is especially obvious during China's reform and opening up (1978 - 1993). The area in the economy that most significantly manifests such tension and contradiction was the People's Bank of China (PBOC), which was transformed from a clearing house to a central bank in the modern sense during the reform and opening up. The tension between the socialist ideology that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had always up- held, and the realities of market reform persisted through- out China's reform and opening up. By referencing specif- ic ideological leaders from the communist movement and redefining socialist economy, CCP members were able to reshape their ideology within the socialist realm to justify their reforms. The PBOC's transition from a central bank under a fully planned economy to a central bank operating in a semi-open market economy was a slow process that required trial and error and ideological justification. As the CCP adapted its socialist ideology to suit market-ori- ented reform, the institutional evolution of the PBOC was a reflection of the ideological evolution of the CCP throughout the reform and opening up. Papyrus: Analyzing a Time Capsule of an Ancient Language Sydney Nadeau, Mathematics Sponsor(s): Professor Karen Karbiener, Global Liberal Studies How can one connect to a human face drawn thousands of years ago? Who was this person and their significance? Why should we care about this person? Through papyrus, ancient civilizations recorded the or - dinary and extraordinary\u2014unbeknownst to them\u2014to be revisited in a future world intrigued by its fragmented past. Hundreds of thousands of papyrus fragments have been unearthed; some of those were decrypted to be the Iliad, while others were marked as insignificant. A few of those insignificant but yet enchanting fragments from NYU's Special Collections became the subject of my paper. Though these fragments have been frayed and tat- tered by years of erosion, there still remains intact color, writing, and a face, along with a handful of letters to form a single word. Thus begins my investigation into the cre- ator's psyche, where I dissect an ancient face and words to find clues as to who it might have been and their place in history. Hence, my project focuses on eight individu- al pieces from a papyrus fragment and the significance of this ancient message is explored. Characteristics such as size, shape, proportion, color, and quality were each individually examined, and accordingly as a whole, to formulate a backstory of its origins. The focus of the ho- listic examination were the words and drawings embed- ded in these fragments, decoded as part of the research. My findings, developed from an exploration into ancient languages, are presented with two separate hypotheses as to the papyrus' language: Ancient Greek or Late Demotic? Taking Stock: The Singaporean Sustainable Fashion Scene Julia Xin Yu Ng, Metropolitan Studies, Environmental Studies Sponsor(s): Professor Caitlin Zaloom, Social & Cultural Analysis; Professor Andrew Ross, Social & Cultural Analysis Collegiate Research Scholar This project is a holistic analysis of the sustainable fashion sector in Singapore. As a city with a growing rep- utation for wealth and excess, Singapore is a hotbed for overconsumption and its associated environmental issues. At the same time, the topic of fashion in Singapore is one that has been overlooked in academic literature. As such, this study was devised to look at the sustainable fashion movement and all its components through an Urban Stud- ies lens. The research delves into the various business models and offerings from producers in the sector, and goes over consumers' responsiveness to the sustainable fashion movement. Additionally, it looks into the urban institutions that prop up the fashion industry, analyzing how fashion schools, newspapers, and fashion media publications have framed the movement through its 30- year history. Using a combination of interviews, syllabi 23collection, and media analysis techniques, Taking Stock provides insight into a crucial part of the environmental movement and its future potential in the Southeast Asian city. Political Welfarism: A Defense of Well-Being Policy Juan Pava, Economics, Philosophy Sponsor(s): Professor Daniel Viehoff, Philosophy The purpose of this paper is to build on previous work on prudential value and defend the claim that liberal- ism is reconcilable with well-being policy. Hence, I intend to show that it is permissible for legitimate liberal states to establish policies (e.g., sin-taxes, pollution regulation) grounded on considerations about citizens' well-being. This position, which we can call political welfarism, is hardly a radical one and can be seen as defending a form of weak welfarism \u2014in contrast to a strongly welfarist position that claims that the promotion of well-being ought to be the sole purpose of policy. With this objective in mind, this paper is a direct response to Quong's version of Political Liberalism as his position presents the most recent and clear challenge to my view. For, according to Jonathan Quong, legitimate liberal states must not appeal to any considerations of inherent value \u2014 which include well-being\u2014 to justify their policies. Though there is a way in which he is correct, I will show that the value of well-being has as much claim to the public domain as the liberal values of liberty and equality. Scientific Principles of Neurophenomemological Mutual Constraint Gavin S. Perri, Philosophy Sponsor(s): Dr. Luke Roelofs, Philosophy; Dr. Michel Matthias, Philosophy Medical research concerning the therapeutic val- ue of psychedelic-induced 'mystical experience' requires that we enrich neurological data with a rigorous account of lived experience. Neurophenomenology, a research program proposed to solve the Hard Problem of con- sciousness, provides an account of how phenomenology and naturalism can 'mutually constrain' and augment each other. the ontological and methodological prin- ciples by which neurophenomenologists reconcile with phenomenology have not been elucidated. 'Mutual constraint' demands that in the event of conflict between a phenomenological and a natural scientific ap- proach, we revise the method of either or both research approaches such that they cohere. But how? This project will argue for principles by which phenomenology and natural science are conceived of as equally meritorious research approaches which study separate yet interrelated subject matters.Moral Motivation in Spinoza and Kant: Reason, Freedom, and Causality Michael Poling, Philosophy Sponsor(s): Dr. Don Garrett, Philosophy Count Lorenzo Attolico di Adelfia Research Scholar The problem of moral motivation is a fundamen- tal problem for moral philosophy. This paper attempts to theorize an analogy between the answers to this issue giv- en by two Early Modern European philosophers: Baruch Spinoza and Immanuel Kant. The first section establishes similar features in their accounts by arguing for an inter - nalist interpretation of the moral motivation in Spinoza and Kant. The second section seeks an explanation for the similar features in the broader moral theories, and aims to argue that for both an internalist theory of moral moti- vation is a means for maintaining a relationship between moral action, freedom, and rationality. The final section seeks to explain how internalism can accomplish this by analyzing the theories of causality given by Spinoza and Kant, with a particular emphasis on how human freedom functions as a kind of causality. Ultimately, the aim of this paper is to argue that certain similarities in the accounts of moral motivation offered by Spinoza and Kant can be explained by other similarities in their broader moral and metaphysical theories, thus motivating a new apprecia- tion of the continuity between moral motivation and other fields of philosophy and between Spinoza and Kant in the history of philosophy. Reframing Art as Labor: The Aesthetic, Political, and Economic Ideology of the Art Front Aradhana Sai Prabhala, History, Politics Sponsor(s): Professor Kimberly Phillips-Fein, History The Art Front was a short-lived magazine from November 1934 to December 1937, formed after Nelson Rockefeller destroyed Diego Riviera's mural \"Man at the Crossroads.\" The Art Front's primary economic goal was to replace private patronage systems with government support. The Art Front believed it fought for artists and their economic independence, and acted as an administra- tive hub for the Arts Unions. The Art Front was critical in publicizing, framing, and advocating for issues. The Art Front was an interesting experiment for studying activ- ism through art. The Art Front provided innovative ideas to support artists and improve their material conditions through a combination of government support and union advocacy. What also distinguished the Art Front from other magazines was its ability to analyze art on its own terms. Combined with innovative ideas to improve the material conditions of artists, the Art Front treated art as a stand-alone discipline and contextualized its economic goals through defining what it meant to create revolution- ary art. How the Art Front approached the aesthetics of politics, functioned as a political organization tool, and 24fiercely advocated for artists make it a viable means to understand how to reinterpret labor as work and how to organize cultural workers today. The Living Legacy of an Eternal Art Piece: Euripides' Trojan Women through Three Modern Lenses Weiqi Qiu, Philosophy, Mathematics Sponsor(s): Professor Karen Karbiener, Global Liberal Studies; Dr. Elizabeth Lee, Global Liberal Studies Collegiate Research Scholar \"Art is essentially the affirmation, the blessing, and the deification of existence\" (Nietzsche, 1968). True! An art piece lives on because of its endless potential for inter - pretation and capability to present its essence, namely, the existence of humanity, via diverse mediums. That's the case for Athens' well-known playwright Euripides' Tro - jan Women, an ancient Greek Tragedy that embodies the desperation of Trojan females and children after the fall of the majestic city of Ilion, in which poor Trojans lose all their possessions to Greeks. This project attempts to appreciate Euripides' classic through three modern lenses: a latter-day translation of Euripides' original play script, a thought-provoking graphic novel, and a live pansori per - formance (Shapiro, 2009; Bruno and Carson, 2021; Na- tional Theatre of Korea, 2022). Apart from the common ground, artistically and philosophically, this project also analyzes some critical divergences in the representation of manifold art mediums of the play's prologue, thus raising some crucial questions. Who shall introduce the prologue, humans or divinities? What's the philosophical implica- tion behind that distinction of introducers? How do vari- ous art mediums display the tragic and chaotic scene dif- ferently? What are their effects? In turn, the project digs into several vital topics about human existence, includ- ing destiny and free will, hope and despair, and war and peace. By comparing how each medium uniquely portrays the prologue of Trojan Women, this project reveals the contemporary sensibility, relevance, and significance of this eternal classic, whose reflection upon the tragic ker - nel of human existence shines throughout the history of humanity. Building Better: The Ethics of Gentrification in New York City Harlan Reiss, Urban Design & Architecture Studies, Philosophy Sponsor(s): Professor Jon Ritter, Urban Design & Architecture Studies Kringstein Family Research Scholar Discussions of gentrification, dating back to the mid-20th century, reflect the myriad interconnected expe- riences of city residents in the face of rapid neighborhood evolution. Though the term gentrification is a mainstay within the vernacular of urban dwellers, its exact deno-tation (and connotation) are not clearly understood. This paper gives an account for what gentrification entails, set- tling on an understanding of gentrification that focuses on renter displacement caused by increased rent prices after an influx of relatively affluent people into a neighbor - hood. Through careful examination of gentrifying neigh- borhoods in Brooklyn, this paper explores the ethical implication of gentrification, outlining the three classes of morally agents responsible for the adverse effects of gentrification: (1) private citizens, (2) real estate and relat- ed professionals, and (3) members of the government and policy makers. Ultimately, this paper argues that mem- bers of government are most responsible for mitigating against the damages caused by gentrification and protect- ing neighborhood residents. Then, drawing on global case studies in successful housing policy, this paper will offer policy solutions that should be implemented in New York City in response to the renter displacement. Shifting Attitudes and Censorship: The Evolution of Mother-and-Child Prints in Edo-Period Japan Emily Ren, Art History Sponsor(s): Professor Thomas Looser, East Asian Studies Susumu Okamura Research Scholar During Japan's Edo period (1603-1868), women's social identities were constrained to two models: domes- tic wives and mothers, who were confined to the private sphere and prohibited from exhibiting their sexuality pub- licly, and prostitutes, who were associated with the sex trade and frequently depicted in widely circulated prints. To reconcile the restrictive confines imposed upon moth- ers, Japanese woodblock artists adopted the idealized feminine model commonly used to depict high-ranking prostitutes to portray mothers in mother-and-child prints. This paper explores the significance of these prints, ex- amining their intended audience and how their depiction of the mother as the young feminine ideal reinforced mi- sogyny and contributed to the construction of femininity in the patriarchal society. From the early eighteenth to the mid-nineteenth century, a series of government reforms aimed to restore social order and morality through strict censorship of the printing industry, which led to changes in the representation of mother-and-child images. Artists such as Kitagawa Utamaro (?-1806) responded to the strict censorship on sex-related and sumptuous prints by re-interpreting the mother-and-child relationships in the prints. Utamaro's works sexualized mother figures and in- corporated seductive elements into their depiction, there- by violating the expectations associated with desexual- ized and private gender roles of mothers. Yet, these works gained commercial success, revealing shifting attitudes towards representations of motherhood in early-modern Japan. This paper aims to examine the motivations and methods behind these controversial alterations and how 25they contributed to the fluidity of social boundaries and the erosion of morality in the period. \"James Joyce or Socialist Realism?\" Marxist Aesthetics, Interpretive Praxis, and Ulysses' Dialectical Theory of History Natasha Roy, English and American Literature, Politics Sponsor(s): Professor John Waters, English and American Literature William J. McKeon Research Scholar Ireland's powerful democratic socialist party Sinn F\u00e9in is today a reliable source of hope for beleaguered Marxists in a unipolar capitalist landscape. Sinn F\u00e9in's ascendency to power\u2014beginning when Arthur Griffith founded the party in 1905\u2014is thus critically important to contemporary Marxist theory. Yet a thorough study of Fe- nian history will begin not with Griffith in 1905 but with Leopold Bloom in 1904. Or so James Joyce suggests in his 1922 novel Ulysses. Joyce playfully writes that his pro- tagonist, Bloom\u2014who has been \"going about with some of them Sinner F\u00e9in lately\"\u2014was the one who \"gave the ideas for Sinn F\u00e9in to Griffith\" in 1904. So Bloom, not Griffith, becomes the father of a still monumental Sinn F\u00e9in. In its careful treatment of Sinn F\u00e9in's origins, one could imagine Ulysses to be a darling of Marxist aesthet- ics. So why did Joyce's vision of Irish Marxism fail in the eyes of orthodox Marxist critics? From the moment of its publication, Marxist critics have widely and virulent- ly lambasted Ulysses. The 1934 Soviet Writers Congress, which first programmatized Socialist Realism, converged around the speech: \"James Joyce or Socialist Realism?\" Ulysses thus became the paradigmatic hyper-capital- ist text. This thesis argues that early Marxist criticisms of Ulysses misread Joyce's diachronic representation of Sinn F\u00e9in as a restrictively synchronic one. These Marx- ist objections to Ulysses grew from ideological criticisms of a 1920s and 1930s Sinn F\u00e9in, which occluded Joyce's version of the 1904 Dubliner with Hungarian-Jewish dialectical to Sinn F\u00e9in antisemitism. I thus argue that Ulysses proposes a deeply diachronic, deeply Marxist theory of history. I also consider the broader implications of such misread- ing for Marxist aesthetics today, arguing for the dialecti- cal interpretive praxis that is forcefully proposed within Ulysses. Redefining Indigenous Feminist Art: Matriarchal Indigenous Artist Jaiden S\u00e1nchez, Art History Sponsor(s): Professor Carol Krinsky, Art History Collegiate Research Scholar Most Indigenous artists are designated to the genre of Indigenous Feminists, especially those who convey themes of gender & politics, land, and environ- ments. While the inclusion into the mainstream Feminist movement aided Indigenous peoples' cause, often this identification is cause for discourse amongst Indigenous 26women, elders, and communities, sharing statements such as \"feminism is against our culture\". This shared belief lies within the stages that the term sets up for Indigenous women, placing them side-by-side with often privileged upper-class white women. The reality is that Indigenous women and Non-native white women have not stood equally within the fight for equality, safety, and nation- al sovereignty. Indigenous women artists are subject to much more scrutiny and stigmatization and often left out of conversations of Feminist Art, thus there is a need for a new definition and self-identification for Native and Indigenous women artists. Through a careful analysis of artists Jaune Quick-to-See (Smith) and Andrea Carlson on their thematic elements, use of color and symbolism, this essay will delve into the depths of their work in order to better understand the artists' intention and message in comparison to one another and redefining what it would mean to be a Matriarchal Indigenous artist. Even a Blank Piece of Papyrus has a Story to Tell Aria Tameze, Economics, Anthropology Sponsor(s): Professor Karen Karbiener, Global Liberal Studies Papyrus begins its story in its antiquity, about \"two thousand years ago, [when] papyrus was the most popu- lar writing material in the world\" (Papyrus Making 101). When looking at a sheet of papyrus, one must consider the various features it has to understand the story it tells of its past. As such, features like the color and shape of the papyrus, the style and type of handwriting used, the type of writing tool used to create such handwriting, and the pattern of the ink used are all imperative to accomplish the task of deciphering an undeciphered piece of papyrus. These features were all taken into account in my project wherein I faced the task of deciphering an undeciphered piece of papyrus, \"Document 0029,\" found in NYU's Special Collections. But what happens when the piece of papyrus that needs decoding is, for all intents and purpos- es, blank? How does one approach the story then? This is the task that I faced, and my findings are presented in this project. Homelands across the Wall: Comparative Study of Warring-States-to-Han and Ming Great Walls in Eastern China Ruolin Wang, East Asian Studies Sponsor(s): Professor Ethan Harkness, East Asian Studies Washington Square College Class of '42 Research Scholar in Humanities This honors thesis considers the difference between the Great Walls of China constructed in different periods and seeks to determine the reasons behind such differ - ence. When viewing the Great Wall resources of China on map, one may notice that the eastern half of the Walls constructed during the Warring-State-to-Han periods (403 BCE-220 CE) are situated further to the north from their counterpart built during the Ming Dynasty (1368 CE- 1644 CE). Wang Shaodong has provided a novel idea in his recent publication that could possibly explain such dif- ference, that is the purpose of constructing the early Walls by the Warring States and subsequent dynasties was not to defend but to expand the northern territories. This caused the early Walls to be situated further north and beyond the natural barriers of the Yan and Taihang Mountains. After examining the archaeological reports and online databas- es of the Great Wall resources alongside historical records quoted by Wang Shaodong, this honors thesis concludes that the existing evidence supports this novel argument. This thesis also includes case analysis of the Ming Great Wall and concludes that it was the defensive strategy of the Ming court that led the eastern part of the Wall to be constructed along the Yan and Taihang Mountains in or - der to maximize the effectiveness of defense. Therefore, it was the difference in the purposes of wall construction that caused the Warring-States-to-Han and Ming Great Walls to be situated at different locations. Contestations of Authority in the Investiture Controversy (1076-1122) Elliott Wenzel, History Sponsor(s): Professor Karl Appuhn, History Holten Family Research Scholar The Investiture Controversy was a conflict be- tween 1076 and 1122 between the Papacy of Rome and the kings of Germany. The primary issue was the matter of investiture, or the investment of bishops. It had been tradition for kings to appoint their own candidates, often unqualified or corrupt ones, and Pope Gregory VII disput- ed that authority. Over the course of the conflict, the pope set forth an expansive view of Papal authority, not only about the investment of bishops but also about the role of the Church and the Papacy in medieval European life, including the ability to judge and depose kings. The pa- per presented examines the gap between Gregory's claims and the reality of the socio-political situation. While mak- ing grand claims to both spiritual and temporal authori- ty, Gregory could not back up these ideas with power to enforce them and as a result the crisis lasted for decades after his pontificate.2728 29Primary Caregivers' Barriers to Participating in Research Srinidhi Lisa Abe, Neural Science Sponsor(s): Professor Natalie Brito, Applied Psychology In developmental and neuroscience research, many studies are designed to understand disparities of, and dif- ferences in, child outcomes among children across dif- ferent socioeconomic classes. To carry out these studies, researchers must successfully recruit subjects from vary- ing backgrounds. However, a common challenge faced by researchers is recruiting and retaining participants from lower resourced and minority populations. This results in developmental and neuroscience research to be heavily dominated by white, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic populations. There are several barriers that prevent people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds from participating in research studies that have not been adequately addressed. Examples of these barriers include lack of financial support, child care, transportation, and knowledge regarding the study, and therefore, a hesi- tance to partake in it. Additionally, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected lower resourced minorities, presenting new barriers to participating in remote research studies which have not been studied over the past year. Thus, our research ques- tion asks what the most prevalent barriers, exacerbated by COVID-19, that primary caregivers' face when participat- ing in research studies. Due to the many limitations that are not addressed by studies, this project is designed to understand the multitude of barriers that primary caregiv- ers of infants or young children encounter when engag- ing in research studies. We anticipate that generating data regarding the most prevalent barriers caregivers encoun-ter will help us design a future study to uncover efficient solutions that mitigate these barriers, and promote inclu- sivity and accessibility among New York City residents. Who We Feed: An Analysis of Food Security Organizations in Fairfax County, Virginia Brandon Barnes, Psychology Sponsor(s): Professor Amy Best, George Mason University, Center for Social Science Research Fairfax County, with the 5th highest median in- come of any U.S. county according to the 2020 Census, is perceived to be an affluent suburban community with little need for resources to combat food insecurity. Ac- cording to the USDA, a household can be labeled as food insecure if they are \"uncertain of having or unable to ac- quire enough food to meet the needs\" of their household's members, a label that can be applied to approximately 6% of Fairfax County households according to various stud- ies. The purpose of this project was to collect data on ex- isting food access organizations in Fairfax County to pro- vide a framework to the Fairfax County government as to what the current capability of combating food insecurity is and where more infrastructure is needed. Over 50 or - ganizations were identified using internet searches, social media, and preexisting capacity maps. Mapping was done with ArcGIS software to show the geographic location of each organization in relation to areas of highest vulnera- bility within Fairfax County. Data was also collected in regards to the barriers present at each organization, look- ing at documents and referrals required for food access as well as availability of food pickup to determine the ca- pacity of each organization to meet the needs present in their area. Understanding the organizational capacity of SOCIAL SCIENCES30food access organizations within a perceived affluent area creates a picture of what health risks are created when we presume the need of resources within an area but also how our understanding of suburban communities impacts the ability of said communities to receive the resources they require. The Effects of Economic Recession on Deportation Rates of Latinx Immigrants Freddy Barrera, Politics Sponsor(s): Professor Christopher Dawes, Politics Shirley Schmones Wallach Research Scholar Deportations have long-lasting serious conse- quences on individuals, their families, and communities as a whole. Therefore, this thesis paper attempts to explore conditions that make Latinx immigrants residing in the United States more susceptible to being deported. Specif- ically, this paper analyzes the relationship between rises in unemployment rates and rates of Latinx deportations. This paper finds that there is indeed a positive relation- ship between unemployment rates and deportations rates, therefore supporting evidence that Latinx immigrants are more vulnerable to deportations during times of economic hardship. Examining Gendered Expectations of Gay and Lesbian Individuals Arushee Bhoja, Psychology Sponsor(s): Professor Madeline Heilman, Psychology Collegiate Research Scholar Though there is much research investigating pre- scriptive stereotypes for men and women, generally, there is limited research that examines how prescriptive gender stereotypes may be altered for gay and lesbian individu- als, who are already perceived to violate traditional gen- der roles (Mize & Manago, 2018). The purpose of this study is to investigate whether people apply the same ex- pectations to gay and lesbian people occupying gendered social roles as they do to their straight counterparts. In a between-subjects randomized experiment, participants evaluated a target that differed in gender (male or female), sexual orientation (gay or straight), and gender role (ei- ther feminine caregiver or masculine provider) in terms of overall perception, likeability, and competence. Mean contrasts showed that both gay and straight men received significantly higher overall perception ratings in mascu- line over feminine roles, and simple slope comparisons showed that this difference was significantly greater for straight men than gay men. Gay and straight women re- ceived similar overall ratings and likeability ratings in both roles. All targets were rated as more competent in the masculine role than the feminine role, indicating that for both men and women, perceived competence is more closely associated with the stereotypically masculine pro-vider role than the stereotypically feminine caregiver role. These findings suggest that the masculine provider role is prescriptive for men, regardless of sexuality, though to a greater degree for straight than gay men. Neither feminine caregiver nor masculine provider roles are particularly socially prescriptive for women, regardless of sexuality. Predictive Causational Determinant Analysis on Real Estate Market Bubble across US & China Becky Bian, Economics and Mathematics; Annie Kong, Computer Science/Math; Tianyun Fang, Economics and Mathematics; Yuxin Meng, Economics and Mathematics Sponsor(s): Professor Anasse Bari, Computer Science Collegiate Research Scholar Artificial Intelligence (AI) consists of mature ma- chine learning capabilities that have been helping in the existing efforts to solve some of the world's most com- plex problems in the developing world. In this study, we survey AI tools that have been successfully deployed to help solve problems in education, environment, health- care among 7 application fields in total. According to our study, Machine/Deep Learning and Natural Lan- guage Processing are two most vital AI capabilities that are mostly used in helping the developing world across different sectors, with an overall usage frequency of 57 times and 28 times respectively among the 76 applications evaluated in this essay. In terms of each specific sector, 100% of applications in education evaluated here employ Machine/Deep Learning, Image and Video Classifica- tion, Language Understanding and Translation, as well as Sound Detection and Recognition. On the other hand, almost 94.4% of environment applications among 18 use cases studied depend on Machine/Deep Learning while other techniques were seldom used. In healthcare, 100% of use cases studied apply Machine/Deep Learning tech- niques while that proportion in finance is 100% as well with Natural Language Processing being used 70% of the time. The uneven AI capability development and usage frequency preferring Machine/Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing is a common phenomenon across all other sectors in developing countries, indicating the im- portance of investment priority for developing countries on both techniques in the future development to maximize their payoffs across sectors. Dissecting Underrepresentation: A Study on Black and Latinx Premedical Student Support Networks Jeremiah Isaak Bonnet, Sociology Sponsor(s): Professor Alex Barnard, Sociology; Professor Ruth Horowitz, Sociology Collegiate Research Scholar According to application and enrollment data of- fered by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), Black and Latinx students apply to and enroll 31in U.S. MD-granting medical schools at similar rates. Of- ten, scholarship addressing underrepresentation in med- icine compares underrepresented\u2014Black, Latinx, and Indigenous\u2014students and physicians to white and Asian students and physicians. This thesis examines the under - represented population more closely by comparing two demographics: Black and Latinx pre-medical students. By investigating the unique experiences of different un- derrepresented groups, we can begin to develop more targeted interventions to help support these students in their academic and professional pursuits. I conducted 22 interviews to explore students' understanding and use of familial, financial, social, and academic support. This study argues three points: First, the Latinx identity, in an educational context, is a more effective means of catego- rization from outside the Latinx community than it is of inward affinity from within; second, compared to Black students, non-Black Latinx students view their ethnicity as more salient than race to their academic and profes- sional experiences. Thus, their Latinx identity is more of an ethnic identity than a racial one; and third, institutional diversity-based initiatives catered to all underrepresent- ed pre-medical students will successfully attract students whose identities are reflected in its leadership. From these arguments, I propose future directions for inquiry, high- lighting the need for further exploration of ethnicity-fo- cused programs within the Latinx community, careful evaluation of the efficacy of all-encompassing institution- al diversity initiatives, and a deeper investigation of Black solidarity and its ability to transcend ethnic differences. Children's Understanding of the Role of Economic Disadvantage in Academic and Professional Success Violet Brede, Psychology Sponsor(s): Dr. Melis Muradoglu, Psychology; Professor Andrei Cimpian, Psychology John G. Fleming Research Scholar One's economic standing has profound conse- quences for experiences in school and work. However, children's conceptualization of patterns of social class in education and work is poorly understood. In this study, we examine children's understanding of how economic status contributes to academic and professional outcomes, and whether children's ideological beliefs (i.e., meritoc- racy endorsement) are associated with this understand- ing. In a main task, 7- to 12-year-old children (N = 95, Mage = 9.56) viewed 12 vignettes, each concerning one advantaged character and one disadvantaged character. Children selected the character more likely to be associ- ated with present outcomes (e.g., \"gets really good grades on tests\") and future outcomes (e.g., \"will not graduate high school\"). Half the outcomes were positive and the other half were negative. Then, children completed a mer - itocracy endorsement questionnaire (e.g., \"Everyone has the same chances to succeed at school\"). Results show that, for items concerning present outcomes, children's responses were at chance-they selected the advantaged character about half the time for both positive and neg- ative outcomes. For items concerning future outcomes, however, children were more likely to associate advan- taged characters with positive outcomes and disadvan- taged characters with negative outcomes, reflecting some understanding of how economic disadvantage affects life outcomes. This understanding of patterns of social class in school and work was not related to children's beliefs about how society rewards individuals. Future work should examine when children begin to understand the role of economic standing in more immediate school con- texts, and other sources (e.g., socioeconomic status) of this understanding. Mapping Lithics in Mongolia's Taiga Andrew Califf, Anthropology, Journalism Sponsor(s): Professor Pam Crabtree, Anthropology Collegiate Research Scholar The Darkhad Depression is an ethnocultural boundary in northern Mongolia between the reindeer herders of the taiga who still hunt and gather despite na- tional park regulations, and the Mongolian pastoralists herding grazing animals in the lower steppes of the valley. This research has put together maps of stone tool lithic scatters surveyed in the taiga during 2022's field season and a few past isolated sites to predict where other sites may be found by future expeditions. Surveying in this area presented the opportunity to observe the relationships between early peoples and their environment through modern technologies, while also detecting different strat- egies people used to survive and how they interacted with other groups. Materials and Methods: The archaeological sites were surveyed by horseback and pedestrian survey, and the material, type and size of the stone tools found were recorded and their locations marked with a hand- held Garmin InReach GPS. Topographical analysis shed light on how the owners of these tools used this unique region and how different strategies were adapted to such a dynamic liminal space of transition. Key Findings: The hunter-gatherers associated with these lithic scatters pri- marily used black chert to make refined microblades, and by all indicators, were forced to move through the mountains in the taiga in response to the glacial meltwa- ter draining from Darkhad Depression. They in turn were organized in small camps along routes of travel, prefer - ring gradually sloping areas alongside modern bogs near the edge of saddle passes in between the taiga's higher peaks. Conclusion: These different map interfaces and terrain maps identified how these ancient taiga inhabitants deviated from valley populations. Paired with climato- logical research of the region, mapping the lithic scatters 32illustrated how people responded to the changing glacial conditions. Black Maternal Health: Beyond the Scope of Interpersonal Racism Lolayemi Charles, Global Public Health/Sociology Sponsor(s): Dr. Karyn Faber, College of Global Public Health, Experiential Learning Joan Kupersmith Larkin Research Scholar In New York City, black women are eight times more likely to die from pregnancy-related outcomes than white women and 2.6 times more likely to experience serious complications during labor. Existing research ex- amines medical racism, but lacks an exploration of how social systems external to the medical environment con- tribute to poor maternal health outcomes. This research employs the social determinants of health as a framework to qualitatively assess concerns of health, safety, and risk amongst women in the prenatal and postpartum reproduc- tive period. Methods: This study conducted 20 60-minute semi-structured interviews with black-identifying (His- panic and non-Hispanic) women in the prenatal and post- partum stages in New York City. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded in Atlas.ti to identify key themes. Findings were compared across parity, reproduc- tive period, and borough of residence. Results: The areas of concern most commonly identified during the prena- tal and postpartum stages were housing, financial secu- rity, and familial support. Only two participants reported concerns or experiences with interpersonal racism in the medical environment. All women reported experiencing elevated stress levels due to non-healthcare-related issues prior to giving birth. Conclusion: This study highlights missed opportunities for interventions that address the myriad of stressors that impact maternal health outcomes before the point of delivery. While bias and interpersonal racism are aspects of poor clinical care, the results of this study indicate that inequalities in social systems external to the medical environment shape the medical experience of Black and Afro-Latina women throughout the repro- ductive time period. Reactions to AI-Generated vs. Human-Generated Stimuli Lisa Chen, Psychology Sponsor(s): Professor David Bosch, Psychology Recent developments in, and the increased use of, AI products like ChatGPT have raised questions and con- cerns about the creative abilities of the software. Through this research, we investigated whether humans could distinguish between Human-generated and AI-generated content. We predict that participants cannot reliably iden- tify the content source and, importantly, that preference for either type of content is based on beliefs about who or what created it. Further, these beliefs will be motivated by algorithm aversion, a phenomenon that people avoid AI-generated advice when they know it is from an AI source (Dietvorst 2015), and surveys on the general pop- ulation's opinion toward AI-generated content (Longoni, Bonezzi 2019). To test these predictions, we designed a two-part experiment to investigate perceptions and atti- tudes toward human-generated versus AI-generated con- tent. Study one tests whether participants can distinguish between human-created and AI-generated images without labeling and asks them to rate the aesthetic quality of the content. In study two, we label some AI content as human content, and vice versa, and then measure people's atti- tudes towards the content. We predict that participants will respond favorably to human-generated content regardless of the true source. Our expected results could inform con- sumers and corporations on how to approach AI use in the workplace and the marketplace. As policymakers attempt to address AI software, understanding how people interact with the software is crucial in creating effective legisla- tion, and our results could inform policy. Flexible Citizenship: Opportunities and Tensions among Chinese International Students at NYU Franklin Cheng, Anthropology Sponsor(s): Professor Amy Zhang, Anthropology Howard Levene (WSC '41) Research Scholar Situated in the heart of New York City, New York University hosts a huge Chinese international student population. Based on interviews and participant observa- tion with thirty undergraduate Chinese international stu- dents at NYU since 2022, this project aims to continue the discussion on citizenship. The definition of citizenship has evolved constantly, from fixed geographical borders to individual transnational relocation and further to the analysis of legal, social, and cultural subcategories. The previous discussion of citizenship can no longer encapsu- late the identity of current international students at NYU. Hence, this project ultimately argues that current NYU Chinese international students are demonstrating a new definition of citizenship: ultra-flexible citizenship. Unlike previous research that targets the transnational nature of relocation, this ethnographic research focuses on the lo- calness of Chinese international students and the agency of individuals in relation to the state regime. For a recent generation of Chinese students, their proficiency in En- glish, economic affluence, and ability to adapt to local culture diminish their \"foreignness.\" On the one hand, the ultra-flexible notion of citizenship and savviness that Chi- nese students are presenting provide them with unprece- dented opportunities to achieve a new degree of upward mobility than their historical predecessors. On the other, ultra-flexible citizenship is a deliberate mode of living by the individual to maximize economic, social, and cultural 33capital under the inherent political and legal constraints. By defamiliarizing the established definition of citizen- ship, this research seeks to offer a fresh lens to examine transnational citizenship in an age of rapid transnational movement. \"A Slippery Slope of No Return\": Singapore's LGBTQ+ Community in the Aftermath of Section 377A Anyu Ching, Journalism, Public Policy Sponsor(s): Professor Robert Boynton, Journalism; Professor Ted Conover, Journalism Collegiate Research Scholar Following the December 2022 repeal of Section 377A, a colonial-era law criminalizing sex between men, two questions arose within Singapore's LGBTQ+ community: 1) What's next? and 2) Is this it? Some ac- tivists championed the repeal, viewing it as a symbol of the country's growing tolerance towards matters regard- ing the queer community. Others noted that in the same speech where Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced Section 377A's impending repeal, he made a point to re- assure the country's strong conservative population that marriage will continue to be a sacred vow made between two people of opposing genders. This balancing act on the part of the Singapore government to try to appease every spectrum of society is a major point of contention among members of the LGBTQ+ community in the country. This thesis explores the aftermath of the repeal of Section 377A through the lens of current LGBTQ+ rights activists in the country as well as members of the queer community at large. In addition, this thesis explores the discrepancies between the rights members of the LGBTQ+ community were promised and the rights they received, along with the shifts in attitudes and expectations between older and younger LGBTQ+ rights activists\u2014from the lead- er of Singapore's first pride parade in 2008 to the latest LGBTQ+ rights group formed in 2022. The Complex Experience of the Gay American Conservative in the Reagan Era Long Ching Chung, Politics Sponsor(s): Professor Timothy Naftali, History Collegiate Research Scholar American Conservatives today often promote het- eronormative family values, and yet the existence and influence of gay conservatives, such as Terry Dolan and Marvin Liebman, in the 1980s cannot be overlooked. Conservatives' opinion on their gay political allies has never been uniform, but it can be observed that most nationally prominent conservatives such as William F. Buckley, Jr. and Ronald Reagan are often critical and in- sensitive when publicly commenting on LGBT issues de- spite remaining socially close to some gay conservatives. On the other hand, as social conservatism's prominence grows subsequent to the end of the cold war, the internal divide on this issue within the conservative movement has broadened. My research project's primary object is to ex- amine how American conservatives' views on conserva- tive members of the LGBT community have evolved over 34the years since the beginning of the Cold War. Through consulting published articles and private correspondence of conservative opinion leaders and hence examining prominent conservatives' public and private opinion on gay conservatives, I conclude that American conserva- tives have, counterintuitively, become less accepting of LGBT conservatives since the conclusion of the cold war. I also hypothesize that such a shift was due to social con- servatism overtaking ideological anti-communist rhetoric as American conservatism's core values. The Role of Parent Science Beliefs and Parent Science Language in Shaping Children's Science Outcomes Sophia Cordeiro, Psychology Sponsor(s): Professor Marjorie Rhodes, Psychology; Michelle Wang, Psychology Shirley Schmones Wallach Research Scholar The use of identity-focused language when com- municating with children about science (e.g., \"Let's be scientists! Scientists discover new things\") has negative impacts on children's - especially girls' - science out- comes. Parents are a large source of the language chil- dren hear from an early age and parents' beliefs shape children's outcomes in various domains. However, it re- mains unclear in what ways parents' beliefs and language relate to each other and whether they impact children's outcomes together. The present longitudinal study exam- ines the role of parents' beliefs about science and parent language when communicating with their children about science in shaping children's science outcomes, as well as whether parent language is a mechanism through which parents communicate their science beliefs to their chil- dren. We found that (a) parents' exclusive and stereotypi- cal science beliefs shaped both girls' and boys' long-term science outcomes negatively, while the effects of parent identity-focused science language were more variable and only detrimental to girls and (b) parents' beliefs and lan- guage independently rather than jointly shape children's science outcomes. Together, these findings suggest that language may be a driving factor in explaining observed gender disparities in STEM, but because parents' identi- ty-focused science language doesn't appear to be tied to their deeper-held science beliefs, this language can poten- tially be easily modified through strategic interventions aimed at replacing parent science language to be more inclusive. The Effect of Silica Concentration on Stone Tool Polish Formation AJ Crawford, Anthropology Sponsor(s): Professor Radu Iovita, Anthropology Dr. Charles Barbiere Research Scholar The analysis of archaeological stone tools is a very important way of learning about the true function of the tool itself. A very common feature of tools is a polished working edge on the tool. In the past it was a debate of whether or not the polish was as a result of abrasion and the formation of residue buildup on the stone surface it- self. However this paper will discuss the role of phyto- liths specifically silica plays in polish formation. Using Highland flint blades, secured in a wooden hafted handle, we cut a variety of plants for a set amount of time. These plants ranged from high silica concentration to low con- centration. The reason for this is to see if concentration of silica has an impact on the rate that abrasion occurs on stone tools used for a set duration of time. This enables us to better understand the various ways in which silica affects the microsurface of the stone blades. Resilience, Coping, and Mental Health in University Students Ashley Crowder, Psychology Sponsor(s): Professor Gabriele Oettingen, Psychology There has been a major increase over recent years to make mental health and wellbeing a global reality in the higher education setting. This study sought to investigate the prevalence of psychological distress among universi- ty students, with a focus on identifying protective factors that may influence mental health. An online survey was conducted of 291 undergraduates at New York University, including 70 international students, to assess their demo- graphics, life events, resilience, coping self-efficacy, ac- culturation, and psychological distress levels. The results showed that women had higher rates of psychological dis- tress than men, while domestic students had higher rates of distress than international students. Moreover, psycho- logical distress was positively correlated with stressful life events and negatively correlated with protective factors such as resilience and coping self-efficacy. Regression modeling confirmed gender, residence, life events, resil- ience, and coping self-efficacy as unique contributors to the variance (R\u00ac = .38) in psychological distress. These findings highlight the importance of protective factors in promoting mental health and wellbeing among university students and suggest that university efforts to strengthen these skills can be effective in reducing psychological dis- tress. Medicare Coverage as a Determinant of Trust in Government Lincoln Dow, Politics Sponsor(s): Professor Christopher Dawes, Politics; Professor Amy Catalinac, Politics Barnet and Phyllis Liberman Research Scholar Trust in government has declined significantly in the U.S. and worldwide in recent decades. Satisfaction with public services and perceived government perfor - mance are among the most important predictors of trust 35in government, so positive experiences with government programs may bolster the image of government and in- crease an individual's trust. Because one of the most ubiquitous U.S. social programs is Medicare, this study assessed whether becoming eligible for Medicare benefits at age 65 results in higher levels of trust in government with a quasi-experimental regression discontinuity de- sign. Trust is measured both explicitly, using survey data from the American National Election Studies, and implic- itly, using an implicit association test (IAT). No Medicare treatment effect or discontinuity in trust was identified at age 65 from either measurement type. IAT results do show an apparent increase in trust at age 67, allowing for a possible lagged effect of Medicare that compounds with program use. Community Linkage Approaches for Integrating Hypertension and HIV Care in Lower-Income Countries: A Scoping Review Adrian Duah, Social & Cultural Analysis, Africana Studies Sponsor(s): Professor Gbenga Ogedegbe, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Department of Population Health; Professor Angela Aifah, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Department of Population Health This research aims to explore the strategies of adoption and sustainability in managing hypertension among people living with HIV in lower-income countries. Hypertension (HTN) is prevalent among people living with HIV , and its management requires a comprehensive approach that considers the social, economic, and cultural context of the affected population. Strategies to control Hypertension in people living with HIV are sorely need- ed. Physician shortage and poor access limit Nigeria's ca- pacity to control HTN in primary health centers (PHCs), where most PLWH receive care. Access to care and task-shifting of duties to nurses which may mitigate these barriers. The study employed a mixed-methods approach, including a systematic review of existing literature and a STROBE literature review, a survey of healthcare provid- ers through facilitating a community learning workshop series with nurses and community health workers in Nige- ria, and in-depth interviews with people living with HIV and hypertension. The study recommends the develop- ment of tailored interventions that prioritize: community involvement; capacity-building; creating an enabling en- vironment for the private sector to invest in clean cooking solutions; and partnerships between healthcare providers, local businesses and organizations, and policymakers to ensure sustainable hypertension management among peo- ple living with HIV in lower-income countries.The Ideological Differences in Assessing Merit: Disentangling the Role of Effort vs. Output in Judgments within Educational Contexts Maddy Dupee, Pompeu Fabra University Collegiate Research Scholar How do people judge the concepts of equity and merit as they're accentuated in reward systems, specifical- ly in educational contexts? How does ideology and culture influence these judgments as well? While previous litera- ture has suggested that people highly value effort, there is less research regarding these judgments within common educational contexts, such as in course reward criteria. This study presents participants with two educational syl- labi that are manipulated to emphasize either their aca- demic effort or the final excellence of their production. In the syllabus that emphasizes effort, it highlights the importance of the \"effort\" one commits to their final as- signment and in the syllabus that emphasizes excellence, it highlights the importance of the \"academic quality\" of their work. After reading the syllabi, participants judge both the fairness and overall value of the course. There was a statistically significant main effect of people find- ing the \"excellence\" syllabus to be fairer (n=259). People who were not born in the U.S. also found the \"excellence\" syllabus to have more value and engagement while people with higher incomes found the \"excellence\" syllabus to be more organized. These results provide insight into how people judge the components of equity in an educational syllabus, with greater weight seemingly being given to a syllabus that values final excellence over effort. Addition- ally, distinct cultural and class differences also guide how people evaluate these components, warranting further ex- ploration of these factors. Subjective Citizenship: Effects of Identity Salience on Civic Engagement among Sub-Saharan African Immigrants Monique Ezeh, Politics Sponsor(s): Professor Christopher Dawes, Politics Harold E. Akselrad Esq. Research Scholar Political scientists have suggested many potential causes for the relatively low levels of political participa- tion among naturalized and non-naturalized immigrants. Despite the plethora of suggested causes, there are still gaps in the data that suggest other contributing factors re- main unaccounted for. With this in mind, this project seeks to investigate the salience of connection to one's coun- try of origin as a potential contributing factor to the low levels of civic engagement among immigrants, honing in on the relatively understudied population of Sub-Saharan African immigrants. While many previous studies of this topic rely on observational data drawn from existing da-36tabases, this project instead uses an experimental design to operationalize the input and outcome variables via a survey experiment with treatment and control groups, priming half of participants with their connection to their country of origin to, hopefully, illuminate a causal rela- tionship. I hypothesized that increased salience in one's sense of connection to their home country would dimin- ish their potential political participation within the United States, operationalized as questions about hypothetical future political behaviors. I found that increased salience of connection with immigrants' country of origin did not significantly impact levels of potential political participa- tion in the United States, though the effect may have been lessened by limitations in the experimental design. Still, this illuminates a remaining gap in understanding political behaviors among immigrants, especially those from the relatively understudied group of Sub-Saharan Africans. Substance Use, Delusional Jealousy, and Personality Disorders: Male Perpetrators' Dynamic Risk Factors in IPV Recidivism Economics Sponsor(s): Professor Karen Miner-Romanoff, Sociology; Professor Lynne Haney, Sociology Dr. Molly S. Geller Research Scholar Intimate Partner Violence(IPV), also known as domestic violence, is abuse or aggression that occurs in a romantic relationship. IPV is a serious health concern in the United States.Though intimate-partner violence ac- knowledges all types of personal intimate relationships, regardless of gender, IPV is still gender-based violence. To reduce IPV recidivism, I will introduce the concept of the risk factors of IPV , factors that are associated with a higher likelihood of recidivism. Based on the difference in the pace of change, risk factors can be divided into static and dynamic risk factors. In this paper, I will main- ly examine the dynamic risk factors of intimate partner re-abuse occurring in male perpetrators and female sur - vivors. As clinical interventions can only target dynamic risk factors, I will explore dynamic risk factors and ad- vise on treatment programs. Among the several dynamic risk factors for violence that previous researchers have discussed, I will focus on substance abuse and mental disorders, including delusional jealousy and personality disorders. To narrow IPV recidivism down, I will include sexual, physical, and psychological re-abuse as measures of IPV recidivism. Though different studies use different sources to study IPV recidivism, such as police officers' reports or victim/batterers' responses, I will try to analyze and accommodate them. My analysis of dynamic risk factors will be valuable to community organizations that design treatment programs. Risk factors vary and a \"one- size-fits-all\" solution can't be applicable to IPV . Thus, Perpetrators with different profiles would benefit from different types of intervention. Professionals, Politics, and Shaytels: Being a Litvish Woman in 21st-Century America Audra Fried, Anthropology Sponsor(s): Professor Faye Ginsburg, Anthropology In this project I explore how a group of Jewish ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) women bridge traditional and modern worlds as they follow religious gender expec- tations and pursue successful careers. Most research on Haredi women defines their lives only in relation to male exploitation, by focusing on those who experience sex- ual trauma or leave the community (although there are some notable exceptions, such as Fader 2009, Zion-Wal- doks, 2022, Kaufman 1995, and Seidman 2009). While important, these stories offer a narrow understanding of how Haredi groups other than the most stringent and in- sular express and transform gender. From April 2022 to April 2023 in Passaic-Clifton, New Jersey, I interviewed thirteen women who predominantly practice Litvishism, a form of Haredi Judaism that places great emphasis on intellectual engagement with the Torah. My interview- ees included six Haredi-born women, and seven Jewish women who were raised secular and became Litvish as adults. Drawing on our conversations, I trace ideological relationships between pronatalism, cultural conservatism, and the concept of gender complementarity in halakha (Torah law). I contextualize my analysis within my ex- perience as an outsider interacting for the first time with Haredi gender practices. As Litvish women assert gen- dered power through halakhic observance, they navigate and reimagine what it means to be a Jewish woman every day, continuing the ethnic project Ashkenazi Jews have cultivated for generations. Looking at Own-Race Versus Other-Race Faces across Infancy Serena Fu, Psychology; Lisa Zhu, Psychology; Andrew Mota, Psychology Sponsor(s): Sophie Arnold, Psychology; Professor Marjorie Rhodes, Psychology Jack Sitt Research Scholar How does an infant's environment shape their at- tention to own- and other-race faces? Young infants in racially homogeneous environments tend to look longer at own-race than other-race faces. However, the com- plexity of these behaviors may be highlighted through the potential interference of external factors, such as social environmental diversity. Thus, our study intends to under - stand how infants from diverse social environments look at same- and other-race faces across their first two years. We sampled 203 three- to fourteen- month old infants to participate in the experiment remotely through PANDA, 37an online recruitment organization. Each infant was pre- sented with pairs of visual stimuli in a random order, and each pair was composed of two photographs of faces be- longing to unique racial/ethnic backgrounds. The racial/ ethnic groups included were White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian. Using the Datavyu program, the looking patterns of each infant were observed frame-by-frame and coded as \"left,\" \"right,\" \"center,\" or \"offscreen.\" Data from each of the infants was collected at 3-month intervals until in- fants reached twenty months old to examine whether vi- sual attention changes over time. Our research ultimately aims to highlight the significance of social environmental diversity on infants' attention to own- and other-race faces and study the development of an infant's perception of race. The American Dream: A Critical Analysis of the Rockingham Indians' Acculturation Nonexistence' Sponsor(s): Professor Aisha Khan, Anthropology; Professor Lou Cornum, Social & Cultural Analysis Russell and Diane Hawkins Research Scholar This project is inspired by my grandmother, Hi- awatha Goins, who is not only my main source of schol- arly and ethnographic insight, but also a key subject being that she is the oldest known living descendant of John Gowens. This research is an attempt to assess the tech- niques, behaviors, and practices of the Goins family, as an Afro-Indigenous Melungeon group. In doing so, I aim to further explore identity construction as ethnically mixed people. Moreover, I am interested in the flexibility of the Goins racial and ethnic identity that yielded more adaptive and safer living. This project has connected the aforemen- tioned survival techniques, strategic identification, and identity construction through a framework I denoted as 'acculturation'. For this project, I had a multi-disciplinary research approach - half of my data is archival work based on the Goins people, the other half is oral interviews with Goins descendents. Some conclusions are, the Goins peo- ple experienced a loss of culture, community, and land as a result of dispossessing their Afro-Indigenous Melun- geon identity and creating a racial and ethnic one rooted in ambiguity. I coined the term 'normative nonexistence' to describe the Goins acculturative tactic of protection through invisibility. Although they experienced loss, this predicated much gain. Perhaps, forgetting is the most necessary part of progress. Maybe ignorance is truthfully bliss. More likely, blankness leaves room for creation.Measuring the Executive Branch's Influence on the Allocation of Federal Dollars with a Continuous Independent Variable. Caroline Goetz, Economics Sponsor(s): Professor Timothy Roeper, Economics Does the Executive Branch award federal dollars in a politically motivated way? The current literature on distributive politics acknowledges the tendency of battle- ground states to receive more federal outlays by primarily using dichotomous variables to measure state electoral competitiveness. This paper highlights that battleground states vary in their electoral competitiveness and contrib- utes a new continuous metric, based on the likelihood of a 0% margin between the candidates in each state, to cap- ture the spectrum of state electoral competitiveness. Anal- yses with this new continuous metric on the geographic allocation of procurement contracts between 2008 and 2020 inclusive bolster the prevailing theory of the Execu- tive Branch's influence on federal outlays. The findings of this paper suggest that the most competitive state receives approximately 38.5% more per capita contracting dollars than the least competitive state, ceteris paribus. The find- ings of this paper also suggest that the most competitive state receives approximately 11.7% more per capita con- tracts than the least competitive state, ceteris paribus. The Influence of Parent-Child Communication on Gender Disparities in Service Jobs Anjali Golechha, Psychology; Ana Jean, Psychology; Mona Lebrun, Psychology Sponsor(s): Sophie Arnold, Psychology Collegiate Research Scholar There is a severe and persistent gender gap in the workplace, with women being overrepresented at the en- try-level but underrepresented at the upper levels. We in- vestigate the possibility that this disparity may be partially explained by parents approaching the topic of service dif- ferently with their sons and daughters. To test our hypoth- esis, our study drew upon a sample of 128 children aged 6 to 9 and their parents across the United States recruited through the PANDA database. The participants engaged in conversations about different service jobs and their as- sociated costs and benefits. Researchers transcribed these conversations and coded the four aspects of the content: individual cost, individual benefit, other-benefit, and oth- er cost. We anticipate that parents will be more likely to encourage their daughters to take on service jobs, empha- sizing the benefits and costs to the collective, whereas, when discussing service with their sons, they may em- phasize individual benefits and costs. Our findings allude to consistent differences between the way in which par - ents communicated with their sons and daughters about service--potentially leading women and girls to be more likely than men and boys to engage in service. These pre-38dicted results have practical significance because they highlight the importance of intervening with parents to encourage them to use more gender-neutral language when discussing service with their sons and daughters. By preventing the early formation of gender biases that can persist into adulthood and perpetuate the underrepre- sentation of women in upper-level positions, we can strive towards creating a more equitable workplace. Generic Language in Parent-Child Conversations about Racism and Children's Developing Racial Biases Aislyn Rose Gordon, Psychology; Sara Lizarazu, Psychology Sponsor(s): Professor Marjorie Rhodes, Psychology; Tobias Britton, Psychology; Michael Rizzo, Psychology Collegiate Research Scholar Parent-child conversations are a common way information is communicated throughout child develop- ment. Generic language (such as the sentence \"Boys like math\") is frequently used in parent-child conversations and can lead children to think that a category is mean- ingful and innately different from other categories. When referring to racial groups, this type of thinking may lead children to develop racial biases. This study examines parent-child conversations about race and racism, and how the use of generic language in these conversations relates to children's developing racial biases. Parents were given different topics related to race to discuss with their child and their responses were recorded and analyzed to see how often they used generic explicit racial labels (ex: White people). The generic labels used by each family were then compared to a survey the child completed prior to the conversation that measured the racial attitudes and biases of children. Our findings suggest that the use of ge- neric racial labels may lead children- especially younger children- to make essentialist assumptions about race and racial groups, and ultimately demonstrate more racial bi- ases. This study is the first of its kind to examine how the use of generic language relates to children's developing racial biases. Unearthing Nonconformity: Applying the Queer Lens to Prehistoric Europe through Sexing Practices Sydney Green, Dramatic Literature, Anthropology Sponsor(s): Professor Pam Crabtree, Anthropology Mary Rudie Barneby Research Scholar, William F . Weld Research Scholar in Ancient Studies While the question of gender in archaeology has been of interest to feminist archaeologists since the 1980s, queer archaeology and the questions of gender expressions and nonconformity in the record have been severely understudied. Though there have been excava- tions that result in \"queer\" findings, in other words find- ings that do not conform to sexual binaries (eg. a Finnish person with XXY chromosomes), there is no precedent to operationalize this body of work. My research creates a bridge between theory and method, forming what a queer archaeological framework could look like for prehistoric Europe-an area that has received essentially no inquiry. Rooted in a twenty-first century post-processual field of inherent and radical disassembling of contemporary pre- 39conceits and binaries, my research outlines a guideline for how and where to apply queer archaeology in the record of prehistoric Europe. Dealing with issues of the application of modern notions to past peoples and peoples (socially and/or biologically) who refuse binaries, this project grap- ples with our (modern) need to recognize the diversity of past peoples. It takes into account the role of queer ar - chaeology in the greater movement for a post-processual archaeology and how modern scientific archaeological practice can illuminate the queerness and thus full truth of our past. Queer people do and have always existed. How- ever, a queer archaeology cannot truly exist in the field unless we are open to questioning and queering the past. The Intergenerational Transmission of Social Essentialism: How Parents' Beliefs Influence Children's Beliefs Yunlai Gui, Psychology, Journalism Sponsor(s): Professor Marjorie Rhodes, Psychology; Dr. Yian Xu, Psychology Collegiate Research Scholar Why do most of us believe that boys love cars and girls love dolls? One explanation children might provide is that different social groups (e.g. boys vs. girls) are fun- damentally distinct from one another by nature. This line of thought reflects social essentialist thinking. Previous studies have been trying to understand how this belief de- velops in children. In the present study, we examine the role of parents in shaping these processes by exploring the direct relationship between parents' own social essen- tialist beliefs and children's essentialist beliefs in a natural setting. We recruited 280 American families through an online data collection platform. Children (3-5 years old) completed five essentialism tasks, each probing differ - ent components of children's social essentialist beliefs. Parents then completed a questionnaire about their own social essentialist beliefs. Parents' overall essentialism beliefs did not significantly predict their children's overall essentialism beliefs when compositing five components, but did specifically predict their beliefs about one sub- component - category homogeneity. In addition, parents' overall essentialism related more strongly to children's essentialist beliefs about a familiar social category than a novel social category. Our findings suggest that parents' essentialist beliefs can predict specific aspects of chil- dren's essentialist thought, rather than having a general influence on how children understand the social world. Future research should try to better dissect the influence of parents' belief on children's social essentialism in spe- cific aspects, and identify specific situations where par - ents' beliefs have a more significant influence.The Collapse of the Marriage Market in Rural China Hourui Guo, Economics and Mathematics; Keyi Luo, Economics and Mathematics; Yuanjin Zeng, Economics, International Relations; Yichi Yang, Economics and Mathematics Sponsor(s): Professor Xiaogang Wu, Sociology Collegiate Research Scholar The \"missing women puzzle,\" first brought up by Nobel Economics Prize laureate Amartya Sen, refers to the shortfall in the number of women in Asia. How- ever, few researchers have investigated its potential con- sequences. Our research team focuses on the missing women problem, represented statistically by sex ratios at birth (male at birth divided by female at birth), and one of its biggest consequences: how the missing women of the 1990s and 2000s affect the rural marriage market in China nowadays. Our research is divided into two parts: quantitative and qualitative research. Quantitatively, we found five out of the 31 provinces with the most unbal- anced sex ratios and focused on rural areas within these provinces. Through regression analysis and model selec- tion, we found rural males are hurt by unbalanced sex ra- tios, and the rural marriage market collapses, as shown by an approximately 2% higher male unmarried rate than females as the sex ratio increases. From qualitative aspects, we explored the social impact of the \"Missing Women Problem\": how imbalanced sex ratios and bro- ken rural marriage markets lead to antagonism between genders, a reduction in the birth rate, aging populations, and human trafficking. Thus, our research successfully demonstrates the causal relationship between unbalanced sex ratios and the shaky rural marriage market statistically and illustrates how these consequences of missing women endanger our society. We hope our research serves as a warning for people with gender discrimination and brings more attention to \"no gender-selective abortion\" and fem- inism from a socio-economic perspective. The Combined Effect of Aleatory-Epistemic Risk Perception and Prediction Confidence on Time-Series Investment Behaviors Yibo Hu, Economics, Psychology Sponsor(s): Dr. Jiin Jung, Psychology; Professor Gabriele Oettingen, Psychology Collegiate Research Scholar Paradoxical knowing denotes the phenomenon of people claiming they know something that is technical- ly unknowable to them. We constructed an experimental reality of the stock market to observe the change in the participants' portfolio risk preference over time under the influence of paradoxical knowledge. The study has found people with a higher belief in the market are fundamental- ly unknowable yet have high confidence in their predic- tion and tend to take on more risk over time regardless of 40their previous investment outcome. These people tend to persevere in their belief and develop a more radical stance which translates into riskier portfolio construction. The study has proven that people are trading under a strong psychological influence and do not act aligned with the risk-reducing strategy suggested by their risk perception mode of the stock market, which challenges the efficient market hypothesis and has potential implications for stock market modeling and prediction. Social Dominance Orientation and Political Ideology Shape Mental Representations of Inequality Whitney Hughes, Journalism, Psychology Sponsor(s): Professor Eric Knowles, Psychology Collegiate Research Scholar Research has shown that not everyone perceives or notices inequalities for different social groups to the same extent. Our study examines the ways in which inequalities and hierarchical relationships for different social groups such as social class, race, and political affiliation are per - ceived. We collected data from a sample of 172 under - graduate students. Participants completed an online map- ping task where they sorted different social classes, racial groups, gender identities, sexual identities, and education- al categories based on how much money they have, how good their jobs are, and how respected they are relative to each other. Results showed that those who are higher in social dominance orientation (SDO) placed these groups closer to each other, suggesting that they perceive few- er disparities existing between these groups. Those with more conservative social and cultural political ideologies also perceived less inequality. Future directions and im- plications will also be discussed. Comparison of Child and Adult Importance Ratings of 20 Individual Social Status-Related Dimensions Kathryn Jano, Psychology Sponsor(s): Professor Andrei Cimpian, Psychology; Dr. Vivian Liu, Psychology Walter and Phyllis Loeb Research Scholar This study examined children's and adults' percep- tions of the causal importance of 20 social status-related dimensions. Specifically, we investigated (1) what partic- ipants think is currently important for determining social status in America (i.e., descriptive), (2) what participants think should be important for determining social status in an ideal America (i.e., prescriptive), and (3) how partici- pants' descriptive and prescriptive importance ratings are related to ideas of meritocracy. We found a clear develop- mental shift in children's and adults' descriptive beliefs. However, prescriptive beliefs are largely solidified by the ages of 9- to 12-years-old and remain the same into adult- hood. For the descriptive beliefs, only children's impor - tance ratings were rooted in meritocracy: unlike adults, they believed that the dimensions that make individuals deserving of their higher social status do have importance in America today. For the prescriptive beliefs, children and adults were both highly meritocratic, demonstrat- ing that both age groups believe that the dimensions that make individuals deserving of their higher social status, should have higher importance in an ideal America. We discuss potential implications of this research for better understanding social status perception to prevent and re- duce bias in children and adults. Exploring the Need for Mandatory Sexual Health and Wellness Training among Second-Year Students Gianna Jirak, Global Public Health/Sociology Sponsor(s): Professor Marybec Griffin, College of Global Public Health Collegiate Research Scholar This study investigates how New York Universi- ty's lack of mandatorysexual health education classes affects its second-year student body. Specifically, it ana- lyzes how the lack of mandatory sexual health education affects students' abilities to apply safe sex concepts and students' knowledge of sexual health services on campus, as well as students' feelings about mandatory sex educa- tion classes. Participants in the study completed a 10-min- ute survey about the sex education they received in high school, their comfort with applying safe sex concepts (i.e. using condoms/dental dams, asking for consent, etc.), and their knowledge of sexual health services offered on cam- pus. Ten participants also completed a virtual interview where they were asked about similar topics. Of the 111 participants, 67 had been sexually active during their time at NYU, while 39 had not. Of the sexually active group, 25.4% indicated that the sex education they received prior to attending NYU did not prepare them to engage in safe sex, while 30.7% of the non-sexually active group indi- cated similarly. Furthermore, 54.1% participants indicat- ed that they were not confident in their ability to correctly use dental dams and 10.81% indicated a similar lack of confidence in their ability to correctly use condoms. 55% of participants, however, indicated that the implementa- tion of mandatory sexual health education would increase their comfort engaging in safe sex. 68.5% of participants also indicated that they believe mandatory sex education would be beneficial for the student body. Many partici- pants were also unaware of sexual health services offered at the Student Health Center, with 57.7% being unaware of STD testing, 76.6% being unaware of NYU's \"sex- pert,\" and 87.4% being unaware of PrEP services. Given the data, the implementation of mandatory sexual health classes would both make students more comfortable en- gaging in safe sex and likely make up for an educational default that is present regarding how to have safe sex and sexual health services offered on campus.41Social Class and Empathic Accuracy: Lower-class Advantages in Decoding Verbal Nonverbal Information Johnson, Psychology Sponsor(s): Nicholas Fendinger, Psychology; Professor Eric Knowles, Psychology Larry and Klara Silverstein Research Scholar Decades of research demonstrates that people's social class shapes how they engage with their social worlds. Further, people of lower social classes are better at interpreting their interaction partners' emotions and so- cial cues. Past research has only used still images to show the association between social class and empathic accura- cy. Here, we used dynamic stimuli to assess the associa- tion between lower social class and heightened empathy. We also examined how people of different social classes performed in manipulated conditions of social informa- tion (e.g., taking audio out of a video). Participants (N = 230) from five different social classes (poor, working, middle, upper-middle, upper) watched people describe emotional events in three types of videos. The three video conditions either included audiovisual (audio and video), nonverbal (only video), and verbal (only audio) informa- tion. Participants continuously rated how they thought the person in the video was feeling throughout the clip on a slider scale from \"very negative\" to \"very positive.\" To determine empathic accuracy, we regressed the person in the video's ratings of how they felt onto the participant's ratings. Lower social class participants more accurately interpreted the person in the video's ratings across all conditions. As social cues were removed from the videos in taking away audio or visual information, lower social class participants' accuracy declined less significantly than upper social class participants' accuracy. This finding highlights lower-class people's strengths in understanding others' emotions, even in the absence of essential social information. Power of Framing of Gender Disparities in Leadership Aminata Juwara, Psychology Sponsor(s): Professor Emily Balcetis, Psychology Collegiate Research Scholar Rates of female leadership in politics have in- creased by about 50% in recent U.S elections compared to a decade ago (Blazina & DeSilver, 2021). This increase has yet to reflect equal representation with women cur - rently holding 27% of the seats in Congress in a coun- try where they make up 51.4% of the population (Zaru, 2021).There has been great effort towards promoting a more gender inclusive professional world through pro- grams like Dress for Success and Girls Who Code. The goal of programs like these is to prepare girls to compete in male-dominated fields. Unfortunately, this objective fo-cuses on the absence of women in certain spaces and may contribute to gender disparities by absolving men of their role in the issue. The goal of this research study is to ex- plore whether this framing of gender disparity in leader - ship is limiting in its power to galvanize people. Building off previous research in my lab, I will explore the reac- tions people have to different frames. Given that anger is a motivating factor for action, I ask if changing the focus of gender disparity from women's underrepresentation to men's overrepresentation could elicit more anger, specif- ically among women of color? Framing inequality as the advantages enjoyed by the dominant group (i.e, men) in- stead of the standard framing of disadvantages endured by the subordinate group facilitates more engagement from women (Lowery & Wout, 2010). To see if this finding par - allels discourse in gender-leadership disparity I will mea- sure women's reactions to media depicting female-under - representation and male-overrepresentation . The Syntax and Pragmatics of Question-Response Pairs between Caregivers and Children with Autism Marion Kalina Heinrich, Linguistics Sponsor(s): Professor Ail\u00eds Cournane, Linguistics Daniel Getman and Leonard Marker Memorial Research Scholar Children with autism commonly experience de- layed language use, perhaps due in part to difficulty at- tending to caregiver speech. Linguistic delays and deficits may also be exacerbated by their caregivers simplifying their speech. In this corpus study, transcriptions and video recordings of 20 parent-child dyads were analyzed, with 10 autistic children and 10 typically developing children. Caregiver and child questions were coded for multiple syntactic aspects, such as question form (e.g. yes-no ques- tion vs. wh-question) and elicited syntactic response type (e.g. the question \"Who dropped the ball?\" elicits a noun phrase). Questions were also coded for their pragmatic function (e.g. requesting factual information), and child responses were coded for their sensitivity (or lack thereof) to the syntactic response types and pragmatic functions elicited by the questions. Autistic children and their care- givers asked fewer wh-questions, fewer questions with auxiliary verbs, and more fragment questions (questions without a subject and predicate) compared to typical- ly developing children and their caregivers. Caregivers of autistic children asked comparatively more questions about their children's feelings and desires and fewer ques- tions eliciting factual information. Although autistic and typically developing children displayed equal sensitivity to the syntactic constituents elicited by a given question in terms of their verbal responses, autistic children were unresponsive to caregiver questions in a pragmatically inappropriate manner more frequently than typically de- veloping children. The results suggest that caregivers of 42autistic children employ less grammatical complexity in their child-directed speech compared to caregivers of typ- ically developing children, which may contribute to how their children produce questions. What Contributes to Occupational Status? Investigating How Gender-stereotypic Job Attributes are Related to Perceptions of Occupational Prestige Cassie Kang, Psychology, Data Science Sponsor(s): Professor Madeline Heilman, Psychology; Hannah Eareckson, Psychology Collegiate Research Scholar Agency and communion are viewed as the funda- mental dimensions of content across many domains of psychological research, including gender stereotyping (Abele, 2003). Agency (or masculinity) refers to \"getting ahead\" and to individual goal-pursuit, while communion (or femininity) refers to \"getting along\" and to forming bonds with others. Although previous studies have exam- ined gender and perceptions of occupational prestige (e.g., Crawley, 2014), we know of no work that has attempted to study the relationship between occupational prestige and (1) gendered job attributes (agency and communion) vs. (2) actual gender representation. Current study aims to understand how gender is related to occupational prestige, according to both actual job representation and gendered job characteristics. We use O*NET job characteristics and CENSUS demographic information to examine whether gender representation or gendered job attributes account for more of the variance in occupational prestige. Partic- ipants were asked to rate the O*NET job characteristics on agency, communion, masculinity, and femininity. We find that masculinity and agency are positively correlated with median earnings, while femininity and communion are negatively correlated with median earnings. Howev- er, the results with perceived prestige are less consistent; agency (but not masculinity) is positively correlated with perceived prestige, while communion (but not feminini- ty) is negatively correlated with perceived prestige. The results suggest that gendered job attributes, particularly communal and agentic traits, have significant impacts on occupational status. Trade Spillovers & Counter-Terrorism: How Restrictions on Non-Immigrant Business Visas Affect Trade Flows to the United States from Developing Nations Julia Kempton, Economics and Computer Science Sponsor(s): Professor Sharon Traiberman, Economics Collegiate Research Scholar While the pandemic has certainly led to a substan- tial transition to remote work calls, in recent decades the travel of foreign employees to domestic meetings has be- come a hallmark of multinational corporations. Foreign businesses engaged in international trade regularly send representatives to other nations to source contracts, con- sult with suppliers, and study best practices. The United States, as one of the largest and most globalized econo- mies in the world, has long been a popular destination for this sort of business travel. However, the United States has far more restrictive visa requirements than other less developed countries, and has, for reasons ostensibly asso- ciated with terrorism or corruption (and often involving alleged prejudice), routinely blocked travelers, including business travelers, from developing countries and nations in Africa and the Arab world. The impact of deteriorating economic relations with several economic blocs (and a self-proclaimed \"trade war\" with China) under the Trump administration may also have led to further restrictions on business travel to the United States. This paper uses statis- tical analysis to explore disparities in the number of visas granted to business travelers over time by the US Depart- ment of State relative to the economic ties (e.g. exports/ imports) their country of origin had with the United States at that time. Panel results are considered across regions and economic strata from 1990 to 2020. Outcomes could in turn answer relevant questions about immigration re- strictions or colonial-esque investment structures. Generational Status and Attitudes towards Immigration Soofia Khaledi, Psychology Sponsor(s): Usman Liaquat, Psychology Collegiate Research Scholar This paper explores whether there is an ideolog- ical gap between first generation Americans and second or higher generation Americans in their attitudes towards immigrants and immigration. The function of generation- al status in creating this ideological gap is then questioned to see whether it is driven by second or higher generation Americans' more stringent prescriptive and more pessi- mistic descriptive beliefs about immigrants' general sys- tem justification. Do attitudes towards immigrants differ as a function of generational status? If yes, can this ideo- logical gap be explained by system justification motives? (i.e. prescriptive and descriptive beliefs). A total of 300 participants completed a survey that gauged their views on immigrants and immigration on Prolific Academic. A regression analysis revealed that while generational status does not seem to have an effect, political ideology does. Conservatism seemed to predict more stringent expecta- tions of immigrants justifying America's general system and more pessimistic views on how immigrants currently justify America's overarching political, social, and eco- nomic systems. Keywords: immigrants, immigrant gen- erational status, prescriptive beliefs, descriptive beliefs, system justification theory43Dose of Skepticism: How People Decide to Get Vaccines Mashrur Khan, Sociology Sponsor(s): Professor Ruth Horowitz, Sociology Collegiate Research Scholar As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, vaccinations against this virus have been a primary source of contro- versy and debate in the United States. While vaccine hes- itancy is certainly not a new debate in this country, the tremendous impact of Covid on daily life, the healthcare system, and politics has caused this issue to resurface. The emergence of various Covid vaccines has contributed to more political and personal polarization within the United States, bringing to light how difficult it is to contain the ef- fects of the virus if everyone thinks so differently about it. How do people make decisions about whether to get vac- cinated? The research question for this project is \"what factors do people take into account in their decision-mak- ing process about vaccinations?\" Specifically, I am inter - ested in seeing how people interpret and understand some healthcare workers' refusal to get the Covid-19 vaccine, and how that is related to their trust in government agen- cies like the CDC, health policy, and science research. The goal of this project is to gain new insights into how peo- ple's ideas of vaccinations are influenced by factors such as education, gender, religiosity, political affiliation, and, importantly here, experience with healthcare workers and workers' vaccine views and actions. Based on synthesiz- ing all of the results together, I found that Democrats and Republicans emphasize different sources of trust. Howev- er, for both groups, close social ties were the most import- ant and most determinant factor in how people decided to get vaccines, and this also mediated their perception and trust in the government. Cross-Cultural Recognition of Emotional Expression in the Voice: Implications for Pre-Health Students and Clinicians Maariyah Kharal, Global Public Health/Chemistry Sponsor(s): Professor Celia Stewart, Communicative Sciences and Disorders Collegiate Research Scholar This study explored the vocal characteristics of emotional expression common between English and Ar - abic. To investigate this, four speakers produced seman- tically-neutral sentences using emotions common in clin- ical settings. Arabic was chosen as the language of focus due to the stigma surrounding Middle Eastern cultures in the United States. By including Arabic in the study, it was anticipated that American clinicians could use the study results to better understand emotional expressions of pa- tients who primarily speak Arabic and provide more cul- turally-competent care. Acoustic analysis was performed using Praat freeware to examine the mean fundamental frequency (F0), range of F0, use of vocal fry, and pitch for emotions in Arabic and English samples. The mean F0 for sadness, happiness, and neutrality in Arabic were high- er and the mean F0 for anger was higher in English. The 44range of F0 for sadness and happiness in Arabic was larg- er than in English the range of F0 for anger and neutrality in Arabic was smaller than in English. The presence of vo- cal fry in Arabic and English expressions of sadness was equal. V ocal fry is used more commonly than not in both Arabic and English expressions of anger. V ocal fry was uncommon in Arabic expressions of neutrality and hap- piness but was common in English expressions of these emotions. The significant variance in vocal characteristics of emotional expression between Arabic and English has important implications for clinical practice. If clinicians actively recognize that features of expression are not uni- versal, misunderstandings regarding patients' sentiments can be avoided. Eib!: How a Culture of Shame Keeps People in Jordan from Accessing the Help They Need Samaa Khullar, Journalism, Middle Eastern Studies Sponsor(s): Professor Ted Conover, Journalism Collegiate Research Scholar From the metropolitan capital city of Amman to the overpopulated Azraq refugee camp, fear of stigma and honor systems in Jordan has left those experiencing do- mestic violence, mental illness, and addiction to suffer in silence. This thesis investigates how certain phrases, reli- gious beliefs, and cultural values impact those who have been branded by the term \"Eib\" or \"shameful.\" Several new facilities are opening up across the country, but peo- ple are still choosing to forego treatment due to stigma. Within the country's older population there is also the no- tion that therapy is a purely Western concept - a \"made- up,\" selfish practice that is a waste of time and money. Gender, class, marital and refugee status are also signifi- cant barriers to treatment, with many unable to access af- fordable services, and others terrified to leave their homes for fear of domestic violence or deportation. Doctors and social workers are now working on ways to change the language surrounding these topics, and opening up spaces for affected people to heal without fear of social isolation and this thesis explores some of these developments and progressive approaches in a relatively conservative soci- ety. Misplaced Certainty and Simple Thinking Kirill Kiselev, Neural Science, Psychology Sponsor(s): Professor Irmak Okten, Florida State University, Psychology Collegiate Research Scholar Recent work has shown that misplaced certainty, that is, the certainty that is not substantiated, can be epis- temically threatening. This threat may trigger defensive reactions such as determined ignorance and heightened aggression. Specifically, misplaced certainty was shown to leave people blind to relevant facts and to trigger hos-tility toward those who doubt one's certainty or deem it wrong. The present research investigates another poten- tially problematic outcome of misplaced certainty: sim- plistic preferences and evaluations. We suggest that mis- placed certainty may come with a preference for what seems to carry a simple (clear and easy to process), and thus unthreatening message. With an epistemic threat em- bedded in this certainty mentality, those who embrace it may like the world to be simplistic and make simplistic and potentially biased evaluations in various life domains (e.g., when trying to understand others and communicat- ing with them). We predicted that misplaced certainty would relate to a tendency to choose simplistic options and perspectives over complex ones in various life domains. Three studies investigated the hypothesized relationship. In Study 1 (pre-registered), we examined the relationship between misplaced certainty and the preference to give a simple (vs. complex) speech in an uncertain situation. In Study 2, we examined whether misplaced certainty relates to simplistic artistic preferences; specifically, whether those with high misplaced certainty prefer simple (Kitsch) paintings rather than complex (Avantgarde) ones. In Study 3 (pre-registered), we examined whether misplaced cer - tainty relates to more simplistic perceptions of others (i.e., dichotomous thinking). In all these correlational studies, we conducted robustness tests to confirm that the hypoth- esized relationship between certainty and the preference for simplicity is unique to misplaced forms of certainty (i.e., not generalizable to well-placed certainty). Trait Dependency and Narcissism in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Anastasiia Korolevskaia, Psychology Sponsor(s): Professor Lawrence Ian Reed, Psychology John and Julia Lindsey Research Scholar Personality disorders are inherently interpersonal in nature with most prominent symptoms occurring in the context of social interactions; however, few studies on personality disorders have investigated interpersonal be- havior in laboratory settings. The present study aimed to assess the submissive and selfish behaviors characteristic of dependent and narcissistic personality disorders using game theory. In Study 1, participants played a 10-round iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game against an imaginary partner who either (1) always defected or (2) cooperated once and then always defected. In Study 2, participants played a 10-round iterated Prisoner's Dilemma against an imaginary partner who either (1) always cooperat- ed or (2) defected once and then always cooperated. In both studies, the participants' trait levels of dependency and narcissism were measured. We found that dependent traits were positively associated with cooperation when the participants were invested in the cooperative relation- ship, but they became negatively associated with coop-45eration after repeated defection (Study 1). We also found that dependent traits predicted an increased likelihood of cooperation when the partner defected once but then co- operated for the rest of the game (Study 2). Surprisingly, narcissistic traits were positively associated with cooper - ation across iterations when playing against an exploit- ative partner (Study 1). These findings suggest that people high in trait dependency are more forgiving of a partner's choice to defect until they realize that the defection does not abate. These findings support the idea that social behaviors characteristic of dependency can be modeled using economic games. A Global Fight: Drawing Comparisons between the Use of Social Media in Black Lives Matter and Women, Life, Freedom Daria Kowalski, Politics, Psychology Sponsor(s): Professor Karen Karbiener, Global Liberal Studies The powerful effects of social media on protest are realized in both the Black Lives Matter Movement (BLM) and the Women, Life, Freedom Movement. By comparing these movements, this project will depict how social media enables a movement to transcend the biases and politicization of traditional media to give it a global voice. The ongoing fight against police brutality gained large-scale attention following the circulation of a graph- ic video of George Floyd's death. I will examine how a similar phenomenon occurs in the Women, Life, Freedom Movement. Women's rights have been an ongoing fight in Iran since the 1979 Revolution when the country transi- tioned to Shariah law, which included a compulsory hijab law. When the world saw through social media that Mahsa Amini died under the custody of the \"morality police\" for wearing her hijab improperly, this intensified the ongoing fight for Iranian women's rights. I posit that social me- dia and protest are what have, and will continue to, drive the Women, Life, Freedom Movement forward. Drawing comparisons between the Women, Life, Freedom Move- ment and BLM shows that social media has become a use- ful tool to spread awareness, but it can also be weaponized to quell revolutions. Regardless, people who have been indifferent now see the harsh reality that black people and Iranian women face. Since the 2010 protests in Iran, over 7,161 people, including 68 minors, have been executed, so the world is called to action to amplify the voices of Iranian women fighting for their lives.Gender-Marked Messages Effect Beliefs about Who Does and Who is Good at an Activity Maya Kreitman, Psychology Sponsor(s): Professor Andrei Cimpian, Psychology; Professor April Bailey, University of New Hampshire. Psychology Collegiate Research Scholar Women are systematically underrepresented in sci- ence, technology, engineering, and math. This dispropor - tionate representation has broad consequences, sparking efforts to attract women into male-dominated domains. One such approach involves using messages that empha- size gender in that domain (e.g., \"Coding for Girls''). Un- fortunately, these well-intentioned messages may back- fire; female-marked messages have been shown to make girls think that the domain is less for girls, whereas male- marked messages make boys think the domain is more for boys (Bailey & Cimpian, in preparation). A limitation of this work is that girls responded only to female-marked messages and boys responded only to male-marked mes- sages. Is the observed difference in responses because girls think differently than boys? Or, do all people reason differently when presented with female-marked vs. male- marked messages? We introduced participants to novel ac- tivities that had either a named or gender-marked champi- on, using a design with all combinations of participant and champion gender. We queried participants' beliefs about which gender participates more, and has greater ability, in the activities. Use of a gender-marked champion made participants believe that the marked gender both partici- pated less and had less ability in the activities. Moreover, the use of a gender-mark negatively impacted partici- pants' beliefs about participation in the activities when the champion was female-presenting but not male-presenting. We failed to find evidence that the use of a gender-mark impacted participants' choice of activity. These findings highlight the need to further explore the consequences of gender-marked messages to inform interventions for in- creasing girls' engagement in male-dominated domains. A Post-Industrial Atlas of Yemeni Buffalo, NY Rohan Lalla, Social & Cultural Analysis Sponsor(s): Professor Thomas Sugrue, Social & Cultural Analysis; Professor Tyson Patros, Social & Cultural Analysis Giuseppe Astorina Research Scholar For this thesis I created a community profile of the Yemeni-American neighborhood of Lackawanna, NY to assess the effects that surveillance, deindustrialization, and cultural disorientation have had on Muslim-Ameri- can placemaking. Lackawanna was a newtown created by its namesake, the Lackawanna Steel Company. Originally populated by East European and Irish day laborers, Ye- meni immigrants arrived in Lackawanna in the 1950s to 46send remittances back to their families, who would later follow them when immigration was liberalized in 1965. As deindustrialization began in 1982, some were able to shore up their resources in informal lending mutuals to buy small grocery stores and delis. Others became casu- alties of neoliberalism. In 2002, the FBI found evidence of the first found homegrown terrorist \"sleeper cell\" since 9/11 in Lackawanna and arrested 6 men on charges relat- ed to their visit to Al Qaeda training camp Al Farouq in Afghanistan. The case had dubious legal underpinnings, and all men were sentenced to 10+ years. My research questions include how people, particularly young men, become susceptible to reactionary ideologies like politi- cal Islam. I also explore interrelated topics like how Islam came to dictate Middle Eastern politics despite the region having strong secular institutions 60 years ago. What are the legacies of the War on Terror in a U.S. foreign policy paradigm which no longer locates great power struggle within the threat of future terror attacks? In Lackawanna, how did the domestic arms of the national security appa- ratus in the form of the FBI and the Joint Terrorism Task Force carry the mantle of U.S. empire abroad, and how might they have moved counter to it? How are moral and existential panics instrumentalized to break down civil liberties, particularly for criminalized minorities? Guns and Glory: Gun Culture, Nationhood, and Citizenship on Facebook Samantha Lewis, Sociology Sponsor(s): Professor Bart Bonikowski, Sociology; Professor Ruth Horowitz, Sociology Sidney Feldshuh & Lillian Kaplan Feldshuh Research Scholar Few political issues in America today are more divisive than gun control, an issue understood to largely fall along party lines and considered dependent on per - sonal experience or contact with gun ownership and use. But, more is relevant to the conversations about guns in America than these factors. Sociologists have long stud- ied America's gun issue in conjunction with right wing groups, domestic terrorism, themes of masculinity, and nationalism. Gun-control organizations have not received the same amount of attention. My research seeks to fill this gap by studying both gun-rights and gun-control or - ganizations' social movement framing through the lenses of nationhood and citizenship. Drawing on observations and analyses of two organizations' Facebook pages, Na- tional Rifle Association and Everytown for Gun Safety, I examine: What understandings of nationhood and cit- izenship do pro gun-rights and pro gun-control organi- zations evoke in their framing of America's gun issue? The National Rifle Association uses their understanding of nationhood and nationalism to frame the gun issue as an issue of freedom and infringement of individual rights. Everytown for Gun Safety illustrates an understanding of American nationhood as in need of improvement and col- lective safety as a necessity of the realization of freedom. With this in mind, I argue that each organization's advoca- cy involves their own distinct conceptions of nationhood and citizenship, creating conflicting versions of America and driving the larger conversation about America's gun issue. The Impact of U.S. Sanctions on Political Support for the United Socialist Party of Venezuela Austin Li, International Relations Sponsor(s): Professor Peter Rosendorff, Politics; Felipe Balc\u00e1zar, Politics Collegiate Research Scholar While various nations have been negatively affect- ed by sanctions, oftentimes we see that the sanctioned incumbent governments remain in power and enjoy a de- cent level of support despite the economic hardship facing the country. This is the case in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, where, despite the U.S. financial sanctions imposed, the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) has held onto power. I argue that while municipalities greatly dependent on the state-dominated oil sector were economically harmed by U.S. sanctions, citizens in those same municipalities were more likely to vote in favor of the PSUV-led government. I theorize that this is due to the fact that it is a foreign power harming the citizens of the target government, not the target government itself do- ing so. Using municipal-level mayoral elections in 2017 and 2021 across the 335 municipalities of Venezuela, this study finds that the closer one is located to a municipality with at least one oil refinery, one is more likely to vote for the PSUV when sanctions are in place, demonstrat- ing a rally-around-the-flag effect toward the incumbent government. This study has important implications for the effectiveness of targeted sanctions and helps deepen our understanding of when and where the rally-around-the- flag effect may appear. The Operationalization of Community Mobilization in Managing Hypertension in Lower-Middle Income Countries: A Scoping Review Sarah Li, Global Public Health/Biology Sponsor(s): Professor Angela Aifah, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Department of Population Health; Shivani Mishra, NYU Langone Collegiate Research Scholar In recent decades, low- and middle-income coun- tries (LMICs) have been witnessing a significant shift to- ward raised blood pressure. Only 1 in 3 are aware of their hypertension (HTN) status, and only around 8% have their blood pressure controlled. In order to successfully manage and prevent HTN, engaging those living with or 47at risk of HTN and their respective community networks is important. There is evidence showing that communi- ty mobilization strategies have engaged and galvanized community members to take action towards achieving improved infectious disease outcomes. However, it is unclear how CM has been defined within the context of HTN as a non-communicable disease, and how it has impacted HTN in LMICs. For these reasons, a scoping review was conducted in order to systematically map the operationalization of CM and its corresponding impact on HTN control. Third Child Policy and Fertility Intention: What Factors Influence the Decision to Have Children for Couples in China? Anny Liu, Sociology Sponsor(s): Professor Lawrence Wu, Sociology; Professor Ruth Horowitz, Sociology Collegiate Research Scholar This study reflects on the limitations of the three- child policy and analyzes the factors that influence Chi- nese couples' fertility intentions through a quantitative study of an online questionnaire (n=1016). In general, the three-child policy has not yet had a significant impact on people's fertility intentions, while the low fertility inten- tions in China as a whole are mainly due to the weakening influence of traditional attitudes, the strengthening de- mand for childcare resources, and the fact that women still face multiple challenges in the domestic, work field, or even the whole society. To further increase China's fertili- ty rate, the government should not only focus on housing, subsidies, and childcare policies that are directly related to childbirth, but also consider enacting policies that will improve the unequal status of women in the workplace, and promote the idea of women's emancipation in society by calling on husbands to participate in household chores and childcare. An Investigation on the Separate Contributions of Agency-Communion Perceptions and Male-Female Representations on Job Prestige Zhiheng Liu, Psychology; Cassie Kang, Data Science Sponsor(s): Professor Madeline Heilman, Psychology; Hannah Eareckson, Psychology Collegiate Research Scholar The fundamental agency and communion content dimensions are pervasive in psychological theorizing in many research fields. Agency is characterized by qualities relevant to goal attainment, focusing more on pursuing individual goals, while communion is characterized by qualities relevant to the establishment and maintenance of the social relationship, focusing more on belonging to social groups (Abele et al, 2016). The present study ex-perimentally manipulates occupational agency and com- munion, as well as gender representation, to examine the causal relationship between these factors and occupation- al prestige. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the four conditions and will be presented with screen- shots of web pages that simulate job descriptions on the O*NET Online database. The descriptions will provide information about jobs' gender ratio and required work characteristics to manipulate perceived gender representa- tion and the gendered nature of the job tasks (either agen- tic/masculine or communal/feminine). They will be asked to rate the occupational prestige of the job based on the job descriptions and estimate the median earnings - two different measures of occupational status. The impact of perceived gender ratio and gendered work requirements on occupational status will be examined through ANOV A tests. Combating Hate: A Mixed Method Research on Asian American Volunteer Groups Under New Waves of Hate Crimes Yilin Luo, Sociology Sponsor(s): Professor Jacob Boersema, Sociology; Professor Ruth Horowitz, Sociology Myron Kove Research Scholar Racially motivated hate crimes against Asian Amer - icans have always existed in the United States. However, the recent Asian American community response against the rise in hate crimes during Covid-19 has been unique in its scale and scope. In this research project, I studied an Asian-based antiracist group in New York City to analyze the workings of these groups, the antiracist ideals of their members, and their impact on Asian American identity formation. Furthermore, my project aims to reveal how we can explain this response and its relationship to Asian American community building and racial consciousness through in-depth interviewing of 10 Asian American vol- unteers' Covid-19 volunteer experience and participant observation, where I experience the typical volunteer activity. My findings suggest that Asian American volun- teer organizers in New York City de-emphasized race. In- stead, they advocated diversity in recruitment and adver - tisement patterns for groups formed under Covid-19 and served Asian Americans. However, these Asian American volunteers knowingly reinforced their racial identities through the volunteer groups' long-lasting socializing and networking functions. In my conclusion section, I also offer suggestions derived from my analysis for types of possible local community-building volunteer services to prevent the spread of hate crimes designed uniquely for Asian American communities. By conducting this re- search, I illuminate how outside events such as pandem- ics and racism shape Asian Americans' sense of collective 48identity and racial consciousness, which deserves more attention in sociology than it currently receives. A Markov Chain Simulation of Infinitely Repeated Prisoner's Dilemma Jinhan Luo, Economics and Mathematics Sponsor(s): Professor Guillaume Frechette, Economics Collegiate Research Scholar The Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game is a crucial model of Game Theory. It has been frequently studied by economists, mathematicians and social scientists to mod- el and predict human behaviors. In one-shot PD games, defection is always the dominant strategy. In infinitely re- peated PD games, each pair of players interacts for infinite rounds, with some constant discount rate. This continuous interaction between the same pair of players encourages cooperation. The Markov chain is a time-homogenous probability chain, and is useful in strategies in which the current action depends on the outcome of the previous round. This project uses the Markov chain to model in- finitely repeated PD games played by rational, risk-neu- tral players. It searches equilibrium strategy profiles, and studies the necessary conditions to sustain such equilibria. A Moran process model is used to explore the robustness of equilibria in a population mixed with players using dif- ferent strategies. This project finds the limitations of using the Moran process model in economic games, and shows that pairwise strategy evolutions cannot predict the result of evolutions involving more than two strategies. The Effect of Collective Narcissism on Attitudes towards Immigrants Nahusha Madhusudan, Politics, Psychology Psychology Drs. Mayank and Amita Patel Research Scholar, Pudding Hill Research Scholar Past research regarding attitudes towards immi- grants has largely focused on the forms of threat that host-nation members feel towards immigrants who do or do not culturally assimilate. While this research says these threats are felt differently by members of the host-nation population along ideological lines, it does not explain why. Here we assess whether Americans' negative atti- tudes towards immigrants can be explained by disposi- tional variability in collective narcissism related to their American-national identity (i.e., the motivation to see the U.S. as superior to other nations). We explore whether this dispositional variability can explain why some Americans are more concerned about immigrant cultural assimilation than others. In Study 1 (n=521), participants were ran- domly assigned to read an article depicting Middle East- ern immigrants as either assimilating or not assimilating into American institutions. Participants were then asked to fill out a questionnaire regarding their feelings towards their native country (to measure their American-national collective narcissism), as well as their attitudes towards the immigrant group presented in the article. In Study 2 (n=520), an identical methodology was employed but participants were randomly assigned to read an article de- picting Middle Eastern immigrants as either assimilating or not assimilating into American culture. Using multiple regression and simple slopes analysis, we found that par - ticipants who were high on collective narcissism felt more negatively towards Middle Eastern immigrants who did not assimilate in both studies. This study has implications for what does and should drive American immigration policy. Passion vs. Practicality: How NYU Students Choose Their Major Zoe Makler, Sociology, Public Policy Sponsor(s): Professor Ruth Horowitz, Sociology Collegiate Research Scholar Although nearly 40% of Americans aged 18-24 are currently enrolled in college, this number has de- clined steadily over the past decade. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and skyrocketing tuition prices have caused many Americans to rethink their post-graduation educational decisions. Despite overwhelming research indicating that a college degree will on average lead to more future financial success, which specific degree may dictate how much impact a college degree will have on a person's future. In my honors thesis project, I will con- duct a series of qualitative interviews to delve deeper into how and why college students select their major and what factors influence this life-changing decision. Although mentors, educators, and parents often encourage students to follow their passions, sometimes these interests do not line up with realistic future career paths. Thus, some peo- ple may have to pivot to more practical majors in order to secure a job that will pay enough to allow them to pursue their passions. Moreover, some people's personal and ac- ademic passions do not align, causing an internal conflict about how they should devote their time while in college. While a traditional four-year college differs from voca- tional school and certainly serves as a period of individual growth and identity formation, one cannot discount the importance of not only the degree, but the academic rigor that accompanies it. How do Young Infants Categorize Scenes? Kirsten Mark, Psychology Sponsor(s): Professor Moira Dillon, Psychology; Dr. Yi Lin, Psychology Collegiate Research Scholar Categorization helps infants learn about the world around them. Past research found that infants can cate-49gorize objects when labeled with novel nouns (Ferguson & Waxman, 2017), especially if the objects are similar in shape (Graham et al., 2004). Prior work, however, has focused only on objects, leaving out another key spatial domain of infants' everyday experience: scenes. In this study, we ask whether 6 and 12-month-olds can catego- rize scenes using noun labels and spatial layout in a nov- elty-preference paradigm. In Experiment 1, 6-month-olds were familiarized to a series of natural scenes (e.g., open fields) accompanied by a made-up noun label (\"Look, a snuz!\"). At test, infants viewed two side-by-side scenes presented in silence, one new example from the famil- iarized category and one example from a novel category (e.g., closed canyons). 6-month-olds looked longer to the novel scene category at test, suggesting they successfully categorized. Experiment 2 was identical to Experiment 1, except infants saw artificial indoor scenes that isolat- ed spatial layout information (i.e., dome-shaped vs. rect- angle-shaped rooms), controlling for color and texture. 12-month-olds, but not 6-month-olds, showed a difference in looking preference at test, suggesting 6-month-olds are unable to categorize scenes using spatial layout informa- tion alone. Due to the ambiguity of scenes in Experiment 2, Experiment 3 is underway to test if 6-month-olds can use shape information alone to categorize artificial out- door scenes (e.g. dunes vs. canyons). In Experiment 4, scenes will be accompanied by tone sequences to test whether language is necessary for scene categorization. Race in Healthcare Hamleini Martinez, Global Public Health/Sociology Sponsor(s): Professor Ruth Horowitz, Sociology Collegiate Research Scholar The demographics of the country continue to rap- idly change as the increasing number of health disparities in underrepresented ethnic groups are identified. The fu- ture of healthcare relies on the diversity of healthcare pro- fessionals and their ability to obtain a medical degree. The following study was conducted on 24 female participants who attend New York University (NYU). Participants were asked a series of questions to determine whether a lack of racially diverse medical doctors contributes to ra- cial disparities in healthcare. This research mostly focus- es on race and the personal experiences of participants. My argument is that many participants will feel that ra- cial disparities in healthcare do exist because of how they are perceived by medical professionals of a different race than them. These perceptions can lead to negative biases and stereotypes which will ultimately have an impact on the treatment that participants receive. Overall, my data shows that racial disparities do exist in healthcare because some doctors do not understand what it is like to be of a different race and go through predisposed health struggles which will eventually lead to racial medical disparities. Whereas doctors of a similar race as you can understand these struggles and will resonate with your experiences when trying to come up with a course of action for your diagnosis Exploring the Efficacy of MoCA Score Corrections and Norm Replacements in Reducing the Influence of Race/Ethnicity Rachel McCray, Psychology Sponsor(s): Professor Arlener Turner, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami Collegiate Research Scholar The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is the most commonly used tool to assess global cognition and cognitive impairment. However, research shows sig- nificant differences in test score distributions across races/ ethnicities. Part of these differences could be attributed to structural disparities in access to and quality of educa- tion. In order to narrow this disparity, the MoCA current- ly adds an additional point for those with \u00e2\u00a712 years of education. Here, we chose to examine whether the MoCA corrections for education curb racial differences. Specifi- cally, in Black/African American participants, the correla- tion between years in education and MoCA performance is much stronger; suggesting that years of education is a greater determinant of assessment performance. We ex- plored the efficacy of using different normative data in reducing the influence of race/ethnicity on possible mis- diagnoses of cognitive impairment. We used information from the Washington Heights/Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP) dataset, which compiles norms from Black and Latino populations, as compared to the tradi- tional MoCA norms, which were historically created from predominantly white populations, and do not account for influences related to race. We compared traditional MoCA norms with more demographically adjusted norms, utiliz- ing the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uni- form Dataset (NACC UDS), to see how impairment se- verity level distribution changes. We saw a decrease in diagnosed impairment when switching from cutoffs deter - mined by MoCA norms to more demographically adjust- ed norms. This study demonstrates how potential overre- liance on formal education skills in assessments results in possible overdiagnosis of impairment in low literacy participants of color. Abused and Disempowered: How Traditions Set Up Pakistani Women for Violence, or Worse Alisha Meghani, Politics, Journalism Sponsor(s): Professor Ted Conover, Journalism; Professor Robert Boynton, Journalism Eileen Guggenheim Research Scholar Across the diverse landscapes of Pakistan, from bustling urban centers like Lahore to the rural dispersed 50populations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a pervasive atmo- sphere of violence against women prevails. This thesis embarks on a comprehensive exploration of the implica- tions of Pakistan's qisas and diyat laws on women in nu- merous regions of Pakistan, unraveling their far-reaching impact on women's rights within the country. It delves into the historical context and legal framework that treat grave offenses like murder and domestic violence as pri- vate disputes, casting light on the stark realities faced by women in Pakistan. Notable experts intimately involved in this critical issue lend their insights and perspectives, enriching the study's analysis against the backdrop of the current women's rights landscape in Pakistan charac- terized by persistent challenges and gender inequalities. This thesis also delves into the transformative power of the Aurat March, which has emerged as powerful cata- lysts for change. Moreover, this study amplifies the voic- es and experiences of victims of violence, ranging from high-profile cases like Asma Rani and Qandeel Baloch to lesser-known instances, highlighting the widespread impact of Pakistan's patriarchal society. With a narrative approach that weaves together personal stories and narra- tives, this thesis compellingly encapsulates the intricate dynamics surrounding violence against women's in Pa- kistan and their profound ramifications. By thoroughly exploring these interconnected facets, this thesis aims to deepen the understanding of the challenges faced by women in Pakistan.Pragmatic Categorization of Homophones in Chinese Cyberspace Zoey Meng, Anthropology, Psychology Sponsor(s): Professor Sonia Das, Linguistics George Maker Research Scholar Homophones are an important element of Chinese language, literature and culture. Traditionally, homo- phones have been used as a device for humor, sarcasm, euphemisms, and wordplay. In the modern Chinese cyber - space with increasing governmental control and expand- ing taboos related to social and political events, homo- phones have also become a primary method for netizens to circumvent text-detecting censorship mechanisms in addition to retaining its traditional functions. While past linguistic anthropological studies have focused on study- ing homophones as an example of language resistance at the early beginning of online censorship in the early 2000s, this study aims to examine the pragmatic functions of homophonous internet slang and discuss the socio-cul- tural-political factors behind the surge of the use of homo- phones in the public sphere in recent years. on selective examples of homophones, including their literary and conversational contexts, tones and moods, and effects. All discussed examples are widely used across different social media sites and came into use in the year 2019 or after, a year that marks the Hong Kong protests as well as the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subse- quent turmoil in the Chinese political and social environ- ment. I propose and provide examples for four pragmatic functions of homophonous internet slang: homophones as a way to circumvent text-detection censorship, homo- 51phones as euphemisms for avoiding language taboos, ho- mophones as a literary device for social commentaries, and homophones as internet memes and humor. \"The work of a depraved soul\": How Newspaper Articles Talk about Disability and Mass Shooters from 1991 to 2022 Eden Seran Min, Sociology Sponsor(s): Professor Ruth Horowitz, Sociology; Professor Alex Barnard, Sociology Nathan Ende Research Scholar My research is a content analysis of 300 newspaper articles covering mass shootings in America. I specifically investigate the discussion around perceived disability of the perpetrator and compare this with other description patterns that newspapers use to characterize the perpetra- tor. For each of the 12 mass shootings I sample, I ana- lyze 25 articles published within one month of the given shooting. I use a 73-item binary coding grid to track the evolvement of language and discussion around psychiat- ric disability and the shooter. Some major themes of the shooter that I read for include mental health, perceived disability, family context, past behavior, socioeconomic status, alcohol and substance use, and criminal record. I find that the average mention of a shooter's negative men- tal health remains consistently relatively low, and trend oppositely of mentions of the shooter being \"crazy\" or \"evil.\" Gun control and mental health policy are increas- ingly discussed over time, while the mention of alcohol and substance use trends downwards across the decades. School shooters are connected to violent media and music more than non-school shooters. Medical Mistrust in Reproductive Health: Comparing the Experiences between Black, White, and Latinx Women Nayeli Moronta, Global Public Health/Sociology Sponsor(s): Professor Ruth Horowitz, Sociology; Ananda Martin-Caughey, Sociology Salant Family Research Scholar in Pre-Health Studies Medical mistrust in reproductive health care is a phenomenon that stems from the experimentation of Black female slaves for scientific and medical advancement in obstetrics and gynecology. Today, not only are Black women experiencing this type of mistrust in the medical system, but Latinx populations and White populations do as well. This article reveals that medical mistrust is heav- ily dependent on provider-patient relationships. I used qualitative data from 20 in-depth interviews with wom- en who racially/ethnically identify as Black, Latinx, and White, to compare their experiences during their prenatal and postpartum visits with their providers. The data was used to compare specific situations and relationships with providers between the different groups to make connec-tions regarding how medical mistrust is unveiled in each group. This research suggests that all racial/ethnic groups studied are affected by medical mistrust, however, Black and Latinx participants were more likely to distrust med- ical providers due to negative experiences with medical providers, whereas White participants were more likely to be concerned about the overuse of unnecessary medi- cal interventions during pregnancy. Medical mistrust has also led participants to utilize midwifery birthing centers as opposed to traditional OBGYN medical care. Due to the limitations of this study, it is not possible to determine whether medical mistrust is more prevalent in one racial group than the other, however, the findings of this study suggests that dismantling medical mistrust should involve placing an emphasis on creating healthier provider-patient relationships regardless of the patient's background. Education and Commodification, Approaches to Spanish Dual Language Learning Kayla Nappi, Spanish, History Sponsor(s): Professor Lourdes Davila, Spanish Ariel and Alaleh Ostad Research Scholar Can we define Dual-language (DL) learning in NYC as a commodity and in what way? How does this affect the ways in which schools advertise and incentiv- ize parents to choose this program for their children? In what ways has DL changed and been portrayed now, ver - sus when it was first established? For English Language Learners (ELLs), DL allows them to learn in their own language as they adapt to a system of education taught mostly in English; they also learn to recognize Spanish as an important resource that supports their cultural back- ground. For English speakers, DL is also a commodity, but in a very different way: at times it has been used to replace Gifted and Talented classrooms, or to advance their academic status within the school system. The pur - pose of my study is to research two different DL groups in the NYC public school system, one dominated mostly by ELLs and Spanish speakers and the other dominated by English speakers. I want to understand the ways in which dual-language programs now differ from their original de- sign and intent, and what this reveals about how parents made educational choices for their children. Has Span- ish learning and learning in Spanish been commodified through the DL programs for English speaking and Span- ish speaking audiences? My study includes: looking at variables such as the influx of native-English speakers in dual-language programs in recent years, the change in lo- cal and institutional legislature as well as the use of digital media and archives to present DL programs to prospective elementary school parents. Looking at these variables re- veals the demand and evaluative practices of Spanish-lan- guage learning in K-5 dual language programs.52Neighborhood Disparities in New York City EMS Response Riley Neher, Data Science Sponsor(s): Professor Julia Stoyanovich, Data Science Collegiate Research Scholar New York City neighborhoods vary widely in terms of their demographic profiles, income distributions, education levels, even levels of tree cover and air quali- ty. Disparities in service delivery across New York City neighborhoods have been studied extensively. However, to date no study has investigated neighborhood-level dis- parities in EMS response and travel times. In this study, I collected many different neighborhood-level features and merged them into one dataset. These features range from statistics about crime, to K-12 test results, to the level of graffiti in a neighborhood. I then merged this dataset with information about EMS calls made in New York City from 2011 to 2020. Using an F-test of joint significance and controlling for the date, time, and type of call, I found that the neighborhood features were significant in predicting both the response time of EMS dispatchers and the travel time of ambulances to the scene of a medical emergency. These findings suggest that the ability of an individual to get medical care quickly and safely in New York City is impacted by the neighborhood in which they live. The Perception of Video Evidence in Legal Proceedings Brooklyn Nguyen, Economics, Psychology Sponsor(s): Professor Emily Balcetis, Psychology; Jennie Qu-Lee, Psychology Collegiate Research Scholar The Bureau of Justice Assistance estimates that about 80% of crimes involve video evidence, including police-civilian altercations captured on patrol-car dash- boards and body-worn cameras. Despite the increasing use of video as evidence in legal contexts, the way people interact with these videos reflects their na\u00efve realism, be- lieving visual evidence reflects reality completely and ac- curately, and not questioning possible omissions from the video (Griffin & Ross, 1991; Feigenson & Spiesel, 2009). This gives video evidence strong cognitive weight (Bell & Loftus, 1985; Sherwin, Feigenson, & Spiesel, 2006). The magnitude of bias and confidence of resulting decisions about the culpability of in-group and out-group members may be stronger than it otherwise would be. Previous re- search has found that knowing the degree to which people identify with a social group is not enough for researchers to reliably predict the presence or direction of judgment bias. While viewing video evidence, the viewer's social identification interacts with their preexisting beliefs to influence where in the video visual attention is directed, all of which affects what conclusions the viewer draws from the evidence (Granot, Balcetis, Schneider, & Tyler, 2014). This begs the question then, what aspects of iden- tity give rise to bias after accounting for visual attention? This study tests intergroup biases in legal punishment de- cisions by having participants view video evidence and asking them to answer questions about proper legal pun- ishment for the perpetrators. This study seeks to explain why, despite looking at the same thing, people identifying with different social groups reach different conclusions about appropriate legal responses. Experiences of College-Age Students in the Transition from Pediatric to Adult Care Esofi Nunyi, Global Public Health/Sociology Sponsor(s): Professor Ruth Horowitz, Sociology Ravi and Nalni Saligram Research Scholar Think about a transitional stage in your life. Going through puberty? Starting a new school? Finding employ- ment? As we approach transitional stages in our lives, we need not only continue to figure out who we are and who we want to be, but also to do seemingly smaller acts such as find adult medical practitioners rather than pediatric. While this might be a seemingly small act, it could have major consequences for our healthcare decision-making and outcomes. For some, challenges may also present in finding a physician who \"looks like them\". A 2019 report from the AAMC concluded that among active physicians, 56.2% identified as White, 17.1% identified as Asian, 5.8% identified as Hispanic, and only 5.0% identified as Black or African American. Through virtual semi-struc- tured interviews, I investigated the perspectives and expe- riences of 13 black young adults varying ages 18 to 24 in their transition from pediatric to adult care. Criminalization of Rap/Hip-hop in the United States Fiyin Okeremi, Africana Studies, Psychology Sponsor(s): Professor Renee Blake, Social & Cultural Analysis; Professor Cecilio Cooper, Social & Cultural Analysis; Professor Cristina Beltr\u00e1n, Social & Cultural Analysis Collegiate Research Scholar Over the last few decades, rap has attracted repres- sive attention, from moralists, gatekeepers, and the law. From 1990 to 2017 there have been over 500 cases where rap lyrics have been used as criminal evidence in court (Nielson 2019). This number is both astonishing and trou- bling. Based on this, I ask the following questions: why is rap gaining this attention? What are some factors that contribute to rap being used in court? And lastly why is rap treated so differently in comparison to other genres? My work argues that the criminalization of rap is linked to the history of discrimination in Black music genres which are steeped anti-Black sentiments that date back to slav- ery. Furthermore, I contend that the intersection of race and the aesthetics of rap (Language and Black masculini-53ty) are factors that add to the criminalization of rap rather than its lyrical content alone. Through my work, I hope to discourage the use of rap lyrics as evidence in court as well as encourage policy reform to limit the circumstanc- es where rap lyrics are admissible. Influences of Multicultural Background: Crisis of Connection among Chinese Boys in America Irene Ou, Psychology Sponsor(s): Professor Niobe Way, Applied Psychology Crisis of connection refers to the fact that mascu- linity norms in American culture have been influencing boys' emotional development, posing challenges for them to remain connected to close relationships as they grow up. While research has been mainly focusing on boys growing up in American culture, masculinity norms are manifested variously in different cultures, and cultural backgrounds serve as important moderators of how male individuals experience masculinity norms. This research investigates how boys with multicultural backgrounds approach masculinity norms with regard to their rela- tionships. In qualitative interviews with 3 Chinese male college students who were born and raised in China and attended colleges in the U.S., questions were asked about their interpersonal relationships and their relationships with Chinese and American masculinity culture. Qualita- tive coding analysis of the interviews indicated that when encountering a new culture, cross-cultural experiences tend to influence how boys interact and interpret mascu- linity norms and their solution to the crisis of connection in terms of resistance and accommodation to masculinity norms. The Use of Structured Interviews in Mitigating Bias in Medical Resident Programs Anya Pabby, Psychology Sponsor(s): Professor Emily Balcetis, Psychology Collegiate Research Scholar The focus of my research was to determine if structured interviews during the medical resident hiring process were a fair way to mitigate bias. This is really important as the interview process is a crucial component to the resident hiring process, and it should be as fair as possible to ensure the applicants feel the decision was based purely on their medical abilities. A bias free pro- cess also benefits the interviewer, as they are able to make the most well informed decision and better their medical program. We worked with a non profit organization called Perception, which created structured interview questions that were given to medical residents applying to Mt. Si- nai. We received data from Mt. Sinai about the experience of both the doctors interviewing the candidates and the candidates during both structured and unstructured inter - views. We then compared the results. Afterwards, we de-briefed with each of the interviewing doctors, both in the structured and unstructured rooms to hear their feedback on the whole process and the strengths and weaknesses of the structured interviews. I then identified trends amongst each of the doctors in the feedback they were giving. A survey was also sent out to the medical residents who matched with Mt. Sinai and we were able to obtain their feedback as well. The Effect of Social Isolation as a Result of COVID-19 on the Behavior of College Students Akeylah Pamphile, Sociology Sponsor(s): Professor Ruth Horowitz, Sociology Collegiate Research Scholar Social isolation as a result of quarantining during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic had a signifi- cant impact on many of us. College is supposed to be a time in which a student's social life is at its peak, but the COVID-19 pandemic interfered with this for many stu- dents at NYU. This research aims to pay close attention to current NYU students, and how their behavior and ac- tions were affected by the pandemic. By conducting this research, the true nature of the effect of the pandemic will be revealed, and whether or not this effect is positive or negative will be analyzed. These results were obtained through a methodological approach of conducting twen- ty in-depth interviews and comparing data to statistics collected by previous research from notable Sociologists in regards to the effects of COVID-19 on humans. After analyzing the data collected from interviews, it has been revealed that some students dealt with heightened anxi- ety and even experienced depression during quarantine. Other students revealed that they have become more cau- tious due to the pandemic, and that they take more precau- tions in order to maintain their health. Many students also disclosed that they had a negative outlook on life during quarantine, whereas other students stated that quarantine caused them to have a positive outlook on life. Overall, the data collected for this research has alluded to the idea that social isolation as a result of COVID-19 has a signif- icant impact on the behavior of college students, and this impact has the potential to be both positive and negative. Using Artificial Intelligence to Predict Undernourishment in Country Clusters Saatwik Panigrahi, Economics, Mathematics Sponsor(s): Professor Anasse Bari, Computer Science Collegiate Research Scholar Undernourishment is one of the most pressing is- sues in developing and under-developed countries alike as they try climbing the ladder of economic development. Using k-means clustering, the paper segments 136 coun- tries into clusters and then aims to explore the efficacy of machine learning (ML) approaches in predicting the 54prevalence of undernourishment and identify the most im- portant predictors for that specific cluster. Neuroscience of Attention: Considering the Implications of Short-Form Digital Media for ADHD Pia Parekh, Gallatin Sponsor(s): Professor Daniela Montalto, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Child and Adolescent Psychology The annual number of social media users grows ex- ponentially, fueling media platforms to find ways to keep their users consistently engaged. Short-form videos, such as Tiktok videos, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts, utilize features like personalized \"For You\" streams and infinite scrolling mechanisms to keep their users' atten- tion. This technology has the ability to rewire the brain's reward circuitry, with the potential for long-term rewir - ing of the dopamine pathways in the prefrontal cortex. Such a change mimics symptoms of ADHD, which also affects the prefrontal cortex. There are a couple different hypotheses that support the idea that there might be a di- rect causational relationship between digital media use and ADHD. The \"scan and shift\" hypothesis is based on the idea that the rich stimulus of digital media, which pro- vides new content at a fast pace, encourages individuals to scan their environment quickly, an adaptive behavior. When present during the early stages of development, such as adolescence, this learned behavior is sustained even if it's no longer necessitated by the environment. Another theory maintains that digital media use might cause and perpetuate ADHD symptoms due to multitask- ing tendencies. Individuals might have trouble sustaining focus on a single task if they build a habit of switching between activities when using digital media.This poster presentation aims to outline the link between technology use, specifically short-form videos like Tiktoks and Reels, and ADHD symptoms. We'll look at technology's effect on the brain, ADHD in the brain, data supporting associ- ations between the two, and discuss implications of this data. A Preliminary Archaeobotanical Survey of an Iron Age Frontier Town: The Light Fraction from Area L, Tel Dan, Israel James Parrott, Anthropology Sponsor(s): Professor Lorenzo Castellano, Anthropology; Professor Pam Crabtree, Anthropology Collegiate Research Scholar Located in the fertile Hula Valley (33.249\u00b0N 35.652\u00b0E), the city of Dan served as the cultic center for the Northern Kingdom of Israel during the Iron Age, hosted the largest tributary of the Jordan River, and held a strategic location at its intersection with Damascus and Phoenicia (Thareani 2019). 9th century BCE biblical chronicles, corroborated by epigraphic sources and ar - chaeological evidence, tell of a politically and ethnical- ly diverse population in Dan prior to Hazael's conquest. While macro-botanical remains have been recovered from several excavations at Tel Dan, a systematic survey of the archaeobotanical assemblage has yet to be published. During the 2022 excavations, samples were systematical- ly collected from an Iron age (likely 9th century) archi- tectural complex in Area L via manual bucket flotation. These samples included unprecedented quantities of Mil- let (Panicum miliaceum), representing 64.9% of the total Iron age assemblage in a survey of a site from Western Asia. Furthermore, the absence of typical cereal remains such as the chaff from any samples indicates that the rooms surveyed from this architectural complex are likely not associated with raw cereal processing. Utilizing the irrigation potentials of the hula marshes and associated freshwater springs, demanding crops such as P . miliaceum were cultivated, with the former providing opportunities for a summer crop. The macro-botanical assemblage from the architectural complex in Area L likely reflects the di- etary patterns of a multi-ethnic, agriculturalist community with strong social organization and cooperation. Microcinemas: Marginal Moviegoing Practices in America Nicolas Pedrero-Setzer, Cinema Studies, Journalism Sponsor(s): Professor Robert Boynton, Journalism; Professor Ted Conover, Journalism Steffi Berne Research Scholar New York City's Regal Cinema Union Square an- nounced it would be shutting down on January 19, 2023, after the company declared bankruptcy the previous Sum- mer. \"Our purpose is clear: Screen Slate must purchase and operate Regal Union Square,\" wrote Jon Dieringer, founder and editor of the local film publication. Although he was being facetious, his comment prompted interest- ing responses and equally flippant talk of expropriation. Among these, one responder asked, \"The first microcin- ema multiplex?\" Microcinemas are small aberrations in the modern filmgoing landscape, best described by film scholar Donna de Ville as \"small-scale, do-it-yourself (DIY) exhibition venues.\" Historically speaking, these sites of alternative viewing have only shared one thing in common across America: transience. Yet, since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, many of these venues were able to hold on to their space, or remodel, since they were not held to the same financial standards as their commercial counterparts. \"The institutions are crumbling, but we're still around,\" said Tooth, founder of Black Hole Cinematheque in Oakland, California. This project explores the conditions that give rise to these art-spaces and sustain them. The story, plights and idiosyncrasies of these outsider cinemas remains under-examined and 55in reporting on them, the goal is to study how communi- ties form, what the function of independent art is against mass-market culture, and the meaning physical spaces hold for post-pandemic society? My reporting gathers a history of microcinemas alongside interviews with pro- grammers, owners, visitors, and volunteers in charge of today's strongest voices in the micro-community. Southern Hospitality for Whom? Local Queer- Targeting Measures in the American South Emily Pyle, Politics, Gender and Sexuality Studies Sponsor(s): Professor Ann Pellegrini, Social & Cultural Analysis; Professor Cristina Beltr\u00e1n, Social & Cultural Analysis Nicholas and Andrea Ferrara Research Scholar There exists a critical lack of localized queer his- tories of the American South in academic spaces. To help bridge this gap, this project tracks a series of nearly iden- tical resolutions passed by four local governments across South Carolina and Georgia between 1993 and 1996 that labeled the \"gay lifestyle\" as incompatible with commu- nity standards. I analyze the passage and aftermath of these resolutions, with a specific focus on the mechanics of organized gay resistance and Christian Right \"family values\" ideology. I center this project on the 1996 reso- lution passed in Greenville County, South Carolina - my hometown - which was the only county that did not re-scind or nullify its resolution before 1997, and instead only recently sunsetted its resolution in 2020. In position- ing this resolution within regional and national contexts, I create a comprehensive account of an event that had received very little academic research. This project addi- tionally theorizes Southern queer regionalism in relation to local queer activism in the South. Specifically, I present an understanding of the South that is structured not by ge- ography but rather by persistent myths and cultural imag- inaries that have misinformed how some view the South, including the harmful narrative that the South is a place that queer people must escape from as opposed to a place they call home - a home that many of us wish to keep. This project challenges these narratives and calls for an expan- sion of the queer archive to include more localized studies and promote the visibility of the Queer South. Mathematical Interpretation of China's Economic Outputs: The Role of Birth Rate in Economic Growth Yichen Qian, Mathematics; Ye Liu, Data Science; Qihang Xu, Mathematics; Jianan Liao, Economics Sponsor(s): Professor Timothy Christensen, Economics In this research, we looked for a relationship be- tween China's birth rate and its aggregate production. Based on preliminary findings, we examined the rela- tionship with a focus on evaluating the effectiveness of China's Family Planning Policy in maintaining economic 56growth. Our initial hypothesis is that China's large labor force supplied by its population is crucial in driving the nation's economic growth. We used panel data regression and fixed effect model to analyze the relationship between China's birth rate and its aggregate production, in hope for the results of this study to provide valuable insights into the role of birth rate in maintaining China's current economic growth and whether Family Planning Policy or other population policies are effective in preserving the basis of a nation's labor force. Associating the Surface Area of Cortical Visual Areas V1-V4 with Visual Crowding Performance Brenda Qiu, Psychology Sponsor(s): Professor Jonathan Winawer, Psychology; Dr. Jan Kurzawski, Psychology Collegiate Research Scholar Object recognition is a fundamental function of our visual system that enables everyday activities such as reading and driving. It is both enabled and limited by information processing in the brain. One important lim- itation is that when objects are close together (i.e., they are \"cluttered\"), their features can get combined in neural representations. This merge of information makes it hard to recognize individual items among the \"cluttered\" ob- jects. This is called \"visual crowding\". This study aims to investigate the cortical basis of visual crowding. In this study, we took a novel approach by associating the surface area of cortical visual maps to study the neural correlates of visual crowding. Visual maps were measured by manually delineating boundaries of visual areas based on retinotopic maps. Visual crowding was measured psy- chophysically as the minimum distance between the tar - get and flanker stimuli where observers achieved criterion performance. We measured surface area of the V1, V2, V3, and hV4 maps as well as crowding distance in the same 48 human observers. We found that visual crowding performance is predicted by the surface area of hV4 (r = -.61, p < .001), but not V1, V2, or V3. Observers with larger hV4 had smaller crowding distance and performed better in visual crowding. Our finding indicates that hV4 acts as a bottleneck for recognition in clutter. Because of the correlation between the size of hV4 and visual crowd- ing, the size of hV4 could also serve as a biomarker for visual health, such as dyslexia and amblyopia. Realization of [b] and [v] Sounds in Spanish for Simultaneous Bilingual English/Spanish Speakers and Spanish/L2 English Speakers Andrea Rodas, Linguistics, Journalism Sponsor(s): Professor Lisa Davidson, Linguistics Jack Sitt Research Scholar It is established knowledge that the Spanish pho- netic inventory lacks the /v/ sound. Instead, when a word includes the letter \"v\", as in the word \"vaca\" (cow) or in the word \"vino\" (wine), it is said that Spanish speakers produce that letter as a [b] or as a [] in an environment where spirantization occurs. Previous studies show that some individuals do in fact pronounce words spelled with \"v\" as a labiodental fricative [v], instead of the expected plosive [b] or approximant []. This study ex- plores the differences between the realization of [b] and [v] sounds in Spanish for early English/Spanish bilinguals currently living in New York City, specifically focusing on simultaneous bilinguals and sequential bilinguals. Par - ticipants were recorded and asked to pronounce a list of target words starting with \"b\" and \"v\" in both word-initial and intervocalic environments. The spectrograms were analyzed to determine what phoneme the words were pronounced with as well as their duration. Results indi- cate that there is a difference between the rate at which simultaneous speakers and sequential speakers realize /b/ as a [v], specifically in word-initial positions when spelled as \"v\". Simultaneous speakers used [v] 12% more of the time. Results showed that in intervocalic environments however, both groups of bilinguals used [v] at the same rate. Intersectional Stereotypes Study Lee-Ann Rushlow, Psychology Sponsor(s): Professor Madeline Heilman, Psychology Collegiate Research Scholar As described by Fiske, Cuddy, and Glick (2007) in their stereotype content model, competence and like- ability are perceptions that can be fundamental in mak- ing distinctions between social groups. This study aimed to expand upon the stereotype content model by looking at valenced gender stereotypes and their influence on perceptions. This is highly relevant since stereotypes of intersectional identities are not necessarily the additive combinations of the respective race stereotypes and gen- der stereotypes. In this study, we surveyed perceptions of intersectional combinations of race-Asian, Black, Latine, and White and female-and with dif- ferent age groups-20s, 30s, and 40s. Stimuli included 72 faces, drawn from the Chicago Face Database (CFD). The tested stereotypes included instantiations of positive femininity-warmth, negative femininity-passivity, gressiveness-alongside neutral perceptions-competence and likeability. Participants were presented with 24 face stimuli, and asked to rate these adjectives on a likert scale of 1-7 for each. We utilized a diverse sample, using 500 MTurk participants through the CloudResearch recruit- ment platform. For ratings: Competence: Asian and Lati- na women were rated significantly higher than Asian and Latino men. Warmth: Asian men and Latina women were rated significantly higher than their gender counterparts; 57in contrast, White men were rated significantly lower than White women. Assertiveness: strong significance in Asian and Black women being rated higher than Asian and Black men; White women were found to be rated higher than White men with significance. Passivity: Asian men were rated higher than Asian women and Black women were seen as less passive than Black men, significantly. Dom- inance: Asian women, White women, and Black women were found to be significantly rated higher than their male counterparts. Likeability: there was strong significance in Latina women rated higher than Latino men, and Black men were rated significantly higher than Black women. Recycling Behaviors in New York City Fabiola Sanabria Chaverri, Economics Sponsor(s): Professor Karl Storchmann, Economics Frances and Benjamin Benenson Research Scholar Despite New York City's authorities' effort, only one fifth of the city's garbage is currently recycled. Un- derstanding the determinants of waste collection and re- cycling behavior is essential to achieve environmental sustainability in New York City. The motivation of this research comes from the heterogeneity in waste manage- ment performance across community districts. This re- search uses 2007-2021 data on New York City community districts to analyze the impact of social-economic factors on recycling behavior. By using a large panel dataset that observes New York City community districts, this paper investigates how recycling rates are correlated with a wide set of community district level variables. My findings show a positive correlation between income and educa- tion level with recycling rates, but an inverse relationship for refuse collection. The study also studies tendencies variations according to the community district's popula- tion sizes and population of kids. This empirical analysis helps identify those community districts that have higher probability of being virtuous in terms of waste recycling, and the factors that drive recycling in New York City. NYC Transit Bus Infrastructure and Inequities in Particulate Matter (PM) Exposures Impacting Demographic Minorities Sevastian Sanchez, International Relations, Public Policy; Inti Robinson Campbell, Economics, Mathematics Sponsor(s): Dr. Carlos Restrepo, Public Policy Horace Wendorf Research Scholar It has been previously found that negligence and often deliberate wrongdoing in urban planning has con- tributed to lower-quality air affecting lower-income neigh- borhoods, disproportionately populated by demograph- ic minorities (Spieler, 2020). We hypothesize that New Yorkers who rely more heavily on MTA buses for daily commutes \u2014 mainly encompassing ethnic/racial minori-ties, disabled and elderly populations \u2014 also inhale the largest share of particulate matter (PM) from bus exhaust and often for long extended periods of time depending on their commute. This project holds an important place in understanding the underlying difficulties in access to ad- equate opportunities and services for underprivileged and underserved populations. Our goal is to achieve concrete results in order to begin the search for solutions to bridge this gap in air quality and transportation access, potential- ly through the use of renewable diesel fuel. Using posted transit ridership data and tools like EJScreen and Policy Map, we strategically map out various bus stop locations and various commuter routes that travel within Manhat- tan and commuter routes that travel within the outer bor - oughs. We plan to personally test the level of particulate matter in the air by activating portable PM monitors along recreated commute trajectories on public transportation. The air-quality data we'd collect would allow us to com- pare routes and bus stop locations and attempt to answer the question of whether there are significant differences in PM commuter exposure at bus stops depending on station locations: are bus commuters residing in underserved lo- cations exposed to more PM at bus stops compared to bus commuters residing in more affluent communities. The Modal Horizon Sees Free Choice Leila Sandlin, Linguistics Sponsor(s): Professor Chris Barker, Linguistics Disjunctive sentences with modal operators in En- glish, like Jan can eat an apple or a pear, seem to imply that Jan can eat an apple and that Jan can eat a pear, depending on which one Jan prefers. This phenomenon where the disjunction or behaves conjunctively under the scope of a modal operator can is known as the Free Choice infer - ence. Free Choice is a major point of divergence between the formalisms used in semantics and language as it's used in actuality. There are two main strategies in address- ing these inferences: those that reformulate the semantic truth-conditional meaning of either the modal or the dis- junction, and those that consider the pragmatics. Both ap- proaches are attempting to reconcile the pragmatic nature of these inferences with their systematic behaviors. This paper adapts an independently-motivated theory of Nega- tive Polarity Item (NPI) licensing from von Fintel (2001), supplementing it with the Lewis Sphere of acceptability from Lewis (1979), to give an account for the Free Choice inference.58The Role of Workers' Insurance in Economic Efficiency during Epidemics Stuti Saria, Economics, Mathematics Sponsor(s): Professor Alberto Bisin, Economics Marie and Anthony Rao Research Scholar This research examines the role that insurance can play in reaching social efficiency in an epidemic hit so- ciety where agents and firms are required to maximize utility and profits, respectively, while facing a complex system of externalities in consumption and production. We examine this in the context of a simple model of an economy and solve for its general equilibrium which is the outcome of two optimal choices: consumers' choic- es of leisure and consumption to maximize their utilities subject to their budget constraint and firms' choices of production and abatement measures to maximize their profits We study how different degrees of workers' insur - ance affect the behavior of consumers and firms which, ultimately, affect the overall level of infections in the so- ciety. Finally, we extend the analysis in order to determine the socially optimal combination of abatement measures taken by firms and leisure decisions made by consumers that minimizes the overall probability of infections in the society. The results suggest that infections in the econo- my are likely to be least widespread when workers' wages are partially insured because higher abatement measures taken by firms combined with agents choosing to devote a lower amount of time to leisure activities will lead to lesser social interactions. These results are beneficial, es- pecially in motivating policy to design insurance markets with the best possible welfare properties and will help de- termine the characteristics of a market that works on a Pareto optimal level in the context of the given model of the economy. Does Adolescents' Gender Predict Their Mental Representation of the Leader Role? Siyang Shen, Psychology Sponsor(s): Professor Emily Balcetis, Psychology Collegiate Research Scholar Despite progress towards gender equality, wom- en remain underrepresented in leadership positions. This underrepresentation can be attributed to role congruity bias: the idea that mental representations of leaders do not include female characteristics. This study aims to in- vestigate the mental representations of leadership held by adolescent girls and boys, examining their differences in exhibiting role congruity bias. The study uses a unique avatar-based task to elicit and evaluate the characteristics of leaders. Participants freely create avatars of their ideal leaders, providing a concrete manifestation of their men- tal image. The study also explores the role of stereotype threat as an explanation for gender differences in creating mental representations of leadership. Stereotype threat refers to the fear of conforming to a stereotype. and it particularly affects girl adolescents in the leadership case. Results show that girls create leader avatars with signifi- cantly more feminine characteristics as compared to the avatars created by male adolescents. This suggests that girls have higher motivation to combat role congruity ste- reotypes. These results have broader implications for un- derstanding the cognitive and social processes underlying the development of leadership mental representations. In addition, these findings may inform interventions and pol- icies to combat discrimination and may help to promote gender diversity in leadership and reduce gender dispari- ties in salaries. The Trans Threat is an Aesthetic Threat: Gender Variance, Dress, and Contemporary Judaism Hannah Siegel, Sociology Sponsor(s): Professor Ruth Horowitz, Sociology Ellie and David Werber Research Scholar in Social Sciences It has been nearly 30 years since Judith Butler maintained that gender is \"a corporeal style, an act'... sustained through social performances\" (272). It has been even longer since \"[t]he classic rabbis spoke with an almost singular voice...Jews must dress distinctive- ly\" (Silverman 177). Contemporary Jews navigate their daily lives--including the choice of which mitzvot to keep and which religious garments to wear--within both of these frameworks. Trans and gender non-conforming Jews in particular must decide which gendered religious and modest skirts--to discard or retain while honoring their desired gender expression. They must choose a desired level of observance towards (or new interpretation of) Jew- ish religious law, or halacha. They must choose how to 'dress Jewish' while also choosing how best to 'do gen- der,' all the while gauging the approval of their temples, social circles, families, rabbis, partners, the Divine, and themselves. This project investigates how contemporary Jews--Reform, Reconstructionist, Conservative, and Or - thodox--choose religious garments within specific and intersectional social contexts. With a sample of 26 Jews from across the United States and various gender iden- tities, this study uses qualitative in-depth interviewing to compare methods of social smoothing, virtue-signaling, ritual, and identity expression among religious trans and gender non-conforming Jews.59Breadwinning Preferences: How Gender Dynamics Alters One's Desire to Select into and Earn for a Team Jordan Simpson, Economics Sponsor(s): Professor Ernesto Reuben, NYU Abu Dhabi, Social Sciences In today's world, collaboration is key to success in many settings, from the office to our personal relation- ships. But what drives individuals to choose teamwork over going it alone? This paper explores the existence of a 'pure' teamwork preference among individuals and in- vestigates whether this preference differs by gender. Ad- ditionally, it also examines the salience of the male bread- winner norm outside of the conjugal unit, testing if the gender of one's teammate changes how much responsibil- ity for earning an individual wants within a team. Using a novel specialization task, where 112 subjects allocate paid and unpaid puzzles between themselves and their partner, I find evidence that a 'pure' preference for teamwork ex- ists among individuals, with women exhibiting a stronger preference for teamwork than men. Moreover, women's teamwork preference is significantly stronger when paired with a male teammate, while men's teamwork preference is not affected by the gender of their partner. When paired with a male partner, women opt to take on less of the 'breadwinning' role for the team compared to when paired with a female partner. In contrast, men prefer to take on more of the 'breadwinning' role when paired with a fe- male partner compared to a male partner. These findings highlight the importance of gender dynamics in shaping teamwork preferences and have important implications for workplace policies and practices. Follow My Eyes: Social Class Indices and Their Association with Spontaneous Gaze Sharing Adelina Simpson, Psychology Sponsor(s): Nick Fendinger, Psychology Varet Family Research Scholar Social class is a potent social context that shapes our attention to others (Dietze & Knowles, 2020). How- ever, the extent to which social class predicts intersubjec- tive attention - the often spontaneous attempts to adopt the perspective of others - has yet to be adequately explored. In the present study, we recruited 107 undergraduate stu- dents who completed a novel visual attention task to test the association between social class and spontaneous gaze sharing. Specifically, participants were instructed to detect a dot that either appeared on the left or right side of their computer screens. Critically, a face appeared just before the dot that was either looking to the left or right. We be- lieved that if participants shared the gaze of this face, that they would be faster at detecting dots that appeared where the face was initially looking, but slower at detecting dots that appeared on the opposite side of where the face was initially looking. A series of linear mixed-effects models indicated that across different conceptualizations of social class, lower social class was associated with a greater ten- dency to spontaneously share the visual gaze of a face. Implementation of Community Mobilization as a Preventative Factor of Hypertension in Africa Emeryc Sogbossi, Global Public Health/Anthropology Sponsor(s): Professor Gbenga Ogedegbe, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Department of Population Health; Professor Angela Aifah, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Department of Population Health Although uncontrolled Hypertension (HTN) can be caused by unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, exposure to Household Air Pollution (HAP) is associated with el- evated Blood Pressure (BP). Improved Cook Stoves (ICS) technology have proven efficacy on reduction of HAP and improved health outcomes which can in turn, reduce rates of HTN and other Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs) amongst populations in Sub-Saharan African (SSA). This scoping review explores how adoption strat- egies in LMICs can be maintained or sustained, and of- fers recommendations for future policy and public health considerations. Peer reviewed articles that reported on the maintenance and adoption of cookstoves through CM were included for review. Eleven studies met the criteria. Suggested approaches included (1) Financing options on ICSs; (2) Television and radio shows promoting cleaner cooking methods; (3) Behavior based strategies to shift outlook on adoption of ICSs and; (4) Sales training of fe- male entrepreneurs. Sexual of the Sacral Auricular 3-D Geometric Morphometrics Analysis Carly Stark, Anthropology Sponsor(s): Professor Scott Williams, Anthropology Collegiate Research Scholar The human pelvis shows marked sexual dimor - phism that is thought to stem from the conflicting selec- tive pressures of bipedal locomotion and parturition. The sacrum is thought to reflect this dimorphism as it makes up a significant portion of the pelvic girdle. However, report- ed sexual classification accuracies vary considerably de- pending on the method and reference sample (54%-98%). This project aims to explore this inconsistency by quan- tifying sexual dimorphism in a geographically heteroge- neous sample by utilizing 3D geometric morphometrics to examine sexual dimorphism in the auricular surface of the sacrum. While previous studies have investigated the au- ricular surface using 3D geometric morphometrics, none have exclusively analyzed the auricular surface using sliding semilandmarks on curves. The geometric morpho- metric analysis was based on 8 landmarks and 20 sliding semilandmarks on curves collected on the left and right auricular surfaces of each sacrum. Our sample consists of 6058 archaeological individuals, in contrast to the modern samples typically used. The goal of this research is two- fold: to benefit forensic techniques for sexing individuals and to contribute to the knowledge of bony pelvis features relevant to human birth. With maternal and infant health remaining a major global concern, investigating the evo- lution of birth and human morphology is a pressing mat- ter. This study aims to provide valuable insights into the sexual dimorphism of the auricular surface of the sacrum, and how it may impact the birthing process. Do Mayoral Candidates Moderate Their Political Ideology for the General Election? Anthony Sukotjo, Computer Science Sponsor(s): Professor Bryant Moy, Politics Collegiate Research Scholar My study investigates whether mayoral candidates moderate their political ideology throughout the election season, as evidenced by the content of their campaign websites. Focusing on New York City mayoral candidates from 2013 to 2021, this research aims to contribute to the understanding of city-level elections and more static on- line communication channels in capturing candidates' po- litical positions. Preliminary election data was compiled, followed by the retrieval of historical textual website data through the Wayback Machine. This data was then pro- cessed, cleaned, and tokenized for further analysis. To quantify and compare political party positions, the study utilizes Wordfish (Slapin, Proksch 2008), an unsupervised scaling model that examines the relative frequency of terms across documents. My findings reveal that candi- dates' policy shifts are reflected in their official campaign materials. Furthermore, the study's results corroborate previous research by Stromer-Galley, Rossini, Hemsley, et al. (2021), and Wittenbrink (2022), demonstrating that candidates tend to moderate their ideological stances fol- lowing the primary election. By examining the dynamic nature of mayoral candidates' political ideologies, this study not only advances the literature on local elections but also highlights the potential of online communication channels to reveal strategic adjustments in candidates' policy positions throughout the election season. Reaction Behavioral Factor Michael Sun, Computer Science/Math; Mengzhe Yan, Economics and Mathematics Sponsor(s): Professor Ann Malavet, Computer Science Collegiate Research Scholar We proposed a multi-factor model based on in- vestor behaviors and assessed its capacity to explain the U.S. market stock returns. Our factor model was based on the behavioral factors which capture investors' reac- tions (overreaction and underreaction) to the equity price changes. We represented the factors with several quanti- tative anomalies adapted from Lian, Liu, and Shi (2021), who constructed a four-factor model in the Chinese mar - ket with the additional two size factors. Inspired by Dan- iel, Hirshleifer, and Sun's two-factor behavioral model (2020), We discarded the size factors and obtained better performance than the market in explaining the expected equity returns in the US. 61Transactional Desire: Exploring Male Student Sex Workers in China Chaoting Tang, Sociology Sponsor(s): Professor Siwei Cheng, Sociology Collegiate Research Scholar This paper presents a descriptive study of Chinese male student sex workers through a grounded theory anal- ysis of 25 semi-structured one-to-one online interviews. We found that the internet and introductions by peers were the two primary channels for Chinese male students to enter the sex industry. Most students were motivated to involve in commercial sex by a mixture of consumption and sexual desires. Student sex workers motivated mainly by sexual desire often select clients and consider commer - cial sex as \"transactional hookups.\" Student sex workers used strategies, including concealing, separating sex and love, simulating boyfriend experiences, and terminating romantic relationships, to deal with the stigmas they en- countered. Sexual health and STD prevention-oriented sexuality education in China had positive impacts on male student sex workers, but we have also found the necessity for more comprehensive sexuality education. As emerg- ing adults, college students are in a life stage distinct from adolescents and adults. We believe student sex work, as well as emerging adult sex work in general, needs to be differentiated from voluntary adult sex work in both scholarly research and public discussions of the legal sta- tus of sex work, especially in cases where students are not informed about the risks of engaging in commercial sex. Busing for Desegregation on Its Last Fumes Aidan Taylor, Journalism, Anthropology Sponsor(s): Professor Ted Conover, Journalism Joseph Jerome Research Scholar The St. Louis desegregation busing program is one of the oldest and largest in the country busing Black stu- dents in the city to predominantly white county schools and white schools in the county to magnet schools in the city. Spearheaded by a lawsuit against the St. Louis School Board from Minne Riddell and other families af- ter being displeased with the dilapidated and crowded St. Louis City Schools, the program began in 1983 and has bussed over 100,000 kids since, changing the education of many in its 40-year run. Still, busing programs are not meant to be permanent as per Supreme Court precedent and the program was never supposed to last forever. After being federally supervised, a 1999 settlement agreement caused the program to be run and managed by a non-prof- it organization called the V oluntary Interdistrict Choice Corporation. The number of students in the program has dwindled from its peak in the late 90s, and after being ex- tended a few times, next year will be the last year for new applicants. After reaching its set goal of integration in the late 90s, the schools have become almost as segregated as before the program was put in place. Many lives were changed through the program and students were given op- portunities they would never have received at their origi- nal schools, but it begs the question, what next steps is St. Louis going to take to fix their broken system? The Interaction between Misplaced Certainty Tendencies and Social Network Make-Up: Pilot Yashita Thota, Psychology Sponsor(s): Dr. Jiin Jung, Psychology Collegiate Research Scholar The current pilot study aims to pilot-test the survey materials and measures for a future larger-scale longitudi- nal social network study to disambiguate the causal link between misplaced certainty (i.e., being certain about the unknowable) and social network makeup. The first part of the pilot study (N = 504) examines whether the scale of misplaced certainty has a similar association pattern with antisocial tendencies and cognitive flexibility as it has been documented in the literature on paradoxical and dis- cordant knowing. The second part of the pilot study (N = 33) examines the name nomination method and diversity indices for social network surveys. We hypothesized that misplaced certainty is positively associated with antisocial tendencies and negatively with cognitive flexibility (H1). We also hypothesized that misplaced certainty predicts a smaller and more homogenous social network makeup (H2). Results revealed that consistent with H1, misplaced certainty was significantly positively associated with anti- social tendencies and negatively with cognitive flexibility. Consistent with H2, misplaced certainty predicted homog- enous social networks in abortion attitudes such that those who had the epistemic tendency of misplaced certainty tended to form social connections with others who have similar abortion attitudes to themselves; however, this as- sociation did not attain statistical significance. Additional- ly, well-placed uncertainty (i.e., being uncertain about the unknowable) significantly predicted homogenous gender and racial makeup in participants' social networks. Net- work size was not significantly associated with misplaced certainty or other epistemic structures. Damsels in Distress: Effects of Helping Behavior Perceptions on Women in the Workplace Josh Ting, Psychology Sponsor(s): Professor Madeline Heilman, Psychology Collegiate Research Scholar Across 3 studies, we've found that gender stereo- types differentially affect how men and women are per - ceived after they receive help, such that women are per - ceived as less competent, less agentic, and more helpless as compared to men when they receive help, especially when the help feeds into the gender stereotypes of women as needful and dependent (i.e., dependency-oriented help). 62We've also found that such dependency-oriented help is more disadvantageous to the perception of women when it comes from men, as compared to when it comes from other women, supporting our hypothesis that help from men may activate and exacerbate negative stereotypes of women in the workplace. These findings have important implications for organizational leaders and employees and could inform organizational policies intended to help women mitigate the negative effects of gender stereotypes on those domains. Proposer Uncertainty and Competition in Ultimatum Bargaining: an Experimental Study Renee Wang, Economics Sponsor(s): Professor Guillaume Frechette, Economics Dr. Evan and Brooke Kaye Research Scholar This study examines how uncertainty and risk in the total amount to be split and proposer competition affect offers and rejection rates in a modified ultimatum bargaining experiment. We find that introducing propos- er competition decreases offers and decreases rejection rates. When proposers in competition are given a known probability of the total, they try to take more for them- selves. The combination of competition and uncertainty leads to proposers asking for less and responders rejecting fewer offers than in other treatments. When there is no competition, responders reject at a higher rate. We find that proposer uncertainty only affects behavior when there is also proposer competition. Consumer Choices and Economics Trends Sirui Wang, Economics and Mathematics Sponsor(s): Dr. Baris Guven, Economics Starting with big picture economic trends, I can move on to how technology is changing people's lives, especially in this time of COVID-19, and helping people make the right decisions. In my previous business class, some believe that advances in automation will allow sub- stantial \"reshoring\" of manufacturing industries.Do you believe the world is deglobalizing \"I would like to contin- ue my in-depth research on this topic. Transfarmation Successes and the Ability of Transfarmation to Alter American Agriculture Tanwi Wangikar, Environmental Studies Sponsor(s): Professor Anne Rademacher, Environmental Studies Collegiate Research Scholar In America, the vast majority of poultry production is governed by a few major corporations that vertically in- tegrate all steps of broiler chicken production by contract- ing farmers to produce animals. Farmers in these contracts suffer economic hardship as well as health concerns, and the farms are tied to poor animal welfare and high envi-ronmental impacts as a result of intensive confinement. The Transfarmation project presents a novel approach to help farmers exit this system without incurring significant losses from farm infrastructure they have already invested in by retrofitting their facilities to accommodate plant or fungal cultivation. However, it is unclear to what extent this model could be applied to contract farms across the country, and the role that each transformation could play in overall animal and environmental welfare. An exam- ination of the factors that have allowed for a few suc- cessful Transfarmations could allow an evaluation of the potential for this approach to move farmers out of animal agriculture systems. New York City Mobility Index and the Relationship with Economic Activity Kyle Whitt, Economics and Mathematics Sponsor(s): Professor Anasse Bari, Computer Science The New York Community Trust Murray Hidary Research Scholar Alternative data sources, such as transit data and Google searches, can be used to quantify the physical movement of populations within a region. I hypothesize that an increase in mobility in New York City is correlat- ed with an increase in economic activity as measured by traditional economic data sources. By aggregating and analyzing data from multiple alternative data sources, an index that quantitatively demonstrates the amount of movement within New York City can be constructed. A model that tracks with established data published by the Federal Reserve can be created through this mobility in- dex and could lead to predicting trends in the city. These results could be valuable to city officials, policymakers, and businesses to inform decision-making and planning in that they take advantage of innovative data sources that have not previously been used in this context to provide better insight into mobility and the economy of New York City. Removing Equity Barriers to the Electric Vehicle Transition Brandon Wilky, Environmental Studies Sponsor(s): Professor Anne Rademacher, Environmental Studies The United States is currently undergoing an im- portant transition to electric vehicles that may be a ma- jor driver in lowering greenhouse-gas emissions over the next few decades. This shift in production and popularity of electric vehicles is demonstrated not only through the investments of various automakers, but also via the In- flation Reduction Act (IRA). A government initiative that promotes the purchase of electric vehicles by providing a tax credit towards their purchase. However, as electric vehicles become more popular, there will inevitably be a 63gap regarding the ease of this transition between wealthy and low-income Americans. This will be somewhat miti- gated by legislation and funding such as the IRA. Yet, the largest issue is not the capital required to purchase or rent an electric vehicle, but rather the capital and space needed to charge at home. One method that allows those unable to charge at home the opportunity to invest in electric ve- hicles, is to develop sites with large numbers of Level 3 charging stations in under-utilized parking lots in urban areas. These charging stations would be powered via an integrated system, composed of solar panels and battery storage to mitigate the impact on the electrical grid pro- duced by the charging stations. Law, Science Fiction, and Biomedical Technology: Utilizing Science Fiction to Engage the Public in Health and Biomedical Device Law Ambria Williams, Public Policy Sponsor(s): Professor David Oshinsky, History Collegiate Research Scholar This project seeks to understand how science fic- tion can be used as an educational tool for promoting public engagement in regulating biomedical technol- ogies such as medical robots. The goal is to understand how science fiction can lead to better public engagement, multidisciplinary analysis, and representative multi-stake- holder collaboration when addressing complex problems related to bioethics, technology, and policy. Given the advancement of surgical and healthcare assistive robots, for example, these technologies need to be regulated to ensure safety, effectiveness, and access. As a result, indi- viduals in the science and technology industry have been utilizing unique methodologies called design fiction and science fiction prototyping. This project describes the his- tory of science fiction, design fiction, and science fiction prototyping studies to analyze how the genre can help lay communities understand complex health and science pol- icy topics. The robot Baymax from the sci-fi film \"Big Hero Six\" is utilized as a case study to understand the eth- ical and policy issues associated with personal healthcare robots. By revealing the ethics of technology, inspiring scientists and the public, and reflecting real-world themes, science fiction can act as a bridge between the public and science. How Trauma-Informed Tattooing Fractured an Industry Entrenched in Tradition Abby Wilson, Journalism, English and American Literature Sponsor(s): Professor Ted Conover, Journalism Collegiate Research Scholar The American tattoo experience is moving away from the kind of transactional exchange that one typically associated with modern tattooing - a quick, stenciled de-sign, a gesture to the ATM in the corner and a swift push out the door. Pili Ojos Magnificos, an artist at the center of an innovative Baltimore circle, is leading the way in including the client in the process, from before the tat- too is designed to days after it is completed, often estab- lishing long-term relationships along the way. A growing group of artists have also come to terms with an often unacknowledged emotional burden taken on by tattoo artists, and are equipping themselves with the tools they need to protect themselves, along with their clients. As a result, the level of care they offer goes far beyond an ink-to-skin exchange. Clients seek this new level of care, many having sought the service in the traditional space first before turning to the alternative. But within an in- dustry that's steeped with history - from prohibitions to pin-up girls, over hundreds of years - many traditionally trained artists long for the heritage that, to some extent, is being left behind by new generations of tattooers. Others are grappling with the reality that new shops attract a new clientele, diversifying an already burgeoning industry into something they have trouble recognizing. Some of these artists question whether new artists teaching themselves how to tattoo might compromise a staunch connection to tattooing's cultural background. Patient Perspectives on Access to and Quality of Healthcare after a Traumatic Brain Injury Karen Wong, Global Public Health/Anthropology Sponsor(s): Olga Garduno-Ortega, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Rusk Rehabilitation Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a complex and chronic condition caused by a bump, blow or jolt to the head. This mixed-method study aims to document how individuals with TBI navigate life from injury to present and investigates the barriers and facilitators associated with understanding and managing the condition. Partici- pants (N=53) were recruited through community outreach events and referrals throughout New York City from 03/2019 - 03/2021. Central themes emerged across two categories: (1) barriers to healthcare access and (2) facil- itators to healthcare access. Barriers to healthcare access included gaps in care and limited availability of specialty services, causing a loss of trust and confidence in the pa- tient's medical provider. Facilitators to healthcare access included clear communication between the clinician and the patient and external tools patients and their caregivers used to promote health management. Healthcare commu- nication was identified as a critical facilitator and a barrier to care. Additional efforts to improve access and quality of healthcare services for individuals with TBI and their caregivers will require an integrated healthcare systems approach. Improving TBI education and awareness efforts would allow medical providers and caregivers to become 64more familiar with and aware of the symptoms and daily challenges that individuals with TBI experience. Procedural Justice, Compliance, and Judicial Decisions Con Xie, Finance Sponsor(s): Professor Karen Miner, Sociology; Professor Lynne Haney, Sociology Though judges, both state and federal, are regulat- ed by judicial oversight committees, judicial opinions still vary greatly in language used, logical means used to justi- fy the decision, and transparency. These seemingly insig- nificant differences, however, contribute to public percep- tion of justice, and to whether the court's operations were procedurally just. As there is very little literature on the precise impact of procedural justice as observed through the practice of writing judicial opinions, this literature re- view extrapolates from more generalized research on the impact of procedural justice in the justice system at large on public perception and compliance. Observations also derive from the researcher's experiences working on the Department of Justice's National Community Court Ini- tiative for the Center for Justice Innovation as an NYU Law & Society Fellow. This study seeks to inspire further research into how dedicating efforts into ensuring proce- durally fair judicial opinions could bolster compliance and citizens' relationship with the justice system, and how it could lead to fairer, more equitable outcomes. The Role of School Assistance on FAFSA Completion: Who Benefits the Most? Yutong (Celia) Xie, Economics, Psychology Sponsor(s): Professor Timothy Roeper, Economics The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the first and most important step for prospec- tive students to access financial aid, yet the completion rate remains relatively low. To remedy this low takeup is- sue, high schools and government agencies have offered multiple financial aid-related information and services to students and families. This paper attempts to shed light on the effect of school-level assistance on financial aid-eligi- ble students' decision to complete the FAFSA. Specifical- ly, I examine four distinct types of application assistance in high schools and compare their effectiveness across socioeconomic groups using the High School Longitudi- nal Study: 2009-2013 (HSLS:09). This study utilizes OLS regression and finds that both information sessions and one-on-one advisory yield positive effects on the FAFSA completion rate for all aid-eligible high school students. However, after dividing students into three socioeconom- ic cohorts, Across three regressions for the low, medium, and high socioeconomic cohorts, the one-on-one advisory is the only predictor remaining to be statistically signifi-cant in improving the likelihood of participants' applica- tions for financial aid. A Deep Dive into Deep Tech Startups Koko Xu, Mathematics Sponsor(s): Glennon Simmons, NYU College of Dentistry Richard Robins Entrepreneurial Research Scholar Deep tech startups are companies that develop technologies based on scientific and engineering research, with a focus on solving complex and challenging prob- lems. In contrast to regular startups, which often focus on developing software or mobile applications, deep tech startups work on breakthrough innovations in areas such as AI, biotechnology, robotics, and nanotechnology. These startups play a critical role in driving innovation, creating new industries, and solving some of society's most pressing challenges. Deep tech innovations have the potential to revolutionize entire sectors, from healthcare and energy to transportation and manufacturing, and can help address issues such as climate change, food security, and healthcare access. However, deep tech startups often face unique challenges, such as longer development time- lines, higher capital requirements, and complex regulato- ry environments. These challenges can make it difficult for these startups to secure the necessary funding to scale and grow. Therefore, funding deep tech startups is crucial for fostering innovation and creating a sustainable future. By supporting these startups, investors and governments can help accelerate the development and adoption of breakthrough technologies, create high-quality jobs, and drive economic growth. Additionally, funding deep tech startups can help address some of society's most pressing challenges and improve quality of life for people around the world. In conclusion, deep tech startups are essential for driving innovation, creating new industries, and solv- ing some of the world's most pressing challenges. By rec- ognizing the importance of these startups and providing them with the necessary support, we can create a brighter and more sustainable future for all. An Analysis of Stock Forums and Their Accuracy Sunny Yang, Economics, Data Science; Wiley Wu, Economics, Data Science; Rachel Xing, Computer Science Sponsor(s): Professor Andrea Jones-Rooy, Data Science Since early 2020, there has been a massive increase in the number of retail investors, or individual/amateur investors, accounting for twenty-five percent of total op- tions trading activity. This upward trend in new retail in- vestors has persisted into 2022, and retail investors are using social media more than ever to communicate with other retail investors about their stock moves via Red- dit and other forums. Our research project explores the question: how similar and accurate are the research posts 65in popular stock-posting forums, such as r/Stocks and r/ Wallstreetbets? We explored how media like the posts on these forums impact the equity market. These stock-post- ing forums varied wildly in tone and format, which made comparing predictions from more formal subreddits such as r/Stocks with less formal ones like r/WallStreetBets very interesting. Further analysis was conducted on the relationship between author and accuracy, author's use of language(ex: jargon) and accuracy, and then basic features including word count with accuracy. Finally, we com- pared the models we created with more advanced mod- els using deep learning or neural nets to see how much performance can be gained by making the switch. We believe our research could help the finance world better understand the importance of retail investors, compared to traditional hedge funds or asset management firms, espe- cially when considering future development of algorithms specifically for the finance sector. The comparison of per - formances between simple and complex models may be a useful indicator in determining the necessity of more complex models. Quest for Intimacy: A Case Study of Christian Emerging Adults' Religious Individualism in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic Tianle Ye, Sociology Sponsor(s): Professor Michael Hout, Sociology Collegiate Research Scholar The previous literature on the religiosity of religious believers during the COVID-19 pandemic overlooks the details of believers' everyday lives, and few studies focus on the religious practices and experiences of Generation Z, who were born around the year 2000. Based on 21 in- depth interviews with emerging adults aged 18 to 25 who identify themselves as Christians in New York, this study examines their concerns, anxieties, and various responses to the challenges posed by the pandemic. This research demonstrates that both young religious individualists and collectivists seek intimacy in their religious lives; howev- er, their interpretations and the importance of intimacy in their religious lives differ. In addition, this research shows that the pandemic broke down their intimacy, but as the pandemic gradually receded, they both restored intima- cy that played a key role in the restoration of faith. The research enriches the understanding of the faith of Gener - ation Z and religious individualism in the United States. Seeing Yourself: How Identity and Experience Inform Number Interpretations of They Mayee Yeh, Applied Psychology, Linguistics Sponsor(s): Professor Laurel MacKenzie, Linguistics Collegiate Research Scholar Representative of modern language change, us- ages of they have strayed away from its historically pre- scribed plurality, and gained rising prominence in singular contexts, especially as a personal pronoun. Considering that the singular, specific, gendered they is likely most prominent in transgender and/or nonbinary (TNB) social spaces, there may be significant variations in the number interpretation of they, according to personal identity and experience. This research paper replicates Arnold et al. 2021 to analyze the influence of personal experience and 66ideology on interpretations of they. Following implicit ex- posure to characters' personal pronouns (e.g. Alex wrote down notes. They are attentive in class.), participants read similar sentence pairs (e.g. Alex went to the store with Will. They purchased some apples.) and answered questions (i.e. Who purchased some apples?) about the sentence pairs. Their responses indicated if they was in- terpreted as a singular pronoun (i.e. only Alex) or a plural pronoun (i.e. Alex and Will). Overall, male participants who used he/him pronouns were significantly less like- ly to have singular interpretations of they. More notably, when Alex was placed in the subject position, participants who identified as neither male or female and/or did not (exclusively) use he/him or she/her pronouns, were sig- nificantly more likely to have singular interpretations of they in comparison to other participants. Understanding Chinese Bond Market: An Empirical Study from the Perspective of Buy-Side Credit Ratings Relevance Chenye Yuan, Economics and Mathematics Sponsor(s): Professor Diego Perez, Economics; Professor Viplav Saini, Economics Over the past few years, the Chinese bond mar - ket has experienced significant growth and reformation and has become one of the world's largest bond markets. However, the unique market structure of the Chinese bond market, where the government plays a crucial role in regulation and credit rating, and buy-side credit rating agencies (CRAs) as the fruit of it, has been paid little at- tention by Western academia. This study aims to examine the informativeness of Chinese buy-side CRAs and the influence of government support on credit ratings and the bond market. Using a sample of bond issuers from 2015 to 2021, the study first tests the hypothesis: whether buy- side credit ratings are informative and reflect company fundamentals and default risks. The study also examines whether government support has a significant influence on bond ratings. The data is collected from an integrated database provided by WIND, including publicly available company reports, credit rating reports from CRAs, and market data. This study will provide a more comprehen- sive understanding of the role of buy-side CRAs in the Chinese bond market and the impact of government inter - vention on the market. The Real Effects of Banking Competition on Manufacturing Industries: Evidence from the United States National Banking Era (1863-1912) Jerry Zhang, Economics and Mathematics Sponsor(s): Professor Martin Rotemberg, Economics Jurate Kazickas Research Scholar I quantify the real effects of banking competition on manufacturing industries by utilizing capital require-ments during the National Banking Era (1863-1912). City population-based capital requirements served as a barrier to bank entry and influenced the provision of bank credit (Carlson et al., 2022). Using a sample of matched man- ufacturing industry-city population data from 1860 and 1880, I find that reduced bank entry and lower credit pro- vision, induced by high barriers or low banking competi- tion in cities with over 6,000 inhabitants, restrain the real outcome growth for manufacturing industries in these cit- ies by approximately 30% compared to the manufacturing industries located in cities with populations slightly below 6,000. This is demonstrated by a discontinuous drop at the 6,000 population cutoff using the Regression Discontinui- ty design. Furthermore, I discover that manufacturing sec- tors heavily reliant on external financing from banks are most sensitive to the real effect. This paper provides mi- cro-level evidence to support the causal relationship be- tween financial development and real economic growth. Role of Prefrontal Cortex Activity in Behavioral Deficits Caused by Maternal Separation Zelin Zhao, Psychology Sponsor(s): Dr. Catia Teixeira, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Child and Adolescent Psychology; Dr. Edenia Menezes, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Child and Adolescent Psychology; Dr. Fabiula Abreu, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Child and Adolescent Psychology Collegiate Research Scholar The postnatal period is one of high synaptic plas- ticity when the emerging brain can be shaped by the envi- ronment in adaptive or maladaptive ways. Dysfunctional caregiving leads to maladaptive behaviors associated with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysfunction. Previously, the laboratory observed that low frequency neural activity in the PFC is greater when the mother is present in the nest than when she is absent. Last summer, we would like to test whether exciting the PFC during maternal separation (MS) can rescue cognitive deficits caused by maternal separation. The laboratory uses viral vectors to express designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) to manipulate PFC activity during early life. These designer receptors are activated by the drug CNO. To excite cell activity, the laboratory uses HM3D in combination with CNO. Controls include virus without DREADDs (mCherry) and the injection of vehicle (SAL). Pups are infused with the virus in the PFC at postnatal day P1. Then, they are injected with CNO or vehicles from P2 to P17. Behavioral tests are performed during adulthood (>P60). We tested for two cognitive functions: working memory using the delayed non match to sample test (DN- MTS), and cognitive flexibility using reversal learning in the operant conditioning. We found that exciting the PFC during MS rescued cognitive deficits in working memo-67ry. However, the reversal learning in operant conditioning was not affected by MS. Our results highlight that activity of PFC in early life affects behaviors in adulthood. The Economic Effects of Subway Parallelism: A Comparison Study of Common Track Subways of New York City and Shanghai City Abby Zhou, Economics Sponsor(s): Professor Xiaohan Zhou, Chongqing University Collegiate Research Scholar This is a comparison study between the common track subway line A and D of New York MTA(Metropoli- tan Transportation Authority) and line 3 and 4 of Shanghai Metro. By using the multi-factor regression model as the main methodology of statistical analysis, the relationships between the parallelism of the subway system and the land usage of surrounding areas are revealed and com- pared. More specifically, the similarities and differences in the planning, construction, history, and practical usage of lands along the common path are examined and ana- lyzed. According to Xiying Sun and Jun Ju's essay \"The Effect of Shanghai Subway Construction to the Economic Growth of the Surrounding Area,\" after the construction of the subway, Shanghai's population, industrial output, and housing prices of the area around the metro stations have increased significantly. However, in the essay of Da- vid King, \"Developing Densely: Estimating the Effect of Subway Growth on New York City Land Uses\"(2011), the subway construction of New York did not lead but followed the residential and commercial growth of the surrounding areas. Then, by examining the different pro- portions of land usage and traffic density of each station, the data shows significant discrepancies in urban design. These results echo with the socio-cultural background of these two cities. Together with a brief comparison analy- sis between two designs of common track and individual track, the conclusion evolves to several proposals of pro- moting the commercial function wielding in an effective modern subway complex. How Does Media Exposure to Body Positivity Influence Adolescent Women's Self-Image? Zhijun Zhou, Psychology Sponsor(s): Professor Denis Pelli, Psychology Due to technological and social progress, the con- ventional definition of beauty has been questioned and redefined. On social media, individuals promote self-love and body acceptance regardless of size and shape, which has led to the emergence of the \"body positivity\" move- ment. This study aims to examine how exposure to media affects the perception and satisfaction of adolescent girls with their bodies. The study initially collected the opin- ions of participants regarding their self-esteem and body satisfaction. The participants were then randomly as- signed to view one of three videos with varying degrees of relevance in body positivity. After exposure to the media, participants re-assessed their self-esteem and self-image. The study revealed that exposure to body-positive media resulted in an increase in body satisfaction and self-es- teem ratings among the participants. This finding suggests that promoting positive and inclusive media messages, as well as implementing more inclusive beauty standards in education, may have a short-term positive impact on the self-images and self-esteem of young women. 6- to 20-Month-Olds' Visual Preferences for Own- Race or Other-Race Faces as Influenced by Social Environment Diversity Lisa Zhu, Psychology Sponsor(s): Sophie Arnold, Psychology; Professor Marjorie Rhodes, Psychology Collegiate Research Scholar Little past literature has used the preferential looking paradigm to examine how much and what kind of social environmental diversi- ty infants need to attenuate their perceptual bias at same- race or other-race faces. The present research addressed the research question \"Does social environmental diver - sity affect 6- to 18-month-olds' visual attention to same- race versus other-race faces?\" 135 6- to 18-month-old infants with diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds were shown online 12 women and men face pairs consisting of all possible combinations of Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White faces. Only pairs with a same-race face and an other-race face for a particular infant were taken for anal- ysis. We quantified two measures of diversity (i.e., social network diversity and neighborhood diversity) with the Child Social Network Questionnaire and ZIP code infor - mation provided by their parents after infants completed their looking paradigm experiment. Results showed that infants from both diverse and less diverse environments looked equivalently long at same- and other-race faces, regardless of age. Surprisingly, we found that infants with more diversity in their environments looked longer at fac- es, regardless of whether the face was a same-race face or an other-race face. These findings were true for both social network and neighborhood diversity. These results imply that minimal exposure to neighborhood racial di- versity may be sufficient to attenuate infants' visual bias at same- or other-race faces.68 Role of SCRN1 in Phosphorylation in Alzheimer's Disease Lisa Abe, Dr. Dominique Leitner, Neurology Collegiate Research Scholar Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex disease unique to humans, typically characterized by two hall- mark proteins, amyloid beta (AB) and tau proteins. Am- yloid betas and abnormally phosphorylated taus will accumulate in the brain and form plaque deposits and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) respectively. These collect intra and inter neuronally and disrupt cell function. Cur - rent clinical trial failures at 99.6% necessitates AD ther - apeutic approaches to better reflect the genetic diversity of disordered pathways driving AD pathology. Recent experiments have displayed AB aggregates forming in as- ymptomatic AD, and downstream tau accumulation later drives neurotoxicity. Thus, current paradigms have begun to focus on tau as it remains AB may be essential, but not sufficient, to cause AD (Bal et al., 2021). Using unbiased proteomics approaches, secernin-1 (SCRN1) is one of the most abundant novel proteins found colocalizing with pTau neurofibrillary tangles. Past SCRN1 studies have shown SCRN1 as an early neurodegeneration marker in tau transgenic mice suggesting SCRN1 may play an im- portant role in AD pathogenesis (Drummond et al., 2019). Immunohistochemistry showed consistent high degree of colocalization of phosphorylated tau and particularly high levels of SCRN1 in plaque-associated dystrophic neurites and NFTs. Thus, this provides a promising drug target beyond AB and tau. Overall, we will investigate histological characterizations of brain anatomy, specifi-cally hippocampal anatomy to see if SCRN1-KOs affect this. We anticipate generating this data will help us better understand whether SCRN1 truly plays an important role in AD pathogenesis that could provide a new therapeutic target for patients in the future. Decoding the Role of HIF-1 in Staphylococcus aureus Skin Infection Elizabeth Abraham, Biology, Art History Sponsor(s): Professor Shruti Naik, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Pathology; Ipsita Subudhi, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Pathology Collegiate Research Scholar Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a highly virulent pathogen and a leading cause of skin and soft tissue infections globally. If left untreated, MRSA infections can lead to systemic disease and mor - tality. Because MRSA is resistant to beta-lactam antibi- otics, current frontline therapies include systemic admin- istration of more potent antibiotics, such as vancomycin. However, reliance on antibiotics as mainstay therapies may lead to selection for increasingly antimicrobial-resis- tant pathogens. An alternative therapeutic approach may be to augment the host's local immune response against MRSA infection in the skin. During infection, Type 17 immune responses play an important role in mediating both inflammation and epithelial responses. Our lab has identified epithelia-specific activation of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) downstream of IL-17 to promote wound repair. We hypothesized that pharmacological activation of this transcription factor in a MRSA-infected skin lesion would augment tissue heal- ing. Using a mouse model of MRSA skin infection, we STEM70topically applied FG-4592, a HIF1-activator, to infected lesions. Remarkably, following treatment, we observed enhanced MRSA clearance and wound closure. We also find that FG-4592 has no direct antimicrobial activity, in- dicating that this pharmacological agent may be boosting the host's defense response. Ultimately, understanding how boosting HIF-1 activity in infected lesions aug- ments immune and non-immune host responses may lead to targeted therapies and may serve as a promising alter - native treatment for highly pathogenic, antibiotic-resis- tant infections. Applying Predictive Analytics to Alternative Data from Tik Tok to Make Socially Responsible Investments Tomisin Adeyemi, Computer Science Sponsor(s): Professor Anasse Bari, Computer Science Collegiate Research Scholar Socially responsible investing (SRI) is an invest- ment approach that seeks to generate financial returns while also promoting social and environmental goals. In recent years, there has been growing interest in using al- ternative data sources to inform SRI decisions, including data from social media platforms such as TikTok. This research project explores the potential of TikTok as an alternative data source for SRI by developing a recom- mendation engine that uses TikTok user data to suggest socially responsible investment opportunities to users based on their interests and preferences. To achieve this, we will collect data on TikTok users' engagement with SRI content, then conduct deep learning and clustering analyses to identify patterns in user behavior and atti- tudes towards SRI. We will also scrape ESG (Environ- mentalSocial, and Governance) and other relevant data on companies to categorize them based on various criteria. We will use TikTok user data to provide valuable insights into users' preferences and values, which can be used to develop personalized investment recommendations. The recommendation engine will be deployed as a web app that will allow users receive investment recommendations based on their interests and preference. Beyond Ballot Boxes: How Decentralized Voting Systems Could Revolutionize Nigeria's Political Landscape T\u00f3s\u00ecn Akinnagbe, Computer Science The implementation of blockchain technology in various industries, including voting systems, has garnered significant attention in recent years. Blockchain provides a decentralized and tamper-proof way of recording trans- actions, which can improve the transparency, security, and efficiency of voting systems. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications can enhance these benefits with features such as fraud detection, voter verification, and data analysis. Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa and a democracy, has a history of electoral fraud and irregularities. The integration of a decentralized vot- ing system that utilizes blockchain technology and AI applications could address some of the challenges associ- ated with traditional voting systems such as vote manip- ulation and voter fraud. Therefore, this research project aims to explore the feasibility of such an implementation in Nigeria. The project will begin with a literature review on voting systems, blockchain technology, and AI appli- cations in the electoral process. The research will then use a mixed-method approach that includes a survey of vot- ers, interviews with key stakeholders, and a case study of a similar decentralized voting system. The results of this study could have significant implications for the fu- ture of electoral processes in Nigeria and other countries. By improving the transparency, security, and efficiency of the electoral process, a decentralized voting system that incorporates blockchain technology and AI applications could help restore public trust in the electoral system. Ad- ditionally, this implementation could serve as a model for other countries seeking to improve their electoral process- es. Real Estate Price Predictions using Alternative Data Sources Ali Alshehhi, Computer Science Sponsor(s): Professor Anasse Bari, Computer Science; Sneha Singh, Computer Science Collegiate Research Scholar Given the implementation of data algorithms to change the way we live today, many use data to better make inferences on just about anything. Being in New York City, the financial hub of the world, many seek to invest in it; one form of investing in New York is real es- tate, but how can one tap into such a major market? Per - haps we could follow the method of looking at tradition- al features in real estate, but what if there was another form of predicting valuation fluctuations in the market? What if there was a better measure of determining market growth? Here is where alternative data sources come in, which have to do with non-conventional data that could be attributed to an effect. In our instance, we are looking for non-traditional features that might not associate with having an effect on the real estate market. This research study will examine and determine the effect of Citibike data, DOB Complaints, Legally Operating Businesses, Evictions, and restaurant health inspections data as al- ternative data sources that could have an effect on real estate market prices. We aim to collect relevant data from governmental entities/websites/responsible parties in or - der to process the data, link it with the real estate market, and find revealing insights. Such insights will be found by looking at time-series analyses and finding changes in the 71market over time with the associations from alternative data. This research product aims to help smaller invest- ment firms and brokers with finding emerging markets in New York City via backed data. Such information is updated in real-time, beating the market lag that many brokers and small investment firms have to go through. Offering this could truly change how these smaller firms invest in New York City. NOESY Analysis of Choline-Chloride Based Deep Eutectic Solvents Sarah Anderson, Chemistry Sponsor(s): Professor Alexej Jerschow, Chemistry The initial goal of this research was to reproduce the results of a previous NMR study of choline-chlo- ride based solvents by Delso et al. Deep eutectic sol- vents (DES), that is solvents with melting points lower than those of the individual components, have emerged as useful for many reasons. Low toxicity and minimal energy use in synthesis provide just a few justifications for the use of DESs in the laboratory in contrast to tra- ditional volatile organic compounds (VOCs). DESs may be used as food additives for preservation and flavoring and RNA/DNA storage and extraction. Each solvent here consisted of choline-chloride (hydrogen bond acceptor), a hydrogen-bond donor (urea, ethylene glycol, or glyc- erol), and water in a molar ratio of approximately 1:2:1. NMR experiments were performed on neat eutectics and those diluted in 10% D2O to determine relaxation times, self-diffusion coefficients, and to find evidence support- ing the existence of a hydrogen-bonding network, as pre- dicted by the aforementioned study. Experimental data was relatively consistent with the expected results, with a few exceptions; overall, supporting the existence of a 'supramolecular structure of the DESs. Previous studies around DESs have presented mostly a qualitative analysis of the interactions that occur, evidenced by merely the ex- istence of cross peaks and the nuclear Overhauser effect. This work has focused largely on a quantitative analysis of the proximity of protons in the solvents. Through the analysis of these cross peak intensities with varied mixing times in nuclear Overhauser effect Spectroscopy, one may understand the distances between protons in this structure, and the extent to which this structure is retained or lost with water content. Mitigating the Impact of Scientific Inquiry on Plastic Pollution: Reapproaching Methods for Sampling Aquatic Macroinvertebrates Rafael Baez, Biology Sponsor(s): Professor Katie Schneider-Paolantonio, Biology This project aims to address environmental plastic pollution during the analysis of freshwater macroinverte-brates using novel biodegradable mesh to replace plastic leaf packs employed during ecological surveys. The pres- ence of macro/microplastics in the Bronx River represents a threat to the organisms within the river system. A recent pilot study from NYC Baykeeper and NJCU suggests the presence of twice as many microplastic particles as plankton at the mouth of the Bronx River. Traditionally, a plastic mesh pack is filled with leaf litter and left sub- merged for a time before being retrieved. Studies looking at amphibian and macroinvertebrate diversity, genetics, leaf degradation rates and bacterial colonization often utilize leaf packs within investigations, highlighting the widespread and versatile use of this technique. Due to factors such as inclement weather, debris accumulation, human error and symptoms of \"urban stream syndrome\", packs are lost. Usually, this occurrence is offset by placing more plastic packs in the water. However, pack loss con- tributes to the large-scale pollution within the river. To ad- dress this, we tested six biodegradable alternative packs at three locations along the Bronx River between Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 at a site visited by New York Universi- ty's (NYU) Ecological Field Methods (EFM) course. We assessed these materials based on: durability, portability, longevity, affordability and effectiveness at collecting in- vertebrate data compared to the plastic. Results presented several viable alternatives to the plastic standard, indicat- ing a need for the scientific community to re-approach its methods for the analysis of ecosystemic health using leaf mesh packs. Temporal Localization Studies Uncover Novel Putative Protein Targets of the Protease PrkA during Spore Formation in Bacillus subtilis Ethan Bakal, Global Public Health, Biology Sponsor(s): Professor Patrick Eichenberger, Biology Max Bronner Research Scholar When under environmental stress, spore-forming bacteria including Bacillus subtilis undergo sporulation to protect genetic material. Protein Kinase A (PrkA) is a spore coat protease key to sporulation in \"B. subtilis,\" but its exact role is poorly understood. To contextualize PrkA in the spore formation pathway, we identified the morphogenetic proteins responsible for its localization. We visualized PrkA-GFP using fluorescence microscopy in the knockout backgrounds of several key spore coat proteins (SCPs). Our results suggest that PrkA is regulat- ed by SpoIV A, CotE, and potentially SafA, indicating that PrkA might have substrates in both the inner and outer spore coats. To further narrow down the list of candidate substrates, we conducted dual-labeling fluorescence mi- croscopy on strains expressing PrkA and CFP-labeled kinetic class I and II SCPs. We found that PrkA-YFP localizes slightly later than the class II protein CotE-CFP. To confirm the localization of PrkA to the spore 72coat, we repeated the dual localization experiment in the \u00ee\"spoIV A\" deletion mutant background. We found that PrkA-YFP colocalized to the detached spore coat with other SCPs only half of the time, suggesting that PrkA likely has another target at the forespore that is unrelated to the spore coat. These results bring us a step closer to understanding the niche of PrkA in the sporulation path- way and help focus the direction of future research into the protease's potential substrate(s). A better understand- ing of this pathway will be critical to the development of novel antibiotic treatments targeting spore-forming patho- gens such as Clostridioides difficile. Unraveling the Genetic Network of the Crust Layer Pertaining to the Bacillus subtilis Endospore with CotW's Localization as the Main Target Ahmed Behiry, Biology Sponsor(s): Professor Patrick Eichenberger, Biology Bacillus subtilis is a bacterial species that is eas- ily transformable and capable of growth in numerous environments, thus making it a highly studied model or - ganism. One of the main mechanisms that distinguish B. subtilis from many other bacteria is its ability to form en- dospores upon starvation in a process called sporulation. A fully mature spore is the most durable biological organ- ism currently known due to its dormant state allowing it to endure harsh environmental conditions. The outermost layer of the spore, the crust, is a glycoprotein layer made up of of fluorescence microscopy experiments, we were able to identify the subcellular lo- calization of the crust protein CotW-GFP in response to the deletion of the crust proteins: CotX, CotY , CotZ, and CgeA. We also investigated deletion of CotO, a coat pro- tein previously determined to promote encasement of the spore by the crust. Our results illustrated that CotW-GFP localization is impaired in a cotXYZ triple mutant as well as in individual cotX, cotY, and cotZ mutants. By contrast, deletion of cgeA has no effect on CotW-GFP localization. Additionally, we observed that in a cotO mutant, CotW- GFP does not complete encasement of the spore. Thus, we concluded that the CotW-GFP protein requires the cotX, cotY, and cotZ genes for localization and the cotO gene for spore encasement. CotW-GFP does not require the cgeA gene for localization.The Role of Fibroadipogenic Progenitors in Homeostatic Maintenance, Regeneration, and Atypical Tissue Formation in Skeletal Muscle Bardan Bhatta, Biology Sponsor(s): Professor Michael Wosczyna, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Orthopedic Surgery Collegiate Research Scholar Fibroadipogenic progenitors or FAPs are mesen- chymal stem cells found in the interstitial space between muscle fibers. These cells have the ability to differentiate into adipocytes, fibroblasts, or osteocytes and are char - acterized by their expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRa). In order to specifically target FAPs, we created a PDGFRa knock-in mouse mod- el. Using this model, we found that FAP-depleted mice exhibit delayed regenerative ability after injury to their skeletal muscle. Under homeostatic conditions, these mice also experience muscle atrophy and a loss of muscle stem cells (MuSC). These findings establish the necessity of FAPs for long-term maintenance, normal growth, and effective regeneration of skeletal muscle. Despite the im- portance of FAPs, many questions remain, such as what are the exact mechanisms through which they influence musculoskeletal tissue. While it is known that FAPs play a role in the regulation of MuSC function, which in turn aid the development of myofibers, the specific interactions between FAPs and MuSCs are unestablished. Addition- ally, it is known that FAP proliferation and differentiation potential changes in pathological and physiological con- ditions. Dysregulation of FAP activity results in fibrosis, fatty infiltration, and muscular dystrophy. The consequent replacement of skeletal muscle with fibrous and fatty tissue is a hallmark of these conditions, resulting in the weakening of muscle. How these changes in FAP function affect the musculoskeletal niche have not been thoroughly investigated. Our work aims to answer these questions, illustrating the role that FAPs play in homeostatic mainte- nance, regeneration, and atypical tissue formation within skeletal muscle. Diffusion and Capture of YpjB from the Mother Cell to the Outer Forespore Membrane is Necessary for Efficient Sporulation of Bacillus subtilis Adam Bruzzese, Biology, Chemistry Sponsor(s): Professor Patrick Eichenberger, Biology Peter Bergmann Research Scholar, Peggy and Bernard Sakin Research Scholar Sporulation is the process by which bacteria retreat into resistant dormancy in the absence of nutrients. YpjB is a poorly characterized membrane protein expressed during Bacillus subtilis sporulation into heat resistant, dormant cells called endospores. After commitment to sporulation, a two-chamber cell forms, composed of a larger mother cell and a smaller forespore. In the subse-73quent engulfment stage, the mother cell wholly engulfs the forespore. Previous work has implicated YpjB in this engulfment stage, but the mechanism by which it localizes from the mother cell (origin of expression and production) to the outer forespore membrane and allows for spore re- sistance is unknown. In this study, we sought to under - stand this mechanism of YpjB by examining its structure, function, and localization during spore formation. Primar - ily, we found that YpjB is necessary for efficient sporu- lation of heat-resistant spores by conducting several heat resistance assays. We observed a significant sporulation defect in the YpjB deletion mutant and an even greater defect in the YpjB-GFP fusion, which interestingly dis- plays a dominant negative effect. The YpjB deletion mu- tant and Ypjb-GFP fusion were also shown to decrease sigG activation in a beta-galactosidase assay. Secondly, through sporulation by resuspension and visualization by fluorescence microscopy, we found that YpjB-GFP localization may occur through a diffusion and capture mechanism that depends on membrane proteins, SpoIIQ, SpoIIIAH, SpoIVFA, SpoIVFB, and on the transcription factor, SpoIIID. Since B. subtilis is a model organism, our studies can translate to spore-forming pathogens because the sporulation process and its associated proteins are highly conserved. ERK Phosphorylation Patterning Provides Evolutionarily Conserved Gain Control to Long-term Facilitation Dynamics in Mammalian Cells Robert Carney, Neural Science Sponsor(s): Professor Nikolay Kukushkin, Global Liberal Studies Within the field of long-term memory research, much attention and precious time has been devoted to the study of individual enzymes in the formation of the mo- lecular substrate of memory-long-term facilitation (LTF). The study of these key enzymes in isolation has yield- ed important insights into the process by which synapses are strengthened and weakened. However, the individual study of these proteins in isolation has led to an inability to synthesize the wealth of biochemical information into a coherent temporal framework that can be understood and manipulated. Specifically, many critical oddities in mo- lecular dynamics within the context of LTF have been dis- covered in the dynamics of neuromodulators such as 5HT, protein kinases such as PKA, and most importantly ERK. ERK, a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), must be dually activated to phosphorylate its downstream tar - gets, and previous research has demonstrated ERK phos- phorylation dynamics are highly variable yet predictive of training success. However, the field has yet to incor - porate this quirk in ERK dynamics into the wider context of its upstream enzymatic partners such as PKA and its downstream targets. Therefore, it is necessary to create and validate a method of experimental manipulations to facilitate the synthesis of biochemical temporal dynamics into a well-understood and simple time course. Here we show that high throughput mammalian cell culture spaced repetition techniques not only reproduce previously ob- served temporal dynamics found in the 5HT-PKA-ERK pathway while also elucidating previously unknown tem- poral importances of gain control led by diverse dephos- phorylation patterns. Exercise and Anxiety: Using Threat Response to Reveal the Effects of Exercise on the Nucleus Accumbens Natalia Castillo, Neural Hubley, Neural Science Collegiate Research Scholar Exercise, demonstrated to have anxiolytic proper - ties, has been linked to improvements in mood. Symp- toms of anxiety disorders can be modeled in rodents through the use of Signaled Active Avoidance (SigAA). This paradigm consists of training rodents to associate a sound with a threat, and learning to avoid it. Rodents are placed in a two chambered box, played an auditory tone and electrically shocked. If the rodent learns to shuttle to the opposite chamber upon hearing the tone, it will escape the shock with proactive threat avoidance. In our rodent model, one group was housed with access to a running wheel for exercise, while the control group was not. All rodents went through SigAA training and testing, and their shuttling behavior was recorded. On the 9th day, the foot shock was removed to assess their behavior without the threat. Afterwards, the rodents were perfused and their brains preserved. The area analyzed was the central amyg- dala, which is essential to the brain's avoidance pathway. C-Fos, an immediate early gene, was used to determine the difference in activity between the nucleus accumbens shell and core. Males performed significantly worse than females in overall shuttling. Overall, the group without access to the running wheel was better at shuttling than the experimental group. There was no significant differ - ence in cell count between groups. Results suggest that access to a running wheel does not improve the ability to avoid threats. Sub-Cellular Localization of Zinc Transporter Proteins ICT1 and ICT2 Justyn Chang, Biochemistry Sponsor(s): Dr. Serap Erdogmus, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Pathology Collegiate Research Scholar Zinc serves a crucial role in immune function as it is necessary for various key functions such as enzy- matic activity, gene transcription, and various signaling 74pathways in CD4+ T cells. The zinc ICT protein fami- ly in question acts to restore cytosolic zinc levels within cells, with various of its family members located in dif- ferent subcellular locations such as the Golgi apparatus or plasma membrane. In particular, ICT1 has been theorized to be localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it regulates zinc transportation from the ER or Golgi into the cytosol. Similarly, ICT2 has been speculated to regulate cytosolic zinc levels; however, pri- or studies determining its exact subcellular localization are sparse. By retrovirally expressing these proteins and staining for ICT1 and ICT2 antibodies, the location of these proteins can be determined through colocalization with organelle tracker dyes on a confocal microscope. In this way, the roles of these proteins in zinc regulation of CD4+ T cells can be determined and their greater impor - tance in immune function can be further studied. Visualizing Excitatory Synapses over Interneurons Erez Geron, Neural Science Collegiate Research Scholar In the brain, there are a series of neurons that either excite or inhibit the neighboring neuron. Synapses are the spaces between neurons and in this project, we are investi- gating how synaptic activity is organized within inhibitory neurons (interneurons). Specifically we will be looking at excitatory neurons activating interneurons and how inter - neurons receive these signals. This topic has been thus far challenging to investigate since excitatory synapses over dendrites of inhibitory neurons have relatively less puncta compared to pyramidal neurons. We hypothesized that ex- citatory synapses over dendrites in inhibitory neurons are rich with filamentous actin. For this project, we designed a GCaMP probe that is preferentially distributed to fila- mentous actin and by that we can image synaptic activity in inhibitory neurons. This is a sub-field in neurobiology that is completely unexplored. As a proof of principle, we will focus on layer one inhibitory neuron which the Rudy lab has characterized recently (Schuman 2019). Investigation of Speech Production Pathways through Representation Similarity Analysis (RSA) of Stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) Data James Chen, Neural Science Sponsor(s): Professor Xing Tian, Neural Science The transformation of representation between lex- icon and phonetic levels in speech production pathways has long been questioned. Here, we apply a novel analysis method - Representation Similarity Analysis (RSA). RSA is applied to Stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) data of responses to 50 different Chinese characters, within which each pair of characters will have the same pronun-ciation. We clearly identified the feasibility of applying the RSA method in investigating speech production path- ways of sEEG data. Effect of Single-Residue Mutations on CTCF Binding to DNA: Insights from Molecular Dynamics Simulations Carrie Chen, Biochemistry Sponsors: Professor Tamar Schlick In humans and other eukaryotes, DNA is con- densed into chromatin fibers that are further wound into chromosomes. This organization allows regulatory el- ements in the genome, often distant from each other in the linear DNA, to interact and facilitate gene expression through regions known as topologically associating do- mains (TADs). CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is one of the major components of TAD formation and is respon- sible for recruiting a partner protein, cohesin, to perform loop extrusion and facilitate proper gene expression with- in TADs. Because single-residue CTCF mutations have been linked to the development of a variety of cancers in humans, we aim to better understand how these mu- tations affect the CTCF structure and its interaction with DNA. To this end, we compare all-atom molecular dy- namics simulations of a wildtype CTCF-DNA complex to those of eight different cancer-linked CTCF mutant sequences. We find that most mutants have lower bind- ing energies compared to the wildtype protein, leading to the formation of less stable complexes. Depending on the type and position of the mutation, this loss of stabili- ty can be attributed to major changes in the electrostatic potential, loss of hydrogen bonds between the CTCF and DNA, and/or destabilization of specific zinc fingers. In- terestingly, certain mutations in specific fingers can affect the interaction with the DNA of other fingers, explaining why mere single mutations can impair CTCF function. Overall, these results shed mechanistic insights into ex- perimental observations and further underscore CTCF's importance in the regulation of chromatin architecture and gene expression. Using Predictive Analytics to Understand How Genes Interact in Alzheimer's Disease Steve Ciervo, Neural Science, Psychology Sponsor(s): Professor Anasse Bari, Computer Science Collegiate Research Scholar Over the past century, biologists and neurobiolo- gists alike have been searching for the mechanisms that lead to the three major forms of Dementia: Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and Lewy Body Dementia (LBD). Tauopathies, or pathologies as a result of abnormal tau protein configurations, have been the overarching subject of memory debilitation and long- term memory decline associated with AD and Dementia. 75Recent theories suggest a more complicated model of AD and Dementia, stemming from the overactivation of ce- rebral fructose metabolism that mitigates mitochondrial energy production (Johnson, Richard et al., 2023). Other theories suggest that AD may be an autoimmune disorder, rather than being derived from the central nervous system (Weaver, 2021). This paper seeks to unify these three ma- jor theories and their subsets in accordance with Dementia detection, development, and presence by using predictive analytics to fundamentally understand how genes interact in memory-associated pathways. Software such as Bench- ling and Ensembl will be used to analyze the genomic se- quences of specific genes. Using computational and statis- tical methods with R Studio and manual computation, this paper uses chemical kinetics, predictive enzyme-substrate specificity, and the frequency factor identification of the Arrhenius Equation in order to derive predicted outcomes on the specific memory pathway associated with that spe- cific gene. Through genetic modifications by simulating Multi-Nucle- otide (STRs), permuta- tions of the gene will be induced in order to get differen- tial results of gene-gene interactions. Estimating the Number of Computational Units within Teagan Daly, Biology Sponsor(s): Dr. Erez Geron, Neuroscience Collegiate Research Scholar Neurons contain three main compartments: their cell body (soma), dendrites, and axon. The neuron's cell body and dendrites can integrate inputs to yield output fir - ing. These semi-independent somatic-dendritic activities can enhance the overall neuronal computational power. Yet, much support exists that distinct functional sub- groups within the dendritic tree further increase neuronal computational power. However, there is no agreement on the extent of such functional dendritic subgroups, with opinions that vary by several orders of magnitude. This project aims to relate variability in dendritic activity to the structure of the dendritic tuft, therefore, allowing us to es- timate the number of computational units within dendritic arbors. These results are significant because estimation is critical for understanding and determining the computa- tional power of neurons, networks, and the brain. We la- beled single cortical neurons with a structural marker and a calcium probe (td-tomato and GCaMP, respectively). Single-cell labeling allowed us to monitor multiple den- drites from neurons with well-defined structures. Dendrit- ic activity in labeled neurons was then monitored using two-photon microscopy in awake-behaving animals over extended periods. Data-driven analysis of calcium activity estimates the number of functional units operating within apical dendrites of neurons. In a precursor test, we used this method on a small number of spikes, we identified a highly variable dendrite activity pattern indicating several units. Ongoing experiments use these methods and anal- ysis on a much larger data set to Chemistry Collegiate Research Scholar Colloids are small, spherical particles that have a number of physical and chemical properties that are tun- able. One such property is its responsiveness to solvents. Colloids, especially those with polystyrene patches, are able to swell and deswell in the presence of organic sol- vents. The aim of this project is to synthesize a linked chain of these colloidal particles with responsivity. Do- ing so yields a stimulus responsive chain on the colloidal scale. The applications of such a system are immense, ranging from biomedical applications to catalysis. Visualizing Energetics and Dynamics of Microsporidian Infection Ari Davydov, Biology Sponsor(s): Professor Gira Bhabha, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Cell Biology; Professor Damian Ekiert, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Cell Biology and Microbiology Salant Family Research Scholar in Pre-Health Studies Microsporidia are intracellular parasites that infect a wide range of hosts, using a unique, harpoon-like inva- sion organelle called the polar tube (PT). To infect their host, microsporidia transport infectious material (sporo- plasm) through the PT. Infectious sporoplasm is transport- ed into the host cytoplasm, allowing microsporidia to ini- tiate replication. The mechanism of polar tube entry into the host cell is unknown. There are two main hypotheses for the invasion mechanism: 1) The PT pierces the host cell membrane to create a direct path to the cell interi- or, and 2) The extruded PT and/or infectious sporoplasm enters the host cell via endocytosis. The goal of this proj- ect is to capture microsporidia invasion into the host-cell using high-speed light microscopy. The main challenges of this objective will be to maximize PT firing efficiency, spore-host cell adherence, and germination conditions. Optimizing a system of visualizing PT entry into the host cell will allow us to study parasite-host interactions through high-speed fluorescence live-cell microscopy and to manipulate PT firing kinetics in the context of the host cell.76Encoding Expertise in a Dynamic Decision Tree Ethan Delgado, Computer Science Sponsor(s): Professor Dennis Shasha, Computer Science Collegiate Research Scholar The dynamic decision tree was originally creat- ed to help clinicians diagnose Multiple Myeloma cancer in hospital patients. The dynamic decision tree has now expanded its focus. The project aims to make it easy for non-technical people to navigate rule oriented informa- tion. Examples include laws and regulations, repair man- uals, and other applications. Users can also create their own dynamic decision tree. Users can use the dynamic decision tree application to plan strategies and navigate tough rule-based decisions. Today's presentation will display an example of a dynamic decision tree focused on social security eligibility, the input format for such an application, and experimental results with users. The proj- ect's experiment was done using Amazon's Mechanical Turk to show the effectiveness of such an interface over currently available technology. This project was done in collaboration with Professor Dennis Shasha. My research focus was cultivated in my time with Professor Anasse Bari during my time in the Sophomore Scholars Seminar at NYU. Review and Analysis of Choice of Topology in Particle Swarm Optimization Anthony Dender, Mathematics Sponsor(s): Professor Anasse Bari, Computer Science Collegiate Research Scholar I will be doing a comprehensive review and anal- ysis of choice of topology with respect to the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) optimization algorithm. The PSO algorithm was originally developed in the late 1990s as a representation of the movement of a school of fish or a flock of birds, and it was later discovered that the algorithm is quite good at optimizing functions in a wide variety of situations. Unlike more traditional optimization algorithms, PSO does not utilize the gradient vector of the function being optimized, which means that such a func- tion need not be differentiable and can take many different forms. The basis of a lot of machine learning algorithms is minimizing a specific cost function, and PSO is often implemented as the algorithm to minimize such a func- tion, so PSO performance has ramifications for the speed and precision of many kinds of artificial intelligence. My work will be a comprehensive and up-to-date analysis of the effect of choice of topology on PSO solution quality and convergence. I will implement both commonly tested topologies, such as the gbest, lbest, star, and ring topol- ogies, as well as more novel topologies, such as a tour - nament-style topology and various adaptive topologies. I will use the usual set of test functions, as they provide an accurate measure of the performance of the optimization algorithm in common use. The set of topologies that I will be testing will be compiled based on an extensive review of the existing literature, and it is also possible that I may modify some of the existing topologies myself if I find reason to do so. The topologies will be evaluated using the typical performance measures commonly used in studies of PSO optimization analysis. 77Neuron-specific Distribution of Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 Receptor in Brain Erendzhenova, that insulin-like growth fac- tor 2 (IGF2) is required for memory formation. Learning increases IGF2 levels, and by injecting recombinant IGF2 peptide results in enhanced memory (Chen et al, 2011). Administration of either mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) or IGF2 into hippocampi promotes memory enhancement, which suggests that the receptor, not ligands, is critical for memory formation and enhancement (Yu et al, 2020). Thus, the effects of IGF2 on memory occur via its specific receptor, IGF2 receptor (IGF2R). The distribution of IG- F2R in the brain and within the hippocampus is essential to understand underlying mechanisms that lead to mem- ory formation. IGF2R expression under the basal con- ditions was abundant in cell soma and less abundant in the processes. Thus, our study showed a general decrease in IGF2R expression with training in CA1 subregion of hippocampi, implying that IGF2R can possibly influence memory consolidation through the degradation process. However, interaction between IGF2R and other subtypes of neurons that have important implications in memory remains unknown. Genome-Wide Mapping of Transcription-Replication Conflicts using Oxidative Markers Samuel Ezeonu, Global Public Health, Biology Sponsor(s): Professor Duncan Smith, Biology; Dr. Lisa Dailey, Biology An ongoing project in the Smith lab seeks to use proximity-biotinylation through the use of APEX perox- idase. APEX is a proximity-labeling system that is able to generate free radicals that reach nearby proteins and DNA in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. We reasoned that APEX-tagged DNA-bound proteins could allow for localized oxidation of the DNA, which could be detected by the 8-oxo-7,8 hydroxyguanine (8-oxoG) marker. We tested to see whether strains carrying APEX-tagged DNA binding proteins displayed hydrogen peroxide sensitivity and led to increased 8-oxoG in the DNA and assessed if there was a significant difference caused by the absence of OGG1--the DNA glycosylase that initiates base excision repair of 8-oxo sites. Our findings indicate that MCM4- APEX ogg1 has more sensitivity to peroxide. However, the following dot blot assay was unable to provide evi- dence to support oxidation of the DNA by APEX, due to a lack of increase in 8-oxoG relatively between APEX and wild-type control. Additional testing is needed to affirm APEX as a useful oxidative tool for mapping, but it is a novel approach that comes with great promise in mapping molecular activity.Search for a New Receptor of Human PD-L1 and PD-L2 Iris Fagniez, Biology Sponsor(s): Dr. Jean-Laurent Casanova, Rockefeller University, Human Genetics Collegiate Research Scholar The interactions and functional roles of human PD-L1 and PD-L2, when studied in isolation from PD- 1, remain poorly understood. Upon characterizing a PD-1 deficient patient (Ogishi et al., 2021), we found evidence suggesting that human PD-L1 and PD-L2 may bind to an- other putative immunoreceptor to downregulate T-cell ac- tivation and proliferation. This project highlights the \"tar - geted\" approach to finding the putative receptor of PD-L1 and PD-L2 through the comprehensive characterization of six candidate genes. A CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knock- out system was used to knock out each candidate recep- tor in HuT78 cells, originating from a human CD4 T cell line expressing no detectable levels of PD-1. Subsequent stimulation assays and ELISA were performed to quantify IFN-y production, which is used as an experimental read- out for T-cell activation. High-throughput screening strat- egies are also explored as alternative approaches to find- ing the putative receptor due to challenges with obtaining high knocking-out efficacies in the six candidate genes. Uncovering the Projection of Dopamine Receptors within the Posterior Dorsal Striatum Catherine Fan, Psychology Sponsor(s): Dr. M\u00e9lanie Druart, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Neuroscience and Physiology Collegiate Research Scholar I am investigating the processing of auditory in- formation in the Auditory Striatum (AudStr). The AudStr is part of the Dorsal Striatum (DS), which is a significant component of the brain that integrates inputs that convey sensory information, reward-value, and other commands from the cortex and thalamus. More importantly, the DS is necessary for the formation of sensorimotor associa- tions during reinforcement learning due to its integration of dopaminergic inputs, along with other cortical and subcortical inputs. Most studies on these inputs focus on projections to medial spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing D1 or D2 dopamine receptors (direct and indirect pathway spiny projection neurons, respectively), as they constitute approximately 95% of striatal neurons. Recently, work on the AudStr has revealed that it is able to help with pro- cessing of emotion and motor capabilities. Utilizing viral vectors, my project will allow us to identify the pathways involved in sensorimotor processing in the striatum, par - ticularly as it relates to auditory input areas such as the au- ditory cortex and thalamus. I will use anatomical tracing techniques to resolve the connectivity of the D1 and D2 input pathways within the AudStr, and focus on the cor -78tical and thalamic input by using innovative techniques to analyze images with a semi-automatic counting of cell bodies and axonal projections. Ethnic Distribution of Molecularly Classified Brain Tumors Camila Fang, Biology Sponsor(s): Dr. Matija Snuderl, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Pathology; Ivy Tran, Pathology Collegiate Research Scholar There are over 100 types of molecularly defined primary brain tumors with little known about their eth- nic distribution. We analyzed a cohort of 1,709 primary brain tumors in regards to ethnicity through self-report- ed data in medical records. We categorized ethnicity into three groups: Asian, Black, and White, and classified brain tumors using clinically validated whole genome DNA methylation analysis into ten major molecular class- es and over 40 subclasses (Louis, Wesseling et al., 2021 and Capper, Jones et al., 2018). While 82% of our cohort was White, 10% Black, and 8% Asian, Blacks represented 16% resented in pituitary (p=5.68E-07), as were Asians at while Whites were un- derrepresented at 47% (p=1.12E-08). Whites comprised the majority of IDH mutant gliomas at 89% (p=0.0195), while Blacks were 3% (p=0.00334). Whites represented in meningiomas, at 77% (p=0.0413). Glio- blastomas showed a large proportion of Whites, at 90% (p=0.000836), and a small percentage of Blacks, at 3% (p=0.000252). Two molecular glioblastoma subclasses showed overrepresentation mid- 24% (p=0.00969) and RTK a nonuniform distri- bution of molecular subtypes of brain tumors in different ethnicities, suggesting underlying predisposition to spe- cific brain tumor classes and subclasses. A Review of Sentiment Analysis Applications in Finance Matthew Foster Walsh, Computer Science Sponsor(s): Professor Anasse Bari, Computer Science Collegiate Research Scholar Sentiment analysis is an increasingly popular tool in financial markets to estimate overall market sentiment, evaluate risk, and predict price movements of individual stocks and index funds. A variety of studies have shown that online sentiment is correlated with stock returns, and can even be used to predict prices or inform trading mod- els. Certain studies have also indicated that social media sentiment, such as from twitter or stocktwits, can provide useful information alongside more traditional financial news outlets. Several distinct methods have been pro- posed and utilized to evaluate sentiment and compare it to concrete financial data, which has indicated a predictable tradeoff between very high performance and accuracy, although medium and high latency methods frequently produce comparable results to each other. Challenges in this area of research include a domain-specific vocabu- lary which renders most traditional sentiment models un- suitable for this purpose, and a lack of labeled data for supervised learning. Despite these drawbacks, sentiment analysis has been widely used by highly resourced institu- tional investors, and recently certain financial news sites have begun providing sentiment data for specific secu- rities, allowing retail investors to leverage this powerful technology as well. Desynchronization of Entorhinal-Hippocampal Theta in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease Pathology Angie Galas, Neural Science Sponsor(s): Lauren Vetere, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Neuroscience Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by the onset of memory impairments. It has been established that the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocam- pus (HPC) are critical regions for memory. Thus, exam- ining the communication between the two regions could be pertinent to understanding cognitive decline in AD. One method of detecting communication between brain regions is by examining neural oscillations. Theta, a fre- quency attributed to behavioral activation and memory, could be analyzed to represent communication. In this study, we examined theta coherence between the MEC and HPC in a mouse model of AD pathology at an age where spatial memory impairments are first beginning to emerge. Neurons associated with synchrony mainte- nance, parvalbumin (PV) interneurons, were quantified. We hypothesized that there is a reduction of theta coher - ence across MEC and HPC in the transgenic mouse model compared to WT controls. To test this, we performed dual silicon probe recordings while mice ran on a virtual re- ality linear track. We found a desynchronization of theta between MEC and HPC in our mouse model of AD pa- thology compared to WT. We also expected to observe a reduction of MEC PV interneurons in the mouse model of AD pathology. We found a decrease of PV interneurons in the MEC, but no change in HPC in our transgenic mouse model when compared to WT. Here we demonstrate that disrupted communication between MEC and HPC, poten- tially linked to the reduction of PV , could be a mechanism underlying cognitive decline in AD.79Open-Loop Reward Retrieval: Mining Reward Functions from Joint Latent Spaces Carla Garcia Medina, Computer Science, Data Science Sponsor(s): Professor Rob Fergus, Computer Science; Ulyana Piterbarg, Computer Science; Anthony Chen, Computer Science Sylvia Engel Friedman Research Scholar Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms enable agents to learn behavior policies purely through environ- mental interaction; however, the success of these algo- rithms and the quality of the learned policies they produce hinges on the existence of accurate reward functions for tasks of interest. Reward functions associate state-action pairs with scalar rewards and, to be well-defined, they must have the property that the total reward over a sin- gle episode of interaction is maximized exactly when the agent executes the target behavior. These functions can be hard to specify, especially for real-world applications. In particular, analytically deriving accurate and well-de- fined reward functions is intractable for dynamic settings such as household environments, where the objects that embodied agents may come in contact with cannot be predicted a priori, and state information is only available via noisy estimates from computer vision methods. This presents a major obstacle to the real-world applicability of RL. Humans, however, tend to specify goals through natural language and, we thus, hypothesize that a solution to this problem may be found by leveraging web-image and web-text vision-language models. These models are trained to associate images with semantic queries via In- ternet-scale corpora of visual and textual data, establish- ing an association between states (i.e. images and/or im- age embeddings) and natural language. Given a desired real-world task with a semantic description, e.g. \"stack the mug on top of the dish,\" we investigate whether it is possi- ble to employ VLM's highly articulated embedding spac- es to derive a generalized mapping between real-world observation-action pairs and scalar rewards that precisely satisfies the criteria of a well-defined reward function. In this project, we aim to investigate this problem by lever - aging VLMs to induce reward functions that facilitate ef- ficient online RL. The Effect of Obesity on VMHvl-CCKAR Cells and Its Ability to Modulate Mating Behaviors Aishwarya Gollamudi, Biology Sponsor(s): Dr. Luping Yin, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Neuroscience Robert Selander Research Scholar Obesity has become a global issue that has been increasing in magnitude. In the year of 2017, it was found that approximately 42% of the population of adult females in the United States are obese (CDC, 2017). Obesity has been proven to cause morbidities as well as increased mortality (Abdelaal, 2017). In particular, obesity has been proven to adversely impact an individual's reproductive health, regulation of menstrual cycles along with the suc- cess of assisted reproductive technology (ART). There- fore, there appears to be a relationship between metabolic and reproductive processes. However, the neural mecha- nism behind the effects of obesity on reproductive deficits has yet to be fully elucidated. Previously, it has been found that a population of cells that express Cholecystokinin A Receptor (CCKAR) in the ventrolateral of the ventrome- dial hypothalamus (VMHvl), VMHvl-CCKAR neurons, are necessary for female mating behavior (Yin, 2022). It is possible that these neurons modulate the relationship between reproductive and metabolic processes. So, the investigation of the neuronal activity of VMHvl-CCKAR neurons using fiber photometry could potentially reveal the mechanism of how obesity negatively affects repro- ductive processes. The theory is that obesity causes a decrease in the activity of the VMHvl-CCKAR neurons and therefore causes the subsequent decline in reproduc- tive health. Therefore, it is possible that VMHvl-CCKAR neurons are the link between metabolic and reproductive processes. Perhaps, with a target to aim for, there is the possibility of creating therapies for reproductive issues in the future. Ketamine's Positive Effects on a Mouse Model of Anorexia Extend into Adulthood with Repeated Dosing Seb Goodwin-Groen, Neural Science Sponsor(s): Professor Chiye Aoki, Neural Science Sylvia Engel Friedman Research Scholar Winner of Phi Beta Kappa Albert Borgman Prize for Best Honors Thesis in STEM Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a chronic psychiatric condition without accepted pharmacotherapy that emerg- es in adolescence, with very high mortality and low re- covery rates. The best animal model for AN is called activity-based anorexia (ABA), which involves a com- bination of food restriction and voluntary running wheel activity. This leads some adolescent mice to rapidly lose dangerous amounts of weight. Ketamine is emerging as a promising new AN therapy; previous work showed that one dose of ketamine delivered in mid-adolescence helps mice become resilient to ABA weight loss, both acutely (within one ABA exposure) and chronically (in a 2nd ABA exposure 14 days later). However, when ketamine was delivered for the first time in late adolescence (2nd ABA), it exacerbated weight loss in a 3rd ABA. We hy- pothesized that this loss of effect in late adolescence could be due to decreased neuroplasticity in older mice, so we administered three doses of ketamine in the 2nd ABA. This dosing was sufficient to restore ketamine's ameliora- tive effects: acutely, animals were better able to suppress 80running during food availability, and chronically, ani- mals compensated better for excessive exercise by eating more, yielding better body weight retention. These bene- ficial effects of ketamine were not seen in male mice, or in females at low ketamine concentrations. These results support the notion that multiple sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine may be a helpful pharmacotherapy for females diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, but caution that one needs to be mindful of potential age- and sex-differences in the action of ketamine. Understanding the Function of the Medial Amygdala Foxp2 Subpopulation for Female Social Behaviors Jordan Layla Gross, Psychology Sponsor(s): Dr. Julieta Lischinsky, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Neuroscience Collegiate Research Scholar Innate social behaviors are critical for animal sur - vival, and the amygdala plays a central role in innate aggressive behaviors. The medial amygdala (MeA) sub- division displays specific, topographically organized, and sexually dimorphic responses to pheromone che- mosensory cues required for innate behaviors and social communication in mice. The MeA is functionally rel- evant for mating and aggression; however, the function of transcriptionally defined subpopulations has not been extensively studied in female mice. The MeA consists of a major GABAergic cell subpopulation marked by the Foxp2 transcription factor. Past research investigating MeAFoxp2 cells in innate social behavior indicated that the subpopulation bi-directionally modulates male territo- rial aggression, but this research has not been performed in females. Our research aims to identify the functional role of MeAFoxp2 cells in the production of innate so- cial behaviors in female mice. Chemogenetic activation of MeAFoxp2+ cells in female mice during distinct es- trous states will allow us to determine if the subpopula- tion is sufficient for mating and aggression. We expect that aggressive behaviors in response to various sensory cues require MeAFoxp2+ cell activation and differ based on the female estrus cycle. Our preliminary results reveal a decrease in female investigation of male conspecifics during MeAFoxp2+ cell activation. In addition, we will examine potential sex differences in the number and dis- tribution of MeAFoxp2+ cells. A better understanding of neuronal diversity and function in the MeA provides the first steps in developing therapies for disorders with core social deficits, such as autism spectrum disorder, which affects approximately one percent of children globally.Investigating the Neural Mechanisms Defining the Temporal Structure of Consciousness Anvita Guda, Language and Mind Sponsor(s): Dr. Giulia Gennari, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Neuroscience James A. Shea Research Scholar While there has been great advancement in the understanding of conscious processing, the underlying neural mechanisms that trigger conscious access have not yet been disambiguated. To address this gap in our knowledge, it is crucial to observe the temporal structure of conscious processing as it relates to abilities to process sensory information. When exactly this sort of perceptual awareness arises has been a difficult question to answer. Initial evidence of conscious perception unfolding serially was refuted by observations that subsequent events can de- termine the perception of preceding stimuli, contradicting the classical notions that \"causes precede consequences.\" In light of these findings, the recent \"two-stage model\" proposes that information is first unconsciously and con- tinuously processed over a period of time, and then ren- dered into discrete conscious percepts. To probe the \"two- stage model\", we postulated the following questions: (a) what are the neural correlates of the two-stage process, and (b) what mechanisms regulate the closure of the con- tinuous, unconscious processing window and the subse- quent transition into bringing information into conscious awareness? To explore these inquiries, we utilized a visual illusion, motion-induced blindness (MIB), in which a sub- ject's perceptual awareness of a salient target is altered by a rotating mask. The target disappearances can tell us about closures of the unconscious processing window. We intended to test whether it is possible to use pupil diameter to identify the time points at which the target is present to when it is absent, and vice versa. Through our preliminary results with a singular participant, we suggested that pupil diameter is not a reliable index of perceptual switches due to inconsistent latencies of pupil constrictions and dila- tions when cross-analyzed with stimuli responses. This data suggests that further, more customized, exploration is necessary to map these perceptual switches. Uncovering the Role of Post Replicative Repair and Cyclin/CDK Control in Regulating RNase H2 Activity to Maintain Genomic Integrity in S. cerevisiae Mehnaz Halima, Biology Sponsor(s): Professor Duncan Smith, Biology Collegiate Research Scholar A major cause of genomic instability is the mis- incorporation of ribonucleotides into DNA during rep- lication. Left unrepaired, ribonucleotides in DNA are associated with replication stress, gross chromosomal re- arrangements, and overall genomic instability. These ribo- nucleotide lesions are repaired via the Ribonucleotide Ex-81cision Repair (RER) pathway, where the ribonucleotide is incised by the key enzyme RNase H2. RNase H2 is also involved in the resolution of RNA/DNA hybrid R-loops. Prior work in S. cerevisiae supports primary RNase H2 activity occurs in the G2 phase of the cell cycle; artifi- cial restriction of RNase H2 to the S phase leads to sin- gle and double-strand breaks and consequent replication stress. Mechanisms controlling this cell cycle regulation of RNase H2 however are still unknown. We identified two pertinent mechanisms in the regulation of RNase H2 activity: 1) Post-Replicative Repair pathway, involving Rad6/Rad18 mediated ubiquitination of PCNA, promotes RNase H2 activity and 2) Cyclin/CDK control represses RNase H2 activity in the S phase and promotes its activity in the G2 phase. Using genetic interactions in yeast and biochemical analyses to assay ribonucleotide burden, we found evidence supporting each of these pathways. These results performed in yeast have implications for the RNase H2 mechanism in humans. Specifically, defects in RER may contribute to the development of cancer, neurological disorders, immunodeficiency disorders, autoinflammato- ry disorders, and aging. Thus, uncovering the regulation of RNase H2 and RER is essential to understanding their role in these various disease models.Investigating Molecular Mechanisms Conferring Anti PD-1/PDL-1 Blockade Resistance Anika Hashem, Biochemistry Sponsor(s): Professor Michelle Krogsgaard, Medicine, Perlmutter Cancer Center; Dr. Yury Patskovsky, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Perlmutter Cancer Center; Samantha Nyovanie, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Perlmutter Cancer Center The endurance of tumor growth can be sustained by the ability of cancer cells to manipulate the immune system such that they escape immune detection and elim- ination. Since the depletion of immunologic control is an emerging hallmark of cancer, strategies that improve the strength and sensitivity of immune responses against ma- lignancies have tremendous potential. Cancer immuno- therapy designed to target immune checkpoint receptors, which exert inhibitory control over T-cell signaling, and their respective ligands have yielded positive outcomes in melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (Han, 2020). Targets of such treat- ments include Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD-1), which assumes an imperative part in inhibiting immune responses and fostering immune self-tolerance, and its major ligand Programmed Cell Death Ligand (PDL-1) (Han, 2020). Though anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy is promis- ing, clinical response has been limited; since PD-1/PDL-1 blockade can revitalize fatigued cytotoxic T-cells, path- ways that incite chronic T-cell exhaustion can contribute to PD-1/PDL-1 blockade resistance (Wolf, 2019). Lym- phocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3), an inhibitory check- 82point receptor that suppresses T cell activation in synergy with PD-1, and its functional ligand fibrinogen-like pro- tein 1 (FGL1) hold considerable potential as targets for cancer immunotherapy (Qian, 2021). A Recommendation System to Overcome Filter Bubbles and Intellectual Isolation Selin Hekimgil, Computer Science Sponsor(s): Professor Anasse Bari, Computer Science Collegiate Research Scholar Music streaming services have become a sta- ple due to the ease of access to any music at any time. Among them, Spotify has taken the lead by collecting large amounts of data and training models to fit each us- er's profile. Recommendations play a crucial role in this age, as they provide personalized advice to the user from a machine. To be effective, recommendations must match an individual's preferences and avoid repetitive sugges- tions of similar items to keep the user engaged. Hence, diversity in recommendations is essential to prevent user boredom. Improving the user experience has always been a priority for music streaming companies, but the goal now is to take it one step further by enhancing the person as a whole. Our research project aimed to develop a novel song recommendation algorithm that leverages a user's musical preferences and listening history to generate di- verse and personalized recommendations. The data anal- ysis relies on the Spotify Application Programming Inter - face (API) as well as Spotify's publicized Million Playlist Dataset (MPD), where patterns were identified between different music genres, artists and songs. This work can be applied to other domains beyond music, such as movie or book recommendations, and may have broader implica- tions for personalized marketing and consumer behavior research. 3-D Holographic Optical Trapping Claire Hornburg, Physics, Mathematics Sponsor(s): Professor David Grier, Physics Nathan and Sarah Chesin & Bernard and Mollie Steuer Research Scholarship in the Life Sciences, Arthur L. Wolf Research Scholar, Myron Kove Research Scholar Optical traps are tightly focused beams of laser light that allow one to manipulate microscopic particles. The intensity gradient from the sharply focused light cre- ates a force that pulls particles into the trap. In addition to 'points' of light, one can also use holography to create traps that instead have more complicated trajectories in space, such as a ring or a line, and the manipulation of phase gradients can give a trapped particle angular mo- mentum, which causes it to move along the shape of the trap. The broad goal for this project is to explore how to create holographic optical traps with a complex, 3-Di- mensional structure, and that are equipped with angular momentum. More specifically, I hope to create a trap in the shape of a trefoil knot, such that a trapped object will move tangentially along the knot. To this end, I first con- structed the optical trapping machine, and then created a method for digital aberration correction, and an optimi- zation algorithm. The aberration correction and optimi- zation will allow us to make very tightly focused traps, which will give us the necessary precision to create a trap that has a complicated 3-Dimensional shape. Targeted Degradation of Recombinant BCR-Abl using Photoswitchable Chimeras Daniel Hu, Chemistry Sponsor(s): Professor Dirk Trauner, University of Pennsylvania, Chemistry Targeted degradation is an important tool in study- ing proteins and in certain disease treatments. In chron- ic myeloid leukemia (CML), the recombinant protein BCR-Abl is a protein of interest given its role in resisting apoptosis2. One mechanism for specific and controlled degradation of BCR-Abl is through a Photochemically Targeting Chimera (PHOTAC) to cause ubiquitination of BCR-Abl, leading to its degradation. A cell viability assay was utilized to determine which PHOTAC variation had the best light-activated activity. Subsequently, using the previously determined linker length, K562 cells were again treated with varying PHOTAC concentrations in light versus dark conditions before being lysed and per - forming a western blot to visualize successful degrada- tion of BCR-Abl. While there was a significant drop in cell viability for the 3 carbon linker-length PHOTAC, the western blot showed no degradation of BCR-Abl in the 390 nm versus dark conditions, leading us to conclude that the cell viability was reduced by inhibition-not degra- dation-and to re-think our PHOTAC design. Characterization of SERCA's Role in B Cell Function Kurt Hu, Biochemistry Sponsor(s): Professor Stefan Feske, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Pathology Collegiate Research Scholar B lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, play a crucial role in adaptive immunity. The main functions of B cells include antigen presentation, antibody production, and cytokine secretion. Upon infection, mature B cells are activated in either T cell-dependent or independent path- ways where they can undergo class-switch recombination and differentiate into plasma cells (PCs), which produce antibodies. Dysregulation of B cell function underlies a variety of disease states including cancer, autoimmunity, organ transplantation, and HIV . A functional class of inte- gral membrane proteins known as ion channels and trans- porters (ICT) regulate the cellular flux of ions and me-83tabolites, which are critical for many molecular pathways and homeostatic conditions within all cells. In the context of B cells, the functions of many ICTs are still unknown. However, given their crucial role in general cell functions, ICTs represent a promising class of proteins for pharma- cological intervention. To address this gap in knowledge, the Feske lab at NYU Grossman School of Medicine has performs expression screens based on RNA-sequenc- ing datasets as well as forward genetics screens based on CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palin- dromic repeats) technology with a focus on B cells. From these screens, the lab has identified several ICT candidate genes which, upon deletion, result in various phenotyp- ic aberrations in primary murine B cells. My work has been focused on characterizing an ER calcium transporter named Atp2a2. Factors of Women's Wellness in the U.S. Caroline Huber, Mathematics, Economics Sponsor(s): Professor Anasse Bari, Computer Science Collegiate Research Scholar Women's place in society has long been a source of debate from first wave voting rights to fourth wave in- tersectionality issues. The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive women's wellness measure and use it to analyze potential root causes of women's issues in the United States. This measure will be a statistic calculated using various factors of women's wellbeing and weighing them according to how impactful they are. I will weigh it on the percentage of the female population that it af- fects. For example, the percentage of women who live in counties with an abortion provider affects women who could get pregnant, while the wage gap or women's share of STEM workers affects women in the labor force. Cur - rently, the statistic considers 23 factors like: Gender Wage Gap, Women's Share of STEM Workers, Share of Women in Professional Jobs. It will be a living measure on a web- site that is updated when new data is published. A crowd- sourced element may be involved where people can leave information about a statistic or thoughts on women's wellness in their region. After this measure is created, it is compared to other statistics (which may not typically be associated with women's issues) to assess potential root causes for such issues. For example, one could compare this measure to statistics about education, such as SAT score, political leaning, such as percentage of democrat- ic leaning inhabitants, and drug abuse. Currently, I have 21 such comparing factors. Results from this could reveal unrecognized links between political interests. So, people addressing these causes could come at it together. In short, the more we know about women, the more we can help them in society.Bullseye: A High-throughput Testing System of Neoepitopes to Enhance Cancer Cell Targeting in Immunotherapy Treatments Alexis Jacobson, Biology Sponsor(s): Professor Michelle Krogsgaard, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Perlmutter Cancer Center; Dr. Yury Patskovsky, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Perlmutter Cancer Center; Dr. Apoorvi Tyagi, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Perlmutter Cancer Center Linn-Cohen Family Research Scholar Targeting cancer neoantigens has emerged as a promising method of harnessing the immune system to specifically target cancer cells without harming healthy cells. Each tumor has different mutations and therefore, a unique set of tumor-specific proteins (neoantigens). In or - der to create an effective immunotherapy for each patient, the patient's own antibodies must be targeted to these per - sonal tumor neoantigens. In developing patient specific immunotherapy, these neoantigens must be identified and validated. We optimized the design of an immunogenicity testing system for multiple neoantigens at once.Previous studies have shown that the fusion of a ubiquitin protein to the N-terminal of a polypeptide increases entry of the attached protein to the antigen presentation pathway (Li et al. 2021). We are using ubiquitin in our system to make our neoantigen enter the antigen presentation pathway in an effort to upregulate the immune system against the tumor cells. Theoretical neoantigens can be identified through comparing the genomes of tumor and healthy tis- sues from a patient. These theoretical neoantigens are then inserted into our testing system's plasmid backbone and delivered to cells for presentation on major histocompat- ibility complexes (MHCs) at the cell surface. These cells are then co-cultured with immune cells isolated from the patient's blood for an accurate evaluation of neoantigen immunogenicity and therefore, candidacy for a personal- ized immunotherapy treatment. Functional Role of Transcription Factors in Regulating Neuronal Development in the Drosophila Visual System Maisha Jacy, Biology Sponsor(s): Dr. Yu-Chieh Chen, Biology Collegiate Research Scholar The central nervous system has tremendous neu- rodiversity with different molecular and morphological distinct neuronal types interconnected to form functional neuronal circuits. The molecular regulators controlling morphological features of different neuronal types during development remain to be elucidated. In the Desplan lab, we use the developing Drosophila visual system as a mod- el to address this question due to the extensive molecular and cellular characterizations of diverse cell types. For 84example, recent single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA- seq) data from our lab provides a comprehensive tran- scriptomic atlas for all optic lobe neurons of Drosophila. Among ~250 clusters identified by the scRNAseq analy- ses, I aimed to focus on three transcriptomically similar cell types (cluster 30, Lpi3-4, TmY14) and understand the molecular regulators underlying similarities and differ - ences in their neuronal morphologies. I hypothesized that the two unique transcription factors (CG32532 and Awh) shared among these three cell types play an important role in regulating their morphological similarities. I also iden- tified dozens of cell surface molecules that uniquely ex- press in one of the three cell types, which might be essen- tial for regulating distinct morphological features among these three cell types. I will use RNA interference tools to knock down candidate transcription factors and cell surface molecules via cell-type specific tools targeting each cell type and investigate their neuronal morpholog- ical features. The result of this project will shed light on the mechanisms underlying neuronal differentiation and allow further investigation of transcriptional regulation of neuronal morphological features during development. Neuron Generation using the Neurog-2 Transcription Factor Sebastian Jamshahi, Mathematics Sponsor(s): Professor Esteban Mazzoni, Biology Collegiate Research Scholar Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neuro- degenerative disease characterized by progressive neuro-nal death that affects thousands of people in the US every year. To study ALS, we need motor neurons, which we can generate from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). In our case, these are fibroblasts that are reprogrammed to have the potency of an embryonic stem cell. By forcing expression of the transcription factor Neurogenin 2 Our iPSC's are from the V AChT-td- Tomato patient cell line. This V AChT-dTomato cell line fluoresces red when the V AChT protein is expressed, a marker for cholinergic neurons, a subset of which in- clude motor neurons. Following a protocol from Eggan et al. 2022, we added small molecules retinoic acid (RA) and smoothened agonist (SAG) over a 10 day protocol (and maintained cells until day 28). To gather results we imaged cells on days 4, 7, 10, and 21 and had four con- ditions, a cell line with just Neurog-2 expression, a cell line with Neurog-2 and RA, a cell line with Neurog-2 and SAG, and a cell line with Neurog-2, RA, and SAG. On day 4, before the addition of RA and SAG, there was no sign of red fluorescence confirming the V AChT-tdTomato reporter is not leaky. On day 7, there was some level of red fluorescence across all variables, and on day 10, flu- orescence increased, but it was clear by the quantity and fineness of the neurites that the cells with just Neurog-2 and RA were the healthiest. Finally, on day 21, there was a lot more V AChT expression and the cells with Neurog-2 and SAG were not healthy. We confirm that RA serves 85as a neurotrophic factor, the V AChT-tdTomato cell line incorporated the Neurog-2 plasmid, and that the iPSC's differentiated into neurons and had varying levels of cho- linergic expression. To follow up, we would like to stain for Islet1 and Islet2, a motor neuron marker, to determine whether the neurons are indeed motor neurons or some other kind of cholinergic neuron, and we would also like to repeat the experiment with another cell line, with a dif- ferent reporter. Encoding Chirality in 3D DNA Crystals: From Primary to Tertiary Structures Jordan Janowski, Biochemistry Sponsor(s): Dr. Simon Vecchioni, Chemistry Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the molecule that makes up the origin of life, has revolutionized technology by forming nanostructures capable of embedding guest molecules and conducting electricity in nano electronics. DNA's programmability is being vastly researched to de- variability in base pairing, biomolecular sequenc- ing, and chirality. Double stranded, B-form DNA has been proven to align into three-dimensional crystal lattices in what is known as the tensegrity triangle, first published by Ned Seeman in 2009.Here we present enantiomeric tertiary structures of DNA crystals. B-form DNA, which typically has a right-handed tensegrity, is observed to also exhibit a left-handed helicity. This was first seen in com- parison of the 3T14 and 3T17 motifs, three-turn structures that differ in that the 3T14 has 14 interjunction base pairs while the 3T17, 17. The less interjunction base pairs, the less the DNA backbone of the center strand completes a full turn, and thus folds back on itself at the junction, forming a chiral secondary structure, the L1 junction, con- trary to the right-handed J1 structure. The chiral second- ary structure that was observed above was used to create a library of tertiary structures across two, three, and four turn structures, which is presented here as well. Chirality in nanostructures expands the field of nanotechnology ex- ponentially allowing not only the existence of a duplica- tion of structures but the ability to host proteins and met- als using non-native binding patterns in a DNA complex. Is \"Runner's High\" Driving Excessive Exercise in Anorexia Science Sponsor(s): Professor Chiye Aoki, Neural Collegiate Research Scholar Anorexia nervosa comprises three primary symp- toms including: excessive exercise, severe weight loss, and food restriction. Severe weight loss is a huge con- tributing factor to the high mortality rate of the disorder, which is the highest out of all psychiatric illnesses. My research primarily focuses on the excessive exercise com- ponent as it is the major contributor to weight loss. To study excessive exercise I work with an activity based an- orexia (ABA) model in mice where the mice are exposed to excessive exercise, food restriction, or both within their adolescence to observe its impact on their exposure to ABA in adulthood. The research focuses on why the mice who excessively exercise do it in the first place. It could potentially be attributed to the euphoric sensation produced during exercise known as \"Runner's High.\" En- dorphins and dopamine are two molecules known to be highly associated with this sensation. The ventral striatum is the region of the brain corresponding with addiction, especially within the nucleus accumbens. In order to dis- cover if it's the euphoric sensation motivating this exer - cise symptom I am quantifying the number of mu opioid receptors on dopaminergic axons in nucleus accumbens. Mu opioid receptors receive endorphins and suppress do- pamine release. If there are a large quantity of these recep- tors on dopaminergic axons it would suggest the euphoric sensation is most likely not attributed to the excessive running. In order to quantify the mu opioid receptors, I'm using immunoelectron-microscopy staining of tyrosine hydroxylase and mu opioid receptors to analyze where they overlap. Investigation of Spo15 Protein Function in Heterochromatin in S. Pombe Jenny Jin, Biology Sponsor(s): Professor Fei Li, Biology Collegiate Research Scholar My research project is focusing on investigating the function of Spo15 protein in heterochromatin formation in fission yeast. Heterochromatin is a crucial component of eukaryotic genomes, with diverse functions ranging from silencing gene expression to regulating DNA replication and repair. It is highly condensed and can be found in various regions of the genome, including the pericentro- meric and telomeric regions. Previous studies have shown that there are defects in silencing gene expression in the pericentromeric and telomeric regions in Spo15 deletion mutants. In this study, I aimed to investigate how Spo15 protein affects silencing in these regions by using GFP as a tag to monitor its activity without disrupting the pro- tein's structure. To accomplish this, I generated a Spo15 mutant protein strain with GFP fused to the C terminus of Spo15 and expressed it together with a strain containing a reporter gene, ura4, at the otr3:r2 and telomere regions. My specific focus was to determine whether the Spo15 protein mutation could target the pericentromere and telo- mere gene silencing when linked to these regions. Over - all, this study aimed to shed light on the role of Spo15 protein in silencing gene expression in the pericentromer - ic and telomeric regions and how its mutation affects this process. The use of GFP as a tag and the analysis of the 86ura4 reporter gene provide a robust methodology for in- vestigating these important genomic processes. Analyzing AI-Generated Depictions of LSD-Induced Hallucinations: Implications Behind using AI to Visualize Human Altered States of Consciousness Nellie Jun, Neural Science Sponsor(s): Professor Anasse Bari, Computer Science Collegiate Research Scholar This study explores the use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools to generate images that depict the experiences of individuals on LSD. For my methodology, I used nat- ural language processing (NLP) to \"clean\" scraped data. I sourced my data from the Erowid website, a non-profit organization where users share their experiences with var - ious drugs. The data collected were from sections of the website that were deemed relevant, and a total of 2,423 entries were collected. After data cleaning and NLP anal- ysis, the most commonly used adjectives were input into Stable Diffusion to create AI-generated images of LSD hallucinations. I then plan to use machine learning algo- rithms to tag these images based on recurring shapes, col- ors, and patterns. The significance of this study is that it bridges the gap between the understanding of human ex- periences and the technology used to represent these ex- periences using AI. There is a lack of understanding about the exact hallucinations that occur during an LSD-in- duced experience; moreover, specific hallucinations expe- rienced by individuals with neurological disorders (such as schizophrenia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and epilep- sy) are largely not understood. This research will broad- en our understanding of human perception and provide a pathway to visualize human experiences with the aid of AI. The study will also introduce new methodologies for neuroscientists and AI researchers to better understand human perception. For example, the potential therapeu- tic benefits of psychedelics for mental disorders can be researched using AI models instead of relying on human or animal testing. This would limit the reliance on ani- mal testing and provide less resistance to studies directly testing drugs on humans. Overall, my research provides a novel approach to visualize human experiences using AI tools and has implications for broadening understanding of human perception in doing so. Developmental Ethanol Exposure Impairs Adult Sleep and Salience Network Connectivity in Mice Aayush Kaneria, Philosophy Sponsor(s): Professor Donald Wilson, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Child and Adolescent Psychology Collegiate Research Scholar Approximately one in one hundred children suf- fer from Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) in the United States. Children diagnosed with FASD have problems with memory, learning, attention, and commu- nication (Riley and McGee, 2005). In addition to these consequences, FASD disrupts normal sleeping patterns, leading to fragmented sleep, sleep deprivation, and hy- perarousal. Reduced sleep impairs cognition and mem- ory consolidation, whereas enhanced sleep duration or quality can facilitate cognition and memory consolida- tion (Barnes and Wilson, 2014). Thus, understanding how sleep is affected by developmental alcohol exposure could lead to sleep-related treatments for mitigating the cognitive and emotional problems associated with FASD. Different, scattered regions of the brain can work togeth- er as a network to support behavioral functions. Different networks support different functions. One such network, the Salience Network (SN), responds to biologically im- portant events (e.g., rewards, threats) and has a role in emotional regulation and cognitive processing (Chiog et al., 2013). A similar network is observed in mice (See- ley, 2019). This study examined whether developmental ethanol exposure impacts the SN function and whether this network is associated with sleep impairment. Mice that were sleep deprived showed increased activity in the SN compared to mice that were well rested, regardless of developmental treatment. However, SN functional con- nectivity in developmentally ethanol-exposed adult mice that were rested was most similar to that of sleep-deprived mice that were not ethanol-exposed. This suggests that the SN in developmentally ethanol-exposed mice functions as if it is sleep-deprived. The Impact of AI on the Job Market Jasmeen Kaur, Computer Science Sponsor(s): Professor Anasse Bari, Computer Science Collegiate Research Scholar The main goal of my research is to understand the concerns of the common public regarding the develop- ment of Artificial Intelligence. In simple words, AI in- volves using computers to perform tasks that traditionally require human intelligence but much faster and efficient- ly. Hence it can help a lot of employers reduce their la- bor costs in all types of industries such as law, medicine, tech etc. While articles out there are trying to highlight the negatives of AI leaving people unemployed, I would like to explore the positive aspect of this development and its contribution to job creation. To do so, I will be moving my research in three phases. Phase one will be literature review to understand the major gaps that exist about the advantages of AI. I am also trying to understand what kind of jobs will potentially be replaced by AI. Phase two will be conducting a survey to gather primary public opinion about what types of jobs do they think will be replaced by AI and is their job one of them? Are people truly afraid about being unemployed due to AI advancements? Since I want to help people to get a fair tradeoff if and when their 87jobs get disrupted by AI, this survey is also expected to help brainstorm ideas about alternative jobs that people would like to be offered if they have to leave their current job. Lastly the third phase will be dedicated to putting to- gether all the information for the general public, talking about the advantages of AI and the details about the jobs it will create Using Predictive Analytics to Analyze Bias in Nagorno-Karabakh Media Coverage Diana Kazarian, Mathematics, Data Science Sponsor(s): Professor Anasse Bari, Computer Science; Alexa Amore, Art History Collegiate Research Scholar Azerbaijan's invasion of Nagorno-Karabakh and subsequent war with Armenia in 2020 prompted a remark- ably consistent set of reactions among Western conserva- tive journalists. Many right-wing outlets focused heavily on the religious identities of the two nations, effectively framing the invasion as \"Christians vs. Muslims,\" which ignores more significant geopolitical factors like the lega- cy of the USSR and the nations' alliances with surround- ing countries. Here, we assess the role of religion in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict by reviewing historical data and considering the perspectives of Armenian and Azer - baijani historians. This study hypothesizes that while re- ligion might have influenced the respective nationalisms of both nations following the dissolution of the USSR, its impact could be too limited to justify a religion-focused media narrative. To supplement our historical analyses and quantify the prevalence of religious framing during the 2020 war, we collected over 800 news articles across the entire political spectrum and designed experiments to apply text analytics algorithms to extract key phrases and sentiment for the purpose of modeling the writing style for each outlet. Preliminary experimental results suggest that some outlets might have emphasized religion more than others. The study presents a predictive analytics ex- perimental tool that uses machine learning to categorize and determine their relative degree of bias specifically for the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict that could serve as a proof-of-concept for a more general Artificial Intelligence tool for bias detection in news articles. The Neural Mechanism of Semantic Knowledge Generalization in Rodents Kirill Kiselev, Neural Science, Psychology Sponsor(s): Winnie Yang, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Neuroscience Institute Collegiate Research Scholar The neural mechanisms underlying the ability to generalize information learned from one context to an- other have been questioned by neuroscientists studying memory for a long time. We hypothesize that mice are able to effectively generalize semantic knowledge across different contexts. To study this, we designed a task where animals learn a cue-guided decision-making task in a fa- miliar environment over 2 weeks, and then generalize the same rule to different novel contexts. We discovered an interesting 'learning to generalize' phenomenon where (1) animals are able to generalize effectively to the first nov- el environment, measured by the amount of time it takes to learn in the novel environment compared to the famil- iar one, (2) once animals successfully generalize to the first environment, they display 'one shot learning', where they rapidly generalize to the third maze with much high- er learning rate. We implanted silicon probes to record from the CA1 area of the hippocampus while the animal learns to generalize. We record from hundreds of neurons during learning as well as the sleep period before and after learning on the maze, which gives us opportunities to dis- sect the memory consolidation mechanism during sharp wave ripples (SWRs) that occur during learning as well as during sleep. Optogenetic Manipulation of Dentate Inhibitory Phase Locking in a Mouse Model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Cassidy Kohler, Neural Science Sponsor(s): Dr. Zoe Christenson Wick, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Neuroscience Collegiate Research Scholar Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a neurological disorder accompanied by chronic spontaneous seizures and significant cognitive deficits. Though a number of treatments for seizures exist, none currently address the cognitive symptoms of TLE. Thus, there is a critical need to improve our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying TLE pathology. Previous research has found that hippocampal synchronization to the theta oscillation is disrupted in the epileptic brain. The theta oscillation is an endogenous rhythm that organizes local hippocampal activity. Typically, inhibitory neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus fire at the trough of theta. In epilepsy, however, inhibitory neuron firing is distributed across all phases of theta. We hypothesize that this altered inhibitory theta phase locking may play a causal role in the cognitive symptoms of TLE, as we predict that properly timed DG inhibition is critical for hippocampal function- ing. Using the pilocarpine mouse model of TLE, we per - formed optogenetic manipulations of inhibitory DG neu- rons to test the impact of DG phase locking on cognition. We utilized PhaSER, an algorithm that allows us to detect theta phases in real-time and apply phase-spe- cific manipulations, while mice performed a navigation task. We found that forcing an abnormal pattern in con- trol animals by shifting firing to the peak of theta induces cognitive deficits. Furthermore, preliminary data suggests 88that cognitive performance may be improved in epilep- tic mice by realigning firing to the trough of theta. These findings identify a potential target for future TLE thera- peutics that can address cognitive symptoms. Double Duty: Exploring Dual Tasking on the Nonparetic Side of Stroke Patients Amalia Korniyenko, Biology Sponsor(s): Emily Fokas, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Neurology; Dr. Heidi Schambra, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Neurology Collegiate Research Scholar As the leading cause of disability in the United States, stroke limits one's ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs). Dual-tasking is the performance of two actions simultaneously, that we assessed through du- al-object primitives (DOPs), a functional strategy to man- age two objects at the same time. We previously studied dual-tasking in chronic stroke and healthy participants, and found that DOP initiation was reduced in the paretic upper extremity (UE) of stroke subjects and in the non- dominant side of control UEs, but DOP frequency was unaffected. However, we did not assess DOP performance on the nonparetic UEs of stroke participants, which might indicate that DOPs are incorporated as a compensatory strategy, accounting for the reduced paretic DOP use that we previously found. Here, we studied 43 participants with chronic stroke and UE motor impairment performing DOPs on their nonparetic side, during feeding and tooth- brushing tasks. We videotaped the performance of these tasks and analyzed them for the initiation and frequen- cy of DOPs. Our results indicated that DOPs were more frequently initiated in the dominant and nonparetic upper extremities of stroke subjects compared to their nondom- inant and paretic counterparts. This finding implies that dominance and paresis can restrict the utilization of DOPs in some individuals. As skilled movement by the nondom- inant and paretic UE is associated with expanded brain activation the heightened demands of DOPs could surpass the available neural resources, leading to a decline in their execution in the paretic side. Effect of Age on Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (SLT) as Primary Therapy in Patients with Glaucoma: 20 Year Experience Bindu Koyi, Biology Sponsor(s): Dr. Lawrence Jindra, Floral Park Ophthalmology Collegiate Research Scholar Glaucoma is the leading cause of blindness in the United States and the loss of vision is caused by elevat- ed intraocular pressure (IOP)-the fluid pressure of the eye (Lee and Higginbotham, 2005). Selective Laser Trabecu- loplasty (SLT) has become an integral part for the treat-ment of glaucoma due to its ability to treat the trabecular meshwork without causing any thermal or coagulative damage to the surrounding structures (Latina et al., 1995). Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (SLT) utilizes a low en- ergy (532nm), Q-switched frequency Nd: YAG Laser to target the trabecular network and in turn reduce IOP (Latina et al., 1998). The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of SLT in reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with primary glaucoma across three age ranges: 40-60 years, 60-80 years, and 80-100 years, over an ex- tended 20-year period. A retrospective chart review was performed of 1160 eyes that had undergone SLT over 20 years and randomly selected three sample sets of 30 eyes each. Two-tailed paired t-tests were performed to compare pre- and post-procedure IOP values. Specifically, for pa- tients aged 40-60 years, there was a 33% decrease in IOP after 20 years, while patients aged 60-80 years and 80-100 years experienced a 36% and 27% decrease, respective- ly. The p-values confirmed a significant correlation be- tween pre- and post-SLT IOP values, demonstrating that selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) as primary (initial) therapy significantly lowered intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with glaucoma regardless of age differences. Shortcomings of Mathematical Approaches to Urban Mobility Technology: How Abstraction in Artificial Intelligence Hinders the Development of Ethical and Sustainable Solutions Nicoleta Krenteras, Mathematics, Environmental Studies Sponsor(s): Professor Jeff Sebo, Environmental Studies Abstraction is the core of math, computer science, and artificial intelligence. Abstraction is the process of us- ing underlying structures or patterns and removing them from their contexts to be more easily understood or gen- eralized. However, when applying this technology to cre- ate smart urban mobility, the process of abstraction can put environmental, ethical, and social goals at risk. When solving environmental problems, it is important to look at an issue in the context of the system it exists in- no system is observed in isolation. This is particularly true in urban environments which, in addition to careful con- sideration of ecological factors, requires increased sen- sitivity to cultural and social nuances. These social and ethical factors which are filtered out by artificial intelli- gence driven decision-making technology. While there is a push to create more \"holistic\" smart cities- ones which consider policy, environmental, financial, and social well- being factors when implementing technology, the inherent abstraction in math goes directly against the core princi- ples of solving environmental problems. The study ex- amines how abstraction and different conceptualizations and problem-solving in mathematics hinder ethical and environmentally sustainable urban mobility technology. I will use the case study of the failed Sidewalk Labs proj-89ect in Toronto to further explore these topics. The Side- walk Toronto Project used data from constant surveillance to manage all aspects of the city- from water and waste management to traffic coordination. The Quayside proj- ect's proposed mobility planning system exemplifies how technology fails to account for ethics and environmental sustainability. Applications of Linear Algebra and Basis Transformations on Camera Modeling Victor Kuang, Physics; Sean Ku, Mathematics, Physics Sponsor(s): Professor David Hogg, Physics Collegiate Research Scholar In its essence, the picture taking process of a cam- era can be thought of as a projection from 3D to 2D space. In the simplest case, when the focus plane of a camera is assumed to be perfectly parallel with the lens, the exact orientation and sizing of the image can be derived from the concept of similar triangles. In practice however, the fo- cus plane is often placed in a non parallel orientation with different surface areas, this leads to distortions and tears in the final image. Drawing inspiration from Professor Rob- ert Collins' lecture on computer vision at Penn State, this project offers a solution to this problem from notions in the math field of linear algebra. Specifically we utilize the notions of projection matrices and basis transformations, where then a \"coordinate shifting\" operator matrix can be derived that transforms the world's 3d coordinates to 2d coordinate with its origin at the center of the camera lens. This process is then redone based on the specific plane orientation and coordinates of the focus plane, where a final image can be produced. Aside from the theoretical background, we have also applied this project in practical form through a Python code, where a nine parameter code allows us to predict the final produced final image for any three dimensional object in real space. Remarks on the Two-point String Amplitudes Nicholas Labranche, Physics, Mathematics Sponsor(s): Professor Gaston Giribet, Physics Collegiate Research Scholar The two-point string amplitude at tree level in flat spacetime reproduces the expected expression for free particles. This has been proven by Erbin, Maldacena, and Skliros in [JHEP 07 (2019) 139] in two different ways. Here, we provide an alternative proof of this result. Our method consists in considering a timelike Liouville direc- tion as a regularization parameter, which suffices to break time translation invariance and, at the same time, to sta- bilize the residual conformal symmetry in the worldsheet. This allows taking a limit and restoring Poincar\u00e9 symme- try in a controlled way, thus reproducing the correct ex- pression of the two-point amplitude.Identifying the Role of Cingulate Cortex in a Listening Effort Task in Gerbils Vivian Lee, Global Public Health, Sociology Sponsor(s): Dr. Kelsey Anbuhl, Neural Science Collegiate Research Scholar Listening effort is the mental effort that is required for a listener to hear and understand sounds, like speech. Hearing loss can present as an obstacle, as people with hearing loss have to exert more listening effort than those without hearing loss. This can lead to chronic cognitive fatigue and can have negative consequences for quality of life. Unfortunately, not much is known about the neural mechanisms that contribute to listening effort. Evidence from human neuroimaging studies suggests that the cin- gulate cortex is recruited when listening conditions are difficult. Therefore, my research question for this project will be understanding the role of the cingulate cortex on an auditory behavior task of varying listening difficul- ty. My role in this project is to train gerbils on the task, process, and analyze the data collected to understand the relationship between the listening conditions and percep- tual performance. I will train the animals until they meet the criteria for completing psychometric testing, and then they will be implanted in the cingulate cortex with a mul- tichannel electrode array. We will then observe the firing rates of cingulate cortex neurons while animals perform the task, and then vary the listening difficulty. In the long term, we aim to examine the neurons in the cingulate cor - tex of gerbils with hearing loss and compare them to those of gerbils without hearing loss to see whether neurons ex- hibit differences with listening effort. Probing Nucleocytoplasmic Transport using Fluorescent Proteins Allison Levin, Physics Sponsor(s): Professor Alexandra Zidovska, Physics Howard Levene (WSC '41) Research Scholar In the cell nucleus, vital functions such as gene transcription, genome replication, and DNA repair occur in conjunction with molecular transport in and out of the cell nucleus. Molecular products of these processes often exit the nucleus and are used in the cytoplasm, e.g. mRNA, while proteinaceous machinery synthesized in the cyto- plasm is brought inside the nucleus. These proteins pass the nuclear envelope through nuclear pores when entering or exiting the nucleus. The goal of this project is to inves- tigate the active transport of proteins in and out of the cell nucleus by measuring protein fluxes through the nuclear envelope. In addition, we aimed to reveal the mechanism by which the nuclear envelope mediates nucleo-cytoplas- mic transport. Recently, the Zidovska lab discovered that the nuclear envelope fluctuates at short times (seconds) and the amplitude of these fluctuations decreases during the cell lifetime [Chu et al, PNAS, 2017]. Here, we studied 90the effect of these fluctuations on the nuclear transport by using the fluorescent protein mCherry, which we attached to nuclear import/export signals, thus enabling their active transport in/out of the nucleus. We measured the time-de- pendent concentration profiles of these proteins across the nuclear membrane to elucidate active nuclear trans- port of proteins. This benefited our understanding of ac- tive non-equilibrium processes in the cell, specifically the nucleo-cytoplasmic transport. Such knowledge may have implications for understanding human diseases, such as developmental and neurodegenerative disorders, rooted in malfunctions of the nucleo-cytoplasmic transport. Generating MiMIC-split-GAL4 Genetic Drivers via in vivo Crosses April Li, Biology Sponsor(s): Professor Claude Desplan, Biology; Dr. David Chen, Biology Collegiate Research Scholar Our lab has recently shown that gene-specific T2A- split-GAL4 lines recapitulate well with the scRNAseq data compared to the enhancer-based split-GAL4 lines. However, converting the existing MiMIC/CRIMIC lines into gene-specific T2A-split-GAL4 lines required embryo injection of corresponding donor DNA, which is often expensive when outsourcing Drosophila microinjection services to a company. This project aims to generate MiMIC-split-GAL4 driver via in vivo crosses, which can provide a cheaper alternative to traditional microinjection methods by setting up four rounds of crosses. First, we cross female flies carrying the T2A-split-GAL4 donor se- quence with male flies carrying the MiMIC insertion and select offspring that have both donor and MiMIC genetic components. Next, we cross male offspring with female flies carrying hs-Cre and vas-PhiC31 and then select male offspring that carry all three genetic components (hs-Cre, vas-PhiC31, donor and MiMIC) from the parents. By crossing them with female double balancer genes under 29\u00acC, we can induce the expression of Cre and thus ex- cise the split-GAL4 donor into the circular DNA, which will then be integrated into the MiMIC insertion site by the Recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) process. We select the males that are successfully swapped and then do a single male fly cross with a double balanc- er female to establish potential crosses. However, since the PhiC31 system does not recognize orientation, the split-GAL4 fragments can be inserted in either direction. Therefore, we will design gene-specific primers and run genotyping PCR to test the orientation before establishing stable stocks of the MiMIC-split-GAL4 driver line.Typicality Algorithms for Partial Trace Estimation Kevin Li, Mathematics, Computer Science; Xinran Li, Mathematics, Computer Science; Robert Chen, Mathematics, Computer Science; Yilu Pan, Mathematics; Yixin Wang, Computer Science, Mathematics Sponsor(s): Dr. Tyler Chen, Mathematics, Computer Engineering Collegiate Research Scholar We develop an algorithm to efficiently estimate the partial trace of exp(-H/t), where H is an explicitly known Hamiltonian matrix and t is the inverse temperature. This can be used to obtain the reduced density matrix for a subsystem of a quantum system. If we have an explicit representation of a matrix A, computing the partial trace of A is simple. However when A = exp(-H/t), the cost to compute and/or store A is too expensive. To address this issue, we use a stochastics trace estimator for A, which only accesses A through matrix-vector products. The sto- chastics estimator introduces variance to the output, and to deal with the potentially large variance of it, we pro- pose a variance reduction method based on extracting a low-rank approximation of A. Specifically, we consider various ways to compute the low-rank approximation of A and conduct numerical experiments to study differences in the run time, space complexity, and accuracy. Importance of Inner Retinal Thickness and Brain Metabolites to Glaucoma using Information Gain Assessment Jeremy Li, Biology Sponsor(s): Professor Kevin Chan, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Ophthalmology Collegiate Research Scholar Recent studies have found the involvement of brain metabolites in both human and experimental animal models of glaucoma. However, it is unclear how import- ant such metabolic changes are contributing to the dis- ease. Here, we analyzed clinical ophthalmic assessments and brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy data for early glaucoma, advanced glaucoma, and healthy control sub- jects using information gain assessment. Stepped Equilibria Pressure Profile in Plasma Containment Yuelong Li, Mathematics, Physics Sponsor(s): Professor Antoine Cerfon, Mathematics Collegiate Research Scholar The dynamics of plasma (4th state of matter) are approximately governed by a set of equations called the MagnetoHydroDynamics conditions (MHD). The project aims to determine the multiple Woltjer-Taylor equilibrium states in plasma systems given the same set of reaction pa- rameters. The results can inform the geometry and dynam- ics of plasma equilibriums inside magnetic confinements 91that are meaningful in the settings of controlled fusion. We modified the constant pressure constraint due to the conservation of mass, since in an ideal MHD the pressure and plasma density follow the relation PV^(5/3)=constant under adiabatic assumption. With the new conservation conditions, i.e., helicity and mass, additional degrees of freedom are introduced, which allows for a continuous manifold extending from each of the original static equi- librium solutions. Varying the field configurations along this manifold so as to reduce the global energy induces a continuous \"path\", parameterized by energy, that have the potential to inform the adiabatic evolution of magnetically confined plasmas under ideal MHD conditions. Mechanical Exfoliation of h-BN as Dielectric in Josephson Junction Fabrication Sally Liang, Physics Sponsor(s): Professor Javad Shabani, Physics Collegiate Research Scholar Among 2D materials, hexagonal boron nitride (h- BN) has been widely investigated as a promising substi- tute for metal oxide as a gate dielectric in quantum devic- es. Oxides are normally used as the gate dielectric, but the utilization of oxides creates charge traps at the interface of the surface channel and dielectric which leads to unin- tentional doping. Integrating h-BN as a gate dielectric can help reduce the doping due to its ideal characteristics such as its dangling-bond-free surface. Our method adopted in fabricating h-BN layers is mechanical exfoliation. In this method we split the bulk h-BN crystal into increasingly thinner flakes using the tapes and then transfer the tar -get flakes onto Josephson junctions by temperature-con- trolled dry pick-up process. Further, we investigate how the utilization of h-BN will affect the electrical properties of Josephson Junctions with h-BN gate dielectric. Pretrain & Finetune: Train Your Denoising Network on Limited Data with Transfer Learning Peiqi Liu, Computer Science, Mathematics Sponsor(s): Professor Carlos Fernandez-Granda, Mathematics; Professor Matan Leibovich, Mathematics Collegiate Research Scholar After deep learning is introduced into the field of deep learning, using a lot of data training a good denoising neural network becomes the common manner to denoise image. Even though some denoising algorithms such as Self2Self successfully cuts the neural network's depen- dency on amount of training data, most algorithms such as supervised denoising, Noise2Self, Neighbor2Neighbor still requires large amount of noisy images (or noisy-clean image pairs) in order to succeed. If we are trying to de- noise natural images, the amount of data is not a big prob- lem because we already have large natural image datasets such as COCO and ImageNet. What we need to do is sim- ply add some noise to clean images in these datasets and we should have enough data to train the denoising net- work. However, if we want to denoise other images such as microscopy images, we might not be able to access a lot of in-distribution image data. Fortunately, in this research, we find that we can pretrain a supervised learning algo- rithm on a large synthetic noisy natural image dataset (by adding noise on ImageNet validation dataset) and fine- 92tune on limited noisy microscopy images which we are about to denoise using self supervised methods such as Noise2Self. More specifically, we find that by fixing low level feature weights of the neural network can facilitate fine-tuning to shift the neural network from the ImageNet distribution to synthetic microscopy image distribution. Collimating the Growth of Twisted Crystals of Achiral Compounds Idalys Lozano, Biochemistry Sponsor(s): Professor Stephanie Lee, Chemistry; Professor Zhihua An, Chemistry Collegiate Research Scholar A great proportion of molecular crystals can be made to grow as twisted fibrils. Typically, this requires high crystallization driving forces that lead to spherulitic textures. Micron size channels fabricated from poly(di- methylsiloxane) (PDMS) serve to collimate the circular polycrystalline growth fronts of optically banded spheru- lites of twisted crystals of three compounds, coumarin, 2,5-bis(3-dodecyl-2-thienyl)-thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole and tetrathiafulvalene. The relationships between helicoidal pitch, growth front coherence and channel width are measured. As channels spill into open spaces, collimated crystals 'diffract' via small angle branching. On the oth- er hand, crystals grown together from separate channels whose bands are out of phase ultimately become a single in-phase bundle of fibrils by a cooperative mechanism yet unknown. The isolation of a single twist sense in individ- ual channels is described. Collimated twisted crystals in micro-fabricated polymer channels combine the advan- tages of molecular crystals and dissymmetry/chirality. Molecular crystals and photoluminescent molecular crys- tals are viable candidates for passive and active wave- guides, respectively. A Novel Pathway to Regulate Protein Synthesis during Synaptic and Memory Consolidation Emily Lu, Neural Science Sponsor(s): Dr. Mauricio Oliveira, Neural Science Foundational research and more recent work demonstrate that de novo protein synthesis is required for long-term memory (LTM) formation. Protein syn- thesis can be regulated through the integrated stress re- sponse (ISR), a signaling process which the cell deploys in response to stress. ISR regulates translation initiation through the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 complex (eIF2) on the alpha subunit, eIF2. The phosphorylation of eIF2 reduces protein synthesis while also upregulating synthesis of other proteins, including transcription factors, which help to restore homeostasis. Recently, eIF2 has been implicated as a key regulator of memory consolidation, and its increased phosphorylation plays an important role in neurodegenerative dementias, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The induction of learn- ing has been shown to lead to rapid eIF2 dephosphor - ylation in the hippocampus, a brain structure essential for memory consolidation, and concomitant increase in protein synthesis. However, the mechanisms underlying eIF2 regulation in the brain are still not well known. We investigated the processes leading to eIF2 dephosphor - ylation shortly after neuronal activation and their role in long-term memory formation. We found that growth ar - rest and DNA damage-inducible protein (GADD34), a scaffolding protein that promotes eIF2 dephosphoryla- tion under stress conditions, acts in synergy with actin dy- namics to promote neuronal translation initiation. Overall, our research suggests a novel pathway that connects ac- tivity-induced changes in the cell with long-term memory formation. Through this research, we better our under - standing of biochemical processes in long-term memory formation as well as our ability to identify potential effec- tive treatments for diseases like AD. Reduction in Chronic Stress-induced Anxiety- and Depressive- like Behaviors following a Single Treatment with Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD) Angela Ma, Sociology Sponsor(s): Professor Sarah Mennenga, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Psychiatry and Neuroscience/ Physiology; Professor Tanya Sippy, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Psychiatry and Neuroscience/ Physiology Collegiate Research Scholar The NYU Langone Center Medi- cine Institute to investigate neural mechanisms underlying psychedelic-assisted psychother - apy. Psychedelic drugs, including receptor ag- onists and produce strong consciousness-altering effects in humans. Published results from CPM demonstrate psy- chedelic treatment, with psychotherapy, produces rapid, robust, and enduring anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects in patients with life-threatening cancer (Grob et al., 2011, Ross et al., 2016, Griffiths 2016). Chronic stress-induced anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors are commonly assessed in rodents and align with symptom reductions reported in cancer patients following psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, but evaluation of these behaviors requires tracking of freely-moving animals. DeepLabCut is a ma- chine learning algorithm based on transfer learning with deep neural networks with advantages over alternative methodologies of tracking animal behavior, ie. track- ing multiple animals and complex poses (Mathis et al., 2018). We utilized a chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) paradigm, which randomly and unpredictably exposed mice to seven stressors over 18 days, to induce anxiety- 93and depressive-like behaviors, which was validated with DeepLabCut by evaluating CUS versus control mice in an Open Field task assessing anxiety-like behaviors. We assessed effects of IP injection of 200ug/kg LSD versus vehicle (saline) treatment in CUS mice and demonstrat- ed reductions in marble-burying and latency to feed in a novelty-suppressed feeding task, which evaluate chronic stress-induced anxiety-like behaviors, following treat- ment. These results provide a starting point to continue probing neural circuits underlying psychedelic-induced changes in anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors. \"Stepping Up\" Care: Patient Experiences of a Tailored Intervention Targeting Foot Self-care Practices to Prevent Ulcer Recurrence in Dr. Sundar Natarajan, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Medicine Collegiate Research Scholar Veterans with diabetic foot complications have as high a risk for death as those with cancer or cardiovascu- lar disease, emphasizing the need to prevent it. Despite advances, preventive foot self-care remains suboptimal in diabetes. Tailored interventions (TI) may promote better self-care, and dermal thermometry may also pre- vent foot complications. We tested a TI incorporating dermal thermometry by a randomized controlled trial using a nested qualitative study within it to understand patient experience of the comprehensive TI aimed at low- ering ulcer recurrence among individuals with previous diabetic foot ulcers.The TI included regular counseling calls, plantar thermometry feedback, and daily checklists. Using semi-structured interviews at 6 and 18 months of the TI, we assessed participant experience and reviewed suggestions for improvement to help future patients, in- terviewing 25 (21%) of the 120 TI participants who were randomly selected. Participants generally found program resources helpful in bringing new awareness and atten- tion to foot-care practices. Most were satisfied with the simplicity of the program and felt that alterations in their behavior were easy to incorporate into existing care rou- tines. Participants reported a decline in the use of the foot thermometer but a continuation of other learned foot self- care behaviors after their study participation concluded. These findings illustrate the feasibility and acceptability of theory-based TI targeting crucial behaviors that can reduce foot complications in diabetes. We gained an en- hanced understanding of the multi-dimensional issues pa- tients with advanced diabetes face. This will help inform future implementation research for clinical translation.Characterizing the Selectivity of Manipon, Biochemistry Sponsor(s): Professor David Stokes, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology; Dr. Adel Hussein, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology Julie C. Schiefflin Research Scholar The potassium pump Kdp, whose expression res- cues bacteria in low-potassium conditions, harnesses the chemical energy of ATP to transport potassium into the cell against extreme gradients, thus maintaining many physiological processes. Ion transport can be categorized into two types - passive and active transport. The com- ingling of these mechanisms hardly occurs; however, unique to the KdpFABC complex, there exists a hybrid of two types of transporters, with the KdpA subunit serving as a potassium channel and the KdpB subunit serving as a potassium pump. Despite decades of research, a complete characterization of KdpA and KdpB interactions and their connection have yet to be defined. The currently-accept- ed mechanism proposes that ions are transported across the cellular membrane via an inter-subunit tunnel through KdpA and KdpB. This feature promises mechanistic and evolutionary insights to our understanding of ion trans- porters across the energetic spectrum through studying the KdpFABC complex. Moreover, it suggests that there ex- ists an evolutionary advantage from coupling the two sub- units. Our current hypothesis implies that the selectivity filter of the KdpA subunit serves to assist the KdpB pump. The goal of this project is to analyze the selectivity of Kd- pFABC towards different ions when altering significant residues along this pathway through a mutagenesis study. Our results support the conclusion that a mutation of the KdpA selectivity filter has a decoupling effect on the two main subunits, reducing the activity of the KdpB pump. . Characterization of Photoresponsive 1,2-Bis(2-methyl- 5-phenyl-3-thienyl)perfluorocyclopentene Twisted Crystalline Films Merritt McDowell, Chemistry, English and American Literature Sponsor(s): Professor Stephanie Lee, Chemistry Collegiate Research Scholar In recent decades, interest has flourished in mo- lecular crystals demonstrating mechanical responses to external stimuli, as they provide promising routes for op- toelectronic development in memories and switches. One such material is 1,2-bis(2-methyl-5-phenyl-3-thienyl)per - fluorocyclopentene (BpFCP), reported by Kitagawa et al. (2018) to reversibly twist/untwist from a thin-ribbon sin- gle crystal (and change color) after UV and visible light irradiation from a photoinduced ring closure mechanism. Additional attention has been paid to molecular crys-94tals that exhibit growth-actuated twisting from the melt, forming thin films of banded spherulites composed of crystalline fibers which concertedly twist outwards from a central nucleation site and expose alternating crystal ori- entations. Here, BpFCP was found to twist in thin films when crystallized from the melt at 80-100\u00b0C. It was dis- covered that alternating bands of BpFCP spherulites turn blue upon irradiation with light of 405 nm wavelength, quantified by large absorbance increases in specific bands measured through time- and band-dependent UV-visible spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction analysis further indicated a change in unit cell dimensionality in irradiated films due to intermolecular rearrangement of closed-ring (blue) iso- mers to obtain an energy-minimized crystal structure ex- ploiting greater degrees of -conjugation. Film crack for- mation observed through polarized optical and scanning electron microscopy suggested that fibrils also experience varying internal stress from photoisomerization-induced shifts in crystal lattice parameters as they mechanical- ly twist against one another. Thus, BpFCP proves to be an interesting candidate in studying molecular orienta- tion-dependence of dynamic photomechanical and pho- tochromic activity. Validation of a New Visual Oddity Task through Human and Monkey Contrast Sensitivity Comparison Christopher Morales, Neural Science Sponsor(s): Professor Najib Science Benjamin P .B. and Fannie L.G. Feldman Research Contrast Sensitivity (CS), or visual sensitivity at varying spatial frequencies, is an important baseline for understanding visual acuity, given its dependence on low-level visual processes (Casile et al., 2019; Butler et al., 2001). Evaluating contrast sensitivity can also serve as a diagnostic test to further approach more complex tasks, such as texture and object recognition. While many stud- ies have investigated contrast sensitivity functions (CSFs) in humans with and without visual impairments, we are unable to explore its physiological bases (Campbell et al., 1965; Freedman et al., 1975; Derefeldt et al., 1979). Due to physiological similarities to humans, non-human pri- mates (NHPs) have been the prime model to investigate these issues (Miller et al., 1980; De Valois et al., 1974). Previous studies have shown that humans generally have higher peak CS and visual acuity than NHPs (Ridder et al., 2019; De Valois, 1974). These studies used alternative forced choice, which requires participants to make a se- lection regardless of their certainty, or temporal-interval detection task, which requires active participation across multiple sensory-motor modalities (Harwerth et al., 1982). These experiments can be difficult to teach young NHPs and impose limitations on the complexity of what can be tested. Furthermore, when presented with a diffi- cult choice, NHPs, who display reward-seeking behavior, may ignore or guess on trials more often (Boudreau et al., 2006). To address these concerns, in our study we intro- duce the four-non-forced choice visual oddity task with noise, a non-forced-choice technique that relies on the participant's eye movements, which has not been previ- ously done. The introduction of noise provides the NHPs with constant targets to attend to while simultaneously al- lowing for the use of a non-forced-choice approach. With this, we ask the question of whether our CS task is both easy to teach NHPs and generalizable to more complex stimuli. We hypothesize that this recent technique will al- low for a more in-depth analysis of the participant's per - formance with consistent and replicable results, therefore solidifying its efficacy. To test for this, we use this new method to test for and compare the CSFs of humans and NHPs, and subsequently compare these results to previ- ous studies. We tested three normal humans and three nor - mal monkeys, though one was found to have diminished vision. In our study, we found that the monkey AA dis- played peak CS (46.9) not in the range of the humans test- ed (60-91.8), however, had peak spatial frequency (SF) and visual acuity (V A) (3.91 CS=34.4, peak SF=0.40 cpd, V A=4.34 cpd). Eye movement plots displayed less variability for SFs corresponding to peak CSs. Through our study, we not only concluded that the normal humans and normal monkeys had similar perfor - mance, proving our hypothesis correct, but also that this test provides information about those with less-than-ideal performance. With a new task methodology that is both easy and generalizable, we are able to interrogate the de- velopment of more complex visual processes. Elucidating the Pro-metastatic Mechanisms of CNDP1 in Melanoma Brain Metastases Maya Navarro, Global Public Health, Biology Sponsor(s): Professor Eva Hernando, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Pathology; Alcida Karz, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Pathology Collegiate Research Scholar Melanoma brain metastasis (MBM) occurs at ex- tremely high rates in Stage IV clinical cases compared to other cancers. However, the molecular basis for this is poorly understood. Previous unbiased proteomics analysis of melanoma short-term cultures revealed that carnosine dipeptidase (CNDP1) is pressed in melanoma cells explanted from brain metas- tases, compared with those derived from extracranial metastases. Therefore, our study aimed to determine the potential pro-metastatic role that CNDP1 protein plays in MBM. In vivo screens utilizing lentiviral shRNAs to si-95lence CNDP1 protein expression revealed that CNDP1 is critical for tumor seeding and outgrowth. This result was recapitulated in a therapeutic setting where we induced shRNAs to silence CNDP1 in pre-established in vivo tu- mors, although to a lesser efficiency. We next sought to characterize the specific metabolic pathways that CNDP1 deficiency disrupted in MBM samples. To this end, we conducted metabolomics assays which indicated that CNDP1 deficiency led to significant increases in transla- tional stress and anti-tumor immunosurveillance. This is significant as it implicates CNDP1 in a more expansive role than its current characterization as a ligand-specific dipeptidase. In sum, our results suggest that CNDP1 oc- cupies a novel pro-metastatic niche in MBM. With MBM patients currently having limited treatment options, this proteomics-based silencing of critical metastatic genes opens multiple avenues for future therapies. A Role for Cofilin in Philip Alfred Lotz Research Scholar Protein synthesis is required for synaptic plasticity. Previous studies have found that the translation initiation factor eIF2 is a hub effector to increase neuronal protein synthesis. After plasticity is induced, eIF2 is rapidly de- phosphorylated. However, there is little knowledge on the molecular mechanisms that lead to eIF2 dephosphory- lation. It has been well-studied that eIF2 is dephosphor - ylated during the integrated stress response (ISR), which is triggered in response to environmental and cellular stress. This dephosphorylation seems to be mediated by GADD34, an inducible scaffolding protein. We want to investigate the mechanism by which GADD34 mediates eIF2 dephosphorylation in physiological conditions and connect it to the events that occur in synaptic plasticity. Previously, our lab has observed that stimulating neurons with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) leads to an increase in GADD34 levels, which then promotes eIF2 dephosphorylation. We hypothesize that cofilin, an actin-binding protein, helps stabilize the interaction be- tween GADD34 and eIF2 to eventually lead to an in- crease in de novo protein synthesis. Arginine Interaction with Non-polar Branched Chain Amino Acids in Proteins Chris Ng, Chemistry; Vivian Kui, Chemistry; Betty Chemistry Sponsor(s): Professor Malgorzata Mandziuk, Chemistry Dr. Dorothy Starr Scholar Proximal interactions between Arginine (Arg) and Leucine (Leu) side chains are commonly found within pro- teins. Employing computational calculations and a model dimer system, the interactions between these side chains were explored. The model dimer system utilizes 2-meth- ylbutane as a truncated guanidini- a truncated Arg side chain. Advanced compu- tational techniques were applied, including the utilization of B3LYP+3D and wB97xd density functionals, the appli- cation of the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set, and implementation of Gaussian16 suite for computational calculations. The findings revealed close contacts resembling dihydrogen bonding and a notable interaction energy (7-8 kcal/mol) between guanidinium ion and 2-methylbutane. The strong interaction between guanidinium ion and branched chain amino acids is believed to disrupt hydrophobic contacts in proteins, causing denaturation and increased solubility of hydrocarbons in aqueous solutions containing guanidini- um chloride (a common denaturant). To compare Arg and Leu side chain distances in proteins, 1 \u00c5 resolution PDB files from PISCES servers were analyzed to identify close contacts (<3.5 \u00c5) between Arg and Leu. Among the 598 pairs that were less than 5 \u00c5 apart studied, 9 pairs were found with distances less than 3.3 \u00c5 - shorter than the shortest distance discovered in computational calculations (3.38 \u00c5). These results indicate stronger interactions be- tween Leu and Arg side chains, suggesting that Arg may be transiently doubly protonated and involved in proton transfer. The study proposes that branched aliphatic hy- drocarbons were chosen due to the increased stability of their cations when doubly protonated. Infant Temperament: Exploring the Potential Role of Maternal Dietary Choline and Folate Consumption during Pregnancy in a Michigan Pregnancy Cohort Daelah Nicholas, Neural Science Sponsor(s): Professor Jean Kerver, Michigan State University, Epidemiology and Biostatistics; Dr. Chia- Lun Yang, Michigan State University, Epidemiology and Biostatistics; Dr. Nicole Talge, Michigan State University, Epidemiology and Biostatistics Objective: Choline and folate are important nu- trients involved in fetal brain development, but relation- ships between diet and infant temperament-an outcome potentially related to neurobehavioral development-have not been widely explored. Our objective was to examine associations between maternal dietary choline and folate intake during pregnancy and infant temperament assessed at 9 months. Methods: Participants from the Michigan Archive for Research on Child Health (MARCH) pro- spective pregnancy cohort were included in this analysis (n=89, mean age [SD]=30.4\u00ac\u00b15.5 y). Maternal dietary intake was assessed in mid-pregnancy with the Automat- ed Self-Administered 24-hour Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA24). Infant temperament was assessed by parent report using the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised Very Short Form (IBQ-VSF) at the infant 9-month visit 96(range 8-16 months; mean [SD] 287\u00ac\u00b131 days after birth). Participants were included if they had data from at least one ASA24 and the IBQ-VSF assessment. Where appli- cable, the average of two ASA24s was used (n=45). For twins, infant data was randomly selected to include only one twin (n=2 mother-child pairs). Independent t-tests were used to assess mean differences in nutrient intake by maternal sociodemographic characteristics. Pearson correlations were used to examine relationships between maternal nutrient consumption and infant temperament scores. Results: Neither folate nor choline intake differed significantly by maternal age, education, marital status, or income. Maternal choline intake was related to infant Positive Affect/Surgency, r=0.213, p=0.045; when data were limited to the subset with two ASA24s (n=45), the relationship was no longer significant r=0.262, p=0.083. No significant relationships between maternal folate in- take and infant temperament were observed. Conclusions: Pregnancy dietary folate was not associated with par - ent-reported temperament at 9 months, but we observed an association between pregnancy dietary choline and Positive Affect/Surgency in infants.Exploring the Oltean, Biochemistry Sponsor(s): Professor School of Medicine, Pathology; Dr. Yury Patskovsky, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Pathology Although vaccination is highly efficient in protec- tion against SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, novel virus variants escape immune protection through frequent mutation and create a need to develop new vaccines every year. A solution to this problem involves generating immunity against evolutionary stable yet im- munogenic antigens. Some conserved antigens share similarity between different viruses of the same family. These antigens were discovered among coronaviruses, in- cluding SARS-CoV-2, and are responsible for long-term protection via cellular immunity. One such antigen is the HLA-B*07:02-specific nucleocapsid epitope N105-113, the sequence for which is similar to that of MERS and common cold coronaviruses. In this project, I refolded and isolated pMHCs of HLA-B*07:02 complexed with the corresponding epitopes from three different coronaviruses: SARS-CoV-2 and its Y7F mutant, MERS, and OC43. I have crystallized and solved the structure for the HLA-B*07:02/Y7F complex, and used the structure to model the HLA-B*07:02/MERS variant. Very high 97structural similarity and stability was observed between these pMHC of all three epitopes, suggesting that similar or identical T cell receptor sets will recognize these epi- topes and confer shared immunity to these viruses in the physiological setting. This mechanism of T cell cross-re- activity opens up a pathway to create universal T cell vac- cines against distinct viruses, utilizing the same approach to eventually improve cancer immunotherapy. Biosorption of CU(II) Ions by Green Tea and Peppermint Tea Waste Armin Osmanovic, Chemistry Sponsor(s): Professor Abel Navarro, Chemistry Biosorption is a remediation technique that uses natural materials to remove contaminants from an aque- ous solution (Torres, 2020). This study evaluates the po- tential of the biomaterials, green tea and peppermint tea, to remove Cu (II) ions from wastewater. Parameters such as pH, dose of adsorbent, contact time, salt effect, and crowding effect were studied to investigate their impact on the biosorption efficiency in batch adsorption experi- ments at room temperature. Scanning Electron Microsco- py and Energy Dispersion of X-Ray Spectroscopy studies were used to determine the chemical and morphological traits of the biosorbents. The results indicate that both green tea and peppermint tea maximizes the adsorption at pH 7 with 100mg of adsorbent. The data shows that both sorption processes are inhibited by the presence of salts, a metal cation, and an organic Radushkevich, Elovich, Jovanovic, and Temkin isotherm models were used to analyze equilibrium data. Maximum adsorption capacity for green tea and pepper - mint tea reached 33.91 mg/g and 96.62 mg/g, respective- ly. This data demonstrates the potential of spent tea leaves as inexpensive and eco-friendly candidates for the remov- al of copper from wastewater. Spectral Holography: Imaging Complex Systems with Broadband Sound Aashay Pai, Physics Sponsor(s): Professor David Grier, Physics Collegiate Research Scholar Conventional holograms record the structure of scattered waves at many spatial positions, but just one frequency. These holograms store information in the am- plitude and phase of the wave. Half this information is lost as these holograms only capture the intensity of the field. These recordings encode information about the po- sitions, sizes and material properties of the scatterers that can be extracted either by numerically reconstructing the three-dimensional wave or by analyzing the hologram with a generative model as an inverse problem. Much of the same information can be captured in the frequency de- pendence of the amplitude and phase of scattered waves recorded at a very small number of positions. While such spectral recording would be challenging in optical holog- raphy, it is a natural fit for acoustic holography. We in- troduce acoustic holography and as an extension spectral holography by demonstrating Lorenz Mie tracking and characterization of macroscopic objects with broadband sound. Uncovering the Origins of Foraging Western South Atlantic Green Turtles Guinevere Pandolfi, Global Liberal Studies, Biology Sponsor(s): Professor Genia Naro-Maciel, Global Liberal Studies Collegiate Research Scholar The green turtle (Chelonia mydas) is a globally endangered marine species and knowledge about their population connectivity is incomplete. Determining the missing behavioral data is crucial for developing conser - vation and management strategies. To gain a clearer un- derstanding of their migration patterns and gene flow, we performed a mixed stock analysis (MSA) and examined the population structure of two foraging grounds (FGs) from northern and southern Brazil. We sequenced two re- gions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from Sergipe (n = 32) and Santa Catarina (Florian\u00f3polis; n = 38). We found that rookeries located on Ascension Island and West Afri- ca contributed the most to the foraging grounds. The most common control region (D-loop) haplotypes discovered at Sergipe and respectively) and CM-A5.1 (21.9% and 18.4%, respectively) and the most common repeat region (STR) found at both sites was 7-12-4-4 (37.5% and 34.2%, re- spectively). Our data show that there may be a difference in which rookeries contributed to each foraging ground. When comparing the FGs to each other, the repeat regions were significantly differentiated, but the control regions were not. These findings suggest that the mtDNA regions have different mutation rates and evolve independently, the STR region being the more rapid. However, given the small sample sizes and the high confidence intervals (95%), there is a lower resolution as to which rookeries contributed to the FGs. We would expect Ascension Is- land to contribute the most and a greater CM-A5 frequen- cy in Sergipe (North Atlantic Haplotype). Teach a Robot to FISH: Versatile Imitation from One Minute of Demonstrations Jyo Pari, Computer Science, Mathematics Sponsor(s): Professor Lerrel Pinto, Computer Science Collegiate Research Scholar While imitation learning provides us with an effi- cient toolkit to train robots, learning skills that are robust to environment variations remains a significant challenge. Current approaches address this challenge by relying ei-98ther on large amounts of demonstrations that span environ- ment variations or on handcrafted reward functions that require state estimates. Both directions are not scalable to fast imitation. In this work, we present Fast Imitation of Skills from Humans (FISH), a new imitation learning approach that can learn robust visual skills with less than a minute of human demonstrations. Given a weak base-pol- icy trained by offline imitation of demonstrations, FISH computes rewards that correspond to the \"match\" be- tween the robot's behavior and the demonstrations. These rewards are then used to adaptively update a residual pol- icy that adds on to the base-policy. Across all tasks, FISH requires at most twenty minutes of interactive learning to imitate demonstrations on object configurations that were not seen in the demonstrations. Importantly, FISH is con- structed to be versatile, which allows it to be used across robot morphologies (e.g. xArm, Allegro, Stretch) and camera configurations (e.g. third-person, eye-in-hand). Our experimental evaluations on 9 different tasks show that FISH achieves an average success rate of 93%, which is around 3.8\u00c5 higher than prior state-of-the-art methods. Biochemistry Professor Michael Wosczyna, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Orthopedic Surgery Collegiate Research Scholar Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are a class of stem cells that are present in tissues throughout the body, including in skeletal muscle and adipose (fat) tis- sue. MSCs are crucial to overall health, as depletion of these cells results in reduced weight and skeletal muscle degeneration (Wosczyna, Konishi, et al., 2019). Adipose tissue is essential to many biological functions, including energy storage, metabolic health, and temperature regu- lation. However, excess adipose tissue is linked to obe- sity-related health risks. The purpose of this study was to determine the contribution of MSCs to adipocyte hyper - trophy and fat pad hyperplasia. Transgenic mouse models with GFP-labeled MSCs were challenged with a high fat diet (HFD) for up to 2 months. Data was collected through histological analyses of adipose tissue from this mouse model using a tape-transfer slide system. We determined that labeled MSCs increased their contribution to adipose tissue hyperplasia under HFD feeding. Specifically, MSC contribution was found to be 10.5% and 27.5% following 1 and 2 months of HFD challenge, respectively, both sub- stantial increases compared to the 5.3% contribution ob- served prior to HFD exposure. These data demonstrate the capacity of MSCs to directly differentiate into adipocytes in the process of hyperplasia. Further research is needed to determine how MSCs affect adipose tissue health and homeostasis.RNA-binding Protein Imp Regulates Olfactory Navigation Circuitry and Behavior in Drosophila Midhula Pillai, Neural Science Sponsor(s): Professor Katherine Nagel, School of Medicine, Neuroscience and Physiology; Hannah Gattuso, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Neuroscience and Physiology Collegiate Research Scholar The correct assembly of neural circuits during de- velopment is necessary for proper brain function. In this project, we explore the relationship between neural de- velopment, circuit structure, and behavior in Drosophila melanogaster, also colloquially known as the fruit fly. Cir - cuits carrying wind and odor information converge in the central complex (CX) and enable flies to navigate towards goals, such as food sources. The majority of CX neurons are derived from Type II neural stem cells (NSCs), which exhibit an evolutionarily conserved division pattern also seen in other insects and primates (Haubensak et al., 2004; Noctor et al., 2004). Imp, an RNA-binding protein ex- pressed in early Type II NSCs, has been previously shown to determine the identity of CX neurons (Liu et al., 2015). Here, we investigate how the modulation of Imp impacts the development of the olfactory navigation circuitry and goal-directed behavior. We show that Imp knockdown (KD) causes severe deficits in the morphology of major structures in the CX and alters the neuron count of specific populations. As a result, Imp KD flies have a significant decrease in upwind running speed and an increase in an- gular velocity during olfactory navigation. Imp KD flies show no differences in ground speed or movement prob- ability, suggesting a specific deficit in upwind orientation to an odor stimulus, rather than a general sensory or motor impairment. Collectively, our findings establish that CX circuitry specified by Imp early in development is critical for maintaining a heading direction towards a wind cue. Opening Doors to Development: Regulation of Zelda Target Genes during Genome Activation in Drosophila Michelle Pollak, Biology Sponsor(s): Professor Christine Rushlow, Biology Mary L. Santirocco Research Scholar Early gene regulation is a complex process that governs the expression and activity of genes during the embryonic period. There are many regulators of the ge- nome that play a part in early development, this is where we find Zelda, a key activator of the early zygotic genome in Drosophila (Liang et al. Nature 2008). By binding to chromatin and opening up regions of DNA that are initial- ly inaccessible, Zelda essentially opens the door for devel- opment to begin. Therefore, Zelda has been identified as one of the special transcription factors known as \"pioneer factors\". Pioneer factors are crucial in activating early wave genes that are essential for proper development as 99they encode signaling molecules and transcription fac- tors that regulate the development in subsequent embry- onic stages. Furthermore enhancing our comprehension on regulatory factors like Zelda can open a whole new understanding of normal development, the reasons and potential therapies behind some developmental disorders and illnesses. It is within this context that we began in- vestigating gene expression and Zelda binding in the ear - ly embryonic stages of Drosophila melanogaster. Using ChIP-seq data, we took great interest on where there was RNA Polymerase II binding and Zelda binding across the early genome, and we found that around 40% of the genes activated by Zelda are arranged in a pair-wise fashion (de- fined as less than 4kb apart from each other). Considering the critical nature of these genes, we wondered about the significance of this arrangement: How does their proxim- ity influence gene activation, transcriptional output, and subsequent embryo development? Random Walk in Random Environment Yichen Qian, Mathematics Sponsor(s): Professor Maximilian Nitzschner, Mathematics Joel and Shari Beckman Research Scholar Random walk in random environment (RWRE) is a mathematical model that has been widely used to describe the movement of particles in a random environment. In this project, we investigate the behavior of a particle moving in a random environment and explore the impli- cations of our findings in practical applications. Firstly, we review the mathematical foundations of RWRE, which include the existence and construction of random walk and Brownian motion, essential properties of Brownian motion, and Donsker's invariance principle. We then use MATLAB to simulate RWRE and incorporate the effects of drift and random conductance. Our simulation allows us to study the impact of different environmental setups on the particle's movement. In particular, we focus on the behavior of the particle when it encounters a \"trap,\" which is a region of the environment that prevents the particle from escaping. Our simulations have shown that the par - ticle can be trapped when the environment is set up in a certain way. In these situations, the particle's velocity sud- denly decreases, and we can see this by plotting the par - ticle's velocity. Through mathematical analysis and simu- lations, we aim to provide insights into the movement of particles in fields such as physics, chemistry, and biology.Improving Otsu's Thresholding Method of Global Binarization using Ring Theory for Ultrasounds of Congestive Heart Failure Alisa Rahim, Biology Sponsor(s): Dr. Esley Torres, Institute of Cybernetics, Mathematics, and Physics Ring Theory states that a ring is an algebraic struc- ture where two binary operations can be performed among the elements: addition and multiplication. Binarization is a method of image processing where values within pixels are reduced to a scale from zero to one, with zero repre- senting most absence of light and one representing most presence of light. Currently, sonograms - computer imag- es composed by movement of sound waves - are imple- mented in scanning for congestive heart failure. However, the renowned \"Playboy Bunny\" symbol representing the ailment becomes increasingly difficult to isolate due to surrounding organs and lower quality image productions. This paper examines the Otsu thresholding method and incorporates new elements to account for different image features meant to better isolate congestive heart failure indicators in ultrasound images. By treating the pixels of an image as elements of a ring, we are able to further par - tition regions of interest and surrounding organs to isolate ailment symbols. Early-life Social Adversity Disrupts Infant Amygdala and Use of the Mother as a Safe Haven Roshni Raj, Neural Science, Anthropology Sponsor(s): Professor Regina Sullivan, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Daniel Getman and Leonard Marker Memorial Research Scholar Early life trauma-induced brain changes are a major root of mental disorders. Limbic areas such as the amyg- dala are a major target. We used Adversity-Scarcity rear - ing of low bedding in rat pups (from postnatal days, PN8 to 12) modeling harsh parental care and the later life emer - gence of amygdala dysfunction in fear, social behavior, and hedonics. We investigated if infant adversity-rearing with the attachment figure (parent) disrupted one specific amygdala function: social buffering response to mater - nal presence to suppress fear. We hypothesized early life adversity would disrupt the mother's ability to function as a safe haven and be related to amygdala subareas that process input (lateral LA), olfactory relay (medial MeA), integration (basal BLA) of shock and mother information, and output (central CeA). This study hypothesized that as pups mature, the amygdala will respond less to the mother for input, output, and integration. Four treatment groups were assessed at two ages, older infancy (PN18) and juve- niles (PN28): control-reared shock alone, control-reared shock with mother, the adversity-reared shock alone, and adversity-reared shock with mother. 2-Deoxy-D-glucose 100(2-DG) autoradiography assessed neural activity during a 0.5mA shock (every 4 min) with or without the mother present (anesthetized). Results showed maternal presence at PN18 produces significantly different neural activity in the control-reared upper subareas of the BLA, disrupting the mother's ability to function as a safe haven. PN28 ad- versity-reared pups showed lowered 2-DG uptake in the dorsolateral subarea of the lateral amygdala, suggesting later-life processing circuitry differs from earlier life. Understanding the Structure of the Microsporidian Polar Tube using Cryo-Electron Tomography Medicine, Cell Biology; Professor Damian Ekiert, Cell Biology, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Cell Biology and Microbiology Collegiate Research Scholar Microsporidia are single-celled eukaryotic para- sites that infect a wide range of hosts and can cause fa- tal complications in immunocompromised humans. Two common human-infecting microsporidian species are Encephalitozoon intestinalis and Encephalitozoon hel- lem, and will be studied in this project. Microsporidia have evolved a unique organelle called the Polar Tube (PT), which is responsible for initiating infection in the host cell. To initiate infection, microsporidia extrude the PT, which pierces through the host cell membrane and is used to transport infectious cargo into the host cell. The PT exists as a tight coil inside the spore prior to germina- tion. Data collected through classical Transmission Elec- tron Microscopy has given us a 2-D view of the intact spore, and more recently 3-D reconstructions from Serial Block Face Scanning Electron Microscopy performed in our lab have given us insight into how the PT arranges itself around other organelles inside the spore. As under - stood from the reconstructions, the PT is seen arranged as tightly coiled in concentric circles around a central core, but at this resolution, the organization and composition of these layers remain unknown. This project, therefore, aims to use Cryo-Electron Tomography (cryo-ET) to ob- tain high-resolution information of the PT in its native coiled state in E.intestinalis and E.hellem spores. This will allow us to understand the structure and organization of the spore, and how the PT interacts with other organ- elles in the dormant spore. Through this project, we hope to develop a thorough understanding of the structure and architecture of the PT.Development of a PD1-LAG3 Fusion Decoy Protein to Prevent T-cell Suppression Eric Rao, Biology Sponsor(s): Professor Jun Wang, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Pathology; Jasper Du, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Pathology Schachter Family Research Scholar The immune system is critical to human survival, but must be carefully regulated in order to prevent autoim- mune responses. This regulation is accomplished through immunosuppressive \"checkpoint\" receptors on lympho- cytes, such as LAG3 and PD1. These immunosuppres- sive receptors are intended to suppress T cells, preventing the immune system from hyperactivation and attacking a person's own cells. However, many cancers often over - express the ligands of these immunosuppressive recep- tors, leading to decreased immune responses in the tumor microenvironment. Decoy proteins have been employed in many applications. Essentially, decoy proteins imitate another protein to interfere in a ligand-receptor binding interaction. This idea can be applied to decrease the im- munosuppressive activity of cancers. The goal of this project is to create a fusion decoy protein that contains both human LAG3 and PD1 (immunosuppressive recep- tors mentioned above). The premise is that this decoy pro- tein will bind to the ligands of these immunosuppressive receptors and prevent these ligands from binding to the \"real\" receptors on T cells. To increase the binding affin- ity of the decoy protein, I have also used a high-affinity PD1 mutant sequence discovered by Aaron Ring. Thus, this decoy protein is able to outcompete wild-type PD1 receptors on T cells. The decoy protein can both strongly bind the ligand of PD1 and block the interaction of PD1 and its ligand in an in-vitro assay. I am currently working on improving the LAG3 portion of the decoy protein and considering other pathways as possible targets. A Dedicated Neuronal Population Responsible for Sex-Independent Alloparental Behavior Dylan Rhodes, Neural Science Sponsor(s): Patrick O'Neill, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Neuroscience and Pathology Collegiate Research Scholar Aggression, defense, mating, and parenting are ubiquitous behaviors found across the animal kingdom, and the neural mechanisms that mediate such behaviors are highly conserved across species. In particular, allopa- rental behavior, or parental care given to non-biological offspring, has been well documented in various mamma- lian species. In mice, this phenomenon has been described in females, but whether males can exhibit alloparental behavior has been unknown. Here, we report that a pop- ulation of neurons in the medial preoptic area (MPOA), express the calcitonin receptor (CalcR), may pro-101vide a neural substrate for alloparental behavior in male mice. Our preliminary data indicate that optogenetic stimulation of the GABAergic subpopulation of CalcR+ MPOA neurons can promote parental behaviors, includ- ing pup retrieval and grooming, in otherwise nonparental male mice. In contrast, stimulation of the combination of glutamatergic and GABAergic CalcR+ MPOA neurons fails to induce parental behaviors. These results suggest that a dedicated population of neurons can induce paren- tal behaviors, and may provide a mechanism for allopar - enting, independent of sex. Understanding how complex behaviors, such as parenting, are instantiated by neural circuits is a fundamental goal of neuroscience, and pro- vides an opportunity to study the biological basis for how these behaviors may be dysregulated in neuropsychiatric disorders - particularly those with social impairments. Furthermore, it provides additional context to caregiving behavior that may inform later research endeavors also pursued by developmental and social psychologists. Uncovering the Spatial and Temporal Role of Innexins in the Development of the Visual System of Drosophila Karlee Rowland-Paz, Biology Sponsor(s): Dr. Ben Choi, Biology; Professor Claude Desplan, Biology Collegiate Research Scholar Characterizing the mechanisms by which devel- oping cells communicate with each other is important to understanding brain development. One such component is gap junction channels that mediate intercellular com- munication through passive and active diffusion of small molecules such as metabolites and ions. In D. melanogas- ter, these channels are formed by the oligomerization of innexin proteins encoded by eight innexin genes (inx). Although gap junctions are fundamental to general cell physiology, they are not well understood, partially due to the lack of accessible genetic models. Thus, using new- ly generated CRISPR mediated reporter knock-in trans- genic of inxs, the specific objective of this project is to determine the spatial and temporal expression patterns of innexins systematically in the developing Drosophila vi- sual system. Preliminary results confirm that inx1, inx2, inx3, and inx8 are robustly expressed in the visual system. Quantifying confocal images from transcriptional report- ers of inxs, we expect to determine a systematic expres- sion of innexins with single cell resolution during devel- opment which will provide groundwork for future studies and potentially give insight to the function of gap-junction channels in mammals.Application of BadNets in Spam Filters Swagnik Roychoudhury, Computer Science, Computer Engineering and Computer Engineering; Akshaj Kumar Veldanda, Electrical and Computer Engineering Spam filters play a crucial role in protecting email users from unwanted and potentially harmful messages. However, the effectiveness of these filters relies heavily on the quality of the machine learning models that power them. This paper focuses on designing backdoor attacks within the domain of spam filtering to demonstrate poten- tial vulnerabilities in the machine learning model supply chain. Our findings emphasize the need for careful consid- eration and evaluation of the models used in spam filters to ensure optimal performance. Our results indicate that backdoor attacks can effectively identify vulnerabilities in spam filters, highlighting the need for ongoing moni- toring and improvement in this area. The potential con- sequences of compromised spam filters can be severe, as they can lead to the proliferation of malicious emails and cybersecurity threats. Therefore, it is critical to address these issues to maintain the integrity of email systems and ensure the protection of users' personal information. This paper sheds light on the importance of continued research and development in spam filter security to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats. Can Artificial Intelligence Help Flag Fake News? Towards an Experimental Predictive Analytics Tool to Help Detect Misinformation in News Articles Sana Sajjad, Economics, Mathematics Sponsor(s): Professor Anasse Bari, Computer Science Collegiate Research Scholar Let's begin with a devastating fact about our mod- ern society: we are constantly surrounded by fake news. It engulfs us and informs our everyday decisions. Based on the news we receive, we choose who to vote for, what products to purchase, and how we treat other people. De- ceitful information reaches us through several mediums, such as news articles, images, and videos. Unfortunately, given the dire effects of fake news, there has been little effort to limit it. How do we define \"fake news\"? Depend- ing on who you ask, it can mean very different things. For the purposes of this research, we will define fake news to be misinformation that steers individuals toward harm- ful biases, thus a deliberate act for personal gain. My re- search, taking a specific subject, will seek to verify news. Conventionally, how do we check for fake news? We take the information to a fact-checker - a human being. The fact-checker, given time and money, will reach a conclu- sion. My ambition is to encourage the spread of truthful news free of cost to those who seek it. This can be done by studying and developing a fact-check algorithm. Min-102imizing human reliance, this algorithm takes in an online article and based on several parameters concludes on its authenticity. The machine learning tool would learn from historical examples of fake news and look into an arti- cle's URL, authors, citations, stylometry, and factors that typically constitute fake news. The implications of my re- search, aside from the spread of truthfulness, would be the production of high-class research since information will be run through a strict checking simulation. Influence of Neurotoxic, Reactive Astrocyte State on Neuronal Protein Synthesis Science Sponsor(s): Professor Eric Klann, Neural Science; Wendy Liu, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Neuroscience and Physiology Samuel E.Q. Ashley Research Scholar A hallmark trait of memory loss diseases is the formation of protein aggregates in the brain that lead to the loss of memory function, yet many other molecular factors contribute to deteriorating brain function. Previ- ous research has shown that neuronal protein synthesis is essential for memory formation. Additionally, support from astrocytes at synaptic junctions is key for synaptic plasticity and neuronal function. Recently, a specific type of inflammatory astrocyte has been seen to degrade the synaptic function of neurons and ultimately kill neurons: this state is called the neurotoxic reactive astrocytic state, and it is often induced by memory loss disease or traumat- ic brain injury. While the role of neuronal protein synthe- sis in synaptic plasticity and memory formation has been widely studied, little is known about the involvement of other cell types. This study aims to investigate the influ- ence of the neurotoxic astrocyte state on neuronal protein synthesis to answer the larger question of whether or not astrocyte translation influences neuronal translation. Our preliminary findings suggest that while the neurotoxic as- trocyte state has no influence on levels of global astrocyte translation, it does lead to decreased translation in neurons. This study suggests a relationship between translation in astrocytes and in neurons that influences synaptic plastici- ty and memory function, providing a potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative disease treatments. A Solar Powered Immersive Pollutant Filter for Bodies of Water Niouma Semega, Global Public Health, Sociology Sponsor(s): Brittany Edgehill, College of Global Public Health Collegiate Research Scholar Water pollution is one of the most dangerous en- vironmental risks resulting in negative health outcomes worldwide. Although there are interventions to reduce pollutants from entering waterways, there aren't solu- tions to remove pollution when the damage is already done. The purpose of this project is to create a device that will extract harmful pollutants from bodies of water us- ing an immersive two-step filtration system. It's been re- ported that more than 600,000 children in the U.S. alone are born with mercury blood levels at high measure- ments linked to low IQs and birth defects (Ocean Health Index 2018). Nitrate contamination has been increasing exponentially, in three states, 60% of the communities have elevated levels. Excessive nitrate compounds have been linked to carcinogens that evoke cancer risk and respiratory problems. According to the data collected from test strips, the mercury decreased by 100%. The test strips indicated that, before filtering the ocean water, the water was contaminated by 0.005ppm. According to the test strip, the maximum US EPA contaminant level is 0.002ppm. The nitrate test strips, indicated the max- imum level on the chart is 160 ppm. Before testing the ocean water it was 20 out of 160 ppm, which is also over the limit for the rules and regulation of nitrate contam- ination. After filtering the ocean water, it decreased to 5.0ppm. This means that the nitrate was initially 12.5% and decreased to 3.125%, therefore, the percent decrease is 9.375%. 103Clinician-Facing Endometriosis Screening Survey Vaishali Shah, Biology Sponsor(s): Dr. Kathy Huang, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Obstetrics and Gynecology Lydia R. Reeve Research Scholar Endometriosis is a benign gynecologic disorder that causes endometrial tissue, the tissue that normally lines the uterus, to grow outside of the uterus1-5 [32099483, 29276652, 15541453, 33132854, genital and extragenital. Ex- tragenital endometriosis can spread to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, causing symptoms characteristic of GI diseases such as functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDS) 6-10 [14419249, 6496859, 32012984, 29396128, 23583209]. There is significant overlap between the symptoms of GI endometriosis and functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDS), such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which are treated by gastroenterologists (GEs) 11 [21868492]. FGIDS use the \"Rome criteria;\" diagnoses are made based on symptom presentation, without definitive pathological findings from imaging or endoscopy12 [25136255]. Un- like FGIDS, gastrointestinal endometriosis can be iden- tified with imaging. Further, there are medical and sur - gical treatment options are available 7, 13-16 [6496859, 32653334, 31728612, 29202963, 32972838]. Due to the variable symptom presentation for endometriosis, as well as its overlap with gastrointestinal disorders, patients of- ten experience symptoms for 8-12 years before diagnosis. ^39 [30905186]. While gastrointestinal endometriosis is a gynecologic condition, gastroenterologists (GEs) may be uniquely positioned to screen women with gastrointesti- nal distress symptoms for gastrointestinal endometriosis 40 [35135662]. Early identification, diagnosis, and refer - ral to gynecologic care may help close this time-to-diag- nosis gap, reduce underdiagnosis of endometriosis, and prevent misdiagnosis of gastrointestinal endometriosis as an FGID ^17 [26450609]. The objective of this study is to gauge preparedness among gastroenterologists to screen for gastrointestinal endometriosis by asking: to what de- gree are gastroenterologists prepared, comfortable, and motivated to investigate GI endometriosis as a cause of gastrointestinal symptoms in women? The Electrochemical Conversion of Propionic Acid to Ethylene Joyce Shin, Chemistry, Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering; Carolina Elizarraras, Chemistry, Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering Miguel Modestino, Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering; Andrea Angulo, Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering Collegiate Research Scholar Ethylene production is the chemical with the high- est global annual production volume and contributes 126 MMT of CO2 emissions per year. Currently, the most common method of production is through steam-crack- ing, a highly energy intensive process. An alternative production pathway is the electrochemical oxidation of aqueous waste from a hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) process after stream via non-Kolbe electrolysis. This stream is rich in carboxylic acids, one of which is propi- onic acid. For a comprehensive understanding of the op- erating conditions that favor the conversion of carboxylic acids, we conducted a systematic study to further explore the electrochemical conversion of propionic acid into eth- ylene and other products using a batch reactor. The effects of initial substrate concentration, operational current den- sity, and initial electrolyte pH on the ethylene production were investigated. In conclusion, a set of conditions that yielded faradaic efficiencies towards ethylene above 50% were identified. Identification of Novel Neuronal Cell-types through Single-cell RNA-sequencing-guided Split-GAL4 Lines in Shoji, Global Public Health, Biology Sponsor(s): Professor Claude Desplan, Biology Max and Cecil (Steuer) Chesin Research Scholarship in the Life Sciences Winner of Phi Beta Kappa Albert Borgman Prize for Best Honors Thesis in STEM Neuronal diversity is an essential feature of ner - vous systems across species. The developmental mecha- nisms underlying neuronal diversity have been extensive- ly investigated in the Drosophila visual system, given its numeric simplicity compared to its mammalian counter - parts as well as the availability of sophisticated genetic tools. Although there are existing genetic tools for study- ing the functional roles of individual cell-types, there is a lack of cell-type specific tools for most of the cell-types in the Drosophila visual system. Here, we aimed to make use of both existing data and genetic tools to create a new method for systematically generating cell-type specific tools. Utilizing published single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, we predicted that we could identify two genes whose expression patterns only overlap in a single cell-type. Such gene pairs could then be used to generate gene-specific split-GAL4 fly lines to drive re- porter expression exclusively in the single type of neuron which co-expresses the two target genes. In silico analy- sis identified selective gene pairs for all cell-types in the dataset, including unannotated cell-types whose formal identity was unknown. We generated split-GAL4 driver fly lines to verify the in vivo efficacy of this method and identified two unknown clusters from the dataset, includ- ing one novel visual projection neuronal cell-type which we named Medulla Superior Posterior Slope (MeSps). The success of our split-GAL4 lines to selectively target 104a predicted cell-type provides proof-of-principle for our scRNA-seq-guided split-GAL4 design. Additionally, this method opens up the possibility of annotating every cell- type in the optic lobe dataset and provides tools for the study of any novel identified cell-types. These split-GAL4 lines can be utilized by Drosophila optic lobe researchers for many downstream experimental applications, and this tool generation method could be applied to other systems or organisms to facilitate future research. Analyzing the Effect of Ion Strength on Micelle Formations in Soluplus\u00ae using Dynamic Light Scattering Nadine Simprevil, Chemistry Sponsor(s): Professor Surita Bhatia, SUNY Stony Brook, Chemistry; Mitchell Kennedy, SUNY Stony Brook, Chemistry Hydrogels are highly absorbent polymers that have several biomedical applications, such as the enhancement of drug delivery systems, wound dressings, etc. Specifi- cally, amphiphilic block copolymers are materials which contain multiple distinct blocks of varying hydropho- bicity1. Soluplus\u00ae is an example of a graft copolymer, which will be used to understand these applications. They form micelles at very low concentrations in water at room temperature and form gels at higher concentrations. It has been recently studied due to its ability to solubilize hydro- phobic and poorly soluble drugs and become more viscous close to room temperature. Previous research has studied the rheological and structural properties of Soluplus\u00ae in the solid phase. In this project, we will be looking at it more closely in the aqueous and gel form and studying these micelles they form closely. In this study, Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) was used to analyze the effects of inorganic salts (KCl and NaCl) on the sizes of the micelles found in Soluplus\u00ae and their aggregation behavior. It was also used to analyze how the increase in temperature and concentration of the salts and Soluplus\u00ae affects the size of these micelles and the structure of Soluplus\u00ae. It was found that this increase in ion concentration and tempera- ture affects the micelle sizes and the aggregation behavior causing it to aggregate at lower temperatures. Optimizing Intra-Process Communication Performance while Maintaining Security in the Lind Single-Process Sandbox Jonathan Singer, Computer Science, Mathematics Sponsor(s): Professor Justin Cappos, Computer Science Collegiate Research Scholar The eventual goal of the Lind project is to create a software sandbox, a program that allows other potential- ly malicious or buggy programs to run within it without allowing them to harm anything. Lind runs many \"un- trusted\" programs in a single process, whereas all existing generalized sandboxes have a sandbox process for each program they run. Lind provides software fault isolation, which prevents an untrusted program from accessing memory not assigned to it (Native Client Yee, Bennet et. al 2009). Lind also has a popular paths implementation of a POSIX (Linux/MacOS like) kernel, meaning that all kernel code (code at the core of the operating system) accessed by Lind is run frequently (hence popular), and therefore has fewer vulnerabilities (Lock-in-Pop Li, Yiw- en et. al 2017). Much of this work has already been done by others. My contribution to Lind has involved several things, including: contributing to adding new kernel em- ulation functionality, particularly in networking, so as to generalize the applicability of the sandbox, proving the current infeasibility of using \"zero-copy\" approaches such as Copy-on-Write within a single process on modern operating systems, spearheading the rewrite of our kernel emulation, and creating a formal justification for the se- curity of that rewrite. My contributions have enabled us to run a web server within our sandbox and thus prove the viability of our approach and thus contextualize the performance improvements that come from using Lind. Using Computer Vision to Track Coherent Vortices in Fusion Plasma Turbulence Tanuj Sistla, Computer Science, Mathematics Sponsor(s): Professor Norman Cao, Mathematics Magnetic fusion energy (MFE) is a promising av- enue to sustainable energy, as it could help de-carbonize the energy grid. However, the need to understand trans- port of heat and particles in the complex and turbulent environment of MFE devices like tokamaks is a major challenge to creating self-sustaining fusion reactors. To best optimize performance from these tokamaks, the turbulent convective exchange of particles must be con- trolled between the hot, pure plasma confined in the core of the device with the cool, impure plasma in contact with the device walls. This requires interpreting how plasma flows within the tokamaks, which includes turbulent flows forming \"blobs\" or \"filaments'' within them. We study the extraction of such structures from numerical simulations of the Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) equations, which is a model for plasma turbulence in tokamaks. Performing this extraction by hand on the large datasets generated by these simulations is impractical, so we examine automation through computer vision methods like edge detection and sparse optical flow. Edge detection detects boundaries in an image or video, while optical flow tracks the apparent motion of an object between frames. We find that some methods, such as Lucas-Kanade, have been successful in tracking vortices in the plasma flow. Results vary depend- ing on how data is mapped to the video format, including shifting the velocity of the frames relative to the observer.105Bypassing Sticky-Ends: Programming 3D DNA Crystals using Pi-Stacking Interactions Danie Sivertsen, Chemistry Sponsor(s): Professor Yoel Ohayon, Chemistry Collegiate Research Scholar The goal of this project was to develop a modifica- tion of the DNA tensional integrity triangle that allows the use of pi-stacking to program strands rather than sticky- ends. The whole field of Structural DNA Nanotechnology hinges on this method of sticky-end cohesion. 3D DNA crystals have always used sticky end cohesion to form, but now there is a possibility that this is not the only method. Therefore, this research explores the question of wheth- er or not sticky-end cohesion is the only way to program 3D DNA crystal strands. The goal of this research was to explore and show that blunt ends can also work just fine through pi-stacking. Pi-stacking is a well-known phenom- enon in which aromatic molecules (such as those found in DNA bases) can interact via Van der Waals forces to form stable, non-covalent interactions. This was done through testing out different blunted triangle edge lengths from 18 to 24. Additionally, I tested out different methods of pi-stacking to achieve the desired results. A Physiologically-compatible Paradigm for Acute Stress in OCAM Studies Hannah Jia Hsing Smith, Neural Science Sponsor(s): Professor Andre Fenton, Neural Science; Dr. Garrett Blair, Neural Science Collegiate Research Scholar Today's model of animal memory was established by 19th-century theorists of animal cognition and states that animals need a reminder to initiate memory recall. Conjuring one's own thoughts is the basis of cognition. While we cannot yet prove if animals have cognition, one condition has been demonstrated to trigger remote recall: acute stress. Previous research has shown that stress itself reactivates memories even in a context unrelated to the original stressor; forced swim stress one day after learning enhanced memory recall (Jezek, Lee et al., 2010). What mechanism in the brain is responsible for stress-induced out-of-context activation of memory (OCAM)? Unfortu- nately, forced swim stress is not conducive to electrophys- iological recording as water will damage any recording equipment mounted to the animals' heads. Here, we pave the way for future neuronal recording studies by finding a stressor e.g., unstable platform stress, that both produces OCAM and is electrophysiologically compatible. Initial investigation has demonstrated that animals placed on an unstable elevated platform experienced a significant stress response, shown by increased plasma corticosterone com- pared to control animals on a stable platform. Further - more, compared to the stable platform controls, the unsta-ble platform enhanced the expression of an active place avoidance memory acquired the day before. The Interaction of Spatial and Temporal Gene Regulatory Programs in Drosophila Neural Development Mennah Claude Desplan, Biology Shirley Schmones Wallach Research Scholar Cascades of transcription factors (TF) in neural stem cells are responsible for generating the enormous diversity of cell types in nervous systems, from flies to mammals. Unique combinations of relatively few \"ter - minal selector\" TFs that are stably expressed throughout development and adulthood then maintain all type-spe- cific differential gene expression in postmitotic neurons. However, it remains unclear how this stable identity code interacts with various external signals at different stages to generate temporally specific gene expression profiles. Here, we show that ecdysone-responsive TFs interact with the terminal selectors to dictate spatiotemporal gene ex- pression profiles during brain wiring. Focusing on Trans- medullary (Tm) neurons in the Drosophila optic lobe, the stable expression of the selector pdm3 maintains Tm2 neuronal identity while aop serves a similar function for Tm4 neurons. We utilized the Inferelator 3.0 framework to generate gene regulatory networks (GRNs) inferring genetic interactions, which we validated experimentally. We found that the ecdysone-responsive TF Hr3 indirect- ly stage (P50) in Tm2 by repressing Blimp-1 expression itself, a repressor of Mef2.These results describe how a stably maintained code of identity TFs can nevertheless encode dynamic gene expression patterns in postmitot- ic neurons through combinatorial regulation of effector genes. Fluid Biomarkers and the PBMC Transcriptome in a Non-human Primate Model of Sporadic CAA Muhammad Soliman, Global Public Health, Biology Sponsor(s): Professor Henrieta Scholtzova, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Neurology Herman Berkman Undergraduate Research Scholar Intro: Innate immunomodulation presents a prom- ising avenue for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) neuropathology, and translational models of spo- radic AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) are imperative to testing therapeutics. This project serves to assess age related changes in AD pathology and the effica- cy of innate immunity stimulation via Class C CpG-ODN by evaluating fluid biomarkers and the PBMC transcrip- tome in a unique non-human primate model of sporadic CAA. Methods: Geriatric squirrel monkeys (SQMs) re-106ceived injections of Class longitudinally using Luminex, Simoa, or ELISA assays. RNA-Seq was performed for genome-wide analysis of PBMCs isolated from SQMs prior to (0hr) and 24hr after the 6th and 29th CpG injections. Results: Plasma levels of NfL, GFAP, and YKL-40 were significantly increased across age groups and in saline-administered monkeys compared to the CpG-treated cohort. Longitudinal plasma A40/42 IgG and IgM titers revealed no differences between treatment groups, further validating the safety of our immunomod- ulatory approach. QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analy- sis (IPA) software was used to identify significant alter - ations in 13 Canonical Pathways 24hr after the 6th and 29th injections, as well as in 67 Disease and Biological Function Pathways. Significantly upregulated Canonical Pathways included immune cell related gene sets such as toll like receptor, NAD signaling, and interferon sig- naling pathways. Further fluid biomarker and RNA-Seq genome-wide transcriptome are underway. Con- clusion: Our findings enhance the translational value of the SQM model for preclinical research on aging, AD, and CAA pathogenesis, as we demonstrate CpG ODN's safety and therapeutic efficacy in geriatric SQMs. Elucidating the Role Chromatin Remodeling Complexes Play in Neuro-developmental Disorders Yvette Somersel, Biology Sponsor(s): Sarah Williams, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Neuroscience Collegiate Research Scholar The diagnosis of Neuro-developmental disorders is becoming more prevalent, yet the mechanistic basis of most disorders remains unknown. Recent studies have begun to identify genes associated with Neuro-develop- mental disorders. GWAS studies have identified genes en- coding subunits of the BAF complex, such as \"ARID1B\" and \"ARID1A,\" which are significantly associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and other Neuro-devel- opmental disorders (Greenberg, 2021). BAF, an ATP-de- pendent chromatin remodeling complex, is crucial in di- recting the regulation of gene expression in mammalian cells (Vierbuchen et al., 2017). ARID1B, a subunit of the BAF complex, is a member of the ARID DNA-binding protein family. Recent findings have identified ARID1B as a mediator of not only chromatin remodeling activi- ties but stimulus-responsive gene expression programs (Greenberg, 2021). These gene expression programs are homeostatically regulated by the balance of excitation and inhibition (E/I) stimuli, and perturbation of this balance is heavily implicated in ASD etiology (Culotta and Penzes, 2020). The two cell types most implicated in ASD are (E/I) neurons, both of which can be generated reproducibly \"in vitro\" from human pluripotent stem cells in contrast to previously used mouse models (Lee and Fields, 2021). To investigate the role that ARID1B plays in ASD, we em- ploy the PiggyBac neu- rons (Ho et al., 2016). This system allowed us to map the effects wild-type (WT) and chemically degraded ARID1B have on the regulation of (E/I) networks and subsequent production of activity-dependent gene responses through qPCR (Culotta and Penzes, 2020). These studies suggest future directions for ASD therapies, revealing specific BAF complex proteins to be targeted. Heat-Responsive Organic Semiconductor/Polymer Blends for Optoelectronics Pallavi Sundaram, Chemistry Sponsor(s): Professor Stephanie Lee, Chemistry Dr. Milton Goldstein, D.D.S., Research Scholar, Drs. Aaron A. and Francine M. Stein Family Research Scholar, Nathan Ende Research Scholar A major challenge facing the commercialization of organic semiconductors for optoelectronic devices is growing high-quality and large crystalline domains during rapid film processing. Here, we form arrays of triisopropylsilylethynyl anthradithiophene (TIPS ADT) single crystals with size in the hundreds of microns range. Blends of TIPS ADT and polyethylene (PE) powder were melted and rapidly cooled as thin films. During cooling, TIPS ADT and PE crystallized as intertwined banded spherulites, wherein crystalline lamellae twist jointly as they grow radially outwards from the spherulite center. X-ray diffraction experiments revealed that the TIPS ADT crystals adopt a previously unreported metastable poly- morph. Hence, when these films were thermally annealed at 100oC, the PE melting point, large platelike crystals nu- cleated and grew fastest along the radial direction. X-ray diffraction and absorption spectroscopy measurements confirmed that these platelike crystals adopt the thermody- namically stable polymorph observed in solution-grown single crystals. The rate of the recrystallization process and new crystal growth was measured via time-resolved optical microscopy and was found to depend on the mor - phology of the banded spherulites. Notably, the average crystal size achieved in this rapid crystallization and ther - mal annealing process is significantly larger than that ob- tained via spin coating. Consequently, this method holds promise for controlling the size and orientation of organic semiconductor crystals in the active layers of optoelec- tronic devices such as organic LEDs and photovoltaics.107Leukocyte Telomere Length Significantly Reduced in Women after Ovarian Stimulation during Their First IVF Treatment Angela Talusan, Biology Sponsor(s): Dr. Fang Wang, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Obstetrics and Gynecology; Dr. David Keefe, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Obstetrics and Gynecology To prepare for in vitro fertilization (IVF) or oocyte freezing (OOF), women undergo ovarian stimulation (OS) to promote the maturation and release of eggs from ovar - ian follicles. During this process, estrogen serum levels can increase up to 100x. It has been suggested that estro- gen has a lengthening effect on telomeres by both prevent- ing telomere attrition and activating telomerase (Lee et al., 2005). This study examines whether leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is affected following OS. Blood clot samples were collected from 60 women both before and after OS (median time=11 days) preceding either IVF (n=35) or OOF (n=25) treatment. Genomic DNA was extracted, and LTL was measured by qPCR. Analysis by paired sample t-test indicated extremely significant shortening of LTL following OS (p=0.002). LTL shortening was associated with maternal age (p=0.021), but not with the amount of change in serum estrogen levels; however, this does not negate that estrogen overexpression may play a role in the observed telomere shortening. Separate analyses of IVF and OOF patients indicated significant LTL shortening in IVF patients (p=0.01), but not in OOF patients. Maternal age and stress are likely contributors to this observation, as IVF patients were older than OOF patients (p=0.043), and women undergoing IVF treatment are likely under more emotional stress than those undergoing OOF. We conclude transient LTL shortening in women following OS - this has important implications given what is known about telomere shortening and disease incidence. Future studies should analyze long-term effects of OS and the role of stress on LTL. Efficient Algorithm for Stylized Animation using Freeform Vector Graphics with Controlled Non- Uniform Rational B-Spline Curves Maosen Tang, Mathematics Sponsor(s): Dr. Samuel Potter, Mathematics Collegiate Research Scholar In this research, we present an efficient algorithm for creating stylized animations using freeform vector graphics with controlled non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) curves. Our primary objective is to reduce the computational cost of the animation while maintain- ing a reasonable level of accuracy. To achieve this, we developed a graphic user-interface (GUI) using Python that allows for easy manipulation of the NURBS curve by adding, deleting, and moving control points. The GUI also enables point selection on the curve with spacing in- versely proportional to the curvature, which facilitates the solution of the Laplace equation on the domain encircled by the curve. We use the position and RGB value of these points as boundary conditions to construct the images.In addition, we conducted a thorough examination of exist- ing methods for solving the Laplace equation, including the boundary integral equation method, finite element method, and finite difference method. We implemented these methods to determine their run-time and accuracy, contributing to our overall understanding of the project's feasibility and success. Our approach is more efficient than traditional methods, as it reuses data generated from previous frames to construct succeeding frames, signifi- cantly reducing the computational cost.Our algorithm has several potential applications, including computer graph- ics, film, and video game development. We believe that our research has significant implications for the field of stylized animation, as it makes it more accessible and practical for a wider range of applications. NLP Analysis of Word Choice in Reports of Domestic Terrorism Kurt Tio, Chemistry Sponsor(s): Professor Anasse Bari, Computer Science Collegiate Research Scholar Racism in America has existed for as long as the country has. Racially-based bias is woven within the very threads of our culture in America, and has made its way even into the way we report news. This perpetuates that same racism, the path to elimination of which begins with awareness of its existence. This study focused on using natural language processing (NLP) to correlate the senti- ments of different news outlets' reports of mass shootings with the races and ethnicities of the perpetrators. The total sentiments of the articles was found using the standard sentiment analysis (SA) tool from the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), with added pertinent words and scores close to existing correlated words in the library. Among all races and ethnicities studied (White, Asian, Middle Eastern, Black, and Hispanic), no significant difference (p > 0.05) was found in the sentiment of the sentences used to describe the perpetrators. However, different key- words used to describe perpetrators were identified and presented. Rational Design of an E6 Mimic to Target E6AP Eugene Toth, Chemistry Sponsor(s): Professor Paramjit Arora, Chemistry; Joey Ongkingco, Chemistry Collegiate Research Scholar Cervical cancer is the third most prevalent cancer worldwide, with over 600,000 new cases recorded an- nually and is primarily caused by the oncogenic human 108papillomavirus (HPV). During the course of viral repli- cation, the viral oncoprotein E6 participates in various protein-protein interactions (PPIs) which disrupt cellular processes and machinery. In particular, E6 recruits a na- tive protein E6AP by binding to a helix on E6AP, which introduces a conformational shift in E6 to create a bind- ing pocket for p53, a tumor suppressor protein. E6AP is then thought to mark p53 for cellular degradation, which in turn disrupts cellular defense mechanisms meant to pre- vent the growth of tumors. Our work attempts to inhibit this interaction through rational design of a peptide mim- ic of E6AP which binds to E6. Targeting this interaction required understanding which residues in the protein's sequence contributed to the binding event. To do this, we computationally mutated each residue to alanine and calculated the change in free energy, identifying residues which introduced large changes as pertinent interactions which should be conserved. Previous work has identified an LXXLL alpha-helix as being critical to this binding event, which has directed our attempts to develop an in- hibitor of this interaction. Our lab has developed various methods of targeting PPIs. In particular, we've developed methods of mimicking alpha-helices through a hydrogen bond surrogate which covalently nucleates the hydrogen bonding pattern found in alpha-helices and stabilizes the structure of the peptide. Using this approach, we are ex- ploring how to optimize binding to E6 to develop a ther -apeutic strategy which disrupts HPV's mechanisms of targeting cellular processes. Modeling Wetland Soil Carbon Levels with Hyperspectral Imagery Kimberly Union, Environmental Studies Sponsor(s): Professor Charles Bachmann, Rochester Institute of Technology, Center for Imaging Science Joseph Gilbride Research Scholar Wetlands store carbon at levels vital to global bio- geochemical cycles, but the amount of carbon they store can be difficult to measure, especially in hard to reach or large areas. With hyperspectral data acquired by UAS (Unmanned Aerial System) flights over wetlands, and soil samples and their carbon content, this study attempts to measure the relationship between hyperspectral measure- ments of soil and actual carbon storage. This presentation will use data from Hog Island in the Virginia Coast Re- serve. It will use an NDVI vegetation index on the drone imaging platform ENVI to isolate soil from aerial samples, extract the reflectance, and compare average reflectance of each sample at different wavelengths with soil carbon in order to determine if there is a correlation between the two. This would allow for soil carbon measurements in inaccessible areas, and deepen the understanding of how wetlands contribute to global carbon cycling. 109The Modifications in the Infant Rat Hippocampus by the Mother Alejandra Urquieta, Neural Science Sponsor(s): Professor Regina Sullivan, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Collegiate Research Scholar Previous research showed that parents can sup- press fear in their children. If the parent is present during a threat, there is suppression of the child's amygdala, a brain area critical for the expression of fear. Furthermore, work on rats has shown that amygdala suppression is causal for fear suppression. Maltreatment, however, dis- rupts parental buffering of infant fear and amygdala activ- ity. This is applied in rats through the Scarcity Adversity model of low bedding as the lack of resources (material for nest) increases behaviors associated with harsh mater - nal care such as stepping on the pups and dragging them through the cage. Here we investigate another area, the hippocampus, which is incorporated into the fear circuit with development, responding to threats and modulating the amygdala activity. We hypothesize that when the hip- pocampus is integrated into the threat system, parental presence will also buffer it. Furthermore, we hypothesize that parental maltreatment will dismiss this effect. From postnatal day (PN)8 to PN12 pups were Scarcity Adversity condition). PN18 and PN28 pups were exposed to threat (mild tail-shock) with or without the mother and 2-DG hippocampal activ- ity was assessed. PN18 hippocampus was not responsive to social buffering of threat but was engaged following maltreatment. The opposite was seen for PN28 pups. A Cross Sectional Analysis of Anthropogenic Pollution along an Urban-Rural Gradient Ethan Vainrib, Environmental Studies Sponsor(s): Professor Mary Killilea, Environmental Studies Collegiate Research Scholar Urban-rural gradients, as urbanization becomes more and more of a global trend, are becoming very crucial areas of study in Environmental Science. Under - standing urban-rural gradients is understanding how ur - banization is changing a given city's surrounding land- scape. New York City contains many gradients radiating out its center which function as opportunities to study specifically how urbanization has shifted the landscape of its rural and suburban surrounding areas. My study examines the urban-rural gradient along the South Shore of Long Island. The South Shore is composed of a long chain of rarely-interrupted barrier islands. The shore runs from Coney Island in Brooklyn to Montauk at the eastern end of Long Island. The amount of plastic contamination (plastic pieces, >5mm in length) contamination, micro- plastic contamination (plastic pieces, <5mm in length) , and heavy metal contamination will be assessed along the South Shore coast, from samples collected from 26 sites. These three factors are indicators of anthropogenic pollution, and, when mapped, can paint a clear picture of how urbanization is behind pollution on the South Shore. Many cities are built near barrier islands, such as Miami and Houston, so the results of the study can indicate pat- terns in those cities as well. Analyzing the Dynamics of MHV68 Uracil-DNA- Glycosylase In Vitro and Dr. Somnath Paul, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis Collegiate Research Scholar Epstein Barr virus and Kaposi sarcoma are both human gamma herpes viruses that target B cell germinal centers in lymphoid tissues. Each of these viruses is de- fined by lifelong infections and oncogenic properties. Part of its ability to infect for life is the lytic and latent phases the virus undergoes. The lytic phase of these viruses is de- fined by mass replication, while the latent phase, in which the infection spends much of the time, is composed of lit- tle to no replication except for sporadic lytic outbursts. Recently, a closely related KSHV homolog was found in rodents called murine herpes virus 68 (MHV68) which makes it an acceptable model for studying the dynamics of these related viruses in mice. MHV68 expresses its own distinct Uracil-DNA-Glycosylase (vUNG/ORF46) that helps prevent the misincorporation of uracil into its DNA. Previous research implicated that vUNG is essen- tial for the virus to establish latency in germinal centers (1). However, the interactome and dynamics of expres- sion for this critical gene are still not clear. Studies have determined that the lytic phase for MHV68 peaks at 14- 16 days post-infection in vivo (2). We utilized a plethora of experimental approaches to determine the detectable timeline for ORF46 expression. This preliminary data will help future work on understanding the interactome and dynamics of vUNG/ORF46 during different phases of infection for these classes of viruses. Effects of AC Stimulation on the Cerebellum Sai Vendidandi, Neural Science Sponsor(s): Professor Eric Lang, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Neuroscience and Physiology Collegiate Research Scholar The main purpose of the project is to be able to better understand how transcranial alternating current (AC) stimulation can be used for modulating the cerebel- lar activity. Electrical stimulation of the cerebellum is a long-standing and promising but understudied therapeutic modality. Still, some questions need to be answered for electrical stimulation to reach its potential as a therapeu-110tic tool. For example, the way it alters cerebellar activity is still not known. So to better understand how electrical stimulation affects the cerebellum we will look at how Purkinje cells are modulated in relation to AC stimulation and use that information to test possible models of current flow through the cerebellum and to find optimal parame- ters of AC stimulation for treating different cognitive and motor disorders. Investigating the Functional Role and Molecular Identity of Foxp2+ Cells in the Bed Nucleus of the Vilnaigre, Neural Science Grossman School of Medicine, Neuroscience and Physiology Collegiate Research Scholar Social behaviors, such as aggression and mating, are essential for survival across several species. Aggres- sion is utilized for securing resources and mating ensures the propagation of offspring. There have been several brain regions identified for social behaviors, including the medial amygdala (MeA) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). In previous studies, GABAergic cells within the MeA have been implicated in social be- haviors. Research within our lab has found that Foxp2+ cells, which comprises 10% of total MeA cells, are acti- vated in response to male conspecifics and are function- ally relevant for territorial aggression in male mice. Al- though MeA Foxp2+ cells are implicated in aggression, further research must be done to determine if this function is preserved across other brain regions involved in social behaviors. Earlier work has also implicated the principal component of the BNST in social behaviors and sex rec- ognition in male mice. Since MeAFoxp2 cells are suffi- cient to generate territorial aggression in male mice, we hypothesize that like in the MeA, Foxp2+ cells will in- voke territorial aggression in the BNST. To prove this, we performed behavioral assays to investigate the functional role of Foxp2+ cells within the BNST. We utilized che- mogenetic tools to artificially activate BNST Foxp2+ cells in male mice and recorded aggressive encounters during a territorial aggression assay. Additionally, we performed immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy to inves- tigate if, like the MeA, Foxp2+ cells are primarily GAB- Aergic. Preliminary data show that there is more overlap between GABAergic cells and Foxp2+ cells than gluta- matergic and Foxp2+ cells, which suggest that the BNST Foxp2+ cells are inhibitory. By studying BNSTFoxp2 cells we can determine if a transcriptionally defined sub- population govern aggression in mice across regions. Our findings will provide the foundation for potential treat- ments of disorders where aggression is prevalent, such as schizophrenia or dissociative identity disorder.Decoding the Electroencephalography Signals of Chronic Pains by Machine Learning Austin Wang, Computer Science, Neural Science Sponsor(s): Professor Zhe Chen, Neuroscience and Physiology Collegiate Research Scholar Chronic pain affects millions of individuals world- wide, but its underlying mechanisms remain poorly un- derstood. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals have been proposed as a non-invasive and objective tool for in- vestigating the pathophysiology of chronic pain. Machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing complex data sets, including EEG sig- nals. In this study, we aimed to investigate the feasibility of using ML techniques to analyze EEG data from a pub- lic dataset of chronic pain patients and healthy controls. The dataset we used in this study included 101 chronic pain patients and 84 healthy controls. We preprocessed the EEG data and applied a variety of ML algorithms, including random forests, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks, to classify the EEG signals of the two groups. Our results demonstrate that ML algo- rithms can effectively distinguish between EEG signals of chronic pain patients and healthy controls with high accuracy. These findings have important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic pain. By provid- ing objective and accurate measures of chronic pain, ML techniques could improve patient outcomes and enable clinicians to make more informed decisions about patient care. Additionally, these findings may help to identify spe- cific brain regions and neural pathways that are involved in chronic pain, thereby providing important insights into the mechanisms of the condition. Evidence for Distinct Activity Patterns at Different Cortical Regions during Fear Expression Isabela Weber, Neural Science Sponsor(s): Dr. Erez Geron, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Neuroscience and Physiology; Professor Bernardo Rudy, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Neuroscience and Physiology Collegiate Research Scholar Fear conditioning is an experimental paradigm used to study memory acquisition and expression. Un- derstanding the neurocircuitry that is recruited during fear learning and expression is important to understand common psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and PTSD. Previous studies have found that the activity of neurons in the primary motor cortex anti-correlates with freezing behavior during fear conditioning experiments. Whether and how fear conditioning affects synaptic connections and neuronal activities in other cortical areas of the brain is not fully clear. In the present study, we examined neu- ronal activity patterns in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) during recall tests of fear conditioning. We hypothesized that neurons in the RSC and S1 are recruited during fear learning and that these brain regions would show a significant change in cortical brain activity after learning. We trained mice with the fear conditioning paradigm and used two-photon microscopy to image somatic Ca2+ activity of neurons (L5 PNs) in the RSC and S1 during recall tests. Our results suggest the presence of distinct activity patterns in S1 and RSC neurons during recall of fear con- ditioning. By quantifying somatic activity of L5 PNs, we can better understand the neural circuitry that is involved in associative fear learning. A Novel Contrastive Topic Model for Detecting and Modeling Emerging Events on Twitter Andy Wei, Computer Science Sponsor(s): Professor Daniel Neill, Computer Science Swartz Family Research Scholar Twitter is currently one of the most popular social medias in the world. Many social activists use Twitter to attract attention for their movements and amplify the voice of the unheard. To better understand the move- ments, a novel contrastive topic model that can detect and summarize past and emerging events is proposed. The new topic model is a combination of biterm topic model and contrastive LDA model. The static LDA model is re- placed by biterm topic model, as biterm topic model has a better performance on short text data. The dataset used is all tweets that contain #StopAsianHate hashtag, a relevant social movement popular on twitter. Compared to simple contrastive LDA, a contrastive topic model that is widely used previously, the novel contrastive topic model is able to achieve better performance on twitter data, increasing the coherence score of the topic produced by 48%. Fur - thermore, it is able to detect events that, upon searching on the internet, correspond to events that are important in the community but not widely reported by the mainstream media. Overall, this new topic model is a great tool to use for detecting and modeling emerging events, and can be used by others to better understand similar movements on social media. Development and Application of a qPCR Method for Quantifying Telomeric DNA Hunter Whitbeck, Environmental Studies Sponsor(s): Dr. Bogdan Sieriebriennikov, Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology; Professor Claude Desplan, Biology Sorrell and Lorraine Chesin Research Scholarship in the Life Sciences Telomeres are repetitive segments of DNA which flank the ends of chromosomes. With each cell division, the telomeres lose a small amount of their genetic mate-rial and shrink in size. This aging dynamic helps to en- sure old cells die off as to avoid mutagenesis or cancer from an accumulation of DNA mutations. Many studies have been done in humans showing that telomere length decreases with age; additionally, it has been shown that telomere length differs from tissue to tissue in the same individual. Harpegnathos saltator is a promising new model organism to study aging due to their unique social system in which all individuals in a colony are genetically identical yet different social castes have vastly different lifespans. Being able to study their telomeres accurately and efficiently is a valuable tool to support the prediction that telomere shrinkage is a molecular cause of aging. This work adapts the widely accepted Cawthon Protocol of telomere quantification from the human genome to the H. saltator genome, which has a different telomeric repeat ((TTAGGG)n for human and (TTAGG)n for H. saltator). The adaptation of this protocol provides an assay which can be used on all insects which have the (TTAGG)n telo- mere pattern. The assay provides the opportunity to use H. saltator, or another insect of choice, as a model species to study and experiment on telomere length regulation, as well as study telomere length dynamics in insect popula- tions in the surrounding environment. Integrating Community Science and Passive Acoustic Monitoring to Investigate the Impact of Helicopter Noise Pollution on Bird Populations of Governors Island, NYC Leila Winn, Environmental Studies Sponsor(s): Professor Katie Schnieder-Paolantonio, Biology; Dr. Tae Hong Park, Music and Performing Arts Professions Collegiate Research Scholar Urban expansion results in habitat fragmentation (Hedbloom et al. 2019), placing greater strain on exist- ing green spaces (Chang 2017) and removing natural buf- fers of noise pollution (Wood et al. 2018). In the NYC area, Governors Island is a 172 acre green space in New York Harbor that serves as a natural stopover for migra- tory birds. Although there is little car traffic on the island, there is significant noise pollution resulting from aircrafts (mostly helicopters), which provides a unique opportunity to study the direct effects of helicopter noise pollution on birds, an area that is lacking in current research (Madden 2020). Of the 220 species of migratory and non-migratory birds found on GI (NYC Audubon), we monitored six tar - get bird species (3 migratory and 3 year-round species) at nine sites (representing low, medium and high helicopter noise) using a combination of established field methods and passive acoustic technology. In this study, we asked 1) How can we utilize community science to observe avian behavioral changes in response to helicopter noise? and 2) Can deep neural networks be used to expedite pattern 112recognition when analyzing audio data of birds and heli- copters? We recruited community scientists to aid in our observational data collection. After leading six, 20-minute online training sessions, the community science compo- nent resulted in 146 observations of the nine GI field sites entered through Arc123 surveys. Audiomoth sensors were placed at these sites and gathered over 237 hours of re- cordings. These files will be processed with the Seasound Tool (in Matlab) to rapidly extract helicopter, airplane, and bird call sounds to expedite the identification process. This program will also train a deep neural network using bird call data to rapidly analyze pitch and frequency of calls. Exploration of a Zinc-based Substitute for Silver Diamine Fluoride in the Treatment of Dental Caries Andrew Witty, Chemistry, Economics Sponsor(s): Professor Marc A Walters, Chemistry Collegiate Research Scholar The Walters Group at the NYU Molecular Design Institute (MDI) is developing a zinc-based alternative to silver diamine fluoride (SDF) in the treatment of dental caries, otherwise known as cavities. Currently, SDF is used to arrest the decay, but it leaves a black stain on the tooth (Mei et al, 2016). The stain results from the forma- tion of silver nanoparticle aggregates (Jornet-Martinez et al, 2019). The goal of this research project was to de- sign a solution that will deposit antimicrobial zinc oxide (ZnO) in an aqueous environment (similar conditions to a tooth), and occlude dentin tubules. A molar ratio of 1:7 zinc fluoride (ZnF2) to aqueous ammonia difluoride (Zn(N- H3)4F2). that consistently precipitates ZnO when added Such a solution had the characteristics: 32.45% w/w Zn(NH3)4F2, and pH = 11.85. The pH for successful ZnO depositing precursors falls within the range pH \u00e0\u00e0 [10.33,11.85]. The ZnO precipitate is confirmed by X-ray diffraction. Additionally, the solution deposits Zn(OH)F onto hydroxyapatite (the material that makes up dentin), and is supported by EDS data from scanning electron mi- croscopy. Mei ML; Lo EC; Chu CH.

A parallel problem can be formu- lated on graphs, focusing on subsets of a given size with minimal connections to their complements. Our research pivots on this dual perspective, delving into its deeper implications and connections to the spectral gap in sur - face theory and the theory of expanders. To execute our proposed research, we will adopt a multifaceted method- ological approach that encompasses both theoretical and applied aspects. A thorough literature review of the spec- tral gap in isoperimetric problems on graphs and classical surface theory (Hodgson, 2003) is included, along with an in-depth analysis of mathematical models, shedding light on the properties and characteristics of isoperimet- ric minimizers. In addition, we will investigate the iso- perimetric problem on specific singular surfaces, e.g. the double disk. Furthermore, with the isoperimetric prob- lem's multidimensional aspects being central to expand- er graphs (Linial and Wigderson, 2003), we extend our exploration to diverse applications, leveraging random walks on expanders to enhance randomized algorithms' success rates. Furthermore, we scrutinize the integration of expander graphs into neural network architectures for efficiency optimization. Ultimately, our research could contribute to a better understanding of expander graphs and their potential applications in various fields, including computer science and optimization theory. In the future, this may contribute to the development of more efficient and accurate algorithms. Applying Emotion Artificial Intelligence to Help Predict the Stock Market of Luxury Goods Qi Wu, Economics and Mathematics Sponsor(s): Professor Anasse Bari, Computer Science The luxury market is known to be heavily influ- enced by consumer sentiment, emotions, and perceptions. Psychologists' research has shown that luxury is typi- cally consumed for reasons related to both internal and external motivations, i.e., ostentation, social positioning, and status symbol accumulation (Amatulli and Guido). Therefore, it is essential to realize the potential effect of public emotions on the stock performance of a luxu- ry company. In this work, we investigate whether public sentiment, as expressed in large-scale collections of daily Instagram, Glassdoor, and Reddit posts, can be used to predict the stock price of two major luxury companies, 113Mo\u00b4t Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) and Pinault S.A. Pinault-Printemps-Redoute PPR (Kering). First, we use emotional artificial intelligence to analyze consumer and employer feedback on the selected companies. Then, we explore the predictive correlation between collective opinion and the movements of luxury stock prices. At last, we compare the model performance of the two luxury companies with two necessity companies' stock (Amer - ican Water Works (NYSE: AWK) and American States Water Company (NYSE: AWR)) to further investigate the value of sentiment analysis in the luxury stock market. The findings of this study can help investors and stake- holders as a supplement to conventional comments in the luxury market to make informed decisions and predict stock prices. It is also valuable in behavioral economics with analyses related to the luxury market. Additionally, this study contributes to the growing field of emotional AI, implanting the framework into more complex models and its application in finance.Testing Current Text Generation Technologies on the UN SDG Report Dataset Laurel Xiang, Computer Science, Data Science Sponsor(s): Professor Anasse Bari, Computer Science Collegiate Research Scholar In 2015, government leaders worldwide adopted the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. Regarded as a \"shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future\", the agenda is known for outlining 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Around 40 UN member countries voluntarily report on progress towards agenda implementation annually. In the past, readers have combed through individual reports, a lengthy and time-consuming process. NLP techniques such as text summarization can speed up the process by extracting important information without actually reading each report. There are 2 main categories of text summari- zation today: extractive and abstractive. Extractive sum- marization is when a summary is generated using existing text from the original dataset. Abstractive summarization is when an original summary of a source text is gener - ated. Two models, one extractive and one abstractive, were tested and evaluated on the UN SDG report data- set to determine the feasibility of the automation of this task. These models, graph-based sentence ranking based 114on Google's PageRank and deep learning neural networks using GPT-3, respectively, were selected based on litera- ture review. Data was acquired using a web scraper and was then processed and cleaned. Non-English reports were excluded. The reports were split into training, test, and validation sets for model testing. The models were then tested using these data splits and tuned according- ly. The summaries were then compared based on metrics including quality, cost, scalability and running time. This research demonstrates the potential of NLP techniques on domain-specific tasks. Speed Discrimination in the Parafoveal and Peripheral Visual Field Yuan (Taylor) Xie, Neural Science Dr. Manu Raghavan, Neural Science; Professor Anthony Movshon, Neural Science Collegiate Research Scholar Speed discrimination is important for survival rea- sons including reaching and grasping, object tracking, and depth perception. Motion sensitivity in the fovea, where humans have a high spatial resolution, is thought to be bet- ter than the sensitivity in the periphery. In a classic study, Mckee and Nakayama (1984) tested speed discrimination at three eccentricities using different stimuli for fovea and periphery. While they concluded that speed sensitivity did not change substantially across eccentricities, a system- atic examination of speed discrimination thresholds as a function of speed, eccentricity, and stimulus class still needs to be completed. In our study, we replicated McKee and Nakayama's conclusions and examined differences in discrimination thresholds between stimulus classes across speeds and eccentricities. We used a variable stimulus duration task that allowed us to test whether integration time is consistent across conditions and explore the role of spatiotemporal limits on motion perception. By using a modified 2 alternative forced choice task with 4 human subjects, we were able to confirm that the speed thresh- olds reach an asymptote at 5% to 10% of the reference speed across eccentricities tested, confirming the results of McKee and Nakayama 1984. Speed discrimination is, however, equally precise for random dots and bars across speeds. Still, parafovea is more sensitive to dots while the periphery is sensitive to bars. We also noticed a differ - ence in evidence integration between stimulus classes and we were able to quantify this difference as the difference in the minimum stimulus exposure time needed to reach peak performance.Changes in AMPAR Expression in the mPFC and Its Relation to Ameliorating Anorexia-like Symptoms in Adolescent Mice Treated with Ketamine Bridget Xu, Neural Science Sponsor(s): Professor Chiye Aoki, Neural Science Collegiate Research Scholar Anorexia nervosa is a severe and deadly eating dis- order that still lacks an FDA-approved pharmacotherapy treatment. A potentially promising treatment is ketamine, which is known to be an NMDA receptor antagonist. Dif- ferent treatments of ketamine were given to mice under - going activity-based anorexia (ABA), an animal model for anorexia nervosa. While the 3mg/kg of body weight dose was not effective, the 30mg/kg dose of ketamine was successful, boosting adaptive traits by increasing food consumption, increasing body weight, and decreasing wheel running. The goal of the project is to examine the molecular basis for the difference in the success of the two treatments, as the molecular mechanisms by which ketamine works are still not understood. Previous stud- ies have shown that when ketamine is used as an antide- pressant, ketamine's effect is occluded if AMPA receptor expression was blocked, indicating that AMPA receptors play a key role in ketamine's function. Additionally, some studies have found that ketamine is associated with in- creased levels AMPA-GluR1. This project aims to exam- ine the levels and distribution of AMPA receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of mice that have under - gone ABA induction and different treatments of ketamine. Quantitative assessments will be made of the proportion of excitatory synapses onto pyramidal neurons and GAB- Aergic interneurons that contain AMPA receptors versus those that do not. Then, correlation analyses on the behav- ioral measurements will examine the potential relation- ship between AMPA receptors and adaptive traits. This project will contribute to understanding how ketamine works to treat anorexia nervosa. Identifying How Synaptic Partners of Drosophila Circadian Pacemaker Neurons Change during Plasticity Angelina Xu, Neural Science Sponsor(s): Professor Justin Blau, Biology Daniel A. and Amy L. Rock Research Scholar A major focus in neuroscience is identifying cir - cuits of neurons. However, this is complicated by changes in connectivity of these circuits due to brain plasticity. In the context of the circadian clock in Drosophila melano- gaster (fruit fly), the circadian pacemaker neurons show predictable daily plasticity, which seems to be important for 24-hour rhythms in behavior. I have focused on the small ventral lateral neurons (s-LNvs), a subset of the pacemaker neurons, which set the pace of the circadian clock and display considerable structural changes across 11524 hours. Using a modified \"trans-Tango\" genetic tool to identify the neurons that s-LNvs communicate with, I have made two major findings. First, I have found that s-LNvs communicate with a different set of neurons during devel- opment compared to adulthood. Second, I also found that s-LNvs communicate with a subset of neurons in a dusk- like state compared to the total set of downstream neurons that s-LNvs connect with over the day. These findings may support the idea that daily synaptic plasticity under - lies changes in circadian behavior. The Application of Machine Learning in Wine Pricing Albert Yan, Computer Science, Economics; Justin Li, Economics and Mathematics Sponsor(s): Professor Karl Storchmann, Economics; Professor Matthew Zeidenberg, Computer Science Collegiate Research Scholar Spanish red wines get a lot of press for being good values, but shopping for Spanish wine can be daunting without knowledge of quality and price. Using historical price data of 7500 different types of red wines from Spain with 11 features that describe Spanish Wines' price, rat- ing, and flavor ranking, this paper examines the use of logistic regression, a random forest classifier, and an ex- tra tree classifier to predict the price of wines in terms of different subjective measures of quality of Spanish wines as well as other wine characteristics. It provides an as- sessment of the predictive accuracy of these methods and intends to show the potential in using machine learning techniques in wine price prediction. Settlement of Buoyant Structure within a Density Varying Profile Mengzhe Yan, Mathematics, Economics Sponsor(s): Professor Samuel Boury, Mathematics Flow-material interactions have motivated numer - ous studies over the past few years, notably for the study of geomorphology and tracer dispersion. Despite its rele- vance in geophysical flows such as the oceans, the dynam- ics of buoyant material structures in stratified fluids re- mains, however, poorly understood. While dense objects tend to sink and light structures to float, materials whose density matches particular values within the stratification would settle at predetermined depths, in specific equilib- rium positions. Depending on the shape of the buoyant object and on its physical properties (e.g. its density (in) homogeneity), the resulting dynamics and equilibrium position(s) are non-trivial. Drawing on these consider - ations, we intend to derive a settling model for buoyant particles in a stratified environment, through a mathemat- ical and numerical study. Starting from the dynamics of an ideal mass localized in a single point, and later extending it to chain-mass models with potential inhomogeneities, we seek to understand how such buoyant structures settle within a density varying profile, and apply it to simple case studies such as filaments of microplastics or sea- weeds. Bi-path Neural Prosthetic Arm, Able to Receive and Act upon EMG and Give Feedback to the Human Body Howard Ye, Data Science, Psychology Sponsor(s): Professor Pablo Ripolles, Psychology; Professor Xiangqing Li, Shandong First Medical University Varet Family Research Scholar The Bi-Path Neural Prosthetic Arm is a novel approach to neuro-prosthetics, integrating three patent- ed technologies: the Touch Sense Projection Map, the Bi-Path Neural Prosthetic Arm system, and the Artifi- cial Ligament Prosthetic. Its primary goal is to enhance affordability and accessibility for amputees. The design proposes a bi-directional system harnessing Electromy- ography (EMG) signals from the user's limb for motor function and delivering tactile feedback through artificial skin, facilitated by the Touch Sense Projection Map. This interaction promises a more intuitive user-prosthetic re- lationship. A custom Printed Circuit Board (PCB) was developed for the sensor and muscle motor system, with 3D models created using SolidWorks and Shapr3D. The prosthetic distinguishes itself with a human-like skin appearance and enhanced motor and sensory functions without the necessity of invasive surgery. Potential ap- plications extend to Virtual Reality (VR) and unmanned vehicle operation. Mimicking human joint structures, the design employs ligament soft robotics technology and touch sense restoration, aiming to replicate the aesthetics and functionality of a human arm. This technology has the potential to democratize neuro-prosthetics and improve amputees' quality of life. Phosphomimetic eIF2 Decreases Protein Synthesis and Increases Tau Phosphorylation Astra Yu, Neural Science Sponsor(s): Dr. Harrison Evans, Neural Science Collegiate Research Scholar Tauopathies, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), are a group of neu- rodegenerative diseases characterized by the hyperphos- phorylation and aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein, tau. Tauopathies have recently been shown to be associated with a dysfunction of neuronal protein synthe- sis in the brain (Evans, Benetatos et al., 2019), a process that is crucial for long-term memory consolidation. How- ever, it is still unclear whether decreased protein synthesis affects tau phosphorylation and aggregation, and whether such an interaction may play a causal role in tauopathy. Here we show that pharmacologically inhibiting either 116protein synthesis or degradation in human embryonic kid- ney (HEK293) cells increases both tau phosphorylation and aggregation. Additionally, to help explore whether these changes occur in vivo, we developed a genetically encodable method for decreasing protein synthesis which employs phosphomimetic eIF2(S52D) to reduce cap-de- pendent translation. We show that transfecting HEK293 cells with eIF2(S52D) causes a decrease in protein syn- thesis and that decreasing protein synthesis in this manner also induces tau aggregation. This genetic approach opens the possibility for inducing long-term and cell-type-spe- cific decreases in protein synthesis in other model systems to study the role of chronically-impaired protein synthesis in neurodegenerative disease. Behavior-Content Fusion for Music Presentation Yichen Yu, Computer Science, Mathematics; Charlie Chen, Computer Science, Mathematics Sponsor(s): Professor Gus Xia, Computer Science and Engineering; Professor Pascal Wallisch, Psychology Joseph A. Rice Research Scholar A filter bubble is one of the most important existing problems in the recommendation area. Dominic Spohr, who is a graduate student in London Metropolitan Uni- versity describes in his paper \"Fake news and ideological polarization: Filter bubbles and selective exposure on so- cial media\", \"Some theorists claim that the algorithmic curation that filters our our online experiences effectively places us in echo chambers of our own beliefs and it the stronger cause of polarization.\". The modern recommen- dation algorithms are largely based on filtering collaborat- ing, which will make the problem of filter bubbles inevita- ble. To see why this happens, we firstly need to understand what is filtering collaborating. As Taghi M. Khoshgoftaar, who is a Professor of Computer Science Department at Florida Atlantic University says in the article \"A Survey of Collaborative Filtering Techniques\", \"Collaborative fil- tering (CF) uses the known preferences of a group of users to make recommendations or predictions of the unknown preferences for other users.\" Optogenetic Manipulation of Basal Ganglia Pathways Zeng, Neural Science Sponsor(s): Dr. Haixin Liu, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Neuroscience and Physiology; Professor Nicolas Tritsch, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Neuroscience and Physiology Joseph Gilbride Research Scholar, Kurt M. Mislow Research Encouragement Scholar Parkinson's Disease (PD) results from the progres- sive degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. It has long been thought that motor dysfunction caused by PD is related to dopamine reliant pathways in the basal ganglia. Of those pathways, the di- rect pathway, mediated by direct spiny projection neurons (dSPNs), is thought to increase movement output and up- regulate movement vigor. On the other hand, the indirect pathway, mediated by indirect spiny projection neurons (iSPNs), is thought to decrease movement output and downregulate movement vigor. Under the rate model, this interplay between the direct and indirect pathway firing rates has been proposed to maintain the balance of phys- iological movement vigor. However, while foundational optogenetic studies have shown the efficacy of the rate model in open fields, a host of recent studies have called into question whether dSPNs are actually gain modula- tory. In our experiment, we used optogenetic stimulation of dSPNs and iSPNs to investigate if their firing rates af- fect movement vigor in a self-paced lever task. By per - forming manipulations during an isolated movement, we could identify if dSPN and iSPN firing rates performed gain modulation of particular movement programs. We found that both dSPN and iSPN stimulation had diverse effects on movement vigor, leading us to conclude that basal ganglia pathways do not only take up a gain mod- ulatory function in cortical motor programs, as the rate model would suggest. This information is important for the further investigation of basal ganglia's role in move- ment modulation as it pertains to PD. Laboratory Icebergs Melt Down and Flip Over: Shape and Capsize Dynamics of Free-floating Melting Ice Steven Zhang, Mathematics, Computer Science Sponsor(s): Professor Leif Ristroph, Mathematics Daniel A. and Amy L. Rock Research Scholar In physical contexts, ice floats and as it changes shape may flip over or capsize. For icebergs, these cap- size events can generate massive waves that damage ice shelves, creating new icebergs that undergo the same capsize process. A detailed understanding of the mecha- nisms behind these processes is essential for predicting and preventing such events. Laboratory and numerical studies have examined the dynamics of single-capsize events, with an emphasis on gravitational stability and wave production. However, previous studies have not considered the long-time coupling between capsizing and melting. Here we study the shape and capsize dynamics of free-floating melting ice. We will discuss an experimental system for studying the combined effects of melting and stability. Based on the experimental observations, we de- velop a minimal moving interface model which character - izes the rigid body dynamics, interface dynamics (through theta-L method), and melting model. We also analyze the capsize statistics, melt rate, and estimation of the terminal geometry.117Range Functions of Any Convergence Order and Their Amortized Complexity Analysis Ya Shi Zhang, Mathematics, Computer Science Sponsor(s): Professor Chee Yap, Computer Science Collegiate Research Scholar We address the fundamental problem of comput- ing range functions \\box{f} for a real function. In our previous work in ISSAC 2021, we introduced a family of recursive interpolation range functions based on the Cornelius-Lohner framework f decomposing f as f=g+r. The CL framework by allowing g(I) to be approximated by strong range functions \\box{f(I;\\epsilon)}, where \\ep- silon>0 is an a priori error bound. This new framework allows, for the first time, the design of interval forms for f with any desired order of convergence. To achieve our strong range functions, we generalize Neumaier's theory of constructing range functions from expressions over a Lipschitz class \\Omega of primitive functions. We show that the class \\Omega is very extensive and includes all common hypergeometric functions. Traditional complex- ity analysis of range functions is based on individual eval- uation on an interval. Such analysis cannot differentiate between our novel recursive range functions and classical Taylor-type range functions. Empirically, our recursive functions are superior in the \"holistic\" context of the root isolation algorithm EV AL. We now formalize this holistic approach by defining the amortized complexity of range functions over a subdivision tree. Our theoretical model agrees remarkably well with the empirical results. Among our previous novel range functions, we identified a La- grange-type range functions \\box_3^{L'}{f}as the overall winner. In this paper, we introduce a Hermite-type range function \\box_4^H{f} that is better. We further explore speeding up applications by choosing non-maximal recur - sion levels. Applying Dynamic Mode Decomposition and Perturbation Method on Climate Data Yuan Zhang, Computer Science and Mathematics Sponsor(s): Professor Olivier Pauluis, Mathematics Collegiate Research Scholar The aim of the research is to investigate how the cli- mate modes are changing over time, given the necessary datasets. In this research, I will continue the project pro- posed in the last DURF application.As part of this DURF project, I plan to address three broad questions:- Can we assess the low frequency variability in the atmospheric energy transport as captured by Baroclinic Annular Mode (BAM) in a new dataset - the ERA5 Reanalysis from the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecast- ing?- What is the link between BAM and the hydrological cycle?- Can new machine learning methods provide ad- ditional insights into the low frequency variability?In the project, the climate datasets will be examined, and matri-ces representing climate trends will be calculated and ana- lyzed. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of such matrices contain information about some constant climate trends as well as some evolving trends over time. Besides cy- clic trends related to seasons and other time cycles, there are also trends that reflect climate change over decades. If these trends can be interpreted by their physics mean- ing, by expectation, then some predictions about future climate change could be predicted, in the short run. The Three-Vortex Problem Yuqian Zhang, Economics and Mathematics, History; Yiling Ding, Economics and Mathematics Sponsor(s): Dr. Christiana Mavroyiakoumou, Mathematics Collegiate Research Scholar In this project, we studied the problem of three in- teracting vortices (the so-called three-vortex problem) and the interaction of three gravitational bodies (known as the three-body problem). In celestial mechanics, the N-body problem refers to a system of N bodies that interact with one another through gravitational forces with interesting interaction patterns arising depending on the conditions of the system, such as mass, and initial positions. In the case of multiple interacting vortices interesting patterns can also arise, and these significantly change when vary- ing the strengths and initial locations of the vortices. A main difference between the three-body problem in ce- lestial mechanics and the three-vortex problem in vortex dynamics is that the vortex strengths can be of either sign whereas the particle masses can only be positive. P38 MAPK Signaling during Long-term Memory Induction is Required for Later Reinstatement after Forgetting Jackie Zhao, Psychology, Neural Science Sponsor(s): Professor Thomas Carew, Neural Science Sigal Scholar The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) has been implicated in learning and memory for - mation in animals ranging from mollusks to mammals. We have demonstrated that, in the marine mollusk Aply- sia californica, p38 MAPK activity underlies sensitization of the tail-elic- ited siphon withdrawal reflex. Noting its place in a mo- lecular cascade which prolongs the expression of learn- ing-induced mRNA (Mirisis et al., 2021), we sought to determine if p38 MAPK plays a role in the establishment of a molecular memory trace for later reinstatement, or 'savings' memory. Similar to previous observations, we found that p38 MAPK activation increases 1 hour after LTM training (4 tail-shocks separated by 15 min). Block- ing p38 MAPK activity with the inhibitor SB203580 during LTM training has no effect on memory 24 hours 118later, but enhances LTM at 48 hours. Interestingly, block- ing p38 MAPK activity during LTM training blocks the reinstatement of memory following its decay (forgetting) by 'savings' training (sub-threshold reminder training). Therefore, in line with our previous observations on the role of p38 MAPK in promoting mRNA stability, we hypothesize that p38 MAPK supports a cellular process which creates a latent mRNA trace for reinstating the memory after it is forgotten. These findings provide evi- dence for a dual action of p38 MAPK in (i) opposing LTM formation by constraining CREB-mediated transcription, but also (ii) supporting saving memory through distinct, yet unelucidated mechanisms. Making the Most Out of the Limited Context Length: Predictive Power Varies with Clinical Note Type and Note Section Hongyi Zheng, Mathematics, Computer Science; Yixin Zhu, Mathematics, Computer Science Sponsor(s): Professor Eric Oermann, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Neurosurgery; Lavendar Jiang, Data Science Collegiate Research Scholar Recent advances in large language models has led to renewed interest in natural language processing in healthcare using the free text of clinical notes. One distin- guishing characteristic of clinical notes is their long time span over multiple long documents. The unique structure of clinical notes creates a new design choice: when the context length for a language model predictor is limit- ed, which part of clinical notes should we choose as the input? Existing studies either choose the inputs with do- main knowledge or simply truncate them. We propose a data-driven framework to select the sections with high predictive power. Using MIMIC-III, we show that: 1) predictive power distribution is different between nurs- ing notes and discharge notes and 2) combining different types of notes could improve performance when the con- text length is large. Our findings suggest that a carefully selected sampling function could enable more efficient information extraction from clinical notes.Mastering Multiplex Immunofluorescence Imaging and Analysis: The Path from a Basic Test Platform for Immuno-Oncology. Anastasia Zhurova, Global Public Health/Biology Sponsor(s): Professor Cynthia Grossman School of Medicine, Pathology; Professor Valeria Mezzano, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Pathology The complexity and diversity of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) plays a significant role in de- termining a cancer phenotype. Thus, a significant body of evidence is collected supporting that \"microenviron- mental\" interactions between tumor cells and adjacent non-tumor cells contribute to tumor cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. There are two main approaches to evaluate the nature of these cell-cell interactions: high resolution imaging and analyses of genes expressed by tumor cells. Quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence (qmIF) is a novel in situ technique which allows for visualization of multiple cells in the same tumor specimen. Here we demonstrate utilization of the qmIF approach to characterize TIME using human formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor sam- ples from patients with melanoma and malignant breast cancer. The panel used for the analysis was designed to locate the following: CD3 (T were obtained by machine learning analysis "}
