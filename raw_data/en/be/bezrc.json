[MEET THE TEAM](https://apn.com/about/apn-team/) AN OPTIMAL HEALING ENVIRONMENT The typical detox environment is sterile, cold, and uninviting, but we've built a facility that is the exact opposite. Each room is outfitted with your comfort in mind, from a luxury mattress to high end touches that make you feel a little more at home. With natural filtered light in the common areas and dimmable lighting in your room, you'll find a balance of controlled stimuli that can be adjusted to your preference. Our locker room-style bathrooms offer a spa-like shower with massive private stalls, just steps away from your recovery suite. We have a staff chef on-site for healthy, healing meals and snacks, plus plush sofas in the common area if you want to socialize with other clients.
