People are toxic and literally starving for nutrients in spite of their weight. We live in a cesspool of toxicity today. Shampoo, shower soap, shower water, drinking water, conditioners, shaving cream, makeup, deodorants, mouthwash, toothpaste, perfumes/colognes, laundry detergent, the many chemicals we breath from the air and hair products like gel, hair spray and moose are just a few of the many things that are loaded with disease causing toxins. Many of the chemicals in the ingredient lists of common products are almost unpronounceable. These are just the tip of the iceberg and they make you sick. Over time, they gum up your body and make everything function worse. When they get into the body, they are like glue; they need to be purposefully and selectively removed, which is done mostly with herbs and other specific detoxification supplements. - Toxins cause disease. This has become abundantly clear in modern society. Seven out of every ten people in the USA die from cancer or heart disease. Heart disease is caused by inflammation. Inflammation occurs largely from not getting antioxidants to neutralize free radicals that cause cell destruction in the walls of the arteries, which cholesterol has to fix. Antioxidants come from vegetables and fruit. Cancer is a breakdown of the immune system. The immune system, like the arteries, needs a daily renewal of good nutrients that comes from vegetables and fruit to stay strong, healthy and vigorous. - Deficiency of nutrients causes disease. This also has become abundantly clear. One a physical level, the understanding becomes clear and simple: Cleanse out toxins and eat an abundance of vegetables and some fruit. When this happens, the results and changes that can happen in the body are astounding, even in a short period of time like 14 days. Detoxifying has purpose to cleanse and renew the body. Weight loss happens as a byproduct. Call me crazy, yes, I'm doing a detox before Christmas and New Years. Why? Because a good time is almost never convenient to completely alter ones diet and cleanse the body. You just have to do it. I'm not going to go into tons of detail about this detoxification, simply because I like to keep things simple. For the next 2 weeks I am going to do an organic juice fast, along with taking some supplementation to cleanse the body of toxins. I will be making 5 juices per day, which will ensure I get at least 12-15 servings of veggies per day. This is a simple plan that most people can do themselves with minimal setup to get started. Make sure ALL of the vegetables and fruit are 100% organic. Introducing more toxins (pesticides) into the body is counterproductive. This detoxification is a modified version of the [Standard Process 21 day Purification Program](https://www.standardprocess.com/Products/Standard-Process/Purification-Product-Kit-Gastro-Fiber#.Vm4LX7iDGkp), which I recommend highly. Here is how my day is set up: 6:30am - Awake and drink 16 ounces of pure filtered water at room temperature 6:40am - Juice 2 grapefruits (which makes about 12-14 ounces of juice). They are hard to find organic right now, but are low on the pesticide list. Use organic oranges if you can't find grapefruit. 6:50am - Oil pulling using organic coconut oil, shower and get dressed. 7:10am - Make shake with [SP Complete Dairy Free](https://www.standardprocess.com/Products/Standard-Process/SP-Complete-Dairy-Free#.Vm4DR7iDGko) (2 scoops). This is a great product to have on hand anytime you are rushed and would like a good quality meal replacement. The cost is $65 dollars and consuming 4 scoops per days will last 15 days. 7:20-8:00am - Emotional processing, reading and prayer. Emotional and spiritually healing is the most important part of any detoxification! 8:00-8:20am - Make 24 ounces of green juice. Green juice is 1 head of romaine lettuce, bunch of kale, a few carrots and an apple. Drink 12 and store the rest in a mason jar (refrigerate). The best practice is to make juice fresh every time so that you get the enzymes, which are arguably the most important part of the juice. The enzymes will die within 15-60 minutes after making juice. I recommend the Hamilton Beach Big Mouth Juicer, which can be purchased at Target or Walmart for $60. A blender (Ninja or Vitamix) is not the same as a juicer. 10:30am - Drink remaining 12 ounces of green juice 12:30pm - warm up on stove, not a microwave and eat Hippocrates Soup. The soup is a part of the famous Gerson Therapy for reversing degenerative disease. Its thermal quality (consumed warm/hot) and ingredients (garlic and onion) balance out the cold nature of the juice. Again, these must be all organic. 1 medium celery knob or 3-4 stalks of celery 1 medium parsley root - if available Garlic as desired 2 small leeks (if not available, replace with 2 medium onions) 1 \u00bd pounds tomatoes or more 2 medium onions 1 pound of potatoes A little parsley. Throw everything into a pot, skins and all, simmer on stove for 1.5 hours. 3:30pm - Drink SP Complete shake (2 scoops) in 12 ounces of pure filtered water. 5:00pm - Juice 24 ounces of carrot/apple juice. Juice consists of 1 apple and enough carrots to make 24 ounces. Drink 12 ounces, refrigerate the rest. 6:00pm - Steam (not bake or cook) and eat any variety of broccoli, okra, brussel sprouts, green beans or asparagus. A little organic cold pressed coconut oil can be added. No salt. 7:30pm - Drink last 12 ounces of carrot/apple juice *Snack on and eat any variety of raw vegetables throughout the course of the day. Drink any amount of pure filtered water when deemed necessary. Whole Food Supplementation In addition to the SP Complete Dairy Free, a number of other supplements are recommended to enhance the detoxification. [SP Cleanse](https://www.standardprocess.com/Products/Standard-Process/SP-Cleanse#.Vm4G1riDGko)($24 for 150 Capsules): SP Cleanse combines 20 unique whole food and botanical ingredients designed to support the body's normal toxin-removal processes. [Gastro-Fiber](https://www.standardprocess.com/Products/Standard-Process/Gastro-Fiber#.Vm4Ho7iDGko)($20 for 150 Capsules): Contains psyllium husk, fenugreek, fennel, apple pectin and collinsonia to help gently cleanse the intestinal tract. [Linum B6](https://www.standardprocess.com/Products/Standard-Process/Linum-B6#.Vm4IK7iDGko)($16 for 120 Perles): Flaxseed oil plus B6. I took my regular whole food supplements as well. This is a modified detoxification from the [Standard Process 21 day Purification Program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgSgV_XyJFI). The have a wonderful [Purification Guide](https://www.standardprocess.com/Products/Literature/Patient-Purification-Program-Guide) that walks you through exactly how to do the program. A 118 page [Purification Cookbook](https://www.standardprocess.com/Standard-Process-Document-Library/Books/PurificationCookbookB0980.pdf) is also available to make meal planning easy during the 21 days. The program is super easy to follow. I choose to do 14 days because I'm traveling for the holidays and it will be not a convenient to do. I HIGHLY recommend you do this program; the cost is only $231 dollars. If you are interested, kits can be purchased directly through me. Please call Dr. Scott at 407-255-0314 to order. The hardest part of any detoxification is days two through five. You may get headaches, fatigue, stomach pains, dizziness and other things. You can use this powerful WEIGHT LOSS TECHNIQUE or EFT to deal with all of these symptoms. Most just tough it out, but after day 5 things get much easier. I always start on a Thursday so that the hardest days fall on the weekend when I am not working. If you have ever wanted to detoxify your body, the 21 day Standard Process Purification Program is one of the best around. This something we should do once every year due to how toxic our world is and how deficient we can get in nutrients. It is easy to follow, you get meal plans for every day, and it is a small investment for the price of excellent health. People rave all the time of the amazing benefits that this program has had in their lives. Call today to order (407-255-0314) or stop by the clinic in Orlando, Florida and get started now. "}
