The use of herbs to promote and support human well-being, dates back thousands of years. Every civilization has documented its use of herbs in ancient manuscripts. One-fourth of contemporary medicines are still derived from plants or are synthetic copies of substances originally identified in nature. After centuries of use, herbs continue to play a vital role in promoting health of the modern consumer. Medicinal properties of plants are fairly well known and widely used. For untold ages these plants have been utilized for health and magickal purposes. However never ingest an herb without first consulting a physician, herbalist or an herbal guide book. Magickal Herbs work on the physical, emotional, mental, spiritual and magickal levels. They do not just change our person, but they can transform the environment around us. They can actually cause events to occur, which can correct or enrich our lives. Nature has provided a veritable magical pantry in the plants which cover our planet. The weeds and wildflowers that grace our cities and wildernesses, the ornamental and food plants in our gardens, even common house plants still possess incredible powers. Magickal herbalism is the use of these powers. Many of our herbs can be used for traditional purposes but some are for magickal and aromatherapy use only.

In America Indian traditions we call this practice \"Smudging\" or sometimes \"Smoking\" even though the herbs may not be inhaled. Smudging takes many forms. Sometimes we tie the herbs in a bundle called a \"Smudge Stick\", some, such as Sweetgrass, are braided. Sometimes branches of herbs are placed directly into an open fire. Most often a piece of charcoal is placed in a container, such as a small cauldron or abalone shell, and the herbs are sprinkled on the hot coals. The main idea behind burning herbs is to release their energy and fragrance, not to fill your room or lungs with smoke. Different herbs may be used for different purposes. Commonly, Sage, Sweetgrass, Lavender and/or Cedar are burned to purify one's self, one's space and one's spiritual or healing tools. We fan the smoke over our tools or bodies, usually with a feather. First fan the smoke towards the heart, then inhaling, pulling it up over the head, down the arms, etc. We also burn herbs during healing work and prayer or meditation. This helps one connect to their Spirit Guides. Sage Spirit and Mt. Shasta Smudge Wands Smudge Feathers A reminder of the power and beauty of your soaring spirit.
