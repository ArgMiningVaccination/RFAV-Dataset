Ces notes de programme sont \u00e9crites par l'\u00e9tudiant-interpr\u00e8te : Ellen's MMus Recital A conversation with nature Nature takes on many functions in the music of this program: catharsis for the lovesick; language for the lovestruck; and an echo for the soul. The latter is the most important. When we understand the physical environment as a reflection of ourselves we reject the dualism of \"nature\" vs \"human\" and introduce the possibility of an interdependence and a communion with the land. Far removed from Renaissance Europe, constructing this program has evoked some critical thinking about what it means to be a descendant of colonial settlers and how their insistence on dominating nature has contributed to the broken ecologies on Turtle Island today. I grew up beside Lake Ontario, known as Niigaani-gichigami by the Ojibwe people who lived there before me. Growing up, the lake was my refuge, my confidant, and the place where my creativity was most inspired. The words of Henriette Coligny de la Suze in the first piece of the program evoke the memories of feeling seen and held by nature through all the trials of adolescence. Like the Renaissance composers, my connection and proximity to nature have influenced my artistic life and provided me a sanctuary where I can go to feel healed and whole. In European cultures the concept of nature is inseparable from its regard of the feminine. After all, the word nature derives from the Latin root \"nat\" as in \"natal\" meaning that from which things are born. Consider the peaceful, matrifocal culture of the Minoan Civilization which historian Will Durant calls \"the first link in the European chain\". A goddess of nature was central to the Minoan belief system. The Greek Mycenaean invasion of the Minoans introduced the concept of ownership over nature. The Mycenaean spiritual beliefs were adopted as well, which by this time included several deities that can be found on the Olympic pantheon. These deities become a foundation for Renaissance philosophy and culture. In my program, the 17th century Katherine Philips' translation of \"O Solitude\" references the Olympic god Apollo, but perhaps with a Minoan or feminine understanding of nature's connectedness to the spiritual. The woman goes into nature where she \"learns Apollo's lore without the pains of studying it.\" Centuries later following the development of the scientific revolution, the sense of nature as a divine feminine power was demoted to a bucolic and tameable subject, reducing it to a mere material resource. Even so the music in this program breaks through the scientific paradigm and demonstrates an instinctual impulse to ask for healing, inspiration, and guidance from the land. This is particularly true of female composers. In Strozzi's \"Presso un ruscello algente\" Eurillo pleads to the river to collect his tears for his estranged lover. He asks though, to pause before they reach the ocean so that she may walk in them when she comes to pass. Strozzi's river has agency and power.Prior to colonialism, the Indigenous people of Turtle Island had an active and integral role managing the ecological systems. The concept of an untouched and conserved wilderness separate from humanity is a settler construct that does more harm than good. The Minoan interactions with the land have been historically understood among anthropologists as religious or ritualistic. However, Minoan interaction with the environment draws parallels to traditional ways of knowing and can be better understood as a means of practical engagement, interdependence, and symbiosis. On the program, Castaldi's Echo Notturna embodies this sentiment. The protagonist cries out into the void, and hears their deep inner knowledge reflected back. Through presenting this program of music, I hope to honour the magic of the natural world, inspire a renewed communion with the land, and draw attention to our intrinsic relationship to it, taught to us by the indigenous peoples. Forets solitaires et sombres - se conservent malgr\u00e9 le jour Ne s\u00e7auriez-vous charmer le possede? Et n'avez de remede Contre un cruel et malheureux amour? Solitary and somber forests Where the coolness, silence and shadows are preserved despite the day, Could you not charm The evil which possesses me? And have you no remedy Against a cruel and miserable love? Le repos, l'ombre, le silence - Michel Lambert (1610 - 1696) Le repos, l'ombre, le silence Tout m'oblige en ces lieux \u00e0 faire confidence De mes ennuis les plus secrets. Je me sens soulag\u00e9 d'y conter mon martyre Je ne craint point les indiscrets Stillness, shadows, silence All compel me to divulge the confidence of my most secret troubles I am relieved to tell my sufferings I speak them only to the forest But at least they are said If we want to speak leaving nothing unsaid We are free to do so in this solitary place We fear not inconspicuity During the pandemic, it has been my privilege to visit the St. Lawrence riverside path every day and be in communion with nature. The feeling of being held by the shadowy stillness of the forest is conveyed in these two pieces from the French baroque era. The historical french pronunciation used in this performance was described by B\u00e9nigne de Bacilly in his Remarques curieuses sur l'art de bien chanter (Paris, 1668). A contemporary of both Lambert and Le Camus, Bacilly describes in his treatise that certain vowel pronunciations have more vocal resonance or beauty. Additionally, he explains how the adding a voiced \"s\" or \"r\" to a word conveys grammatical information that may otherwise be unclear to the listener.I'm sick of love (To the Sycamore) - William Lawes (1602 - 1645) Text by Robert Herrick (1591 - 1674) I'm sick of love. Oh, let me lie Under your shade to sleep or die Either is welcome, so here I have Or here my bed or here my grave Why do ye sigh and sob And keep time with the tears that I do weep Do ye have sense, or do ye prove What crucifixions are in love? I know ye do And that's the why ye weep being sick of love as I Can beauty's spring - William Lawes (1602 - 1645) Can beauty's spring admit that snow Should dwell upon the cheek and brow When every lookeron might spy a fire In each neighb'ring eye Can coldness dwell upon those parts Which thaw if not enflame all hearts 'Tis so, and Nature this hath done That she who was intended one The second miracle might show A flame within a bank of snow Only in its title does \"I'm sick of Love (To the Sycamore)\" explicitly mention nature. Yet the entire text is an address to the sycamore tree, asking it to shade the bereft subject as they grieve their troubles in love. This is another example of the emotional catharsis provided by nature, this time from the English baroque era. \"Can beauty's spring\" is a cleverly crafted metaphor for beauty, \"A flame within a bank of snow\" explaining the seemingly impossible and dazzling juxtaposition of the subject's fiery eyes compared to their snow white complexion. O Solitude - Henry Purcell (1659 - 1695) Text by Katherine Philips (1631/2 - 1664) O Solitude, my sweetest choice! Places devoted to the night, Remote from tumult and from noise How ye my restless thoughts delight! O Solitude, my sweetest choice! O heavens! What content in mine To see those trees, which have appear'd From the nativity of time And which all ages have revered To look today as fresh and green As when their beauties first were seen O how agreeable a sightthese hanging mountains do appear Which the unhappy would invite To finish all their sorrows here When their hard fate makes them endure Such woes as only death can cure O, how I solitude adore! That element of noblest wit Where I have learnt Apollo's lore Without the pains to study it For thy sake I in love am grown With what thy fancy does pursue But when I think upon my own I hate it for that reason too Because it needs must hinder me From seeing and from serving thee O solitude, O how I solitude adore! Katherine Philips was one of the most popular poets of Purcell's youth and this translation was continually reprinted throughout the seventeenth century. A distinctly feminine perspective on the longing for solitude, Philips' translation reads like a love poem to the solace of the natural world. She explains her frustration with the urban world and her desire to go away from courtly airs and into a place of the tangible. This framing hearkens to an indigenous understanding of the world explained in Robin Wall Kimmerer's book \"Braiding Sweetgrass'' in which Kimmerer explains that the Ojibwe language is more than 70% verbs. For example, rather than the word \"mountain\" the English equivalent would translate more closely to \"being a mountain\"and such is the case for most \"nouns\". When we see the trees, mountains, and water as having personhood and animacy, we can understand this text as a longing to be with the living world, rather than to go away from it. Rather than a funeral dirge, solitude becomes a communion with life. Fresche Aurette - Francesca Caccini (1587 - 1640) Text Non Sweet breaths you blow this way Amorous little birds New song you compose today Here is the breeze which restores All souls and makes the world lovelier With her the day now returns And is remade even more beautiful There is no nymph in the clear dew That is not drawn to the happy dances Let the shepherds in sweet choirs Come from the woods the sensuous infant Naked cupids come dancing here And raise in song Dawn's praises to the sky This sweet love song to the \"breeze which restores\" was published in 1618 as part of Il primo libro delle musiche, a collection of compositions by Francesca Caccini. Born and raised in the thriving artistic community of the Medici court in 17th century Florence and the daughter of Giulio Caccini, Francesa received a humanistic education including literature, philosophy, and music. She was also an accomplished lutentist and baroque guitarist, often self accompanying her compositions. Though the origin of the text is unclear, it is likely she incorporated much of her own verse into Il primo libro. Echo notturno - Bellerofonte Castaldi (1580 - guai? (Ai) Tu con lamento mi rispondi E par che vi nascondi Che da lei pace non havr\u00f2 gi\u00e0 mai (Mai) Se tanto asprezza in lei s'aduna Altra dia fine a si crudel fortuna Now that the shadowy night Covers the world with silence Only you respond to me, Echo (Here I am) Loving Echo (Dare) But what? If that disloyal and cruel one Refuses to listen to my complaints Then who will end my woe? (Alas) You respond to me with laments and because you hide yourself Will I never have peace from her? (Never) If such bitterness is in her Another may make an end to such cruel fate (Una) Purtroppo io s\u00f2 ch'altri che quella desio Tu del mio ben presaga a Dio s'aduna (A Dio) (One) But I know that none other than she appears before my eyes a more beautiful woman (She) So my thoughts speak to me And say perhaps with time I will become happy (It may be) A happy fate has my love If she reached her sweet desire You, my love, foretell a goodbye (Goodbye) Castaldi has so skillfully crafted the text of \"Echo notturna\" so that each iteration of the echo has a completely different semantic meaning from its \"source\", though they sound phonetically identical. This creates a conversationbetween the narrator and the void, the darkness, or the cave of the psyche. Yet as the narrator speaks, we can tell she understands that the void is she. In Kim Krans' Archetypes oracle deck guidebook she describes the \"cave\" as \"[the place] where one can see the true self in the darkness. In esoteric teaching, the Cave is known to reside in the center of the heart. Within its walls the whispers of compassion and self-understanding can be heard.\" Presso un ruscello algente - Barbara rock Mournful Eurillo drew vers\u00f2 E a l'onda repente And so frequently His plea spilled over And to the wave, suddenly cos\u00ec favell\u00f2 \"Ruscelletto, vago rio brook, graceful rivulet Which flows from rock to rock Stay your step, stop your pace And collect my tears Slow the course of your faint ripple Nor flee quickly to the sea Take with you, oh lovely brook These, my bitter tears Allow yourself at least a rest Dati posa almen soltanto, che the footstep Of my Lilla, my beautiful sun, arrives here That she might walk in my tears Thus did unfortunate Eurillo Ask aid, in vain Of the flowing water Poi ch'\u00e0 temprar l'ardor l'acque de pianti. Thus to quench the fire of sighs Even the water of tears is not enough. \"The river is emotion. When you are in its current, you will know by the bursting forth of tears, laughter, song, despair. All the emotions flow in its current. [The River is] forgiveness embodied in physical form. Without asking anything in return, [it] washes away what is no longer necessary, smoothing over sharp edges and accepting all our mistakes and grievances. Once the tears have passed, we see ourselves as we haven't before; with a little more lightness, grace, and fluidity\" Kim Krans, The Archetypes Guidebook\"In the Buddhist religion, sand mandalas, works of art made of coloured sand, are created over several weeks and ritualistically destroyed once complete. Their disposal into the river emphasizes transience of material and its inevitable release back into nature\" Luria et al S\u00fc\u00dfe Stille ewig ist bereit Even the soul becomes delighted When, I after this time Of hard-working vanity Have before my eyes, that rest That is prepared for us in eternity Meine Seele h\u00f6rt im Sehen Gesicht Allenthalben mit uns spricht My soul hears by sight How, to exalt the Creator Everything cheers, everything laughs Hear now The blooming Spring's splendour Is the language of Nature Who clearly, through sight, Speaks with us everywhere These pieces from Handel's Nine German Arias use poetry from Barthold Heinrich Brockes' Irdisches Vergn\u00fcgen in Gott ('Earthly Comforts of God;'), a collection of texts reflecting on the manifestation of God in nature. Brockes and Handel were friends who both subscribed to Pietism, a movement within Lutheranism emphasizing simplicity and a personal relationship with God. \"The musical relationships with Handel's opera arias are evident in the endless ingenuity of his characterization and the expressive, articulate melodies with which the soprano and the obbligato create their vivid images [...] Handel's willingness to devote more time and detail than usual to notably developed middle sections indicates his artistic sensitivity for his task, and perhaps hints at personal compassion for Brockes's clarification of how appreciating nature consolidates religious faith.\" David Vickers O qui coeli terraequae serenitas - Antonio Vivaldi (1678 - 1741) Prichard Mitis considera Oh what is the calm of heaven and earth The source of light and judgement Whence come the eternal stars Kindly consider Nostra, vota clamores et spes Our prayers, cries, and earth seem unclean When we look to heaven Make us cherish Constantly the heavenly riches And hoping for the eternal That which is transitory We may regard with hatred The rose which dies The water which recedes The world's delights Are all transient Pede praetervolant Larvae fallaces Such deceitful ghosts Scarcely charm with their Pleasant appearance Before flying past, fleet or foot Alleluia Alleluia Like Handel's German arias, Vivaldi uses nature to express a desire for the eternal. With the vivid imagery of the dying rose, the lapping wave, and the deceitful ghosts, Vivaldi paints the music with his evocative metaphors illustrating \"the deliverance of the believer from earthly delights and for his espousal of "}
