Also known as the Three Treasures: Jing, Qi and Shen. These are the three vital substances of the body, that if depleted can lead to severe disease. This is the story of why you should not overwork yourself. We live in a society where the reality can sometimes be that we do not have a choice but to keep pushing even when we are tired. It is important to know that in order to sustain ourselves we should find kinder and gentler ways of living whenever possible. JING - The deepest aspect of metabolism. Essence, root or foundation. Jing comes from your ancestors (genetics) and is responsible for the body's growth, development and reproduction. It is constantly interrelated and will continue to inform you throughout your life. Jing is mostly comprised of genetic material that you are born with. It is very difficult to influence, change or make more jing. Much of your jing is pre-determined and fixed. If you take good care of yourself by eating well, resting and not overworking, it is possible to improve jing. Some jing can be recovered through qi gong cultivation and by taking herbal medicines but you must also be working to preserve your existing jing at the same time. Many formulas that improve jing contain animal products. There is no quick fix on recovering it and it is always suggested to prevent jing depletion. Jing is the force that goes down for manifestation in the world and the force that goes up to support qi metabolism. QI - The force that drives daily functions of metabolism. We have so many different kinds of qi in our body and that can be found in nature. Though qi is sometimes translated as energy in English, that is only one way of describing it. Definitions of qi (ki) can also vary between different Asian cultures! Qi can be used to describe multiple functions in the body. Some of the major functions of qi in the body are: activation, warming, defending, transforming and containing. Each organ has its own qi. Each type of qi has its own job in maintaining the body. Qi is easily regained and cultivated by living a healthy and nourishing lifestyle. SHEN - The cognitive, emotional and spiritual functions of metabolism. The seat of all emotions, controlled by the heart, the spirit or consciousness. Shen is the ability for the mind to form ideas and the desire to live your life. Healthy shen can be seen in the eyes and complexion. When the qi in your body is flourishing, it shows in your eyes and face! In Chinese Medicine, it is important to have good circulation and blood flow because the shen is stored in the blood. When your shen is not intact you can have problems with cognition, consciousness, speech, your emotions and the ability to express yourself. Because the jing is the foundation, it is important to protect and preserve it. When the jing is healthy, qi can flourish and the shen is peaceful. Many theories that are used in Chinese Medicine are also used in politics, military, feng shui and social commentary. This is why such theories can be applied to how we live our lives day to day and not just what we think of as medicine or health in the United States (of America). For those interested in applying such theories to their careers in East Asian Medicine can be invited to [ join my workshop (4/23/23)](https://www.emilygraceacupuncture.com/all/jing-qi-shen-transforming-your-acupuncture-career). Jing, Qi and Shen live in the lower, middle and upper dan tians respectively. The San Jiao is another tripartite system in Chinese Medicine but it is not the same as the San Bao.
