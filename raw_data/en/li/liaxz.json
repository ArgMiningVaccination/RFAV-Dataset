Why should your child be vaccinated or boosted?1 2 COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that can range from mild to severe disease. Spread is mainly through droplets, airborne particles, or touching contaminated surfaces. Symptoms appear 2 to 14 days after exposure, and can include fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, runny nose or loss of smell or taste. Complications can include respiratory failure, heart attacks, blood clots and other long-term problems. Children who get infected with COVID-19 can develop serious complications like Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). All vaccines used in Singapore are assessed by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) to ensure quality, safety and efficacy standards are met. Many common side effects were less commonly observed in children aged 6 months to 4 years as compared to adults and are similar to the side effects of other childhood vaccines. Serious adverse side effects were rare, with no cases of anaphylaxis or pericarditis/myocarditis observed in clinical trials. Studies have shown that two doses of Moderna/Spikevax and three doses of Pfizer-BioNT ech/Comirnaty vaccine in children aged 6 months to 4 years can achieve antibody levels comparable to that achieved in young adults vaccinated with the adult dosage. This is expected to provide a high level of protection against severe disease and reduce the risk of hospitalisation from COVID-19 infection. Based on local data, two vaccine doses in children aged 5 to 11 years helped reduce hospitalisation due to Omicron variant by more than 80% - this high level of protection against severe COVID-19 infection is also expected in children aged 6 months to 4 years.Safety and efficacy of vaccine for your child3 For Children aged 6 months to 4 years: Vaccination can help reduce the risk of infection, severe disease, and hospitalisation in young children. While the risk of severe COVID-19 in young children is generally low, they still face higher risk of hospitalisation as compared to older children. Severe disease, such as pneumonia and MIS-C can still occur as well. With the ongoing transmission of Omicron subvariants and possible future COVID-19 variants, it is important for young children to get vaccinated. For children aged 5 to 11 years, who have received their first two vaccine doses 5 months ago: Antibody levels and vaccine protection against COVID-19 1 2WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE VACCINATING YOUR CHILD VACCINATION PROTECTS M Einfection declines with time, thus taking a third dose is important in sustaining high level of protection against severe disease, and hospitalisation. A third vaccine dose has shown to increase antibody levels to more than twice the level achieved after the first two doses .3 4Can my child receive the COVID-19 vaccine together with other childhood vaccines? 6 What is the recommended interval between doses?5 Children aged 6 months to 4 years are recommended to receive two doses of Moderna/Spikevax vaccine, OR three doses of Pfizer-BioNT ech/Comirnaty vaccine, with doses received 8 weeks apart. Children aged 5 years and above are recommended to receive a third dose of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine 5 months after completion of their first two doses. COVID-19 vaccines should be administered separately from other childhood vaccines unless your doctor recommends differently. Children receiving other non-COVID-19 vaccines are recommended to receive their COVID-19 vaccine at a minimum of 14 days before or after other vaccines. Y our child can receive the COVID-19 vaccine if he/she was previously infected with COVID-19: Children aged 6 months to 4 years are recommended to complete a total of t wo doses of Moderna/Spikevax vaccine OR three doses of Pfizer-BioNT ech/Comirnaty vaccine Children aged 5 to 11 years are recommended to complete a total of three doses of Pfizer-BioNT ech/Comirnaty vaccine Persons who are infected and due for vaccination may receive their vaccination from 28 days after their infection, although it is recommended to do so three months from the infection for better effectiveness.Who should or should not get vaccinated? 4 Y our child should NOT get this vaccine if he/she: Developed anaphylaxis to mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, or Had high-risk allergic reactions to a previous mRNA vaccine, or Is allergic to polyethylene glycol (PEG), one of the vaccine ingredients Doctors' advice is REQUIRED to get your child vaccinated if he/she: Has cancer and undergone chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiation therapy in the past 3 months or planned to in the next 2 months, or Had transplant(s) within the past 3 months, or Is on aggressive immunotherapy (e.g. Rituximab) for non-cancer conditions If your child has not been feeling well for the past 24 hours (e.g. having fever), please defer his/her vaccination until he/she recovers.Can my child receive the COVID-19 vaccine if he/she was recently infected with COVID-19?7 6WHAT TO TAKE NOTE AFTER VACCINATION Pain, redness, swelling at the injection site Fever, chills Headache, muscle pain, joint pain Lymph node swelling at neck or armsTiredness Those with fever are advised to self-isolate at home until the fever subsides. Paracetamol dosed according to the child's weight as needed. Usually gets better by itself in a week or soRestSide effects 9 5 T o register your child for the COVID-19 vaccination, visit child.vaccine.gov.sg How can I get my child vaccinated?8 Y our child should rest and avoid strenuous exercise (e.g. no jogging, swimming, cycling, school PE or sports) for 2 weeks. Y our child might experience side effects that are usually mild or moderate and will resolve in 2 to 3 days. They include: Use the appropriate dosage of paracetamol for your child's weight for pain/fever; avoid NSAIDs like ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, and diclofenac in the 1 to 2 days after vaccination. See a doctor if the side effects persist or gets worse. Y ou may bring your child/ward to any Joint T esting and Vaccination Centre (JTVC) or Children Vaccination Centre. If you prefer to make an appointment, you may register him/her for vaccination at child.vaccine.gov.sg. An SMS invitation with a personalised link will be sent to the registered mobile number within 3 to 5 working days to book an appointment. Priority will be given to those with an appointment. If your child aged 5 to 11 years has completed his/her first two vaccine doses and is eligible for the third vaccine dose, you will receive an SMS with a personalised link to book an appointment. Y ou may also walk in with your child/ward to any JTVC and Vaccination Centre offering the recommended vaccine. For more information on vaccination locations, visit gowhere.gov.sg/vaccine.
