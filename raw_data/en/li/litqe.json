Deprive your body of vitamin C for any significant period of time and you will see your body fall apart. Luckily, even minimal amounts of vitamin C from foods such as grapefruits, oranges, and lemons can prevent a full body breakdown. But for achieving optimal health, food and oral supplements are usually not enough. Vitamin C ascorbate is an antioxidant which is critical to maintaining normal connective tissue and wound healing. Additionally, vitamin C is required for bone remodeling since the collagen part of the organic matrix of bones. The adrenal gland cortex stores high concentrations of vitamin C, which are quickly depleted during high levels of stress due to the formation of the stress hormone cortisol. As a result, it is critical in maintaining high levels of vitamin C during times of significant stress and fatigue. Foods rich in vitamin C that we ingest, only provide about 18% bioavailability of the vitamin C that can be absorbed by our bodies. On the other hand, when vitamin C is administered intravenously by IV, it's 100% bioavailable. What this means is that the high doses of vitamin C available exclusively via IV, powerful health benefits can be achieved including but not limited to: adrenal glands support, consistent levels of energy, skin improvement, and protection, increase in bone and tendons strength, an overall boost to the immune system and lessened side effects from chemotherapy. High dose vitamin C IV therapy, is extremely beneficial and highly effective for those individuals that are under a greater than usual levels of stress, exhibit symptoms of extreme fatigue, require a boost to their immune system in order to fight acute and/or chronic viral and/or bacterial infections, who have damage to the skin as a result of damage from the sun and/or surgery, and to help alleviate such side effects like fatigue, nausea and/or vomiting associated with chemo and radiation therapy. Why High Dose Vitamin C? Vitamin C is the dominant factor in the production of collagen for blood vessels, bones, ligaments and skin. Additionally, vitamin C is critical for adrenalin and cellular energy (carnitine synthesis), antioxidant function and furthering the immune system. Administered intravenously, high doses of vitamin C will be completely bioavailable, guaranteed every time. High Dose Vitamin C IV Therapy for the Production of Collagen Collagen is present in all animal tissue. Generally referenced as a structural protein, collagen is responsible for holding muscle to bones and well as providing structural support for arteries and veins. In order for collagen synthesis to occur (production of collagen), you need vitamin C, and two amino acids; proline and lysine. Those individuals with collagen insufficiency have thin unhealthy-looking skin and weakened blood vessels, bones, ligaments and tendons. Prolonged periods of collagen insufficiency can result in aneurysms due to thinning of blood vessel walls, potential strokes and even sports like injuries such as ruptured tendons and ligaments. These conditions can be completely remedied and even avoided by simply administering high doses of vitamin C via IV. High Dose Vitamin C for Energy Production High doses of vitamin C have a powerful effect on producing energy. Moreover, vitamin C is vital to the breaking down of fat, so the fat can be used as an energy source. This occurs when a synthesized carnitine molecule is created in order to transport fats into the mitochondria of a cell in order to produce energy. Researchers, interested in the correlation between high doses of vitamin C and energy production, conducted a study in 2011. The vitamin C study revealed that when a large, 10-gram dose of vitamin C was administered by IV to office workers, fatigue was reduced within two hours and energy levels remained elevated for the next 24 hours. High Dose Vitamin C IV Therapy for Enhanced Immune Support Current research has also shown that high doses of vitamin C has a precise effect on infectious agents including bacteria, viruses as well as cancer cells. Although the use of vitamin C in cancer therapy is highly debated in the medical community, numerous studies are underway and some have already shown promising results. Prior to the development of the modern-day polio vaccine, high doses of vitamin C injected through the muscle were used to treat polio with some success. In a recent study, mice were genetically modified so that their bodies could not make vitamin C. The mice were then given high doses of vitamin C and were able to increase their anti-influenza cytokines (highly effective immune system cells) and showed that they could fight infections such as the influenza virus. High Dose Vitamin C IV Therapy for Super Antioxidant Protection As a potent antioxidant, vitamin C protects various cell structures in our body, which includes collagen, protein, as well as damage caused by free radicals and reactive oxygen species to DNA as a result of chronic illness, elevated stress, and infections. Modern research has shown that vitamin C's super antioxidant effects can greatly lessen the severity of symptoms connected with the H1N1 influenza virus in addition to being a necessary therapeutic treatment for surviving the flu. High Dose Vitamin C for Cancer and Chemotherapy Vitamin C's use in cancer treatment and therapy has been a controversial one. While there is no one significant and definitive study that has concluded the extent of the benefits from treatments of high doses of vitamin C in cancer treatment, there are some conclusions that have been established from all the various studies. Research studies for high dose vitamin C IV therapy have shown that: - Even extreme doses of vitamin C (greater than 100 grams) are considered safe, non-toxic and show very few side effects. - High dose vitamin C IV therapy, do not cause kidney stones and oxalic acid levels are not elevated by high doses of vitamin C. - At lower doses, vitamin C is an antioxidant, while at high doses it is an oxidant. As an oxidant, vitamin C reacts with iron and oxygen creates high concentrations of peroxide in tissues. Moreover, body immune cells use peroxide in order to destroy foreign and cancer cells. Furthermore, high doses of vitamin C results in ATP depletion and triggers damage to the cancer cell's DNA. - Chemotherapy and radiation (with the exception of methotrexate) can be safely combined with high doses of vitamin C provided that the individual's oncology team is informed and has agreed "}
