In California, few young people are immune from the state's strict vaccination requirements for those attending schools and child care programs. State law requires immunization against a host of childhood diseases, including require proof of vaccinations before students can attend their classes, but there are even better reasons to make sure your children are fully vaccinated. \"Vaccinations are the most important, safest and most effective tools we have to prevent a number of deadly diseases,\" says [Dr. Vikram Anand](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/vikram-anand-273928.html), a specialist in [pediatric infectious diseases](/programs/pediatrics.html) at Cedars-Sinai. [ Provider has video ](/provider/vikram-anand-273928.html) [ Vikram C. Anand, MD, PhD ](/provider/vikram-anand-273928.html) [ Vikram C. Anand, MD, PhD ](/provider/vikram-anand-273928.html) \"Vaccinations are the most important, safe, and effective way we have to prevent a number of deadly diseases.\" Childhood immunizations fell dramatically during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [ordering](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/childhood-vaccination-toolkit.html#:~:text=COVID%2D19%20disrupted%20both%20in,behind%20on%20receiving%20recommended%20vaccines.&text=CDC%27s%20public%20sector%20vaccine%20ordering,down%20by%20more%20than%2020%25) 14% fewer vaccines in the 2020-21 school year. Drops like these leave communities more vulnerable to the spread and resurgence of vaccine-preventable illnesses such as measles. \"While schools provide an important environment for learning and growing, they also provide the perfect opportunity for infections to spread,\" Dr. Anand says. \"Vaccinating children is the best way to prevent this from happening. You're not only keeping your child safe, but you're also protecting sick children with weakened immune systems who can't fight infections.\" Pediatricians and health officials are urging parents to get back on track. Use the list below to make sure your child is up to date on the immunizations required for California child care programs and schools, according to the [California Department of Public Health](http://www.shotsforschool.org/).

California health officials have delayed implementing any COVID-19 vaccine requirements in schools until at least the 2023-24 school year to allow enough time for full compliance. But the CDC now [recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/children-teens.html) everyone 6 months and older get vaccinated against the virus that causes COVID-19. The shots lower the risk of developing serious complications from the coronavirus and its evolving variants. Other vaccines to consider Dr. Anand also recommends children get the [HPV vaccine](/blog/hpv-vaccine-myths-versus-facts.html), which can prevent human papillomavirus (HPV) infections, a cause of cervical cancer and other cancers. \"The HPV vaccine does work better when you give it to children 9 to 11 years old,\" he says. \"In fact, if they get the vaccine before age 14, they only need two doses since they respond much better than older teenagers, who usually need three doses.\" Adults who want to volunteer at schools will need to check with their school for any vaccine requirements or other health clearances. Universities also usually require vaccinations, and students should make sure their shots are up to date before heading back to campus. "}
