An individual who has been photosensitized may develop a rash, sunburn, or other adverse effect from exposure to light of an intensity or duration that would normally not affect that individual. Reactions to photosensitizing agents involve both photoallergy (allergic reaction of the skin) and phototoxicity (irritation of the skin) after exposure to ultraviolet radiation from natural sunlight or artificial lighting (particularly from tanning booths). This photosensitization of the skin may be caused by creams or ointments applied to the skin, by medications taken orally or by injection, or by the use of prescription inhalers. In addition to an exaggerated skin burn, itching, scaling, rash, or swelling, exposure to ultraviolet light in combination with certain medications may result in: - Skin Cancer - Premature skin aging - Skin and eye burns - Allergic reactions - Cataracts (clouding in the eyes) - Reduced immunity - Blood vessel damage The list of photosensitizing medications found on this page was taken from the current literature. The list is not complete; if you are using a product that is not listed, you should consult your physician or pharmacist for guidance. Before using the list, you should be aware of the following: - NOT all individuals who use or take these medications will experience a photosensitive reaction. Also, an individual who experiences a photosensitive reaction on one occasion will NOT necessarily experience it again or every time. Most entries in this listing do not indicate how often a photosensitive reaction has been reported. If an entry includes a percentage in the Brand Name column (in bold type and parentheses), this number is the frequency of reaction reported in reference number 2 in the Bibliography. - A medication will NOT cause the same degree of skin reaction in all individuals. - Brand names or products should be considered only as examples; they do NOT represent all names under which the generic product may be sold.
