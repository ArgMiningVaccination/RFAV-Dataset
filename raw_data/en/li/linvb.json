Crystal healing is a type of therapy that involves restoring balance and equilibrium to various areas of your life. Sometimes, this can involve a treatment session with a crystal healer, or a practice you engage in yourself. Throughout a healing session, crystals are placed on the body to align with chakra points. It's likely that the healer may choose specific stones to help alleviate certain symptoms in the body. You can also carry crystals on your person, wear them as jewellery, place them under your pillow or on your nightstand to protect your energy. As different stones have their own properties, the crystals that you choose may reflect areas of your life you're looking to focus on. Can crystals be used as a medical alternative? Finally, while the use of crystals can be a source of support, it's important to be aware that crystals shouldn't be used as an alternative to professional medical treatment. So, if you or a friend are struggling with physical or mental health, know that support is always out there. Remember to always reach out if you have symptoms that concern you. How do you charge crystals? There are numerous ways you can cleanse and charge crystals to activate their healing properties; however, this depends on the type of stone, so it's always worth researching your crystals. Although, some will not take well to water or salt, so be mindful of this before choosing a method of charging. Apart from this, choosing your preferred method comes from your own intuition and whichever you feel most drawn to. Cleansing and charging your stones is key. Crystals are said to absorb energy, however, this also includes negativity too. Here are five popular methods you can try to cleanse and charge your collection of crystals, most of them involving nature.
