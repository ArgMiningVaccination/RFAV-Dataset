Here's what happened New York real estate developer Arnold Fisher had a vision that the U.S. military should heal injured troops \u2014 even the \"invisible wounds\" of the brain \u2014 before they are discharged. What became a $100 million private fundraising drive is now manifesting at Camp Pendleton. On Tuesday, Navy medical officers ceremonially broke ground on the seventh of nine Intrepid Spirit centers nationwide that are meant to address the trauma inflicted on the brain by blast injuries. \"Science as a whole remains in the infancy of its understanding of the potential for recovery after head injury,\" said Capt. Lisa Mulligan, commanding officer of the Camp Pendleton naval hospital. \"This center will combine the resources of clinical, research and educational specialists to broaden our horizons.\" The $12.5 million facility, expected to take a year to build, will bring to bear the state-of-the art in traumatic brain injury care that's based on seven years of work at the National Intrepid Center of Excellence in Bethesda, Maryland. The Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund built that center in 2010 to tackle research and diagnosis of brain injuries and psychological health conditions among returning troops. The same charity, led by the Fisher family, is building the 25,000-square-foot facility next to Camp Pendleton's main hospital. Like the others, it will be donated to the Defense Department upon completion. More than 356,000 U.S. service members have been diagnosed with some level of brain injury during the Iraq and Afghanistan war era. Traumatic brain injury, or TBI, occurs when an external mechanical force \u2014 like a blast or strong jolt \u2014 causes brain dysfunction. Many people who get it also develop post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. Arnold Fisher said he views it as a duty to address the brain and psychological issues that he sees as tied to the 20-a-day suicide rate among America's veterans. \"When they come home, and they have mental problems, we need to take care of them immediately,\" said Fisher, 84, who spoke at Tuesday's ceremony and a panel discussion afterward. \"We can't let them have this malady for which they could shoot themselves, beat up on their families and do things they would never have done before. It's very important that we catch this and fix this as soon as they return,\" he added. The Intrepid centers boast a \"cure\" rate as high as 94 percent. Also, they've cut opioid painkiller use by 50 percent among people who start out on these habit-forming prescription medications. The \"cure\" rate is really a return-to-duty rate, said Capt. Walter Greenhalgh, director of the national Intrepid center in Bethesda. It's hard to compare that to the early years of the post-9/11 wars because the nation, including military medicine and Congress, started paying good attention to brain injuries only a decade ago, Greenhalgh said. \"You talk about signature injuries of the war \u2014 obviously they are amputations and burns. But it's actually the signature mechanism, which is blast, that has created these injuries,\" he said. \"So it stands to reason that if blast is the mechanism, the effect on the brain and the nervous system \u2014 there has to be an association there as well.\" At Camp Pendleton, more than 1,743 patients have been referred to the concussive care unit since 2014. That unit will be transferred to the new Intrepid Spirit center and expanded upon. Research supports a multi-disciplinary approach to treating brain and psychological afflictions, officials said Tuesday. That means experts located together in one site to address different parts of the injury, in addition to trying things such as yoga, acupuncture and animal therapy. Even the look and feel of the Intrepid Spirit centers are different, officials said. At military bases full of squared-off buildings, the centers feature softer facades with rounded corners. Inside, the paint and furniture schemes are designed to make people comfortable. There's also an intangible benefit derived from the bricks and mortar, Greenhalgh said. \"It's really been the first major step to bring visibility to the invisible wounds of war,\" he said. \"To have a monument, essentially, to these injuries I think really has done than anything to destigmatize what has been an invisible wound.\" The first two Intrepid Spirit centers were built at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, and Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. They were followed by Kentucky's Fort Campbell, Fort Hood in Texas and North Carolina's Fort Bragg. Another is being built at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state. The final two are planned for Fort Carson in Colorado and Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas. The Fisher family is also behind the Fisher House Foundation, which provides housing for families visiting injured troops, and the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York. The Fallen Heroes fund also led fundraising for the Center for the Intrepid at San Antonio's Brooke Army Hospital, which focuses on care for Iraq and Afghanistan troops suffering from lost limbs and burns. Symptoms of traumatic brain injury Physical - Headache - Feeling dizzy - Being tired - Trouble sleeping - Vision problems - Feeling bothered by noise and light Mental - Memory problems - Trouble staying focused - Poor judgment and acting without thinking - Being slowed down - Trouble putting thoughts into words Emotional - Depression - Anger outbursts and quick to anger - Anxiety - Personality changes These symptoms are part of the normal process of getting better. They are not signs of lasting brain damage and are not a cause for concern. More serious symptoms include severe forms of those listed above, decreased response to standard treatments and seizures.
