Who i s my d esignated e thics s upervisor (DES)? Every board or commission subject to the Ethics Act 1 has several ethics supervisors designated by statute: The chair serves as DES for board or commission members. The chair serves as DES for the executive director. The executive director serves as DES for the staff. The governor is the DES for a chair.2 What do I have to d isclose? The Ethics Act requires members of boards and commissions to disclose: Any matter that is a potential conflict of interest with actions that the member may take when serving on the board or commission. Any circumstance that may result in a violation of the Ethics Act. Any personal or financial interest (or that of an immediate family member) in a state grant, contract, lease or loan that is awarded or administered by the member's board or commission. The receipt of certain gifts. The executive director of the board or commission and its staff, as state employees, must also disclose: Compensated outside employment or services. Volunteer service, if any compensation, including travel and meals, is paid, there is a potential conflict with state duties. For more informatio n regarding the types of matters that may result in violations of the Ethics Act, board or commission members should refer to the guide, \"Ethics Information for Members of Boards and Commissions.\" The executive director and staff should refer to the guide, Ethics Information for Public Employees.\" Both guides and disclosure forms may be found on the Department of Law's ethics website: http://www.law.state.ak.us/doclibrary/ethics.html . 1 The Act covers a board, commission, authority, or board of directors of a public or quasi -public corporation, established by statute in the executive branch of state government. 2 The governor has delegated the DES responsibility to Shawn Henderson, Administrative Director of the Office of the Governor. THE STATE OF ALASKA MIKE DUNLEAVY GOVERNOR Page 8 of 367www.boards.alaska.gov/resources boards@alaska.gov Ethics Act FAQ Page 2 of 5 How do I avoid violations of the Ethics Act? Make timely disclosures! Follow required procedures! Provide all information necessary for a correct evaluation of the matter!3 When in doubt, disclose and seek advice! Follow the advice of your DES! What are the disclosure p rocedures for board and commission m embers? The procedural requirements for disclosures by members are set out in AS 39.52.220 and 9 AAC 52.120. One goal of these provisions is to help members avoid violations of the Ethics Act. The procedures provide the opportunity for members to seek review of matters in advance of taking action to ensure that actions taken will be consistent with the Act. Procedure for declaring actual or potential conflicts. Members must declare potential confl icts and other matters that may violate the Ethics Act on the public record and in writing to the chair. Disclosure on the public record. Members must identify actual and potential conflicts orally at the board or commission's public meeting in advance of participating in deliberations or taking any official action on the matter. A member must always declare a conflict and may choose to refrain from voting, deliberations or other participation regarding a matter 4. If a member is uncertain whether partici pation would result in a violation of the Act, the member should disclose the circumstances and seek a determination from the chair. Disclosure in writing at a public meeting. In addition to an oral disclosure at a board or commission meeting, members' disclosures must be made in writing. If the meeting is recorded, a tape or transcript of the meeting is preserved and there is a method for identifying the declaration in the record, an oral disclosure may serve as the written disclosure. Altern atively, the member must note the disclosure on the Notice of Potential Violation disclosure form and the chair must record the determination. Confidential disclosure in advance of public meeting. Potential conflicts may be partially addressed in advance of a board or commission's public meeting based on the published meeting agenda or other board or commission activity. 3 You may supplement the disclosur e form with other written explanation as necessary. Your signature on a disclosure certifies that, to the best of your knowledge, the statements made are true, correct and complete. False statements are punishable. 4 In most, but not all, situations, refraining from participation ensures that a violation of the Ethics Act does not occur. Abstention does not cure a conflict with Page 9 of 367www.boards.alaska.gov/resources boards@alaska.gov Ethics Act FAQ Page 3 of 5 A member identifying a conflict or potential conflict submits a Notice of Potential Violation to the chair, as DES, in advance of the public meeting. This written disclosure is considered confidential. The chair may seek advice from the Attorney General. The chair makes a written determination, also confidential, whether the disclosed matter represents a conflict that will result in a violation of the Ethics Act if the member participates in official action addressing the matter. 5 If so, the chair directs the member to refrain from participating in the matter that is the subject of the disclosure. An oral report of the notice of potential violation and the determination that the member must refrain from participating is put on the record at a public meeting. 6 Determinations at the public meeting. When a potential conflict is declared by a member for the public record, the following procedure must be followed: The chair states his or her determination regarding whether the member may participate. Any member may then object to the chair's determination. If an objection is made, the members present, excluding the member who made the disclosure, vote on the matter. Exception : A chair's determination that is made consistent with advice provided by the Attorney General may not be overruled. If the chair, or the members by majority vote, determines that a violation will exist if the disclosing member continues to participate, the member must refrain from voting, deliberating or participating in the matter.7 If the chair identifies a potential conflict, the same procedures are followed. If possible, the chair should forward a co nfidential written notice of potential violation to the Office of the Governor for a determination in advance of the board or commission meeting. If the declaration is first made at the public meeting during which the matter will be addressed, the members present, except for the chair, vote on the matter. If a majority determines that a violation of the Ethics Act will occur if the chair continues to participate, the chair shall refrain from voting, deliberating or participating in the matter. A written dis closure or copy of the public record regarding the oral disclosure should be forwarded to the Office of the Governor for review by the chair's DES. 5 The chair must give a copy of the written determination to the disclosing member. There is a determination form available on the Department of Law's ethics web page. The ethics supervisor may also write a separate memorandum. 6 In this manner, a member's detailed personal and financial information may be protected from public disclosure. 7 When a matter of particular sensitivity is raised and the ramifications of continuing without an advisory opinion from the Attorney General may affect the validity of the board or commission's action, the members should consider tabling the matter so that an opinion may be obtained. Page 10 of 367www.boards.alaska.gov/resources boards@alaska.gov Ethics Act FAQ Page 4 of 5 Procedures for other member d isclosures A member's interest in a state grant, contract, lease or loan and receipt of gifts are disclosed by filling out the appropriate disclosure form and submitting the form to the chair for approval. The disclosure forms are found on the Department of Law's ethics website: http://www.law.state.ak.us/doclibrary/ethics.html What are the disclosure p rocedures for e xecutive d irectors and s taff? Ethics disclosures of the executive director or staff are made in writing to the appropriate DES (chair for the executive director and the executive director for staff). Disclosure forms are found on the ethics website, noted above. Notices of Potential Violations. Following receipt of a written notice of potential violation, the DES investigates, if necessary, and makes a written determination whether a violation of the Ethics Act could exist or will occur. A DES may seek advice from the Attorney General. If feasible, the DES shall reassign duties to cure a potential violation or direct divestiture or removal by the employee of the personal or financial interests giving rise to the potential violation. These disclosures are not required to be made part of the publi c record. A copy of a determination is provided to the employee. Both the notice and determination are confidential. Other Disclosures. The DES also reviews other ethics disclosures and either approves them or determines what action must be taken to avoid a violation of the Act. In addition to the disclosures of certain gifts and potential conflicts of interest, state employees must disclose all outside employment or services for compensation. The DES must provide a copy of an approved disclosure or ot her determination to the employee. How are t hird party reports of p otential violations or complaints h andled? Any person may report a potential violation of the Ethics Act by a board or commission member or its staff to the appropriate DES or file a complaint alleging actual violations with the Attorney General. Notices of potential violations and complaints must be submitted in writing and under oath. Notices of potential violations are investigated by the appropriate DES who makes a written determination whether a violation may exist. 8 Complaints are addressed by the Attorney General under separate procedures outlined in the Ethics Act. These matters are confidential, unless the subject waives confidentiality or the matter results in a public accusation. 8 The DES p rovides a copy of the notice to the employee who is the subject of the notice and may seek input from the employee, his or her supervisor and others. The DES may seek advice from the Attorney General. A copy of the DES' written determination is provided to the subject employee and the complaining party. The DES submits a copy of both the notice and the determination to the Attorney General for review as part of the DES' quarterly report. If feasible, the DES shall reassign duties to cure a potential violation or direct divestiture or removal by the employee of the personal or financial interests giving rise to the potential violation. Page 11 of 367www.boards.alaska.gov/resources boards@alaska.gov Ethics Act FAQ Page 5 of 5 What are the procedures for q uarterly r eports? Designated ethics supervisors must submit copies of notices of potential violations received and the corresponding determinations to the Attorney General for review by the state ethics attorney as part of the quarterly report required by the Ethics Act. Reports are due in April, July, October and January for the preceding quarter. A sample report may be found on the Department of Law's ethics website . An executive director may file a quarterly report on behalf of the chair and combine it with his or her own report. If a board or commission does not meet during a quarter, and there is no other reportable activity, the DES shall advise Jenn Williams by e -mail at Jennifer.williams1@alaska.gov and no other report is required. If the state ethics attorney disagrees with a reported determination, the attorney will advise the DES of that finding. If the ethics attorney finds that there was a violation, the member who committed the violation is not liable if he or she fully disclosed all relevant facts reasonably necessary t o the ethics supervisor's or commission's determination and acted consistent with the determination. How d oes a DES or b oard or c ommission get ethics advice? A DES or board or commission may make a written request to the Attorney General for an opinion regarding the application of the Ethics Act. In practice, the Attorney General, through the state ethics attorney, also provides advice by phone or e - mail to designated ethics supervisors, especially when time constraints prevent the preparation of timely written opinions. A request for advice and the advisory opinion are confidential. The ethics attorney endeavors to provide prompt assistance, although that may not always be possible. The DES must make his or her determination addressing the potential violation based on the opinion provided. * * * * * It is the obligation of each board or commission member, as well as the staff, to ensure that the public's business is conducted in a manner that is consistent with the standards set out in the Ethics Act. We hope this summary assists you in ensuring that your obligations are met. Page 12 of 367www.boards.alaska.gov/resources boards@alaska.gov Ground Rules Boards and Commissions Office of the Governor 550 W 7th Ave. Suite 1700 Anchorage, Alaska 99501 907-269-0006 Ground Rules for Successful Meetings Thank you for volunteering to serve Alaska, as a designee of the State, on behalf of the Office of the Governor. The simple, yet effective, rules below serve as a set of expectations to keep board and commission meetings productive and respectful. Most important, the consistent use of the cornerstones of Robert' s Rules builds the public's trust and reflects positively on all involved. 1. Everyone participates. As the Chair, encouraging the full participation of team members allows your support staff and the public to have a clear understanding of everyone's view of the issue at hand. Call on quiet team members , as they may only need a clarification or an explanation. 2. Different opinions are welcome, but the board must stay on track. The Chair helps guide the team to places of agreement, so the discussion should focus on areas that need clarification, legal advice, or further vetting. Keep the discussion on track or you may find yourself in the middle of a disagreement in which there are no winner s and no productive actions. 3. Limit s ide conversations. A quick question or clarification is one thing, but it can be disconcerting when whispered conversations are held between members of the board during an open meeting. It does nothing to encourage trust between the board and the public, and the Chair should not allow it. 4. Re-state the motion and clarify amendments. This is a simple way for the Chair to be sure that everyone on the team is on the same page as you move through the process. It also gives support staff the opportunity to clarify the language or intent if needed. It can be surprising how often people are halfway through an argument before they realize they didn't have a clear understanding of the motion or amendment before them. As a member of the board or commission, don't hesi tate to ask for clarification if you are unsure. 5. Hold team members accountable. If a board member is interrupting others, rude to staff, or refusing to keep their comments on track, the Chair should call for a brief at ease and address it with them directly. Honest mistakes or over- eagerness can be quietly corrected at a break, but deliberate bad behavior by anyone should never be tolerated by the Chair. 6. Listen respectfully and thoughtfully to p ublic testimony. Remember that the public has an important role in the process. They have given their time and effort to be heard, and the issue at hand is probably very important to them personally. If testimony gets heated, the Chair can always call for an at ease so that tempers can cool. 7. Cell phones off. Ringing phones are annoying, but texting someone in the audience or another board member during the meeting is disconcerting and secretive. This does not encourage trust between the team members themselves or the public. 8. Speak clearly. When before the public, always speak so that they can hear you. You may not have a good sound system to amplify your voice, so speak loudly and clearly. THE STATE OF ALASKA MIKE DUNLEAVY GOVERNOR Page 13 of 367www.boards.alaska.gov/resources boards@alaska.gov OMA Page 1 of 8 Boards and Commissions Office of the Governor 550 W 7th Ave. Suite 1700 Anchorage, Alaska 99501 907-269-0006 Open Meetings Act The State of Alaska's Open Meetings Act (AS 44.62.310-.312) requires that all meetings of a public entity's governing body be open to the public and that the body provide reasonable notice of its meetings. The Open Meetings Act (OMA) is intended to ensure that decisions made and actions taken are public knowledge and represent the will of the public that the governing body serves. In essence, the OMA protects the public's right to know. To be able to protect the public's right to know, the OMA requires that: all deliberations and action taken by a public entity must be done in public view, with limited exceptions; the public must be provided prior knowledge of all steps occurring in the decision -making process, with limited exceptions; and that individual actions of an official are made known. In order for these requirements to have full effect, meetings must occur as provided in the notice; and, with few exceptions, the public must be allowed to involve itself in the meeting. The public must also have access to materials being considered during the meeting. In addition to laying out specific steps required for meetings and allowable exceptions, the statutes addressing open meetings speak about the state's policy regarding what authority the public has delegated to governing bodies. Following is a synopsis. According to the 'State Policy Regarding Meetings' (AS 44.62.312): The government exists to aid in conducting the people's business. Government units should act and deliberate openly. The people do not yield sovereignty to government agencies that serve them. Public servants have not been given the right to decide what is good or not good for the people to know. People should remain informed so they may retain control over the government they created. The use of teleconferences is for the convenience of the parties, public, and government. The Open Meetings Act should be narrowly construed to effectuate these policies and avoid unnecessary exemptions. What is the Open Meetings Act? The State of Alaska's Open Meetings Act (AS 44.62.310-.312), is a law that addresses the meetings of public entities; it protects the public's right to know and their opportunity to be heard. Among other things, the Act: defines public meetings and public entities; lays out specific requirements for public notice; requires that all meetings of a governmental body of a public entity are open to the public; lays out provisions for attendance at meetings and voting methods; lays out provisions for distribution of meeting materials; and lists the few exceptions to the Act, as well as matters that may be discussed in executive session. In order to assure that the public information/participation provisions of the Act are met, the A ct requires that the public entity must provide \"reasonable\" notice that meets the requirements of the Act. To meet these notice requirements, the notice must: be provided within a reasonable amount of time prior to the meeting; include the date, time, and place of the meeting; be posted at the principal office of the public entity, in addition to any other methods and locations stated in local ordinance; and be done in the same way each time (consistent). THE STATE OF ALASKA MIKE DUNLEAVY GOVERNOR Page 14 of 367www.boards.alaska.gov/resources boards@alaska.gov OMA Page 2 of 8 What is the definition of a meeting that would fall under the provisions of the Open Meetings Act? AS 44.62.310(h) provides detailed definitions of \"governmental body,\" \"meeting,\" and \"public entity\" that, when combined, define what constitutes a public meeting. The Act makes a distinction between what constitutes a meeting of a policy/decision- making body and what constitutes a meeting of an advisory-only body. A meeting of a decision - or policy- making body occurs when more than three members , or a majority of the members, whichever is less, engage collectively in discussion of a subject that the body is authorized to act and set policy on and is therefore subject to the Open Meetings Act. Under this definition, it doesn't matter where the meeting occurs, if it was prearranged, or who arranged it and could include unplanned casual or social contact. A meeting of an advisory-only body is a prearranged gathering to consider a matter on which the entity is authorized to advise and assist the decision -making body and is subject to the provisions of the Act. The A ct doesn't specify a number, so two or more members, if the gathering is prearranged for the purpose of conducting any business of the entity, could constitute a meeting. What types of meetings might be conducted that would require notice under the Open Meetings Act? Following are the most common types of meetings that would be subject to the Open Meetings Act: Regular Meetings: State law requires that the governing body conduct its business at regularly scheduled meetings that are open to the public. Regular meetings must be held at least once a month and may be held more often, as required or established in local ordinance. The local code of ordinances should provide the date, time, and place of regular meetings so that everyone knows when regular meetings will take place. The public shouldn't have to wonder about the meeting time, date, and place always changing. If at times it is necessary to reschedule the regular meeting, notice must be posted informing the public that the regular meeting has been rescheduled and when it will be held. Special Meetings : Special meetings have the same requirements as regular meetings, except that they are called for a different time than that fixed for regular meetings. For example, local ordinance may require that the governing body hold its regular meeting on the third Tuesday of each month at 7:00 PM at the municipal offices. If the governing body must meet earlier, it can call a special meeting for a different date. The special meeting does not take place instead of the regular meeting, it is in addition to the regular meeting. Special meetings should be held rarely and only to address time sensitive issues. A special meeting may be held with less than 24-hour's notice if all members are present or if absent members have waived in writing the required notice. Waiver of notice can be made before or after the special meeting is held. Emergency Meetings: Emergency meetings are held to address situations that are so urgent that the governing body must meet right away. An emergency meeting may be held if a majority of the members are given at least 24 hours oral or written notice and reasonable efforts are made to notify all members. Committee Meetings: Permanent (\"standing\") committees and temporary (\"ad hoc\") committees of the governing body may be formed to study particular issues in more detail. Standing committees may include the finance committee, public works committee, and/or a facilities committee. Ad hoc committees are formed to address a specific situation and are disbanded once the situation has been dealt with. Committees may be composed of all members of the governing body (referred to as a committee of the whole), or of fewer members, usually three. A committee cannot take action on behalf of the full governing body but instead makes a recommendation to the governing body for the governing body's action. Usually the committee of the whole meets to discuss items that are not ready for action but need further discussion in an informal setting. For example, the annual budget usually requires a work session before it is formally adopted. Board of Equalization: The governing body, or its appointees, sits as the Board of Equalization in municipalities that levy a property tax. AS 29.45.200(a) states, \"the governing body sits as a board of equalization for the purpose of hearing an appeal from a determination of the assessor.\" A property owner who believes the assessor has made a mistake in the yearly valuation of their property may appeal the assessor's decision to the board of adjustment, which meets once a year. Page 15 of 367www.boards.alaska.gov/resources boards@alaska.gov OMA Page 3 of 8 How much notice is required to meet the \"reasonable\" public notice provision of the Open Meetings Act? How much notice is required depends on the complexity of the issue and the potential effect it will have. Proper public notice must be provided in advance of the proposed action and local ordinances should state the minimum number of days that notice is required. This number should be adjusted up if the situation warrants additional notice. Special and emergency meetings require only 24-hour notice or less. If less notice is given, absent members must waive the notice requirement. Notice requirements for work sessions and committee meetings should follow the same guidelines as those established in local ordinance for regular meetings. There are minimum mandatory notice requirements for certain actions, such as notice of a public hearing on a proposed ordinance, or election notice. There is, however, no specific number of days spelled out in statute that defines \"reasonable.\" The general tone of case law on the subject has essentially found that reasonable notice provides enough notice that a concerned party will have notice of a proposed action within enough time to be involved in the deliberations. This could vary anywhere from three months to three days. The notice also has to provide enough information to let the public know what subjects will be covered in the meeting. If a complete agenda isn't available at the time of posting, a summary will work until the complete agenda is available. Local ordinances should contain all of the requirements for public notice of meetings including what to include in the notice, where the notices are posted, and how soon before the meeting the notices are posted. Where and how does notice have to occur? State law, AS 44.62.310(e), requires that reasonable notice include the date, time, and place of the meeting; and, if by teleconference, the location of any teleconferencing facilities. It also provides that notice may be given in print or broadcast media; that it be posted at the principal office of the public entity or, if no principle office, at a location designated by the governing body; and that it be done in the same way each time \"consistent.\" In addition to the locations required in statute, notice should be posted at well -used locations in the community like the post office, the store, government offices, and the community bulletin board. It may also be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the community or broadcast over a local radio station in addition to any other means and locations stated in local ordinance. Are there exceptions to the Open Meetings Act and what subjects may be discussed in executive session? Exceptions to the OMA are discussed in the Executive Session section of LOGON. Is secret ballot voting allowed under the act? Almost always, no. In additi on to requiring that deliberations of a governing body be open to the public, the act also requires that the vote shall be conducted in such a manner that the public may know the vote of each person entitled to vote, including meetings conducted by teleconference. The one exception is organizational meetings of a governing body to elect members to various offices, which are exempted from the requirement that the vote of each member be made public (AS 44.62. 310(a)). Is telephone polling considered a violation of the Open Meetings Act? Whether a phone poll by a member or agent of the governing body would be considered a violation of the act, depends on the subject matter. If the matter involves an administrative or procedural issue that would not warrant public discussion, a phone poll may be conducted. If, however, the phone poll touches on an issue that should be discussed in an open meeting or can have the effect of swaying opinion on a public issue, it could be considered a violation of the act. Who enforces the Open Meetings Act? It is the responsibility of the administration and governing body to assure that the provisions of the Open Meetings Act are enforced. Any individual may contest an action administratively through local channels that they think was done in violation of the Open Meetings Act and ultimately may, within 180 days, file a court action if the issue isn't remedied locally AS 44.62.310(f). There are several court cases that have ruled in favor of the Open Meetings Act. When deciding these cases, the court doesn't just consider whether a violation has occurred, but also considers whether the action has interfered with the public process that the act was intended to protect. Page 16 of 367www.boards.alaska.gov/resources boards@alaska.gov OMA Page 4 of 8 What is the cure for a violation of the Open Meetings Act? Actions taken at meetings that are found to be in violation of the Open Meetings Act may be voided. Failing to provide proper notice can cost a great deal of money to defend in addition to the wasted time and effort involved. The governing body can attempt an informal cure by holding another meeting in compliance with the Open Meetings Act and conducting a substantial and public reconsideration of the matters. If a lawsuit is filed, the court may void any action taken by the governing body if the court finds that, considering all of the circumstances, the public interest in compliance with the law outweighs the harm that would be caused by voiding the action AS 44.62.310(f)). In deciding whether to void an action, the court must consider: (1) the expense that may be incurred if the action is voided; (2) the disruption that may be caused if the action is voided; (3) the possibility of additional litigation if the action is voided; (4) the extent to which the subject has previously been considered in compliance with the act; (5) the amount of time that has passed since the action was taken; (6) the degree to which the action has come to be relied on; (7) whether and to what extent the governmental body has, before or after the lawsuit was filed, engaged in or attempted to engage in public reconsideration of the matter; (8) the degree to which the violations were willful, flagrant, or obvious; (9) the degree to which the governing body failed to adhere to the policy under AS 44.62.312 (a). This does not apply to an advisory only body that that has no authority to establish policies and make decisions for the public entity (AS 44.62.310(g)). What effect does attorney client privilege have in dealings between a public entity and its attorney? Executive session procedure requires that the reason for calling the executive session is clearly stated. The attorney- client privilege exemption to the Open Meetings Act is limited to matters where public interest may be injured. This might include how to avoid legal liability, litigation strategies and candid discussion of facts, a proposed settlement conference, and a conference on a decision to appeal. In addition to the rights protected under the Open Meetings Act, what rights can the public expect under state law? In addition to the rights protected under the Open Meetings Act, Title 29 reiterates the requirement that all meetings be open to the public and provides that the public will have the right to be heard at regular and special meetings AS 29.20.020. AS 29.20.160 lays out the procedures that a governing body must follow in conducting its meetings. These procedures include: Provision for identification of the presiding and deputy-presiding officers; The requirement that the governing body hold at least one regular monthly meeting, unless otherwise provided by ordinance; The requirement that the governing body shall provide at least 24-hour notice for special meetings or absent members must waive the notice requirement; Clarification on how actions of the governing body are adopted and what constitutes a quorum; The requirement that all members present shall vote on every question, unless required to abstain; and The requirement that a governing body maintain a journal of its proceedings that is available to the public. AS 29.20.380 assigns certain meeting duties and responsibilities to the municipal clerk. These include: Attendance at public meetings; Keeping the journal; Assuring that notice and other requirements for public meetings are complied with; Assuring that public records are available for public inspection; Managing and maintaining public records; and Page 17 of 367www.boards.alaska.gov/resources boards@alaska.gov OMA Page 5 of 8 Preparing agendas and agenda packets. Who enforces the local rules under which a municipality conducts its meetings? Governing bodies must have procedures in place and follow them for their meetings. Some of these procedures are in Title 29 and other statutes. Others are in the local ordinances, which are usually more specific and detailed than Title 29, or in rules of procedure adopted by the governing body. Essentially, the presiding officer enforces the rules by following them when conducting a meeting and, when there is a question of procedure, the clerk, acting as parliamentary advisor, researches the question and proposes an answer, which the presiding officer then rules on. Members of the public also enforce the rules by questioning whenever something occurs that doesn't seem to follow the rules. The last resort for enforcement is a lawsuit.

Government meetings public. (a) All meetings of a governmental body of a public entity of the state are open to the public except as otherwise provided by this section or another provision of law. Attendance and participation at meetings by members of the public or by members of a governmental body may be by teleconferencing. Agency materials that are to be considered at the meeting shall be made available at teleconference locations if practicable. Except when voice votes are authorized, the vote shall be conducted in such a manner that the public may know the vote of each person entitled to vote. The vote at a meeting held by teleconference shall be taken by roll call. This section does not apply to any votes required to be taken to organize a governmental body described in this subsection. (b) If permitted subjects are to be discussed at a meeting in executive session, the meeting must first be convened as a public meeting and the question of holding an executive session to discuss matters that are listed in (c) of this section shall be determined by a majority vote of the governmental body. The motion to convene in executive session must clearly and with specificity describe the subject of the proposed executive session without defeating the purpose of addressing the subject in private. Subjects may not be considered at the executive session except those mentioned in the motion calling for the executive session unless auxiliary to the main question. Action may not be taken at an executive session, except to give direction to an attorney or labor negotiator regarding the handling of a specific legal matter or pending labor negotiations. (c) The following subjects may be considered in an executive session: (1) matters, the immediate knowledge of which would clearly have an adverse effect upon the finances of the public entity; (2) subjects that tend to prejudice the reputation and character of any person, provided the person may request a public discussion; (3) matters which by law, municipal charter, or ordinance are required to be confidential; (4) matters involving consideration of government records that by law are not subject to public disclosure. (d) This section does not apply to (1) a governmental body performing a judicial or quasi -judicial function when holding a meeting solely to make a decision in an adjudicatory proceeding; (2) juries; (3) parole or pardon boards; (4) meetings of a hospital medical staff; (5) meetings of the governmental body or any committee of a hospital when holding a meeting solely to act upon matters of professional qualifications, privileges, or discipline; (6) staff meetings or other gatherings of the employees of a public entity, including meetings of an employee group established by policy of the Board of Regents of the University of Alaska or held while acting in an advisory capacity to the Board of Regents; (7) meetings held for the purpose of participating in or attending a gathering of a national, state, or regional organization of which the public entity, governmental body, or member of the governmental body is a member, but only if no action is taken and no business of the governmental body is conducted at the meetings; or (8) meetings of municipal service area boards established under AS 29.35.450 \u2014 29.35.490 when meeting solely to act on matters that are administrative or managerial in nature. (e) Reasonable public notice shall be given for all meetings required to be open under this section. The notice must include the date, time, and place of the meeting and if, the meeting is by teleconference, the location of any teleconferencing facilities that will be used. Subject to posting notice of a meeting on the Alaska Online Public Notice Page 19 of 367www.boards.alaska.gov/resources boards@alaska.gov OMA Page 7 of 8 System as required by AS 44.62.175 (a), the notice may be given using print or broadcast media. The notice shall be posted at the principal office of the public entity or, if the public entity has no principal office, at a place designated by the governmental body. The governmental body shall provide notice in a consistent fashion for all its meetings. (f) Action taken contrary to this section is voidable. A lawsuit to void an action taken in violation of this section must be filed in superior court within 180 days after the date of the action. A member of a governmental body may not be named in an action to enforce this section in the member's personal capacity. A governmental body that violates or is alleged to have violated this section may cure the violation or alleged violation by holding another meeting in compliance with notice and other requirements of this section and conducting a substantial and public reconsideration of the matters considered at the original meeting. If the court finds that an action is void, the governmental body may discuss and act on the matter at another meeting held in compliance with this section. A court may hold that an action taken at a meeting held in violation of this section is void only if the court finds that, considering all of the circumstances, the public interest in compliance with this section outweighs the harm that would be caused to the public interest and to the public entity by voiding the action. In making this determination, the court shall consider at least the following: (1) the expense that may be incurred by the public entity, other governmental bodies, and individuals if the action is voided; (2) the disruption that may be caused to the affairs of the public entity, other governmental bodies, and individuals if the action is voided; (3) the degree to which the public entity, other governmental bodies, and individuals may be exposed to additional litigation if the action is voided; (4) the extent to which the governing body, in meetings held in compliance with this section, has previously considered the subject; (5) the amount of time that has passed since the action was taken; (6) the degree to which the public entity, other governmental bodies, or individuals have come to rely on the action; (7) whether and to what extent the governmental body has, before or after the lawsuit was filed to void the action, engaged in or attempted to engage in the public reconsideration of matters originally considered in violation of this section; (8) the degree to which violations of this section were wilful, flagrant, or obvious; (9) the degree to which the governing body failed to adhere to the policy under AS 44.62.312 (a). (g) Subsection (f) of this section does not apply to a governmental body that has only authority to advise or make recommendations to a public entity and has no authority to establish policies or make decisions for the public entity. (h) In this section, (1) \"governmental body\" means an assembly, council, board, commission, committee, or other similar body of a public entity with the authority to establish policies or make decisions for the public entity or with the authority to advise or make recommendations to the public entity; \"governmental body\" includes the members of a subcommittee or other subordinate unit of a governmental body if the subordinate unit consists of two or more members; (2) \"meeting\" means a gathering of members of a governmental body when (A) more than three members or a majority of the members, whichever is less, are present, a matter upon which the governmental body is empowered to act is considered by the members collectively, and the governmental body has the authority to establish policies or make decisions for a public entity; or (B) more than three members or a majority of the members, whichever is less, are present, the gathering is prearranged for the purpose of considering a matter upon which the governmental body is empowered to act, and the governmental body has only authority to advise or make recommendations for a public entity but has no authority to Page 20 of 367www.boards.alaska.gov/resources boards@alaska.gov OMA Page 8 of 8 establish policies or make decisions for the public entity; (3) \"public entity\" means an entity of the state or of a political subdivision of the state including an agency, a board or commission, the University of Alaska, a public authority or corporation, a municipality, a school district, and other governmental units of the state or a political subdivision of the state; it does not include the court system or the legislative branch of state government. Sec. 44.62.312. State policy regarding meetings. (a) It is the policy of the state that (1) the governmental units mentioned in AS 44.62.310 (a) exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business; (2) it is the intent of the law that actions of those units be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly; (3) the people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them; (4) the people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know; (5) the people's right to remain informed shall be protected so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created; (6) the use of teleconferencing under this chapter is for the convenience of the parties, the public, and the governmental units conducting the meetings. (b) AS 44.62.310 (c) and (d) shall be construed narrowly in order to effectuate the policy stated in (a) of this section and to avoid exemptions from open meeting requirements and unnecessary executive sessions.

Page 1 of 6 Boards and Commissions Office of the Governor 550 W 7th Ave. Suite 1700 Anchorage, Alaska 99501 907-269-0006 Introduction to Robert's Rules of Order What is parliamentary procedure? It is a set of rules for conduct at meetings, which allows everyone to be heard and to make decisions without confusion. Why is parliamentary procedure important? Because it is a time -tested method of conducting business at meetings and public gatherings. It can be adapted to fit the needs of any organization. Today, Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised is the basic handbook of operation for most clubs, organizations, and other groups. It is important that everyone is familiar with these basic rules! Order of Business: Organizations using parliamentary procedure usually follows a fixed order of business. A typical example: 1. Call to order. 2. Roll call of members present. 3. Reading of minutes of last meeting. 4. Officer's reports. 5. Committee reports. 6. Special orders --- Important business previously designated for consideration at this meeting. 7. Unfinished business. 8. New business. 9. Announcements. 10. Adjournment. Motions: The method used by members to express themselves is in the form of moving motions. A motion is a proposal that the entire membership take action or a stand on an issue. Individual members can: 1. Call to order. 2. Second motions. 3. Debate motions. 4. Vote on motions. Types of Motions: 1. Main Motions: The purpose of a main motion is to introduce items to the membership for their consideration. They cannot be made when any other motion is on the floor, and yield to privileged, subsidiary, and incidental motions. 2. Subsidiary Motions: Their purpose is to change or affect how a main motion is handled, and is voted on before a main motion. 3. Privileged Motions: Their purpose is to bring up items that are urgent about special or important matters unrelated to pending business. 4. Incidental Motions: Their purpose is to provide a means of questioning procedure concerning other motions and must be considered before the other motion. THE STATE OF ALASKA MIKE DUNLEAVY GOVERNOR Page 22 of 367www.boards.alaska.gov/resources boards@alaska.gov Robert's Rules 11th ed. Page 2 of 6 How is a Motion Presented? 1. Obtaining the floor: a. Wait until the last speaker has finished. b. Rise and address the Chairman by saying, \"Mr. Chairman, or Mr. President.\" c. Wait until the Chairman recognizes you. 2. Make Your Motion: a. Speak in a clear and concise manner. b. Always state a motion affirmatively. Say, \"I move that we ...\" rather than, \"I move that we do not ...\". c. Avoid personalities and stay on your subject . 3. Wait for Someone to Second Your Motion. 4. Another member will second your motion or the Chairman will call for a second. 5. If there is no second to your motion, it is lost. 6. The Chairman States Your Motion: a. The Chairman will say, \"it has been moved and seconded that we ...\" Thus, placing your motion before the membership for consideration and action. b. The membership then either debates your motion or may move directly to a vote. c. Once your motion is presented to the membership by the C hairman it becomes \"assembly property \" and cannot be changed by you without the consent of the members. 7. Expanding on Your Motion: a. The time for you to speak in favor of your motion is at this point, rather than at the time you present it. b. The mover is always allowed to speak first. c. All comments and debate must be directed to the C hairman. d. Keep to the time limit for speaking that has been established. The mover may speak again only after other speakers are finished, unless called upon by the Chairman. 1. Putting the Question to the Membership : a. The Chairman asks, \"Are you ready to vote on the question?\" b. If there is no more discussion, a vote is taken. c. On a motion to move, the previous question may be adapted. Voting on a Motion: The method of vote on any motion depends on the situation and the by-laws of policy of your organization. There are five methods used to vote by most organizations, they are: 1. By Voice -- The Chairman asks those in favor to say, \"aye\", those opposed to say \"no\". Any member may move for an exact count. 2. By Roll Call -- Each member answers \"yes\" or \"no\" as his name is called. This method is used when a record of each person's vote is required. 3. By General Consent -- When a motion is not likely to be opposed, the Chairman says, \"if there is no objection ...\" The membership shows agreement by their silence, however if one member says, \"I object,\" the item must be put to a vote. 4. By Division -- This is a slight verification of a voice vote. It does not require a count unless the chairman so desires. Members raise their hands or stand. 5. By Ballot -- Members write their vote on a slip of paper, this method is used when s ecrecy is desired. Page 23 of 367www.boards.alaska.gov/resources boards@alaska.gov Robert's Rules 11th ed. Page 3 of 6 There are two other motions that are commonly used that relate to voting. 1. Motion to Table -- This motion is often used in the attempt to \"kill\" a motion. The option is always present, however, to \"take from the table\", for reconsideration by the membership. 2. Motion to Postpone Indefinitely -- This is often used as a means of parliamentary strategy and allows opponents of motion to test their strength without an actual vote being taken. Also, debate is once again open on the main motion. Parliamentary Procedure is the best way to get things done at your meetings. It will only work if you us e it properly. Most importantly, BE COURTEOUS . 1. Allow motions that are in order. 2. Have members obtain the floor properly. 3. Speak clearly and concisely. 4. Obey the rules of debate.

Topic: Board Business Brief Discussion : The board reviews reports of lost or stolen prescriptions and correspondence relating to District 7 & 8's resolution to support a standardized renewal date. The board expresses their support for this resolution. The board then reviews correspondence from G.L.O . Associates related to clinical drug trials, from Kelly DiBattista related to virtual manufacturers engaged in title models with 3PLs, and from Ashley Bolyard related to tech- to-tech and final check requirements for pharmacy technicians in the institutional setting under 12 AAC 52.235. Dr. Schaber states the gap is specifically with (a)(1)(C), which refers to use of an image to verify a prescription and the process existing within retail pharmacies only. Dr. Schaber believes this should be amended to be more inclusive of other practice settings, such as in a hospital, which relies on a bar code scanning and verification system. Mr. Henderson inquires whether the regulations allow a final check by the technician without the image or if it requires a final check by the pharmacist. The board agrees the regulation should be clarified and wishes to discuss this further during its regulations agenda item. The board reviews the draft letter to the State Medical Board prepared by Ms. Carrillo, which requests they consider amending 12 AAC 40.983(c)(11) and (d) to better align with the board's corresponding collaborative practice regulations and improve patient care access. Dr. Ruffridge requests deleting the reference to (c)(11) since pharmacists only dispense per a physician's order. He further suggests providing an example of patient care services, e.g.: test -to-treat program s. Gerald Brown requests clarification relating to a surgery center owned by a physician who leases time to other physicians for its use and whether this scenario necessitates licensure. Dr. Ruffridge refers to the definition of \"institutional facility\" in 12 AAC 52.995(a)(15) and believes the scenario described could not fall under drug room licensure since it is not included in the definition. Dr. Ruffridge suggests the licensee contact the State Medical Board since his concerns lie primarily with physicians . Ms. Carrillo adds there are likely more sites practicing as drug rooms that are not licensed as such, referring to the NABP Model Act, which includes, for example, extended care facilit ies and assisted living facilities, but which are absent from the board's definition. The board wishes to discuss this further during its regulations item. Cassandra Sanborn inquires to the board whether immunization draw -up is permitted for pharmacy tech nicians. Dr. Schaber initially comments this may fall under the definition of compounding. Dr. Ruffridge states that 12 AAC 52.230 allows technicians to engage in manipulative, non- discretionary functions. Mr. Henderson agrees technicians may perform this duty as the responsibility ultimately falls to the pharmacist -in-charge to ensure technicians are properly trained on these functions. Page 31 of 367 With nothing further on correspondence, the board reviews applications. Motion: On a motion duly made by Ashley Schaber in accordance with AS 44.62.310(c)(2) and seconded by Justin Ruffridge, the board unanimously moves to enter executive session for the purpose of discussing subjects that tend to prejudice the reputation and character of any person, provided the person may request a public discussion.

Laura Carrillo will amend the board's collaborative practice letter addressed to the State Medical Board with Dr. Ruffridge's edits for the board's review/approval and will forward the final letter to EA Natalie Norberg. Laura Carrillo will reply to Gera ld Brown related to surgery sites and its inclusion in 12 AAC 52.995(a)(15) , drug room licensure. Laura Carrillo will provide a response to Cassandra Brown related to immunization draw up per 12 AAC 52.230, pharmacy technician duties. Topic: Industry Updates Brief Discussion : AKPhA Dr. Brandy Seignemartin, Executive Director and Dr. Daniel Nelson, pharmacist -in-charge at Chief Andrew Isaac provide an update on the AKPhA's legislative efforts related to Patient Choice and PBMs. Their PBM bill aims to: Page 32 of 367 guarantee freedom of patient choice in deciding where to receive their medications guarantees patient safety and efficient access to clinician- administered drugs by eliminating the practice of white and brown bagging strengt hen procedures for pharmacies to receive full reimbursement from PBMs. The AKPhA also informs the board and the public of its February 17 -18, 2023 Annual Convention .

Ms. Carrillo addressed AS 08.80.159(b)(16), which states that the board may inspect wholesale drug distributors, outsourcing facilities, and third- party logistics providers outside of the state, adding that the board could Page 33 of 367 delegate this to the NABP through its Supply Chain Inspection. James Henderson requests more information before moving forward. The board continues to deliberate proposed changes. James Henderson suggests removing the proposal related to automated prescription drug machines installed outside the premise of institutional facilities as it was unclear as to what the public need for this change would be. The board decides that changes of interest include: removing the affidavit of moral character requirement for pharmacist applicants; repealing the 1,500 internship hour requirement for interns as this is a national standard; replacing one public member board seat with a nationally certified technician seat; clarifying the regulation of manufacturers as separate entities; clarifying the PDMP registration requirement for pharmacists; limit/restrict the practice of white/brown bagging; recognize retired pharmacists; expanding the list of prohibited terms in advertising by non- licensed entities; licensing versus registering out -of-state pharmacies; regulating Internet pharmacies; removing the salary range for its executive administrator; and requiring a national background check for pharmacists and pharmacy technicians . The board discusses which board members would lead efforts to support the board's intended changes. Dr. Schaber volunteers as the board's legislative lead and Dr. Bell volunteers as the secondary lead. Motion: N/A Recorded Votes: N/A Action Items: Laura Carrillo will reach out to the NABP for more information regarding its Supply Chain Inspection.

Topic: Ethics Disclosures Brief Discussion : Ashley Schaber: member of the AKPhA and legislative committee. Justin Ruffridge: representative- elect for district 7 state house Motion: N/A Recorded Votes: N/A Action Items: Laura Carrillo will forward the board's approved FY2023 regulations to the regulations specialist and department of law for cursory review and public comment. Laura Carrillo will work with AAG Dinegar -Milks on a draft definition for \"ownership\" and on revised professional fitness questions for the board's consideration. Topic: Regulations #1 Brief Discussion : Ms. Carrillo reviews correspondence with AAG Dineg ar and Director Chambers related to the definition of \"ownership\" and \"change of ownership.\" Ms. Carrillo provides the overview that while \"ownership\" is defined in statute, AS 08.80.480(21), as the brick and mortal place of business, this has been an area of conflict with regards to notification requirements and processing of applications resulting in ownership changes. Ms. Carrillo adds that the precedence is to operationalize a change of ownership as one that occurs at the direct parent -level, rather than the grandparent level or higher, and that it is consistent with business licensing but hasn't been codified in regulation. Ms. Carrillo states that clarifying definitions in regulations is doable and would not require changes to the authorizing statute. In survey of other states, including MN, TX, CA, and WI, Ms. Carrillo's proposed language addresses ownership at the individual, partnership, and corporate level, and establishes an employer's federal identification number (EIN) as the basis for an ownership change involving 50% or more of the beneficial interest. Ms. Carrillo seeks guidance from the board on the difference between beneficial interest, assets, stock, etc., which were included in other states' definitions, e.g.: 20% or less of a stock change. Dr. Ruffridge recommends removing reference to 20% since the proposed definition already references 50% and because an FEIN won't change in that circumstance. Page 35 of 367 Ms. Carrillo inquires about whether the board should address in regulation the scenario in which a power of attorney is involved during an ownership transaction. Dr. Ruffridge states that while the power of attorney is what allows a business to remain operational during a 6 to 12 -month transition period, it may be something that falls to the bar association since the filing of a change of ownership is typically the first step in the change of ownership process and isn't typically managed by boards of pharmacy . Dr. Ruffridge expresses agreement with the proposed definitions but states the power of attorney topic can be left out. Dr. Schaber and Mr. Henderson also express support for the proposed definitions. Dr. Schaber suggests that power of attorney matters may be understood and written elsewhere; suggesting it may not need to be in regulation. Ms. Carrillo states it can become an FAQ, if needed. Ms. Carrillo inquires whether the board would like to incorporate the ownership language suggested by Director Chambers: \"the entity having day -to-day control over the operation within the physical space in which the pharmacy is located.\" Dr. Ruffridge understands this is an attempt to tie in the statutory definition but recommends the board avoid reference to \"physical space\" as it can be confusing. The board believes this may be too limiting and expresses content with Ms. Carrillo's proposed definitions. Dr. Ruffridge inquires whether there can be a chart presented to the board so they can keep apprised of where their many regulation projects are in the regulation adoption process and requests it also be provided to the new EA. Ms. Carrillo shares her EA transition tracker, which includes a regulations section and corresponding forms update/creation section, adding that while there are 10+ steps in the adoption process, the transition tracker condenses the regulation steps into drafted, approved, public comment, adopted, and effective categories. Corresponding forms are tracked by drafted, finalized, and published categories. Ms. Carrillo states the document is hyperlinked to the corresponding regulation or form files. Dr. Schaber and Dr. Ruffridge state this is exactly what they had in mind. The board revisits the discussion on pharmacy technicians performing a final check in the hospital setting from the previous day and discusses how the workflow differs than that of a retail setting. Ms. Schaber states there is usually a 5 rights protocol (right dose, right patient, right medication, etc.). Mr. Henderson inquires whether the tech- check -tech involves two separate technicians, citing 12 AAC 52.235, which doesn't currently specify there must be two technicians involved. Dr. Bell states that in some pharmacies, one technician enters the order into the computer to input the prescription, and from there, it goes to a pharmacist for a pre- check to ensure the entry is correct and to perform a drug regimen review. From there, it would go to the fill station where a second technician would ensure it is correctly packaged. Mr. Henderson and Dr. Bell expresses concerns about a technician performing a final check, though understand the issue at hand is addressing when a technician pulls drugs in a dispensing cabinet and having another technician verify those medications are correct prior to filling. Dr. Jennifer Adams from Idaho State University College of Pharmacy shares that this pract ice is included under delegation authority of the pharmacist, so is not spelled out in statute or regulation. Dr. Adams encourages the board to be thinking about language that is irrespective of setting that would apply to any health system (e.g.: remote pharmacy, institutional setting, telepharmacy setting, etc.). Lorri Walmsley, Director of Regulatory Affairs in Arizona, shares that this practice is called technology -assisted process verification; only products that are allowed to be processed by a techni cian are those involving a barcode scan. Page 36 of 367 Off record at 10:36 a.m. for break. On record from break at 10:52 a.m. The board continued to discuss this matter, leaning in the direction of addressing the specific workflow of institutional settings, which does not typically involve an image display but does include a barcode scan. Motion: Ashley Schaber motions to approve the proposed definitions of \"ownership\" and \"change of ownership\", seconded by James Henderson, and approved unanimously, it is: RESOLVED to approve the proposed definitions for incorporation into 12 AAC 52.995. Ashley Schaber motions to approve the proposed amendment to 12 AAC 52.235(a)(1)(C) by including language addressing barcode scanning, seconded by James Henderson, and approved unanimously, it is: RESOLVED to approve the proposed amendment to 12 A AC 52.235(a)(1)(C). The board wishes to see the re- keyed version for re- approval at its February 9 -10, 2023 meeting. Recorded Votes: Justin Ruffridge James Henderson Ashley Schaber Ramsey Bell Leif Holm Action Items: Laura Carrillo will send the proposed language to 12 AAC 52.995 related to ownership, 12 AAC 52.235(a) related to pharmacy technicians with national certification, the regulations specialist and request the re- keyed version be presented to the board at its February 9 -10, 2023 meeting before being released for public comment . Laura Carrillo/the new EA will complete the regulation FAQs for the public comment notice The new EA will provide an update on the regulations/forms tracker to the board at its February 9-10, 2023 meeting.

Recorded Votes: Justin Ruffridge James Bell Leif Holm Action Items: Justin Ruffridge will submit the signed imposition of civil fine for case #2022 -000424 to Investigator Bowles. Topic: Regulations #2 Brief Discussion : The board resumes discussion on regulations, beginning with USP sections 795 and 797. Dr. Schaber acknowledges that the compounding subcommittee is tabled until 2023, but recommends the board keep the discussion going. The board then reviews proposed language related to collaborative practice agreements in 12 AAC 52.240. The board previously removed the proposed amendments from its June project due to concerns related to the physical examination requirement in the State Medical Board's corresponding regulations. Ms. Carrillo clarifies the intent of the proposed changes is to remove repetitive language already in 12 AAC 40.983 and to develop a streamlined joint application rather than having two separate applications. The board supports the proposed language. Ms. Carrillo inquires whether the board is interested in pursuing accreditation for board meeting attendance for licensees to use towards CE requirements. Dr. Schaber expresses support for this idea, adding it would be a great way to increase participation. Dr. Schaber addresses temporary licensure for uniformed service members, recalling from previous discussions that this was an area brought to the board's attention following public comment around expedited military licensure. The board supports amendments to make 12 AAC 52.105 more inclusive of other uniformed service members. Mr. Henderson suggests there are more uniformed service members other than the C oast Guard or P ublic Health Service. Dr. Schaber pulled a comprehensive list, which includes NOAA. Dr. Ruffridge states the Space Force is also included. Motion: Ashley Schaber motions to approve the proposed amendment to 12 AAC 52.240 related to collaborative practice agreements, seconded by James Henderson, and approved unanimously, it is: RESOLVED to approve the proposed amendments to 12 AAC 52.240 .

PDMP Updates Inspection changes Describing how regulations have moved forward to align with best practices and to align with efficiency Questions & Answer Ms. Carrillo provides the board an update on the renewal rate, sharing that as of 11/10/2022, 80% of the board's licensees have renewed. Approximately 112 licensees have been randomly selected for audit of continuing education activity. Ms. Carrillo also shares the opportunity to integrate the licensing system, Portal, with the NABP's e-Profile, stating the integration would result in document retrieval efficiencies for continuing education certificates, inspection reports, examination scores, etc. This is an ongoing project which has support from division leadership but may take time as the Office of Information Technology ( OIT) works on other priority projects. Dr. Schaber inquires about the status of online initial applications for pharmacists. Ms. Carrillo shares that the publications unit is beginning to prioritize these, beginning with programs fully staffed and not in renewal. Since the Board of Pharmacy is no longer in renewal, Ms. Carrillo is hopeful they will be worked on in the coming weeks or months.

Beginning with former NABP President Fensky's 2020 initiative around MOU D, NABP has advocated for the passage of the MAT Act to reduce barriers to obtaining MOUD in order to address the opioid epidemic and improve public health. Removing this extra layer of federal bureaucracy will have two major impacts: reducing burden on providers who currently prescribe buprenorphine and reducing barriers for new providers to treat patients with OUD. 1) Reduce burden on prescribers who currently prescribe buprenorphine: under the DATA waiver requirement, practitioners wishing to prescribe buprenorphine had to apply for a waiver with the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), complete additional training, and could only prescribe to a certain number of patients. With the removal of the waiver, this will no longer be required. However, in conjunction with the MAT Act, Congress passed the Medication Access and Training E xpansion (MATE) Act, which will require practitioners prescribing controlled substances to complete a one-time training on substance use disorder. 2) Reduce barriers for new providers to treat patients with OUD : the federal law requiring the DATA waiver explicitly outlined which practitioners are allowed to apply for the waiver. In recent years, Congress expanded that list to include Nurse Practitioners (NPs), Physician Assistants (PAs), Clinical Nurse Specialists (CNSs), Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNAs), and Certified Nurse-Midwifes (CNMs). However, pharmacists are not currently on the list, regardless of states' interest in allowing pharmacists to prescribe buprenorphine in certain circumstances. Removal of the federal waiver will allow states and boards to regulate this clinical practice, as they do other clinical practices, and allow pharmacists to practice as they see fit. Thus, NABP and many other public health organizations applaud the passage of this legislation . In addition, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Drug Enforcement Administrati on (DEA) have issued statements of support.

Guarantees f reedom of patient choice of pharmacy. This bill bars Pharmacy Benefits Managers (PBMs ) from funneling patients to PBM -approved pharmacies that are often owned by or affiliated with the PBM. 2. Guarantees patients safe and efficient access to clinician- administered drugs. This bill enhance s patient wellbeing and safety. The PBM practice s of \"white bagging \" and \"brown bagging\" are potentially unsafe and impos e barriers between patients and their healthcare providers. At issue are expensive drugs \u2014like infusion cancer drugs \u2014that clinicians prepare and administer directly to patients in a clinical setting . PBMs often bar hospital and clinical pharmacies from filling prescriptions on- site to treat patients. Instead, PBMs require prescriptions be sent to external, PBM -selected pharmac ies who ship the drug to the patient's provider, who then must store the drug until the patient arrives for treatment (\"white bagging\" ). Or worse, PBMs require the drug to be shipped to the front porch of the patient who then must then retrieve, store, and carry the drug to the clinic for treatment (\"brown bagging\"). In these situations, clinical pharmacies cannot ensure the efficacy of the drug's source, dosage, or handling in transit . As such, providers can't guarantee they will have the drug when needed or that it will be safe and effective when they receive it . This bill bar s insurers and PBMs from requiring white or brown bagging. It also authorizes the Board of Pharmacy to regulate these practices. 3. Puts an end to other objectionable PBM practices by bringing them within the Alaska Unfair Trade Practi ces and Consumer Protection Act. This bill will ensure that a PBM may not: reimburse a ny pharmacy less than the PBM reimburses its own affiliate d pharmacies ; impose unequal copayment s, fee s or condition s for those of the same benefit category; \"steer\" patients to PBM -affiliated pharmacies using penalties, benefits or personal dat a; restrict patient s to only mail- order or PBM -affiliated pharmac ies; prohibit a network pharmacy from shipping or delivering drugs to its patients; require undue credentialing standards or fees from pharmacies as a condition of joining a PBM network; enga ge in \"spread pricing,\" i.e. , collect more for a drug from an insurer than the PBM reimburses to the pharmacy (and pocketing the difference) bar a network pharmacist from informing a patient when a drug is available cheaper for cash than it is by using the PBM's insurer's plan 4. Provides pharmacies a shot at fair reimbursement from PBMs . Pharmacies buy drugs from wholesalers and must recover their costs from PBMs. But PBMs use their own proprietary 'black box' formulas that often limit recovery to a level below a pharmacy's actual cost , short -changing pharmacies. This bill requires reimbursement at an objective and transparent standard: the 'national average drug acquisition cost,' continually updated by CMS survey. It also balances appeal procedures so pharma cies have a meaningful opportunity for fair reimbursement from PBMs. [end] Page 59 of 367Original Investigation | Health Policy Estimating Savings Opportunities From Therapeutic Substitutions of High-Cost Generic Medications Mariana P. Socal, MD, PhD; Thomas Cordeiro, RPh; Gerard F. Anderson, PhD; Ge Bai, PhD, CPA Abstract IMPORTANCE Use of generics is generally understood as a cost-saving practice. However, pharmacy benefit managers have an incentive to place higher-priced generic drugs on insurers' drug formularies to profit by creating a large difference between the price negotiated with pharmacies andthe price paid by insurers (what is known as spread pricing). OBJECTIVE To examine price differentials and savings potential between high-cost generics and corresponding therapeutic alternatives of same clinical value and lower cost. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional analysis examined the top 1000 generics in Colorado's all-payer claims database (CO-APCD) in 2019. High-cost generics and lower-cost generic therapeutic alternatives of same clinical value constituted the study sample. Data wereanalyzed from January 2019 to December 2019. EXPOSURES Generic drug prices measured by transaction prices, average wholesale price (AWP), and national drug acquisition average cost (NADAC). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Price differentials between the high-cost generics and the corresponding therapeutic alternatives. Levels of discounts and savings that could be achieved if thehigh-cost generics had been substituted by their therapeutic alternatives. RESULTS This cross-sectional study of the top 1000 CO-APCD generics identified 45 high-cost products that had lower-cost therapeutic alternatives of same clinical value. Overall, high-costgenerics were 15.6 times more expensive than their therapeutic alternatives (median values). If thelower-cost alternatives had been used, total spending would have been reduced from $7.5 million to$873 711, resulting in 88.3% savings. Most substitutions (28 of 45 [62.2]%) involved different dosageforms or different strengths of the same drug and provided mean (SD) discounts of 94.9% ( 3.8%) and 77.1% (19.9%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, replacing high-cost generics with lower-cost alternatives of same clinical value would produce savings of nearly 90%. Plan sponsors should beaware that some generics are associated with higher spending and should periodically review thespecific products driving their generic drug spending. Substitution of high-cost generics may providea simple pathway to offer the same therapeutic benefit at lower cost to patients and insurers.

Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) have an incentive to place higher pricedgeneric drugs on the formulary because these drugs allow PBMs to profit by creating a largedifference between the price negotiated with pharmacies and the price paid by insurers (what isknown as spread pricing). 3,4 Generic substitution laws, present in most states, incentivize the substitution of a branded product for its generic, but when there are multiple generics available for the same drug, these lawsdo not necessarily promote the use of the less expensive generic. 5In addition, the highest cost generic may have a different strength, dosage form, or different active ingredient than a lower-costgeneric option. Substitutions between products of different active ingredient, different strength, ordifferent dosage form may not be performed by a pharmacy without a new prescription from ahealth care practitioner. Like many states, Colorado has been attempting to lower drug spending for several years. 6,7 This study examined the price differentials and savings potential between high-cost generics andtherapeutic alternatives of same clinical value and lower cost among the top-1000 generics inColorado's all-payer claims database (CO-APCD). The CO-APCD congregates health insurance claimsinformation for commercial health insurance plans, Medicare, and Medicaid, and represents themajority of covered lives in the state. 8 Although generics typically account for a low percentage of prescription drug spending, substitution of high-cost generics by lower-cost generic options may represent an easy-to-implement savings opportunity. This is especially important for state payers, who face limitedbudgets and have ever-increasing costs from branded products and new technologies. Although thisstudy focuses on Colorado, the findings are likely to be similar in other states because genericmanufacturers set their prices nationally. Method Data and Sample This cross-sectional study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies inEpidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline. 9The study did not fulfill criteria for human participants research and institutional review board approval was not sought in accordance with 45 CFR \u00a746. Weanalyzed the 1000 generic drugs with the highest total spending (plan plus patient) in 2019 in theCO-APCD. Drugs were identified by their National Drug Code (NDC). The information available in theCO-APCD is submitted by health insurers and includes pharmacy claims data. 10,11The total spending on each generic, the number of claims, and the number of units of each drug dispensed in 2019 wasobtained from the CO-APCD aggregated at the drug level. No patient or claims data were included inthis study. We identified therapeutic alternatives for high-cost generics through an automated examination of pricing data in a hierarchical fashion (Table 1). First, the price of the high-cost genericwas compared with the price of the same drug from different manufacturers\u2014that is, drugs with thesame active ingredient, dosage form, and strength but that are produced by different firms(multisource products). Next, we compared the price of the high-cost generic with the price of drugswith the same active ingredient but with a different strength or dosage form (eg, substituting a200-mg tablet for 2 tablets of 100 mg or substituting a capsule for a tablet). Finally, we compared theprice of the high-cost generic with the price of all other drugs in the same therapeutic class (eg, 2different opioids). The drugs in the same therapeutic class did not have the same active ingredient asJAMA Network Open | Health Policy Estimating Savings Opportunities From Therapeutic Substitutions for High-Cost Generic Medications JAMA Network Open. 2022 01/20/2023 Page 61 of 367the high-cost generic, but they had the same mechanism of action and were approved for the same indication(s). Comparisons were implemented using the classification provided in the Medi-Span drug database.12All pairs where the high-cost generic had a higher price than the therapeutic alternative(s) were manually reviewed by 2 of the authors (T.C. and M.S.) to assess their clinicalpotential for therapeutic substitution. Potential disagreements were resolved by consensus. Whenmultiple lower-cost therapeutic alternatives of the same type were available, all the alternatives wereincluded in the sample. The drug pairs where the high-cost generic had higher price than thealternative(s) and where the high-cost generic and the therapeutic alternative(s) were assessed bythe authors to have comparable clinical value constituted the study sample (eTable in theSupplement). The US Food and Drug Administration's Orange Book of Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations 13and NDC database14were used to identify the number of manufacturers for each drug, which was available for 42 of the 45 pairs in our sample. For all high-cost generics and therapeutic alternatives, we collected 3 sets of price metrics. First, we collectedtransaction prices using the CO-APCD to obtain the price for the high-cost generics and using aproprietary database that congregates a similar mix of private and public payers to obtain the priceof the therapeutic alternatives. 15Next, we collected Average Wholesale Prices (AWP) from Medi-Span12and National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC) from Medicaid.gov.16These databases did not contain rebate information, but, unlike branded drugs, generic prices are notinfluenced by manufacturer rebates. 17All metrics reflected the last available unit price recorded for each NDC as of December 31, 2019. Statistical Analysis We compared prices between high-cost generics and therapeutic alternatives using transactionprices at the unit level (price per tablet or capsule or per milliliter). When needed, prices wereadjusted to reflect how many units of the therapeutic alternative would produce the sametherapeutic effect as 1 unit of the high-cost generic. Therefore, if 2 tablets of the therapeuticalternative were required to substitute for 1 tablet of the high-cost generic, the price of thetherapeutic alternative was multiplied by 2. Price differentials were calculated as the ratio betweenthe unit price of the high-cost generic and the mean unit price of the therapeutic alternative(s),adjusted for dosage requirements as needed. Discounts were calculated as the difference betweenthe price of the high-cost generic and the mean price of the therapeutic alternative(s) (adjusted fordosage requirements as needed), divided by the price of the high-cost generic.

All Pvalues were 2-tailed and were set at a critical significance level of 5%. We estimated the potential savings that could be accrued if the high-cost generic had been substituted by its therapeutic alternatives by applying the percentage discount offered by the therapeutic alternatives to the spending on the high-cost generic according to the CO-APCD,assuming that all patients using the high-cost generic would switch to the therapeutic alternative.When multiple therapeutic alternatives were identified for the same drug, we assumed that an equalproportion of people would switch to each alternative. This aimed to account for the fact that, whenmultiple lower-cost therapeutic alternatives offer the same clinical value, insurers might choose tocover any or all of them in their formularies, according to therapeutic preferences or to favorabledeals from manufacturers. We implemented sensitivity analyses to check the robustness of the results by using 2 price metrics\u2014AWP and NADAC\u2014to estimate price differentials and potential savings resulting from theproposed therapeutic substitutions. AWP prices were available for all drugs in our sample. NADACprices were available for 35 pairs (35 high-cost generics and 50 therapeutic alternatives). There wereno other missing values. All analyses were implemented using Stata statistical software version 15(StataCorp). 18Data were analyzed from January 2019 to December 2019. Results Overview of Drugs and Therapeutic Substitutions Among the 1000 generics with the highest spending in the CO-APCD, a total of 45 drugs (4.5%) wereidentified as having 64 lower-cost generic therapeutic alternatives, comprising the 45 pairs in thestudy sample. The 45 high-cost generics represented 4% of CO-APCD's on ($7.5 million). Most high-cost generics with lower-cost therapeutic alternatives (13 drugs)were systemic treatments for pain, followed by topical agents (7 drugs), systemic antibiotics (6drugs), antidepressants (6 drugs), and antidiabetic agents (4 drugs) (eTable in the Supplement). Most substitutions (28 of 45 [62.2]%) involved different dosage forms or different strengths of the same drug. The most common type of substitution identified was for the same drug with adifferent dosage form, which comprised 17 pairs (7345 overall claims [26.3%]) ( Table 2). Substitutions for different drugs in the same therapeutic class represented 15 pairs and 7553 claims(27.1%); substitutions for the same drug with a different strength represented 11 pairs and 9891claims (35.5%); and substitutions for the same drug from a different manufacturer represented 2pairs and 3090 claims (11.1%). A total of 34 out of the 45 pairs (77.8%) had only 1 therapeuticalternative identified, 3 pairs (6.7%) had 2 alternatives, 5 pairs (11.1%) had 3 alternatives, and 2 pairs(4.4%) had 4 therapeutic alternatives (eTable in the Supplement). Most pairs with more than 1 therapeutic alternative represented substitutions for different drugs in the same therapeutic class. Table 2.

This was significantly lower than the number of manufacturers recorded for therapeutic alternatives (mean of 12.3 manufacturers; 95% CI, 10.3-14.3 manufacturers; P< .001), and mainly associated with substitutions for the same drug in a different dosage form andsubstitutions for a different drug in the same therapeutic class. On average, cheaper therapeuticalternatives in these categories had about twice as many manufacturers as the high-cost generics. Discounts and Price Differentials Overall, the price of high-cost generics was 15.6 times higher than the price of the therapeuticalternatives (median values) (Table 3). Therapeutic alternative prices had a mean of an 87% discountfrom the price of the high-cost generic. A total of 32 of the 45 drug pairs had discounts of more than Table 3.

Under both AWP and NADAC, the therapeuticalternative was less expensive than the high-cost generic in all the pairs inour sample.JAMA Network Open | Health Policy Estimating Savings Opportunities From Therapeutic Substitutions for High-Cost Generic Medications JAMA Network Open. 2022 From: https://jamanetwork.com/ on 01/20/2023 Page 64 of 36790% and 9 pairs had discounts between 50% and 90%. Only 4 pairs had discounts of less than 50% (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Generics substituted by different drugs in the same therapeutic class had 20.6 times higher prices than their therapeutic alternatives, and generics substituted by the same drug with a differentdosage form had 20.2 times higher prices than their therapeutic alternatives (median values). Thesedifferences demonstrate that the ability to charge higher prices is greater when the formulation ofthe high-cost generic product is more differentiated from its therapeutic alternatives. The lowestprice differential was between the same drugs from different manufacturers, which have nodifferentiation. These drugs had a mean (SD) of 1.4 (0.9) times higher prices than their alternatives. Similarly, the highest discounts offered by the therapeutic alternatives were among substitutions for the same drugs of different dosage forms (mean [SD] discount of 94.9% [3.8%])and different drugs in the same therapeutic class (mean [SD] discount of 93.9% [4.9%]); and thelowest discounts were among substitutions for the same drug from a different manufacturer (mean[SD] discount of 23.5% [21.4%]). Substitutions for the same drug from different strength provided amean (SD) discount of 77.1% (19.9%). Would-Be Spending Under Full Generic-Generic Therapeutic Substitution Colorado payers spent a total of $7.5 million on the 45 high-cost generics in our study in 2019(Table 3). If all drugs had been fully substituted by their alternatives, the total spending on thesedrugs would have been reduced to $873 711, resulting in 88.3% savings. Most of the savings would beconcentrated among substitutions for the same drug with a different dosage form ($2.9 million[43.8%]) and drugs in the same therapeutic class ($2.57 million [38.8%]). Drugs with the highestspending tended to have the highest savings (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). Sensitivity Analysis Results from the robustness checks using AWP and NADAC were qualitatively in line with the primaryanalysis using CO-APCD prices. Using AWP, the price of the therapeutic alternatives represented adiscount of 64.2% compared with high-cost generics (Figure). Using NADAC, the discount was85.6%. This number was closer to the estimates we obtained using transaction prices, likely becausethe NADAC more closely reflects transaction prices. Keeping utilization constant at 2019 CO-APCD levels, at AWP prices the total spending on the 45 drugs in our sample would have been $13.4 million. Spending on therapeutic alternatives would havetotaled $4.8 million, representing $8.6 million savings. At NADAC prices, total spending on the 35drugs with available information would have been $3.5 million, and would-be spending ontherapeutic alternatives would have been $0.51 million, representing about $3 million savings. Discussion Among the top 1000 generics in Colorado's commercial health insurance plans, Medicare, andMedicaid programs, this cross-sectional study identified 45 high-cost generics that had lower-costgeneric therapeutic alternatives. Overall, high-cost generics were 15.6 times more expensive thantheir therapeutic alternatives (median values). Colorado payers and patients spent a total of $7.5million on these 45 high-cost generics in 2019. If the lower-cost alternatives had been used instead,total spending would have been reduced by 88.3%, resulting in approximately $6.6 million savings. Most substitutions (62%) involved different dosage forms or different strengths of the same drug. Such substitutions provided, on average, discounts of 94.9% and 77.1% off the high-costgeneric's price, respectively. Such substitutions cannot be implemented by the pharmacy without amedical prescription. Therefore, such substitutions require a change in the plan's formulary toprioritize lower cost but similarly effective therapeutic alternatives. Multisource products may be substituted by the pharmacy without the need for a new medical prescription and, therefore, exert direct price competition on each other. Drugs with a differentJAMA Network Open | Health Policy Estimating Savings Opportunities From Therapeutic Substitutions for High-Cost Generic Medications JAMA Network Open. 2022 From: https://jamanetwork.com/ on 01/20/2023 Page 65 of 367strength, dosage form, or active ingredient, however, may not be substituted by the pharmacy without a new medical prescription and do not pose direct price competition on one another. Generic manufacturers may choose to produce different forms of a drug to prevent substitution at thepharmacy. High-cost generics tended to have fewer manufacturers than their lower-cost therapeutic alternatives, which is in line with findings from previous studies. 19A higher number of manufacturers has been associated with lower generic prices, and a drug with more manufacturers is assumed torepresent a market with greater competition 20However, high-cost generics still had more than 5 manufacturers on average. This finding suggests that, even though these markets should be wellfunctioning, generics can maintain higher prices when pharmacies cannot directly substitute them bya cheaper alternative. It is important that plan sponsors acknowledge that high generic drug utilization is not a guarantee of lower spending. Plans typically aim for high generic dispensing rates as a measure ofcost containment. 21However, plan sponsors should be aware that some generics are associated with higher spending and that therapeutic alternatives could offer substantial savings. Substitution ofhigh-cost generics may provide a simple pathway to offer the same therapeutic benefit at lower costto patients and insurers, with discounts reaching 80% or more. It should not be difficult for plans to identify the additional spending associated with high-cost generics. Unlike branded drugs, generic prices are not influenced by manufacturer rebates. 17 However, generic reimbursement rates are usually defined by maximum allowable costs (MAC) lists, which may not be disclosed to plan sponsors. MAC lists may allow for more favorable reimbursementof high-cost generics to enable greater spread pricing. 22Although we could not examine the decision-making process behind the coverage decisions that added high-cost generics to planformularies, it is possible that high-cost generics may offer increased revenue for PBMs throughspread pricing. 23 The alternative price metrics that we examined, especially NADAC, may provide helpful alternatives to plan sponsors willing to reexamine their drug formularies. AWP is a price benchmarkoften used as a basis for generic drug pricing negotiations. 24The study findings suggest that AWP may provide an alternative pricing metric to identify generic drug targets for therapeuticsubstitutions, even if the magnitude of potential savings might vary. NADAC prices more closelyapproximated the level of discount estimated from transaction prices. However, NADAC was notavailable for all drugs, which could potentially limit its use as a tool to guide plans' analyses. Limitations The main limitation of this study is that manufacturers may change prices any time, and potentialsavings may vary when prices change. In aggregate, generic drug prices have tended to decreaseover time. However, approximately 30% of generic drugs have experienced extraordinary price increases in recent years, including frequently used drugs such as atenolol and captopril, and suchincreases have been long-lasting, without downward movement in subsequent years. 25 It is possible that other states or payers may be able to negotiate better prices on certain drugs. However, generic manufacturers set prices nationwide, and the CO-APCD data combines data from all payers, including nationwide insurers and the Medicare program. Therefore, the results will mostlikely apply to payers in other states. In addition, the robustness checks using different price metricssuggest that substitutions would yield savings in most cases, even if the magnitude of those savingsmight vary. Because generics typically account for a low percentage of prescription drug spending, 26 savings from generic-generic substitutions are likely to be lower than savings from substitutions ofhigh-cost drugs, such as biologics and biosimilars. Nevertheless, generic-generic substitutionsrepresent an easy-to-implement savings opportunity. This is especially important for states, whichface growing pharmaceutical costs and increasingly constrained budgets.JAMA Network Open | Health Policy Estimating Savings Opportunities From Therapeutic Substitutions for High-Cost Generic Medications JAMA Network Open. 2022 From: 01/20/2023 Page 66 of 367Additionally, the therapeutic substitutions that we proposed may not be fully achievable. Some patients may hesitate to switch drugs, particularly those who have been taking a particular medication long term or when changing a generic has perceived differential effects\u2014for example, awithin-class change of proton pump inhibitors or antimigraine triptans. Substitutions may be easierto implement for new users. By including all the available therapeutic alternatives for each high-costgeneric, we provided a comprehensive but conservative estimate of the potential savings. Also,PBMs may resist making changes to drug formularies, especially if the drug to be substitutedprovides large spread prices and high profits. Conclusions Rather than serving as a prescriptive analysis of which drugs should or should not be covered in drugformularies, this study provides an evidentiary basis to suggest that insurers and plan sponsorsshould review their drug formularies for savings opportunities and that those reviews should includegeneric drugs. In addition, our findings support keeping close scrutiny of drugs with fewermanufacturers. The savings estimated in this study may represent a lower bound of attainablesavings, because additional tools such as utilization controls restricting access to certain productscould be implemented when spending on high-cost generics is identified. Future avenues forresearch include examining whether the estimated savings from generic substitution that weidentified in this study would differ under different sample selection criteria or across payer type.

Contracted by plan sponsors (including government program s, self- insured employers and insurance companies ) to negotiate on their behalf with pharmaceutical companies, these \"middlemen \" corporations have quietly become an unavoidable part of our nation's health care system. Today, fewer than five PBMs control more than 80 percent of drug benefits for over 260 mi llion Americans, which includes the power to negotiate drug costs, what drugs will be included on plan formularies, and how those drugs are dispensed. Oftentimes, patients are required to receive drugs through PBM -owned or affiliated specialty and mail -order pharmacies and suffer serious, sometimes dangerous, and even deadly, impact of their abuses as a result of medication delays and denials . However, while the role PBMs play in the U.S. health care system is complex and under scrutiny by both federal and state policymakers and the public , it is increasingly becoming clear that PBMs make up an oligopoly of rich, vertically integrated conglomerates that routinely prey on health care practices, providers, and their patients. PBMs have done this by overwhelmin gly abusing their responsibility to protect Americans from this country's drug pricing crisis, instead exploiting the opacity throughout the nation's drug supply chain to enrich themselves. Unfortunately, their impact is only becoming more pronounced, esp ecially in the world of cancer care . More and more cancer medications are coming out in oral formulations, resulting in a shift away from the medical benefit and into the pharmacy benefit . And because cancer medications are among the most expensive out there, they are very attractive to PBMs because they yield higher rebat es, high er \"DIR fees, \" and other pricing gimmicks that yield substantial profits. Through vertical integration and sheer market power , PBM s have also been able to creep into other areas of our health care system , such as injectable biosimilars and intravenous chemotherapies. Not only can PBMs leverage these products for steep originator drug rebates (thereby stifling the biosimilar industry for their own gain), but PBMs have also begun to inst itute policies such as mandatory \"white bagging \" to take the in-office administration out of the hands of patients' oncologists . The purpose of this expos \u00e9 is to reveal and explain PBM s' advantage and leverage by providing transparency where now there is total darkness , and by delving into the many ways that PBMs have abused their power. This report comprehensively explores and documents the myriad of PBM abuses, and their impact on patient care - focusing especially on cancer care. It explores how the recent levels of consolidation among PBMs and health insurers is adversely impacting cancer care, fueling drug costs, all while allowing for massive profits for PBM s and health insurance companies. E xamining the most pervasive and abusive PBM tactics, each section highlights the adverse impact of PBMs on patients, health care payers (including Medicare, Medicaid, employers , and taxpayers), and providers, while also detailing potential solutions. Each day that goes by, physicians , practices , and most importantly, patients become increasingly powerless because of horizonal PBM consolidation and vertical integration with insurers. The result is a system designed for patients to receive inferior treatment, while paying more out -of-pocket for their medications . The time for sitting back and hoping for PBMs to become good faith actors is over. It is time for action to stop PBM abuses once and for all, and this expos \u00e9 provides a road map for tackling them one dirty PBM trick at a time. Page 74 of 367 February 2022 5 2 Introduction In the eyes of many Americans, the problem with drug pricing is caused by unscrupulous pharmaceutical manufacturers who have increased drug prices over the last two decades with reckless abandon. This has been exemplified by a handful of highly visible bad actor s, such as \"pharma -bro\" Martin Shkreli or Nostrum Pharmaceuticals founder, Nirmal Muyle, who rightfully captured the public's attention, but wrongfully over -simplified the causes of our nation's drug pricing issues . Far more dangerous and insidious actor s have quietly grown to dominate the nation's pharmaceutical industry and drive high drug price s through the secretive pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) industry. Ironically, in th e country's attempt to rein in ruthless operators like Shkreli and Muyle, we ended up inadvertently creating the PBM problem that now plagues us . Expanding the role of PBM s, first from simple processors of pharmacy claims to middlemen more actively managing the prescription benefit initially made some sense. Clients - employers, unions, state governments, and other payers of medical care - did not have the expertise to manage complex drug benefits. Thus, they could hire a PBM to administer their prescription benefit, which would include simplifying and streamlining a complicated drug supply chain, designing formularies to exclude wasteful drugs, using their size and leverage to negotiate better discounts from pharmaceutical manufacturers , and managing pharmacy networks to create better outcomes for patients. However, as this expos \u00e9 on PBM business tactics, dirty tricks, and their negative impact s will detail, what seemed like a good idea \"on paper\" has not come to fruition. Instead, the nation's largest PBMs have capitalized on the complexity of the drug supply chain and used the secrecy i n which they operate to hide the true cost of drugs. And r ather than eliminate the costly arbitrage within the supply chain, PBMs co- opted and embraced it, exacerbat ing the very problems of high drug prices that they were originally hired to control. They saw the financial windfall that would come through vertical integration and bought or set up their own mail -order and specialty pharmacies, steering patients away from independent community pharmacies and medical practices to their wholly -owned or affiliated pharmacy facilities where they could retain the inflated prices (and profits) they themselves were responsible for creating. The perverse result is that PBMs have abandoned their most sacrosanct function of protecting their clients from high cost or low benefit drugs, instead letting higher priced drugs \"buy\" their way onto their clients ' formularies via rebates that the PBMs mostly retain . They then set up affiliated rebate aggregator entities to further obfuscate the flow of pharmaceutical manufacturer dollars, retaining a larger portion of their clients' rebate s, and leaving patients on high deductible plans exposed to drugs with exploitative list prices. The result is that patients pay more for their drugs off of artificially inflated list prices and the PBM clients have higher prescription drug costs. The PBM's purpose in the drug supply chain was to \"police\" the system. Had the largest PBMs not been lured in by the immense profit potential borne out of th e complete opacity of drug costs, a PBM's greatest asset would have been trust - trust from payers and providers that they were tirelessly working to protect the American public from high drug pric es. However, this unfortunately did not come to pass. Instead, the PBM's greatest advantage has become the almost total opacity of the U.S. drug supply chain and a lack of understanding among employers , unions, state governments, and American taxpayers of how most PBMs have chosen to abuse it. The purpose of this expos \u00e9 is to reveal and explain the PBM advantage by providing transparency where now there is total darkness and delving into the many ways that PBMs have abused their power to become \"crooke d cops.\" Throughout this expos\u00e9 , we comprehensively explore and document the myriad of PBM abuses, and their impact on patient care - focusing especially on cancer care. Finally, we explore how the Page 75 of 367 February 2022 6 recent levels of consolidation among PBMs and health insurers is adversely impacting cancer care, fueling drug costs, while allowing for massive profits for PBM and health insurance companies. We have thoroughly examined and detailed the most pervasive and abusive PBM tactics, in each section highlighting their adverse impact on patients, health care payers (including Medicare, Medicaid, employers and taxpayers), and providers. With the ultimate goal of this expos \u00e9 being transparency, Frier Levitt went beyond the law, partnering with 3 Axis Advisors LLC to create infographics derived from their analysis of millions of prescription claims across multiples states. The goal of these infographics is to help crystallize and simplify the very complex topics we will discuss throughout this expos \u00e9. Lastly, because PBMs have been known to hold themselves out as being \"above the law,\"1 we have provided the applicable law and legal principles governing each topic, and detailed the PBMs' thin legal footing as it comes to these abusive practices. Finally, we have laid out potential, workable solutions to these issues, which may be legislative, regulatory, or legal in nature. We intend for this report to serve as an authoritative source and reference guide for federal and state policymakers , regulators, and employers seeking greater understanding of PBM behavior, as well as frameworks for reshaping the industry for the better . While not all PBMs engage in these types of practices, or the degree with which they engage in these practices may vary from plan to plan, program to program, state to state, and so on, we believe that a thorough exposure of the blind spots, latitude fo r abuse, and backwards incentives is essential for any coherent understanding of the inherent flaws within the drug supply chain. This expos \u00e9 was commissioned by the Community Oncology Alliance (COA).

If this expos \u00e9 is reproduced, we ask that it be reproduced in its entirety, as pieces taken out of context can be misleading. 3 Background 3.1 The Stakeholders Any examination of the PBM industry must necessarily begin with an overview of the relevant stakeholders. These include five major categories of industry participants: (1) plan sponsors, (2) health insurers, (3) patients , (4) manufacturers, ( 5) providers, and ( 6) PBMs . Understanding who the major stakeholders are, and their relationship with one another, is paramount. At the top of the hierarchy are plan sponsors. These include governmental health benefits programs (such as Medicare, Medicaid an d TRICARE), employer -sponsored health plans, Taft -Hartley and union welfare plans, and private health insurance companies. These entities sponsor a health benefits plan for their members, beneficiaries or employees, and provide coverage for pharmacy expen ses and drug costs (in addition to traditional medical expenses) . In the Medicare Part D context, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) contracts with private insurance companies that submit bids to become Part D plan sponsors, and CMS in tu rn subsidizes certain costs associated with the operation of the plans.2 Likewise, in the Medicaid space, the majority of states operate a managed care model with respect to pharmacy benefits, contracting with Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (MCOs), who in turn, contract with PBMs to administer the pharmacy benefit.3 Finally, in the private sector, employers either directly or 1 See, CZ Servs. v. Express Scripts Holding , Case No. of 367 February 2022 7 through an insurance company contract with PBMs to administer pharmacy benefits. These employer - spons ored plans may either be fully -insured (meaning the employer hires an insurance company and pays all or part of the premiums on behalf of its employees) or self -insured (meaning the employer bears all of the financial risk with the costs of care).4 In an y case, these plan sponsors bear the ultimate costs of care, and suffer when PBM abuses cause prices to rise or waste to occur. Plan sponsors may or may not hire a health insurance company to help offset the risks associated with the cost of care, and pay premiums on behalf of their beneficiaries. These health insurance companies may in turn be the entity that directly contracts with the PBM for pharmacy care. However, as noted below, the lines have become increasingly blurred between health insurers and PBMs; thus, the key distinction between plan sponsors and health insurers is that the plan sponsors are t ypically the ultimate financial guarantors of the costs of the health care for their beneficiaries, including not only drug costs but also major medic al expenses . At the other end of the continuum are the p atients . Patients include beneficiaries of government sponsored health care programs, as well as the employees (and dependents) of employers sponsoring health plans. They are also uninsured or under insured individuals who are left to find a way to cover drug costs themselves. In oncology, they are cancer patients needing care from a complex and disjointed health care system. As a group, they not only bear a disproportionate share of the out -of-pocket costs associated with PBM abuses, but also suffer from the inferior care caused by certain PBMs' tactics of putting profits over patients. These include delays and denials as a result of PBMs' unnecessary obst acles to care. On the front line of care are the p roviders . These include retail, specialty and mail -order pharmacies, and in oncology , community oncology pr actices. In addition to providing direct medical care, community oncology practices provide in -office and outpatient pharmacy services, which can take two basic forms (depending on applicable state law): dispensing physician practices (i.e., in -office dispensing under a plenary medical license), or oncolog ist-owned pharmacies (i.e., the oncology pract ice owns and operates a licensed retail pharmacy within the clinic ).5 These providers contract with PBMs to dispense medication to plan members, and participate in PBM networks. In so doing, they are tasked with providing appropriate care to their patients, while remaining bound to the PBMs who set reimbursement rates and ot her terms for participation. While not directly involved in the provision of care, m anufacturers are equally part of the continuum and impacted by PBM actions. These include drug and biologic manufacturers, including both brand and generic companies . Man ufacturers have had a particular important role in the biosimilar market , becoming captive to PBMs' rebate traps, and stifling the biosimilar market before it even has a chance to take hold. The final piece of the puzzle is the PBM . PBMs are third -party a dministrators of prescription drug programs covered by a plan sponsor. The PBM is primarily responsible for processing and paying prescription drug claims submitted by participating providers on behalf of covered beneficiaries. However, a PBM's role is not limited to processing and paying prescription drug claims. Ra ther, PBMs also provide bundled services related to the administration of pharmaceutical benefits, including formulary design, formulary management, negotiation of branded drug rebates, and controlling network access of participating pharmacies. Perhaps mo st importantly, PBMs often also own and operate their affiliated retail, mail -order and/or specialty pharmacies, and in so doing, directly compete with independent providers participating in PBM networks. They are not just the gatekeepers, but also competi tors operating in the same marketplace. This blatant conflict of interest has serious consequences. Finally, as the result of consolidation and vertical 4 https://www.shrm.org/hr -today/news/hr -magazine/pages/0909wellsc.aspx 5 See Mark Munger et al., Emerging Physician Dispensing, Presentation to the Nat'l Ass'n of Bds. of Pharmacy (May 20, 2014), available at https://www.nabp.net/system/rich/rich_files/rich_files/000/000/338/original/munger -202.pdf. Page 77 of 367 February 2022 8 integration within the marketplace, virtually all of the major PBMs have merged with, acquired or bec ome acquired by health insurers, greatly blurring the lines between insurer and PBM. As a result, health insurers and PBMs are often referred to jointly as \"payers.\" Figure 1. The Pharmacy Benefits Landscape The Figure 1, above, visually demonstrates th e different stakeholders, and their relationship with one another. 3.2 Consolidation of PBMs and Health Insurers , and the Resulting Influence on Recent PBM Actions PBMs traditionally have played a critical role in the administration of prescription drug programs. However, over the past ten years, the PBM marketplace has transformed considerably. Changes include both horizontal and vertical integration among health insurance companies, PBMs, chain pharmacies, specialty pharmacies , and long -term care pharmacies. As a result, a smaller number of large companies now wield nearly limitless power and influence over the prescription drug market. Within the PBM marketplace , over 80% of the covered lives in the United States are controlled by only five PBMs.6 As a result of this concentration, a pharmacy's access to these five PBM network s is critical . Being out of network with just one PBM (which in some regions, could make up more than 85% of the market), and being unable to obtain reimbursement for claims dispensed to those patients, could make it financially unviable for any community oncology pra ctice to provide dispensing services at all . The lack of competition in the marketplace stems , in large part , from a series of mergers, integrations , and consolidations. Th ese consolidation s and integration s are undoubtedly a factor in many abusive PBM pra ctices, ranging from seeking to exclude independent providers, to reimbursement rates that force providers to lose money by filling prescriptions, to outright diver sion of patients to the PBMs' wholly -owned or affiliated pharmacies. The consolidation incr eases the market power of the top PBMs, which makes this possible. 6 See https://w ww.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la -fi-hiltzik -drugs -20170611 -story.html Page February 2022 9 The breadth of PBM power did not arise overnight . It began with a series of vertical consolidations in which some PBMs acquired pharmacies and other PBMs acquired insurance companies. In 2 007, the shareholders of Caremark Rx, one of the nation's largest PBMs at the time , approved a $26.5 billion takeover of CVS Pharmacy, which effectively created the first vertically integrated retail pharmacy and PBM.7 Vertical integration of the industry continued in 2011 , as Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina, one of Medco's largest customers, began shifting its PBM business away from Medco to Prime Therapeutics ,8 a PBM that is wholly owned by a group of thirte en Blue Cross plans across the country. In 2012 , UnitedHealthcare (United), the nation's largest insurance company, began migrating the administration of its plans from Medco Health Solutions to OptumRx, United's wholly -owned PBM.9 Consolidation of the PBM and pay er space has not been limited to vertical integration. In 2011, two of the nation's then -largest PBMs - Medco Health Solutions, Inc. and Express Scripts, Inc. - announced a $29 billion merger. After a contentious regulatory approval process, t he Federal Trade Commission ultimately approved the merger in 2012.10 Thereafter, the industry continued consolidation both horizontally and vertically. In 2013, a regional PBM - SXC Corporation - agreed to buy another regional PBM - Catalyst, Inc. - for $ 4.4 billion to form a national PBM, known as Catamaran Corp.11 In July 2015, Catamaran was acquired by United, OptumRx's parent company, for $12.8 billion. The two PBMs are now integrating operations and operate under one name, OptumRx. In 2015, Rite Aid acquired the PBM EnvisionRx for approximately $2 billion.12 Later that year, Walgreens announced its intention to acquire Rite Aid and EnvisionRx for $9.4 billion.13 Also in 2015, Aetna, the nation's third largest insurer, announced its intention to acquire Humana, the nation's fourth largest insurer, as well as Humana's wholly -owned PBM, Humana Pharmacy Solutions , for $37 billion.14 Finally, in 2015 , Anthem announced its agreement to buy Cigna (including its PBM arm) for $48 billion, which would resu lt in, yet again, fewer players in the space.15 However, on July 21, 2016, the Justice Department filed 7 Evelyn M.

PBM Mergers and Consolidations in Last Ten Years 2011 2013 2015 2022 Unfortunately, the last five years has only seen this trend of consolidation and integration expand at an exponential rate. In November 2018, CVS Health completed a controversial $69 billion acquisition of Aetna, a managed health care company that special izes in selling traditional and consumer -directed health insurance along with related services including dental, vision, and disability plans. Not to be outdone, in December 2018, health insurer Cigna acquired Express Scripts for $54 billion.17 Since that time, Cigna and Express Scripts have continued to expand in creative ways. In December 2019. Express Scripts and Prime Therapeutics announced a three -year collaboration agreement, whereby Express Scripts would take over the contracting and administration of the pharmacy benefits for Prime Therapeutics' members.18 As a 16 Leslie Picker, U.S. Sues to Block Anthem -Cigna and Aetna -Humana Mergers , N.Y.

Vertical Integration of PBMs and Health care Conglomerates This rapid evolution of the PBM and health insurance industry shows how a limited number of corporations wield an outsized level of control and influence in the prescription drug coverage marketplace. Fewer payers spells harm to patients , especially cancer patients. These integrated companies have greater abilities to control the nature and direction of patients' care, including what type of care/drugs they receive, from who m they receive it , and in what setting they are treated. The leve l of PBM intrusion into the care received by patients borders on the practice of medicine by these PBMs and health insurance conglomerates. Fewer payers also results in harm to plan sponsor s, especially employers sponsoring health plans, who have fewer choices based on decreased competition. This hits small employers the hardest, who lack the overall leverage and resources to either demand competitive rebates or restructure entrenched PBM pr actices . Fewer pay ers also exponentially increases the importance of network access for providers. Exclusion from one PBM with a market share of 35% means that the provider loses out on a major portion of the patient population . 19 https://www.primetherapeutics.com/en/news/pressreleases/2019/release -prime -express -scripts - collaboration.html Page 81 of 367 February 2022 12 Figure 4. Market Share b y PBM in U.S. Prescription Benefits Market in 201820 As can be seen in the figure above, consolidation has created merged entities that have oppressive power . This creates a virtual chokehold note only on community oncology practices and pharmacy providers , but on plan sponsors and patients alike. It is through this market dominance that PBMs are able to get away with their abuses. Whether it is outsized rebates and DIR fees fueling drug prices . Whether it is unreasonable barriers to entry, network exclusions or mandatory white bagging forcing patients to receive inferior service at higher costs . Whether it is employing insidious copay accumulator programs or deceptive pricing and reimbursement technique s. Or worse yet, whether it is essentially practic ing medicine, through \"fail first\" step therap y, prior authorization requirements, or f ormulary exclusions , many of which favor not the least expensive medication , but the most profitable one for the PBM . Each of these tactics are made possible by the PBMs' sheer levels of dominance at all levels of the health care continuum. This consolidation has hurt medical care, while fueling both drug prices and costs to patients and plan sponsors alike. While the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Department of Justice (DOJ) Antitrust Division recently embarked on a process to rewrite vertical merger guidelines, this effort is seen by many as coming \"too little, too late.\"21 Providers , patients and plan sponso rs have long realized that the vertical integration between payer -PBM -provider would spell disaster for quality and freedom of choice.22 Dramatic and urgent action is necessary to curtail this wide ranging abuse of power. 20 Exhibit 76 in The 2019 Economic Report on U.S. Pharmacies and Pharmacy Benefit Managers, Drug Channels Institute . Available at 4 Manufacturer Rebates , Rebate Aggre gators , and the \"Gross -to-Net Bubble \" It is axiomatic to say that the PBM market is highly concentrated, with three companies (i.e., CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, and OptumRx) covering nearly 80 percent of the market, or 180 million American lives. As a result, pharmaceutical and biosimilar manufacturers face exceedingly high stakes when negotiating for formulary placement.23 Among the different sources of revenue, the most prolific by far i s in the form of rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers that PBMs extract in exchange for placing the manufacturer's product drug on a plan sponsor's formulary or encouraging utilization of the manufacturer's drugs.24 Rebates are mostly used for high -cost brand -name prescription drugs where there are interchangeable products and aim to incentivize PBMs to include pharmaceutical manufacturers ' drugs on plan sponsors' formularies and to obtain preferred tier placement.25 While drug prices are too high, ironically , the growing number and scale of rebates is the primary fuel of today's high drug prices. The truth is that PBMs have a vested interest to have drug prices remain high, and to extract rebates off of these higher prices. PBM formularies tend to favor drugs that offer higher rebates over similar drugs with lower net costs and lower rebates.26 23 See, Bai, G., A.P. Sen, and G.F.

Gross -to-Net Bubble Apart from increasing costs today, these destructive practices will have a long -lasting impact on the future of health care and drug innovation. Traditionally, generic drugs offer significant price relief for brand medications; however, there are an ever -growing subset of medications that are unlikely to e ver have a traditional generic alternative. As a result, federal policy was enacted to create eventual competition for these brand products such as the biosimilar pathway. However, the PBMs' practice of maximizing rebates may effectively neuter the nation' s biosimilar market before it even gets off the ground. Unlike traditional drug products, biologics are unique and complex molecules, and represent many of the new breakthrough treatments that have come to market over the past ten years. But with such br eakthrough comes extremely high cost. As a result, biosimilars - that is, products that are \"highly similar\" to the reference biologic27 - have emerged to provide alternatives and competition in the biologics space. The first biosimilar product in the Un ited States was approved in March 2015 and marketed in September 2015.28 The greater use of biosimilars has the potential to reduce the overall drug spending, while providing greater 27 US Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Center for Biologics Evaluation an d Research (CBER).

As a result, PBMs have begun to market themselves as transparent and assert that many of their cust omers are able to negotiate \"pass -through pricing\" allowing pharmaceutical manufacturer rebates and other concession s to flow directly to plan sponsors.35 However, a dangerous new trend has grown exponentially over the last few years through which PBMs se ek to \"circumvent\" these pass -through requirements. PBMs have increasingly \"delegated\" the collection of manufacturer rebates to \" rebate aggregators,\" which are often owned by or affiliated with the PBMs, without seeking authorization from plan sponsors a nd without telling plan sponsors.36 Sometimes referred to as rebate GPOs, these mysterious entities include Ascent Health Services, a Switzerland -based GPO that Express Scripts launched in 2019, Zinc, a contracting entity launched by CVS Health in the sum mer of 2020 , and Emisar Pharma Services , an Ireland -based entity recently rolled out by OptumRx .37 Even some of the major PBMs (i.e., the \"Big Three\" PBMs) sometimes find themselves contracting with other PBMs' rebate aggregators for the collection of man ufacturer rebates (for example, in the case of OptumRx contracting with Express Scripts for purposes of rebate aggregation for public employee plans) .38 29 See, James D.

The deleterious effects of rebates, and the furtive work of rebate aggregators, are felt across the health care spectrum. 4.1.1 Harm to Patients Whether a patient has insurance or not, rebates serve to increase the overall costs of drugs and out -of- pocket expenditures for patients.43 With one in four people in the United States having difficulty paying the cost of their prescription medications,44 the extent of the negative impact of rebates is felt far and wide. For uninsured patients, the rebates negotiated by a PBM or health insurance company do nothing to lower their out -of-pocket costs. Rebates promote high drug list prices. \"Higher drug prices hurt uninsured patients who pay list prices ... based on drugs' list prices.\"45 And because these rebates are received and kept among secretive health care conglomerates, and not shared with providers or other groups, even https://www.broward.org/Auditor/Reports/Documents/2017_1212%20Agenda%20Review%20of%20Pharmacy%20 Benefit%20Management%20Services%20by%20St oneBridge/2017_1212%20Exh1_OptumRx.pdf 39 See, Office of Broward County Auditor, \"Audit of Pharmacy Benefit Management Services Agreement,\" 2017, accessible online: https://www.broward.org/Auditor/Reports/Documents/2017_1212%20Agenda%20Review%20of%20Pharmac y%20 Benefit%20Management%20Services%20by%20StoneBridge/2017_1212%20Exh1_OptumRx.pdf; See also, Office of the Legislative Auditor General for the State of Utah, \"A Performance Audit of PEHP's Pharmacy Benefit Manager,\" 2019, accessible online: https://le.ut ah.gov/audit/19_13rpt.pdf; See also, MedPac, \"Status Report on Part D.

Even for patients with insurance, rebates ultimately increase costs to the patient for the benefit of PBMs and health insurers. At the point of sale, the inflated list prices caused by rebates \"hurt ... insured patients who pay coinsurance and deductibles based on drugs' list prices.\"46 Over the past several years, the number of patients on high -deductible health plans has skyrocketed.47 This has turned the insurance market upside down , causing the relatively small number of sick patients who pay high copays off of inflated list prices to subsize the cost of care for healthy people. In this form of \" reverse insurance ,\" the sickest patients ( e.g., those taking expensive cancer medic ations) generate a large share of manufacturer rebate payments , which in turn are used to \"subsidize the premiums for healthier [patients] .\"48 This is the opposite of how insurance is supposed to work . What's worse, PBMs' preference of highly -rebated drugs not only increas es patients ' out-of-pocket expense s, but also creates unnecessary burdens in receiving appropriate care, even to the point of fatality.49 PBMs have an incentive to favor high -priced drugs over drugs that are more cost -effective , because rebates are often calculated as a percentage of the manufacturer's list price . PBMs receive a larger rebate for expensive drugs than they do for ones that may provide better value at lower cost. This can also occur \"when a brand drug goes generic under the Hatch -Waxman Amend ments, with the first generic version being granted s ix months of market exclusivity,\" and \"[i]n exchange for substantial rebates, manufacturers [are given] an exclusive extension of their brand drug, which circumvents Hatch -Waxman and blocks generic competition. \"50 PBMs' financial motivations often result in more expensive and less efficacious drugs being placed on the drug formulary, which in turn hurts patient care.51 Again, PBMs are able to do this because of the sheer levels of market consolidation and integration, which is adversely impacting cancer care and fueling drug costs all in the interests of PBM profit s. 4.1.2 Harm to P lan Sponso rs While rebates are intended to lower the \"net price\" of drugs, thereby reducing costs to plan sponsors (including employers), there are several important ways th at PBM rebate s increase the costs of drugs for both plan sponsors and patients . The first way relates to the ability of plan sponsors, especially self -funded employers , to ensure the full amount of rebates are reported and passed through to them by PBMs . As noted above, it is extremely difficult to gauge the true amount of drug manufacturer rebates collected by PBMs, and this is only made more difficult by the advent of rebate aggregators.52 Unlike in the Medicare Part D program , PBMs typically do not legally owe self -funded employers any reporting on rebate s. PBMs employ exceedingly vague and 46 Neeraj Sood, et al., \"The Associa tion Between Community Oncology Alliance, \"Pharmacy Benefit manager Horror Stories - Part IV,\" \"PBM P&T Practices: The HEAT Initiative Is Gaining Momentum.\" P & T : a peer -reviewed journal for formulary management vol. 42,5 (2017): 330 -335. 51 See, Community Oncology Alliance, Letter to Defense Health Agency, \"The Perverse Financial Impact of Pharmacy Benefit Managers on Our Military Service Members Covered by the TRICARE Program ,\" 2019 52 See, supra Office of Broward County Auditor, \"Audit of Pharmacy Benefit Management Services Agreement,\" 2017. Page 87 of 367 February 2022 18 ambiguous contractual terms to rec ast monies received from manufacturers outside the traditional definition of rebates, which in most cases must be shared with plan sponsor s. Rebate administration fees, bona fide service fees, and specialty pharmacy discounts/fees are all forms of money r eceived by PBMs and rebate aggregators which may not be shared with (or even disclosed to) the plan sponsor.53 These charges serve to increase the overall costs of drugs, while providing no benefit whatsoever to plan sponsors. And while there might be gre ater reporting and disclosure obligations in the Medicare Part D and Medicaid programs ,54 the growth of rebate aggregators has created a way for PBMs (or their corporate affiliates) to retain rebates and not share them with plan sponsors. This causes the Part D plan sponsor to become liable to CMS to \"true up\" any reductions in cost caused by these rebates, despite the fact that the Part D p lan sponsor never actually received any rebates . Moreover, studies have shown that PBM rebates extracted from drug manufacturers drive up the drug spending of plan sponsors including Medicare and Medicaid.55 This is especially draining on already budget -strapped state governments. Since Medicare Par t D is financed through general revenues, beneficiary premiums, and state payments for dual -eligible beneficiaries (who received drug coverage under Medicaid prior to 2006), rebates also drive up the drug spending of the participating states and in turn, t axpayers' financial obligations to support Medicare Part D and Medicaid continues to rise.56 The total drug spend of a plan sponsor, regardless of whether it is a federal or state governmental program or a self -funded employer, will inevitably increase be cause PBMs are incentivized to favor expensive drugs that yield high rebate s.57 In some instances, PBMs purposely misclassify generic drugs as brand drugs to charge higher prices to plan sponsors, which ultimately generate higher rebate revenue.58 Moreov er, the gross -to-net bubble (i.e., the dollar difference between sales at brand -name drugs' list prices and their sales at net prices after rebates, discounts, and other reductions) has been growing at an exponential pace.59 The upward trend in the gross -to-net bubble reached $175 billion in 2019 .60 Based on this trend and the fact that plan sponsors are not receiving full value of the rebates from PBMs, it is evident that rebates increase total drug spend of plan sponsors and only benefit PBMs. The final and perhaps most long -term impact that rebates will have on plan sponsors is in the suppression of the biosimilar market. The greater use of less expensive biosimilars (essentially \"generic\" versions of biologic medication s) has the potential to reduce overall drug spending.

First, PBMs preference of highly rebated drugs limits providers' choice of optimal drug therapy for patients.64 Once again, this results in the PBM inserting itself in between the prescriber s and their patients and violates the sanctity of the doctor -patient relationship. This is especially true with biosimilar s. The greater use of biosimilars has the potential to reduce ove rall drug spending and provide greater clinical options for providers, including community oncology practice s. However, due to rebates, many PBMs do not include biosimilars in their preferred tier, thereby prevent wide -spread adoption and cost savings.65 In instances where biosimilars are included on formularies, this is done so inconsistently and on a patchwork basis, tied solely to the rebates that the PBM can extract from the drug manufacturer , and not the efficacy of the product. The r esult is that community oncology practice s often are required to stock several different versions of very expensive biosimilars based on the rules of the patient's PBM, rather than being able to prescribe and dispense the product that is best suited for th eir patients.66 Rebates further intrude on the doctor -patient relationship when combined with step therapy, prior authorization , or other utilization management protocols. \"Fail first\" s tep therapy r equires a patient to first fail once or twice on a medication specified by the PBM or health i nsure r before being allow ed to \"step up\" 61 See, James D.

The impact of step therapy, driven by rebating, is that it \" takes the medical decision -making out of the hands of doctors \" and put s it into the hands of the actuaries, accountants and businesspeople at the PBM, who are not choosing the drug that is most efficacious, or cheapest, or even most efficient - they are choosing the drug that is the most profitable.68 4.2 What Does the Law Say? Medicare Part D plan s ponsors are required to submit DIR reports to CMS disclosing the total amount of rebates, inclusive of manufacturer rebates and pharmacy rebates, retained by PBMs regardless of whether such rebates were passed to Medicare Part D plan sponsors.69 In the commercial market , many states have enacted laws that require transparency from PBMs and \"pass through\" pricing. For example, Delaware House Bill 194 enacted into law on July 17, 2019, permits the Insurance Commiss ioner to examine the affairs of PBMs, among other things.70 Likewise, under New York Senate Bill S1507A enacted into State Budget for the 2019 -2020 Fiscal Year on April 12, 2019, PBMs are required to fully disclose to the Department of Health and plan sponsor s the sources and amounts of all income, payments, and financial benefits.71 Similarly, Utah House Bill 272, which was enacted into law on March 30, 2020, requires PBMs to report all rebates and administrative fees to the Insurance Department includ ing the \"percentage of aggregate rebates\" that PBMs retained under its agreement to provide pharmacy benefits management services to plan sponsors.72 However, Maine Bill 1504, enacted into law on June 24, 2019, takes these reporting requirements a step further, and provides that \"[a]ll compensation remitted by or on behalf of a pharmaceutical manufacturer, developer or labeler, directly or indirectly, to a carrier, or to a pharmacy benefits manager under contract with a carrier, related to its prescription drug benefits must be: A. Remitted directly to the covered person at the point of sale to reduce the out -of-pocket cost to the covered person associated with a particular prescription drug; or B. Remitted to, and retained by, the carrier. Compensation remi tted to the carrier must be applied by the carrier in its plan design and in future plan years to offset the premium for covered persons.\"73 4.3 What Can Be Done? If high drug prices meaningfully addressed then outsized negative impact of rebates, rebate aggr egators , and the resulting high gross -to-net bubble must be addressed. Luckily there are several varied options available to the affected parties: 67 http://prescriptionprocess.com/barriers -to-access/step -therapy/ 68 42 U.S.C.

Requirements set forth under 42 CFR \u00a7 423.514(d) are not sufficient to cast the light of full transparency on PBMs (and rebate aggregators) that contract with Medicare Part D plan s ponsors.74 o Laws should be enacted that allow plan s ponsors to gain access to the drug m anufacturer rebates reported by PBMs and rebate aggregators.75 o Laws should be enacted that entitle Medicare Part D plan s ponsors and state Medicaid agencies to conduct full and complete audit s of PBMs and rebate aggregators and these entities should not have any ability to limit the scope and extent of such audit s.76 o Laws should be enacted that limit Medicare Part D plan sponsors' financial obligation to CMS in the event that PBMs and rebate aggregators retained drug manufacturer rebates that were not relayed to Medicare Part D plan s ponsors. It should be called out that some in Congress have the mistaken belief that drug manufacturers are the primary beneficiary of rebates in terms of \"buying\" formulary access for their drugs. Although this may be true in a limited number of cases, the realit y is that PBMs use rebates to extract - some would say \"extort\" - drug manufacturers to pay the rebate \"toll\" in order for PBMs to include these drugs on formulary or to avoid being part of a \"fail first\" step therapy scheme. Congress has been held hostag e to PBMs and their corporate affiliated health insurers by threatening to increase plan premiums if rebates are eliminated or made illegal. Plan Sponsor Action o As part of the PBM contracts, plan sponsors should: Require PBMs to seek approval from plan sponsors prior to delegating the rebate aggregation function to rebate aggregators. Require PBMs to disclose a list of rebate aggregators to plan sponsors. Require PBMs to disclose an unredacted contract with the rebate aggregator. Require PBMs to be pay fees to rebate aggregators for their services but such fees should not come from drug manufacturer r ebates. Require PBMs to agree to rebate audits conducted by plan sponsors and/or third - party auditor s at plan sponsors' choosing. 74 See, e.g., Social Security Act \u00a7 1860D -15, 42 U.S.C.

Page 91 of 367 February 2022 22 Require PBMs to report claims -level data on rebates collected on claims paid by pan sponsors. 5 Pharmacy Direct and Indirect Remuneration Fees As a result of a 2014 CMS rule change that went into effect in Plan Year 2016, PBMs have developed shrewd and c alculated methods of financial engineering, maximizing their revenue at the expense of the patient, the Medicare Part D Program , and providers. This was accomplished through pharmacy direct and indirect remuneration fees, or \"DIR fees.\" DIR fees are typi cally post point ranging from 1.5% to 11% of a drug's list price assessed by PBMs upon network pharmacy providers, typically three to six months after the provider has dispensed the medication. The concept of DIR fees arose out of Medicare P art D coverage for prescription drugs. Part D plan sponsors and Medicare Advantage plans offering drug coverage are paid by the government based on the actual cost for drug coverage. The actual cost is based on the Part D plan sponsor's \" negotiated price,\" which is then used as the basis to determine plan, beneficiary, manufacturer (in the coverage gap), and government costs during the course of the payment year, subject to final reconciliation following the end of the coverage year. Unfortunately, very few pharmacy price concessions have been included in the negotiated price at the point of sale. All pharmacy and other price concessions that are not included in the negotiated price must be reported to CMS as pharmacy DIR.77 As empl oyers and plan sponsors are demanding a greater share of the PBM rebates, and as those rebates have been threatened with regulation by state and federal lawmakers, PBMs have gone \"downstream\" to make up for any rebate revenue shortfalls by assessing DIR fees on pharmacy providers. In fact, DIR fees categorized as pharmacy price concessions have increased 45,000 percent between 2010 and 2017, and have hit a whopping $9.1 billion in 2019.78 77 Modernizing Part D and Medicare Advantage to Lower Drug Prices and Reduce Out -of-Pocket Expenses, 83 Fed. Reg. 62,175 (November 30, 2018). 78 Modernizing Part D and Medicare Advantage to Lower Drug Prices and Reduce Out -of-Pocket Expenses, 83 Fed. Reg. 62,174 of 367 February 2022 23 Figure 6. Explosion of Pharmacy DIR from 2013 to Present PBMs purport to pass a large portion of DIR fees to their plan sponsor clients, especially Part D plan sponsors - ironically, many of which are under the same corporation as the PBMs (e.g., CVS Caremark, one of the nation's largest PBM, and SilverScript, the nation's largest Medicare Part D plan sponsor, are both owned by CVS Health). However, no study has been conducted to match the deductions from pharmacy remittances for \"DIR\" with the DIR reported to CMS. Unfortunately , CMS cannot even perform such an audit today, as it does not require plans to submit DIR collected from each pharmacy, but rather requires DIR to be reported by drug, on an NDC number basis. Even if pharmacy DI R fees are reported accurately, Medicare risk corridors allow a Part D p lan sponsor that spends less than its bid estimate of costs to keep all savings up to 5% and a portion of those savings thereafter, which, in practice, allows PBMs and Part D plan sponsors to retain the vast majority of DIR fees collected.79 Thus, PBMs and Part D plan sponsors financially benefit from DIR fees. Worse yet, DIR fees on expensive specialty drugs are typically calculated as a percentage of a drug's list price. As such, DIR fees provide another incentive for PBMs to keep drug list prices high - high list price s yield not only larger rebates , but also larger DIR fees . As such, o ver the past several years DIR fe es have become a larger percentage of the overall revenue that PBMs and Part D plan sponsors receive . Simply put, PBMs are making their money one way or another \u2014 rebates or DIR fees from pharmacy providers. More problematic than the growth of DIR fees is the manner in which DIR fees are assessed on providers, especially community oncology practices . These fees are charged against community oncology practices based on their performance in a number of primary -care focused \"quality metric\" categories, which are totally unrelated and irrelevant to the cancer patients these practices treat . As a result, these community oncology practices have no meaningful ability to influence their performance scores - with no ability for upside - and such fees amount to nothing more than extort ion from practices. Given the market clout of the top PBMs in terms of the percentage of prescription drugs they manage, community oncolog y practices 79 Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Benefit, Congressional Research Services, Suzanne M. Kirchhoff, August 13, 2018, Available at: https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/ R40611.pdf. Page 93 of 367 February 2022 24 simply have to pay these DIR fees to stay in network , lest they lose the ability to provide dispensing services to their patients . These DIR fees are assessed after the point -of-sale. While they are sometimes recouped as soon as PBMs reimbur se providers (i.e., extracted from initial reimbursements) , in most cases DIR fees are assessed months after patients receive their medications. The total amount of DIR fees assessed on providers may not be known by providers until more than a year after a drug has been dispensed , as some PBM contracts create the potential for a partial or total refund of DIR fees (though a total refund is practically unobtainable). DIR fees increase patients' cost sharing responsibilities because patient out-of-pocket costs are based on an artificially inflated list drug prices at the point -of-sale; thus, in the case of Medicare patients, prematurely push ing them into the Medicare Part D \"donut hole .\" The cost of DIR fees also shifts the burden of drug costs to the federal government as more patients are prematurely pushed into the catastrophic phase of the Medicare benefit, resulting in higher financial contribution by the Medicare program . Ultimately, DIR fees weakens the overall benefit of the Medicare insurance benefit intended to provide health care coverage for our nation's oldest and most vulnerable citizens. Finally, DIR fees extracted from reimbursement to providers often res ults in drugs reimbursed below drug acquisition cost . Some speculate that this is yet another strategy by PBMs to ultimately drive pharmacy providers out of business so that the PBMs can take over the business with their retail, specialty, or mail - order p harmacies. PBMs are able to effectively \" extort \" DIR fees due to their size and hegemony. As of 2018, three companies - UnitedHealth, Humana and CVS Health - covered over half of all Medicare Part D patients.80 Pharmacy providers do not have a meaningful choice but to accept the terms being provided to them - rejecting just one Part D plan could mean losing out on being able to service nearly a quarter of their Medicare Part D patients. PBMs know the power the y hold and use it to its fullest extent. 5.1 Who Is Impacted? The expansion of DIR fees has had a substantial negative impact on both Medicare beneficiaries and the program as a whole. As confirmed in recent CMS studies, DIR fees ultimately shift financial li ability from the Part D plan sponsor to the patient, then ultimately to the f ederal government, through Medicare's catastrophic coverage phase . The shifting of financial liability away from the Part D plan s ponsor and to Medicare and the patient is even m ore pronounced with specialty medications, such as oral cancer medications . 5.1.1 Harm to Patients The primary harm to patients from DIR fees is that patients' out -of-pocket costs are higher because they are based on list drug prices . Once again, PBMs h ave a ve sted financial interest to have drug list prices as high as possible as DIR fees are assessed as a percentage of the list prices for expensive specialty drugs. Medicare Part D patients find themselves paying more for their medications because they pay in creased copayments and coinsurance on inflated point -of-sale list prices , which do not reflect the after -the-fact price adjustment in DIR fees that the PBM is clawing back from the pharmacy provider. The use of DIR fees by PBMs has degraded the quality of the Medicare Part D benefit available for beneficiaries, all the while providing an additional lucrative revenue source for PBMs and affiliated Part February 2022 25 plan sponsors.81 It has shifted the benefit of the Medic are Part D program from those who rely on it for drugs, to those that do not use it, in the form of lower (or zero dollar) premiums. Meanwhile, DIR has put upward pressure on drug expenditures for those that use the benefit. Studies conducted by CMS have concluded that DIR fees increase out -of-pocket costs for Medicare patients at the point of sale.82 Consider for example, that Medicare Part D beneficiaries' cost sharing is based on the PBM -determined rate at the point -of-sale. DIR fees are by definition not assessed at the point of sale. Thus, the patient's copayment or coinsurance that is based on the price at the point -of-sale is artificially inflated. CMS similarly concluded that DIR fees cost patients money, noting \"[w]hen pharmacy price concession s and other price concessions are not reflected in the negotiated price at the point of sale (that is, are applied instead as [Direct and Indirect Remuneration] at the end of the coverage year), beneficiary cost -sharing increases.\"83 Likewise, up until the end of the 2020 pla n year when the \"donut hole\" existed in the Medicare Part D Program , DIR fee programs push ed patients through the coverage stages much faster. Within the donut hole, patients pay 25% of the drug cost based on the (inflated) list price at the point -of-sale. The concern that patients continue to foot the bill for increase d costs is not hidden from scrutiny as a group of 21 U.S. Senators urged HHS to address DIR fees because \"beneficiaries face high -cost sharing for drugs and are accelerated into the coverage gap (or \"donut hole\") phase of their benefit.\"84 In addition, despite PBMs' purported justifications for such programs, DIR fees have not benefitted the quality of Part D plans offered to Medicare beneficiaries. For example, SilverScript had a 4.0 Star Rating from Medicare in 201885 (based on 2017 data), but saw its score drop to a 3.5 Star Rating in 201986 despite the widespread usage of DIR fees. At the same time, as the impact of DIR fees has increased dramatically since 2016, patients have also been impacted by diminished access to care as providers facing decreased net reimbursement are forced out of b usiness, forcing patients to receive services from pharmacies owned by or affiliated with the very PBMs and Part D plan sponsors extracting DIR fees ( see, Section 6, infra ).87 5.1.2 Harm to P lan Sponsor s Just as DIR fees negatively impact patients, PBM -Imposed DIR fees shift costs away from Part D plan sponsors, while increasing the costs to the Medicare program (and in turn, the taxpayer) for catastrophic coverage and subsidy payments.88 As mentioned, whe n a Medicare beneficiary is pushed through the benefits tiers and reaches the \"catastrophic coverage\" stage, the cost of services shifts to 80% paid by Medicare, while only 15% paid by the plan sponsors.89 The government covers these costs in part by turning 81 See, e.g. https://www.communityoncology.org/wp (Nov. 30, 2018) (\"The largest insurers, PBMs, and specialty pharmacies have now combined into vertically -integrated organizations.... these companies have also been rapidly integrating with healthcare providers.\") 88 See CMS, Medicare Part D - Direct and Indirect Remuneration (DIR) , of 367 February 2022 26 to the reinsurance marketplace. From 2007 through 2018, a period similar to when CMS saw DIR fees from pharmacy price concessions increase by more than 45,000 percent, reinsurance costs of Medicare so ared by 411%.90 Part D plan sponsors and their PBMs have a financial incentive to move Medicare beneficiaries into the catastrophic phase of coverage, to the detriment of the taxpayer. In fact, the National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA) commis sioned a report by Wakely Consulting Group, LLC to estimate the cost savings that would occur if congress prohibited retroactive reductions in payments by Part D plan sponsors in the form of DIR fees. Wakely Consulting Group, LLC found $3.4 billion in Par t D payments over a nine -year period if these fees were prohibited.91 Unfortunately, the harm from DIR fees goes beyond the Medicare program and American taxpayers. Like rebates, DIR fees have the effect of driving up the cost of drugs, through higher lis t prices. From 2013 to 2019, DIR fees rose from $229 million to an estimated $9.1 billion .92 Most striking, however, is that DIR fees now account for more than 18% of all Medicare rebates received by Part D plans.93 This increased reliance on DIR fee s relative to drug rebates, both of which are tied to the list price of drugs, highlights the upward pressure DIR fees have placed on list prices for drugs. During this same period, drug list prices grew between 10 -15% per year.94 Meanwhile, net prices have been relatively flat throughout this time period.95 These inflated list prices are felt by all plan sponsors - especially employers and state Medicaid programs - who do not receive any of the supposed benefits of DIR fees (such as lowered pre miums). PBMs have used their consolidation in the marketplace to use DIR fees and rebates in concert, fueling higher drug prices, while adversely impacting cancer care . 5.1.3 Harm to Providers To say that DIR fees have had an adverse impact on providers is a n understatement. DIR fees decrease pricing transparency creating uncertainty as to the true real reimbursement rates for drugs , very often driving reimbursement rates below the providers' acquisition cost of drugs ( see, Section 8, infra ). The metrics utilized by PBMs in implementing DIR fee programs are typically completely inapplicable to community oncology practices. Specifically, community oncology practices dispense primarily (and almost exclusively) specialty medications for cancer patients. As such, they have virtually no ability to influence their performance based on PBMs' \"quality metric\" categories measuring patient drug adherence relating to cholesterol, heart disease, and diabetes medications , which are relevant to dispensing general medications, not specialty drugs .96 Worse yet, adherence -based metrics are particularly problematic and in cases not only wholly inapplicable in treating cancer patients, but also may be very dangerous . Community oncologists are extremely vigilan t about monitoring their patients' cancer medication regimens and may temporarily discontinue or \"hold\" medications until a patient's status returns to an acceptable level , especially relating to adverse d rug side 90 http://medpac.gov/docs/default -source/default -document -library/part_d_public_jan_2020.pdf?sfvr sn=0 of H.R. 1038/S. 413 on CMS Payments Under Part D addition to harming patients, improper MAC pricing 92 is important to note that neither these metrics, nor the methodology in determining the performance scores are approved by CMS, and in fact, are n ot permitted by Medicare regulations. Page 96 of 367 February 2022 27 effects . The period during which the medi cation is \"held,\" or therapy is temporarily discontinued, is wrongly and obtusely measured by the PBM as a lack of adherence in one of the few areas where the community oncology practices may be measured , ultimately causing the community oncology practices ' performance to decrease, and the DIR fee assessment to subsequently increase. Consider, for example, Imbruvica (ibrutinib), which is dispensed by many community oncology practices to treat mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Studies have shown that Imbruvica tends to cause hematologic effects such as neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in MCL and CLL.97 If these adverse events occur at certain levels, the standard of care - as articulated directly by the FDA - approved package insert - is to hold the medication until the patient's lab values return to normal ranges.98 This can happen in as many as 46% of cases, resulting in discontinuing the patient's medication for up to a month. If community oncology practices are required to continue to dispense this drug, it will result in additional (and avoidable) costs to Medicare for the discontinued fills, as well as potential harm to the patient (along with potentially increased costs to Medicare for associated medical c osts). Further, due to the high cost of specialty drugs, and in particular, oncology medications, any small change in perceived adherence rates due to the purposeful physician -directed temporary discontinuation of therapy results in unreasonably low reimbu rsement rates99. Many PBMs justify their DIR fee programs as being designed to influence providers to deliver better care to patients in their Medicare Part D network s. On that clinical basis, if community oncology practices were to be \"influenced\" by th e PBMs' DIR fee metrics by adhering to a medication when the FDA -approved label calls for the therapy to be held, patients would suffer . As such , community oncology practices are often left without any meaningful way to impact PBMs' so-called \"quality m etrics\" and improve their DIR fee performance. Ultimately, community oncology practices have no way out. For them, due to the clout and market leverage of PBMs, DIR fees are simply a form of extortion that community oncology practices are forced to pay. 5.2 What Does the Law Say? The most directly applicable legal principles relating to pharmacy DIR fees are found in the federal Any Willing Provider law. Within the federal Any Willing Provider law, CMS expressly recognized that unreasonably low reimbu rsement, which often result after accounting for DIR fees, violate s the federal Any Willing Provider law.100 As it relates to the methodologies being used to assess DIR fees, performance criteria , and the manner in which PBMs and Part D plan sponsors are using those programs must also be reasonable and relevant.101 For community oncology practice s, performance criteria that they are unable to influence or performance criteria that does not reasonably measure optimal cancer care can run afoul of the federal Any Willing Provider law . 97 IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) [package insert].

Page 97 of 367 February 2022 28 In addition to explicit statutory language and CMS guidance, many of these principles are incorporated with in, and apply directly to, the contract between PBMs and community oncology practice s. PBM contracts include explicit obl igations that the PBMs will comply with federal code, statues, rules , and CMS guidance, including but not limited to the Medicare Part D Provider Manual. These contractual obligations are not included in the contract with pharmacies by choice, but rather federal law requires these terms to be included in the contract between CMS and plan sponsors, and in contracts with their first tier entities (including PBMs , and in contracts between PBMs and pharmacy providers ). This creates affirmative obligati ons on PBMs to comply with these laws , as well as the ability for p harmacy p roviders to directly challenge PBMs for breach es of contract when PBM actions do not comply with federal law. In January 2022, CMS introduced a proposed Final Rule that would alte r the way PBMs and Part D plan sponsors are required to report DIR fees.102 In particular, CMS has proposed that PBMs and Part D plan sponsors report the lowest possible reimbursement to pharmacy providers (inclusive of all potential DIR fees) as the \"nego tiated price.\"103 While this proposed rule (if finalized) could have the result of removing the financial incentive for PBMs and Part D plan sponsors to institute retrospective DIR fees, it does little to protect pharmacy providers against unreasonably low reimbursement rates or wholly irrelevant \"quality\" metrics when assessing DIR fees. 5.3 What Can Be Done? Legislative Solutions o Federal legislation should be enacted requiring that any DIR fee program ( i) be tied to relevant quality programs to the specialty being measured; (ii) actually measured on an individual pharmacy level; ( iii) provide equal opportunity for upside performance (i.e., not just a way for PBMs to \"rig\" the program to always measure downside performance resulting in DIR fees extracted from t he provider ); and ( iv) require that DIR fees be applied equally and fairly across all network pharmacies , specifically including PBM -owned or affiliated pharmacies). o Federal legislation should requir e that all pharmacy price concessions , including DIR fees , be included in the negotiated price at point -of-sale. o Federal legislation should give CMS greater latitude in regulating the reimbursement structure between Part D plan sponsors and pharmacy provid ers. Regulatory o CMS should i ssue regulation providing \"guard rails\" on what constitutes reasonable and relevant terms and conditions, and clarify that whether given terms are \"reasonable\" or \"relevant\" can be adjudicated in a private contractual dispute be tween Part D p lan sponsor s/PBMs and pharmacies . o CMS should initiate complaints against Part D plan sponsors and PBMs who have failed to pass on negotiated prices to patients at the point -of-sale, when DIR fees were 367 February 2022 29 knowable (i.e., the PBM maintain ed a minimum range of DIR fees that were to be assessed against every pharmacy no matter what). o CMS should initiate complaints against Part D plan sponsors and PBMs who have not paid providers based on reasonable and relevant terms and conditions, includin g through unreasonably low reimbursements, or irrelevant performance criteria. o CMS should require reporting of pharmacy DIR fees by both NDC number and pharmacy National Provider Identifier (NPI) allowing for full end -to-end audits of the flow of money from pharmacies to the Medicare program. The results of these audits should be made available to the public. 6 Restrictive Networks, Credentialing Abuses , and Artificial Barriers of Entry PBMs maintain a monopoly -like grasp on the industry , the natural result of which is the inability of patients to freely choose a provider based on his or her personal health care decisions , as opposed to the mandates of his or her PBM. As noted previously , only three PBMs process more than three -quarters of all prescription claims: CVS H ealth, Express Scripts, and OptumRx,104 while five PBMs process over 80% of all prescription claims. Each of the three major PBMs share common ownership with a major insurer and in turn with a mail -order and/or specialty pharmacy. These vertical, integrated relationships allow the PBMs to control the pharmaceutical supply chain, and erect superficial barriers to entry or even outright exclude entire classes of potential pharmacy providers. This is particularly pronounced in the context of cancer care, where t he introduction of new oncology therapies over the past several years , specifically, oral treatments for cancer and related conditions , presents new challenges for patients, p lan sponsor s, and providers alike. Between 2017 and 2019, there have been over twenty -four new oral cancer medications introduced into the marketplace.105 In 2020 alone, ten new oral oncolytics were approved by the FDA.106 As it stands, oral oncolytics make up 25% to 35% of cancer medications in development , making it likely tha t over the next several years, oral therapies will encompass an indispensable component of any treatment plan for cancer patients.107 While traditional chemotherapy infusion therapy that is \"administered\" is covered under a patient's \"medical\" benefits, or al oncolytics that are \"dispensed\" are being shifted to the patient's \"pharmacy\" benefits, managed by PBMs. Unlike chemotherapy administered in the clinic setting, the advent of oral oncolytics have given the PBMs a tremendous new opportunity to control c ancer care and divert prescriptions and profits to themselves. These new oral cancer medications can be extremely expensive, often ranging more than $10,000 per month.108 This is what is attracting PBMs, and a s a result, PBMs have attempted to use their ma rket size 104 See CVS, Express Scripts, and the Evolution of the PBM Business Model, available at https://www.drugchannels.net/2019/05/cvs -express -scripts-and-evolution -of.html).

Impact of pharmacy channel on adherence to oral oncolytics.BMC Health Page 99 of 367 February 2022 30 and leverage to limit dispensing of oral oncolytics through certain specialty and/or mail-order pharmacies, most often their own or affiliated pharmacy .109 PBMs use several different tactics to maintain their control over where patients receive their care. The first and foremost of these is creating restricted networks, blocking access to any provider that is not affiliated with their PBM. In these instances, the PBM will contend that the network is \"closed\" or that there is no \"network ,\" and thus, pharmacy providers are not even given the opportunity to apply for network admission. This occurs more frequently in the commercial insurance space involving employer -sponsored plans, but can also involve Medicaid managed care programs, where the PBM will require patients to receive their cancer medication from the PBM's wholly -own ed or affiliated pharmacy, and no one else. This is anticompetitive conduct - pure and simple - where patients are trapped into using one particular provider not ba sed on the quality of care provided by that provider but based on the financial arrangements and the corporate affiliation between the pharmacy provider and the PBM and/or health insurer. A related, but slight variation of this tactic is to restrict access to certain classes of providers (i.e., retail pharmacies), while excluding wholesale other classes of providers (i.e., dispensing physician practic es). For example, b eginning in early 2016, CVS Caremark espoused a self -serving stance that dispensing physician practices were now to be deemed \"out -of-network\" and no longer able to participate in Medicare Part D networks. This would have the effect of dramatically interrupting the ongoing relationship betwe en treating oncologists and their patients. CVS Caremark later backtracked on this position and began allowing \"grandfathered\" dispensing physicians (i.e., those that previously held a contract with the PBM) to continue in-network, but delayed the process ing of any new, non -grandfathered dispensing physician practices. In another instance, in January of 2018, Prime Therapeutics (Prime) - the PBM owned by a consortium of approximately twenty -two Blue Cross Blue Shield plans - announced that it would no long er accept any new dispensing physicians into its pharmacy networks on the alleged basis of \" fraud, waste, and abuse\" concerns and a commitment to maintaining to compliant networks. Without providing any further details, Prime claimed that Dispensing Physi cians did not adhere to Prime's Provider Manual. This trend expanded to existing in -network dispensing physicians actively servicing patients when, recently, Prime announced that it would also terminate existing, or \"grandfathered\" dispensing physicians f rom its networks. Despite having credentialed, contracted, and paid dispensing physicians as \"in -network\" Medicare Part D providers for over a decade, Prime seemingly unilaterally took the position that dispensing physicians are now considered \"out -of-network providers\" under Medicare Part D. Like wholesale network exclusion, these practices disadvantage vital providers while allowing PBM -owned or affiliated pharmacies to capture a greater share of prescription volume . Even in instances where a PBM nominally allows a community oncology practice to apply for network participation, the PBM can still place other barriers in the way of providers being able to service their patients by imposing onerous credentiali ng process es. For a community oncology practice to service patients within a PBM's network, PBMs require that the provider adhere to specific and extremely onerous, credentialing requirements, including the requirement that the provider maintain certain accreditations. These conditions are made e ven more onerous where PBMs delay the review of credentialing applications (seemingly with the intention to avoid admitting these providers), enact credentialing applications with terms and conditions designed to keep out providers (rather than ensuring th e quality of providers) or allow participation but at rates so low that reimbursement may not even cover the acquisition cost of a drug. 109 See Nancy J. Egerton, In -Office Dispensing of Oral Oncolytics: A Continuity of Care and Cost Mitigation Model for Cancer Patients, Am. J. Manag. Care Vol. 22, Supp. No. 4, S100 (2016), https://www .ncoda.org/wpcontent/uploads/bpattachments/7218/ajmcpan032016inofficedispensingcontinuityofcar ebynancyegerton.pdf) Page 100 of 367 February 2022 31 These obstructionist policies harm patients, degrade the quality of prescribers and benefit only PBMs that are incentiv ized to continue to these illegitimate practices . Finally, even when a community oncology practice has ultimately been admitted into a PBM's network, PBMs continue to utilize other tactics to drive patients away from community oncology practices, and towar ds PBM -owned or affiliated pharmacies. This includes tactics such as patient slamming and claim hijacking (see, Section 7, infra ), misleading communications aimed at steering patients to PBM -owned or affiliated pharmacies, and creating patient incentives for patients (such as lower copays, larger days ' supply or free products/services) to utilize preferred PBM -owned or affiliated pharmacies. PBMs also utilize other tactics, such as abusive auditing practices (i .e., requiring the production of thousands of pages of documentation to support claims billed) and terminating providers without cause or on pretextual bases (i.e., that they only dispense one class of medications). PBMs employ these tactics to maintain th eir oppressive market dominance. But at the same time, in a vicious cycle, these tactics are themselves the consequence of the h orizontal and vertical consolidation within and between insurance and PBM markets , which has created merged entities with such oppressive power that it a virtual chokehold on community oncology practices and pharmacy providers . The result of these tactics is that patients are steered away from receiving care at their community oncology practices, and forced to receive care from P BM-owned or affiliated pharmacies. This is not only without regard to the impact on patient care and outcomes, but as the chart below demonstrates, only continues to prop up higher drug prices and charges . Page 101 of 367 February 2022 32 6.1 Who Is Impacted? The overall lack of industry standards and oversight in the PBM credentialing sphere has led to arbitrary denials and lengthy, costly application processes, that ultimately have a negative impact on a community oncology practice's ability to focus on patient care. Instead of allowing community oncology practices to enter into their networks, PBMs attempt to limit the dispensing of oral oncolytics through their own specialty pharmacies, leading to poor patient compliance an d adherence to life -saving treatments, causing the quality of cancer care to suffer.110 110 See American Pharmacists Association, Pharmacy credentialing --challenges (August Page 102 of 367 February 2022 33 These tactics have had negative impact all across the spectrum, affecting patients, health care payers (including Medicare, Medicaid, employers and taxpayers), and prov iders. 6.1.1 Harm to Patients These exclusionary practices - whether they be unreasonable barriers to entry or outright exclusion of certain classes of providers - result in serious harm to patients, specifically those who are seeking the services of community oncology practices that have been excluded from a PBM specialty network. For one, these exclusionary practices destroy existing patient -provider relationships. In early 2016, when CVS Caremark undertook re -interpreting longstanding CMS regulations, it did so in such a way as to effectively cut out physicians from continuing to dispense medications to their existing Medicare Part D patients.111 PBMs have no regard for the continuity of these vital health care relationships and their impact on patients' well-being and outcomes. This is critical, as patients are more likely to raise certain questions or concerns about their medications, when these medications are dispensed by community oncology practices . To strip patients, who are facing serious life -threatening diseases, of that important patient -provider relationship could result in serious patient harm.112 This also has the effect of decreasing medication adherence, which would further affect patients , especially those undergoing life -saving treatments at community oncology practices .113 The ultimate outcome of creating restricted networks or excluding entire classes of providers, namely, that patients are essentially required to obtain medications at a PBM -owned or affiliated pharmacy. It is well - documented114 that when the PBM -owned or affiliated pharmacy is responsible for filling the patients' prescriptions, it results in worse care . The near -monopolistic control of the network, combined with the lack of patient choice, remove any checks and balances on the quality of the care being provided. Consider, f or example, a patient battling cancer was denied life -saving medications by a PBM due to the PBM being unwilling to enter medications into its computer system.115 In another example, a patient had been diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome -positiv e + chronic myeloid leukemia and had been responding positively to \"180mg\" of a certain medication. However, according to the patient's PBM, the medication had to come from the PBM's mandated mail order specialty pharmacy instead of a pharmacy of their cho ice. Since the medication was not available in a single 180mg dosage form, the prescription clearly indicated that the patient was to receive a \"100 mg tablet and a n 80 mg tablet.\" Instead, over the course of the next several months, the PBM pharmacy disp ensed either a 100 mg tablet or an 80 mg tablet, 111 See CVS Health Corp., Letter to Congressman Ed Whitfield from Senior Vice President of Government and Public Affair Melissa A. Schulman (Feb. 19, 2016 ) [\"CVS -Whitfield Letter\"]. 112 See First Coast Health Solutions, How In -Office Dispensing Can Improve Patient's Clinical Outcomes (June 30, See Jacob G. Moroshek, Improving outpatient primary medication adherence with physician guided, automated dispensing (2017), https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5221544/; see also Marie T. Brown, MD and Jennifer K. Bussell, MD, Medi cation Adherence: WHO Cares? (April 2014), https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3068890/. 114 See Georgia General Assembly, 2019 -2020 Regular of 367 February 2022 34 but never both. Ultimately, the patient did not respond well to the lowered dosages of the medication.116 Finally, in a particularly disturbing example, a colorectal cancer patient was prescribed a common ora l medication that had been on the market for nearly twenty years. The patient's PBM mandated that the patient fill the prescription at a large, well -known specialty pharmacy, and the patient's oncologist prescribed the medication to be taken in rounds wit h the following specific instructions: 'two weeks on, one week off.' The PBM mail -order pharmacy neglected to include the 'one week off' instruction on the label, and as a result, the patient ended up in the intensive care unit of a hospital.117 Unfortun ately, patients often do not have any ability or choice to switch their PBMs in order to have control over which pharmacy provider from whom they would like to receive service. PBMs who undertake these restrict ive practices are typically selected by the patient's employer (or sometimes by the insurance company selected by the patient's employer). The patients are two, some times three steps removed from any part of the decision -making process. Since most patient get their health care coverage through their jobs, the only way a patient can exert any control over the network of pharmacy providers is to change jobs and hope th at their new employer utilizes a different PBM's network. But, in a world where three PBMs account for nearly 8 0% of the marketplace, the odds of getting a better PBM are slim to none. The PBMs know th e level of power that they wield. And their focus is on profits, not patients. Ultimately, given the acute focus on patient care inherent in community oncology practices, patients suffer when those providers are forced out of the space.118 6.1.2 Harm to Plan Sponsors In addition to patients, these exclusionary practices harm plan sponsors , such as Medicare and Medicaid, because they cause an artificial rise in the cost of specialty medication, particularly within the oncology space. Specifically, the exclusion of community oncology practices from PBM networks require more patients to utilize PBM -owned or affiliated mail -order and/or specialty pharmacies. This, in turn, leads to exponentially more waste of medication, causing increased costs to plan sponsor s.119 Mail -order pharmacies, without proper acc ess to patient outcomes, routinely dispense 90 -day supplies of medications. In several instances, patients continue to receive medications despite their repeated requests to have the mail -order pharmacy cease sending medication, often due to a change in th eir course of treatment. In more tragic cases , the PBM mail -order pharmac ies continue to dispense medications to the patient's residence despite the patient having passed away , leading to the waste of unwanted, expensive medications.120 116 See Community Oncology Alliance, Pharmacy Benefit Manager Horror Stories - Part IV (August 1, 2018), https://communityoncology The Advantage of Independent Pharmacies , Pharmacy Times, March 12, , at S100.

Among those specialty models is the Oncology Care Model, which aims to provide higher quality, more highly coo rdinated oncology care at the same or lower cost to Medicare. The Oncology Care Model \"provides an incentive to participating physician practices to comprehensively and appropriately address the complex care needs of the beneficiary population receiving chemotherapy treatment and heighten the focus on furnishing services that specifically improve the patient experience or health outcomes.\"122 PBM exclusionary practices would thwart this initiative. Likewise, in the private sector, value -based care (VBC) inn ovations are on the rise, increasing the quality while lowing the overall cost to health care payer and their patients. The ability to tie benefits to providers and value to patients is critical to aligning interests in the health care space and has long been a long -term goal of health policy experts. However, this type of integration of medical and pharmacy care is against the interest of current PBM practices to implement . Absent changes to PBM regulation, the federal government will be unable to achie ve some of the same cost -saving/quality improving measures as is being utilized in primarily the self -funded employer sponsor health care space. Unfortunately , these lost opportunities are not made up for in savings garnered by PBMs, and in fact, quite the opposite has occurred. As illustrated in the figure on page 36, the exclusion of community oncology practices and other independent providers allows PBMs to pocket more through their wholly -own ed or affiliated mail-order and specialty pharmacies. In a study conducted by Ohio's Medicaid Managed Care Pharmacy Services, PBMs billed taxpayers 8.8% more for medications than what they paid pharmacies. This difference, commonly referred to as \"spread\" has been growing and is typically the highest on specialty medications, such as oral oncolytics.123 Worse yet, similar data has shown that the spread between plan sponsor funded PBM revenue and pharmacy - captured reimbursement has increased over time. In short, PBMs are keeping more and more revenue from health care costs to the detriment of others in the health care space . 121 See NCPA: Mail Order Waste All Too Common; Documented by Federal Officials, March 5, 2013, https://www.pharmacytimes.com/ajax/NCPA -Mail -Order-Waste -All-Too-Common -Documented -by-Federal -Officials.

Page 105 of 367 February 2022 36 Ultimately, when compared to costs of PBM exclusionary practices, t he savings associate d with dispensing by community oncology practice s are palpable. Reports estimate that physician point -of-care dispensing could save seniors and taxpayers over $20 billion in Medicare Part D alone.124 6.1.3 Harm to Providers An increasingly important component of the physician -patient relationship with oncology is the dispensing of medications to patients through the community oncology practice, at the site of care . Excluding community oncology practices from PBM networks prevents physicians from providing consistent care to their patients.125 When PBMs impose unreasonably high or arbitrary requirements for network admission, designed for no purpose other than to serve as an artificial barrier of entry, they place immense and undue burdens on 124 See Physician Point -of-Care Dispensing Could Save Seniors and Taxpayers $20 Bi llion on Generic Drug Costs in Medicare Evaluation of Prescriber Drug Dispensing (20 14), https://dopl.utah.gov/PrescriberDrugDispensing.pdf. Page 106 of 367 February 2022 37 community oncology practices seeking to service their patients. As noted above, these credentialing standards often require a provider to hold multiple forms of accreditation, such as URAC and ACHC. These specified accreditations are often not the most relevant or appropriate form of accreditation for community oncology practices, and do not constitute the most applicable form of endorsement based on the unique and specialized services provided by community o ncology practices. Between the standards set forth under the Oncology Care Model (OCM) and Quality Oncology Practice Initiative (QOPI\u00ae) Certification Program, community oncology practices also attain high standards of practices, validated by third parties , that obviate the need for separate accreditation. For example, QOPI has a certification program specifically designed for clinical oncology practices as this process \"can routinely evaluate practice performance against quality measures and standards esta blished by experts in the oncology field.\" Likewise, through the CMS -created OCM , community oncology practices have entered into payment arrangements that include financial and performance accountability for episodes of care surrounding chemotherapy admini stration to cancer patients. The practices participating in OCM have committed to providing enhanced services to Medicare beneficiaries such as care coordination, navigation, and national treatment guidelines for care. The fact that CMS has involved itself in the creation of this type of model with standards that directly correlate to community oncology providers demonstrates that these two programs (OCM and QOPI) would be the best industry standards to judge a network provider. Moreover , requiring dual ac creditation - including URAC accreditation in Specialty Pharmacy - apart from being redundant, also increases the risks that the provider will have multiple, sometimes contradictory compliance requirements, needing to comply with not just ACHC standards, b ut also URAC standards, which at times can be diverging. Finally, these accreditations can be prohibitively expensive and costly, making it impracticable for providers to undertake the steps necessary to even seek admission to the networks. Likewise, when PBMs take steps to delay credentialing, this too harms p harmacy p roviders. Community oncology practices have to divert considerable amount of time and resources to respond to repeated follow ups on their credentialing applications under normal circumstan ces. However, when a PBM \"slow rolls\" an application and takes months to review and respond to inquiries, this has often led to the PBM asking the provider to provide the same documentation over, and over and over again (i.e., licenses that expire and are renewed over the course of the sometimes 18 -month long credentialing process). This takes time away from being able to service patients. But perhaps the most direct way providers are harmed by these tactics is through the actual effects of network exclus ion. D ue to the size and market share of each PBM (see, Section 3, supra ), a PBM termination or exclusion often spells irreparable harm for a provider seeking to participate in pharmacy networks and/or the Medicare Part D program.126 Particularly alarming is the fact that about two -thirds of all Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan enrollees are concentrated in networks across just three pay ers: OptumRx, CVS Caremark, and Humana. Exclusion from any one of these payers could make dis pensing simply not a viable option for a community oncology practice .127 126 See Pharmacy Benefit Managers' Attack on Physician Dispensing and Impact on Patient Care: Case Study of CVS Caremark's Efforts to Restrict Access to Cancer Care (August 2016), https://communityonco logy.org/wp - content/uploads/2018/08/PBMs_Physician_Dispensing -WhitePaper_COA_FL.pdf. 127 See Adam J. Fein, Medicare Part D 2016: 75% of Seniors in a Preferred Pharmacy Network (PLUS: Which Plans Won and Lost), Drug Channels (Jan. 20, 2016), http://www.drugch annels.net/2016/01/medicare -part-d-2016 -75-of- seniors -in.html Page 107 of 367 February 2022 38 6.2 What Does the Law Say? Among all the barriers that PBMs put in front of providers - including onerous credentialing process es, restricting network access, steering to owned or affilia ted pharmacies - the core legal principles largely tie back to rules promulgated around freedom of patient choice and network participation. Remarkably, there are several federal and state laws on the books that seek to safeguard the rights of patients to select the provider of their choice, or to protect community oncology practices from undue network termination or exclusion. In the federal statutes establishing and governing the Medicare program, Congress has included explicit \"Any Willing Provider\" requirements, which relate directly to network access for Medicare providers, including community oncology practices. These statutes appl y to all Part D plan sponsors, as Part D plan s ponsors are under the purview of CMS, pursuant to contracts between the Part D plan sponsors and CMS. The Medicare Any Willing Provider law (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w -104) explicitly requires that all Part D prescrip tion drug plans permit \"the participation of any pharmacy that meets the terms and conditions under the plan.\" The federal \"Any Willing Provider\" law further prohibits health insurers from creating exclusive provider networks - or unduly barring entry to such networks (such as through artificial barriers of entry) - to which insured patients are directed to the exclusion and detriment of non -network providers.128 In fact, as it relates to credentialing abuses, CMS has also questioned whether mandatory accreditations should be considered \"standard terms and conditions\" of a network, and whether PBMs should instead explore other reasonable and relevant alternatives to ensure quality assurance and actual improved patient care, particularly where certain accred itation requires may be arbitrary and not directly proven to ensure quality assurance.129 Likewise, federal law provides protection directly for patients to have the freedom to select a provider of their choice.130 Pursuant to 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 431.51(a), Medicaid beneficiaries may obtain services from any qualified Medicaid provider that undertakes to provide services to them. However, plan sponsors commonly use preferred networks to incentivize beneficiaries to fill cl aims at pharmacies of the Plan's choice (rather than the beneficiary's choice), by offering reduced co -pays at preferred pharmacies. Several states also maintain their own versions of \"Any Willing Provider\" protections. For example, North Carolina's Any W illing Provider Law provides that a health benefit plan shall not \"[p]rohibit or limit a resident of th[e] State ... from selecting a pharmacy of his or her choice when the pharmacy has agreed to participate in the health benefit plan according to the terms offered by the insurer,\" or \"[d]eny a pharmacy the opportunity to participate as a contract provider under a health benefit plan if the pharmacy agrees to provide pharmacy services that meet the terms and requirements, including terms of reimbursement, of the insurer under a health benefit plan...\"131 Similarly, Tennessee's Any Willing Provider Law provides similar limitations on the ability to exclude providers such as community oncology practice s, mandating that \"[n]o health insurance insurer and no managed health insurance insurer may... deny any licensed pharmacy or licensed pharmacist the part to participate as a participating provider in any policy, contract, or plan on the same terms and conditions are 128 See, e.g., Kentucky Ass'n of Health Plans v. Miller, 538 U.S. 329 (2003) 129 See, e.g., Caremark's Specialty Credentialing Application; see, e.g., OptumRx's Specialty Designated Network Applicat ion.

Ann. \u00a7 58 -51-37(c) Page 108 of 367 February 2022 39 offered to any other provider of pharmacy services und er the policy, contract or plan\" or \"[p]revent any person who is a party to or a beneficiary of any policy, contract, or plan from selecting a licensed pharmacy of the person's choice ... provided that the pharmacy is a participating provider under the same terms and conditions of the contract, policy or plan as those offered any other provider of pharmacy services.\"132 These laws prohibit not just outright network exclusion, but also a host of other PBM practices aimed at requiring that patient use their whol ly-owned or affiliated pharmacies. At both the federal and state levels, policy recognizes the importance of provider access and, ultimately, competition via the enactment of these \"Any Willing Provider\" rules. Unfortunately, these laws have not been wi thout attack by the powerful PBMs,133 and in few instances do they provide pharmacies a private right of action to enforce and ensure they are meaningfully applied . 6.3 What Can Be Done? Legislative o Congress should e nact federal legislation that provides a private right of action for community oncology practice s to exercise their rights under the federal Any Willing Provider law, particularly when they are unfairly excluded from PBM networks and a private right of action will all ow the enforcement of a regulation by a private party, such as a community oncology practice , allowing for litigation or the threat of litigation to incentivize compliance of the law . o Congress should e nact state legislation that curbs credentialing abuses and provides for stronger Any Willing Provider laws and provides for a private right of action for community oncology practice s to exercise. Regulatory o CMS should pursue complaints against PBMs for their con struct of artificial barriers of entry and failure to adhere to the establishment of reasonable and relevant terms and conditions of participation. o CMS should also enact regulation to specify \"reasonable\" and \"relevant\" standards of participation to allow for defined requirements PBMs must adhere to. o CMS should i ssue regulation providing \"guard rails\" on what constitutes reasonable and relevant terms and conditions, and clarify that whether given terms are \"reasonable\" or \"relevant\" can be adjudicated in a private contractual dispute between Part D p lan sponsor s/PBMs and pharmacies . o State Departments of Insurance should pursue complaints against PBMs for violations of Any Willing Provider Laws, and Medicaid Free -Choice -of-Provider provisions .

Cancer patients require ease of treatment and as little confusion as possible, in order to have a positive outcome. Based on these principles, Section 30.2.2.3 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual prohib its PBMs and Part D plan sponsors from \"Steering of physicians or beneficiaries to a sponsor's and/or PBM's own mail order Pharmacy.\" Such prohibition specifically includes steering of prescribers' patients to a specialty pharmacy owned by or affiliated w ith a plan sponsor/PBM and most PBM contracts require adherence to CMS Guidance and contain compliance with law provisions. Despite the law, there are innumerable instances where the PBM s haves effectively utilized claims or fill data and sought to move the prescription away from the provider of the patient's choice and toward the PBM's wholly -owned or affiliated pharmacy . This practice, sometimes referred to as \"prescription trolling,\" \"patient slamming,\" or \"claim hijacking,\" plays out fairly consisten tly. A typical case might involve a situation where the PBM allows the provider to submit a claim (typically a high -cost specialty medication), then reject it claiming that it required a prior authorization (PA). Then, once the provider has done all the required work to obtain the approval for the PA, it is subsequently rejected once again by the PBM, this time for the apparent reason that it \"must\" be filled at the PBM -owned or affiliated specialty pharmacy. Pharmacy p roviders typically transmit prescription claims (and sometimes PA requests) to the patients' PBM for purposes of having it adjudicated and receiving reimbursement. Such transmissions clearly contain protected health information (PHI) and are directed sole ly at the PBM acting as the claims adjudicator. Instead of simply reviewing and processing this claim, in its fiduciary capacity as the PBM, the PBM improperly and unlawfully accesses the PHI, and illegally communicates the claim information to its relate d entity (a PBM -owned specialty pharmacy). While the PBM is processing the PA, the PBM -owned or affiliated pharmacy surreptitiously communicates to the patient, prescriber, or both, with the goal of having the prescription filled at the PBM -owned or affili ated specialty pharmacy . Community oncology practice s have documented134 some egregious instances where the PBM blatantly lied to the patient and pharmacy staff, saying the prescribing physician had authorized the transfer, when in fact, they clearly had n ot. Further, with complete disregard to not only patient privacy laws, but also state Pharmacy Practice Acts, PBM - 134 https://communityoncology.org/the -real-life-patient -impact -of-pbms -volume -i/ Page 110 of 367 February 2022 41 owned specialty pharmacies have brazenly filled and dispensed the medication in complete absence of having an actual, signed prescription in hand.135 Worrisomely, more deceitful and underhanded variations of this also exist. In some instances, PBM -owned or affiliated pharmacies have sought to mislead patients into thinking that their physician wants the prescription to be filled at the PBM -owned or affiliated pharmacy, or otherwise imbed prescription transfer documentation in the information the PBM provides to the phy sician in order to renew the prescription for refill (and the physician unknowingly signs to have the prescription transferred). 7.1 Who Is Impacted? 7.1.1 Harm to Patients A direct result of prescription trolling is severe confusion and distress for cancer patient s, who are caught in the middle, uncertain of when or from where they will receive their next dose of their life saving medication .136 These concerns in the context of prescription trolling go beyond those when a PBM takes steps to create a restricted netw ork ( see, Section 6, supra); it is far more insidious here. While p atients cannot be compelled to fill their prescription from a specific dispenser, many report receiving correspondence from their PBM impl ying that they must use a pharmacy owned by or aff iliated with the PBM. These letters often explain that the insurance company has its own \"preferred\" pharmacy, from which the patient may already be receiving other prescribed drugs and offer for the patient to also get their oral cancer drug from this same source. PBMs may try to entice patients to select their \"preferred\" pharmacy through lower patient copayments to the patient only for the patient to later realize their oral oncolytic s cost more at the \"preferred\" pharmacy than a non -preferred provider. Many patients find this confusing and do not understand the repercussions that jeopardize the monitoring, care control, and clinical management that they receive at their community onc ology pharmacy, and they mistakenly, or unintentionally, switch their drug dispenser.137 Many patients may require special assistance from their community oncology practice that has documented and understands their medical history, monitors for drug intera ctions between their medications, and is able to make appropriate dosing adjustments at the time of administration. Furthermore, a patient who is switched over to a PBM -owned or affiliated mail-order pharmacy often has his/her medication shipped from a dis tance (sometimes several state s away), running the risk that the drug could be rendered ineffective in treating that patient's condition due to a lack of sufficient temperature control during transit.138 In short, the h arm can literally be deadly for patie nts with cancer, because of the disease and drugs involved - medications arriving too late or failure to timely amend dosing regimens can be the difference for life and death for these patients. Perhaps worst of all, PBMs and their wholly -owned or affiliated specialty pharmacies have been known to employ underhanded tactics to \"hijack\" the prescription. In one particularly egregious instance , a PBM - 135 See Hot Topics in Specialty Pharmacy Law: PBM Prescription Trolling, HUB Arr angements, DIR Fees Update, Opioid and Naloxone Laws, and NADAC Pricing, May 26, 2020, available at https://www.frierlevitt.com/wp - content/uploads/2017/06/Hot -Topics -in-SPRX -Law-Final_PDF.pdf. 136 See Pharmacist says CVS Strong -Arms Cancer -Drug Business, May -cancer -drug -business/1 137 See PBMs: Their Role, the Problems, and How Practices Can Work With Them, May 2 7, 2020, available at https://www.ajmc.com/journals/evidence Healthcare Bullying: Some Call it Steering, We Call it Scare Tactics, May 26, 2020, availa ble at https://www.truthrx.org/theputtblog/healthcare -bullying -some -call-it-steering -we-call-it-scare -tactics Page 111 of 367 February 2022 42 affiliated specialty pharmacy contacted a community oncology practice claiming that o ne of the clinic's patients had requested that his lung cancer medication be transferred to the PBM -affiliated pharmacy and deman ded the clinic's immediate compliance in the matter. Surprised by the news, the oncologist contacted the patient to inquire abo ut his decision, only to discover that this was the first time the patient had heard of the matter. \"Please do not transfer it anywhere else!\" the patient requested . \"I want to get it filled through the dispensary. I did not ask for this. I love being able to get this right away and with no hassles. I was on an oral chemo before and it was filled by a specialty pharmacy and I always was getting it late, missed a few days of medication sometimes and had numerous phone calls from them. They never seemed to kn ow what was going on with my medication.\"139 As evidenced by this true story account, patients receiving their oral drugs from a community oncology practice have access to those drugs within 24 hours of prescribing, and they can begin treatment immediately . Patients receiving their oral cancer drugs through a PBM, on the other hand, often have a much longer wait, sometimes 14 days or more. In addition to the delays, it is clear the oncology practices have access to patient records and can more closely monit or patients which empowers them to provide the most coordinated care .140 In the end , the PBMs' lack of transparency to the patient and the general public usurps the patient's right of choice and circumvents the prescriber's orders and independent profession al judgment . 7.1.2 Harm to P lan Sponso rs The greatest harm to plan sponsors stemming from prescription trolling and claims hijacking is increased potential for waste, particularly compared to when the claim would otherwise be filled by the community oncology practice. Many times, a community oncology practice can identify certain medications that may be difficult to tolerate or patients whose conditions may require multiple dosing refinements. In these cases, in anticipation of such modifications, practices will often dispense a 15 -day supply rather than a 30 - or 90 -day supply. PB M specialty mail order pharmacies can lack the expertise for such forethought or do not have the experience with care management to know when a smaller supply might be the wiser, more economical choice.141 Ultimately, mandatory diversion of patients to PBM mail order pharmacie s leads to increased waste of often -expensive and unwanted medication, thereby increasing overall health care spending, at the expense of Medicare and taxpayers.142 In a study funded by the Community Pharmacy Foundation reviewing medi cations being returned for disposal and destruction, i t was found that prescriptions originating through mail order were far more likely to have excess ive amounts of unused medication remaining (i.e., 80% o r more of the prescribed quantity) when compared t o retail pharmacies.143 In the cancer space, these issues of waste can be extremely costly. ln a particularly well -documented instance, a battling advanced colorectal cancer was told that his health plan would only cover his prescription for oral oncolytics if he 139 See The Real -Life Patient Impact of PBMs: Volume I, May 27, 2020, available at https://communityoncology.org/the -real-life-patient -impact -of-pbm s-volume -i/ 140 See PBMs: Their Role, the Problems, and How Practices Can Work With Them, May 27, 2020, available at https://www.ajmc.com/journals/evidence PBMs: Their Role, the Problems, and How Practices Can Work With Them, May 27, 2020, available at https://www.ajmc.com/journals/evidence Com munity Pharmacists Association, Waste Not, Want Not: Examples of Mail Order Pharmacy Waste, May 27, 2020, available at http://www.ncpa.co/pdf/waste -not-want 43 obtained them through the PBM's mail -order pharmacy.144 After he waited nearly two weeks to receive his prescription, w hen it finally came, it included incorrect dosing instructions , and he was told by the PBM - owned pharmacy to send back the medication (worth $20,000) so it could be destroyed.145 Even when the medication was ordered again, it came with fewer pills than were prescribed.146 While the PBM -owned or affiliated pharmacies continue to make errors a nd cause patients to endure life -threatening delays, the plan sponsors - like employers and Medicaid programs - are left footing the bill for these wasted products to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars in this one instance alone. 7.1.3 Harm to Providers In addition to circumvent ing the prescriber's orders and independent professional judgment , the PBM s' tactics of prescription trolling further serves to push the burden of performing the initial administrative functions on to the community oncology practice s, while removing any attendant benefits , as the first fill is the most expensive claim. The first fills of a prescription are typically a pharmacy's most expensive claims due to several factors , including coordination with prescriber, prior authoriz ation efforts , researching and liaising with patient assistance programs, engaging in patient training and providing skilled nursing administration .147 And further, at its core, through these claim rejections, the PBMs are once again depriving provider s of any ongoing and expected future business relationships with patients who initially sought to fill prescrip tions with their provider.148 Apart from just the lost revenue, at their core, these tactics c reate a lot more work for already burdened community oncology practices and make patient treatment much more difficult. In the course of the PBMs' efforts jockeying for control of the prescription, staff at community oncology practices spends hours on the phone with all the di sconnected and disjointed stakeholders, just trying to get the prescription filled and in the patient's hands. This includes speaking with the PBM, then the insurance company, then the PBM - owned or affiliated pharmacy, then the PBM again - and this all as sumes everything goes \"smoothly.\" It is well-documented that these additional layers of unnecessary administrative complexity burden the health care system, with health care stakeholders spend ing about $496 billion on billing and insurance -related costs each year.149 These additional administrative burdens have been found to have a direct negative impact on patient care.150 Yet PBMs remained focused on maximizing profits. As the chart below show, immense profit comes along with diverting prescriptions to PBM -owned pharmacies. Within the Florida Medicaid program, the overwhelming majority of \"profits\" earned from dispensing brand name drugs (including cancer medications) was retained by just three PBM -owned or affiliated Specialty Pharmacy Law: PBM Prescription Trolling, HUB Arrangements, DIR Fees Update, Opioid and Naloxone Laws, and NADAC Pricing, May 26, 2020, available at https://www.frierlevitt.com/wp - content/uploads/2017/06/Hot -Topics -in-SPRX -Law-Final_PDF.pdf 148 See Hot Topics in Specialty Pharmacy Law: PBM Prescription Trolling, HUB Arrangements, DIR Fees Update, Opioid and Naloxone Laws, and NADAC Pri cing, May https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/m16 -2697 Page 113 of 367 February 2022 44 The combination of restricted networks, prescription trolling, and the mandating of dispensation of specialty drugs at specific pharmacies has been a boon to the specialty pharmacy arms of the nation's largest insurers and PBMs, driving disproportionate pr ofit to them vis-\u00e0-vis their unaffiliated pharmacy peers. Page 114 of 367 February 2022 45 7.2 What Does the Law Say? In addition to federal and state Any Willing Provider and Freedom of Patient Choice laws, which are certainly implicated by PBMs directing patients to their wholly -owned or a ffiliated pharmacies and excluding community oncology practice s (see, Section 6, supra), several other federal a nd state laws bear on the tactic of prescription trolling. First and foremost, this activity runs afoul of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder (HIPAA), which limit the disclosure of PHI by covered entities, including pharmacies and PBMs,151 without patient authorization.152 In the absence of a valid authorization, disclosures of PHI may only be made for purposes of treatment, payment, or health care operations of the covered entity.153 As such, a PBM's access to and use of PHI to steer patients toward the PBM's wholly -owned or affiliated pharmacy is a breach154 of HIPAA, and compromises the privacy and security of patients' personal information. HIPAA provides, in addition to substantial civil penalties , criminal sanctions for the use of PHI in this way,155 which demonstrates t he significance of maintaining patient privacy . In addition, these practices likely violate many states' Anti -Patient Steering Laws which prohibit PBM or insurer -owned or affiliated pharmacies from \"steering\" profitable prescriptions to their own affiliated PBM and insurance pharmacies . For example, Louisiana provides that a PBM shall not directly or indirectly engage in patient steering to a pharmacy in which the PBM maintains an ownership interest or control without making a written disclosu re and receiving acknowledgment from the patient; and the PBM is further prohibited from retaliation or further attempts to influence the patient, or treat the patient or the patient's claim any differently if the patient chooses to use the alternate pharm acy.156 Likewise, New Jersey makes it unlawful for a pharmacist to enter into an arrangement with a health care practitioner who is licensed to issue prescriptions, or any institution, facility, or entity that provides health care services, for the purpose of directing or diverting patients to or from a specified pharmacy or restraining in any way a patient's freedom of choice to select a pharmacy.157 When the PBM engages in these underhanded tactics, it is not only directly steering the patient to a particular pharmacy without their knowledge or consent, but forcing the community oncology practice to go along with the scheme, by consenting to transfer the prescription. Lastly, even beyond state laws, prescription trolling may impinge on other federal requirements, including Section 2 of the Sherman Act (i.e., attempted monopolization using their role and leverage as PBM gatekeeper to divert business to the PBM -owned or affiliated pharmacy), and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and its requirements that fiduciaries discharge their duties with respect to the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries (misa ppropriate PHI for pecuniary gain certainly could arise to the breach of a fiduciary duty for PBMs).158 The overarching legal principles are potentially tempered somewhat by recent case law involving PBM appropriation of claims data. In Trone Health Servs., Inc. v. Express Scripts Holding Co., No. 4:18 -CV-467 RLW, 2019 WL 1207866, (E.D. Mo. Mar. 14, 2019), a retail pharmacy brought claims against Express Scripts, alleging Unfair Competition, breaches of contract, breaches of the implied covena nt of good faith and fair 151 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 160.102 \u00a7 13:39 -3.10 158 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(1) Page 115 of 367 February 2022 46 dealing, interference with economic advantage, violation of uniform trade secrets act and fraud for the practice of \"slamming,\" that is, collecting claims information received by the PBM at the point -of-sale from retail pharmacies submitting claims for their patients, and providing that same data to Express Scripts' wholly -owned mail order pharmacy for the purpose of soliciting the same patients to receive their prescriptions via mail order. The core of all the claims was Express Scripts' conduct of collecting and using prescription data to boost its mail -order operations. Parsing the \"black letter\" language of the one -sided contract of adhesion, the Judge, however, held that the conduct was not prohibited and , in fact , was express ly allowed under the terms of the agreement with the pharmacies. While the Eighth Circuit revised the standard slightly as it relates to the pharmacy provider's rights under HIPAA, the Court of Appeals ultimately upheld the lower court's decision, serving as a reminder of the unbridled power that the PBMs believe themselves to hold.159 7.3 What Can Be Done? Prescription trolling and patient slamming is perhaps one of the most deceitful of the PBM tactics and requires a response at many levels to end it once and for all : Legislati ve o Congress should e nact federal legislation which would protect patient choice of pharmacy and prohibit PBMs from requiring patients to use the mail order and specialty pharmacies they own, creating a conflict of interest, or exploiting private patient data for those purposes.160 o State lawmakers should e nact anti -steering laws like Louisiana's or Georgia's, which prohibit PBMs from directly or indirectly steering patients to a pharmacy in which the PBM maintains an ownership in terest or control.161 Regulatory o The Office of Civil Rights (OCR) should pursue complaints against PBMs and PBM - owned pharmacies for misappropriation of PHI for pecuniary gain and seek fines as well as injunctive relief. o State Boards of Pharmacy should purs ue complaints against PBMs and PBM -owned pharmacies for violations of Pharmacy Practice Acts, including anti -patient steering laws. o State Departments of Insurance should pursue complaints against PBMs and health insurers for violations of Any Willing Provi der laws, stemming from efforts to deny patients the right to receive care at the pharmacy provider of their choice . Plan Sponsor Action o Plan sponsors should n egotiate PBM contract terms to require adherence to state laws and CMS guidance . 159 Trone Health Services, Inc. v. Express Scripts Holding Co. , No. 19 -1774 (8th Cir. 2020) 160 See Generic Drug Pricing Transparency in Federal Health Programs, May 27, 2020, (available at https://scpa.memberclicks.net/assets/Lauren/hr%201316%20generic%20drug%20pricing%20transparencey%20in% 20federal%20health%20programs.pdf). 161 La.

Code Ann., \u00a7 26 -4-119 Page 116 of 367 February 2022 47 o Plan sponsors should demand that protections be given for physician -dispensed oncology medications . 8 Low-Ball Reimbursement Low-ball reimbursement - when PBMs reimburse providers less than the cost of the drug - is yet another tactic taken by PBMs to effectively exclude community oncology practice s, in order to retain and ensure a higher market share for the specialty drug mark et for their fully owned specialty pharmacies.162 Also known as \"below water\" or \"underwater\" reimbursement, PBMs intentionally lowball the reimbursement rates offered in one -sided, take -it-or-leave -it agreements with providers. No negotiation is offered. The ultimate goal of low -ball reimbursement is to allow the PBM to have it both ways: nominally \"comply\" with Any Willing Provider laws by \"offering\" open participation in the network, but in reality, effectively excluding pharm acy p roviders by pushing them to reject these unsustainable reimbursement rates, thereby diverting more patients to their wholly -owned or affiliated specialty pharmacies. While guised as a cost saving measure, PBMs actually profit off the low -ball reimbur sements . As complex, multifaceted health care entities, PBMs are able to recoup any losses that might be incurred at the dispensing level by charging plan sponsors more money through spread pricing (see, Section 4, supr a) or receiving rebates or other \"fees\" from manufacturers at the PBM level ( see, Section 3, supra ). This recently played out in the wake of the collaboration agreement between Prime Therapeutics and Express Scripts, causing low -ball, below water reimbursement for community oncol ogy practice s. On April 1, 2020, Prime Therapeutics began applying Express Scripts' lower reimbursement rates and pharmacies have been receiving abhorrently low, even negative, reimbursements. Claims specifically for lifesaving medications and limited di stribution drugs are rendered below water. Notably, in June 2020, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama (recognizing that these rates may not be sustainable) began increasing rates to independent pharmacies in Alabama for Blue Cross Blue Shield Alabama plans163 (however, this plan was the exception to the rule). Many community oncology practic es continue to face unsustainable, below cost reimbursement, which is only exacerbated when taking into account direct costs associated with pharmacy operations (such as salaries and benefits of pharmacy staff, accreditation fees, shipping, dispensing fees, supplies and equipment, license fee, pharmacy dispensing software fees and adherence and symptom management software fee, postage, etc.), and indirect overhead (including rent, utilities and telephone charges) . With the impact that this has across the industry, a question is often asked: how are PBMs able to do this? The answer is simple: their excessive market power enables them to unilaterally dictate reimbur sement rates where pharmacy providers have essentially no choice but to accept them. As noted above (see, Section 3, supra ), over 80% of the covered lives in the United States are controlled by just five PBMs.164 In some markets, a single PBM could cover over 8 5% of the patients seen by a community oncology practice. As a result of this concentration, and the inability of patients to freely select their PBM ( see, Section 3, supra ), being in network with each PBM network is critical . 162 See CVS Caremark Will No Longer Be Accepted at Walmart Pharmacies Starting In May , May 27, 2020, available at Cross increasing reimbursements for independent drug stores , June 4, 2020 367 February 2022 48 8.1 Who Is Impacted? Ultimately, the substantial and unreasonable reduction in reimbursements creates a provider \"desert ,\" making it impossible for them to stay in business because market share is shifted to PBMs. This turns patients into \"hot potatoes\" who are pass ed between different providers because no provider wants to fill medications at losses of hundreds of dollars, with scant guarantee of whether any of these downward prices are actually being passed on to plan sponsors.165 As vertically integrated models ena ble PBMs to dominate the pharmaceutical supply chain, community oncology practice s are often forced to accept reimbursement below cost because patients have no other choice but to participate in a plan that chooses 165 Adam Fein, Behind Diplomat Pharmacy's Plunge: A Primer on DIR Fees in Medicare Part D , Drug Channels (November 8, 2016), available at http://www.drugchannels.net/2016/11/behind -diplomat -pharmacys -plunge - primer.html (last visited on May 29, 2020); Eugene A. DePasquale, Bringing Transparency & Accountability to Drug Pricing (Dec. 11, 2018), at 6, 10 -16. Page 118 of 367 February 2022 49 to use one of these PBMs to manage its ph armacy benefit.166 Ultimately, low -ball reimbursement harms the provider of choice for the patient, which in turns harms the well -being of patients.167 8.1.1 Harm to Patients As a result of low -ball reimbursements, patients are often forced to receive care only from pharmacy providers owned by or affiliated with PBMs, replete with conflicts of interest between patient care and costs of service. This has had disastrous consequences. For one, it is well -established that provider participation in pharmacy networ ks will be decreased as a result of low -ball reimbursement, leaving patients with fewer choices for care.168 This, in turn, will lead to worse overall care ( see, Section 6, supra ). Worse yet, this has the possibility of turning p atient s into \"hot potatoes, \" where even contracted specialty pharmacies (including ones owned by or affiliated with PBMs) refuse to fill a patient's prescription and risk losing money. Sadly, this was the experience of many patients in the immediate wake of the Express Scr ipts- Prime Therapeutics collaboration. In one particular example involving a Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama beneficiary (whose benefits processed under Prime Therapeutics), a provider attempted to fill a prescription for one of i ts patients but was una ble to because of the unsustainable loss the below water reimbursement would have . Consequently, the provider had to attempt to transfer the patient's prescription to at least four different specialty pharmacies (including several PBM -owned or affiliated pharmac ies), in order to finally find a pharmacy that was able to fill the m edication (i.e., had access to the limited distribution drug), was contracted with the payer to be reimbursed for the prescription (i.e., held the Blue Cross Blue Shield Alabama Oncology Specialty Network contract), and was willing to accept the reimbursement (i.e., take a substantial loss on the prescription). After trying multiple pharmacies i n four states, the patient was finally able to get their medication from a specialty pharmacy located several states away. The whole process took almost two weeks to fill the medication for the patient, causing the patient to run out of her life -saving me dication . These low -ball reimbursement practices have not been limited to commercial plans. As yet another example of patients being \"hot potatoes\" with no regard for their well -being, within the TRICARE program , which was established by statute to provid e health benefits coverage to active duty and retired military service members and their dependents , community oncology practice s have reported per -fill losses of $500.00 on every prescription for Imbruvica (an oral oncolytic used to treat certain lymphoma s and leukemias), $525.00 on every prescription for Jafaki (a common oral oncolytic used to treat certain bone marrow disorders), and $740.00 on every prescription for Alecensa (an oral oncolytic used to treat lung cancer). Community oncology practices ha ve reported that over eighty percent of their TRICARE claims reimburse at or below cost, while those that reimburse above cost generally have a margin of less than one percent. As a result, this has caused veterans to become \"hot potatoes\" passed between pharmacy providers (even by PBM -owned or affiliated pharmacies), who are unwilling to fill the medication at a loss . 166 See Rutledge to Investigate Reimbursement Rates from CVS Caremark, February 9, 2018, available at https://www.pharmacist.com/article/rutledge -investigate -reimbursement -rates -cvs-caremark. 167 See National Conference of State Legislatures, Heal th Insurers and Access to Health Care Providers: Any Willing Providers, November 5, 2014, available at http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/any -willing -or-authorized - providers.aspx. 168 See Statement for the Record: The National Community Pharmacists Associa tion, United States H.

Page 119 of 367 February 2022 50 8.1.2 Harm to P lan Sponso rs As noted, any so -called benefits or savings are nebulous at best. In reality, vertically -integrated PBMs are able t o take a \"loss\" at the pharmacy level, and make up for it by overcharging the plan sponsor. The anticompetitive nature of low -ball reimbursements further allows PBMs to receive \"off invoice\" discounts and manufacturer payments that help offset the low and under water reimbursement rates at the pharmacy level. For example, PBM -owned or affiliated pharmacies can be willing to nominally \"accept\" the same reimbursement terms applicable to other pharmacy providers, but they are able to recoup those \"losses\" by either obtaining discounts from the manufacturer in drug purchases (which are not passed through to the plan sponsor), or simply utilizing spread pricing which is where the PBM charg es the plan sponsor an amount much higher than what is paid to the provider and pocketing the profits, or the \"spread,\" for itself ( see, Section 10, infra). In a recent examples, patients and providers have studied Explanations of Benefits (EOBs ) and identified instances where a PBM or health insurance company issued, in essence, two separate EOBs for the same claim: one to the provider and one to the patient. The EOBs transmitted to the provider showed the actual amounts being paid, while the one to the patient made it appear as though a much larger amount was being paid by the plan sponsor to the provider. In reality, PBM was simply keeping the difference. Thus, PBMs are using the plan sponsor's money to profit from driving independent pharmac y prov iders out o f the marketplace. Ultimately, the fact that p lan sponsor s will not experience increased savings will lead to fewer p harmacy p roviders in the network, making it more difficult for plan sponsors to get fair terms in the future .169 8.1.3 Harm to Providers The harm of low -ball reimbursement to community oncology practice s is self -evident . Each day, more and more community pharmacy providers go out of business due to negative margins as a result of reimbursements below the acquisition and dispensing costs of the prescriptions they provide to patients .170 Providers often times are not able to pick and choose which rates they will accept and which ones they will not. As a result, if providers challenge low -ball reim bursement at the initial contracting stage, PBMs will likely exclude the provider from the network. For community oncology practice s, that means they would be unable to dispense oral chemotherapy to patients.171 Likewise, when providers have raised concern s about unsustainable reimbursement rates after agreeing to participate, they risk being immediately and summarily terminat ed without cause.172 For practices that choose to stay and accept the low-ball reimbursement rates, they experience a reduction in the ability to provide enhanced services and coordinate patient care, as a direct result of the under water 169 See, The Top 15 Specialty Pharmacies of 2018: PBMs Keep Winning, May 27, 2020, available at https://www.drugchannels.net/2019/04/the -top-15-specialty -pharmacies -of-2018.html. 170 See Linette Lopez, Business Insider, What CVS i s doing to mom -and-pop pharmacies in the US will make your blood boil , May 27, 2020, online internet at https://www.businessinsider.com/cvs -squeezing -us-mom -and-pop- pharmacies -out-of-business -2018 -3.

Page 120 of 367 February 2022 51 reimbursements.173 And when combined with the heightened credentialing standards necessary to even seek admission to these networks, providers face a v eritable Catch -22 of having to choose between undertaking the high costs and extra workload of becoming accredited in order to participate in the network, only to then become unable to afford to perform the required services because of low reimbursement once admitted.174 8.2 What Does the Law Say? As in the case of restrictive networks and unreasonable barriers of entry (see, Section 6, supra ), federal and state Any Willing Provider laws can offer protection against low -ball reimbursement to the extent they require PBMs to offer participation on \"reasonable\" and \"relevant\" terms and conditions. In this regard, as it relates to the federal Any Willing Provider law, CMS expressly recognized that unreasonably low reimbursement terms, which would inc lude below water reimbursements, violate the federal Any Willing Provider law.175 This serves as a strong rebuke to low -ball reimbursement in the Medicare Part D space. Recognizing this as a growing problem in the private commercial insurance sector, many states have passed \"Fair Price Laws.\" For example, the recently enacted New Jersey law, codified at N.J.S.A. 17b:27f -1 to -10, provide PBM pricing transparency and strengthen the rights of pharmacies to contest below -cost reimbursement . Likewise, Arkansas law prohibits PBMs from setting the price for certain generic medications below available pharmacy acquisition costs.176 Several unfair trade and unfair competition laws may also be implicated by a PBM's conduct of setting below water reimbursement to increase market share for its wholly -owned or affiliated specialty pharmacy. For example, under California's Unfair Competition Law (UCL), Section 1702 of the California Business and Professions Code, known as the \"Unfair Competition Law\" or \"UCL,\" \"any person who engages, has engaged, or proposes to engage in unfair competition may be enjoined in any court of competent jurisdiction.\" Finally, to the extent such PBM's low -ball reimb ursement is deemed to be seeking monopolization, Section II of the Sherman Antitrust Act may be implicated as well.177 The Sherman Act provides that it is unlawful to \"monopolize, or attempt to monopolize ... any part of the trade or commerce among the seve ral states, or with foreign nations.\"178 And further, in t he context of state-level UCL claim s, conduct may also be deemed to be \"unfair\" under the UCL if it is \"conduct that threatens an incipient violation of an antitrust law, or violates the policy or s pirit of one of those laws because its effects are comparable to or the same as a violation of the law, or otherwise significantly threatens or harms competition.\"179 173 See Jason Hoffman, PharmD, RPh, In -House Specialty Pharmacies Improve Quality of Care, available at -care/in -house -specialty -pharmacies - improve -quality May 30, 2020). 174 See -in-Pharmacy/2019/September2019/lessons - learned -starting -a-healthsystem -oncologyfocused -specialty -pharmacy 175 See, Medicare Prescription Drug Chapter 6, Section 50.3; 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 423.505(b)(18 ). 176 17 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 Antitrust Litig ., 754 F.3d 128, 133 (2nd Cir. 2014) (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2) (alteration in original). 179 Cel-Tech Commc'n, Inc. v.

Low-ball reimbursement has the potential to fundamentally and irreparably impact our health care system for years to come, and requires action at many levels : Legislative o Congress should e nact federal legislation extending Medicare's Any Willing Provider requirements to the TRICARE program, requiring that terms and conditions be reasonable and relevant , and allow for private enforcement of these requirements. o State s should enact Any Willing Provider Laws (where none currently exist) or amend exist ing Any Willing Provider laws to require that health insurance companies and PBMs allow all pharmacy providers (including community oncology practice s) the right to participate in pharmacy networks based on \"reasonable and relevant\" terms and conditions, a pplicable to other similarly situated participating providers. o State s should enact laws, like New Jersey's Fair Price law180, requiring PBM pricing transparency and prohibiting below -cost reimbursement to pharmacies. Regulatory o CMS should pursue complaints against Part D plan sponsors and contracted PBMs for unreasonably low reimbursement in violation of the federal Any Willing Provider Law and the Medicare Part D Drug Benefit Manual , seek ing fines , Warning Letters, and injunctiv e relief. o CMS should i ssue regulation providing \"guard rails\" on what constitutes reasonable and relevant terms and conditions, and clarify that whether given terms are \"reasonable\" or \"relevant\" can be adjudicated in a private contractual dispute between Part D p lan sponsor s/PBMs and pharmacies . o State Departments of Insurance should pursue complaints against PBMs and health insurers for violations of Any Willing Provider laws, stemming from efforts to constructively deny providers the right to participate in pharmacy networks based on unreasonably low, below cost reimbursement rates . 9 Mandatory White Bagging for Cancer Medications A growing - and extremely concerning - trend that has emerged is the concept of mandatory \"white bagging\" of oncology medications that are administered in -office by community oncology practices. \"White bagging\" occurs where a physician writes a nd orders a particular medication for an in -office procedure, and rather than being sourced from the physician's medication inven tory, a separate specialty pharmacy fills a prescription, and delivers the drug directly to the prescriber or clinic who retains the medication until the patient arrives at their office for administration. Likewise, \"brown bagging,\" which is less common, involves a similar concept, except that instead of causing the prescription to be delivered directly to the community oncology practice , the specialty pharmacy 180 N.J.S.A. \u00a7 17b:27f -1 to -10 Page 122 of 367 February 2022 53 dispenses the medication to the patient him or herself, who then brings the medications into th eir physicians' offices for administration in those settings. In seeming unison, several health insurance companies (who coincidentally have integrated PBMs and specialty pharmacies) have begun to mandate that certain intravenous (IV) medications that were previously purchased by practices and administered in -office to patients, are now requiring that they be filled by the PBM -owned or affiliated specialty pharmacy through white or brown bagging . These are medications that historically have been administere d in-office by community oncology practice s and billed to patients' medical benefit (as opposed to their pharmacy benefit). Because these are IV medications , they cannot be self -administered by the patient, and still need to be infused by a health care provider. In essence, these payers (which include Anthem Blue Cross of California, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee, and Cigna) have mandated that cancer pa tients receive their chemotherapy through white or brown bagging, to be supplied by the payers ' affiliated specialty pharmacy. Each of these scenarios present immense concerns for patients, p lan sponsors and providers alike. Community oncology practices no te that white or brown bagging disrupts the chain of control of expensive cancer drugs ; risking improper storage and handling of toxic substances; can unnecessarily cause delays in the onset of treatment ; create waste when dosage s are change d to, for examp le, manage adverse events ; and places an administrative and liability burden on both patients with cancer and their oncologists.181 9.1 Who Is Impacted? 9.1.1 Harm to Patients Patients stand to suffer the greatest as a result of payer and PBM mandatory white or brow n bagging policies. Unlike instances where the community oncology practice sources the medication from its own inventory, the physician has no control over the sourcing, storage, preparation, or handling of the specialty oncology medications in white or b rown bagging situations , and as a result, patients are exposed to potentially serious harm. The community oncology practice cannot guarantee the integrity and legitimacy of the products being provided by the PBM -owned or affiliated pharmacy, especially as it relates to the shipment and delivery from the specialty pharmacy to the practice. \"The difficulties that white bagging policies place on cancer patients are a prime example of the potential harm. \"182 When medications do not follow the typical chain of custody, the integrity and safety of the medication cannot be guaranteed. When a community oncology practice sources a medication from its wholesaler to be infused in a patient, the community oncology provider is given a Transaction Report or \"T3 \" that details every single transaction involving that medication, going all the way up to the manufacturer that made it. This ensures proper pedigree at each stage along the way. When the practice receives the drug as a white bag from a PBM -owned speci alty pharmacy, it is not provided with that information. Worse yet, it has no control or insight into how the specialty pharmacy is handling that product, or how it ensured stability and integrity during the delivery process. This provides risks for pati ents receiving medications of unknown integrity, where chain of custody cannot be guaranteed. Patients also stand to be impacted by excessive delays and unnecessary burdens from white bagging when forced to receive their cancer and related treatments from PBM -owned or affiliated pharmacies (as compared to when the community oncology practice sources products from its own inventory for in -office administration) . Delays in receiving the medication past an anticipated date are commonly caused by a 181 https://communityoncology.org/coa Page 123 of 367 February 2022 54 variety of factors, including failed delivery, incorrect medications being delivered, medications shipped to the wrong address, prior authorization issues, out of stock medications, etc. When medications are sourced from the community oncology practice, issues such as drug shortages can be identified right away, and adjustments made. Requiring that the prescription be sent to and filled by a PBM -owned or affiliated specialty pharmacy can cause confusion and the potential for missed treatment doses. Finally , patient s may be subject to higher out -of-pocket liability when prescriptions are \"white bagged\" for in-office administration. In addition to having to pay the copayment or coinsurance for the administration procedure, patients will also be responsible for a separate copayment from the pharmacy associated with the dispensed drug product. Required use of the PBM -owned or affiliated specialty pharmacy means that \"reimbursement comes not from a patient's medical benefit but from the pharmacy benefit, and that ca n mean higher out -of-pocket costs for patients ,\"183 as pharmacy benefit copays are typically higher than copays under the medical benefit. Moreover, because PBM -owned or affiliated pharmacies will require patients to have paid for drugs before they are shi pped , this can interrupt critical treatment if patients cannot afford to pay for the therapies (a problem that is only exacerbated if the PBM -owned or affiliated pharmacy does not assi st the patient in qualify ing for payment assistance programs to help mee t their cost - sharing obligations , which few do ).184 Alternatively, even when everything goes \"smoothly,\" waste can result if extenuating life circumstances cause a treatment plan to be adjusted or an appointment to be rescheduled and the pre-provided \"white bagged\" medication will not still be good by the time the appointment is rescheduled. This would not occur if the community oncology practice were able to simply source the medication from its own inventory at the time of the patient's visit. 9.1.2 Harm to Plan Sponso rs The greatest harm to health care payers stemming from mandatory white bagging is in the form of excess drug waste. When a physician utilizes drugs the community oncology practice has on hand in its inventory, the physician i s able to quickly and efficiently address patient care real time and avoid waste. Oncology regimens are complex and often require dosing adjustments at the time of administration or therapy cancellation depending on the patient's laboratory results, scans, and other clinical considerations, such as shifts in the patient's weight.185 When utilizing medications from the onsite inventory, physicians are able to make these changes at the time of administration without any delays or risk of waste (they can simpl y select a different medication or dose off the shelf). However, the same cannot be said if the medications are supplied by PBM -owned or affiliated specialty pharmacies. Under white bagging mandates, the physician is required to write a \"prescription\" an d send it to the PBM's wholly -owned or affiliated specialty pharmacy to be filled. Circumstances requiring dosing adjustments or therapy cancellation could occur in the time between when an \"order\" is written by the physician, and when the medication is r eceived from a specialty pharmacy. Moreover, once the prescription has a patient - specific label, it cannot be returned to stock , unlike products kept within the practice's inventory for in - office administration. As a result, the entire medication would essentially go to waste , costing the plan sponsor and patient potentially thousands of dollars. Moreover, plan sponsors face a gr eat risk of being double bill ed when PBM -owned or affiliated pharmacies bill separately for the drug product, while community oncology practice s bill for the procedures and supplies associated with in -office administration. When a community oncology pract ice submits specialty Pharmacy. J NCCN Newwork.2010;8(Supp 4):S1 -S12. Page 124 of 367 February 2022 55 an insurer for in -office administration of a drug to its patient, it typically submits a CPT Code for the professional services associated with the administration (e.g., CPT 96413), as well as a J -Code for the medication (e.g., J9271 in the case of Keytruda). CPT Code 96413 corresponds with \"Chemotherapy administration, intravenous infusion technique, up to one hour, single or initial substance.\" Thus, when submitting claims in this manner, the physician receives his or her fee for the professional services associated with mixing the drug and administering it to the patient but is also reimbursed for the costs of the medication, the diluents, the supplies, the tubing, as well as the associated overhead. At the same time, when the PBM-owned or affiliated specialty pharmacy uses an NDC number to bill the patient's PBM, the pharmacy may also be billing (and receiving reimbursement) for overlapping products/services (which it is not actually providing or performing). Many PBM contracts prohibit pharmacies from dispensing medications in their unfinished form, and prohibit billing medications that require reconstitution (e.g., injectable medications) as compounds (suggesting that reimbursement for the diluent and other supplies necessary for administration are included within the total payment). In addition, many PBMs pay a \"dispensing fee\" on all claims in addition to the reimbursement for the drug, which is intended to cover costs that are incurred at the point of sale in excess of the ingredient cost of the drug, including the \"measurement or mixing of the drug,\" \"filling the container,\" physically providing the completed prescription patient, \"delivery,\" packaging,\" \"salaries of [workers],\" \"costs associated with maint aining the [ ] facility and acquiring and maintaining technology and equipment necessary to operate the [ ] facility.\"186 While the wholly -owned or affiliated specialty pharmacy that is white bagging will be selecting the product, processing the claim, and causing delivery to the practice, many of these items for which the wholly -owned or affiliated specialty pharmacy will be receiving reimbursement are actually tasks that will ultimately be completed by the community oncology practice . The community oncology practice will continue to be responsible for mixing the drug, procuring the diluent and other necessary supplies, and physically administering the medication to the patient. Thus, this has the r isk of the wholly -owned or affiliated specialty pharmacy being paid by the patient's PBM for the same services that are also being reimbursed by the plan sponsor to the community oncology practice (and which in fact are being performed and provided by the practice). 9.1.3 Harm to Providers Finally, the greatest harm to community oncology practice s stemming from mandated white bagging are increased, unfunded administrative burdens, along with increased legal liability which the providers have no choice but to acc ept. Community oncology practices are faced with increased administrative burdens as they are expected to undertake all work associated with preparing, diluting, and administering the drug, without being able to seek reimbursement for the medication itsel f.187 When medications are white bagged, they typically come in the original manufacturer vials. Apart from the added burdens of storing the products and maintaining them in a separate inventory (since they are patient -specific), in order to be administer ed to the patient, the products must also be mixed by the practice's staff and placed into a bag to be infused intravenously . In many instances, IV chemotherapy products are combined with other drug products, as physicians often order a \"cocktail\" of different drugs and therapies that must be taken in concert. Community oncology practices have to perform these services, despite the fact that they are not being reimbursed for the drug itself. This burden is only exacerbated when the phys ician makes changes or amendments to the treatment, often after the prescription has been written, but closer in time to when 186 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 100 187 See, Drug Table at Transmittal 10, Chapter 17 of the attached Medicare Claims Processing Manual - Payment Rules for Drugs and Biologica ls; Commun Oncol 2005; 2:173 -181 Page 125 of 367 February 2022 56 the patient is receiving care. Because the prescription has already been filled and provided by the specialty pharmacy, the pract ice's staff must engage in extra work to remedy the problem. In addition, and more concerningly, community oncology practices face additional liability for their part in prescribing and administering drugs received from outside pharmacies. In October 2012 , 64 people died and over 700 people became sick as a result of contaminated compounded steroid injections supplied by New England Compounding Center (NECC). The medications had been ordered by physicians for in -office administration to their patients in c linics and surgery centers. However, due to insanitary conditions at the pharmacy, several batches of the medications had become tainted with fungus, causing many patients to develop fungal meningitis and become seriously ill or die. In the wake of this, dozens of lawsuits (including multiple class actions) were filed against not only the pharmacy, but also the clinics, surgery centers and underlying physicians. Under current white bagging mandates, community oncology practices are forced to accept this additional risk and exposure, as \" the primary onus for patient safety remains with providers despite [PBMs and] health plans stripping those providers of their control over the quality and handling of drug therapies .\"188 With white bagging, practices no longer control t he acquisition of these medications, and as drug therapies become more complex, the reby requir ing additional resources and focus in storing, mixing, compounding and administ ering the products, they are bearing an inappropriate share of the risks.189 9.2 What Does the Law Say? In April 2018, the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy issued a report entitled \"White and Brown Bagging: Emerging Practices, Emerging Regulation\".190 The report concluded that while \"the terms and conditions of this business model are most often set by third -party payers\", issues regarding authenticity and integrity of the drug and adverse patient outcomes are left to the state boards of pharmacy to gr apple with in an effort to protect the public. As such, some state boards ( e.g., Massachusetts)191 have specifically prohibited these practices, under various provisions such as \"re -dispensing of medication\" or handling hazardous drugs. On the state level, several state legislatures have either prohibited or allowed white and brown bagging practices. F or example, Texas, Minnesota, and New York (Medicaid) have prohibited one or both of these practices . Other states like California, have laws that require health plans to demonstrate that their medical decisions are \"unhindered by fiscal and administrative management.\" At the same time, many states' laws may bear directly on arrangements mandating that community oncology practice s write prescriptions and send them to PBM -designated specialty pharmacies. For example, many states have \"Anti -Patient Steerin g\" laws, which generally prohibit health care providers from agreeing to prescriptions to a particular pharmacy. As an example, New Jersey law provides that \"[i]t shall be unlawful for a pharmacist to enter into an arrangement with a health care practitio ner, or any institution, facility or entity that provides health care services, for the purposes of directing or diverting -care 190 National Association of Boards of Pharmacy. White and Brown Bagging Emerging Practices, Emerging Regulation. April 2018. 191 247 CMR 9.01(4)(5)(6). \"Unless otherwise permitted by law, a licensee shall not re -dispense any medication which has been previously dispensed.\" \"Unless otherwise permitted by law or regulation, a licensee may not accept, store, dispense, package, label or compound any medication that was previously processed or dispensed by another pharmacy.\" Page 126 of 367 February 2022 57 patients to or from a specified pharmacy or restraining in any way a patient's freedom of choice to select a pharmacy.\"192 As another example, Georgia law likewise specifically prohibits pharmacies from presenting (and prohibits pharmacy benefits managers from paying) claims for reimbursement that were received pursuant to a referral from an affiliated PBM.193 9.3 What Can Be Done? Mandatory white bagging harms both patients and plans sponsors, while increasing liability to community oncology practice s, and requires a response at many levels: Legislative o State s should enact laws prohibiting pay er-mandated white bagging for community oncology practice s and allow patients to receive their in -office oncology medications from their treating oncologist . Regulatory o State Boards of Pharmacy should adopt regulations requiring pharmacies that fill prescriptions for white bagging obtain written consent from the physician's office prior to dispensing the medication, and have policies and procedures in place that (i) track and assur e security and accuracy of delivery for dispensed prescription s until they are administered to the patient ; (ii) provid e for counseling to patients who are administered white bagged products ; (iii) a ddress the return of any prescription medications not delivered or administered to the patient ; (iv) assur e the confidentiality of pati ent information ; (v) obtain consent from the patient for using such a delivery process through white bagging; and (vi) provide lowest number of vials wherever possible, so as to avoid excess closed -system -transfer requirements and potential USP <800> expos ures . Practical Considerations o Pharmacies providing white bagged medication should be required to assume all liability associated with the applicable medications/ prescriptions and defend/indemnify health care providers who accept white bagged medications . Plan Sponsor Action o Plan sponsors should d emand that health plans allow patients to continue to receive administered IV chemotherapy medication provided by their community oncology practice of choice. 10 Spread Pricing and Middleman P rofits Spread pricing occurs when PBMs charge plan sponsors one price for the cost of a patient's drug, while on the other side of the transaction, reimbursing the dispensing community oncology practice or pharmacy at a lower rate, while pocketing the difference, or the \"spread,\" for them selves.194 It is the classic case of the middleman mark up, but played out in a massive and extraordinarily opaque scale. This practice has 192 N.J.A.C. \u00a7 13:39 -3.10. 193 Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 26 -4-119. 194 See, e.g., In re Express Scripts, Inc., PBM Litigation , 2008 WL 2952787 *5 (E.D. Mo. July 30, 2008). Page 127 of 367 February 2022 58 recently come to light in the Medicaid context, where PBMs manage benefits for state Medi caid MCOs, and where state governments have uncovered immense spread s in drug claims for Medicaid beneficiaries .195 Ultimately, spread pricing practices reveal how PBMs are vertically integrated enterprises that control vast swathes of the drug supply chain create an anti -competitive marketplace, ultimately driving up the cost of drugs to public health programs and, ultimately, to patients themselves . 195 See, 3Axis Advisors, Sunshine in the Black Box of Pharmacy Benefits Management: Florida Medicaid Pharmacy Claims Analysis , January 30, 2020, accessible online: https://www.3axisadvisors.com/projects/2020/1/29/sunshine - in-the-black -box-of-pharmacy -benefits -management Page 128 of 367 February 2022 59 Page 129 of 367 February 2022 60 10.1 Who Is Impacted? 10.1.1 Harm to Patients Spread pricing harm s patients by increasing premiums and drug prices .196 As with many other PBM pricing strategies, spread pricing has the perverse tendency to drive drug prices up as the higher the overall drug cost is, the greater opportuni ty for the PBM to earn a larger spread . In addition, because p ricing strategies put in place by PBMs that are not equitable or uniform across different drugs, and perverse financial incentives can be created, putting patient s at risk of having pharmacy providers prioritize certain patients with certain disease states over others based on the arbitrary profitability that a PBM applies to the therapy .197 Finally, i n the context of generic drugs , where patients expect to realize the greatest pricing relief, spread pricing artificially increases the cost of such drugs, thus negating such price relief.198 10.1.2 Harm to P lan Sponsor s Plan sponsors , and in particular, state Medicaid programs , have been immensely harmed in the inflated prices they - and ultimate ly the taxpayers - have paid to PBMs because of spread pricing . Ohio was one of the first states to audit PBMs after a Columbus Dispatch expos \u00e9 revealed the extent of spread pricing in the state 's Medicaid program.199 Shortly after the news broke, the Ohio Department of Medicaid released a summary of its spread pricing analysis which showed PBMs grabbing $223.7 million in hidden pricing spreads within the Medicaid managed care program from Q2 2017 to Q1 2018, accounting for 8.8% of overall (pre -rebate) spen ding on prescription drugs.200 The Ohio revelations have led to other states and the federal government investigating spread pricing practices within their states, as well as independent efforts. State government work in Kentucky, Georgia, Virginia, and M aryland has definitively quantified spread in their states' Medicaid programs, while 3Axis Advisors - an independent pharmaceutical policy think tank - has uncovered evidence of spread pricing in 196 See generally, Neeraj Sood, et al., \"The Association Between Drug Rebates and List Prices,\" 2020, accessible online: https://healthpolicy.usc.edu/wp - content/uploads/2020/02/SchaefferCenter_RebatesListPrices_WhitePaper.pdf 197 3Axis Advisors, Sunshine in the Black Box of Pharmacy Benefits Management: Florida Medicaid Pharmacy Claims Analysis , 1, 3 -4, January 30, 2020 https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5c326d5596e76f58ee234632/t/5e384f26fc490b221da7ced1/158074859803 5/FL+Master+Final+Download.pdf.

In Ohio, the same state to expose $223.7 million in excess charges through spread pricing, many independent pharmacies were reporting such severe loses on Med icaid prescriptions that it made it virtually impossible to continue to participate in the program.202 The exposure of these abuses led 201 See 3Axis Advisors, Sunshine in the Black Box of Pharmacy Benefits Management: Florida Medicaid Pharmacy Claims Analysis , January 30, February 2022 62 Ohio Medicaid to require certain PBMs, including CVS Caremark, to increase the amount of reimbursements being paid to in dependent providers (who up until that point, were pocketing the immense spreads).203 10.2 What Does the Law Say? Given the perverse impact of spread pricing upon patients, payers, and providers, CMS' Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) managed care's final rule204 adopted standards for the calculation of Medical Loss Ratios (MLRs).205 More specifically, the final r ule clarified that spread pricing must be reported and included in the calculation of MLRs, which represents the percent of premium revenue that goes toward actual claims and activities that improve health care quality, as opposed to administrative costs a nd profits. CMS regulations require Medicaid and CHIP managed care plans to report a MLR and use and MLR target of 85 percent in developing rates. A number of states have implemented measures to prevent PBMs from utilizing spread pricing schemes when contracting with state Medicaid managed care plans. For example, Ohio Medicaid directed its five managed care plans to terminate contracts with PBMs wi th spread pricing model and enter into new contracts with PBMs with transparent \"pass -through\" model in 2018.206 In similar vein, Nevada has enacted transparency bill specifying that a PBM has a fiduciary duty to a third party that contracts with the PBM f or pharmacy benefit management services and must notify the third party in writing of any activity, policy, or practice of the PBM that creates a conflict of interest that interferes with the PBM's ability to discharge its fiduciary duty.207 New York is also planning to no longer use PBMs and instead, to use fee for service to pay for its prescription drugs.208 10.3 What Can Be Done? The practice of spread pricing by PBMs has recently become an area of focus for plan sponsors seeking to reign in PBM abuses an d reduce costs. Potential solutions to spread pricing include: Legislation o Congress should e nact federal legislation that would require pass -through pricing for covered outpatient drug prescriptions in Medicare Part D and in Medicaid (including managed care ). https://www.ohiopharmacists.org/aws/OPA/pt/sd/news_article/152198/_PARENT/layout_interior_details/false; https://www.dispatch.com/news/20191210/1600 -pharmacies Catherine Candisky, 'Medicaid orders drug price changes after more abuse reported ,' The Columbus Dispatch, https://www.the and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Programs; Medicaid Managed Care, CHIP Delivered in Managed Care, and Revisions Related to Third Party Liability; Final Rule, 81 Fed.

Regulatory o Like in Ohio, state regulators should take immediate action, where such action is permitted under enabling statutes, to prevent state Medicaid plans from contracting with PBMs using spread pricing methodology. o The FTC should e nhance oversight and revise antitrust guidance defining impermissible vertical integration structures which could, at the very least, curb the most bl atant PBM anti-competitive behavior. Plan Sponsor Action o Plan sponsors should i mplement robust Request for Proposal procedure to select transparent PBMs. o Plan sponsors should r eview and negotiate transparent contract terms including, without limitation, an exclusive pricing benchmark. o Plan sponsors should r equire PBMs to provide reporting of reimbursements paid to the pharmacies on pharmacy claims and the corresponding charges made to the plan sponsor. 11 Copay Accumulators and Maximizers The increase d prevalence of high deductible health plans or plans involving patient coinsurance209 has left more and more Americans finding themselves with significant annual out-of-pocket copayments, coinsurance obligations or deductibles for their medications . Many patients struggle to meet their deductible and pay the copays for the high -cost drugs they need to treat serious, sometimes life - threatening, illnesses like cance r. In a study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology , the researchers found that drug abandonment and adherence problems are increasingly prevalent in patients prescribed an oral cancer medication due to higher out -of-pocket costs.210 To help offse t these costs - especially in the oncology space, where copayments can range in the thousands of dollars - many drug manufacturers have created copay discount cards to reduc e the net out -of-pocket amount to a figure that is affordable to many patients. However, beginning in 2018, several large insurance companies and PBMs began to implement a nefarious new set of schemes Patient Out -of-Pocket Costs With Prescription Abandonment and Delay in Fills of Novel Oral Anticancer Agen ts Jalpa A.

Thus, after several fills of a high -cost specialty medication, the deductible would be exhausted, and the patient's out -of-pocket would be lowered to an affordable amount. This is important, because many drug manufacturers' copay coupon programs have annual limits or caps, preventing patients from receiving unlimited copayment assistance. Without copay accumulator programs, patients are able to afford their prescriptions throughout the whole year. Conversely, when a copay accumulator program is implemented, the amounts of the patient's copay that have been funded by a drug company (through a copay coupon program) no longer count towards the patient's out -of-pocket limits. The result is that, after th e patient exhausts the benefits from the manufacturer's copay coupon program, the patient is still left with excessively high copayment obligations. The financial impact of copay accumulator programs is demonstrated well in an example. Consider an example where a patient is prescribed a drug that costs $36,000 per year, or $3,000 per month. The patient obtains a copay coupon card from the drug's manufacturer, with an assistance limit of $12,000 per year. The patient's benefit plan has a $3,000 deductible and, after the deductible has been met, a monthly copay of $500.212 Without the copay accumulator program, the drug manufacturer would cover the $3,000 deductible in month one (January), and $500 per month each month thereafter. The patient would never run out of benefits under the copay coupon program, and would never be saddled with excessive out -of- pocket costs, significantly reducing the risk of therapy abandonment. With the copay accumulator program in place, however, the patient would use the copay co upon to cover the monthly drug costs in months one through four (i.e., January through April), and would have no out -of- pocket expenses during those first four months of the year. However, because the copay accumulator program would prevent the amounts re ceived through the coupon from applying toward cost -sharing requirements, the patient would still be required to pay the full deductible amount ($3,000) in month five (May), and monthly copays of $500 per month thereafter. In essence, the maximum benefits under the copay coupon program would have been exhausted at the end of April (having funded $3,000 per month).213 Here, when the patient is now saddled with a $3,000 bill to continue therapy he or she has been on for four months, there is tremendous risk o f therapy abandonment. These programs have been called a variety of things by different entities, including \"Out -of-Pocket Protection Programs\" (Express Scripts), \"True Adjustment: Benefit Plan Protection Program\" (UnitedHealthcare).214 However, the main thrust has been to place financial roadblock in the way of patients receiving necessary care, with dubious savings being realized by plan sponsors. Another related concept that has emerged in response to the negativ e patient impact from accumulators is that programs.\" Like copay accumulator programs, copay maximizer programs are designed to allow payers to \"extract the full value of the manufacturer's copay 2022 65 swap the \"f inancial cliff\" that the patients face under accumulator programs, in favor of a slow and steady drain of resources, without any marked benefits to the patient. For example, assume again a situation where a patient is prescribed a drug that costs $36,000 per year, and there is a manufacturer -sponsored copay coupon with an assistance limit of $12,000 per year (or $1,000 per month). In the context of a copay maximizer, the patient will still have a deductible of $3,000, but instead of a standard copay, the plan will set the monthly copay to slightly more than the coupon's value, to, say, $1,200 per month. Each month, the patient will be responsible for $200 out -of-pocket (the difference between what is covered by the copay coupon and the set copay amount).216 Worse yet, to the extent maximizer programs do actually deliver copay savings to the patient, it invariably comes with underhanded restrictions, obligating the patient to obtain the prescription exclusively from the PBM -owned or affiliated pharmacy, a nd allowing PBM subsidiaries to reap additional revenue.217 PBMs have created \"secretive and independent private companies\" to operate these specialty drug maximizer programs, who sometimes take fees equal to 25% of the manufacturer's copay support program .218 In each of these scenarios, however, the patient is either forced to go over the \"financial cliff\" in the middle of the year (when their copays skyrocket) and risk drug abandonment, or is forced to utilize a PBM -owned or affiliated pharmacy with limite d real financial benefits (or face exorbitant out -of-pocket costs). 11.1 Who Is Impacted? Copay accumulator and maximizer programs have clear negative impact on all stakeholders. 11.1.1 Harm to Patients The harm of copay accumulators and maximizer programs is felt most acutely by patients - especially cancer patients. Unlike instances where there might be lower cost generics available to be used as alternatives when a brand manufacturer's copay coupon benefits expire, there are no alternatives for the high -priced oncology medications, and when manufacturer copay coupon programs run out as a result of copay accumulator programs, \"the individuals who need assistance the most will be unable to receive it, and will end up paying more for their treatments.\"219 \"This poses an adverse impact on adherence to medication regimens, especially when a support mechanism is not in place.\"220 Studies have shown that patients impacted by copay accumulator programs fill their prescription 1.5 fewer times than patients who are not impacted.221 More critically, data has shown that patients impacted by copay accumulator programs have experienced a 13% drop in adherence - that is, they've fallen off therapy - between months 3 and month 4 of a plan year (coinciding with when they of 367 February 2022 66 reach the annual cap for manufacturer -sponsored copay coupon programs).222 This is significant as over 75% of impacted patients have said that their adherence will suffer as a result of these programs.223 These findings and observations of direct patient harm hav e been backed up by literature. In a study published in the American Journal of Managed Care , the authors found that after the implementation of copay accumulator programs, Health Savings Account patients on certain high -cost specialty drugs had \"signific antly lower monthly fill rates, higher risk of discontinuation, and lower [percentage of days covered],\" suggesting that copay accumulator programs have \"the potential to negatively affect specialty drug use.\"224 This rings true in the cancer context as we ll. According to a study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, nearly half of patients with cancer abandon their prescriptions when out -of-pocket costs reach $2,000.225 Nonadherence can have dire consequences to patients, and accounts for 10% of hospitaliza tions and 125,000 deaths each year.226 Perhaps the best evidence of patient harm is the stories from the patients themselves. In one instance, a nurse case manager from Ohio with multiple sclerosis had long managed her disease with medications, and was able to afford them through copay coupon programs.227 However, in May 2018, she discovered that her health plan had instated a copay accumulator program, that required her to pay $3,600 per month for her prescription drugs until she met an $8,800 deductibl e, forcing her to consider rationing her medication that allowed her to function in her daily life.228 In another well -publicized incident, a 27 -year -old hemophilia patient had been able to afford the $38,000 for his maintenance drugs with the assistance o f manufacturer copay coupon programs. 229 However, once his health plan instituted a copay accumulator program, he was unable to afford the $6,350 deductible. 230 As a result of his immediate and unforeseen inability to afford the medications, he was left wi th untreated bleeds, resulting in internal bleeding, and needing additional surgeries to correct. 231 \"The patient has been in and out of the hospital, is currently in a wheelchair, and is not working, all at a cost of $3.5 million.\"232 One of perhaps the mo st sinister aspects of copay accumulator and maximizer programs for patients is the overall lack of transparency. These programs lack any semblance of transparency, and are \"often implemented without a patient's knowledge or full understanding of their new 'benefit.'\"233 Ultimately, because patient receiving medications that have lower -cost generic products have the ability to switch to such generic products in the face of copay accumulator and maximizer programs, Mittal M. Impact of a co -pay accumulator adjustment program on specialty drug adherence. Am J Manag Care . 2019;25(7):335 -340, available at https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31318506/ 225 Association of Patient Out -of-Pocke t Costs With Prescription Abandonment and Delay in Fills of Novel Oral Anticancer Agents, Jalpa A. Doshi, Pengxiang Li, Hairong Huo, Amy R. Pettit, and Katrina A. Armstrong Journal of Clinical Oncology 2018 67 sickest patients requiring the hig hest -priced drugs that are most egregiously affected by these programs, and are in essence \"subsidizing the patients who are adequately served by lower -cost pharmaceuticals that have low or no copays.\"234 11.1.2 Harm to P lan Sponso rs When the PBMs created and rol led out copay accumulator programs, they were billed as a cost savings tool for plans sponsors, such as employers. In theory, it does make sense when applied to high -cost branded medications, when a lower -cost, equally effective generic product is availab le. These programs counteract manufacturer efforts to retain market share for brand drugs once generics have become available, and further the interests of pushing patients to lower cost alternatives. However, in the oncology space, cancer care is for li fe saving treatment and does not have the same risks of \"overutilization ,\" nor are there cheaper alternatives available. Instead, the result of copay accumulator or maximizer programs is that the harms and additional costs to plan sponsors caused by drug abandonment and non -adherence will far outweigh any potential savings to be gained from them . From increased hospitalizations, additional treatments, and more catastrophic care, it is well -established that plan sponsors save money w hen patients stay adherent to the drugs they are prescribed. This is especially true in the cancer context, where studies have suggested that the increased plan costs caused by non -adherence due to copay accumulator programs was more than double than that of all other disease groups.235 Worse yet, many employers and plan sponsors do not even know what they are getting or whether such program s have been instituted. While nearly 20% of commercial medical insurance policies sold in 2018 will have copay accumulator/maximizer programs built in, \"most employers who have purchased/are purchasing these plans are unaware these programs are present in the c overage\" and \"have no idea how it will adversely affect their employees' care.\"236 This is especially alarming considering the secretive operations of copay maximizer programs, where the prescription is typically required to be filled at the PBM -owned or affiliated pharmacy, and related or affiliated companies take up to 25% of the copayment assistance made available by the manufacturer. For example, with Express Scripts' SaveonSP program, a commercial plan sponsor declares specialty drugs to be \"non -esse ntial health benefits,\" making them covered by the plan, but not subject to out -of-pocket maximums mandated by the Affordable Care Act.237 In turn, the patients' out -of-pocket costs are set to the maximum annual value of a manufacturer's copay coupon progr am.238 \"For instance, a program with a total value of $20,000 in copayment support would require a patient to pay $20,000 annually for their drugs, without regard to the plan's out -of-pocket maximums.\"239 Thereafter, to avoid these inflated costs, the benef iciaries must enroll separately in the SaveonSP program, and have their prescriptions filled exclusively by Express Scripts' Accredo specialty pharmacy.240 SaveonSP then charges L., Fernandez -Llimos, F., Frommer, M., Benrimoj, C., & Garcia -Cardenas, V. (2018). Economic impact of medication non -adherence by disease groups : a systematic February 2022 68 of the copayment support, or $5,000 in the above example.241 This is in addition to the profit generated by Express Scripts' wholly -owned pharmacy by filling the prescription.242 Ultimately, while copay accumulator and maximizer programs might seem like a good short term solution, the devil is in the details, and i n reality, these programs will ultimately increase costs for plan sponsors in the long run, including increased hospitalizations, additional care, and overall increases to drug prices. 11.1.3 Harm to Providers Finally, community oncology practice s are harmed by manipulative copay accumulator and maximizer practices as well. When physicians prescribe a particular oncology treatment to be dispensed out of the community oncology practice , they undertake a \"difficulty and time -consuming process\" involved in finding financial assistance for their patients.243 This includes finding manufacturer -sponsored copay coupon programs, providing resources to patients, and potentially providing supporting documentation to these programs. The copay accumulator and maximiz er programs will add additional complexities in the patient coverage process and will only increase \"the administrative burden on practice staff, who will now need to understand the nuances of co -pay accumulators and maximizers; as well as help explain to patients why some of the assistance is not helping them to reach their deductible.\"244 In addition, community oncology practice s are further impacted when their patients discontinue prescribed therapy due to cost. Many community oncology practice s are cont racted with payers under value -based arrangements, where they take responsibility - and sometimes risk - for the outcomes of patients. If a patient stops taking his or her therapy once the copay coupon program is exhausted, that patient may wind up in the hospital or needing additional care. This will in turn negatively impact community oncology practice s' performance under value -based contracts. 11.2 What Does the Law Say? Federal statutory law is silent on the issue of copay accumulator and maximizer program s. However, in 2019, HHS finalized the Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2020 (NBPP 2020), which only allowed health plans to implement copay accumulator programs when both a brand and generic medication were available. In essence, this would have allowed plans to steer patients to less costly, generic medications when possible, but would provide protections for patients - including cancer patients - who did not have access to alternative, less costly medications.245 However, on May 7, 2020, HH S released its Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2021 Final Rule, which clarified certain confusion created by different agencies' guidance, and now allows health plans to implement copay accumulator programs regardless of whether or not a gener ic alternative is available. When patients cannot afford their medications, they may rely on copay assistance (i.e., coupon cards from drug manufacturers). These coupon cards not only contribute toward the patient's copay but also February 2022 69 toward the patient' s annual deductible.246 Thus, as of July 30, 2020, HHS has not only allowed health plans to implement these programs but has removed key protections for cancer patients. Fortunately, however, several states have enacted their own laws governing copay accum ulators (importantly, in NBPP 2021, HHS explicitly stated that the Final Rule does not preempt state laws that govern the use of copay accumulator programs in state -regulated health plans). At this time, four states (Illinois, West Virginia, Virginia, and Arizona) have enacted copay accumulator legislation. While these apply to state -regulated plans (and not to Exchange -based health plans), they provide protection against certain PBM conduct. For example, Virginia Statute \u00a7 38.2 -3407.20 requires health pl ans to include any amount paid by or on behalf of a plan enrollee when calculating an enrollee's overall contribution to any out -of-pocket maximum or any cost -sharing requirement to the extent permitted by federal law and regulation. Likewise, in Illinois , 215 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 134/30 requires health plans to apply any contributions (i.e., third -party payments, financial assistance, discount, product vouchers, or any other reduction in out -of-pocket expenses) for prescription drugs made by or on behalf of an enrollee toward that person's deductible, copay, or cost - sharing responsibility, or out -of-pocket maximum. An additional eight state s have some form of legislation pending to address copay accumulator/maximizer programs. 11.3 What Can Be Done? Legislative o State should e nact laws that require health plans to include any amount paid by or on behalf of a plan enrollee when calculating an enrollee's overall contribution to any out - of-pocket maximum or any cost -sharing requirement. Regulatory o HHS s hould r escind the Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2021 Final Rule, and institute Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters that, at the very least, reinstates, strengthens, and clarifies the protections for patients receiving medications withou t lower cost alternatives. Plan Sponsor Action o Plan sponsors should i nquire with PBM whether copay accumulator and/or maximizer programs are being employed, and demand that protections be given for oncology medications that lack lower cost alternatives. 12 Maximum Allowable Cost (MAC) Pricin g Maximum Allowable Cost pricing, or \"MAC,\" is one of the most significant and challenging issues facing independent pharmacies throughout the United States today. While not as impactful to community oncology practice s providing cancer care as many of the o ther topics addressed in this expos \u00e9, MAC has nevertheless become one of the most manipulated and opaque methods by which PBMs control 246 See, Page 139 of 367 February 2022 70 reimbursement to independent pharmacies and has become a catalyst for legislative efforts to rein in PBM conduct. MAC i s typically defined as the maximum amount of money that PBM will pay a pharmacy for certain multi - source drugs, typically multi -source generic drugs.247 It is well established that generic drugs make up the vast majority of drugs dispensed throughout the U nited States. For example, according to the Association for Accessible Medicines, generic drugs account for approximately 89% of all prescription drugs dispensed in the United States.248 Thus, generic drugs constitute the majority of drugs dispensed to pat ients throughout the United States meaning MAC pricing present a significant issue as it pertains to provider reimbursement.249 MAC began as a mechanism to save money in health care and incentivize selective and intelligent purchasing practices , but MAC ha s since evolved over time into a PBM tool that can be manipulated by PBMs to increase revenues in several different ways.250 MAC pricing is a PBM created pricing benchmark - MAC prices and MAC lists are prepared exclusively by PBMs and considered by the PBM s to be proprietary and confidential.251 Moreover, PBM -set MAC rates need not have any relationship to a drug's market clearing acquisition cost.252 As such, the creation and publication of PBM MAC prices and MAC lists are shielded from the public and avoid public scrutiny.253 PBMs' ability to keep MAC lists and MAC prices from the public has enabled PBMs to utilize MAC pricing to increase their revenues and to effectuate certain PBM practices that lead to higher revenues, including the PBM practice of spread pricing, wherein a PBM reimburses a pharmacy provider one price for a drug but collects a higher amount from the plan sponsor and retains the difference.254 The fact that MAC pricing is shrouded in secrecy , and there is no requirement for MAC rates to have any basis in real costs, creates substantial profit opportunities for PBMs and has resulted in substantial challenges for independent pharmac y provider s over the past several years. 247 See, e.g. , NY PUB HEALTH \u00a7 280 -a(1)(b). 248 Assoc. for Accessible Medicines, Generic Drug Access & Savings in Rutledge , 240 F.Supp.3d 951, 961 (E.D.

Page 140 of 367 February 2022 71 12.1 Who Is Impacted? PBMs' secretive MAC pricing tactics have caused harm to payers, providers, and most critically to patients. 12.1.1 Harm to Patients The i mproper use of MAC pricing tactics harm patients throughout the United States by limiting patient care access - this specific issue is on display in the case Rutledg e v. PCMA which successfully went before the Supreme Court of the United States in December of 2020 .255 In Rutledge , Arkansas enacted a law, Act 900, with the purpose of addressing this patient -based issue, which was especially pronounced in rural areas.256 MAC pricing appears to often disproportionately harm patients in rural areas, who often do not have access to a broad catalogue of different (sometimes cheaper) products, thereby harming these patients specifically.257 \"MAC methodologies are resu lting in pharmacies closing down, especially in rural 255 See, e.g. , PCMA v. Rutledge , 240 F.Supp.3d 951, 960 -61 (E.D. Ark. 2017). 256 Id. 257 Id. at 960. Page 141 of 367 February 2022 72 areas . . . [and] approximately 44% of Arkansans live in rural areas.\"258 The potential for patient harm based upon improper pricing and reimbursement tactics, including MAC pricing combined with spread pricing was also discussed at length in the Pennsylvania Auditor General's Report on PBMs, wherein it was noted that \"small pharmacies often see the most vulnerable patients . . . [a]nd if small pharmacies are forced out of business, these patients will h ave to travel greater distances to get the medications they need[.]\"259 Thus, there is ample objective evidence that PBMs' MAC pricing tactics are causing harm to patient populations throughout the United States and that this harm may be particularly prono unced in rural settings . 12.1.2 Harm to P lan Sponso rs In addition to harming patients, improper MAC pricing tactics by PBMs also potentially harm all payers including Medicare, Medicaid, employers, and taxpayers , although studies indicate this may be particularl y pronounced in the Medicaid context.260 \"PBMs' control of MAC definitions allows them to manipulate the MAC concept in whatever ways they choose.\"261 Thus, MAC lists do not afford payers and sponsors with the ability to have predictability or in any way g uarantee savings but instead give PBMs unfettered discretion to control precisely which drugs are on a particular MAC list and to ensure only those drugs which they are making money on remain on the list and those which they are not are removed from the li st. In assessing potential harm of PBMs' MAC pricing tactics, it is important to note that MAC pricing applies to drugs, most commonly generics, and not to specific programs (e.g., Medica id.262 The implication is that improper MAC pricing tactics can affect all payers, including federal and state governments , and by extension , taxpayers.263 As mentioned, MAC pricing is one of the primary methods by which PBM spread pricing is effectuated, wherei n the PBM bills a plan sponsor one price and reimburses the pharmacy provider a lower amount.264 Several studies have shown that improper MAC pricing tactics, in connection with spread pricing, has been prominent in the Medicaid context, including in Flori da, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New York, Ohio, and Virginia.265 Pennsylvania's report on PBMs noted that in 2017 \"three PBMs made between $2 million and nearly $40 million on spread pricing, earning average profits between 28 cents an d almost $13 per Medicaid prescription filled.266 258 Id. 259 Eugene A.

Page 142 of 367 February 2022 73 In order to implement spread pricing via MAC pricing, PBMs create numerous different MAC lists including separate MAC lists for each individual payer as well as separate MAC lists for PBM network providers which enables a PBM to bill a plan sponsor one rate but pay the pharmacy a separate and frequently a much lower rate.267 Florida, Michigan, New York, and Ohio are three states that exemplify the harm caused by PBM MAC pricing tactics to state specific Med icaid programs . 12.1.3 Harm to Providers Finally, improper MAC pricing tactics by PBMs also harm providers due to unsustainable reimbursement by PBMs.268 In Rutledge , the District Court acknowledged that numerous pharmacies had been harmed by these tactics and were closing down,269 noting that \"[i]ndependent community pharmacies have had to eliminate employees during the last five to ten years due to the financial hardships they have faced.\"270 The court further noted that \"[i]ndependent community pharmacies in A rkansas are in economic distress.\"271 These unreasonably low MAC prices are further exacerbated by the fact that PBMs are often slow to make price adjustments to MAC drugs when there are market conditions that would result in the PBM reimbursing a higher amount (i.e., an increase in acquisition cost), but relatively quick to make price adjustments based on market conditions that would result in the PBM reimbursing a lesser amount (i.e., a decrease in acquisition cost).272 12.2 What Does the Law Say? Given its pr evalence in commercial insurance contracts and Medicaid programs, MAC pricing has largely been regulated by the state s. Currently, 36 state s have some form of MAC law or MAC appeal law in place.273 While the different state laws vary in the level of prote ctions they afford to pharmacies regarding MAC, there are several general characteristics in these state MAC laws. Typically, robust MAC laws will establish criteria for placing a drug on a MAC list, establish an appeal process for challenging questionable MAC pricing, and set requirements for updating MAC lists. Texas and Georgia are example of such laws.274 In Texas, a PBM may not include a drug on a MAC list unless: (1) the drug: (A) has an \"A\" or \"B\" rating in the most recent version of the United Stat es FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, also known as the Orange Book; or (B) is rated \"NR\" or \"NA\" or has a similar rating by a nationally recognized reference; and (2) the drug is: (A) generally available for purchase by pharmacists and pharmacies in [Texas] from a national or regional wholesaler; and (B) not obsolete.275 Further, the PBM 267 3AXIS Advisors, Sunshine in the Black Box of Pharmacy Benefits Management: Florida Medicaid Pharmacy Claims Analysis (January 2020), https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5c326d5596e76f58ee234632/t/5e384f26fc490b221da7ced1/158074859803 5/FL+Master+Final+Download.pdf. 268 See, e.g. , PCMA v.

Page 143 of 367 February 2022 74 must develop a process for pharmacies to appeal MAC prices of a drug on or before the 10th day after the claim is submitted and the PBM must respond within 10 days.276 Texas' MAC appeal requirements also require that when an appeal is successful, the PBM must (1) adjust the MAC that is the subject of the appeal effective on the day after the date the appeal is decided; (2) apply the adjus ted MAC price to all similarly situated pharmacies as determined by the PBM; and (3) allow the pharmacy that succeeded in the appeal to reverse and rebill the pharmacy benefit claim giving rise to the appeal.277 When appeals are not successful, the PBM must identify and disclose (1) each reason the appeal was denied; and (2) the NDC number from the national/regional wholesalers from which the drug is generally available for purchase by pharmacies in Texas at the MAC price that is the subject of the appeal.278 Moreover, in Texas, there are separate guidelines governing MAC in the Medicaid context.279 Although there are some functions an MCO may delegate to a PBM in Texas, there are also certain functions for which an MCO is ultimately responsible despite the delegable nature of the function.280 These expressly include \"negotiation and establishment of pharmacy provider reimbursement rates [and] cultivation and maintenance of MAC pricing lists.\"281 Thus, certain law s in the Medicaid context potentially provide additional recourse against payers in addition to PBMs as is the case in Texas . 12.3 What Can Be Done? Effective responses to improper MAC pricing by PBMs require action at various levels: Legislative o Congress should e nact legislation at the federal level prohibiting MAC manipulation including a requirement as to transparency in MAC pricing on both sides of the PBM \u2014at the plan sponsor side as well as the provider side. o States must take more aggressive action against PBMs' MAC pricing tactics and enact new laws or else enhance existing laws that mandate transparency in reimbursement which should include robust laws that protect both plan sponsor s and providers from manipulative MAC pricing practices, esp ecially as it pertains to claims that are paid from taxpayer dollars, e.g., Medicare and Medicaid.282 o For legislative efforts to be effective, the laws enacted must provide a deterrent beyond solely relying on government enforcement. Thus, it is imperative that state s enact laws or enhance existing laws by including or adding \"private rights of action\" to ensure plan sponsors and providers have recourse against improper PBM MAC pricing tactics and also make violation of MAC laws by PBMs an unfair or deceptive trade practice act in accordance with existing state law.283 o State laws should strive for greater uniformity, including in how MAC is defined to prevent inconsistencies in reimbursement practices throughout the country, greater /broader 276 Id. 277 Id. 278 Id. 279 Texas HHSC Report on PBMs in Medicaid, Revised September 30, 2019. 280 Id. 281 Id. 282 See, e.g. , Eugene A.

Page 144 of 367 February 2022 75 appeal rights (requiring that the drug utilized as the basis for the MAC rate is readily available and conforms with t he state's prescription substitution laws) , and to ensure that PBMs cannot take liberties in placing drugs that do not meet a uniform definition of a MAC drug on a MAC list.284 o MAC laws should permit providers to choose how MAC appeals are filed rather th an permitting PBMs to force providers to use a pharmacy services administrative organization (PSAO) - this ensures that if PSAOs are not responsive to MAC issues, pharmac y prov iders can pursue the appeals on their own or hire third parties that may be more effective at addressing MAC issues .285 Regulatory o There should be i ncreased scrutiny over PBM MAC pricing tactics at the federal level through CMS/OIG audits. o Increased scrutiny over PBM MAC pricing tactics should happen at the state level through audits by both the Departments of Insurance and Departments of Health and/or state Boards of Pharmacy . Plan Sponsor Action o Plan sponsors must demand more from PBMs during the contracting process including specific information on how pharmacies are being re imbursed and the use of MAC lists as it pertains to both the plan sponsors' relationship with the PBM as well as pharmacies' relationships with the PBM to understand if spread pricing is being used and/or whether pharmacies are being harmed by improper MAC reimbursement. 13 Effective Rate Reconciliation In yet another opaque and underhanded ploy , PBMs have created and utilized the concepts of Generic Effective Rate (GER) and Brand Effective Rate (BER) to essentially reprice drugs, and claw back pharmacy reimbursements, sometimes more than a year after drugs are dispensed.286 GER and BER (collectively known as the \"Effective Rate \") measure the d iscount that the PBM contractually must deliver for its client (i.e., plan sponsors ) to a benchmark called Average Wholesale Price (AWP) for generic prescription drugs and for brand -name prescription drugs , respectively .287 However, because they are assess ed retrospectively and on a network level basis, it is tantamount to giving PBMs unbridled discretion as to how they will pay a given pharmacy, and still technically be in compliance with the reimbursement terms of the agreement. Worse yet, PBM methods of imposing and recouping Effective Rate assessments are equally deceitful. Not only did many PBMs foist such reimbursement terms o n pharmac y prov iders retroactively without their knowledge or conse nt (for example via retroactive contracts with th e pharmac y prov iders' PSAOs ), but in and NY PUB HEALTH See, e.g. , N.J.S.A. 17B:27F -4. 286 See Complaint, Total Care Rx, Inc. v. Epic Pharmacy Network, Inc ., No. 1:18 -cv-3853 (D.Md. December 14, 2018). 287 See generally , 3 Axis Advisors, \"Analysis of PBM Spread Pricing in Michigan Medicaid Managed Care,\" accessible online: https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5c326d5596e76f58ee234632/t/5cc5eb7b24a6944974537e28/15564747684 36/3AA+MI+Medicaid+managed+care+analysis+ -+Final+04.10.19.pdf Page 145 of 367 February 2022 76 many instances, the pharmac y provider s only learned of the Effective Rate reconciliation when the PBMs, either directly or indirectly, simply began withholding payments due to offset the alleged Effective Rate overpayme nts.288 Because of its after -the-fact assessment applied across an entire network of pharmac y provid ers, Effective Rates allow PBMs to circumvent Maximum Allowable Cost laws enacted by many state s (see, Section 12, supra ), and hi nders pharmacy p roviders' ability to challenge underwater reimbursements on generic prescriptions.289 At its most basic level, Effective Rate is not reflected at the point of sale and it provides an opportunity for PBMs to take back a substantial amount of reimbursements on prescription drug claims that were already dispensed to patients.290 Similarly, PBMs have also created another pricing mechanism called Dispending Fee Effective Rate (DFER) to recoup dispensing fees already paid to providers that provides no purpose to reduce plan sponsors' drug spending.291 DFER allows a PBM to pay one dispensing fee at the po int-of-sale, and afterwards claw -back a portion of this dispensing fee down to the contractually specified DFER. This particularly pernicious type of effective rate undermines the cost -plus pass -through contracts that many state Medicaid programs are conte mplating, or moving to, in response to outrage over spread pricing. DFERs could allow the PBM to pass through the state -mandated dispensing fee, only to claw it back after the fact, without the state's knowledge. 13.1 Who Is Impacted? 13.1.1 Harm to Patients As with m any other PBM tactics, including spread pricing ( see, Section 10, supra ), rebates ( see, Section 4, supra fees ( see, Section 5, supra ), Effective Rate reimbursement frameworks have the ability to increase the gross price for medications, notwithst anding a potentially lower net price. For Medicare Part D patients, Effective Rate forces them to reach \"donut hole\" and pushes patients into \"catastrophic coverage\" at a much faster rate.292 As discussed in detail below, this results in the patients bein g responsible for a greater share of the costs of the medication. 13.1.2 Harm to P lan Sponsor s While it is billed as a \"cost containment\" and pricing guarantee to payers, in actuality, Effective Rate reimbursement schemes do little to lower the overall costs of drugs. Effective Rate prices are invariably tied to percentage discounts off of reported AWP ( as shown in the graphic on page 78, an inherently unreliable pricing benchmark ), enabling PBMs to deliver on savings guarantees, while not actually lowe ring 288 See generally , Complaint, Total Care Rx, Inc. Epic Pharmacy Network, Inc ., No. 1:18 -cv-3853 (D.Md. December 14, 2018) 290 See, American Pharmacy Cooperative, Inc., \"Letter to US Department of Justice Antitrust Division,\" De cember 12, 2018, accessible online: https://www.justice.gov/atr/page/file/1142771/download 291 See, National Community Pharmacists Association, Letter to United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \"Senate HELP Committee request f or comments on the Lower Health Care Costs Act of 2019 Discussion Draft,\" June 5, 2019, accessible online: http://www.ncpa.co/pdf/qAM/help -discussion -ncpa - comments.pdf 292 See, American Pharmacy Cooperative, Inc., \"Letter to US Department of Justice Antitrus t Division,\" December 12, 2018, accessible online: https://www.justice.gov/atr/page/file/1142771/download. Page 146 of 367 February 2022 77 overall costs (as lower generic and brand -name prescription drug costs for plan sponsors would in turn lower overall revenue for PBMs ).293 An even more pernicious feature of Effective Rate pricing arrangements is that they provide PBMs with the abilit y to collect \"spread\" between what they charge their clients (e.g., employers and plan sponsors ) and what they pay their providers (e.g., pharmacies and community oncology practice s) without having to put their clients in traditional spread pricing contrac ts. Instead, PBMs can simply sign one contract with a client guaranteeing, say, an 82% discount to AWP and a different contract with their pharmacy network guaranteeing an 87% discount to AWP. Both contracts are highly confidential, so the \"buyer\" (the emp loyer) and \"seller\" (the pharmacy) of drugs does not know what each other are paying/receiving. Even if the employer demands a full pass -through contract, in which no spread is taken off the claim, the PBM will simply pass -through what it charges its clien t to the pharmacy at the time of the transaction, and then claw the overpayment back at a later time through its effective rate adjustments. At the end of the day, in this hypothetical example the PBM has locked in 5% of AWP for its services, regardless if it collects that up front or months after the transaction. The value of Effective Rate contracts to the PBM does not end there. That's because for generic drugs, AWP is designed to do exactly the opposite of what prices should do over time for generic dru gs - AWP is designed to increase, not decrease over time. So, in our hypothetical example, the hidden 5% of AWP locked in by the PBM becomes more and more valuable each year to the PBM as AWPs diverge from true generic acquisition costs. 293 See generally , 3 Axis Advisors, \"Analysis of PBM Spread Pricing in Medicaid Managed Care,\" accessible online: https://static1.squarespace. com/static/5c326d5596e76f58ee234632/t/5cc5eb7b24a6944974537e28/15564747684 36/3AA+MI+Medicaid+managed+care+analysis+ -+Final+04.10.19.pdf Page 147 of 367 February 2022 78 13.1.3 Harm to Providers As noted above, Effective Rate reimbursement has had an especially damaging impact on providers. By effectively circumventing MAC laws, PBMs are able to reimburse many pharmacies below water on claims, leaving them without any recourse to chall enge such reimbursements through legally -mandated appeals processes. This has particularly effect on providers who only dispense a limited range of generic products, such as community oncology practice s. PBMs' reconciliation of Effective Rate is a signifi cant financial hurdle to community oncology practice s because oncologists generally treat patients with a handful of drugs Page 148 of 367 February 2022 79 compared to other community retail or chain pharmacies who have a broad and diverse patient population.294 13.2 What Does the Law Say? At the federal level, in addition to the guidance on spread pricing generally ( see, Section 10, supra ), GER and BER reconciliations are properly considered Direct and Indirect Remuneration (DIR), which Medicare Part D plan sponsors must report to CMS.295 This at least , in theory , requires PBMs and Part D plan sponsors to disclose the extent and amount of GER/BER, regardless of whether it is passed -through to the plan sponsor or retained by the PBM. At a state level, many state s have enacted laws that wou ld prohibit these types of post -point -of-sale reconciliations and clawbacks with respect to private health plans. For example, Tennessee law provides that neither a health insurance company nor a PBM may \"charge a pharmacist or a pharmacy a fee related to a claim unless it is apparent at the time of claim processing and is reported on the remittance advice of an adjudicated claim.\"296 Likewise, Indiana law explicitly regulates the practice of \"effective rate of reimbursement,\" and provides that a PBM may n ot \"[r]educe, directly or indirectly, payment to a pharmacy for pharmacist services to an effective rate of reimbursement...\"297 Finally, Effective Rate reconciliations may impinge on the multitude of \" Prompt Payment \" laws that exist in virtually every state in the country. For example, Mississippi 's Pharmacy Benefit Prompt Pay Act requir es PBMs to pay electronically submitted claims in full within fifteen days .298 PBMs' later -in-time retraction of the amounts paid could v iolate those requirements. 13.3 What Can Be Done? Effective Rate reimbursement requires a response at many levels: Legislativ e o State s should enact laws, like Tennessee's299 and Indiana's300 that prohibit recoupment of fees on claims that were not reflected at the point -of-sale or otherwise ban Effective Rate reimbursement as a construct altogether. o States should enact MAC Appeal Laws (where none exist) or amend existing MAC laws to prohibit health insurers and PBMs from circumventing MAC appeal rights through Effective Rate reimbursement constructs. o Laws should be enacted , like New Jersey's Fair Price law301, requiring PBM pricing transparency and prohibiting below -cost reimbursement to phar macies. 294 See e.g., New York Cancer & Blood Specialists, \"PBM Delays for Cancer Drugs May Risk Lives, Warn Oncologist,\" March 13 1860D -15, 42 Code. \u00a7 27 -1-24.5 See, Miss. Code Ann . \u00a7 73 -21-155 299 T. C. A. \u00a7 56 \u00a7 27 -1-24.5 -19(b)(4) 301 N.J.S.A. 17b:27f -1 to -10 Page 149 of 367 February 2022 80 Regulatory o CMS should audit Part D plan sponsors and contracted PBMs to determine whether GER/BER is appropriately reported and reconciled to CMS at the end of each Plan Year . o State Departments of Insurance should pursue complaints against PBMs and health insurers for violations of Any Willing Provider Laws, stemming from efforts to constructively deny providers the right to participate in pharmacy networks based on unreasonably low, below cost reimbursement rates. Plan Sponsor Action o As part of the PBM contract, plan sponsors should require PBMs to pass through any and all amounts PBMs received from the pharmacies after the point -of-sale on a claim -by-claim level . o As part of the PBM contract, plan sponsors should require PBMs to seek a permission prior to implementing a contracted -rate with the pharmacies (e.g., GER). 14 Conclusion The list of PBM abuses and games is seemingly never -ending and evolving . But the reality is that we are only just scratc hing the surface of understanding what these abusive health care middlemen are doing . Simply put, PBMs have overwhelmingly abused their responsibility to protect Americans from this country's drug pricing crisis, instead exploiting the opacity throughout the drug supply chain to enrich themselves. Their many abuses go well beyond just questionable rebate practices, and hurt patients and plan sponsors (including employers, Medicare, and Medicaid). Unfortunately, their impact is only becoming more pronounced , especially in oncology . More and more cancer drugs are coming out in oral formulations, further shifting care away from the medical space and into the pharmacy space. These expensive therapies are very attractive to PBM's because of the potential for h igh prices that yield high rebate revenues, high DIR fees, and eventually, high spreads - all of which are a function of the drug's cost. And even outside of the pharmacy benefits realm, through vertical integration, PBMs have been able to exert consider ably more influence in the other areas, such as injectable biosimilars and intravenous chemotherapies. Not only can PBMs can leverage these for steep originator and rebates (thereby stifling the biosimilar industry for their own gain), but PBMs have insti tuted mandatory white bagging policies to take even in -office administration out of the hands of community oncology practice s. The bottom line is this: today's drug supply chain is designed for cancer patients to receive inferior treatment, while paying mo re out -of-pocket. The time for action to stop PBM abuses is now. Each day that goes by, community oncology patients, practice s, and professionals become increasingly powerless because of horizonal PBM consolidation and vertical integration with insurers. Fortunately, however, solutions do exist. These include legislative efforts at both the state and federal levels. Many states' existing laws serve as prime examples of how they can be successfully implemented to protect the interests of patient s and health care payers (like employers, Medicaid programs, and taxpayers). In addition, based on many laws that are currently on the books, regulators (both state and federal) have tremendous tools available to them, that up until this point, have not b een widely utilized. Page 150 of 367 February 2022 81 The time is critical that regulators - including CMS, OCR, the FTC, state Boards of Pharmacy and state Departments of Insurance - take much need action to rein in the unchecked power of PBMs. The time for sitting back and letting mark et forces address the issues is over. The time for action to stop PBM abuses is now.

All 50 states have a PDMP, including Alaska. The Alaska Legislature established the PDMP, an electronic controlled substance prescription database , in 200 8 and it became operational in 2012 . Mandat es for prescribing practitioners and pharmacists to register, review prescriptions, and report using the PDMP database started in 2017. The PDMP is administered by the Board of Pharmacy under the Division of Corporations, Business and Professional Licensing (CBPL) , Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development (DCCED). DCCED contracted McKinley Research Group to independently and objectively explore the strengths and weakness of Alaska's PDMP, as well as capture recommendations for change at the statutory, regulatory, and process levels. These changes are necessary to keep up with the constantly evolving technology and policies supporting emergent best practices, data integration and compliance effectiveness . Determining the effectiveness of Alaska's PDMP is highly dependent upon numerous factors associated with Alaska's goals, supporting legislation, and program resources. These include the scope and breadth of use (i.e., mandated use, exemptions, compliance), implementation status and reach, ease of use and integration, data quality, data analysis and reporting capacities, and interagency data -sharing practices, among others. Next Step Recommendation It is recommended CBPL convene a PDMP working group to review the findings of this analysis and prioritize changes for improved effectiveness and impact through a multi -perspective lens. The nature of this optimization effort is beyond the scope or capacity of just the Board of Pharmacy itself and/or other healthcare licensure boards. Based on the Center s for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC ) framework for PDMP Use and Effective ness , it is recommended The Board of Pharmacy's overarching goals of Alaska's PDMP include: Monitoring and promoting judicious prescribing and dispensing practices Reducing inappropriate prescribing Identifying and preventing instances of misuse, abuse, and drug diversion Increas ing provider communication across provider settings Page 157 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 2 that the working group be comprised of representatives from the PDMP program , state health department (i.e., Chief Medical Officer ), state insurance programs (i.e., Medicaid Medical Director) , healthcare licensure boards , and law enforcement . Source: CDC The working group can establish its own goals and objectives; however, this report offers se veral considerations for improvement. These considerations are based on a review of Alaska's PDMP current practices, a policy and process analysis of other state experiences and perf ormance s, and Alaska stakeholder perspectives . While the analysis provides more considerations for improvement, below are considerations that may require higher priority . Considerations for Improvement Governance Evaluate the benefits and costs associated with shifting governance of the PDMP from the Board of Pharm acy to the Department of Health ( DOH ). This shift would allow the PDMP to better meet its overarching goals of preventing drug misuse and diversion by improving data sharing with other public health datasets and enabl ing DOH analysts to identify trends and practices that can then be addressed by department policy leaders. Additionally, this transfer would streamline the use of f ederal dollars channeled through federal agencies to support PDMP enhancements , facilitate better interoperability across state lines , and maximize federal grant spending . Page 158 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 3 Management Capacity Allocate a consistent level of appropriated state funding to support capacity and flexibility to implement program improvements, such as data infrastructure and data sharing ; these improvements may not be possible under restricted use of federal grants . Address the Division of Legislative Audit 2021 recommendation to alloca te sufficient resources for licensing examiner and investigator resources to ensure PDMP requirements are enforced.1 Increase PDMP staff to include a data analyst who can query the PDMP database and analyze output and outcome data to inform compliance and enforcement, evaluate controlled substance monitoring effectiveness, and advise policy decisions. Mandated Use and Exemptions Continue mandated PDMP use by all prescribing practitioners and pharmacists. Removing prescribing practitioners from mandated reporting will erode efforts to meet the PMDP 's goals to improve population health. Implement best practices , as established by the PDMP Training and Technical Assistance Center , to better position and address the burden on veterinarians, enabl ing full participation in the PDMP to meet its public health goals ; best practices would include enhanced software compatibility and more educational outreach. Assess all outpatient setting exemptions that undermine prescribing practices and may potentially lead to overdoses and drug diversion, but also to better evaluate the outcomes of Alaska's PDMP with more complete and accurate data. Delegates Improve awareness of how many delegates can be assigned to license holders and delegates' defined role and responsibilities. Ensure the capacity for prescribers and dispensers to audit their delegate use. Consider legislative changes that would allow non-licensed certified medical assistants (CMAs) or dental assistants access the PDMP as delegates of prescribing practitioners. 1 Alaska State Legislature, Division of Legislative Audit. \" A Sunset Review of the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development (DCCED ),\" July 15, 2021. Page 159 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 4 Voluntary Users Seek additional funding to further develop relationships with federal agencies and participation in Alaska's PDMP and maximize compatibility of federal prescriber systems to Alaska PDMP. Compliance Impacts Identify clear priorities for PDPM investigations , focusing on the program's intent to reduce overprescribing and overdoses, especially during the current backlog of investigations. Hold licensing boards accountable to address compliance issues of their licensees and develop \"standards of safe practice\" (if they have no t already done so ). Data Sharing Seek funding to enhance data infrastructure for effective data sharing. Examine the type, frequency, and form of data sharing with other practice boards and other public entities (i.e., Department of Corrections, Department of Public Safety, DOH ) to improve compliance and best practices. Establish a framework for data integration and data sharing between state departments (i.e., DOH , Department of Corrections, Department of Publi c Safety). Allow and set guidelines for interstate health information exchanges so state entities can share data under specific conditions. Establish criteria for expanding or reducing the number of interstate data sharing agreements. Integration Manage and communicate expectations of anticipated levels of statewide integration (PDMP /Heath information Exchange /Electronic Health Records ) implementation, particularly related to small practice settings and regions with poor broadband connectivity. Seek sustainable funding (including general funds or grant funding) for integration past FFY2024. With increased integration, reevaluate PDMP capacity needs to manage compliance, investigations, and data analysis.

The 2020 National Drug Strategy states that expanding the use of PDMPs is a fundamental element of the nation's effort to reduce drug overdose deaths .4 At present, all 50 states and four territories ( Puerto Rico, District of Columbia, Northern Mariana Islands , and Guam) have a PDMP. Alaska's PDMP was enacted through state legi slation in 2008 and became operational in 2012, requiring prescribing practitioners and pharmacists to register, review prescriptions , and report using the PDMP database in 2017. The PDMP is adminis tered by the Board of Pharmacy (the board) under the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development (the department or DCCED), Division of Corporations, Business and Professional Licensing (the division or CBPL). Purpose In June 2022, the State of Alaska issued an Informal Request for Propos als to conduct an Independent A nalysis of the Alaska P rescription Drug Monitoring Program . The described intent of the analysis was to explore the strengths and weakness of the current program, as well as capture recommendations for change at the statutory, regulatory, and process levels . McKinley Research Group (formerly McDowell Group), an Alaska -based research and consulting firm , was engaged to conduct this analysis , which began in July and extended through November 2022. 2 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), prescription drug misuse is when an individual uses a prescription drug in any way not directed by the prescriber. This includes using a prescription drug that was prescribed to another person (known as \"diversion\") or using it in an amount, frequency, duration, or any other w ay not directed by the prescriber. 3 Alaska Opioid Data Dashboard, Alaska Department of Health, Division of Public Health, last modified September 21, 2022. https://health.alaska.gov/dph/Director/Pages/opioids/ dashboard.aspx .

Page 162 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 7 Methodology McKinley Research Group used a mixed -methods approach , includ ing collecting and analyzing primary and secondary data. The approach included a technical work session, Alaska PDMP data compilation and an alysis, policy an alysis , literature review, and stakeholder interviews . Where the policy and best practices review was supported by stakeholder perspectives, the study team prioritized the issue as an area for consideration . Technical Work Session Early in the research process, we convened a small group of PDMP policy and program leaders positioned to provide ready access to data and other documentation, recommend key stakeholders to interview, and discuss potential analytical issues. The 1.5-hour work session (held virtually ) provided a contextual and technical grounding for the analysis with focused discussion on the PDMP 's legis lative and operational history, perceived challenges with current legislative and regulatory mandates, know n shifts in expectations , perceived value, and intent of the PDMP , current PDMP capacity and consistency across health systems , and program sustainability . Alaska PDMP Data Compilat ion and Analysis PDMP reports submitted to the Alaska State Legislature, summary program data, and other data queried from the PDMP program, as available , were reviewed. This process informed the interview process and recommendations for policy and process improvements. Policy An alysis and Literature Review Critical to the analysis was a review of Alaska's current statutes and regulations pertaining to the PDMP and legislative reports and data. Additionally, McKinley Research Group conducted a peer -reviewed and white paper literature review of other state s' and national PDMP polic ies, assessments, and outcomes . The review focused on best practices in PDMP legislation, regulation, policy, funding, staffing, data infrastructure , process systems, and eme rging trends in PDMP expanded u ses. Stakeholder Perspectives McKinley Research Group interviewed almost 50 professionals who work with the PDMP to better understand the program's effectiveness. Interviews were conducted by phone and video conference in September and October 2022. Stakeholders included various prescribing practitioners and pharmacists , drug misuse professionals, administrators, industry association leaders, investigators, licensing board members, and PDMP experts in other states. Stakeholders were asked about the PDMP's successes, challenges, clarity of legislation and regulations, system of governance, and ways to improve the program. (A list of stakeholders interviewed is found in Appendix A. ) Page 163 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 8 Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs Historical Context PDMPs are designed to facilitate the collection, analysis, and reporting of information on the prescribing, dispensing, and use of controlled substance s within a state. Ris ing goal s of PDMPs are to uphold state laws ensuring access to appropriate pharmaceutical care , deterring diversion of controlled subst ances , and u sing PDMP data to inform multi -sector population health and safety initiatives . PDMPs are not a new concept. The earliest PDMP was established by New York State in 1918 to address concerns about the prescribing of drugs , such as heroin and cocaine ; the law was rescinded three years later. The oldest continuously operated PDMP in the U.S. is in California , established in 1939 . In the 1970s, Pennsylvania, New York, and Rhode Island added PDMPs , followed by Texas and Michiga n in the 1980s . These PDMPs all had the same characteristics: Were tools for the enforcement of drug laws . Collect ed prescription information only on Schedule II controlled substances . Required multi -copy state -issued prescription forms to prescribe and di spense Schedule II medications . Required sending prescription information to the state within 30 days from the time the drug was dispensed .5 With electronic database and transmission technology emerging, 17 PDMPs were operational by 2000. In 2003, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) , through its Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) made federal gran t funding available to states interested in est ablishing , implementing, and enhancing PDMP s. Initial r esearch into the effectiveness of PDMP s showed they were a valuable tool for providing patient safety and identifying patients at risk for drug overdoses. By 2010, 27 more PDMPs were established (now totaling 44), with each state building on the experience and knowledge o f earlier programs. The State of Alaska was no exception, with foundational legislation passed in 2008 and an operational PDMP in place by 2012. By 2022, all 50 states and four territor ies (Puerto Rico, District of Columbia, Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam ) had a PDMP. 5 PDMP TTAC . \"Technical Assistance Guide: History of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs ,\" March 2018. https://www.pdmpassist.org/pdf/PDMP_admin/TAG_History_PDMPs_final_20180314.pdf .

Page 164 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 9 Evolution of PDMPs The earliest PDMPs were established primarily as enforcement and regulatory tools providing data to officials responsible for enforcing drug laws and overseeing the prescribing and dispensing of drugs. Consequently, state PDMP la ws most frequently include d law enforcement and regulatory goals, including reducing misuse and prescription drug diversion and aiding investigations. These types of legislative goals were much more common than health- focused goals , such as using the data to refer patients to treatment, reduce overdose s, or achieve public health goals. While this enforcement and regulatory role continues to be part of almost all current PDMPs, the focus of PDMPs is shifting to enhance patient care , assist in developing drug abuse prevention and treatment strategies , and inform state health policy development. In comparison to the early years of PDMPs, current -day PDMPs have become an important tool to address the drug abuse epidemic and inform public health an d safety approaches. States are continuously improving their programs to be more responsive to stakeholders with more timely and accurate information. All PDMPs allow access to their data by prescribing practitioners and pharmacists . Some PDMPs are no w allowing access to data by nontraditional stakeholders, such as drug courts, medical examiners, and drug treatment programs. For example, Wisconsin and Utah collect data on individuals who have overdosed or been found guilty of drug vio lation s and report this information to practitioners querying the PDMP. As recently as August 2020, revised 42 CFR Part 2 federal regulations went into effect , permit ting certain federally assisted substance use disorder (SUD) treatment program s to report protected records (e.g., SUD medication prescribed or dispensed) to the applicable PDMP if required by state law and if the patient consents.6 In response, some states are making PDMP legislative adjustment s to reflect this change for enhanced he alth- focused u ses. Other improvements include interstate data sharing (now available in 47 states) and integration of PDMP data with health information exchanges (HIEs), electronic health records (EHRs), and pharmacy dispensing systems (PDS). 7 Some ex amples of successful legislative changes to PDMPs and improved outcomes includ e: 6 PDMP TTAC. \"42 CFR Part Asked May 2021. https://www.pdmpassist.org/pdf/TTAC_42_CFR_Part_2_FAQs_final_20210528.pdf \"Technical Assistance Guide: History Drug Monitoring Programs ,\" March 2018. https://www.pdmpassist.org/pdf/PDMP_admin/TAG_History_PDMPs_final_ 20180314.pdf .

Page 165 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 10 In 2010, Florida stopped health care providers from dispensing prescription opioid pain relievers from their offices and establish ed a PDMP. By 2012, Florida experienced a 50% decrease in oxycodone overdose deaths.8 In 2012, New York required prescribers to check the state's PDMP before prescribing opioids. By 2013, New York experienced a 75% drop in patients' seeing multiple prescribers for the same drugs (also referred to as \"drug seeking\").9 In 2012, Tennessee required p rescribers to check the state's PDMP before prescribing painkillers. By 2013, Tennessee experienced a 36% decline in patients' seeing multiple prescribers for the same drugs.10 After creation of its PDMP, Pennsylvania experienced a 22% decrease in the ov erall quantity of opioid pills prescribed , a 9% decrease in partially filled prescriptions, and an 18% decrease in authorized refills between 2017 and 2020. Opioid prescriptions for greater than seven days of supply decreased by a larger amount than prescr iptions for less than seven days of supply (43% vs . 27%). Similarly, prescriptions for more than 22 pills decrease d more than prescriptions for less than 21 days (37% vs. 21%).11 Effectiveness of PDMPs Determining state -level effectiveness of a PDMP is highly dependent upon numerous factors associated with each state's goals, supporting legislation , and program resources. These include the scope and breadth of use (i.e., mandated use, exemptions, compliance ), implementation status and reach, ease of u se and integration, data quality, data analysis and reporting capacities, and interagency data- sharing practices , among others. However , evaluations of PDMPs in general have illustrated effective changes in prescribing behaviors, patients' use of multiple providers, and decreased substance abuse treatment admissions. PDMPs play an effective role in combating fraudulent prescription of drugs, monitor ing controlled substance abuse, and reduc ing the e rroneous prescription among practitioners . Prescribing practitioners and pharmacists are increasingly using available PDMP data as a patient education and clinical decision -making tool during a patient encounter . PDMP manager s struggled for many years to expand the use of their data by prescrib ing practitioners and pharmacists. Mandatory registration and queries and one -click access have caused the use 8 Johnson, Hall et al. \"Decline in Drug Overdose Deaths After State Policy Changes - Florida 2010- 2012\", Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014): 569- 574. https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6326a3.htm.

More than half the states require prescribing practitioners and dispensers to check the PDMP data before prescribing or dispensing controlled substances, including opioids. Evidence indicates that mandated use is an effective tool to reduce the number of controlled substances dispensed, including opioids, benzodiazepines , and amphetamine s.12 Research on PDMP's strengths concluded that the development of PDMP, supported by evolving state legislation and integrated data sharing, play s a crucial role in improving health outcomes and safety, identifying potential prescribing concerns, informing public health programs and policies, and driving third -party payer cost savings. PDMP implementation has mitigated opioid misuse and helped to reduce drug -poisoning death s.13 PDMPs h ave been shown t o reduce incidences of doctor (or other prescribing practitioners, such as dentists or veterinarians ) shopping. In addition, PDMP s play a role in increased transparency in reporting prescription drugs, especially controlled substances.14 Some states pro actively analyze the prescription data in search of patients, physicians, or pharmacies who exhibit an unusual order, use, or patterns for dispensing , which helps in the investigation of possible diversion or abuse .15 States , such as Maryland, Georgia, and Alabama, have effectively u sed aggregate PDMP data and other data sets to bolster public health policy and implement appropriate interventions among areas of targeted concern (i.e., critical differences in prescribing practi ces within the state, overdose rates with people receiving both opioids and benzodiazepines , nonfatal over dose s, and overdose fatality reviews ).16 Through its analysis of Medicaid prescription and hospital utilization data, Kentucky was able to reduc e the opioid prescription s, and opioid - related inpatient stay and emergency department rates, thereby resulting in significant savings in Medicaid spending .17 12 Manders L ., and Abd -Elsayed A. \"Mandatory Review of Prescription Drug Monitoring Program Before Issuance of a Controlled Substance R esults in Overall Reduction of Prescriptions Including Opioids and Benzodiazepines .\" Pain Physician (June 23, 2020):299- 304. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32517396/ .

Page 168 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 13 Alaska's PDMP Goals The Role of Alaska's PDMP In 2008, the Alaska Legislature passed Senate Bill (SB) 196 , requiring the Board of Pharmacy to establish the Alaska PDMP - a federally funded electronic controlled substance prescription database . From 20 09 to 2011, the State obtained startup federal grant funding and adopted PDM P regulations. On Januar y 1, 2012, the Alaska PDMP became available for statewide use to licensees who registered. In response to the evolving opioi d ep idemic, the Alaska Opioid Policy Task Force, housed within the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services (now Department of Health [ DOH]) , conducted several community meetings to discuss potential opioid prescription guidelines and p rovide recommendations to the governor and Legislature in November 2016. In 2017 , mandatory registering, reviewing, and reporting with the PDMP database were enacted under AS 17.30.200 for prescribing practitioners and pharmacists. (Statutes and administrative codes relevant to Alaska PDMP can be found in Appendix B ). Bamboo Health, formerly Appriss Health , is the department's vendor, which provides the prescription drug monitoring interface, AWARxE. The program is designed to improve patient care and to encourage cooperation and coordination among state, local, and federal agencies and other states to redu ce the misuse, abuse, and diversion of Schedule II-IV controlled substances (hereon to be referred to as \"controlled substances\"). (A list of these controlled substances can be found in Appendix C .) The program's stated overarching goals include: Monitoring and promoting judicious prescribing and dispensing practices. Reducing inappropriate prescribing . Identifying and preventing instances of misuse, abuse, and drug diversion. Increasing provider communication across provider settings.19 19 Alaska Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development. \"Alaska Prescription Drug Monitoring Program Report to the 32nd Alaska State Legislature (2022 ).\" https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/ web/portals/5/pub/PHA_PDMP_2022_LegislativeReport.pdf . (Accessed October 19, 2022.) Page 169 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 14 Stakeholder Perspectives of the Role of Alaska's PDMP Almost all stakeholders understood the PDMP's intent and goals, and about 90% of stakeholders reported they believe these goals are being met. Medical providers frequently described the PDMP as a n effective tool that helps them do a better job prescribing. Most in -state stakehol ders (about 83%) believe the PDMP is a major factor in the decline of prescription drug misuse. \" It's muc h more difficult for patients to hide that they're receiving multiple prescriptions. It's keeping people honest,\" one interviewee said. Even among stakeholders who believe the PDMP is meeting goals, some said gaps in compliance remain due to inconsistent reporting and regulatory exemptions that allow opioids to still be easily obtained, such as the exemption to review the PDMP if prescribing within 48 hours of a procedure . Most stakeholders who think the PDMP is not meeting its goals identified two main perceptions of failure to meet the program's intent: 1) investigations focus too much on technical compliance infractions instead of major prescribing violations that could lead to drug misuse and overdose , and 2) PDMP data are not being used sufficiently to address public health concerns. \"My mother was addicted. No one thought an 86 -year -old lady was a drug seeker. People didn't check the PDMP and see what her use was. That, ultimately, is what the PDMP is for.\" \"Part of the problem is that the data are locked down in such a deep dark lockbox. Public health can't get access to the data.\" \"The q uestion for the L egislature is what's the purpose of the PDMP. Is it j ust to stop opioid use, o r is it to punish doctors ? A lot of our licensees wonder that. \" Page 170 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 15 Evaluation of Alaska's PDMP Components This section describes the current construct of Alaska's PDMP , including governance, management capacity , mandated use and exemptions, delegates, voluntary users, patient matching, compliance impacts, data sharing, and integration . Stakeholders offered suggestions for each comp onent, such as how to improve compliance, enhance ease of use, and better meet program goals. Policy r esearch guide s recommendations for alternative statutory, regulatory, and process considerations for each component . Governance Current Construct Under Alaska Statu te (AS) 17.30 .200, the Alaska PDMP is housed under the Alaska Board of Pharmacy within the Division of Corporations, Business and Professional Licensing , DCCED . Under AS 08.80.030, the Board of Pharmacy was g ranted the powers necessary to establish and maintain a controlled substance prescription database as provided in AS 17.30.200. Bamboo Health is the State's current vendor providing prescription drug monitoring database services. The term PDMP may be used interc hangeably with AWARxE, the prescription drug monitoring interface, as both terms refer to the database. Policy and P rocess Review According to the PDMP Training and Technical Assistance Center, currently 17 of the 54 PDMPs across the nation are housed in a Board of Pharmacy (including Alaska), 17 in a state health department, and the rest are in consumer or professional licensing agencies. The advantage of housing a PDMP in a Board of Pharmacy is the ready access to pharmacy practices. However, the advantag e to housing in a health department is the linkages with other databases and data analysis expertise, such as vital statistics, medical examiners, and other population health data sets. Use of PDMPs as a public health tool has grown with the increase in p rescription opioid overdoses, improvements in health IT, and an understanding that a robust public health response is necessary to address the opioid overdose epidemic. Health department staff are highly skilled in using data to address public health problems (for example, mandatory reporting of infectious diseases allows health departments to investigate reported cases, connect affected individuals with appropriate treatment, and implement focused preventive measures). Page 171 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 16 Increasing access to PDMP data can enable health departments to respond to and reduce opioid -related harms more effectively, coordinating with other agencies to ensure that patients are directed to appropriate clinicians when their prescribing practitioner stops prescribing opioids . Health de partments also can link PDMP data with other datasets to improve surveillance, prevention, and response. 20 The ease of sharing data with other public health data sets (i.e., Medicaid, vital statistics, medical examiners) is demonstrated in the figure be low. While PDMP data can be assessed by public health officials outside of the state health department, the pathways are more streamlined if the PDMP is housed within a state health department. Figure 2. Considerations for Accessing and Using PDMP Data Based on PDMP Location Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Additionally, when housed in the Board of Pharmacy, the Board of Pharmacy has increased compliance and data management responsibility to report to other practice boards . Yet, the Board of Pharmacy has no authority to make other board licensees compliant. (For more details on compliance, see Compliance Impacts section.) 20 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"Leveraging Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) Data in Page 172 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 17 Stakeholder Perspectives Stakeholders were divided as to whether the PDMP is effectively positioned under DCCED and the Board of Pharmacy. Most prescribers and dispensers interviewed said current DCCED oversight of the PDMP is working. However, public health officials, drug misuse specialists, and administrators more frequently advocated moving the PDMP to the DOH . Their reasons include: The PDMP's goals are better aligned with DOH 's missi on to protect public health. DOH could use PDMP data to offer prescribers more current information on opioid use, dangerous trends, pain management, and other issues. The Board of Pharmacy and other boards have limited ability to share PDMP data. L icensing boards are composed of volunteers , which limits their capacity in dealing with the PDMP and noncompliance. Some stakeholders expressed a sense that the Board of Pharmacy had been encumbered with a large responsibility overseeing the PDMP, without having the authority to enforce compliance. Creating a PDMP board outside the Board of Pharmacy and with members from various practice professions could provide more joint decision -making and oversight. Some noted that even if the PDMP is moved to the DO H, licenses could still be used for enforcement, with a memorandum of agreement (MOU) established between departments so violations still affect practice licenses. Stakeholders from other states noted moving the PDMP to another department sometimes creates difficulties. Disadvantages to moving the program include: Access to data - DOH in other states sometimes have been reluctant to share data with law enforcement and others outside of the department. Loss of data or interruption of data continuity - This may be caused by the transfer of data systems or a change in vendors. Cultural shifts - Departmental culture can impact approaches to compliance and enforcement. Considerations for Improvement Evaluate the benefits and costs associated with shifting governan ce of the PDMP to DOH . This shift would allow for better data sharing with other public health datasets , provide better access to data analysts equipped to analyze and interpret the data, and \"I've a lways been very confused why is the PDMP not within state prevention work since it's a prevention tool. \" \"Just because it isn't housed there (in the Department of Commerce), doesn't mean it shouldn't have the teeth with licensing.\" \"They should separate the PDMP from Pharmacy partly because providers feel the Board of Pharmacy is policing their profession.\" Page 173 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 18 evaluate the effectiveness of the PDMP to meet its goals of identifying and preventing instances of misuse, abuse, and drug diversion. Transferring management to the DOH would streamline the use of f ederal dollars channeled through federal agencies to support PDMP enhancements and facilitate better interoperability ac ross State lines. Any shift would require new legislation and regulations. It also would require a transfer of vendor management and staffing to ensure a smooth transition without loss of data and expertise. Regardless of where the PDMP is housed, further detailed examination of the type, frequency, and form of data sharing with other practice boards and other public entities (i.e., Department of Correction s, Department of Public Safety, DOH ) needs to be addressed to improve compliance and best practices . (See \" Data Sharing \" section below.) Management Capacity Current Construct FUNDING The c urrent annual operat ing budget for the Alaska PDMP is a bout $1 million. Federal and state grant funding p ays for database vend or costs and all program staff . As the CBPL which includes the Alaska Board of Pharmacy does not have federal receipt authority, grant funding for the PDMP must be obtained through DOH , which has receipt authority. The DOH ultimately determines whether to pursue available PDMP funding opportunities. In the event DOH elects to proceed, the PDMP program manager writes the grant proposal(s). A n overview of c urrent funding is de scribed below . Table 1. Current Alaska PDMP Funding Funding Source Total Amount per Year Funding Cycle Ends Length of Funding Cycle DOH - Bureau of Justicea $337,000 September 2023 3 years DOH -Division of Behavioral Health Statewide Opioid Response $260,000 September 2 years DOH - CDC Overdose to Actionb $275,000-$300,000 September 2023 5 years DOH - CDC - Statewide Gateway $200,000 September 2023 - Note s: a18% of the total $1.3 million BJA funding award goes to DOH to cover indirect costs as per federally approved negotiated rate. b Funding fluctuates per year based on availability of additional unused funds.

The position is intended to assist in the creation of a sustainable plan to monitor compliance u sing vendor tools and analytics , provid ing education and outreach to dispensers, and assist ing users with troubleshooting. PDMP I nvestigator - focuses on compliance and investigates issues of potential concern. Policy and Process Review FUNDING When the Alaska PDMP was established, the intent was that the program would be funded through federal grants and state appropriations (AS 08.01.065). With the rising demands to address the opioid crisis, costs rose to implement the PDMP. Federal funding di d not seem sufficient , so in 2018, the Division was granted regulatory authority to institute a $25 per biennium user fee to help offset administrative costs. However, fee collection was burdensome and inefficient. The Division then initiated a regulation change (12 AAC 02.107) to reduce the fee to $0. A combination of federal and state grants currently fund s the program , with no fiscal support through state appropriation. Program trajectory and priorities are dictated by grant availability and conditions, including evolving terms of agreement that some states are increasingly unwilling to accept. This results in ongoing funding uncertainty for a state- legislated mandate. As potential uses of PDMP expansion emerge, multiple financial factors handicap the p rogram's capacity to implement useful enhancements to PDMP's electronic database (i.e., integrated overdose data, a special module for opioid treatment programs to report per 42 CFR Part 2, expanded data analytics and reporting) . These financial factors include lack of DCCED's direct receipt authority, funding uncertainties, and static funding levels within multi -year funding cycles. It is worth noting that some mandated users who oppose the Alaska PDMP recognize the ongoing fiscal uncertainty and are \"holding out\" to decide how compliant they will be. The PDMP is an unfunded mandate (not aligned with legislative intent) and efforts for sustainable funding through licensee fees has not been successful, which is arguably not appropriate for a public health outcome. Additionally, federal grants received do not necessarily support evolving Page 175 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 20 program needs, leaving a lack of funding for data sharing or other initiatives to improve PMDP outcomes. STAFFING Across the country, t he majority of PDMPs (35) operate with a staff of five FTEs o r fewer. Program staff sizes range from 1 to 31 individuals functioning in a variety of capacities. On average, PDMPs have about 6.87 total employees with approximately 3.6 in operations, 1.0 in technical, 1.5 in analytical, and 0.8 in other job classifications.21 In a 2021 legislative audit, the Alaska State Legislature recognized staffing is insufficient for investigation.22 An investigator position was subsequently added, although investigators for the licensing boards also conduct PDMP investigati ons as part of their board's investigatory process. The current staffing model for the Alaska PDMP reflects an emphasis on investigation and compliance . While these functions are necessary, the program's overall effectiveness in impacting and informing statewide public health and safety efforts (i.e., policies, programs, and initiatives ) is currently limited. Stakeholder Perspectives Stakeholders consistently reported the PDMP staff has been very responsive in answering questions and providing needed resources, such as data and training. The PDMP manager received high ratings for communication, responsiveness, and active participation in board and other meetings. The PDMP staff was praised for tapping funding from multiple sources, maximizing federal funding, and minimizing user fees. Despite giving the PDMP staff high marks, some stakeholders said they thought staffing levels are inadequate to deal with workloads and several noted Alaska's PDMP staff is smaller than its counterparts in other states. Some stakeholders particularly reported a need for more investigators, both within the PDMP sta ff and with the licensing boards . Although an investigator 21 Bureau of Justice Assistance, U.S. Department of Justice. \" PDMP Policies and C apabilities: Results From 2021 State Assessment.\" https://www.pdmpassist.org/pdf/PDMP%20Policies%20and%20Capabilities%202021%20Assessment% 20Results_20210921.pdf .

Considerations for Improvement FUNDING Alaska State Legislature shoul d consider a consistent level of appropriated funding to support state initiatives for program improvements and flexibilities , such as data infrastructure , data sharing and analysis , and EHR statewide integration . Due to restrict ed use of federal grant funding, state appropriations can provide the capacity to maximize the PDMP's effectiveness. If the PDMP program continues to be housed within CBPL , consider approval of federal receipts authority to maximize the Division 's federal grant dollars (rather than a percentage of overhead being retained by DOH ). STAFFING Regardless of whether the PDMP remains in the Board of Pharmacy or moves to the DOH , a data analyst who can query the database and analyze output and outcome data would offer considerably more information to inform compliance and enforcement, evaluat e controlled substance monitoring effectiveness , and inform policy decisions . Mandated Use and Exemptions Current Construct MANDATED USE Under Alaska Statute (AS) 17.30.200, t here is required PDMP registration and use for prescrib ing practitioners and pharmacists , along with a compliance process for mandatory revie w and reporting . Required users who are actively licensed to practice in Alaska include: Dentists, opto metrists, physicians, and veterinarians who hold a DEA registration. Nurse practitioners who hold a DEA registration and state -level controlled substance prescriptive authority issued by the Alaska Board of Nursing . Physician Assistants who hold a DEA reg istration and an active collaborative practice agreement with prescribing physicians . Pharmacists who live and dispense controlled substances in Alaska . Pharmacies that dispense controlled substances in Alaska. According to the PDMP's Report to the Alaska State Legislature (May 2022), total registered users in the PDMP is 9,527, a growth of 416% from the 1,847 users in 2017. Page 177 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 22 EXEMPTIONS AS 17.30.200 also details exemptions for conducting a review of patient medical history and/or reporting prescription data in specific setting and situations.

However, if PDMP usage is not mandatory, not all prescribing practitioners are willing to go the extra mile and check the drug's overuse among their patients. 25 Prescriber- use mandates can rapidly increase PDMP utilization, which can have an immediate impact on prescriber behavior, helping to reduce inappropriate pres cribing of opioids and benzodiazepines and also multiple -provider episodes (when patients visit numerous prescribers and/or pharmacies to obtain the same or similar drugs in a short time 23 Alaska Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development. \"Prescription Drug Monitoring Program Use & Exemptions.\" https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/cbpl/ProfessionalLicensing/PrescriptionDrugMonitoring Program/UseExemptions.aspx.

For example , based on a survey of South Dakota licensed veterinarians who prescribe opioids in late 2018 and early 2019, veterinarians are largely aware of the increasing opioid problem, have modified their practices because of it, and are dedicated to finding a balance between treating their animal patients in the most effective way while also avoiding contributing to the opioid problem. Veterinarians are seeing an alarming trend of pet owners taking opioids intended for their pets to support their own addiction. 29 Additionally, about 14 states, including Alaska, do not have laws or regulations on mandatory reporting and immunity for inhumane treatment of animals. 30 In another study of Colorado veterinarians, 13% reported that they were aware of a person intentionally harming their pet, or making their pet seem harmed, to receive opioids for their own use. Further, 44% of veterinarians were aware of a veterinary staff member or client who abused or misused opioids. In this same study, 36% recommended improving the PDMP guidelines and tutorials to help improve access and utilization. The Colorado Consortium for Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention recommended devotion of time and resources to assess and interview on the issue of prescription opioid diversion in veterinary medicine for tracking and surveillance, requiring the same levels of compliance required of other prescribing practitioners for logging prescriptions of scheduled drugs into state PDMP systems. This should also include enhanced workplace policies, pract ices, procedures, training, and monitoring to mitigate the risks of diversion, misuse, and abuse by both clinic staff and clients. 31 26 The Pew Charitable Trusts . \"Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs: Evidence -based Burk, and Yan -Fang Ren. \"Impact of a mandatory prescription drug monitoring program on prescription of opioid analgesics by dentists.\" PLoS One 10, no. 8 (2015): e0135957. https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0135957.

(Accessed September 22, 179 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 24 Stakeholder Perspectives MANDATED USE Some stakeholders recognized that PDMPs were an underus ed and ineffective resource prior to mandatory use requirements. Others, including individuals responsible for informing statewide substance misuse initiatives , equated mandated PDMP use with comprehensive data collection on all opioid s prescribed or dispensed in Alaska. EXEMPTIONS A few stakeholders , including veterinarians, some dentists, and medical specialists, called for exemptions from PDMP requirements for their professions, saying the proportion of opioid prescriptions by practitioners in their field is so small as to be insignificant. However, o t her stakeholders argued that exemptions water down the intent of PDMP legislation to prevent drug misuse , diversion, and overdose s. One interviewee stated that if veterinarians are exempted from the PDMP, then dealing with prescription opioid abusers who target veterinarians falls back onto law enforcement. Veterinarians who were interviewed advocated for a P DMP exemption , arguing that because they treat animals and operate under a different set of conditions than prescribers for humans, the PDMP is not appropriate for them . Other reasons include the following: The number of controlled substances veterinarians prescribe is miniscule. From 2016 to 2018, veterinarians prescribed 0.3% of the opioids prescribed in Alaska, according to the Board of Pharmacy. Some veterinarians believe they are expected to be applying Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) rule s; however, the PDMP is not a HIPAA covered entity . While there may be options to allow for integration, v eterinarian s expressed their concerns their electronic reporting systems do not integrate with the PDMP easily . \"Because of mandated use, I thought the PDMP database had comprehensive data on all opioid prescriptions .\" \"Mandatory use was only enacted across the country because it wasn't being used.\" \"The d rawback in removing exemptions is t he political blowback. However, if the goal is to reduce overdose deaths , the exemptions are not helpful.\" \"Anything that can help law enforcement or prevent the problem is a good thing. [Veterinarians ] need to be part of the solution. They can't ignore the problem.\" \"Dentists are one example \u2014 they will prescribe to the exe mption, and they miss people who are drug seeking for criminal or fraudulent purposes.\" Page 180 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 25 Identifying a certain human associated with an animal can be challenging, especially when animals are brought in by shelters, house sitters, or m ultiple people. However, several stakeholders , including national PDMP experts and prescribers outside of veterinary medicine , stated that while they appreciate the differences between veterinarians and other practitioners, drug seekers have used pets to access medication . Removing veterinarians from mandated use would likely result in more drug seeking behavior impacting their practices . Also, veterinarians are increasingly prescribing drugs designed for humans (including muscle relaxants, antidepressants, anxiolytics, and opioids ) for animals. Considerations for Improvement Continue the mandated use by all prescribing practitioners and pharmacists. Removing prescribing practitioners from mandated reporting will erode efforts to meet the overarching goals of the PMDP itself and impr ove population health. Further assess all outpatient setting exemptions to not only improve prescribing practices, avoiding ov erdoses, and drug diversion, but also to better e valuat e the outcomes of Alaska's PDMP with more complete and a ccurate data. Given the current extent of the ex emptions , some program and data analys es are not currently possible. To better position and address the burden on veterinarians to fully participate in the PDMP and its public health goals, c onsider implementing the veterinarian best practices as established by the PDMP Training and Technical Assistance Center . Some of those best practices include: o Work with veterinary software vendors to update their software to incorporate the appropriate American Society for Autom ation in Pharmacy ( ASAP ) reporting format. Explore opportunities to incentivize the updates with federal (or state) grant funds. o Through educational outreach and improved access to published resources on the requirements for the PDMP , ensure the accurate capture of an animal owner's name, DOB, and gender and the ASAP format's species code. PDMPs may need to work with their PDMP vendors to ensure that veterinary medications are identified appropriately in the controlled -substance drug table and on PDMP reports. 32 32 PDMP TTAC. \"Veterinary Best Practices ,\" (Accessed September 20, 2022 .) \"For veterinarians, the patients may be animals, but the animal didn't make the appointment, fill the prescription, abuse the drug, or are criminals....while DEA may track inventory, they don't know what the vet sent out to the patient unless they do an audit, which typically are acted on when there is a complaint...but if the vet writes a prescription that gets reported to the PDMP, it closes the distribution circle.\" Page 181 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 26 Delegates Current Construct Delegates for the required users may access the PDMP only if licensed, registered, certified, or otherwise regulated by DCCED. That is, any professional who holds an active license under the DCCED's boards (as regulat ed under AS 08) can serve as a delegate. For example, the current legislation allows for a licensed hairdresser to be a delegate, but not a non- licensed medical assistant or dental assistant . Policy and Process Review A majority of PDMPs allow prescribers to authorize certain members of their health care teams to access the PDMP on their behalf. Such delegation is a widely adopted PDMP practice that supports, and potentially increases, prescriber use of the databases. 33 Health care staff with delegate accounts, also referred to as \"subaccounts,\" can save time for prescribers, thereby supporting PDMP use. Such process improvements can facilitate two important prescriber clinical practices: consistent use of PDMP reports for most or all patients prescribed controlled substances, and pre -visit planning to ensure that PDMP information is readily available to the prescriber during a patient's visit.34 According to a national study, prescribing practitioners had generally positive views about the value of delegates (often nurses or medical assistants ) using PDMPs. Some prescribing practitioners and pharmacists noted that the ability for delegates to access the PDMP was a significant time -saver for physicians in a busy practice. However, others expressed concern that allowing delegates to have access to the PDMP increased risks to patient privacy by increasing the number of people with access to sensitive patient information. 35 Some states, such as Alabama and Nevada limit the number of delegates per prescriber . Restricting subaccounts to licensed professionals may offer an additional layer of accountability, but at the expense of potentially lowering PDMP utilization. Some states hold prescribers accountable for their delegates' activity , including licensed and non- licensed delegates . For example, to assist prescriber oversight of delegates, Oregon and Maine allow prescribers to audit multiple delegates with a single query. This allows the prescriber to monitor for unauthorized use of the data. 33 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services . \"Report to Congress: State Challenges and Best Practices Implementing PDMP Requirements Under Section 5042 of the Support https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/data The Pew Charitable Trusts . \"Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs: Evidence -based 2016. https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research -drug -monitoring - programs November 2, 2022.) 35 Government Accountability Office. \"Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs: Views on Usefulness and Challenges of Programs ,\" October 2020. https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao -21-22.pdf . (Accessed November 15, 2022 .) Page 182 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 27 Stakeholder Perspectives Many providers called for expanding the number and/or type of delegates (licen sed and non- licensed ) authorized to check the PDMP because of prescribing practitioners' heavy workloads. Several stakeholders mentioned anecdotally that some prescribers may be giving nondelegates their access codes because they don't have another licensed professional who can help in accessing PDMP data. Increasing delegates was the second most frequently mentioned way to increase PDMP usability, following PDMP integration into EHRs. Prescribers' recommendation was to allow ancillary staff without licenses to handle PDMP checks, while the State continues to hold licensed providers responsible for delegates' actions. While f ull integration into an EHR would reduce or eliminate the need for delegates in many situations , full integration is not realistic in many smaller practices. Considerations for Improvement Improve awareness of how many delegates can be assigned to license holders and delegates' defined role and responsibilities and ensure the capacity for prescribers and dispensers to audit their delegate use . Consider legisla tive changes that would allow non- licensed certified medical assistants (CMAs) or dental assistants to access the PDMP as delegates of prescribing practitioners. Volunt ary Users Current Construct As stated in the Alaska PDMP's 2022 Legislative Report, 118 IHS pharmacists, 19 V eterans A ffairs (VA) pharmacists, and 13 military pharmacists are registered with Alaska's PDMP. IHS had 534 prescribing practitioners, 74 VA prescribing practitioners, and 75 military prescribing practitioners w ho have voluntarily registered with Alaska's PDMP. Since state laws and regulations governing access to these systems often apply only to prescribing practitioners licensed in the states in which the PDMP is located and many federal health care workers are not so licensed, many federal p rescribing practitioners are not subject to these requirements. However, federal pharmacies have policies in place for these requirements. \"We need more individuals to have access to PDMP on behalf of doctors. They need more delegates.\" Page 183 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 28 In 2016, IHS implemented a policy change requiring all federal IHS pharmacies to report opioi d prescribing information to state PDMPs.36 In 2019, IHS released to all IHS federal facilities PDMP software that automatically reports controlled substance prescriptions to state -based PDMPs in near -real time. According to IHS officials, all IHS facil ities now report information to their respective state PDMPs.37 Additionally IHS has been in preliminary planning and design discussions to evaluate the feasibility of PDMP interoperability into the IHS EHR and advocating for PDMP standardization to facilitate information sharing.38 The Defense Health Agency (DHA) has its own PDMP to monitor opioid prescriptions for its beneficiaries and does not require that prescribing practitioners or pharmacists participate in state PDMPs.39 In 2019, the Military Health System (MHS) entered an agreement with the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) to establish a connection with their Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) Interconnect System, which allows for the transfer of presc ription data across state lines. The MHS PDMP is the first nonstate or territory PDMP permitted to become a part of NABP's Interconnect System. 40 All Veterans Health Administration (V HA) pharmacies are required to participate in state PDMPs that are compatible with Veterans Affairs software. VHA pharmacies are required to enroll in the state program where the VA medical facility is geographically located and transmit data regarding Schedules II -V controlled substances daily . A separate VHA directive released in 2016 requires providers to query state PDMPs prior to initiating therapy with a controlled substance. Additionally, for each VHA patient, prescribing practitioners must query the state PDMPs at least once a year and document the results in the VA m edical record.41 Policy and Process Review Major federal agencies (such as the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) , Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (O NC), Office of National Drug Control Policy ( ONDCP ), VA, IHS) and others recognize the value of PDMPs and fully support their mission. Additionally, they have established policies and enacted laws and 36 According to Chapter 32 of the Indian Health Manual, all federal IHS pharmacy site s with an approved MOU between the IHS Area and the State in which the facility is located shall ensure that Schedule CII -CV dispensing data are reported at the frequency required by the State in which the facility is located. 37 Government Accountability Office. \"Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs: Views on Usefulness and Challenges of Programs ,\" October 2020. https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao -21-22.pdf .

While Alaska cannot mandate federal government agencies ' participation, particularly prescribing practitioners, there is growing recognition more integration between federal PDMPs and state PDMPs is needed for coordinated care of patients who access both federal and non - federal care systems, as well as to reduce the risk of opioid -related harm among these individuals. Stakeholder Perspectives Stakeholders observed Alaska has a large military, veteran , and IHS patient base that make these data part of Alaska PDMP \"absolutely essential\" because patients often receive care from military, VA or IHS prescribing practitioners as well as non -VA or IHS practitioners. This could lead to excessive prescriptions or potential harmful interactions between drugs. Amongst stakeholders, t here was not a uniformed awareness of the level the PDMP was integrated into the Military Health System , VA, or IHS system . Considerations for Improvement Seek additional funding to further develop relationships with federal agencies and participation in Alaska's PDMP and maximize compatibility of federal prescriber systems to Alaska PDMP. Patient Matching Current Construct Prescribing practitioners and pha rmacists find challenges matching PDMP records to the correct patient when searching the PDMP. Inaccurate patient matching can result in a PDMP search returning no records for a patient, returning records for the wrong patient, or returning multiple possible matches for a patient. These patient matching problems could happen due to clerical errors, patient name changes, patients having similar names and birthdates, or a patient using multiple names or having duplicate PDMP records. Such situations may resul t in a provider not having access to a patient's full medication history. Increased interstate data sharing often impacts the likelihood of patient matching difficulties. While proprietary algorithms may help alleviate these errors, their effectiveness has not been proven. Incorrect patient matching can lead to compl iance issues and increase the number of compliance investigations. Policy and Process Review Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology ( ONC ) officials stated that while the agency does not have authority over the operation of PDMPs, its broader efforts could Page 185 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 30 help address PDMP patient matching problems. In 2017 , ONC published the Patient Demographic Data Quality Framework, a tool to help providers and other organizations assess their processes for managing data quality and improve the quality of the demographic data they use in matching. In 2019, ONC hosted a symposium on patient matching for PDMPs that brought together stakeholders, such as PDMP administrators and health IT developers, to discuss patient matching challenges faced by PDMPs. In addition, ONC officials described how they are obtaining private -sector input on technical solutions for patient matching and are working with health IT standards development organiz ations to better support patient matching. These efforts have the potential to improve patient matching for PDMPs. 42 Stakeholder Perspectives Several prescribing practitioners noted their struggles in accuracy when entering a patient's name. In some instances, the PDMP convention requests first and then last name, compared to a more common filing process of last and then first name. Additionally , inaccurate spelling and name variations, commonly used by drug seekers, further complicate patient matching. Considerations for Improvement Review the naming convention to improve standardization with patient records. Compliance Impacts Current Construc t The Board of Pharmacy is required to ensure compliance with PDMP legislative mandates. However, the licensing boards are required to communicate with their licensees and enforce mandated use requirements stated within their respective chapters of AS 08. Li censing boards vary in the approaches to communic ate PDMP information to their licensees . Half of the b oards, including the State Medical Board , Board of Examiners in Optometry , and the Board of Veterinary Examiners , do not send out periodic notices to licensees. Board of D ental Examiners and Board of N ursing periodically communicate regarding PDMP registration. The B oard of Pharmacy communicates routinely about registration and reporting.43 42 Government Accountability Office. \"Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs: Views on Usefulness and Challenges of Programs ,\" October 2020. https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao -21-22.pdf .

(Accessed October 17, 2022). \"Patient matching convention is one of the top issues all PDMP managers are trying to address .\" Page 186 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 31 As reported in the 2021 legislative audit of Alaska's B oard of Pharmacy, each applicable practice board was at a different stage in implementing new controlled substance prescription database laws, and none of the boards, except the Board of Pharmacy, were fully monitoring or enforcing the PDMP requirements.44 Potentially noncompliant licensees are referred to the Division's investigative section for further review. Legislation authorizes the Board of Pharmacy to provide unsolicited notifications to a pharmacist or prescribing practitioner if prescriptions f or controlled substances are inconsistent with \"standards of safe practice.\" However, \"standards of safe practices\" have only been defined by two other practice boards (State Medical Board and Board of Dental Examiners). Chairs from each of the relevant pr actice boards formed a PDMP Board Chair group in 2020 to coordinate compliance; however, biweekly meetings and participation were insufficient, and the process has subsequently been discontinued. Beginning in the second quarter of calendar year (CY) 2020, mandatory use data reports were provided to prescribing boards quarterly. These reports provide de -identified data and general PDMP program information such as DEA licensure, PDMP registration, direct dispensers, use/compliance review findings, delinquent reports, recommendations, and statewide program updates. During a staffing crisis, the Governor issued an Administrative Order to mandate a focus on licensure and these reports were temporarily paused to allow staff time to assist where needed. The reports will resume in Q 4 2022. The Board of Pharmacy has annually prepared a PDMP report to the Alaska State Legislature ; however, the reporting month has not been consistent. Prescriber report cards are reflective of all opioids , anxiolytic, sedative, and hypnotic medications reported to the database and are unique to individual prescribers. AS 17.30.200(s) allowed the PDMP to generate and send these report cards to practitioners who hold a current DEA registration number, have registered with the PDMP, and have prescribed during the quarter on a quarterly basis. Since p harmacists and delegate are not prescribers, they do n ot receive a report card. Report cards were first issued i n December 2017. The report cards were previously sent confidentially, on behalf of the PDMP, from Bamboo Health to the email address associated with the practitioner's account. Findings from the Alaska PDMP 2021 PDMP Awareness & Feedback Survey indicated that 7 8% of physicians received a prescriber report card . Most respondent s were not surprised how they compared to other prescribers.45 Only a few changed prescribing patterns based on the report card. Starting in the third quarter of calendar year 2021, the report cards were available within the PDMP and allow the user to interact with the metrics of each section of their report. Copies are no longer emailed to each 44 Alaska State Legislature, D ivision of Legislative Audit. \"A Sunset Review of the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development (DCCED ),\" July 15, 2021. 45 NPC Research. \" Alaska's Prescription Drug Monitoring Program: Analysis of 2021 Awareness & Feedback Questionnaire ,\" January 2022. https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/Portals/5/pub/PDMPNPCAnalysis_2021.pdf (Accessed October 29, 2022).

Analysis of the Alaska 2021 PDMP Awareness & Feedba ck Survey results identified that only 11% of pres cribers and 8% of pharmacists were aware of registration resources for unsolicited prescriber \"report card.\"46 In 2014, the Board of Pharmacy established the current threshold for the multiple provider clinical alert or the \"5-5- 3 standard, \" which flags a patient who is doctor shopping if they see five or more prescribers or five pharmacies in three months. Policy and Process Review Noncompliance with PDMP registration, reporting, and review requirements , limits the effectiveness of the PDMP tool to reduce the misuse, abuse, and diversion of controlled substances. It also impacts ability to inform boards of potential disciplinary action needed for their licensees . Stakeholder Perspectives Prescribers reported t wo issues that put them at risk for noncompliance , even when they perceive they are using the system. The first is related the way the PD MP system records that a prescriber has checked PDMP information . With some nonintegrated EHR systems outside of a hospital emergency setting, PDMP information may automatically populate on the patient screen without the practitioner being technically logged into the PDMP . From a system perspective , the practitioner may appear to be noncompliant because there has not been an actual PDMP log - in. The second issue stems from complications in determining PDMP role assignment (s) for prescribing practitioners who may work in multiple settings (such as family practice clinic and an emergency department ), which may result in unnecessary investigations. Stakeholders also described the PDMP investigation environment as fraught with problems which may hinder the program's efforts to prevent excessive and harmful opioid prescriptions. Stakeholders reported PDMP investigations are bogged down too much on technical or compliance infractions (such as failing to pay registration fee s or registering late) at the potential expense of serious violations (overprescribing, exceeding morphine milligram equivalents [MMEs], and combinations of harmful medications). Stakeholders noted several challenges impacting the investigation process, including : 46 Ibid. \"The goal is we need to help people not die, rather than penalize doctors and pharmacies (for technical errors) .\" \"We're going after the minor infractions instead of preventing overdoses and going after providers who are putting patients at risk. \" Page 188 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 33 1. Unclear priorities on which cases to pursue. 2. Too many decisionmakers so investigative priorities change and are overridden. 3. Inadequate staffing with high caseloads . 4. Lack of automation of basic tasks, such as sending out notification letters and registration reminders , so investigators can focus on pursuing over prescribers and violations that could lead to overdose or death . 5. Lack o f integrated reporting systems, which would allow licensing examiners to track whether licensee s registered with the PDMP ; automatic PDMP activation when providers register for a license would also be useful (note: the automatic PDMP activation is schedule d to be enabled in early 2023). Considerations for Improvement Address the Division of Legislative Audit recommend ation to allocat e sufficient resources to ensure PDMP requirements are enforced.47 Identify clear priorities for PDPM investigations, focusing on the program's intent to reduce overprescribing and overdoses, especially during the current backlog of investigations . Hold licensing boards accountable to address compliance issues of their licensees and develop \"standards of s afe practice ,\" if they haven't already done so. Produce legislative reports on a more consistent annual timeline, preferably in the fall to allow legislator review prior to the legislation session starting in January. Data Sharing Current Construct To addr ess public concerns about their patient information, AS 17.20.200 (and 12 AAC 52.880) authorizes the PDMP database and information contained within the database are confidential, are not public records, are not subject to public disclosure, and may not be shared with the federal government. The Board of Pharmacy shall undertake to ensure the security and confidentiality of the database and information contained within the database. Information contained within the database are not released to federal, state , or local law enforcement unless a court- ordered subpoena or search warrant is presented with the request. Deidentified data can be shared the DOH with \"for the purpose of identifying and monitoring public health issues in the state.\" 47 Alaska State Legislature, Division of Legislative Audit. \"A Sunset Review of the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development (DCCED ),\" July 15, 2021. Page 189 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 34 At present, t he Ala ska PDMP faces challenges sharing data with DOH and reporting on certain federally required performance measures due to the lack of necessary inter -agency data sharing agreements , audit capacities, and data quality concerns.48 PDMP data are not effectively accessed by DOH for purpose s of monitoring public health issues and /or informing public health and safety approaches. The Alaska PDMP shares data with prescribers in 17 other states and the Military Health System through the National Assoc iation of Boards of Pharmacy's (NABP) PMP InterConnect program in conjunction with the AWAReX platform . AS 17.30.200(d)(3)(4) authorizes practitioners not licensed in Alaska to access patient prescription information from the Alaska PDMP, so long as the practitioner holds a license in another state. Practitioners licensed in these states do not have full access to the Alaska PDMP but may conduct a patient prescription history query to select states they are authorized to access. In return, practitioners licensed in Alaska may choose to include any or all seven states in a patient prescription history query . As of October 1, 2022, Alaska Medicaid receives de -identified data reports on PDMP use and trends from the PDMP data base vendor, Bamboo Health. The Alask a PDMP does not capture payor status. Policy and Process Review Early in state PDMP development, PDMPs were conceived as regulatory and law enforcement tools. 49 As a result, most early state PDMP laws did not permit PDMP data to be pro vided to public health officials. However, PDMPs are now widely recognized for their value as public health tools. PDMP data can be used by prescribing practitioners and pharmacists to improve prescribing practices and reduce prescription opioid- related harms, while health departments across the country are using PDMP data to inform public health interventions.50 PDMP utilization data are increasingly being used to identify fraud and abuse and informing healthcare policy around costs . Federal agencies such as the CDC recognize the critical role PDMP data plays in prevention. The CDC's Overdose Data to Action (OD2A) funding initiative supports entities in getting high quality, complete, and timelier data on opioid prescribing and overdoses, and the use of those data to inform prevention and response. As reflected in the OD2A logic model, inclusion of more timely or real -time PDMP data, increased application of PDMP data prevention and response 48 Alaska Depart ment of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development. \"Alaska Prescription Drug Monitoring Program Report to the 31st Alaska State Legislature (2018).\" https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/portals/5/pub/ PHA_PDMP_2020_LegislativeReport.pdf. (Accessed October 17, 2022). 49 Initially, the development and operation of PDMPs were funded largely by the DEA. For this reason, most early PDMP laws did not permit identified PDMP data to be provided to public health officials. 50 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"Leveraging Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) Data 28, 2022.) Page 190 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 35 activities, and increase d access for state health departments are core overdose prevention strategies.51 Alaska currently receives OD2A funding support for the PDMP (see funding section above). If there are data deficiencies, the PDMP can be weakened.52 Research has emphasized that to fully use PDMP, there was a need for data quality assurance and protection, enforcement and regulatory authority, and inter -agency collaboration.53 INTER -AGENCY SHARING The Health Insurance Portability and Accountabilit y Act (HIPAA), the federal law that governs access to and sharing of protected health information, does not generally limit the sharing of PDMP data for public health purposes. 54 While PDMPs do not themselves qualify as a covered entity, the entities th at house such programs may be subject to the Privacy Rule. For example, some states house their PDMP within the state health department, which may qualify as a covered entity, while other states locate their PDMP within an agency that generally does not qualify as a covered entity, such as a law enforcement agency or a licensing agency that regulates health professionals. To access PDMP data where PDMPs are not housed in health departments, the health department must rely on permissions granted under state law as well as agreements with the agency in which the PDMP is located. Some PDMP laws permit health departments to access only aggregate or de -identified data. In those states, MOUs or DUAs can be used to clarify the statute that governs the parties to wh om PDMP data may be released and the purposes for which it may be used to permit health departments to access and use identified PDMP data. However, many states now recognize the value of PDMP data to inform public health actions and several 51 CDC Overdose Data to Action (OD2A) Evaluation and Perfor mance Measurement Plan Template. 52 Lin, Dora H., Eleanor Lucas, Irene B.

In addition, certain Medicare providers also receive incentive payments based on criteria that inclu de querying PDMPs. The Promoting Interoperability Programs (previously known as the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs) provides incentive payments to eligible professionals and hospitals for the adoption and meaningful use of certified EHR technology. Providers report on a set of required measures and receive points based on their performance on the measures. Medicare providers can receive bonus points for the optional measure of querying a PDMP.58 Beginning in FFY 2023, states must annually report to the HSS Secretary on PDMP use and trends. Several PDMPS are sharing data with Medicaid for drug utilization review and to identify fraud and abuse. For drug utilization, 33 states currently have au thority to share and 37 states are working with Medicaid fraud and abuse. Patient privacy and confidentiality is extremely important for patient outcomes; they are also protected under the law. Federal and state privacy laws, including those applicable to PDMPs, provide protection for patients who seek or obtain medical care, and there are heightened legal protections for the privacy SUD treatment information. 42 CFR Part 2 (known as \"Part 2\") serves to protect patient records created by certain federally assisted programs for SUD treatment by certain federally assisted programs for SUD treatment by restricting the circumstances under which 42 CFR Part 2 Programs or other lawful holders can disclose such records. In July 2020, 42 CFR Part 2 regulations were revised to further facilitate better coordination of care in response to the opioid epidemic while maintaining confidentiality protections against unauthorized disclosure and use. The revised regulations went into effect i n 2020. Revised 42 CFR Part 2 regu lations now permit programs to report protected records (e.g., SUD medication 55 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"Leveraging Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) Data .

INTERSTATE DATA SHARING Federal agencies , such as DOJ and HHS, have support ed the establishment and enhancement of state PDMPs , includ ing funding, technical guidance, and data -sharing resources. Federal agencies have taken steps to encourage and facilitate interstate data sharing of PDMP information. Federal grant funds may be used to facilitate the exch ange of information and collection of prescriptions data and facilitate electronic information sharing among states. Since 2018, federal grant recipients must agree to ensure that their PDMP system has the capacity to exchange data with other PDMP systems via the RxCheck hub, a federal data exchange and EHR and health information exchange (HIE) integration platform. Most states make their PDMP information available to other states \u2014 such as neighboring states or more broadly \u2014 so that providers can see information about prescriptions that patients may have obtained in other states. State PDMPs may share all the information in patients' PDMP reports with other states \u2014 so out -of-state providers can see the same information as in -state providers \u2014 or they ma y share a portion of the information. Most states use one or both of the following two data -sharing hubs to facilitate the sharing of PDMP information between states, allowing providers to query other states' PDMP information from within their own state PDMP: Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) InterConnect: The National Association of Boards of Pharmacy created PMP InterConnect, in conjunction with a vendor. According to the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, as of August 2020, PDMPs in 48 state s, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Defense Health Agency were active participants in PMP InterConnect. RxCheck: RxCheck is funded by DOJ's Bureau of Justice Assistance and is governed by the RxCheck Governance Board. As of August 2020, 32 s tates and the District of Columbia have operating connections to RxCheck. 61 59 \"Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder Patient Records.\" Code of Federal Regulations, title 42, 2022, \u00a72.36. 60 This requirement is commonly referred to as \"Part 2\" for the regulations in which it is codified (42 C.F.R.

Specifically, Part 2 applies to federally assisted indiv iduals or entities including being a Medicaid/Medicare provider , being a nonprofit, receiving federal funds, or being licensed to prescribe or dispense methadone or buprenorphine . Not all pro viders that prescribe medication for opioid use disorder are Part 2 programs. 61 Government Accountability Office. \"Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs: Views on Usefulness and Challenges of Programs ,\" October 2020. https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao -21-22.pd f. (Accessed November 15, 2022 .) Page 193 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 38 Stakeholder Perspectives Stakeholder s stressed the importance of improving PDMP data sharing among government agencies and medical providers and breaking down data silos that limit the program's impact on patient care. Nationally, states are increasing their data sharing and analysis capacity as people see the potential for integrated data to suppor t prevention measures, health care policy, and patient outcomes , essentially using data to inform prevention and response . Recommendations for types of data to be shared include: DOH data and vital statistics for fatal and nonfatal overdoses. Arrest records in which types of crimes are correl ated with overdose frequency . DOH and e pidemiology studies to assess and mitigate population risk s. PDMP data between states, especially because of Alaska's seasonal workforce and visitor population. Medicaid data that can help identify fraud and abuse and affect claims authorization. PDMP trends and data provided to leaders of professional health care associations that provide education and outreach to medical providers . Data provided to hospital s on opioid u se for certain disease s, conditions , and procedures to allow for better decision -making and training . PDMP data on over prescribers provided to Medicaid and hospitals. Some stakeholder s reported a need for real -time data. PDMP entries may not show up for a day, allowing multiple prescriptions. \"People can do a lot of doctor -shopping in one day.\" Stakeholder s also recommended expanding available drug data by including more types of prescriptions within the PDMP . The primary purpose is to prevent harmful drug combinations and potential overdoses. Recommended additions to the PDMP include: Monitoring all medications not just controlled substance s. Prescriptions under Medicaid. Prescriptions on military bases . Methadone and other drugs used for addiction treatment. Considerations for Improvement Seek funding to enhance data infrastructure for effective data sharing. \"Data are the currency of health . If we don't have it and don't have reasonable interoperability, patients are harmed .\" \"Having data s ilos between government entities entrusted with the health of Alaskans basically creates paralysis and goes against ethical responsibility .\" \"If they can figure (real -time data sharing) out in the banking world, we can do so in the health info rmation exchange world .\" Page 194 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 39 Establish a framework for data integration and data sharing between state departments , i.e., DOH , Department of Corrections, Department of Public Safety . Allow and set guidelines for interstate health information exchanges so state entities can share data under specific conditions. Expand program capacity for customized queries . Establish criteria for expanding or reducing the number of interstate data sharing agreements. Integration Current Construct AS 08.80.030 (2018) states the DOH shall establish and implement a statewide electronic health information exchange system and ensure the interoperability and compliance of the system with state and federal specifications and protocols for exchanging health records and data. DOH has issued a current request for proposals for statewide HIE services .62 One implication for implementation of integration is broadband connectivity ; 29% of physicians cited limitation s with internet access as a barrier to using the PDMP.63 In 2021, 10 new PDM P integrations with health information systems occurred across Alaska. Alaska's current Statewide Gateway Integration program is a pilot program being offered to all end users to improve use of the PDMP. Gateway Integration provides a streamlined clinical workflow for providers by allowing users to query the PDMP database within an EHR/ Pharmacy Management System (PMS). The integration eliminates the need for providers to navigate to the web portal, log in, and enter the patient's information. Instead, a button is added to the EHR/PMS to pull the patient's PDMP report while in the provider's clinical workflow. This program is available to any health care facility in the state (small clinics, major hospitals, dentist offices, etc.) to integrate the PDMP into their EHR or PMS. The system uses a provider authorization that verifies that the provider has an active PDMP registration and an active DEA registration. If they do not, they cannot u se the system until they create an account. The funding for this was provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Overdose Data to Action (OD2A ) grant and will pay for integration services through September 2024. Funding for this program will continue based on availability of grant funding and increased utilization by providers in the state. A marketing approach is being developed and entities for potential 62 DOH is scheduled to issue an intent to award notice around November 30 and a contract issued by mid -December . 63 NPC Research. \"Alaska's Prescription Drug Monitoring Program: Analysis of 2021 Awareness & Feedback Questionnaire,\" January 2022. https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/Portals/5/pub/PDMPNPCAnalysis_2021.pdf (Accessed October 29, 2022). Page 195 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 40 prioritiz ation identified. It should be noted that integration efforts are complicated by the utilization of two data- sharin g hubs , RxCheck and PMP InterConnect. Although providers working in emergency settings are exempt from reviewing and reporting to the database, hospital providers in emergency departments review data contained within the PDMP because of collaboration among DCCED , the Alaska Hospital & Healthcare Association (AHHA), the Alaska Chapter of the American C ollege of Emergency Physicians (AK -ACEP), Collective Medical Technologies, and the State of Alaska's health information exchange established in AS 18.23.300.16. Through an interface service provided by Collective Medical Technologies , patient- specific information is automatically pulled from the PDMP without the emergency department provider logging into the PDMP. Collective Medical Technologies and stakeholders are working with CBPL to see if some of the program's deficiencies can be overcome. Policy and Process Review In a federally funded hospital -based pilot project, the PDMP data requests increased 145 -fold the year after integration, with a 22% decrease in hospital opioid prescriptions. During the same period, the PDMP data request rate increased by 28% statewide, with a 13% increase in hospital opioid prescriptions . 64 PDMP information can be integrated into different types of health IT s ystems, such as state or regional health information exchanges (HIE) and provider health IT systems such as EHRs and pharmacy dispensing systems. 65 In so me states, governments are covering the costs related to state integration options for providers. Ho wever, achiev ing integration for all providers within their states is challenging particularly with smaller providers , those who lack health IT systems , or those with older health IT systems and outdated technology. Qualitative research has identified some key factors influencing implementation of PDMPs such as linkage to electronic health records (EHR). 66 For example, physicians have identified lack of integration with EHR as a key challenge to most effectively using PDMP s when making pat ient care decisions. Without integration, physicians or their delegates must separately log into and search their state PDMP's website, which some physicians said could take several minutes per patient. This time can add up to a significant cumulative time burden for physicians who check 64 Wang, Lucy Xiaolu, \"The complementarity of drug monitoring programs and health IT for reducing opioid -related mortality and morbidity.\" Health Economics (2021): https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hec.4360#reference .

The flow chart on the next page demonstrates how several steps (and time) can be eliminated with EHR integration. Figure 3. PDMP EHR Integration Source: Adapted from GAO analysis of interviews with physicians and PMDP officials (GAO -21-22). From 2018 to 2022, ONC and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collaborated on the Advancing PDMP and EHR Integration project. The purpose of this project was to advance and scale vendor PDMP inte grations with health IT systems in a variety of hospital, primary care, and outpatient settings. Specific goals of the project included: Test and refine standards -based, nonproprietary approaches to enable effective integration of state PDMP data into heal thcare system EHRs, including integration into clinical workflows . 67 Government Accountability Office. \"Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs: Views on Usefulness and Challenges of Programs ,\" October 2020. https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao -21-22.pdf .

Page 197 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 42 Identify and advance promising vendor -agnostic approaches that support scalability and sustainability of PDMP - health IT integration . Explore emerging vendor -agnostic technical solutions to enhance access and use of PDMP data . Compile lessons learned and best practices that can be translated into vendor -agnostic, nonproprietary technical resources for states and health systems. As an outcome of this effort, ONC and CDC produced an Integrati on Framework and an Integration Toolkit to serve as technical resources to other organizations interested in integrations. The Integration Framework provides guidance to healthcare systems and relevant stakeholders to support successful project execution, management and communications for Health IT integrations related to PDMPs and clinical decision support for opioid prescribing.68 Federal grant funders require recipient programs to use RxCheck for interstate data sharing and integration efforts. However, state PDMP managers appear to be favor PMP InterConnect . While it fills a similar function as RxCheck, PMP InterConnect offers a better interface with multiple system platforms with EHR and PMS and is more technologically advanced. Many state PDMP managers also have growing concerns about the potential reach of RxCheck for federally sharing data and conditions for funding. The state is paying the licensing fee for the statewide integration program. This has the potential to lessen the int egration burden for some prescribing practitioners. Stakeholder Perspectives Effective integration into EHR systems is the key to PDMP usability, according to prescribers who were interviewed. Stak eholders indicate d a strong correlation exists between PDMP integration and positive attitudes toward the PDMP. Prescribe rs in settings with seamless integration (such as hospitals) report ed the PDMP is easy to use and is an effective tool. Those in settin gs with no or minimal integration (veterinarians, prescribers at small clinics and in specialty practices) said the PDMP is cumbersome and time -consuming, and they were more likely to call for exemptions for their field. 68 Health IT.gov. \"Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs.\" Last \"Integration t akes user - friendliness from a 3 to a 10 .\" Page 198 of 367 MCKINLEY RESEARCH GROUP 43 Considerations for Improvement Man age and communicate expectations of anticipated levels of statewide integration implementation, particularly related to small practice settings and regions with poor broadband connectivity.

Page 275 of 367TO: State Boards of Pharmacy FROM: Scott Brunner, CAE Chief Executive Officer Savannah Cunningham, PharmD Director of Public Policy DATE: December 2, 2022 SUBJECT: Update on compounded desiccated thyroid extract (DTE) The FDA has recently sent identical letters , attached here, to the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy and the Federation of State Medical Boards as follow -up to its September 16 letter to NABP stating that desiccated thyroid extract - and thus Thyroid USP - has been classified as a biologic drug and is therefore ineligible for compounding. The September 16 letter also state d that DTE \"can put patients at harm\" and that \"therapies containing DTE are biological products subject to licensure under Section 351(i) of the PHS Act.\" The new letters are what we believe to be an attempt to provide better guidance to state boards of pharmacy regarding state enforcement of FDA's previous letter to NABP, which may have been perceived by some boards of pharmacy as an FDA directive to enforce a ban on DTE c ompounding by 503A pharmacies. In the November 16 letters, FDA states that \"DTE products continue to be available, and FDA intends to make any additional information regarding DTE products available to the public. While the Agency continues to address any complaints related to DTE products prepared by state -licensed pharmacists, we have not to date taken steps more generally to remove products prepared by drug compounders containing DTE or limit compounder access to DTE .\" The letters also states that \"FDA expects to employ a risk -based enforcement approach with respect to violative compounded drugs, giving the highest enforcement priority to compounded drugs and violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and FDA regulations that pose the greates t public health risks, such as serious adverse events or serious product quality or adulteration issues.\" Based on our conversations with FDA officials, w e interpret those statements to mean that FDA intends, at least for the foreseeable future, to take no action against compounders of DTE unless they receive a complaint about adverse events or product quality \u2014in which case, the agency would commence an investigation of the pharmacy that prepared the DTE drug that is the source of the complaint. We urge state boards of pharmacy to adopt th at same position and take no enforcement action against compounders who prepare compounded DTE , at least until FDA changes its position. We must note that FDA's most recent letter fails to address the process by which FDA has reclassified DTE/Thyroid USP as a biologic in the first place. Our concerns are outlined below: Page 276 of 367 In its letter to NABP, FDA states that it considers thyroid USP to be a biologic based on a component in the product, thyroglobulin, that is not an active ingredient of the medication. The letter states the agency is making that judgment based on the number of amino acids in thyroglobulin under the definition of a protein under the definition of a biologic. (As further noted below, this is the only instance we're aware of of a drug being designated a biologic based on a component that is not the active ingredient. ) Currently , multiple manufactured thyroid USP drug products (NP Thyroid, Armour Thyroid, etc.) marketed and distributed by pharmaceutica l companies. These products are not listed in FDA's Purple Book, which tells us they are not the subject of a Biologics License Application (BLA) and are thus not biologic products. (We note that thyroglobulin is not listed in the Purple Book either.) If F DA's newly stated position on DTE also applies to those commercially available drugs - and we see no reason for differentiation between and compounded DTE - will they be required to have a biologics license to continue to manufacture them? FDA's letter cl aims that levels of the hormone can vary from batch to batch \u2014and yet the manufactured products make no mention of the thyroglobulin content in the package inserts of those products. Nor do those product labels provide any mention of thyroglobulin content. If the agency has such concerns about the hormone quantity, why is the presence of thyroglobulin absent in those products' insert and label? The package inserts and labeling of the manufactured thyroid USP products clearly describe levothyroxine and liothyronine as the active ingredients. Products that are deemed biologics are typically deemed so based on the active ingredient being the biologic agent, as opposed to a substance that is not described in any of the labeling, including the package insert. In addition to thyroglobulin not being the active ingredient, Section 503A of the FDCA allows for chemicals to be used as the API of a human drug compound if the chemical has an applicable USP monograph. FDA has indicated that applicabl e the \"drug\" monographs in USP has an applicable drug monograph, and thyroglobulin content is not a specification to be tested for in the monograph. In coming days, APC will be submitting formal comments to FDA outlining ou r concerns. We first raised those concerns with them verbally in a special meeting on November 9. We'll restate them in another listening session with FDA on December 13. Despite our ongoing concerns, we're grateful for FDA's willingness to respond to ou r request for more clarity on whether compounders may continue, at least for the time being, to prepare DTE for patients. We now know how FDA says it will approach that situation. We encourage your state board of pharmacy to adopt a stance identical to FDA 's so that patients in your state who rely on compounded DTE to live normal lives can continue to be served.

The purpose of this memo is to provide background and brief you on impact of regulation some states may be considering regarding compounded preparations for veterinary office use by both 503B outsourcing facilities and 503A pharmacies. In particular, we want to highlight the possible need for amending state regs to adhere to the guidance for industry document (GFI #256) on compounding animal drugs from bulk substances that was recently finalized by the Center for Veterinary Medicine (\"CVM\") at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") in April of this year. Background: As you may know, 503B outsourcing facilities were established by the amendments made to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (\"FDCA\") as part of the Drug Quality and Security Act (\"DQSA\") passed by Congress in November of 2013. Unlike traditional compounding pharmacies, which are licensed and regulated primarily at the state level and enjoy exemptions from certain federal drug manufacturing requirements in section 503A of the FDCA, outsourcing facilities mus t register with FDA, are subject to risk -based FDA inspections, must be compliant with current good manufacturing practices (\"cGMP\"), adhere to labeling requirements, and are also subject to federal adverse event reporting requirements. 1 In addition, whe n an outsourcing facility is compounding using bulk substances, the bulk drug substance must appear on a list developed by FDA of bulk drug substances that can be used in compounding under section 503B, or the drug compounded from the bulk drug substance m ust appear on FDA's drug shortage list at the time of compounding, distribution, and dispensing. However, outsourcing facilities are authorized to compound larger quantities of compounded preparations and to distribute those drugs to hospitals, clinics and other prescribers without a patient -specific prescription or dispense them pursuant to a patient -specific prescription as a traditional pharmacy would.2 Both section 503A and section 503B of the FDCA apply only to drugs compounded for human use and do not apply to animal drug compounding , and there is in fact no federal statute that establishes a federal regulatory framework over animal drug compounding. Compounding for veterinarians for animal use is of course a 1 See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 353b (2022) . 2 100 Alexandria, VA 22314 www.a4pc.org Page 278 of 367 Page 2 of 4 widespread practice that is integral to a nimal health care. It has been regulated for decades at the state level by boards of pharmacy and boards of veterinary medicine as part of the traditional practice of pharmacy. Despite clear legislative intent to the contrary, FDA and CVM take the position that the FDCA's definition of \"new drug\" is expansive enough to include drugs compounded for animal use and therefore all compounded animal drugs are \"new drugs\" that do not enjoy the exemptions from the drug manufacturing requirements in sections 503A an d 503B of the Act applicable only to human drug compounding. 3 The agency has taken the questionable legal position that provisions of the Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act (\"AMDUCA\") that allow for the extra -label use of certain human and animal drugs for the treatment of animals give the agency the authority to preempt state pharmacy and veterinary laws and regulate compounding for animal use. 4 As the Board is aware, off -label use is not compounding; but nonetheless, the agency has used t he off- label use language in AMDUCA to establish a federal regulatory framework for animal drug compounding for bulk substances in GFI #256, despite the lack of clear statutory authority to do so. Guidance for Industry #256 (finalized by FDA/CVM April 2022): GFI #256 states that \"This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA or Agency) current thinking on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the publ ic.\" Also, GFI #256 includes the statement that the guidance represents the agency's enforcement policy for animal drug compounding from bulk substances by \"veterinarians or pharmacists in either State -licensed pharmacies or Federal facilities (i.e., facil ities operated by the federal government).\" Footnote 2 at the bottom of page one notes that \" Throughout this guidance, the terms \"pharmacists,\" \"pharmacies,\" and \"veterinarians\" refer to those persons or entities that are State -licensed and operate in full compliance with State laws and regulations governing their practice.\"5 Based on comments from CVM, we believe the agency will use this footnote to include outsourcing facilities, particularly those included in state laws and regulations as entities requi red to be licensed by the state pharmacy board, as is the case in many states currently. GFI #256 applies only to drugs compounded for animal use from bulk substances and does not apply to animal drugs compounded from FDA- approved animal or human product s, which they assert is authorized under the AMDUCA off- label provisions referenced above. As it relates to non -food producing animals, the guidance establishes conditions under which CVM will exercise \"enforcement discretion\" from illegal manufacturing actions for pharmacies and veterinarians that adhere to its requirements. GFI #256 requires veterinarians and pharmacies to document the \"clinical difference\" that a drug compounded from bulk substances will have versus an FDA approved product, establishes a dverse event reporting requirements, and limits animal drug compounding from bulk substances for veterinary office stock to a positive list to be developed through nominations to and consideration by CVM. 6 APC and many other pharmacy and veterinary stake holders, 7 in addition to many Members of Congress,8 weighed in with CVM prior to the agency finalizing GFI #256 to express concerns about the legal authority of the agency to establish such a regulatory framework over animal drug compounding in a guidanc e document without clear statutory authority from Congress to do so. We also expressed substantive concerns and 3 See CVM GFI #256, p. 3 4 See (a)(5) 5 See CVM GFI #256 7 See GFI Enforcement Extension Letter July 2022 8 See Congressional FDA GFI 256 enforcement extension letter (08 -05-2022) and GFI_256_Lette r Page 279 of 367 Page 3 of 4 questions about how GFI #256 will be implemented and enforced by CVM. Although finalized in April of 2022 with a stated intention to begin enfor cement on October 1, 2022, CVM responded to stakeholder and congressional concerns by announcing in September that they would delay enforcement until at least April 1, 2023.9 APC and other pharmacy stakeholders continue to seek clarification from CVM on c ertain provisions in the guidance that will be critical to compliance and that will take time to incorporate into pharmacy and veterinary standard operating procedures. 10 Some of the issues we have raised that still need additional clarification from CVM i nclude the following: Clinical difference: GFI #256 imposes new burdens on how veterinarians write prescriptions and communicate with compounders requiring clinical difference statements. Sufficient time to create new systems to comply with these requ irements is necessary. Compounding from bulk: GFI #256 will require new record keeping practices for compounders and the necessity to put new systems in place to ensure documentation of rationales when bulk drug substances are being used. Adverse event reporting: The threshold for an \"adverse event\" is only described generally and needs to be clarified by the agency prior to enforcement. FDA's list for office stock drugs: Until veterinarians and compounders have clarity on the process and have an adequate opportunity to nominate products for the list - and CVM has had time to review the nominations - this requirement will likely result in many drugs being immediately unavailable. Labeling: Compounded products are not FDA -approved drugs so there is no FDA -approved indication for use; therefore, compounders cannot identify an indication on the label, though this is required by GFI #256. Outsourcing Facilities: CVM removed from final GFI #256 references to 503B outsourcing facilities that were included in earlier versions of the guidance. However, the agency has indicated that outsourcing facilities will be required to meet GFI #256's requirements and will be limited in compounding animal drugs from bulk substances for office stock to the positive list of substances now under development. Stakeholders have inquired whether additional or separate guidance applicable to outsourcing facilities is necessary. APC recommendations for future state regulations: APC supports authorizing both 503A state l icensed pharmacies and 503B outsourcing to compound drugs for animal use, including drugs needed by veterinarians to administer to their animal patients or to dispense to the animal patient's owner or caretaker. The location and unique circumstances of a veterinarian practice and the wide variety of animal patients treated by that practice affect whether they may need to order compounded drugs from a pharmacy or from an outsourcing facility. Outsourcing facilities must comply with cGMP standards that make providing smaller batches of compounded drugs on shorter timeframes to veterinarians much more difficult than for pharmacies. State laws and regulations should reflect the need for that flexibility and access while not conflicting with the requirements pu t on pharmacies and outsourcing facilities in federal law, regulation, and agency policy guidance. APC's position is that quantity caps on pharmacy compounding of animal drugs for office stock based on arbitrary percentages or days of supply are inappropr iate both for 503A pharmacies and for 503B outsourcing facilities and points out that FDA/CVM intend to apply GFI #256 to both types of entities and the guidance contains no such limitations. FDA has never stated or issued guidance asserting that only outs ourcing facilities can provide animal drug office stock or that the agency \"prefers\" outsourcing facilities over pharmacies to 9 See Response to Joint Pharmacy Request for Delay 9_9_22 10 See GFI 256 Questions for CVM Letter Page 280 of 367 Page 4 of 4 provide animal drug stock to veterinarians. To the contrary, GFI #256 sets forth the conditions and limitations on animal drug compounding from bulk substances for office stock for both pharmacies and outsourcing facilities and does not contain any such quantity limitations; but rather, limits both entities to bulk substances on a positive list under development by CVM. 11 Therefore, as APC and other pharmacy and veterinary stakeholders continue to seek further clarification from CVM about GFI #256 ( and seek to work with NABP toward model regulations that are consistent with the federal guidance on animal drug compounding ), the State Boards should be prepared to consider additional revisions to these sections based on that clarification of GFI #256 and any model regulations that should be developed by NABP. APC is committed to keeping Boards of Pharmacy informed of these efforts and to make further recommendations as necessary. We hope you will see our organization as a helpful resource on this and other pharmacy compounding matters. Recap of APC Suggested Board Actions: When considering state regulations, there should be no arbitrar y quantity limitation on pharmacies or outsourcing facilities providing vet office stock to protect animal patient access and maintain consistency with federal law as expressed in GFI #256. Boards should track GFI #256 and any clarifications, revisions or extensions of enforcement made by CVM and prepare to revise regulations to align with federal law as expressed in GFI #256. Boards should u rge NABP to work with other pharmacy and veterinary stakeholders to create model regulations on animal drug compound ing, both patient specific and non -patient -specific, that align with federal law as expressed in GFI #256 to provide vets and pharmacists consistency and predictability in the regulations of animal drug compounding which will improve both animal patient safety and access to needed compounded animal drugs.

MELISSA PAGE PHARMACIST February 02, 2023 Page 3 of 3 Page 288 of 367Meeting Summary Call with Dr. Andre Neptune, Executive Director of Pharmacy, Providence Alaska Dr. Neptune has been approached about providing pharmacy services for a proposed Crisis Stabilization Unit, a stand -alone facility designed to provide health care services to patients in mental health crisis and/or substance miss -use. It would be both a short and extend ed stay (chairs and beds) facility. In other states, these units are licensed independently (i.e. not under a hospital), have their own DEA registration, and have a drug -room but do not have a pharmacy. They also have a contracted consultant pharmacist, s imilar to what we do in licensed drug rooms in critical access hospitals and/or long -term care facilities. Dr. Neptune is seeking guidance from the board of pharmacy about our current regulations and whether or not we have anything in regulations or statutes that would address how we oversee pharmacy services in a Crisis Stabilization Unit. What types of pharmacy services, e.g.: administering/dispensing/patient counseling, etc. will the unit provide? ambulatory clinic -planned care Will it be facilitated w ith or an extension of Providence Medical Center? If so, this may fall under the category of an alternate care site, which is permitted and does not require a new application or license . short stay unit/urgent care -patients in crisis -stabilized 20 chairs ~ If it is an independent clinic, what will the oversight structure be, e.g.: will the contracted consultant pharmacist be in charge of the unit's whole operations and services? long term stay-up to 7 days/ Page 289 of 367From: SCHNABEL Joseph * BOP To: Bowles, Michael P (CED) Subject: CPE for Board Meeting Attendance Date: Wednesday, get email from joseph.schnabel@bop.oregon.gov. Learn why this is important Hi Michael - Oregon does allow up to 2 hours of CPE per renewal cycle for pharmacists and technicians. I am attaching our recently adopted CPE rules (see p. 10) overhaul and below is the CPE claim form forthis activity: Licensees may request Oregon CPE (non-ACPE) for the policy and rule discussion portions of anOregon Board of Pharmacy board meeting by completing this request form . Credit will be issued in 15 minute increments. Attendance will be verified against records retained by theagency for the board meeting. So far, we have had few pharmacists in attendance at our meetings since the onset of COVID, but weare hopeful that some start showing up again as we get out of the current respiratory virus season. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions.

The Oregon Board of Pharmacy allows thisand I was hoping to speak with Mr. Schnabel about how your Board accomplishes this. Thank you inadvance! MultiPage PDF File (nabp.pharmacy) Respectfully,Michael BowlesExecutive AdministratorAlaska (907) 465-1073 From: Al 26, 2022 1:43 PM (CED) RE: ACPE Accreditation for Board Meeting Participation Hi Michael and Laura: Happy Holidays! Attached are the states that currently offer or have previously offered CE credit for attending a Board meeting. None of these states offered ACPE-accredited CPE; they handled the recordkeeping and rules on their own. If NABP were to accredit the Alaska Board meetings, the best way for us to do so would be if Alaskaonly allows licensees to attend one meeting per year. Administratively, this would make it easier onour end and less paperwork for the Board over time. We would not be able to provide partial credit,so the Board should keep the number of hours they wish to give conservative (or, mandate fullmeeting attendance for more credits). Let me know your thoughts and if further discussion is in order to plan this and move forward. Thanks in advance.

Below are our questions for states: What states have accredited their board meetings? Is the accreditation a Joint Partnership with an ACPE-accredited provider or is your board solely responsible for the \"program\"? How many CEs/contact hours are earned for meeting attendance? Are licensees able to participate in more than one meeting to earn credit for the renewalcycle? Can credit be earned by board members or just attending licensees?

Brad brought a unique voice to the Board's conversations during his years of service. His focus on the practicality of the information technology angle on contemporary issues facing the pharmacy profession today regularly helped inform the Board and its policy discussions. Some of the Board's accomplishments during his tenure include the establishment of the drug outlet conduct rules and receipt of the 2013 Fred T. Mahaffey Award from the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy \u00ae for exceptional contributions to the health and welfare of the public. Additionally, the Board established new types of outlet registrations to keep up with evolving technology in the industry, including consulting or drugless pharmacies, remote processing and central fill, and the Technician Checking Validation Program, all with strong advocacy and input from Brad. His contributions have been invaluable , and he will be greatly missed! The Board would also like to introduce its new pharmacist member, Rachael DeBarmore, who graduated from the Oregon State University (OSU) College of Pharmacy in 1998. Rachael has gained well-rounded exposure to community pharmacy practice through work experiences at different levels within organizations in this state. Rachael started her career as a pharmacy technician and has worked through the tiers of management from ground level pharmacy management to the director of pharmacy . She has worked in a mass merchant operation and grocery/pharmacy organization and currently is a pharmacy district manager with Rite Aid. Rachael has been actively involved in the pharmacy community ; she has served as a board of directors member of the Oregon State Phar\u00ad macy Association, participates in the Oregon Pharmacy Coalition , and interacts regularly with students and faculty at both OSU and Pacific University. Rachael currently resides in Keizer, OR, with her husband and three sons. In other business, are you aware that you can attend the Board's open session meetings, and that you can earn continuing education (CE) credit as an added bonus for attending? Up to 0.4 Oregon CEUs (four contact hours) per day are issued (two hours for the morning and two hours for the afternoon). Please consider this great way of getting CE related to law, licensure, and policy. The Board meets about every other month, typically over two to three days, in February, April, June, August, October, and December. Occasion\u00ad ally, these meetings take place outside the Portland, OR area. For dates and locations, please visit www.oregon.gov/pharmac y/Pages/ Meetings.aspx. The Board looks forward to seeing you! OR Vol. 37, No. 2 No. 566: CPTs Transition to Biennial Licensure New rules related to Oregon pharmacy technicians are now filed and in effect. The rules state that a Certified Oregon Pharmacy Technician (CPT) license will be valid for up to two years and will be renewed biennially (every two years). The CPT licenses issued henceforth will expire on June 30 in even-numbered years. There are also changes to CE requirements. CPTs must complete 20 CE hours during the period from July 1 through June 30 of each biennial license renewal cycle. This means that upon renewal in 2016, a CPT license will expire June 30, 2018, in this shift to biennial licensure. CPT licenses issued beginning on July 1, 2016, will expire June 30, 2018, and so on every even-numbered year. Additionally , these rules bring clarification to license requirements and update parameters for CPT licensure reinstatement. A full set of the rules are available at www.oregon.gov/pharmacy /Pages/Laws _ Rules.aspx. The Board realizes this is a big transition for our licensees and has created some frequently asked questions (FAQs) to assist per\u00ad sons seeking information . Because the CPT license being renewed this year in 2016 was previously a one-year license, the CE require\u00ad ments for this cycle are different than they are in future biennial license cycles. For this reason, please understand that these FAQs specifically relate to this year's (2016) license renewal process. QI: How many hours of CE do I have to have completed in order to renew my Board CPT license for this year's renewal? Al: Your CE must be completed in the period of September 1, 2015, to August 31, 2016, and prior to submitting your renewal. Required CE includes one hour of pharmacy law, one hour of patient safety or medication error prevention, and eight hours of your choice of relevant pharmacy CE or Board-approved on-site training. Q2: Does my Pharmacy Technician Certification Board or National Healthcareer Association national certification have to be active to renew my CPT (state license)? A2: No. The Board no longer requires maintenance of national certification for licensure renewal; however, it is still required for the initial CPT license. Q3: Do I have to do the law CE on the Board website? A3: No. The pharmacy law CE on the Board website is one option available for your law CE, but is not required. Q4: Does my CE have to be \"live\" or \"technician-specific\" to count for my CPT? A4: No. Oregon does not require live or technician-specific CE; however, it is encouraged that your CE be relevant to your continued on page 4 Page 1 Page 312 of 367Page 313 of 367Page 314 of 367National Association of Boards of Pharmacy Foundation 1600 Feehanville Drive Mount Prospect, IL 60056 OREGON STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY continued from page 1 practice setting. Additionally, the national certification entities may have extra requirements. QS: My initial CPT license was issued after October 1, 2015. Was I supposed to complete the 10 CE hours? AS: No. Oregon Administrative Rule (OAR) 855-025-0015(2)(c) states that the CE requirement \"does not apply to Certified Oregon Pharmacy Technicians applying for the first renewal of their license if they have not been licensed by the Board for at least one year prior to October 1 of the renewal period.\" Q6: I am ready to begin preparing for my next CPT license renewal. In what time frame do I need to do my 20 hours of CE for the 2018 renewal? A6: Twenty hours of CE must be completed from July 1, 2016, to June 30, 2018, for the renewal cycle in spring 2018. CE require\u00ad ments are doubled from the annual renewal requirement (two hours of law, two hours medication safety, and 16 \"other\"/ approved on-site training hours). Q7: How do I change my address with the Board? A7: When completing the online renewal, simply type in the cor\u00ad rect information. Outside the renewal cycle you may submit an email or fax, or use the online electronic address/employment change form available at www.oregon .gov/pharmacy/Pages/ Address_ Change.aspx. Important note: The Board performs random CE audits for every renewal cycle. If selected this year, you will be required to provide proofofCE completed between the dates of September 1, 2015, and August 31, 2016, and prior to submitting your license renewal. If you are audited and it is found that you did not complete the required CE, you will be subject to disciplinary action. Please be sure to contact Board staff if you need clarification. No. 567: Compliance Pearls -To Fill or Not to Fill The Board's compliance department receives many inquiries related to expectations of how a pharmacist is expected to evaluate a new prescription for validity. This article describes some tools and methods one can use. The duties of a pharmacist receiving a prescription are outlined in OAR 855-019-0210. It states that a pharmacist must ensure that all prescriptions, prescription refills, and drug orders are correctly dis\u00ad pensed or prepared for administration in accordance with the prescrib\u00ad ing practitioner's authorization. Additionally, a pharmacist receiving a prescription order is responsible for using professional judgment in dispensing only pursuant to a valid prescription. A pharmacist shall not dispense a prescription if the pharmacist in his or her professional judgment believes that the prescription was issued without a valid patient-practitioner relationship. The prescription must be issued for a Presorted Standard U.S. Postage PAID Chicago, Illinois Permit No. 5744 legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of his or her professional practice and not result solely from a questionnaire or an internet-based relationship. Prescriptions Written by Practitioners for Themselves or Family Members Pharmacists regularly inquire about the legality of filling prescrip\u00ad tions written by a practitioner for him/herself or a family member. The Board does not regulate other licensed health care professionals. However, it can refer to the guidance other boards have given. For example, the Oregon Medical Board states that it is \"generally unwise to treat oneself or a family member\" and \"cautions licensees against self-prescribing\" and \"suggests that a practitioner never prescribe narcotics or benzodiazepines under these circumstances.\" (Oregon Medical Board Report, Winter 2011.) Additionally, the Medical Board provides guidance in a newsletter FAQ article that asks, \"May I prescribe medication to my spouse or family member when her/his physician is unavailable?\" The answer states, \"Yes, if you don't make it a habit, and you evaluate and chart your workup ... just like any other patient, and it's not for a scheduled drug.\" (Oregon Medical Board Report, Summer 2008.) While there are certainly times that exceptions can be made for emergent circumstances, a pharmacist is expected to utilize professionalism when faced with this type of situation. Prescriptions Written by and Refills Authorized Prior to a Practitioner Retiring Pharmacists often question whether they can fill or refill a prescrip\u00ad tion written by a prescriber who is no longer in practice. The answer is based upon common sense and on the pharmacist's judgment. As long as the prescription was valid when originally issued to the patient, and as long as the condition for which the drug was prescribed still applies to the patient, it may be dispensed. The pharmacist should evaluate each patient and each situation individually to allow reasonable time for the patient to establish care with another practitioner. There is no \"exact science\" or \"legal time frame\" to follow. Determinations are based on professional judgment. Document what you do and under\u00ad stand that refilling prescriptions beyond a reasonable time period without medical supervision is not appropriate.
