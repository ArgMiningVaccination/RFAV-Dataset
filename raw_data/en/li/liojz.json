COVID -19 vaccines are critical tools in reducing new cases and ending the pandemic. Vaccinations are especially important for nursing home staff who are at the front lines of the pandemic. COVID -19 vaccinations will protect nursing home staff at work and in the community and protect nursing home residents. However, staff may have questions or concerns about the safety of the vaccines or be hesitant to take the vaccine due to myths and misinformation. These 10-minute modules provide nursing home staff with fact -based information on the safety of the COVID -19 vaccines to increase vaccination rates among staff. Using the modules helps raise staff awareness of accurate information and encourages an open dialogue to discuss concerns about the COVID -19 vaccination. The modules are designed to be presented during shift change reports, unit or department huddles, or small department meetings to support an environment where staff feel comfortable responding to or seek ing out one- on-one vaccination discussions with facility leaders. Planning Tips for the Nursing Home Education Leader: Determine whether your facility will focus on one module a day, over a series of six days (recommended), or one module per week. Using al l five modules and conducting the sixth module, which is a follow -up activity, is recommended; however, you can choose modules that address the concerns of front line staff in your facility which may or may not include all five topic areas. Additionally, t here is no specific order of sequence for presenting these modules. Identify the supervisors who will be responsible for delivering the modules. Make sure that the module of the day/week is covered on every shift, in every department or unit that has unvaccinated staff. Provide this guide to the supervisors who will be responsible for delivering the modules and indicate the schedule for delivering the modules (e.g., daily at shift change on each nursing unit). Print the flyer that accompanies each module and state the expectation for its use (i.e., changed each day so it reflects the daily huddle topic, posted in staff work area.) Print a few extra flyers and post them throughout the facility to reinforce the daily or weekly huddle topic. Make sure supervis ors have access to timely, accurate information about the facility's staff vaccination goal and rate and their unit/department rate so they can share these at the beginning of each huddle. Present the module of the day or week at the facility's morning lea dership/stand up meeting. This supports increased communication to frontline staff. Seek out feedback from supervisors and staff about the huddles to gauge their effectiveness. Coordinate internally with other leaders so w hen vaccine is offered to staff, your facility can celebrate and help them make visible their decision to get vaccinated (e.g., stickers, vaccine \"champion\" of the month/week, etc.). Engage staff members with resources from modules and other supporting resources listed on the following page, such as flyers, to keep vaccination awareness levels high after all modules are presented. 4 Resource Website Image of Resource COVID -19 Vaccines Flyers Available in multiple languages .

If you intend to have a staff member share a personal story related to the module topic, speak with them in advance of the hudd le so he or she is prepared to focus remarks appropriately and stays within the allotted time. If you will be sharing a video clip or other online resource as part of the huddle, view it ahead of time and have it ready to play before starting the huddle. Familiarize yourself with the questions and answers in the module. It is best to communicate the answers without reading each one; however, refer to the questions as needed. Encourage sharing and discussion as you present the content in each module. Remin d staff that this is a safe space for sharing concerns and asking questions. Encourage input from all staff participating in the huddle; elicit perspectives from staff who have not spoken up. Each module begins with a check -in on the status of your facili ty's goal for staff vaccines and when the next vaccination date will occur. Post and routinely update this information on a whiteboard or status sheet in a location that is accessible to all staff. Bring the status sheet or refer to the whiteboard in each huddle. 6 Module 1 Are the COVID- 19 Vaccines Safe? Facilitator Preparation for the Huddle Review Module 1 content so you will have a thorough understanding of the material. Print CDC flyer: Getting 'Back to Normal' is Going to Take All of Our Tools Obtain updated data on your facility's vaccination status and bring to huddle. Identify a direct care staff member who, if possible, has had the COVID -19 vaccine but was initially hesitant and ultimately changed his or her mind. Plan to arrive on time, if not 5 minutes before scheduled huddle. Identify how and where staff can post questions and review the resources you share during this huddle. Be prepared to give them directions. Anticipated time to present Module 1: 10 minutes Conduct the Huddle SAY: Everyone's goal is to REDUCE the RISK of COVID -19 infection and help to keep you, your coworkers, family, friends, and residents safe. Today we are beginning a short, five- part series to review and discuss common questions and concerns you may have about the COVID -19 vaccines. My goal is to provide you with the most up-to-date and accurate information available. The first topic we will discuss relates to COVID -19 vaccine safety. First, let's check in on our vaccination status : Our goal for staff vaccines is ___% and we are currently at __ _% Our next vaccination date is: ______________________. Our question for review today is: Are the COVID vaccines safe? They were created so quickly. ASK: Do a couple of people have any initial thoughts or opinions on how safe the COVID -19 vaccine is that you would like to share? Note: Keep discussion brief to stay on schedule. Thank staff member(s) for sharing their thoughts. SAY: During a health crisis , the government can give permission for emergency use of a vaccine. Even in an emergency and as with all other vaccines, thorough testing occurs before it can be available for public use. The new COVID -19 vaccines are based on vaccines developed for other coronaviruses, which increased the speed that they could be adequately tested. In the case of the COVID -19 vaccines, every standard was met and approved; no steps were skipped. Clinical trials, which are detailed experiments testing the vaccines to make sure they are safe and effective, were conducted before the vaccines were approved and rolled out to the public. To meet requirements of vaccine testing, a minimum of 3,000 people must participate in a clinical trial. For the COVID -19 vaccines, a range o f 30,000 to 50,000 people participated in clinical trials. Testing also indicated that the risk for a severe reaction to the COVID -19 vaccine is very low. o The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS - pronounced \"vairs\"), managed by the CDC and th e Food and Drug Administration (FDA), reported severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) in only 2 to 5 people per million vaccinated in the United States. Additionally, 7 VAERS did not detect patterns in severe reactions that would indicate a safety issue wit h the COVID -19 vaccines.1 ASK: So, based on this information I shared with you, what are your thoughts about how quickly the COVID -19 vaccine was created? ASK: Some of us have received the COVID -19 vaccine; would anyone like to share your vaccine story ? (Invite staff member you identified prior to the huddle to share his/her story) What made you nervous? What helped you overcome that nervousness? Was there any specific thing that made you change your mind? Can you describe your vaccine experience; did you have any side effects? How do you feel about your decision now? Huddle Wrap -Up ASK: Does anyone have any other questions or concerns about vaccine safety that I may be able to address now or can be sure to address over the next few days? (Capture any key points of clarification or lingering questions that need to be addressed. ) SAY: The information from the clinical trials demonstrates that the known and potential benefits of this vaccine outweigh the known and potential harms of becoming infected with the COVID -19 virus. If you have questions you would like addressed privately, please speak with me or your manager. You ca n also post your questions [indicate where in your facility, and how (e.g., bulletin board, whiteboard, question box)]. Be sure to visit [indicate the location in your facility] to read today's poster and other information on the COVID -19 vaccine.

Facilitator Preparation for the Huddle Review Module 2 content so you have a thorough understanding of the material. Print the one- page handout from AHCA: Get Vaccinated. Stop the Pandemic. Save Lives! Obtain updated data on your facility's vaccination status and bring to huddle. Identify a direct care staff member who has had the COVID -19 vaccine and ask if he or she is willing to share the vaccine side effects he or she experienced with the group. Plan to arrive on time, if not 5 minutes before scheduled huddle. Identify how and where staff can post questions and review the resources you share during this huddle. Be prepared to give them direct ions. Anticipated time to present Module 2: 10 minutes Conduct the Huddle SAY: Today we will discuss the possible side effects of the COVID -19 vaccine and compare those side effects to COVID -19 symptoms. First, let's check in on our vaccination status: Our goal for staff vaccines is ___% and we are currently at ___% Our next vaccination date is: ______________________. Our first question for review today is: Can COVID -19 vaccines give me COVID -19? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have confirmed that there is no live COVID -19 virus in the vaccines. This means that the COVID -19 vaccine cannot make you sick with COVID -19. ASK: Would a couple of people like to share what you believe are some of the common side effects of the COVID - 19 vaccine? Note: Keep discussion brief to stay on schedule. Thank staff member(s) for sharing their thoughts. SAY: Side effects occur because the vaccine teaches our body's defense system (immune system) how to recognize and fight the COVID -19 virus. The most common side effect is soreness for 1- 2 days at injection site. Some people may also experience headache, muscl e pain, joint pain, fatigue, chills, and fever. These symptoms go away within a few days. These side effects are normal, common, and expected. Some reaction is a good thing; your body is doing its job! These side effects may be more noticeable with the s econd vaccine but have not proven to be serious. Severe reactions due to COVID -19 vaccines are rare. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS (pronounced \"vairs\")), managed by the CDC and the FDA, reported severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) in 2 to 5 people per million vaccinated in the 9 United States. Additionally, VAERS did not detect patterns in cause of death that would indicate a safety issue with the COVID -19 vaccines.2 If you have a history of severe allergic reaction to any other v accine or injectable therapy, you should talk with your healthcare provider. ASK: Has anyone who has had the vaccine be willing to share the side effects that you experienced? (Invite previously recruited staff member to share his/her story) Did you experience side effects after one shot or both? How long did you have these side effects? What did you do, if anything, to help with the side effects? SAY: Our final question for review today is: If I am experiencing side effects from the vaccine, should I come to work? Staff can return to work without viral testing for COVID -19 if they feel well enough and are willing to work; do not have a fever; and symptoms are limited to those observed following the vaccine, such as soreness at injection sit e, muscle pain or headache. If you have more than the common side effects of COVID -19 vaccination after receiving your injection, call your healthcare provider for guidance. Huddle Wrap -Up ASK: How do you think the vaccine side effects would compare to how you would feel if you had COVID -19? Does anyone have any other questions or concerns about the side effects of the vaccine that I may be able to address now, or can be sure to address over the next few days? (Capture any key points of clarification or lingering questions that need to be addressed. ) SAY: The COVID -19 vaccination will help protect you from getting COVID -19. You may have some side effects, which are normal signs that your body is building protection. These side effects may affect your ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days. If you have questions you would like addressed privately, please speak with me or your manager. You can also post your q uestions [indicate where in your facility, and how (e.g., bulletin board, whiteboard, question box)] .

Identify how and where staff can post questions and review the resources you share during this huddle. Be prepared to give them directions. Anticipated time to present Module 3: 10 minutes Conduct the Huddle SAY: Long- term care staff like us continue to be on the front lines of the nation's fight against this deadly pandemic. Today, we are going to talk about how pre- existing health conditions and race, or ethnicity can put some people at a greater risk of acquiring COVID -19. First, let's che ck in on our vaccination status: Our goal for staff vaccines is ___% and we are currently at ___% Our next vaccination date is: ______________________. ASK: Why do you think some people have a higher risk of getting COVID -19, even though they are not elderly? Note: Keep discussion brief to stay on schedule. Thank staff member(s) for sharing their thoughts. SAY: Our first question for review today is: Does COVID -19 pose a greater risk to some individuals? Social determinants of health (SDOH) are conditions in the places where people live, learn, work, and play that affect a wide range of health risks and outcomes. These circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power, and resources at global, national, and local levels. Social determi nants of health are mostly responsible for health inequities - the unfair and avoidable differences in health status. People with pre- existing conditions like cancer or a weakened immune system might be at an increased risk for severe illness from the virus that causes COVID -19.3 This could include difficulty breathing or chest pain or pressure that could result in an admission to the hospital intensive care unit . Chronic diseases like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, asthma, other chronic respiratory diseases , and sickle cell anemia also can increase the risk of severe illness for people who become infected with COVID -19. Many of these diseases are more common in the African American, Hispanic, or Native American populations in the United States. People with fewer economic advantages can experience c hallenges with health insurance and affordable healthcare, access to transportation, and taking time off work to see the doctor. This can make it harder to control chronic diseases, be tested for COVID -19, and obtain tre atment. 3 Certain Medical Conditions and Risk for Severe COVID -19 Illness | CDC 11 The environmental conditions in the places where people live, learn, work, play, and worship affect can increase health risks. Some examples include: o Working in an environment serving others (essential workers) in close contact with many people (e.g., frontline healthcare workers, bus drivers, janitors, grocery store clerks, wait staff). o Living in a household with many family members who have high- risk jobs that involve facing the public daily. ASK: How do you think COVID -19 related hospitalization s and deaths among African Americans, Hispanics , and Native Americans compare with Whites? DO: Present the CDC infographic: COVID -19 Cases, Hospitalizations, and Deaths by Race/Ethnicity . Review (or point out) the rates of cases , hospitalizations and deaths comparing white/non- Hispanic persons to African American, Hispanic or Latino, and Native American persons. Review statistics and details under \"Text Version\" for key talking points. SAY: Our last question for review today is : Are any populations at a higher risk of side effects from the vaccine? The clinical trials did not identify any specific safety concerns for the vaccines by age, race, ethnicity, underlying medical conditions, or previous COVID -19 infection.4,5 Prote ction is critical because even though many people with COVID -19 have only a mild illness, others may get a severe illness , have long-term health effects, or even di e. While t here is no way to know how COVID -19 will affect you, your risk may be greater if you are African American, Hispanic or Latino, or Native American. Regardless of someone's race or ethnicity, the COVID -19 vaccine works by teaching our bodies how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID -19, and this protects you from getting sick with COVID - 19. Huddle Wrap -Up ASK: What are your thoughts about the risk of COVID -19 vaccin ation versus the risk of COVID -19 illness, including the severe symptoms we discussed? Does anyone have any other questions concerning how COVID- 19 impacts different populations differently that I may be able to address now, or can be sure to address over the next few days? (Capture any key points of clarification or lingering questions that need to be addressed.) SAY: The COVID -19 vaccine is a protection that is safe for all regardless of race or ethnicity. We have an opportunity to turn these numbers around and reduce sickness and death. If you have questions you would like addressed privately, please speak with me or your manager. You can also post your questions [indicate where in your facility, and how (e.g., bulletin board, whiteboard, question box)] . 4 ACIP Evidence to Recommendations for Use of Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine under an Emergency Use Authorization | CDC 5 EtR for Pfizer- BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine under EUA | CDC 12 Be sure to visit [indicate the location in your facility] to read today's poster and other information on the COVID -19 vaccine.

Obtain updated data on your facility's vaccination status and bring to huddle. Plan to arrive on time, if not 5 minutes before scheduled huddle. Ident ify how and where staff can post questions and review the resources you share during this huddle. Be prepared to give them directions. Anticipated time to present Module 4: 10 minutes Conduct the Huddle SAY: Today we are going to discuss concerns and questions related to the COVID -19 vaccine and how it impacts our DNA, fertility, and those who might be pregnant or breastfeeding. It is completely reasonable to want to understand what the COVID -19 vaccine does or does not do in our bodies. First, let's check in on our vaccination status: Our goal for staff vaccines is ___% and we are currently at ___% Our next vaccination date is: ______________________. Our first question for review today is: Will a COVID -19 vaccine alter my DNA? According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the COVID -19 vaccines do not change or interact with your DNA in any way. Some of the COVID -19 vaccines are messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccines, that teach our cells how t o make a protein that triggers a natural defense to safely develop an immune response. The mRNA in a COVID -19 vaccine never enters the part of the cell where our DNA is, which is called the nucleus (or the \"brains\" of the cell). This means the mRNA cannot affect, interact with, or modify our DNA in any way. COVID -19 messenger RNA vaccines do not change the cells in your body. Instead, they use your natural defenses to build up a protective response. Viral vector vaccines are another type of COVID -19 vaccine. Viral vector vaccines use harmless pieces of protein that cause your body to respond and create antibodies against COVID -19. Similar to the mRNA vaccines, viral vector vaccines do not enter your DNA. After you are vaccinated, if you are exposed to COVID -19 your body can quickly protect itself against the COVID -19 virus before it can make you seriously ill. Our next question for review today is: Can I get the COVID -19 vaccine if I am pregnant or breastfeeding? According to the CDC, women who are pregnant or breastfeeding and part of a group recommended to receive the COVID -19 vaccine, like healthcare workers, may choose to be vaccinated.6 The actual risks of COVID -19 vaccines to the pregnant or breastfeeding mother are unknown at this time because there is not enough data. A small group of women who participated in the vaccine trials and 6 Vaccin ation Considerations for People who are Pregnant or Breastfeeding | CDC 14 were vaccinated became pregnant and have not experienced adverse effects to th emselves or the baby. This is too small of a sample size to fully know the impact of the vaccines, but so far there is no evidence that suggests the vaccine can cause miscarriage or birth defects. Several studies are currently underway, and it is expected that more information on vaccine in pregnancy in the near future. It is important to note that according to the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, pregnant individuals are more likely to have higher risk of severe illness associated with COVID -19 infection, such as ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and death. Also, pregnant women with COVID -19 might be at increased risk for other adverse outcomes, such as premature delivery. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding and have concerns about the COVID -19 vaccine, you should discuss them with your doctor. Our last question for review today is: Does the vaccine impact fertility? There is no known link between the vaccine and infertility in females or males. o Six women in the Moderna vaccine clinical trial and 12 in the Pfizer trial became pregnant after being vaccinated. This is the same pregnancy rate as those who received the placebo (fake vaccine) in the trials. o Earlier in 2021, the Society for Male Reproduction and the Society for the Study of Male Reproduction recommended that men, including men who were planning to conceive, should be encouraged to receive the COVID -19 vaccination. 7 Huddle Wrap -Up ASK: What is your best action if you are pregnant or breastfeeding and are unsure about receiving the COVID -19 vaccine? (Talk with your doctor to discuss your risks for getting COVID -19.) SAY: Being aware of the risks to your unborn or newborn child is crit ical in making the right decision for you. If you have questions you would like addressed privately, please speak with me or your manager.

Identify how and where staff can post questions and review the resources you share during this huddle. Be prepared to give them directions. Anticipated time to present Module 5: 10 minutes Conduct the Huddle SAY: Today we will discuss some questions and concerns related to testing after vaccine, post -COVID -19 illness , tracking devices , and ongoing COVID -19 precautions post-vaccine . First, let's check in on our vaccination status: Our goal for staff vaccines is ___% and we are currently at ___% Our next vaccination date is: ______________________. Our first question for review today is: Will I test positive for COVID -19 after I get the vaccine? No, the current COVID -19 vaccines wil l not cause you to test positive for COVID -19. Once you are vaccinated, there still is a chance you can contract COVID -19 and test positive as a result, but experts believe that being fully vaccinated may help keep you from getting seriously ill. Your body needs time to respond to the vaccine and build up antibodies that fight the virus. It typically takes 2 weeks to build up protection/immunity against COVID -19 after receiving the final vaccine. If you are 2 weeks past your last vaccine and are exposed to COVID -19, you will not have to quarantine as long as you have no symptoms. At this time, vaccinated persons should continue masking, social distancing, and hand washing to protect themselves and others.8 Our next question for review today is: I already had COVID and recovered, do I need to get vaccinated? Due to the severe health risks associated with COVID -19 and the fact that re- infection with COVID -19 is possible, you should consider getting the vaccine even if you have already had COVID -19. Right now, we do not know if we will need to be vaccinated each year or if this first round of vaccines will continue to be effective after a few months. o Example: Hepatitis vaccines are completed in a series and may need a booster, but flu vaccination is annual. Other vaccines require boosters, like measles and tetanus. Our last question for review today is: Does the COVID -19 vaccine have a tracking chi p inside of it? There are no tracking mechanisms inside of a COVID -19 vaccine. This type of technology does not exist for the COVID -19 vaccine or any vaccine. 8 Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of mRNA COVID -19 Vaccines | CDC 16 ASK: Once you get the COVID -19 vaccine, do you still need to maintain COVID -19 precautions ? Why or why not? DO: Refer to the CDC \"Slow the Spread\" poster to reinforce the need for staff to take ongoing COVID -19 precautions. SAY: While the vaccine may prevent you from having symptoms if you get COVID -19, it is not yet known whether you can carry and transmit the virus to others. Currently, the CDC recommends that during the pandemic, everyone continue to continue to wear a mask , wash their hands, s ocial distance, and stay home when sick. Huddle Wrap -Up ASK: What facts have you learned from our discussion today? SAY: If you have questions you would like addressed privately, please speak with me or your manager.

Additional Facilitator Resources for Module 5 CDC Facts about COVID -19 Vaccines CDC Benefits of Getting a COVID -19 Vaccine 17 Module 6 Wrap -Up and Review/Reward Activity (Upon Completion of Modules 1- 5) Objective: For facility leaders to engage staff through rounding and evaluate their knowledge of the COVID -19 vaccine . This allows leaders to identify unanswered questions or mis conceptions that are causing staf f to feel hesitant about receiv ing the COVID -19 vaccine. Facilitator Preparation Determ ine rounding schedule, include all shifts and weekends. Gather tools for rounding: o Two baskets - one for questions, one for rewards (e.g., small candy, non- sugar snacks, fun pens, etc.). o Print the list of questions (see questions at the end of Module 6) f or staff related to the COVID -19 facts presented during Modules 1- 5. Cut the questions into individual pieces of paper and place in one basket. NOTE: Use the questions that are most relevant to your facility. Add questions as needed to address other reasons for your staff's vaccine hesitancy. o Print the answer key for the questions (see key at the end of Module 6). o Attach a small notepad and pen to one basket for leaders to write down new concerns or questions for follow -up. Hold a meeting with the leader s who will round. o Review each staff question and the answer key. o Review your current vaccination process. o Define your facility's procedure for rounding (e.g., assignments to units and departments, timing, target number of staff to engage, etc.) Recommend ations for Vaccine Rounding At assigned timeframes, designated leaders obtain the questions and reward baskets to begin rounds. Leaders will ask a staff member to pull a question from the basket and read the question out loud. If the staff seems uncomfor table reading, the leader may read the question. The staff member who selects the question will be the first to attempt to answer. If the staff member is unable to answer the question, this is a great time to engage them and provide a better understanding. Give others who have gathered an opportunity to answer. Inability to answer the question is not punitive. Discussion ensues so the answer is provided. o If time allows, invite others who have gathered choose a question. Answer the questions as a group for more reinforcement of topics and then have everyone select from the reward basket. o All staff may participate, even if they have received the vaccine, as they may be able to share the story of why they decided to get the vaccine. o Be sure to ask if they have any ongoing questions or concerns that need to be reviewed. Write new questions on the pad and return it to the facilitator. The facilitator will follow up on all new questions and post answers in the designated area(s) where other questions and information from the modules have been posted. 18 Printable Questions for COVID -19 Vaccine Rounding - Module 6 1.

The COVID vaccine contains a live virus, so there is a risk that it will make me sick. a. True b. False - The messenger RNA cells in the vaccine are man- made a nd foreign to our systems, so they trigger our body to make antibodies. These antibodies provide us immunity so you will be ready to respond if you are exposed to COVID -19. These messenger cells are only in your system in about 2 days. 2. The most common side effect from the COVID vaccine is _________________ a. Soreness at injection site. b. Body aches. c. Fever. d. Shortness of breath. 3. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, you cannot get the vaccination. a. True b. False - If you are uncomfortable with receiving the vaccine, speak with your physician to determine your risks. The risks of complications if you contract COVID -19 during pregnancy are concerning. Your doctor can help you make the right decision for you. 4. I already had COVID, so I do not need the vaccine because I have immunity. a. True b. False - Scientists are still gathering data, but natural immunity to having COVID -19 is inconsistent depending on how severe your illness was and it appears to diminish after 90 days. You can feel comfortable waiting 90 days to receive your vaccine after you test positive for COVID -19, but you can still become infected again and get sick. 5. Why are some populations at higher risk for COVID -19? a. Environmental: Larger numbers of people in one home; many of those living in a small home, work in high -risk jobs (direct contact with public); front line health care workers, support staff for public place s (housekeeping, bus drivers, grocery workers, etc.) b. Health care availability: insurance, work during office hours, health care not affordable. c. Comorbidities: high blood pressure, heart disease, sickle cell, respiratory conditions like asthma and COPD. a. All answers listed above are correct. 6. African Americans, Hispanics and Latinos, and Native Americans ARE/ARE NOT at higher risk for side effects from the COVID -19 vaccine: a. Are b. Are not - Clinical trials for both mRNA vaccines included African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans. For example, Moderna reported 30% of trial participants represented these populations and Pfizer reported 42% of its participants did. No increased side eff ects were noted. 22 7. List 3 ways to reduce risk of COVID -19 even after vaccination: a. All answers are correct - Masking, 6- foot social distancing, hand hygiene, stay home when sick, avoid public places, avoid large gatherings. 8. Why was the United States able to safely approve the new COVID -19 vaccines so quickly? a. The new vaccines were based on vaccines for other coronaviruses, which helped speed up their development. b. Clinical trials, which only require 3,000 people, were completed with 30,000 to 50,000 parti cipants with minimal side effects and no deaths. c. No steps were skipped. d. All answers listed above are correct. 9. Which is NOT a common side effect from COVID -19 vaccines? a. Body aches b. Fever for 24- 28 hours c. Loss of taste or smell - Loss of taste or smell is specific to COVID -19 infection. If these symptoms occur, quarantine and call you doctor to see if you should be tested. d. Soreness at injection site 10. Once I get the COVID -19 vaccine I will: a. Not have to be tested anymore - After vaccination and ful l immunity, you can still get infected with COVID. You will just have mild or no symptoms, so you may not even know you are sick. CDC is currently not sure how contagious immunized people will be, so it is important to continue testing to reduce the spre ad and quarantining to protect other people, including our residents. b. Always test positive - You will not test positive after vaccination unless you have an active COVID -19 infection. c. Still need to be tested as all other staff - The vaccine eliminates or reduces the symptoms of COVID -19; you may have an infection and not kn ow it. d. None of the above. 11. It takes ___ weeks to build up protection/immunity against COVID -19 active virus. a. 2 days b. 2 weeks - Your body needs time to respond to the vaccine and build up antibodies that fight the virus. Immunity is obtained 2 weeks after your final vaccine. c. 3 weeks d. 4 weeks 12. COVID -19 vaccines do not alter my DNA. a. True - Some of the COVID -19 vaccines use messenger RNA cells that teach our cells how to make a protein that triggers a safe, natural immune response. The messenger cells never enter the nucleus (the brains of the cell) where our DNA is. Other COVID -19 vaccines are viral vector vaccines, which contain pieces of protein that the body sees as a foreign body. This triggers the production of antibodies that will respond to COVID -19 infection quickly. Both the messenger and viral vector vaccines do not affect or interact with our DNA in any way. b. False AHRQ Pub No. 21-00 20-1-EF March 2021 www.ahrq.gov 13. Once I get the vaccine, I will not have to wear a mask in public anymore. a. True b.
