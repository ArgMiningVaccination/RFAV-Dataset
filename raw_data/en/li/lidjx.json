Patients with HIV with negative anti-HBs, anti-HBc, and HBsAg test results have no evidence of immunity and should be offered vaccination against HBV [ [DHHS 2022](#nycghepb.REF25)]; see and . Conversely, patients with positive anti-HBc and anti-HBs test results have resolved HBV infection and do not require vaccination. Primary Vaccination Strategies The single-antigen HBV vaccines currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for individuals 18 years old are Engerix-B, Recombivax HB, and Heplisav-B. Prehevbrio, a new 3-antigen recombinant HBV vaccine, was approved in 2021 by the FDA for use for individuals 18 years old [ [FDA 2021](#nycghepb.REF34)], but experience regarding its use in patients with HIV is lacking at this time. The level of immune response to HBV vaccination in individuals with HIV can be lower than in adults who are HIV seronegative [ [Mast, et al. 1994](#nycghepb.REF.tayal.1994.558); [Loke, et al. 1990](#nycghepb.REF.loke.1990.109)]. Many studies have shown that the presence of detectable HIV RNA [ [Overton, et al. 2005](#nycghepb.REF.overton.2005.1045); [Tedaldi, et al. 2004](#nycghepb.REF.tedaldi.2004.1478)] and low CD4 cell counts [Veiga, et al. [Fonseca, et 2005](#nycghepb.REF.fonseca.2005.2902); [Tedaldi, et al. 2004](#nycghepb.REF.tedaldi.2004.1478); [Keet, et al. 1992](#nycghepb.REF.keet.1992.509)] correlates with a poor immune response to vaccination. Ideally, based on the data, the HBV vaccine should be administered before a patient's CD4 count declines to <350 cells/mm3 to improve immunogenicity; however, vaccination should not be deferred in patients who have CD4 counts <350 cells/mm3. The initial vaccine series using conventional HBV vaccines (Engerix-B, Recombivax HB) is typically administered intramuscularly as 3 standard doses at 0, 4, and 24 weeks (see , below). Whether patients with HIV should receive a standard or double dose of these vaccines is still being debated. This Committee and the [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV](https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines/hiv-clinical-guidelines-adult-and-adolescent-opportunistic-infections/hepatitis-b-0?view=full) recommend administering the standard 3-dose regimen. If the patient does not respond, a higher dose can be administered when the patient is revaccinated [ [DHHS 2022](#nycghepb.REF25)]. Heplisav-B, a 2-dose (4 weeks apart) recombinant HBsAg vaccine with a novel adjuvant, is also available for individuals 18 years old [ [FDA 2020](#nycghepb.REF33)]. In 3 randomized controlled trials among individuals without HIV, administration of 2 doses of Heplisav-B was associated with a higher seroprotection rate than 3 doses of Engerix-B [ [FDA 2020](#nycghepb.REF33)]. A recent retrospective cohort study among individuals with HIV found seroprotection rates were increased with the Heplisav-B vaccine compared with other previously used HBV vaccines [ [Schnittman, et al. 2021](#nycghepb.REF.schnittman.2021.445)]. In addition, a recent modeling study determined that use of Heplisav-B among individuals with HIV results in lower costs and increased benefits compared with Engerix-B [ [Rosenthal, et al. 2020](#nycghepb.REF.rosenthal.2020.8206)]. A 2-dose series may increase adherence because it requires fewer follow-up visits and a shorter wait time between doses than the 3-dose vaccines. No data are available to support use of other recombinant vaccines for the second dose if Heplisav-B is used for the initial dose. Combined HBV and hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccine: Twinrix is a combination vaccine that includes recombinant HBV and HAV vaccines; it is approved by the FDA for use in individuals 18 years old in the United States. For individuals with HIV who are not immune to both HAV and HBV, Twinrix may be administered as an initial series and administered in 3 doses at 0, 4, and 24 weeks. No data are available to support the administration of this vaccine as a double-dose or 4-dose series, so these strategies are not recommended in patients with HIV.

Double dosing with Recombivax HB has not been as well studied as double dosing with Engerix-B. However, Recombivax HB may be the only formulation available at some institutions. c. Double dosing and an accelerated schedule with Heplisav-B have not been well studied. d. Double dosing and use of a 4-dose series with Twinrix have not been well studied in patients with HIV and are not recommended. Double-dose and 4-dose strategies: Other vaccination approaches are to administer a double dose of vaccine on a standard 3-dose schedule or to add a fourth dose at 2 months to a 3-dose vaccine series. Several studies have shown improved immune response to double-dose vaccinations given in a 3-dose schedule [ [de Vries-Sluijs, 2008](#nycghepb.REF.de_vriessluijs.2008.292); al. 2005](#nycghepb.REF.fonseca.2005.2902)]. A 2013 meta-analysis (5 studies, n=883) found that increasing the vaccine dosage may significantly improve immune responses in participants with HIV [ [Ni, et al. 2013](#nycghepb.REF.ni.2013.117)]. A 2015 multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT) (20 g) with double-dose (40 g) HBV revaccination in adults who did not respond to primary vaccination [ [Rey, et al. 2015](#nycghepb.REF.rey.2015.1283)]. In this study, double-dose revaccination was not associated with a higher response rate than revaccination with a standard single-dose regimen at week 4 after vaccination. However, the proportion who responded to the vaccine and the geometric mean titers at week 4 after vaccination were higher in the double-dose group than in the standard-dose group. Seroprotective responses at week 72 were greater in the double-dose group than in the standard-dose group. The safety profile was similar between the groups [ [Rey, et al. 2015](#nycghepb.REF.rey.2015.1283)]. An RCT conducted in 2013 compared the immunogenicity and safety of 4 standard doses and 4 double doses with 3 standard doses of HBV vaccination in adults with HIV [ [Chaiklang, et al. 2013](#nycghepb.REF.chaiklang.2013.e80409)]. Response rates were higher in the 4-dose group than in the standard 3-dose group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Local adverse effects were more common with increased frequency and dosage of vaccine, but systemic and serious adverse effects were extremely rare [ [Chaiklang, et al. 2013](#nycghepb.REF.chaiklang.2013.e80409)]. Based on these data, it is reasonable to consider an alternative primary HBV vaccination approach with a 3- or 4-injection double-dose vaccine series in patients with HIV. Accelerated vaccination: An RCT using the standard-dose HBV vaccine compared an accelerated schedule (0, 1, and 3 weeks) with the standard schedule (0, 4, and 24 weeks) and demonstrated a noninferior response rate for participants with CD4 counts >500 cells/mm3; this schedule may increase patient adherence to the full vaccine series [ [de Vries-Sluijs, et al. 2011](#nycghepb.REF.de_vriessluijs.2011.984)]. However, the accelerated schedule was inferior in patients with CD4 counts of 200 to 500 cells/mm3. Because of the low number of participants with CD4 counts <200 cells/mm3, the results were inconclusive for this population. Based on these findings, the accelerated schedule may be considered for patients with CD4 counts 500 cells/mm3 but is not recommended for patients with CD4 counts <500 cells/mm3 [ [de Vries-Sluijs, et al. 2011](#nycghepb.REF.de_vriessluijs.2011.984)]. If an accelerated HBV vaccination schedule is used, the patient should also receive a fourth-dose booster at least 6 months after initiation of the vaccine series. Pregnancy: Clinicians should not defer initial vaccination or revaccination in pregnant patients with HIV who do not have immunity to HBV. There are no well-controlled studies designed to evaluate the recommended anti-HBV vaccines during pregnancy. However, available data do not suggest an increased risk of miscarriage or major congenital disabilities in individuals who received Engerix-B, Twinrix, Recombivax HB, or Heplisav-B vaccines during pregnancy compared with individuals in the general U.S. population who were not vaccinated during pregnancy [ [FDA 2020](#nycghepb.REF33), [2018a](#nycghepb.REF30), [2018b](#nycghepb.REF31), [2018c](#nycghepb.REF32)]. anti-HBs, and positive anti-HBc test results, isolated anti-HBc positivity has been reported in 0.4% to 1.7% of blood donors in low prevalence areas and 10% to 20% of the population in endemic countries [ [Lok, et al. 1988](#nycghepb.REF.lok.1988.766)]. It has been estimated that 17% to 41% of patients with HIV have isolated anti-HBc positivity [ [Bhattacharya, et al. 2016](#nycghepb.REF.bhattacharya.2016.e14); [Witt, et [Neau, et al. 2005](#nycghepb.REF.neau.2005.750)]. As shown in , there are 4 possible interpretations of this result: resolved HBV infection with waning anti-HBs titers, false-positive result, HBV infection, or resolving acute HBV infection [ [Mast, et al. 2006](#nycghepb.REF.mast.2006)]. Most patients with HIV and isolated anti-HBc positivity are HBV DNA-negative, not immune to HBV [ [Gandhi, et al. 2005](#nycghepb.REF.gandhi.2005.1435)], and routinely checking HBV DNA is no longer recommended. Clinicians should offer patients with HIV and isolated anti-HBc a single standard dose of HBV vaccine [ [DHHS 2022](#nycghepb.REF25)]. Anti-HBs testing should be performed 8 weeks after the first dose. If the anti-HBs titer is <100 mIU/mL, the remaining vaccines in the series should be administered, and anti-HBs testing should be repeated 8 weeks after the vaccine series is complete [ [DHHS 2022](#nycghepb.REF25); [Piroth, et al. 2016](#nycghepb.REF.piroth.2016.1735)]. In a prospective study of 54 patients with HIV and isolated anti-HBc, 46% responded to a single dose of vaccine. Of those who did not respond to a single dose, 89% developed immunity after a 3-dose series of double-dose vaccine [ [Piroth, et al. 2016](#nycghepb.REF.piroth.2016.1735)]. For patients with an anti-HBs titer 100 mIU/mL, clinicians may opt to discontinue the vaccine series. There are few data to guide the optimal number of vaccine doses for these patients but no evidence of harm in completing the full vaccination series. However, if patients with HIV and isolated anti-HBc refuse vaccination or if post-vaccination anti-HBs testing cannot be assured, then a reasonable approach is to perform HBV DNA testing [ [Chang, et al. 2018](#nycghepb.REF.chang.2018.172)]. HBV DNA testing may also be performed in patients with isolated anti-HBc who do not respond to the full vaccine series. A positive HBV DNA test result in a patient with isolated anti-HBc test results indicates occult HBV infection (see the guideline section [HBV Screening and "}
