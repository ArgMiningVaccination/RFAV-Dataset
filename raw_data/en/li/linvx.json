The CHART Model will test whether aligned financial incentives, increased operational flexibility, and robust technical support promote rural health care providers' capacity to implement effective health care delivery system red esign on a broad scale. The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) will evaluate the impact of the CHART Model on Medicare and Medicaid expenditures, access to care, quality of care, and health outcomes for rural residents . CHART aligns with CMS' s Rethinking Rural Health initiative, which aims to ensure individuals in rural America have access to high quality, affordable health care by offering new and creative payment models.1 The CHART Model will include two tracks : 1) the Community Transformation Track and 2) the Accountable Care Organization (ACO) Transformation Track. This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is for the Community Transformation Track only. Under the Community Transformation Track, award recipients will receive cooperative agre ement funding and a programmatic framework to assess the needs of their Community (as defined in sectio n A.4.3.1. Community Definition below ) and implement health care delivery system redesign . Hospitals participating in the Community Transformation Track Alternative Payment Model (APM) will receive capitated payments. Capitated payments provide hospitals with a stable revenue stream and incentivize reductions in fixed costs and avoidable utilization.2 Operational flexibilities will be available for participating hospitals to relieve regulatory burden, emphasize high -value services, and support providers in care management for their beneficiaries . Under the ACO Transformation Track , entities will receive upfront payments to establish or expand rural ACOs that participate in two -sided risk arrangements through the Medicar e Shared Savings Program. Building on the success of the ACO Investment Model (AIM), these upfront payments will help rural entities engage in value -based payment reform and support the participation of such rural ACOs in the Medicare Shared Savings Progra m, several tracks of which are Advanced Alternative Payment Models (Advanced APMs) for 2020 . Information for the ACO Transformation Track will be released at a later date to be specified by CMMI. The ACO Transformation Track is separate from the Community Transformation Track and is not addressed in this NOFO. Award recipients' (herein referred to as \"Lead Organizations\") participation in the Community Transformation Track of the CHART Model will begin with a Pre -Implementation Period (15 months ), during w hich they will recruit participating hospitals (herein referred to as \"Participant Hospitals\" in accordance with section A.4.4.2. Participant Hospitals ) and partner with them and other community stakeholders to develop a health care delivery system redesign strategy. Following the Pre -Implementation Period, Lead Organizations, community stakeholders, and 6 Participant Hospitals will have 6 Performance Peri ods (6 years) to implement their health care delivery system redesign strategy and participate in the APM .

Program Description A.1. Purpose The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), through its Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), will implement a new Model, the Community Health Access and Rural Transformation (CHART) Model. The CHART Model aims to improve health care quality and reduce Medicare and Medicaid expenditure s within rural communities. The CHART Model will harness the drive, creativity, and local expert ise of rural communities and leverage national resources to improve access to care, quality of care, and health outcomes for rural residents . CHART's Community Transformation Track aims to catalyze modernization of rural health delivery systems by offering technical support, operational flexibilities, and an APM specifically designed for rural communities. A.2. Authority to Test the Model The authority for the CHART Model is section 1115A of the Social Security Act (the Act). Section 1115A of the Act authorizes the Secretary of the Department of Health a nd Human Services (HHS) to test innovative payme nt and service delivery models to reduce Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP expenditures while preserving or enhancing the quality of beneficiaries' care. A.3. Background Rural hospitals face significant barriers to maintaining financial stability , including low patient volumes and high average fixed costs , that undermine viability under traditional health care reimbursement mechanisms such as volume -based Fee for Service (FFS) . Additionally, rural hospitals have more difficulty attracting and retaining a health care workforce.3 - 4 A volume -based Fee for Service (FFS) payment structure can exacerbate the adverse conditions experienced by rural health care systems. Under FFS, if volumes decline, the continuation of high -cost but essential service lines, such as obstetrics, gynecology, and cancer care, can become financially unviable. Stakeholders have shared that existing regulatory con straints can drive rural hospitals' to maintain inefficient facility footprints.5 In Medicare, APMs and Advanced APMs have accelerated the reduction of health care costs and improved quality of care.6 However, rural health care providers have adopted Advanced APMs at lower rates compared to urban health care providers due to perceived issues in capacity for implementation and lack of flexibility for rural practices .7 To mitigate the barriers rural hospitals face when implementing health care transformation, the Community Transformation Track of the CHART Model offers (1) funding to establish partnerships and technical support, (2) an APM specifically designed for the rural context, and (3) operational flexibilities . Through the CHA RT Model, health care providers, as well as public 9 and private payers, can collectively invest in increasing access to care, promoting quality, and improving the health outcomes of residents within their Community . A.4. Program Requirements A.4.1. Key Te rms TERM DEFINITION Acute Care Hospital A hospital that provides inpatient medical care and other related services for surgery, acute medical conditions, or injuries (usually for a short -term illness or condition). Advanced Alternative Payment Model (Advanced APM) As set forth in 42 CFR 414.1305, Advanced APMs are APMs that meet the following three criteria (which are specified in 42 CFR 414.1415): 1. Require participants to use certified EHR technology 2. Provide payment for covered professional services b ased on quality measures comparable to those used in the MIPS quality performance category; and 3. Either: (1) is a Medical Home Model expanded under CMMI authority or (2) requires a participant to bear more than a nominal amount of financial risk Advisory C ouncil * The Advisory Council is a multi -stakeholder organization that will play an advisory role to the Lead Organization as they carry out their funded activities ( Table 2. Funded Activities for Lead Organizations ), such as providing critical feedback in the development and implementation of Transformation Plans and assistance with collaboration efforts with Participant Hospitals, the State Medicaid Age ncy (SMA), and other key Community stakeholders. Aligned Payer * An Aligned Payer is an entity that makes payment for health care services and possesses the three aligning characteristics outlined in Table 5. Medicaid Participation Targets . Alternative Payment Model (APM) For purposes of this NOFO, an Alternative Payment Model (APM) is a payment approach that gives 10 TERM DEFINITION added incentive payments to provide high quality and cost- efficient care. APMs can apply to a specific clinical condition, a care episode, or a population. For purposes of the Quality Payment Program, APM is codified in 42 C.F.R. 414.1305. Capitated Payment Amount (CPA) Capitated payment amount is the prospectively set annual payment amount for a Participant Hospital for Eligible Hospital Services that the Participant Hospital furnishes . The CPA will be calculated by CMMI. Collaborative Governance Collaborative governanc e refers to the approach of collaboration at the community level that involves shared leadership of rural hospitals and other health care providers ( e.g., FQHCs) via governance arrangements ( e.g., overlapping council constituents) and possibly shared manag ement, to support cooperation in sharing and/or coordinating resources within a geographic region. Community * Community is a geographic area that meets the requirements in section A.4.3.1. Community Definition . Community Transformation Track * The Community Transformation Track includes the following: cooperative agreement funding, operational flexibilities, and the Community Transformation Track APM, which prospectively sets an annual payment amount for a defined set of Eligible Hospital Services for Participant Hospitals.8 Critical Access Hospital (CAH) A state that has established a Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program may designate certain facilities as Critical Access Hospitals (CAH). CMS will then certify a state -designated facility as a CAH if the facility meets certain requirements. CAHs receive cost -based reimbursement for most Medicare Part A and Part B services. Eligible hospi tals must, among other requirements, meet the following conditions to obtain CAH designation: 1. Have 25 or fewer acute care inpatient beds 2. Be located more than 35 miles from another hospital or CAH or 15 miles if mountainous 11 TERM DEFINITION terrain with only secondary roads (some exceptions apply) 3. Maintain an annual average length of stay of 96 hours or less for acute care patients 4. Provide 24/7 emergency care services CAHs are defined in section 1861(mm)(1) of the Social Security Act. Discount Factor * Discount factor refer s to the small percentage discount applied to the capitated payment amount (CPA). The specific discount factor for a Community is determined by its total Medicare FFS revenue under the capitated payment arrangement at the Community -level , as specified in Appendix XI. CPA Financial Methodology. Eligible Hospital Service An Eligible Hospital Service is any health care service that meets the following criteria: 1. Is covered under Part A or Part B of Title XVIII of the Act; 2. Meets the Service Inclusion Criteria discussed in section A.4.5.1. Capitated Payment ; and 3. Does not meet the Service Exclusion Criteria discussed in section A.4.5.1. Capitated Payment . Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) Federally Qualif ied Health Center (FQHC) status is a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) designation indicating eligibility for reimbursement using specific payment methodologies. Federally Qualified Health Center is defined in sections 1861(aa)(4) and 1905(l )(2)(B) of the Act. The types of FQHCs include: 1. Health Center Program award recipients that receive federal funding under section 330 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act and entities receiving funding from such a grant as a subrecipicent of the Health C enter Program award recipient. 2. Health Center Program look -alikes. Look -alikes do not receive federal funding under section 330 of the PHS Act; however, to receive look - alike designation and associated Federal 12 TERM DEFINITION benefits, look -alikes must meet the Health Cent er Program requirements. 3. Outpatient health programs or facilities operated by a Tribe or Tribal/Indian organization under the Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act (Public Law 93 -638) or by an urban Indian organization receiving funds under title V of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act for the provision of primary health services. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) administers grant funding (as applicable) and oversight of the first two types of FQHCs (Health Cente r Program award recipients and look - alikes), both of which must meet a stringent set of requirements. These requirements are detailed in the Health Center Program Compliance Manual available.9 Hub-and-Spoke Model Hub-and-Spoke is a model of care that arranges service delivery assets into a network consisting of an anchor establishment (hub) that offers a full array of services, which is complemented by secondary establishments (spokes) which offer more limited service arrays. Patients who need more int ensive services are routed from a spoke to a hub.10 Lead Organization * A Lead Organization is a CHART Model award recipient under the Community Transformation Track. It is responsible for forming the Advisory Council, recruiting Participant Hospitals, eng aging the SMA, developing and implementing the Transformation Plan, and overseeing the implementation of the Community Transformation Track APM. There can only be one Lead Organization per Community. See section A.4.3 Lead Organization and the Community . Participant Hospital * A Participant Hospital is an acute care hospital (defined as a \"subsection (d) hospital\" in section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act) or CAH that meets the 13 TERM DEFINITION requirements in section A.4.4.2. Participant Hospitals . Payer A Payer is an entity furnishing payments for health care services. Rural Health Clinic (RHC) A Rural Health Clinic (RHC) is a clinic located in a rural, medically under- served area in the United States that has a separate reimbursement structure from the standard medical office under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The RHC program is intended to increase access to primary care services for patients in rural communities. RHCs can be public, nonp rofit, or for- profit health care facilities. To receive certification, they must be located in rural, underserved areas. They are required to use a team approach of physicians working with non -physician health care providers such as nurse practitioners (NP ), physician assistants (PA), and certified nurse midwives (CNM) to provide services. The clinic must be staffed at least 50% of the time with a NP, PA, or CNM. RHCs are required to provide outpatient primary care services and basic laboratory services. De finitions are set out at sections 1861(aa)(2) and 1905(L)(1) of the Act. Subrecipient According to 2 CFR \u00a7 200.93, subrecipient means a non-Federal entity that receives a subaward from a pass- through entity to carry out part of a Federal program; but does not include an individual that is a beneficiary of such program. A subrecipient may also be a recipient of other Federal awards directly from a Federal awarding agency. Transformation Plan * A Transformation Plan is a detailed description of the health care delivery system redesign strategy that will be carried out under the Community Transformation Track of the CHART Model. Transformation Plan requirements are outlined in section A.4.3.2. Transformation Plan . *Key terms marked with an asterisk are specific to the CHART Model 14 A.4.2. Model Design and Funding Structure Understanding that rural communities face unique challenges to implementing healt h care delivery system redesign, the Community Transformation Track of the CHART Model consists of three core program elements designed to set up rural communities for success. 1. Funding to establish partnerships and technical support. The Community Transformation Track of the CHART Model will provide Lead Organizations with cooperative agreement funding to implement health care delivery system redesign that is both evidence informed and tailored to the Community's needs. Lead Organizations will be ab le to use cooperative agreement funding to establish partnerships with community stakeholders to develop a health care delivery system redesign strategy, recruit Participant Hospitals, and procure technical support. 2. Operational flexibilities. The CHART Mod el makes operational flexibilities available to support Communities in implementing health care delivery system redesign. Participant Hospitals may leverage operational flexibilities in their Community to relieve regulatory burden, emphasize high- value services, and support providers in care management for their beneficiaries. Operational flexibilities will be made available through a combination of model design elements and waivers under section 1115A authority as necessary to test the Model. 3. Value -based payment . Participant Hospitals will receive capitated payments. This stable revenue stream will incentivize Participant Hospitals to lower fixed costs, reduce potentially avoidable utilization, and improve quality of care. The Community Transformation Track of the CHART Model will begin with a Pre - Implementation Period , during which a Lead Organization will collaborate with key participants and community stakeholders to develop a strategy to implement health care delivery system redesign (as described in section A.4.3.2. Transformation Plan). In total, Lead Organizations will have six Performance Periods to implement their Transformation Plan. The Lead Organization will receive up to $5M in cooperative agreement funding. All cooperative agreement funding will be tied to performance requirements. The funding amounts, prerequisites, Budget Periods, and Performance Periods are outlined in Table 1. Funding Timeline and Prerequisites below. Table 2. Funded Activities for Lead Organizations in section A.4.3 Lead Organization and the Community describes the activities for which L ead Organizations are expected to use Model funds. To receive funding for the Second Budget Period through the Seventh Budget Period, Lead Organizations must submit a non- competing continuation application. Additional instructions will be included in the terms and condition s of the cooperative agreement. 15 Table 1.

The Lead Organization will be responsible for driving health care delivery system redesign by leading the development and im plementation of Transformation Plans as well as convening and engaging the Advisory Council. Lead Organizations will also be responsible for ensuring compliance with Model requirements and with any requests from CMMI for additional data or other supplemental information. A potential Lead Organization must submit, as part of its application, documentation that demonstrates it meets each of the following requirements for selection: 1. A presence in the Community one year prior to the publication date of this NOF O. Examples of \"presence\" include advocating for (e.g., a representative organization) , providing services to, or otherwise serving beneficiaries within the Community). While a physical presence in the Community is not required, a relationship with the Com munity is required . 2. Expertise in rural health issues, in particular specific diseases, health disparities, barriers to accessing care, policy, and other key factors that significantly influence health outcomes , particularly those prevalent in the Community . 3. Experience, either through direct management or through a partnership, in designing and implementing APMs. 4. Received and successfully managed one or several health -related grant(s) or cooperative agreement(s) totaling at least $500,000 over the last thre e years. 5. Experience in each of the following areas: a. Engaging and maintaining provider participation in APMs or CMMI demonstration projects/models. b. Establishing, modifying as needed, and maintaining agreements between health care providers. 19 c. Conducting outreach, developing, and managing relationships with diverse health care -related stakeholders. Any organization that does not meet all of the criteria listed above is ineligible to serve as a Lead Organization. Examples of entities eligible to serve as Le ad Organizations include, but are not limited to, State Medicaid Agencies (SMAs), State Offices of Rural Health (SORHs), local public health departments, Independent Practice Associations (IPAs), and Ac ademic Medical Centers (AMCs). A.4.3.1. Community Def inition Lead Organizations will be responsible for defining the parameters of their Community, for the purposes of the CHART Model. Each Community must meet the following criteria: 1. Encompass either (a) a single county or census tract or (b) a set of contig uous or non- contiguous counties or census tracts. Each county or census tract must be classified as rural, as defined by the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy's list of eligible counties and census tracts used for its grant programs .11 2. At the time of a pplication submission, include a minimum of 10,000 Medicare FFS beneficiaries whose primary residence is within the Community. NOTE: Lead Organization's definition of their Community is subject to CMMI review and approval. During application review, CMMI will ensure that there is not overlap between Lead Organizations ' defined Communities. A.4.3.2. Transformation Plan Lead Organizations will leverage technical support and input from Community Partners, i.e. its Advisory Council, Participant Hospitals, and the SMA as described in section A.4.4. Community Partners , to design and implement Transformation Plans that are both tailored to the Community's needs and informed by best practices. Transformation Plans are Lead Organizations' descriptions of their health care delivery system redesign strategy. Each Lead Organization, in collaboration with its Advisory Council (including the SMA) and its Participant Hospitals, will develop and submit Transformation Plans . All Transformation Plans must be reviewed and approved by CMMI . A Lead Organization will submit their first Transformation Plan during the Pre -Implementation Period, and subsequently submit updates o n an annual basis. At a minimum, CMMI will review each Transformation Plan prior to the start of each Performance Period and provide feedback to the Lead Organization as necessary leading up to Transformation Plan approval. A Lead Organization may modify its Transformation Plan more frequently than the schedule set by CMMI, for example if they want 20 to implement a programmatic change on a more immediate basis . Upon CMMI approval, each Lead Organization must begin implement ing its Transformation Plan in Perfo rmance Period 1. CMMI requires Transformation Plans to focus on population health disparities present in the Community . Specifically, Transformation Plans must address at least one of the following: behavioral health treatment, substance use disorder treatment, chronic disease management and prevention, or maternal and infant health. CMMI also requires Transformation Plans to include strategies to expand the use of telehealth and other technology to support care delivery improvement. Communities may le verage regulatory flexibilities under the Model to implement telehealth expansion in regards to Section 1834(m) of the Act . In addition, Communities are encouraged to address social determinants of health in their Transformation Plans . To address the socia l determinants of health, Lead Organizations may utilize cooperative agreement funding, leverage the transportation Medicare beneficiary engagement incentive ( see section A.4.6. Operational Flexibilities under the Model ) or engage the SMA to implement a change in Medicaid policy . More information on integrating social determinants within health care delivery system redesign will be made available to Commu nities that have been selected to participate. At CMMI's sole discretion and to the extent necessary to test the Model, certain waivers of Medicare and Medicaid requirements will be available to facilitate implementation of Transformation Plans (see sectio nA.4.6. Operational Flexibilities under the Model and Appendix IX. Medicaid Needs Assessment for more information) . For example, s ome Lead Organizations and/or Participant Hospitals may use such waivers to facilitate converting rural hospitals to rural emergency and outpatient -only fa cilities or establish hub- and-spoke arrangements that distribute and coordinate services by need throughout a Community. CMMI will use the Transformation Plans to track, monitor, and evaluate Lead Organizations' progress against the Model 's Community Transformation T rack goals. Cooperative agreement funding for each Performance Period is contingent on CMMI approval of Transformation Plans in budget periods 2 through 7 (see Table 1. Funding Timeline and Prerequisites ). Appendix X. Transformation Plan Requirements outlines the basic components of Transformation Plans. CMMI will provide additional guidance to Lead Organizations on Transformation Plan requirements upon award. A.4.3.3. Lead Organization Funded Activities Lead Organizations can use cooperative agreemen t funding for any of the purposes described in Table 2 below. The Lead Organization will be responsible for determining the budget allocations for staff time and infrastructure costs consistent with the Model terms and conditions, as well as demonstrating how they and their subrecipients will use funds to acco mplish their respective roles in Model implementation. The Lead Organization will be 21 responsible for the receipt and management of this funding in accordance with the Model terms and conditions and applicable federal laws. Additionally, Lead Organizations must demonstrate in their Transformation Plans, that Aligned Payers meet the requirements of the Model (for more information on Aligned Payers, see section A.4.5.3.

Lead Organizations may also use cooperative agreement funds for emergency response planning for future public health emergencies. Lead Organizations may request to receive less cooperative agreement funding in favor of a lower discount factor for their Participant Hospitals, as discussed in section A.4.5.1. Capitated Payment . A.4.4. Community Partners Recognizing that stakeholder engagement is key to effective reform, the Community Transformation track of the CHART Model requires that Lead Organizations establish an Advisory Council. Together the Lead Organization and their Advisory Council will forge robust and meaningful partnerships with their Participant Hospitals and SMA . 23 A.4.4.1. Advisory Council To ensure that heal th care delivery system redesign strategies reflect the Community's needs and goals, Lead Organizations are required to assemble an Advisory Council. The Advisory Council will represent the Community's perspective and collectively advise the Lead Organization as they carry out their required activities (described in Table 2. Funded Activities for Lead Organizations ). A few key activities the Advisory Council will advise on include, but are not limited to, developing and updating Transformation Plans, hospital and payer recruitment, developing arrangeme nts with payers governing APM alignment and data -sharing, monitoring the progress of the Model, and identifying any necessary changes. The Advisory Council will not manage the Lead Organization or Participant Hospitals. The Advisory Council will not be responsible for management and oversight of Cooperative Agreement funds. Lead Organizations must convene Advisory Councils at least quarterly. Advisory Councils should encompass a variety of perspectives and reflect the Community's needs. While the specific membership of the Advisory Council will differ by Community, it must include the following representatives: 1. The SMA (if the Lead Organization is not the SMA) even if the SMA is physically located outside of the Community. 2. At least one Participant Hospital (see section A.4.4.2. Participant Hospitals for definition). 3. At least one Aligned Payer (if the Lead Organization has recruited any commercial payers) see section A.4.5.3. Multi -payer Alignment for definition. 4. At least one beneficiary or unpaid caregiver. Furthermore, the Advisory Council must include a representative from at least three distinct entities from the following list: 1. A primary care provider, such as a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC), Rural Health Clinic (RHC), or physician group practice. 2. A health care provider of substance use disorder treatment and/or mental health services. 3. An additional Participant Hospital. 4. The State Office of Rural Health. 5. An additional Aligned Payer. 24 6. A community stakehol der group, such as a rural patient advocacy group, Area Agency on Aging, or faith - and community -based organizations. 7. A long -term care facility ( e.g., nursing home), home health provider, or hospice provider. 8. An Indian Health Service (IHS) or Tribal health provider or Federally recognized Tribe or Tribal organization. 9. The U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs (VA). The Lead Organization may include additional representatives from organizations or governmental entities not included in the list above. To be el igible to serve on the Advisory Council an organization must provide health care services, or services that address health - related social needs, to Community residents. An eligible governmental entity must have jurisdictions that encompass the Community's parameters. For example, Lead Organizations may consider inviting county governments, and state or local public health departments to join the Advisory Council. Individual Advisory Council representatives do not need to reside or work within the Community. However, each organization represented on the Advisory Council must have a presence within the Community or have a contractual arrangement with a health care provider that furnishes Eligible Hospital Services to beneficiaries living in the Community. For the purposes of this NOFO, any organization that advocates for, provides services to, or otherwise serves beneficiaries within a Community, is considered to have a presence within the Community. A.4.4.2. Participant Hospitals Lead Organizations will be expected to recruit Participant Hospitals for the Community Transformation Track APM. Each Participant Hospital, identified by its CMS Certification Number (CCN), must be an acute care hospital (defined as a \"subsection (d) hospi tal\" in section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act) or CAH that either: 1. Is physically located within the Community and receives at least 20% of its Medicare FFS revenue from Eligible Hospital Services provided to residents of the Community; or 2. Is physically locate d inside or outside of the Community and is responsible for at least 20% of Medicare expenditures for Eligible Hospital Services provided to residents of the Community. All other types of health care facilities are ineligible to be Participant Hospitals. I n the event that a hospital system has multiple inpatient campuses and outpatient locations, each inpatient 25 campus and outpatient location will be considered a distinct Participant Hospital as long as it separately meets the eligibility criteria in this se ction. Subject to CMS approval, Participant Hospitals may simultaneously participate in the Community Transformation Track and other Medicare value -based programs, models or demonstrations. If a Participant Hospital participates in a Medicare program, dem onstration or model, CMS may, in its sole discretion, make adjustments to the Participant Hospital's Capitated Payment Amount (CPA) to avoid duplicative accounting of, and payment or penalties for, amounts received by the Participant Hospital under such Me dicare program, demonstration, or model. Lead Organizations must ensure that each Participant Hospital signs a Participation Agreement with CMMI committing the Participant Hospital to, among other things, (1) assume accountability for hospital expenditures (as specified in Appendix XI. CPA Financial Methodology ) for the Medicare beneficiaries they serve that reside in the Community fo r the full duration of each Performance Period; (2) implement the activities outlined in the Transformation Plan, as applicable; and (3) report necessary quality and other data to CMMI. Lead Organizations, as the named CHART award recipients, will be respo nsible for ensuring that Participant Hospitals execute certain key model activities to be outlined in forthcoming Participation Agreements and in alignment with the activities described in Table 2. Funded Activities for Lead Organizations . To ensure their eligibility to participate in CHART, Participant Hospitals must sign Participation Agreements with CMMI in either Performance Period 1 or Performance Period 2. CMMI may allow additional opportunities for Participant Hospitals to sign Participation Agreements. Regardless of when a Participant Hospital signs a Participation Agreement, it will have up to two years to transition back to FFS reimbursement from the effective date of either (1) Model track termination or non -continuation; or (2) termination of the Participant Hospital's Participation Agreement. During this transition period, Participant Hospitals may continue to operate under a capitated payment arrangement until fully transitioned. A.4.4.3. State Medicaid Agency SMA participation is required under the Community Transformation Track of the CHART Model. If the Lead Organization is not the SMA, it must partner with the SMA to implement the CHART Model. The SMA must participate in the Advisory Council and serve as an Aligned Payer (see section A.4.5.3. Multi -payer Alignment ). To ensure that the SMA has the capacity to carry out CHART's program requirements, the SMA must be a subrecipient of cooperative agreement funding. As a component of the Community Transformation Track application, SMAs must submit a Memorandum of Under standing (MOU) with the potential Lead Organization (see section E.1.2.2.3. Health Care Delivery System Redesign Concept for MOU requirements) . 26 Table 3. SMA Activities Timing SMA Activities Pre- Implementation Period (15 months ) Execute and submit to the Lead Organization legally enforceable agreements as needed, including business associate agreements (BAAs) Participate in the Advisory Council, even if the SMA is located outside of the Community No later than 45 days after the start of the Pre -Implementation Period, meet with representatives of CMCS to begin designing and implementing any changes to its Medicaid program requ ired to execute CHART financial alignment (see section A.4.5.3. Multi -payer Alignment ) Collaborate with the Lead Organization to submit progress updates on executing CHART financial alignment (including a timeline agreed upon by the state and CMCS) as an appendix to Quarterly P rogress Reports (QPRs) (see section F.5. Reporting ) Performance Periods (6 years) Participate in the Advisory Council, even if the SMA is located outside of the Community Collaborate with the Lead Organization to submit progress updates on executing CHART financial alignment (including a timeline agreed upon by the state and CMCS) as an appendix to Quarterly Progress Reports (QPRs) (see section F.5. Reporting ) Align its Medicaid program with the Community Transformation Track APM (see section A.4.5. Value -Based P ayment ), including receipt of CMS approval of State Plan Amendments (SPA) and/or 1115(a) demonstration application(s) as needed and, if applicable, working with managed care plans to support APM implementation Meet Medicaid Participation Targets, as discussed in section A.4.5.3.2. Medicaid Alignment below The SMA must comply with all data and reporting requirements of the Model, including accurate and timely submission of T -MSIS data (see section F.5.3. Evaluation ), and establishing information sharing arrangements and infrastructure The Medicaid elements of the Model shall operate consistent with existing Medicaid laws and regulations. Acceptance of a Lead Organization into the CHART Model does not constitute approval of any changes to a state's Medicaid program. Information included in a CHART Model application will be used solely for the purpose of application review for the CHART Model and 27 does not represent a formal request for a State Plan Amendment or 1115(a) demonstration approval on the part of the state, nor a commitment to such approval on the part of CMS. States shall submit those requests through the existing CMS processes. The SMA will not be permitted to claim federal financial participation (FFP) for administrative activities for which the SMA receives cooperative agreeme nt funding through the Model to prevent the duplication of funding by CMS. Upon award, CMMI will help SMAs and Lead Organizations navigate modifications to their state's Medicaid authorities, if and as needed, to carry out their Transformation Plan. CMMI will work with the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS) to maximize process efficiency for reviewing proposed Medicaid State Plan Amendments (SPAs) and Medicaid waivers. CMMI, in collaboration with CMCS, will begin working with SMAs and Lead Organizations early in the process of developing their Transformation Plans, in order to quickly identify what Medicaid SPA(s) or waiver(s) might be necessary. See Appendix IX. Medicaid Needs Assessment for information on the pathways available to SMAs to implement the Commun ity Transformation Track APM . A.4.5. Value -Based Payment The capitated payment arrangement in the Community Transformation Track is designed to establish the financial flexibility necessary for Participant Hospitals to engage in health care delivery system redesign activities outlined in Transformation Plans. This APM offers a predictable and stable revenue stream, which mitigates fina ncial instability in rural hospitals and improves their capacity to weather volatility. In particular, methodology will incorporate adjustments 1) for service line changes and 2) exogenous factors (i.e., Public Health Emergencies). When Participant Hospitals' revenue is no longer predicated on realized volumes, they will be able to focus on more transformational and collaborative strategies, such as converting to a rural emergency medical center or reconfiguring service lines across multiple Participant Hos pitals ( e.g., one hospital shuts down an orthopedic line but refers volume to a neighboring hospital who has a larger and higher quality orthopedic program). In contrast to FFS incentives to grow volumes, this APM creates an incentive to reduce potentially avoidable utilization, prevent readmissions, and reduce hospital lengths of stay as appropriate. Participant Hospitals will be able to keep the savings that are generated through these reductions. Moreover, discounts applied to the Participant Hospitals' CPAs would secure first dollar savings for Medicare, Medicaid, and Aligned Payers, as described below. For purposes of the Quality Payment Program, the Community Transformation Track is not an Advanced APM or a MIPS APM. 28 A.4.5.1. Capitated Payment This section provides a description of the financial methodology CMMI will use to calculate the Capitated Payment Amount (CPA) for each Participant Hospital. CMMI will calculate CPAs, not Lead Organizations. The CPA financial methodology is included in this NOFO for informational purposes only and may change at CMMI's sole discretion. The final CPA financial methodology will be detailed further in a time and manner to be specified by CMMI. CMMI will calculate the CPA for each Participant Hospital located in the Community as follows: 1. Determine baseline Medicare FFS revenue using historical expenditures for Eligible Hospital Services. 2. Apply prospective adjustments to baseline revenue. 3. Apply a discount to the adjusted baseli ne revenue to yield the introductory CPA. 4. Apply mid -year adjustments to the introductory CPA to yield the mid -year CPA. 5. Apply end -of-year adjustments to the mid- year CPA to yield the final CPA. For purposes of this CPA financial methodology, Eligible Hospital Service means any health care service that meets the following criteria: 1. Is covered under Part A or Part B of Title XVIII of the Act; 2. Meets the Service Inclusion Criteria; and 3. Does not meet the Service Exclusion Criteria. Service Inclusion Criteria CMMI will include Medicare FFS expenditures associated with the following health care services, subject to otherwise meeting the definition of Eligible Hospital Service, in each Participant Hospital's CPA: Inpatient hospital or inpatient CAH services, including but not limited to physical therapy and certain drugs and biologicals. Outpatient hospital or outpatient CAH services, including but not limited to clinic, ED and observation services, X- rays and other radiology services billed by the Participant Hospital, and certain drugs and biologicals. Swing bed services rendered by CAHs. CMMI will provide a more detailed list of included services prior to potential Participant Hospitals signing Part icipation Agreements with CMMI. 29 Service Exclusion Criteria CMMI will exclude Medicare FFS expenditures associated with the following health care services from each Participant Hospital's CPA, and will continue to reimburse such services on a FFS basis using standard payment met hodologies: Physician services; Other professional services; Durable medical equipment; Hospice care; Home Health services; Swing bed services for non -CAH facilities; and All other services furnished by the Participant Hospital not included in the Service Inclusion Criteria above. CMMI may modify these Service Inclusion and Service Exclusion criteria from time to time throughout the duration of the Model . For Participant Hospitals that are not located inside the Community , CMMI may modify this CPA financial methodology to account for the Medicare FFS expenditures of beneficiaries located inside the Community only, rather than the total Medicare FFS revenu e of the Participant Hospital. Each step of the CPA financial methodol ogy is described in greater detail in Appendix XI. CPA Financial Methodology . A.4.5.2. Medicare FFS Payment Mechanism CMMI will replace FFS claims reimbursement for Participant Hospitals with regular, lump sum payments that equal the annual CPA over the cou rse of the Performance Period. Participant Hospitals must continue to submit FFS claims, but CMS will treat claims for Eligible Hospital Services as zero -pay. Continued claims submission is necessary to provide utilization data to inform many of the adjustments outlined in the CPA financial methodology, as well as for program monitoring and quality measurement. A.4.5.3. Multi -payer Alignment Multi -payer alignment refers to non -Medicare payers' adoption of the Community Transformation Track APM's financial, operational, and quality processes to ensure that differently insured residents benefit from APM- driven care transformation. The goal of multi - payer alignment in CHART is to increase Participant Hospitals' total revenue from Eligible Hospital Services such that care transformation becomes a more rational business decision. By Performance Period 2, each Lead Organization must secure multi -payer alig nment from the 30 SMA, in accordance with this section. Multi -payer alignment from commercial payers is recommended but not required. Requiring multi -payer alignment beginning in Performance Period 2 allows Lead Organizations and Aligned Payers, to address le gislative or regulatory barriers to payer participation, and build any IT infrastructure necessary to implement the APM. A.4.5.3.1. Payer Alignment Characteristics Lead Organizations and Participant Hospitals must collaborate to establish capitated payment arrangements with Aligned Payers. An Aligned Payer is an entity that makes payment for health care services and possesses the three Aligning Characteristics outlin ed in Table 4. Payer Alignment Characteristics below. E ach Aligned Payer may implement their capitated payment arrangement with Participant Hospitals dif ferently based on their plan benefits and member populations. For example: Aligned Payers may need to modify the financial methodology to account for smaller per-plan enrollment and/or more volatile year- over -year enrollment than Medicare FFS. Aligned Payers may not need to align with the adjustments that rely on CAH cost report data, since those are not relevant for other payers besides Medicare FFS. These modifications from the CPA financial methodology will be subject to CMMI approval in order to satisfy the financial alignment characteristic. Medical assistance payments under Medicaid would remain subject to Medicaid upper payment limits and disproportionate share hospital limits. Please see Appendix XI. CPA Financial Methodology for details. Each Aligned Payer will be responsible for calculating its non -Medicare FFS CPA for each Participant Hospital. Table 4. Payer Alignment Characteristics Characteristic Description Financial alignment The Aligned Payer uses a similar financial methodology as CMMI uses for the Community Transformation Track APM. To implement financial alignment, an Aligned Payer may need to build IT infrastructure or change internal policies ( e.g., Medicaid agencies may need to apply for state plan amendments or 1115(a) waivers). Operational alignment The Aligned Payer offers changes to health care provider contracts or benefits in compliance with existing law to support care transformation. For example, the Aligned Payer may offer benefit enhancements matching those available in Medicare FFS, or allow Participant Hospitals to make similar changes permitted under a potential Medicare waiver of hospital CoPs. 31 Characteristic Description Quality alignment The Aligned Payer uses the same set of quality measures to adjust payments or track performance (see section A.4.7. Quality Strategy ). A.4.5.3.2. Medicaid Alignment At a minimum, Lead Organizations must have the SMA as an Aligned Payer. Medicaid alignment may be achieved through alignment of Medicaid FFS, Medicaid managed care plans, or both. Lead Organization s, in collaboration with their SMA, will be required to meet the following Medicaid participation targets: Table 5. Medicaid Participation Targets Performance Period Medicaid Participation Target (% of each Participant Hospital's Medicaid revenue under a Capitated Payment Arrangement) Performance Period 1 0% Performance Period 2 50% Performance Period 3 60% Performance Period 4 75% Performance Period 5 75% Performance Period 6 75% A.4.6. Operational Flexibilities under the Model The Community Transformation Track will make available certain operational flexibilities to expand Lead Organizations ability to implement health care de livery system redesign and promote Participant Hospitals' capacity to manage their beneficiaries' care. Lead Organizations will be responsible for requesting operational flexibilities in their Transformation Plans in consultati on with Participant Hospitals . These flexibilities will be provided through a combination of the Model Design Flexibilities listed below and as well as through CMMI's authority under section 1115A(d)(1) of the Act to waive certain Medicare and Medicaid requirements, solely as may be necessary to test the Model . CMMI may waive such requirements of Titles XI and XVIII and of sections 1902(a)(1), 1902(a) (13), 1903(m)(2)(A)(iii), and provisions of section 1934 that were added to section 1115A(d)(1) by the PACE Innovation Act as may be ne cessary solely for purposes of carrying out section 1115A with respect to testing models described in section 1115A(b). 32 A Lead Organization, in collaboration with Participant Hospitals, may leverage any of the following Model flexibilities in designing and implementing their health care delivery system redesign strategy. Table 6. Model Design Flexibilities Model Flexibility Purpose of Flexibility Flexibility in Amount of Cooperative Agreement Funding Before the beginning of Performance Period 1, Lead Organizations may request to receive less cooperative agreement funding in exchange for a lower discount factor for their Participant Hospitals. CMMI may allow additional opportunities for Lead Organizations to request less coope rative agreement funding in exchange for a lower discount on a case by case basis . Flexibility in Collaborative Funding Use Lead Organizations may receive up to $5 million of cooperative agreement funding, but may pass some of the funding directly to Participa nt Hospitals for investing in and successfully implementing care delivery redesign efforts at the hospital -level. Flexibility in Applying Discounts Lead Organizations will be able to negotiate participant -level discount factors with Participating Hospitals, subject to CMS approval, so long as the aggregate discount equals the final discount factor for the total revenue in the Community. This will allow Participant Hospitals and Lead Organizations to optimize participant -level discount factors to ho spitals of different sizes to help recruit and retain Participant Hospitals. Flexibility for Service Line Adjustments When Participant Hospitals shut down a service line, they will lose revenue from that service line while other Participant Hospitals may gain revenue from additional utilization. To the extent that Lead Organizations are able to construct voluntary budget -neutral agreements with multiple Participant Hospitals, CMMI will distribute payments for service line adjustments between hospitals. Flexibility to Include or Exclude Outliers in the CPA Participant Hospitals have the ability to elect whether or not to participate in an optional outlier policy if they would like to limit the impact of extraordinarily high cost claims on their CPA. Flexibility in Care Transformation Strategy Communities will be able to develop care transformation strategies that are cu stomized to meet the needs of their beneficiaries, improve health outcomes, and maintain or improve access to care. For more information, see the Community Transformation Section. 33 Lead Organizations , in collaboration with Participant Hospitals, may request any of the policy flexibilities listed below in the A.4.6.1. Benefit Enhancements and A.4.6.2. Benefici ary Engagement Incentives sections. Lead Organizations will also have the ability to request other, specialized waivers of Medicare payment and participation rules. For example, CMMI may remove certain scope -of-practice barriers by waiving direct supervision and physician certification requirements, solely as necessary to test the Model. A.4.6.1. Benefit Enhancements CMMI plans to offer benefit enhancements, which may include but are not limited to the Medicare waivers described in Table 7 below. Table 7. CHART Medicare Program and Payment Policy Waivers Waiver Purpose of waiver SNF 3 -Day Rule Waiver (Section 1861(i) of the Act) This would waive the rule requiring a three -day stay in a Participant Hospital with swing -bed for approval of Medicare post -hospital extended care services prior to admission to a SNF. Telehealth Expansion (Section 1834(m) of the Act) This would expand allowable originating sites to include a beneficiary's place of residence for certain synchronous and asynchronous telehealth services. Services would be related to wellness visits, evaluation & monitoring, and analyzing patient images. Additionally, health care providers would be permitted to engage in telehealth services with individuals who are not established patients. Care Management Home Visits (Section 1835(a)(2)(A) of the Act ) This would allow Participant Hospitals to offer home visits to beneficiaries proactively and in advance of any potential hospitalization, and would waive the homebound requirement for receiving such services. Waiver of certain Medicare Hospital and/or CAH Conditions of Participation (CoPs) Waivers of Medicare CoPs could allow Participant Hospitals to make certain changes to their facility structure, and maintain their hospital or CAH status for the purpose of Medicare enrollment and certification, Medic are hospital quality reporting, and in order to receive payments under the capitated payment arrangement. CAH 96 Hour Certification Rule (Section 1814(a)(8) of the Act and 42 C.F.R. \u00a7424.15). This would waive the condition of payment for inpatient CAH s ervices that a physician must certify that a patient is expected to be discharged or 34 Waiver Purpose of waiver transferred within 96 hours of being admitted into a CAH. A.4.6.2. Beneficiary Engagement Incentives CMMI plans to allow beneficiary engagement incentives, which may include but are not limited to the Medicare incentives described in Table 8 below. Table 8. CHART Beneficiary Engagement Incentives Beneficiary Engagement Incentive Purpose of incentive Cost sharing for Part B services As a beneficiary engagement incentive, Participant Hospitals will be allowed to reduce or waive the applicable co -insurance on the Medicare allowed amount (estimated at approximately $10 per visit). Examples of potential criteria for waiving cost sharing could include: Financial need; Patients with high disease burden that would benefit from more frequent visits to avoid hospitalization and disease progression; and Patients with recent hospitalizations or ED visits. Transportation This will allow Participant Hospitals to offer free or discounted transportation services (to include a ride sharing service and a Participant Hospital's own contracted automobile) for beneficiaries requiring face to face care with a Participant Hospital and to connect beneficiaries with follow u p services, including trips to: A pharmacy or courier service for medication; An external specialist's office; Elective procedures; and Health care providers for other health -related services and activities. Gift Card Reward for Chronic Disease Management Programs This would allow Participant Hospitals to provide gift cards to eligible aligned beneficiaries for incentivizing participation and adherence in a chronic disease management program. 35 A.4.6.3. Fraud and Abuse Waivers The authority for the CHART Model is section 1115A of the Act. For this Model track and consistent with this standard, the Secretary may consider issuing waivers of certain fraud and abuse provisions in sections 1128A, 1128B, and 1877 of the Act. No fraud or abuse waivers are being issued in this document. Fraud and abuse waivers, if any, will be issued in separate documentation. CHART Model participants and their health care providers/suppliers must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, except as explicitly provided in any such separately documented waiver issued pursuant to section 1115A(d)(1) specifically for the CHART Model. Any such waiver will apply solely to the Community Transformation Track of the CHART Model and could differ in scope or design from waivers granted for other programs or models. A.4.7. Quality Strategy There are notable differences between rural and urban health outcomes and delivery systems that are likely to affect quality measure performance . In rural America, populatio ns have higher rates of chronic illness and have poorer access to health care services.12 Rural hospitals generally have lower volumes, resulting in data suppression on public reporting sites and greater sensitivity to the effects of outliers. Data collection and reporting also are more challenging for rural health care providers, which often have less staff and fewer financial resources to dedicate to these information gathering activities.13 Rural hospitals continue to lag behind larger hospitals in urban areas in electronic health record (EHR) adoption rates, limiting their capacity to use he alth IT (HIT) to support quality -improvement processes and promote case management or care coordination.14 Beyond the ability to collect and report data, low patient volumes affect the reliability, validity, and utility of performance measures, some of whic h may be better suited for urban areas.15 The CHART Model's quality strategy aligns with the 2019 CMS Quality Strategy and CMS's Meaningful Measures Framework launched in 2017.16 17 Similar to these CMS initiatives, the CHART Model's quality strategy aims to : Align financial incentives with quality improvement goals; Emphasize patient choice and engagement; Strengthen beneficiaries' access t o and coordination of care; Facilitate health care delivery system redesign that aligns with Communities' needs; and Address health disparities that may exist in rural communities, including among different demographic groups . 36 To promote improvement in health outcomes, while minimizing administrative burden, CHART's quality strategy focuses on a limited set of measures relevant to rural populations. CHART's measures target quality at both the Community and Participant Hospital levels, and a majority of the measures are claims -based. Any measures that are not claims -based are associated with high priority clinical outcomes or are components of major CMS quality programs . CMMI will track reporting and performance on each of the CHART quality measures as part of its monitoring strategy and will use performance on the measures to calculate the quality score used to adjust CP As, as discussed in section A.4.5.1. Capitated Payment . As a condition of participation Lead Organizations, and Participant Hospitals within their Comm unity, will be required to report on the same six quality measures for the duration of the Model: 1. CMMI will determine the three required measures; and 2. The Lead Organization will select the remaining three measures from a list of options developed by CMMI. Aligned Payers will be required to report on the same six measures that their Lead Organization selects. Table 9 below outlines the three required measures and the list of measures Lead Organizations may choose from for t heir remaining three measures . Table 9. CHART Quality Measures Quality and Population Health Domains Measure Steward Identifier Type All Lead Organizations or Participant Hospitals in the Model must report on the following three measures. Chronic Conditions Inpatient and ED visit for ambulatory care - sensitive conditions Agency for Health Care Research and Quality Prevention Quality Indicator 92 Outcome Care Coordination Hospital -Wide All - Cause Unplanned Readmission CMS National Quality Forum 1769 Outcome Patient Experience and Engagement Hospital Consumer Assessment of Health Care CMS National Quality Forum 0166 Outcome 37 Quality and Population Health Domains Measure Steward Identifier Type Providers and Systems Lead Organizations or Participant Hospitals must report on at least three of the following measures from the following domains . Substance Use Use of Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder* CMS National Quality Forum 3400 Process Use of Opioids at High Dosage in Persons without Cancer Pharmacy Quality Alliance National Quality Forum 2940 Process Maternal Health PC-02: Cesarean Birth The Joint Commission National Quality Forum 0471 Outcome Contraceptive Care - Postpartum US Office of Population Affairs National Quality Forum 2902 Outcome Prevention Influenza vaccination CMS National Quality Forum 1659 Process Preventive Care and Screening: Screening for Depression and Follow -up Plan CMS National Quality Forum 0418 Process Continuity of Primary Care for Children with Medical Complexity Seattle Children's Research Institute National Quality Forum 3153 Process *All-payer reporting will use NQF 3400 as the measure, however given the availability of data for Medicare FFS, pharmacotherapy for OUD will be collected using CMS' Integrated Data Repository data linked to Part D claims. Using this approach, performance for Medicare FFS will report an inverse value relative to NQF 3400 (i.e., percent of beneficiaries with OUD diagnosis with NO evidence of pharmacotherapy for OUD treatment, rather than percent of beneficiaries with OUD diagnosis with pharmacotherapy treatment administered, as stated for NQF 3400). The Community's population health needs and goals for health care transformation will inform the Lead Organization's quality measure selection. Lead Organizations will describe their rationales for selecting their three or more chosen measures in their Transformation Plans during the Pre -Implementat ion Period . In addition, Lead Organizations will be required to 38 implement their own monitoring programs, which may entail tracking additional quality measures, as necessary, to monitor progress toward the stated goals outlined in their Transformation Plans , including measures that capture any unintended or undesired impacts on quality. Participant Hospitals will continue reporting on core measures in Medicaid, quality measures in Medicare, and other existing CMS quality programs. CHART is exploring alignment between its Quality Strategy and the voluntary Federal Office of Rural Health Policy (FORHP) Medicare Beneficiary Quality Improvement Program (MBQIP). Additionally, CAH participation in CHART's Quality Strategy shall align with the mandatory Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement Program (regulation \u00a7485.641, effective March 30, 2021). In addition, CHART is exploring the ability for these measures to be stratified by different demographic groups where there is sufficien t volume and sample size. CHART will also explore additional measures that relate to health equity and reducing health disparities, which may inform Transformation Plan development and quality performance as appropriate. The FORHP, as well as accrediting organizations such as the National Quality Forum, continually work to identify additional appropriate quality measures for rural communities. CMMI will seek to align with those efforts over the course of the CHART Model. CMMI reserves the right to modify o r add to the list of measures . In this case, Lead Organizations must modify their measure sets accordingly. A.4.8. Implementation and Learning Support The CHART implementation and monitoring contractor will support award recipients with program operations by facilitating reporting requirements, managing program data, and assisting in the monitoring of program implementation and compliance. During the periods of performance, CMMI may request modification to a Lead Organization's Transformation Plan, as deta iled in section A.4.3.2. Transformation Plan, or associated documents to ensure continued program integrity and to streamline program operations with contractor functions. CMMI will provide Lead Organizations and Participant Hospitals w ith a learning system over the course of the CHART Model. For CHART Model participants, learning system activities may include but are not limited to virtual site visits, virtual/in -person meetings, affinity groups, case studies, and webinars geared toward s increasing understanding of Model requirements, sharing best practices on engaging community stakeholders, forging meaningful partnerships, and providing assistance with developing and implementing Transformation Plans. These activities will allow partic ipants to share their experiences, track their progress, glean promising practices from their peers, and rapidly adopt new ways of achieving improvements in care delivery. Lead Organizations and Participant Hospitals are required to participate in learning system activities. 39 A.4.9. Model Timeline Lead Organizations' participation in the CHART Model will begin with a Pre -Implementation Period, during which they will regularly convene and collaborate with their Advisory Council, prepare Transformation Plans, and engage Aligned Payers and potential Participant Hospitals. During the Pre -Implementation Period, Lead Organizations will submit, and CMMI will review and approve, Transformation Plans and other requested documentation.

Upon award, Lead Organizations will finalize, with CMMI review and approval, their health care delivery system redesign strategy in the form of the Transformation Plan by or before the end of the Pre -Implementation Period . E.1.2.2.4. Impact Analysis 10 Points Applicants should describe specific impact goals and the strategies they plan to implement to achieve them. Applicants should quantify effects as much as possible. Specifically, applicants must: 58 1. Identify how their proposed interventions will impact quality of care , access to care , and health disparities (especially for primary, behavioral health, substance use disorder treatment, chronic disease management and prevention, and maternal and infant health); 2. Describe how their health care delivery system redesign will yield savings in community - wide health care spending (applicants should consider whether proposed changes could lead to cost increases); and 3. Describe the impact of their proposed program on beneficiaries' health outcome s. E.1.2.3. Sustainability Pl an 10 Points CMMI will use information provided in this section to assess the likelihood that an award would lead to sustained change after the Model Performance Period ends. Applicants must describe their strategy for sustaining their health care delivery system redesign in the event that the Model is NOT extended after the final Performance Period. It may not be feasible for an award recipient to sustain the entirety of their program if the Model is not extended. Thus, in this section applicants should: 1. Identify which elements of their health care delivery system redesign strategy could be sustained if the Model was not extended and describe how they would sustain those program elements. 2. If applicable, applicants should describe whether they have secured a ny supplemental sources of funding, are in the process of securing supplemental funding, or have any plans to explore supplemental funding sources (see Appendix VIII. Additional Resources for Applicants: Literature and Funding Opportunities ). NOTE: S ecuring supplemental funding is NOT a program requirement. E.1.2.4 . Evaluation 5 Points Applicants should use this section to describe their strategy for ensuring participation in the CMMI's mandatory Model evaluation from all Model partners and participants, including Participant Hospitals, patients, and any other individuals or entities. Applicants must: 1. A description of how the applicant will ensure they meet the evaluation requirem ents of the Model. 2. Indicate their willingness to participate in qualitative evaluation tasks, which may include coordinating with the evaluation contractor to arrange site visits, observations, interviews, and focus groups with health care providers and pa tients as well as program staff. 59 3. Indicate their willingness and ability to submit program documents, training materials, and any other program -related materials to CMMI and its contractors and to assist in arranging other data gathering activities in accor dance with applicable law. 4. Demonstrate their capacity to provide patient- and program- level data, provide personal identifiers that will allow all patients to be identified in Medicaid FFS and managed care claims, and submit patient medical information th rough a system that complies with all applicable privacy and security requirements, including HIPAA and 42 C.F.R. Part 2; obtaining required consent and authorization; and other activities as needed. 5. Indicate whether there will be any restrictions on appli cants' ability to share protected health information (PHI) and/or personally identifiable information (PII) with CMMI, for example, any applicable federal or state laws. a. If so, include an explanation of whether those restrictions would prevent the SMA, Lead Organization, or Participant Hospitals from participating in evaluation activities 6. Applicants must describe the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T - MSIS) data submission status of their SMA. If the applicant's SMA is not submitting production data monthly to T -MSIS and/or their catch- up data files are not current at the time of application, then the applicant must coordinate with the SMA to submit a timeline for achieving timely, monthly production data submission. If the SMA believes it may be unable to submit T -MSIS data for any portion of the CHART Performance Period, the applicant must provide CMMI with a data submission plan for Medicaid claims data. E.1.3. Additional Required Documentation E.1.3.1. Model Budget Narrative 20 Points Applicants should provide a reasonable justification for the proposed Model budget for the Pre - Implementation Period and each Performance Period. Applicants must respon d to each of the requirements set out in section A.4. Program Requirements . Specifically, applicants should provide a budget with sufficient detail that would allow CMMI to understand how the applicant would meet their objectives given their budget and to assess the reasonableness of the proposed budget. Applicants should clearly identify apportionment of funds between the Lead Organization and other entities and provide line items for all activities related to Model implementation. In particular, per CHART's program requirements (see section A.4.4.3. State Medicaid Agency ) the SMA must be a named subrecipient of CHART cooperative agreement funding. The budget must se parate out funding that will be administered directly by the Lead 60 Organization from funding that will be subcontracted to other partners. Though the Lead Organization and SMA must partner together to submit an application and implement this award, only one entity will be the award recipient. For more information on subrecipient and contractual relationships, please refer to HHS regulation 45 CFR 75.351 Subrecipient and Contractor Determinations and 75.352 Requirements for pass -through entities. Applicants m ust verify they understand that they are required to avoid program duplication and ensure that award funds are not used to duplicate or supplant current federal, state, or local funding. Specifically, award funds cannot be used for the non -federal share of Medicaid payments. Finally, applicants should identify what current (not required) or potential future supplemental funding streams could apply to these activities, and identify gaps toward which they could apply Model funding. The Budget Narrative may be single or double -spaced and should not exceed 10 pages in length. E.2. Review and Selection Process Please refer to Appendix V. Review and Selection Process for more information on th e review and selection process. E.3. Federal Awardee Performance Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) In accordance with 45 CFR Part 75: I.

B. Administrative Requirements All equipment, staff, and other budgeted resources and expenses must be used exclusively for the projects identified in the applicant's original application or agreed upon subsequently with HHS, and may not be used for any prohi bited uses. 63 Consumers and other stakeholders must have meaningful input into the planning, implementation, and evaluation of the project. This award is subject to 45 CFR Part 75, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for HHS awards [available at Electronic Code of Federal Regulations website] which implements 2 CFR Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (\"Uniform Guidance\") effective December 26, 2014. See below for more information. C. Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements Applicant and award recipients should take particular note of the following information found in 45 CFR Part 75: Uniform Administrative Requirements In accordance with 45 CFR \u00a775.112, all award recipients receiving federal funding from CMS must establish and comply with the conflict of interest policy requirements outlined by CMS (available for applicant upon request). In accordance with 45 CFR \u00a775.113, Mandatory Disclosures, the non -Federal entity or applicant for a Federal award must disclose, in a timely manner, in writing to the HHS awarding agency or pass- through entity all v iolations of Federal criminal law involving fraud, bribery, or gratuity violations potentially affecting the Federal award. Non -Federal entities that have received a Federal award including the term and condition outlined in Appendix XII to 45 CFR Part 75 are required to report certain civil, criminal, or administrative proceedings to SAM. Failure to make the required disclosures can result in the imposition of any of the remedies described in \u00a775.371, including suspension or debarment. (See also 2 CFR Parts 180 and 376, and 31 U.S.C. 3321). For specific information on reporting such disclosures to CMS and HHS please see section F.3. Terms and Conditions of this NOFO. Cost Principles CMS grant and cooperative agreement awards provide for reimbursement of actual, allowable costs incurred and are subject to the Federal cost principles. The cost principles establish standards for the allowability of costs, provide detailed guidance on the cost accounting treatment of costs as direct or indirect, and set forth allowability and allocability principles for selected items of cost. Applicability of a particular set of cost principles depends on the type of organization. Award recipients must comply with the cost principles set forth in HHS regulations at 45 CFR Part 75, Subpart E with the following exceptions: (1) hospitals must follow Appendix IX to p art 75 and commercial (for- profit) organizations are subject to the cost principles located at 48 CFR subpart 31.2. As provided in the cost principles in 48 CFR subpart 31.2, allowable travel costs may not exceed those established by the Federal Travel Reg ulation (FTR). 64 There is no universal rule for classifying certain costs as either direct or indirect (also known as Facilities & Administration (F&A) costs) under every accounting system. A cost may be direct with respect to some specific service or function, but indirect with respect to the Federal award or other final cost objective. Therefore, it is essential that each item of cost incurred for the same purpose is treated consistently in like circumstances either as a direct or F&A cost in order to avoi d double -charging of Federal awards. Guidelines for determining direct and F&A costs charged to Federal awards are provided in 45 CFR \u00a7\u00a775.412 to 75.419. Requirements for development and submission of indirect (F&A) cost rate proposals and cost allocation plans are contained in Appendices III -VII, and Appendix IX to Part 75. Indirect Costs HHS will reimburse indirect costs to award recipients under an award if (1) allowable under the governing statute, regulations, or HHS grants policy; (2) the award recipi ent requests indirect costs; and (3) the award recipient has a federally approved indirect cost rate agreement covering the grant supported activities and period of performance or the non- federal entity has never received an indirect cost rate and elects t o charge a de minimis rate of 10% of Modified Total Direct Costs (MTDC). If the applicant entity has a current negotiated indirect cost rate agreement (NICRA) and is requesting indirect costs, a copy of the current NICRA must be submitted with the application . Any non- Federal entity that has never received a negotiated indirect cost rate, except for those non-Federal entities described in Appendix VII(D)(1)(b) to 45 CFR part 75, may elect to charge a de minimis rate of 10% of MTDC which may be used indefinitely. Commercial (For- Profit) Organizations: Indirect Costs are allowable under awards to for- profit organizations. The for- profit award recipient must have a federally -approved indirect cost rate agreement covering the grant supported activities and period of performance. Indirect cost rates for for -profit entities are negotiated by DFAS in the Office of Acquisition Management and Policy, National Institutes of Health (if the preponderance of their federal awards are from HHS), available at NIH Office of Management, Office of Acquisition Management and Policy website, or other Federal agency with cognizance for indirect cost rate negotiation. If there is no federally -approved indirec t cost rate for the specific period of performance and the for-profit award recipient has never received an indirect cost rate, then the non- federal entity may elect to charge a de minimis rate of 10% of MTDC. Cost Allocation In accordance with 45 CFR \u00a775.416 and Appendix V to Part 75 - State/Local Government -wide Central Service Cost Allocation Plans, each state/local government will submit a plan to the HHS Cost Allocation Services for each year in which it claims central service costs under Federal awards. Guidelines and illustrations of central service cost allocation plans are provided 65 in a brochure published by the HHS entitled \"A Guide for State, Local and Indian Tribal Governments: Cost Principles and Procedures for Developing Cost Allocation Plans and Indirect Cost Rates for Agreements with the Federal Government.\" A copy of this brochure may be obtained from the HHS Cost Allocation Services at HHS agency program support center website. A current, approved cos t allocation plan must be provided to CMS if central service costs are claimed. Public Assistance Cost Allocation Plans Appendix VI to Part 75 - Public Assistance Cost Allocation Plans, provides that state public assistance agencies will develop, document and implement, and the Federal Government will review, negotiate, and approve, public assistance cost allocation plans in accordance with Subpart E of 45 CFR part 95. The plan will include all programs administered by the state public assistance agency. W here a letter of approval or disapproval is transmitted to a state public assistance agency in accordance with Subpart E, the letter will apply to all Federal agencies and programs. This Appendix (except for the requirement for certification) summarizes th e provisions of Subpart E of 45 CFR part 95. Audit Requirements The audit requirements in 45 CFR Part 75, Subpart F apply to each award recipient fiscal year that begins on or after December 26, 2014. A non -Federal entity that expends $750,000 or more during the non- Federal entity's fiscal year in Federal awards must have a single or program -specific audit conducted for that year in accordance with the provisions of Subpart F, Audit Requirements. Commercial Organizations (including for -profit hospitals ) have two options regarding audits, as outlined in 45 CFR \u00a775.501 (see also 45 CFR \u00a775.216). F.3. Terms and Conditions This Notice of Funding Opportunity is subject to the Department of Health and Human Services Grants Policy Statement (HHS GPS) at HHS agency website . The general terms and conditions in the HHS GPS will apply as indicated unless there are statutory, regulatory, or award -specific require ments to the contrary. Standard and program specific terms of award will accompany the NoA. Potential applicants should be aware that special requirements could apply to cooperative agreement awards based on the particular circumstances of the effort to be supported and/or deficiencies identified in the application by the HHS review panel. HHS regulation (45 CFR Part 75) supersedes information on administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for grants and cooperative agreements inclu ded in the current HHS Grants Policy Statement where differences are identified. Recipients must also agree to respond to requests that are necessary for the 66 evaluation of national efforts and provide data on key elements of their own grant or cooperative agreement activities. HHS may terminate any CMS award for material noncompliance. Material noncompliance includes, but is not limited to, violation of the terms and conditions of the award; failure to perform award activities in a satisfactory manner; improper management or use of award funds; or fraud, waste, abuse, mismanagement, or criminal activity. In the event an award recipient or one of its subrecipients enters into proceedings relating to bankruptcy, whether voluntary or involuntary, the award rec ipient agrees to provide written notice of the bankruptcy to CMS. This written notice shall be furnished within five (5) days of the initiation of the proceedings relating to bankruptcy filing and sent to the CMS Grants Management Specialist and Project Of ficer. This notice shall include the date on which the bankruptcy petition was filed, the identity of the court in which the bankruptcy petition was filed, a copy of any and all of the legal pleadings, and a listing of Government grant and cooperative agre ement numbers and grant offices for all Government grants and cooperative agreements against which final payment has not been made. Intellectual Property Award recipients under this solicitation must comply with the provisions of 45 CFR \u00a7 75.322, Intangibl e property and copyrights. The non- Federal entity may copyright any work that is subject to copyright and was developed, or for which ownership was acquired, under a Federal award. The Federal awarding agency reserves a royalty -free, nonexclusive, and irre vocable right to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the work for Federal purposes, and to authorize others to do so. The non -Federal entity is subject to applicable regulations governing patents and inventions, including government -wide regulations issue d by the Department of Commerce at 37 CFR part 401.

F.5.2. Monitoring CMMI Monitoring Plan As part of the Community Transformation Track of the CHART Model, CMMI will implement a monitoring plan designed to protect beneficiaries and address potential program integrity risks. CMMI will employ a range of methods to monitor and assess compliance by the Lead Organization and Participant Hospitals to ensure compliance with the terms of the Cooperative Agreement and the Participation Agreements with Participant Hospitals. CMMI monitoring activities may include, but are not limited to: Claims analyses to identify fraudulent behavior or program inte grity risks such as inappropriate reductions in care, overutilization, and cost -shifting to other payers or populations; Interviews with any individual or entity participating in the Model including members of leadership and management and associated health care providers and suppliers; Interviews with CHART beneficiaries and their caregivers; 70 Audits of charts, medical records, Implementation Plans, and other data from participating hospitals and health care providers; Site visits to participating hos pitals; and Documentation requests sent to the hospitals including surveys and questionnaires Quarterly and Annual Performance Progress Reports: Each Lead Organization will be required to submit quarterly progress reports (QPR) and annual performance pro gress reports (APR). CMMI will provide Lead Organizations with guidance and a template for progress report submissions. These reports will include narrative updates on Model activities as well as information on operational and performance requirements in accordance with the CHART Model cooperative agreement. CMMI will use the quarterly and annual reports to track progress on Model goals, identify technical assistance needs, and inform learning activities for all participants. The operations and performance requirements will support CMMI efforts to confirm that each Lead Organization is delivering high quality care to beneficiaries. CMMI will also share these findings with Lead Organizations individually on an ongoing basis for quality improvement purposes. C MMI will consider Lead Organizations for corrective action, funding restrictions, or termination if they do not meet the Model reporting requirements outlined in their cooperative agreement Notice of Award and Terms and Conditions or other federal award do cumentation. F.5.3. Evaluation CMMI will evaluate the CHART Model pursuant to section 1115A (b)(4) of the Act. Lead Organizations will be required to provide data and interact with CMMI and the CMMI independent evaluation contractor in accordance with 42 C .F.R. \u00a7 403.1110. Evaluation data may include, but is not limited to, individually identifiable health information that is needed to carry out CMMI's evaluation of the CHART Model, hosting and managing site visits, and making staff available for interviews (on site or telephonic). Lead Organizations will be responsible for ensuring that aligning payers report quarterly and annual utilization and monthly expenditures. CMMI will not collect individually identifiable information from Aligned Payers. CMMI will seek to reduce burden in requests for additional evaluation data from Lead Organizations and Participant Hospitals. IRB approval or any other permissions are the sole responsibility of applicants and their partners. CMMI will utilize data from the Transfor med Medicaid Statistical Information System (T -MSIS) to monitor and evaluate Medicaid outcomes. Lead Organizations are responsible for coordinating with SMAs to ensure they are submitting accurate and complete T -MSIS data. CMMI will require that a Lead Org anization demonstrate its SMA's ability to submit T -MSIS data 71 of sufficient quality and completeness, both when the Lead Organization responds to this NOFO and when it submits its Transformation Plans annually.

Timely Receipt Requirements and Proof of Timely Submission All grant and cooperative agreement applications must be submitted electronically and received through Grants government website by 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard or Daylight Time (Baltimore, MD) by the applicable deadline date. Please refer to the Executive Summary of this Notice of Funding Opportunity for submission deadline date. Proof of timely submission is automatically recorded and an electronic date/time stamp is generated within the system when the application is successfully received by Grants.gov. The AOR who submits the application on behalf of the organization will receive an acknowledgement of receipt and a tracking number (GRANTXXXXXXXX) with the successful transmission of their application, as well as the official date/time stamp and Grants.gov tracking number in an email serving as proof of their timely submission. When CMS successfully retrieves the application from Grants.gov, and acknowledges the download of submissions, Grants.gov will provide an electronic acknowledgment of receipt of the application to the email address of the AOR who submitted the application. Again, proof of timely submission shall be the official date and time that Grants.gov receives your application. Applications received after the established due date for the program will be considered late and will not be conside red for funding by CMS. Please note, applicants may incur a time delay before they receive acknowledgement that the application has been accepted by the Grants.gov system. Applicants should not wait until the application deadline to apply because notifica tion by Grants.gov that the application is incomplete may not be received until close to or after the application deadline, eliminating the opportunity to correct errors and resubmit the application. Applications submitted after the deadline, as a result o f errors on the part of the applicant, will not be reviewed. Applicants using slow internet, such as dial- up connections, should be aware that transmission can take some time before your application is received. Again, Grants.gov will provide either an error or a successfully received transmission in the form of an email sent to the applicant with the AOR role attempting to submit the application. The Support Center reports that some applicants end the transmission because they think that nothing is occurri ng during the transmission process. Please be patient and give the system time to process the application. To be considered timely, applications must be received by the published deadline date. However, a general extension of a published application deadline that affects all State applicants or only those in a defined geographical area may be authorized by circumstances that affect the public at large, such as natural disasters ( e.g., floods or hurricanes) or disruptions 90 of electronic ( e.g., application receipt services) or other services, such as a prolonged blackout.

Medicaid Needs Assessment The following questionnaire is a required component of the CHART application. The SMA must submit this questionnaire within their MOU, as described in section E.1.2.2.3. Health Care Delivery System Redesign . SMAs are encouraged to note any areas of uncertainty and/or any items that are yet to be determined. To assist SMAs with the questionnaire, guidance on how different Medicaid payment models can be leveraged to meet CHART's financial alignment requirement is provided below the questionnaire section. The Medicaid Needs Assessment Questionnaire will be used to expedite collaboration between the SMA and CMS, if the applicant is selected to participate in the CHART Model. Responses to this questionnaire are not considered final and do not represent a formal request for a State Plan Amendment, waiver, or demonstration nor a commitment to approval on the part of CMS. The state's Medicaid aligned CHART payment model must meet Medicaid federal statutory and regulatory requirements in order to be eligible fo r federal financial participation . Medicaid Needs Assessmen t Questionnaire SMA Point of Contact CMS may contact the SMA with clarifying questions upon review of their questionnaire (the applicant would be copied on any such communication). Accordingly, please provide the following information for a SMA point of co ntact. Name: Job Title: Email: Phone Number: General Questions : 1.

Does the SMA plan to waive statewideness, freedom of choice, and /or comparability? If so, identify which authority will be used. a. If the state is planning to implement the CHART Model on a sub -state basis and does not believe a statewideness waiver is needed, please provide a rationale. 110 A. State Pl an Amendment (SPA) If the SMA intends to modify the Medicaid state plan to implement CHART, please provide the following information (if the SMA does not plan to modify the Medicaid state plan, do not respond to the following questions and proceed to secti on B. Medicaid Managed Care Authority ): Please describe your intended design by answering the following: 1. What changes does the SMA intend to make to the state plan? 2. Which Medicaid benefit categories would the proposed services fall under? 3. What payment met hodology would be used to cover the proposed services? o NOTE: payment methodologies must comply with all Medicaid statutory and regulatory requirements. 4. Who would provide the proposed services to Medicaid beneficiaries? o NOTE: federal matching funds can onl y be provided for Medicaid authorized services provided by Medicaid qualified providers to eligible Medicaid beneficiaries. Please elaborate on how you would implement this design by answering the following: 1. Would the state's planned CHART Model be operated through managed care, fee -for- service, or both? 2. Does the state's planned CHART Model change eligibility, benefits, and/or services for some but not all Medicaid beneficiaries? If so, is the state planning to request an Amount Duration and Scope (ADS) waiver and/or a comparability waiver? B. Medicaid Managed Care Authority If the SMA intends to implement CHART using Managed Care Authority, please provide the following information (if the SMA does not plan to use Managed Care Authority, do not respond to the following questions and proceed to section C. 1115(a) D emonstration) : 1. Will this payment arrangement be operationalized for services/beneficiaries covered under risk-based Medicaid managed care contracts (MCO, PIHP, or PAHP)? 2. Which managed care programs will be impacted by this payment arrangement? 3. Wha t is the rating period(s) that will be affected? 111 4. Is the state directing how plans pay their providers (referred to as a state directed payment and defined in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.6(c)); or is the state pursuing a withhold or incentive arrangement for the plans (defined in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.6(b))? 5. If the state is pursuing a state directed payment as defined in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.6(c): a. What providers/services will be affected? b. Is the payment arrangement going to replace the rates negotiated by plans with providers for services covered under the contract or would the payments be in addition to negotiated rates? c. If the payments would be in addition to the rates negotiated between the plans and providers, what is the estimated total dollars that would be added to the rate certification for such payments? What do you expect the effect to be on total reimbursement for the providers ( e.g., would the total rate paid to the provider (negotiated rates plus state directed payments) be above Medicare)? d. Does the state intend to inc orporate a value -based purchasing model? What is the anticipated role of risk -sharing? e. What are the conditions that providers must meet to obtain payment? f. Do providers have to achieve performance on a select set of quality measures? If so, what is the mea surement period for determining payment? g.

Does the state expect to need any additional demonstration waiver authorities under 1115(a)(1) to implement the model? If so, please describe the authorities to be requested. 4. Does the state intend to request expenditure authority under 1115(a)(2) to implement the model? a. If yes, what services would expenditure authority be requested for? b. Are the people receiving t he services already Medicaid eligible? Please elaborate on how you would implement this design by answering the following: 5. Does the state's planned CHART Model change eligibility, benefits, and/or services for some but not all Medicaid beneficiaries? If so, is the state planning to request an Amount Duration and Scope (ADS) waiver and/or a comparability waiver? Medicaid Pathway Guidance A. Alignment through State Plan Amendments Capitated Payments for Hospitals under State Plan Authority CMS will consider state plan payment methodologies that include downside risk for providers through value -based advanced payment strategies, where providers receive an advanced payment amount to care for individuals attributed to them based on historic Medicaid expenditures as well as care patterns and outcomes of care. This payment methodology may align with the capitated payment arrangement in the Community Transformation Track. States that wish to pursue this payment model must receive approval from CMS for these payment models and the Medicaid payments under the state plan must comply with section 1902(a)(30)(A) of the Social Security Act. States will be expected to ensure, through an approved reconciliation process, that total payments are consistent with \"effic iency, economy and quality of care,\" and are also \"sufficient to enlist enough providers...\" to meet statutory access requirements, of section 1902(a)(30)(A) of the Act. In reviewing state proposed methodologies, CMS will ensure payments are consistent with all requirements in section 1902(a)(30)(A) of the Act, including \"efficiency, economy, and quality of care.\" CMS is available 113 to work with states to develop reconciliation processes that would comport with applicable statutory requirements . After conducti ng the reconciliation, states could potentially hold providers at risk for losses in the event that actual care expenditures for attributed beneficiaries exceed the monthly payments that have been paid over a defined period. States also could reward provid ers when quality is improved and care expenditures fall below the monthly payments made to providers by allowing them to retain some or all amount identified through reconciliation as exceeding actual care expenditures. Importantly, to ensure consistency w ith section 1902(a)(30)(A) of the Act, when care expenditures fall below monthly payments and quality improvements are not evident, a provider would need to return the portion of the monthly payments to the state representing the monthly payments paid in e xcess over actual care expenditures. States may define reasonable thresholds for what may be acceptable provider losses or gains in such arrangements, to ensure that provider gains and losses are moderated, where appropriate or necessary to satisfy the req uirements of section 1902(a)(30)(A) of the Act. Moreover, CMS will review state proposals to ensure state defined thresholds are consistent with requirements in section 1902(a)(30)(A). Considerations for Advanced Payment Methodologies with a SPA We encoura ge states to work closely with CMS when developing advanced payment methodologies to achieve their intended goals for value -based payment (VBP) reform. As always, state plan amendments must be consistent with federal requirements and should advance improve d care for beneficiaries, smarter spending, and healthier communities. To that end, CMS has released the Value -Based Care Opportunities in Medicaid State Medicaid Director Letter (VBC SMDL).33 The VBC SMDL offers states planning and methodological considera tions that should be factored into any value -based payment that aligns with the CHART payment model, as well as technical guidance that CMS expects states will address in VBP SPAs. We expect states to consider each of the methodological components describe d in the VBC SMDL to ensure consistency with section 1902(a)(30)(A) of the Act as states develop a proposal for CMS to review. We note all federal statutory and regulatory requirements on state financing to fund the non- Federal share apply under VBP method ologies. Importantly, consistent with the VBP strategies discussed within the VBC SMDL, we expect advanced payments to improve quality and health outcomes and for states to have meaningful quality strategies in place to ensure the methods are not detrimental to quality and access to care, which would be inconsistent with section 1902(a)(30)(A) of the Act. Advanced payment methods should not be based only on cost savings or result in harm to Medicaid beneficiaries. CMS will review proposed advanced payment m ethodologies to ensure they comply with all statutory and regulatory financing requirements. As states develop proposed advanced payment methodologies, they must meet the expectations in the VBC SMDL and in general should 114 consider the following questions ( do not need to answer at this point, during the application process): Does the methodology partially or fully align with an Innovation Center model? What are any material differences? If the methodology aligns with an existing Innovation Center model, could the state use existing Medicaid authorities to replicate or simulate the model in their program? Does the methodology apply to services available statewide to all individuals under the state plan or does it limit benefits to geographic regions or to populations residing in geographic regions in the state? If a state intends to add new benefits via this methodology and geographically limit their provision, the state may need to obtain 1115 waiver authority. We note advanced payment methodologies under the state plan may only be based on Medicaid coverable services consistent with section 1905(a) of the Act. Are the payments under the methodology available to all Medicaid providers or are they limited based on provider eligibility criteria? What are the provider eligibility criteria? What beneficiary notification and protection processes ( e.g., beneficiary complaint lines, state Medicaid ombudsman, etc.) are in place to ensure no harm results from the advanced payment model, and how will Medicaid program requirements be ensured (e.g., maintenance of free provider choice, no reduction in amount, duration and scope of a medically necessary service, etc.)? What methodology will be used to attribute beneficiaries to providers? What claims and payment data will be used to determine advanced payments, including: the source of data, the time period of the data and how the data will account for population cost variation? Are claims reviews conducted to prevent up -coding and inappropriate restrictions on care ( e.g., providers are providing and appropriately coding for necessary care, and not restricting their provision of certain expensive procedures to limit expenditures for attributed beneficiaries)? What are the timeframes and procedures for conducting reconciliation and returning FFP to CMS, where appropriate? (Please note, in the case of an excess of advance payments in relation to actual services furnished, states must return the federal share of amounts repaid by providers in accordance with 42 CFR Part 433, Subpart F. Claims for FFP for advanced payments and any related reconciliation payments are subject to the two-year timely filing requirements described at 45 CFR Part 95, Subpart A.) 115 Does the state conduct reviews at least annually and make necessary adjustments to the methodology to ensure consistency with economy, efficiency and quality care, as well as sufficient access to covered services for beneficiaries? What are the quality measures, reporting processes and appropriate incentives to maximize the likelihood that the methodology will result in better care and better value? B. Alignment through Managed Care CMS recognizes that the majority of Medicaid beneficiaries are served in managed care arrangements. The Medicaid managed care regulations in 42 C.F.R. part 438 permit a variety of mechanisms that states can utilize to address delivery system reforms and value -based payments through their managed care plan contracts. These include: Directed Payments (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.6(c)). Federal Medicaid managed care regulations include requirements for how states may implement delivery system and prov ider payment initiatives through Medicaid managed care. With limited exceptions, Medicaid managed care regulations generally prohibit states from directing a managed care plan's expenditures to providers for services that are covered under contract. States must develop actuarially sound rates that cover the costs for delivery of services under the contract; managed care plans, as risk -bearing entities, have the responsibility to manage risk for delivery of those services. In order to do that, managed care p lans must be able to fully utilize the payment under the contract for the delivery of services. When states direct managed care plan expenditures under the contract, doing so can undermine the risk -based nature of the contract and distort payments based on arbitrary state financing mechanisms rather than service utilization or provider performance. However, pursuant to 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.6(c), CMS sets forth exceptions to the general prohibition on state direction of how much and through what kind of arrangeme nt a managed care plan pays providers who furnish covered services. The exceptions include state -directed implementation of value -based purchasing models and other service payment models, participation in delivery system reform or performance improvement initiatives, and certain minimum fee schedules. The payment arrangements identified in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.6(c) permit states to direct specific payments made by managed care plans to providers under certain circumstances (\"state directed payments\") and can ass ist states in furthering the goals and priorities of their Medicaid programs, including to promote VBP initiatives. For example, a state may require managed care plans to adopt specific VBP models ( e.g., Accountable Care Organizations) or incentive payments ( e.g., incentive payments based on reducing potentially preventable readmissions). State directed payment arrangements under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.6(c) are required, among other things, to be based on the utilization and delivery of services to Medicaid benefi ciaries covered 116 under the contract rating period; to direct expenditures equally for a defined class of providers using a common set of performance measures; and to advance at least one of the goals and objectives in the state's quality strategy. States ar e required to receive written prior approval from CMS using the preprint form posted on the Medicaid.gov website. In addition, all payment arrangements approved under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.6(c) are required to conform to federal regulatory requirements, includin g that they be incorporated into managed care contracts and rate certifications. Approval of a state directed payment under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.6(c) does not constitute approval of the financing mechanism for the non- federal share, and states will need to work with the appropriate CMS staff to obtain the necessary appr ovals of a financing mechanism. States interested in incorporating state directed payments into their managed care programs, including those to align with CHART, should consult the resources avail able on Medicaid government website on managed care and state directed payments guidance , including the Appendix to our November 2017 CIB on State Directed Payments, which provides more detail on the Accountable Care Organization model as well as the incentive payments based on reducing potentially preventable readmissions mentioned above. We e ncourage states to reach out early for technical assistance to expedite CMS' review of preprint proposals, including to discuss essential parameters, such as evaluation and quality metrics. Please e -mail StateDirectedPayment@cms.hhs.gov with questions or requests for technical assistance. Managed Care Plan Incentive Payments (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.6(b)(2)). States may also use incentive payments to reward managed care plans that accelerate provider adoption of VBP in line with performance targets specified in the managed care plan contract, including implementation of a mandatory performance improvement project under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.330(d) that focuses on adoption of VBP models and percentage of plans' provider payments through VBP arrangements. These incentive payments represent additional funds over and above the capitation rates. Incentive payments must comply with all requirements in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.6(b)(2), including that managed care plan contracts incor porating incentive payments must not provide for payment in excess of 105 percent of the approved capitation payments attributable to the enrollees or services covere d by the incentive arrangement. In the 2016 managed care final rule (81 FR 27498, 27530 (M ay 6, 2016)), CMS specified that incentive payments made to a managed care plan in accordance with 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.6(b)(2) should not be included in the denominator of the medical loss ratio (MLR), as such payments are in addition to the capitation payments received under the contract. However, these MLR standards can support states and managed care plans in their efforts to design and implement comprehensive VBP acceleration strategies by ensuring amounts can be appropriately identified and classified within each managed care plan's MLR . 117 Managed Care Plan Contracting Strategies. States may also develop and implement specific managed care plan procurement and contracting strategies to promote CHART goals. For example, states may require managed care plans, t hrough their plan contracts, to adopt a specific VBP model that was developed by the Medicaid agency or other stakeholders and payers, including requiring participation in a multi -payer VBP initiative, provided that the requirements in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.6(c) are met. Such an approach - particularly if aligned with commercial, Medicare, Marketplace, and other payers with longer term contracts - may promote consistency, reduce the burden on providers to participate, align incentives, and enable the state to acc elerate VBP across Medicaid an d beyond. States also may contractually implement a generic requirement for managed care plans to utilize VBP or alternative payment arrangements when the state does not mandate a specific payment methodology and managed care plans retain the discretion to negotiate with network providers the specific terms for the amount, timing, and mechanisms of such VBP or alternative care arrangements. While states may design the specific requirements in line with their VBP goals, states may consider an approach whereby the proportion of each managed care plan's provider payments tied to VBP models increases over time ( e.g., 5 percent in Year 1; 10 percent in Year 2; 15 percent in Year 3, etc.). In addition, or as an alternative to the state defining specific VBP goals, states may allow managed care plans to submit proposed VBP arrangements for approval and demonstrate achievement of the contracted benchmark by providing supporting data, as reques ted and required by the state. C. Alignment through 1115 Demonstration Authority CMS acknowledges that there may be instances when a state requires additional flexibility to adopt an Innovation Center model or pursue other delivery system reforms that are not available through the authorities described above. These instances should be limited to when a state wants to pilot a geographically limited payment or delivery system model, limit benefits to certain populations, and offer benefits not available under any other regulatory authority . In such ci rcumstances, CMS welcomes the opportunity to work with states on state -driven proposals that take into account their unique needs and capabilities, consistent with the principles and reflecting the lessons outlined above . In these cases, a state may need section 1115(a)(2) expenditure authority in order to make an advance payment to a provider for a service that has not yet been rendered to a Medicaid beneficiary. In this case, the state would describe its payment methodology and how it aligns with the CMMI CHART model (including patient attribution, applicable measures, achievement targets, approach to risk -bearing, and incentive payment methodology) and that methodology would be subject to CMS approval as part of a Medicaid section 1115(a) demonstration. This expenditure authority would only be necessary if there are no other pathways to implement this payment m odel. 118 As with any section 1115 demonstration, states will be expected to follow the transparency requirements as outlined at 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 431.408 an d to provide information to ensure that the demonstration will be budget neutral . Federal Medicaid expenditures in the state, with the demonstration, may not exceed wha t expenditures would have been without the demonstration, across the same time period. Finally, states will be required to monitor the demonstrations and regularly report to CMS on a set of defined metrics and milestones and to ensure an independent evalua tion of demonstration impacts and outcomes. CMS welcomes states to engage with CMS as they plan an approach to the CHART Model that addresses unique state needs. CMS and states will work together to identify available authorities and submit the required applications and amendments as needed. CMS is available to provide technical assistance to states on how to meet federal transparency requirements as well as to preview states' draft 1115 proposals and public notice documentation to help ensure states succ essfully meet federal requirements. 119 Appendix X. Transformation Plan Requirements Core components of Transformation Plans are outlined below for informational purposes and may change at CMMI's sole discretion . CMMI will provide award recipients a final, more specific list of Transformation Plan requirements at a time and in a manner to be specified by CMMI . 1. A survey of the Community's key strengths and challenges to be leveraged and addressed through CHART participation, i ncluding a preliminary assessment of the population health, access, and quality outcomes of greatest interest to the community (e.g., specific chronic conditions of focus or health disparities to target) . 2. A description of the health care delivery system redesign strategy that the Lead Organization, SMA, and Participant Hospitals plan to pursue to improve health outcomes and lower health care costs, as well as supporting documentation including: a. A description of the role of each Participant Hospital in the health care delivery system redesign strategy including the following elements: i. A recruitment and engagement plan for Participant Hospitals that will occur in the following Performance Period and ii. A transition plan, developed with Participant Hospitals, that describes: 1. How and when Participant Hospitals may revert from a CPA back to Medicare FFS (as described in section A.4.4.2. Participant Hospitals ), 2. How such transition may affect beneficiaries and other health care providers in the Community, and 3. A mitigation strategy to address those risks; b. A description of planned changes to health care services provided in the region; c. A description of how approved operational flexibilities, as discussed in section A.4.6. Operational Flexibilities under the Model , will be implemented by Participant Hospitals to support the Community's transformation goals and the anticipated impact on the Model population; and d.

A description of the agreed upon support and/or participation of involved parties ( e.g., Participant Hospitals, the SMA, and Aligned Payers) in the health care delivery system redesign strategy. 5. A description of existing programs and models in the Community that identifies the potential for duplicative overlaps, as well as an explanation of strategies to ensure that CHART funding will not duplicate other CMS Models or CMS programs. CMMI will use this information t o verify that cooperative agreement funds are not used to supplant or duplicate funds from other CMMI Models or CMS programs. 121 Appendix XI. CPA Financial Methodology The CPA financial methodology is included in this NOFO for informational purposes and ma y change at CMMI's sole discretion, changes may include but are not limited to modifications for exogenous factors (i.e., Public Health Emergencies or PHEs, such as COVID -19) and to ensure CMS savings. The CPA financial methodology will be detailed further by CMMI prior to the start of the P re-Implementation Period. For purposes of this CPA financial methodology, expenditures refer to the amount CMS paid out to Participant Hos pitals for Eligible Hospital Services, and revenue refers to the amount Participant Hospitals received from CMS for Eligible Hospital Services. Step 1. Determine baseline revenue using historical expenditures for Eligible Hospital Services. For the first P erformance Period that a Participant Hospital participates in the Community Transformation Track APM, each Participant Hospital's baseline CPA will be based on the portion of services that it provides to the Community, as defined by section A.4.3.1. Community Definition, using the simple average of hospital expenditures from the two calendar years starting three years prior to the first period the Participant Hospital joins up to one year prior to the hospita l's first performance year ( e.g., CYs 2019- 2020 for Performance Period 1 scheduled to occur in 2022, but subject to change). The average will be calculated after each historical year has been adjusted according to the prospective adjustments defined in Ste p 2 below, to ensure that the years are comparable. For subsequent years that a Participant Hospital participates in the APM, the Participant Hospital's baseline revenue will be equal to the CPA for the prior Performance Period (e.g., the baseline revenue for Performance Period 2 will be equal the CPA for Performance Period 1). The CPA will be updated as mid -year and end - of-year adjustments are made to the prior Performance Period 's CPA. Step 2. Apply prospective adjustments. Each Participant Hospital's baseline revenue will be adjusted to account for differences in either 1) between the baseline years and Performance Period 1, or 2) between the previous Performance Period and the current Performance Period (for Performance Period 2 through Performance Period 6). There are two categories of prospective adjustments made to baseline revenue prior to the start of each Performance Period : unit price and population adjustments. Unit price adjustments for acute care hospitals . Unit pr ice adjustments differ for acute care hospitals and CAHs. For acute care hospitals, the following elements are included in the unit price adjustment: Trend : A trend representing the expected percentage change in Medicare FFS expenditures from the baseline year to the Performance Period. CMMI, in consultation 122 with the CMS Office of the Actuary (OACT), will calculate a prospective trend based on recent national data. If the observed regional trend differs from the projected national trend by more than three percentage points, CMS may retrospectively update the trend at the time that end- of-year adjustments are performed. Geographic Adjustment Factor : The year -over -year change in the wage index is applied to the labor portion of expenditure amounts (operational portion of the inpatient expenditures and 60 percent of the outpatient expenditures), and the year -over -year change in the capital geographic adjustment factor is used to adjust the capital expenditure amount of inpatient claims. Quality adjustment: For Performance Period 1, the change in adjustments between the baseline year and Performance Period 1 for the Participant Hospital's performance in the following quality programs, as applicable, is taken into account: Value -based purchasing program: Applied t o the labor and non- labor portion of expenditure amounts of inpatient claims. Hospital acquired condition (HAC) reduction program: T he change in HAC score (Total HAC score greater than the 75th percentile of all Total HAC scores will be subject to a 1 percent payment reduction) is used to adjust the labor and non - labor portion of expenditure amounts of inpatient claims. Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP): T he year -over -year change in HRRP payment adjustment factor is used to adjust the relevant expenditure amounts of inpatient claims. Beginning in Performance Period 2 and all subsequent Performance Period s, each Participant Hospital's CPA will also be adjusted based on its performance on CHART quality measures. Beyond current Medicare quality programs, the additional CHART Quality adjustment will impact no more than 2% of the CPA. See section A.4.7. Quality Strategy for more details on the CHART quality measures. This adjustment will be applied at the Community level to incent all Participating Hospitals within the Community to collaborate. Additionally, this adjustment will be applied during annual reconciliation. Award recipients will receive further guidance on how CPAs will be adjusted for quality for Participant Hospitals, including hospitals paid under the Inpatient Prospective Payment System and Critical Access Hospitals, before the start of Pre-Implementation Period. Population adjustment: The population adjustment accounts for differences in the population served by the Participant Hospital between the baseline years and the 123 Performance Period. It captures differences in population size, demographics such as age, and shifts in Eligible Hospital Services between hospitals. The population size adjustment will be defined as a change in beneficiary months for the defined Community. Beneficiaries are aligned if they are eligib le and reside in the Community for the majority of the alignment period. The alignment period is the 12 -month period beginning 18 months prior to the respective baseline or Performance Period. The beneficiary must not move out of the Community before or during the respective baseline or Performance Period. The population demographic will be defined as a change in the demographic -only HCC Risk Score. The shift in Eligible Hospital Services adjustment will be defined as a change in the distribution of service between hospitals. The population adjustment will avoid over -payment for Eligible Hospital Services by reducing revenue from a Participant Hospital's baseline CPA if the population served by the Participant Hospital decreased between the baseline years an d the Performance Period or if Eligible Hospital Services shifted between health care providers between the baseline years and the Performance Period. In CMMI's experience with payment mechanisms similar to capitated payments, the predictability of payment is not only attractive to hospitals in periods of decline, but also to hospitals in periods of growth. The population adjustment will allow CMMI to appropriately adjust CPAs to account for either scenario. Mid -year and end -of-year population adjustments w ill correct for any differences between projected and observed shifts in Eligible Hospital Services. Unit price adjustments for CAHs. For CAHs, the unit price adjustment consists of the change in the interim payment rate between the cost report that the CAH submitted for the baseline years and the most recently available, adjudicated cost report. Starting in Performance Period 2, each p articipating CAH's CPA may also be adjusted for its performance on CHART quality measures. Award recipients will receive further guidance on how CPAs will be adjusted for participant hospitals quality prior to the start of the Pre -Implementation Period. Step 3. Apply a Discount In order for payers to realize savings, a small percentage discount will be applied to the CPA. It is expected that Participant Hospitals can achieve savings, despite the presence of a discount, through reductions in potentially avo idable utilization. Acknowledging the financial instability of many rural hospitals and the time it may take for Transformation Plans to result in reduced potentially avoidable utilization, the discounts will start at 0.5 percent and increase slowly. Each Participant Hospital will have a 0.5 percent discount applied in Performance Period 1 and 1.0 percent discount applied in Performance Period 2. Beginning in Performance Period 3, each Participant Hospital's discount will vary depending on the total revenue the Community. These discounts increase for the remainder of the Mo del. 124 Starting in Performance Period 3, CMMI will apply lower discounts to CPAs in Communities with higher total revenue under a capitated payment arrangement. This variance provides an incentive for Communities to recruit more hospitals to participate in the APM by Performance Period 3 and increases the likelihood that the APM will yield savings that meet or exceed the amount of the cooperative agreement funding. Based on the total Medicare FFS revenue under the capitated payment arrangement, the discount is based on a schedule of discounts listed in the Capitated Payment Arrangement Discounts table below: Capitated Payment Arrangement Discounts Total Medicare FFS Revenue in the Community u nder a Capitated Payment Arrangement (x) at or below: Performance Period 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 < x 15 million (M) 0.5% 1.0% 2.5% 3.0% 1.3% 1.5% 125 As detailed in A.4.5.3.1. Payer Alignment Characteristics , each Aligned Payer, including Medicaid, must possess the Financial Alignment Characteristic demonstrated through aligning with the CPA financial methodology and providing CPAs to Participant Hospitals. Each Aligned Payer may imp lement its capitated payment arrangement with modifications based on their plan benefits and member populations. One modification available to Aligned Payers is the option to remove the discount factor from their respective CPA. Specific to Medicaid, CMMI and CMCS will collaborate to issue guidance on how Medicaid savings will accrue for SMAs that maintain the discount factor in their CPA. All CPA financial methodology modi fications will be subject to CMMI approval. Step 4. Apply mid -year adjustments to CPAs As the Performance Period progresses and additional data become available, several adjustments will be applied to CPAs, including but not limited to: Population adjustme nt: A mid -year population adjustment will be applied as additional data on population size, demographics, and shifts between hospitals become available. CAH interim payment rate adjustment: If CMMI adjudicates a new cost report for a participating CAH afte r the calculations of the prospective CPA, the CPA will be updated mid-year to account for the updated interim payment rate. Adjustment for mid -year and end -of-year adjustments to the prior year's CPA : Because the calculation of the CPA is prospective, it may be calculated for the upcoming Performance Period before mid -year and end -of-year adjustments have been applied to the current Performance Period. Therefore, a given Performance Period's CPA will be adjusted as additional data from the mid -year and end -of-year adjustments to the prior Performance Period's CPA become available. Step 5. Apply end -of-year adjustments to CPAs The following adjustments will be applied after the end of each P erformance Period , with six months of claims run -out. If the adjustm ents indicate that additional payment is owed to the Participant Hospital, or that the CPAs made to the Participant Hospital were too high, CMMI may either reconcile the discrepancy through a one -time payment or adjust the following Performance Period's CP A to make up the difference. 260 < x 280 M 0.5% 1.0% 1.0% 1.0% 1.0% 126 Population adjustment: The population adjustment will be applied again after the end of the Performance Period , when full utilization data are available for the Performance Period . Outlier adjustment: During the pre -implementation period, CMS may allow Participant Hospitals the ability to elect whether or not to participate in an optional outlier policy to protect Participant Hospitals from unexpected, catastrophically expensive utilization not accounted for in th eir prospective CPAs. Participant Hospitals may elect not to participate in such an arrangement if they believe that their cost -reduction efforts will impact outlier costs (which has been observed in preliminary evaluation results for the Next Generation A ccountable Care Organization or NGACO Model). 127 1 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. \" Rural Health.\" Available: Link to CMS Rural Health Equity initiative 2 J.M.
