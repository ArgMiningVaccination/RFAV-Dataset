It's the latest of at least a dozen studies, according to King, to show no connection. Researchers examined data on more than 95,000 kids with older siblings, including almost 2,000 with an older sibling with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), to assess risk among those already at higher likelihood of developing autism because of a family connection.

The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Health and Human Services, used claims data from a large commercial health plan, the Optum Research Database, part of insurer [UnitedHealth](/quotes/UNH/). In addition to the Lewin Group, authors came from Optum and Drexel University in Philadelphia. The publication comes after low immunization rates led to four outbreaks of measles in the U.S. this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including [117 cases tied to an outbreak stemming from California's Disneyland](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/02/10/us-measles-count-rises-to-121-most-linked-to-disneyland.html). Last year saw 668 cases, according to the CDC, the most since measles was declared eliminated in the country in 2000.

The study illuminated reluctance among some parents to immunize their children if an older sibling has been diagnosed with autism. Research has shown [a child has a higher likelihood of developing autism if they have an older sibling with autism spectrum disorder](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/16/autism-risk-for-siblings-higher-than-expected/?_r=0). In the JAMA study, among kids whose siblings didn't have autism, the MMR vaccination rate was 84 percent at age 2 and 92 percent at age 5. For kids with older siblings with autism, the vaccination rates were lower: 73 percent at age 2, and 86 percent at age 5.

The concern over a link between the MMR vaccine and measles dates to [a since-retracted study published in the Lancet in 1998](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(97)11096-0/abstract), reporting on just 12 kids. Tuesday's JAMA study, of more than 95,000 kids, and 994 with autism, builds on several previous studies showing no link between autism spectrum disorder and the MMR vaccine. \"The only conclusion that can be drawn from the study is that there is no signal to suggest a relationship between MMR and the development of autism in children with or without a sibling who has autism,\" King wrote in the accompanying editorial. \"Taken together, some dozen studies have now shown that the age of onset of ASD does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children, the severity of course of ASD does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children, and now the risk of ASD recurrence in families does not differ between vaccinated and "}
