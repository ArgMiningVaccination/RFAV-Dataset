Use this section to understand and follow national and Nevada guidelines to detect and diagnose latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in children. detect and diagnose TB disease in ch ildren. know when to report suspected or confirmed cases of TB in children. follow basic treatment principles for latent tuberculosis infection and TB disease in children. select appropriate pediatric treatment regimens, dosages, and duration. monitor pediatric patients for side effects and adverse reactions. assess pediatric patients' response to treatment. determine completion of therapy for pediatric patients Children, especially infants, because of immature immune function are at increased risk of progressing rapidly to active and so metimes severe TB disease after they become infected. The diagnosis of TB in children, especially in children under 5 years of age, can be difficult because they often have nons pecific signs and symptoms and a small number of mycobacteria. Clinical symptoms, when present, may include fever, delayed growth of child , weight loss or poor weight gain, cough, night sweats, and ch ills. Identification of a young child with TB usually indicates recent transmission from an infectious adult with TB. It is considered a sentinel event needing urgent and careful investigation. All children suspected or diagnosed with active tuberculosis or LTBI should have a PHN Case Manager assigned. NEVADA TUBERCULOSIS PROGRAM MANUAL Revised MAR 2020 Diagnosis and T reatment of LTBI and TB Disease in Children 12.2 Call your local TB Program for consultation regarding the evaluation and treatment of pediatric patients with TB and LTBI.

For complicated pediatric TB cas es, consult the Curry International Tuberculosis Center Warm line at: 415-502-4700 or 877-390-6682 Report sus pected and confirmed cases of pediatric tuberculosis disease to the Nevada Division of Public and Behavio ral Health TB Program at 775-684-5936, FAX 775-684-5999. Background Pediatric TB is defined by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as TB in children less than 15 years of age. Pediatric TB prese nts unique ch allenges. Infants and children are at increased risk of progression to active disease if infected. Unlike adu lts and older adolescents who most commonly have reactivation disease, TB disease in infants and children is usually related to primary TB, and this may occur quickly after they become infected. Infants and children have less specific signs and symptoms of disease, some are asymptomatic. The clinical manifestations and radiographic abnormalities seen in children are influenced more by the host inflammatory reaction than by the number of organisms. Administration of TB medications to infants and children is often difficult. It is also important to remember that pediatric TB is a sentinel event, reflecting recent infection from an infectious, often undiagnosed, source case in the co mmunity. Pathogene sis of TB Most children become infected with tuberculosis by inhaling droplet nuclei co ntaining Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) bacteria that have been e xpelled by coughing persons with infectious pulmonary or laryngeal TB. Inhaled bacteria are taken up by alveolar macroph ages and, if not immediately destroyed, may cause an initial \"primary\" pulmonary infection that consists of a small focus in the lung parenchyma that spreads via local lymphatics to regional lymph nodes. When all age groups are taken into account, most recent infection is asymptomatic and does not result in disease--the primary focus heals, and the bacteria continue to survive in a dormant state that is referred to as latent TB infection (LTBI). But in young children under five years of age and in children with immune deficiencies, there may be no latent period and the primary infection may progress. There may also be comp lications related to enlargement of the area of infection in the lung parenchyma or regional lymph nodes causing wheezing, pneumonia, or atelectas is by compressing or eroding through a bronch us. NEVADA TUBERCULOSIS PROGRAM MANUAL Revised MAR 2020 Diagnosis and T reatment of LTBI and TB Disease in Children 12.3 Primary TB infection is usually accompanied by an occ ult, subclinical b acteremia that seeds distant sites, including the apices of the lungs, the lymph nodes and the central nervous system. In young ch ildren and children with immune disorders, se vere example, dissemi nated (miliary) TB or TB meningitis, sometimes quickly follows the primary infection, even in the weeks before development of a positive Mantoux tuberculin skin test (TST). This is the reason why \"window period proph ylaxis\" with isoniazid is recommended for exposed young children and immunocompromised ch ildren until infection can be excluded. The risk of progress ion to TB disease following prima ry infection is mainly related to the age and immune status of the child. The risk is highest in young children under two to three years of age and immunocompromis ed children.1 Table 1, below, \"Average Age -specific Risk for Disease Development after Untreated Primary Infection, \" illustrates risk and age . Studies show that disease develops within 1 to 2 years in 40% to 50% of infants with untreated TB infection comp ared to 15% among older children. Other conditions associated with increased risk of progress ion include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; use of immunosuppressive drugs, such as prolonged or high-dose therapy or chemotherapy; intravenous drug use; and ce diseases or medical co nditions, including Hodgkin disease, lymphoma, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and malnutrition. There have been reports of tuberculosis disease in adolescents being treated for arthritis with tumor n ecrosis factor (TNF) antagonists, such as infliximab and etanerce pt.

Mantoux Tuberculin Skin Testing (TST) The Mantoux TST is the most commonly used method used in Nevada for identifying TB infection in children under 5 years . In children, the TST is an important part of the clinical case definition of TB, but it is important to remember that children with active TB may have a negative TST. This is especially true for infants under six months of age and for infants and children with immune disorders. A negative TST does n ot guarantee that a child does not h ave latent TB infection or TB disease. Candidates for Testing Testing is recommended for children at high risk of LTBI or progression of LTBI to TB disease. Some examples are children who are contacts of a known case of TB, children with suspe cted active disease, children with known risk factors for progression of infection to disease, children traveling or residing for 3 months or longer in an area with a high incidence of TB, and children who ar rived in United States from co untries with a high TB incidence within the previous 2 years. The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases recommends testing of infants, ch ildren, a nd adolescents from se veral h igh-risk groups . These recommendations are summarized in Table 2 below. TST Recommendations for Infants, Children, and Adolescents See the following table, Table 2, Tuberculin skin test (TST) and IGRA recommendations for infants, children, and adolescents, page 12.5. NEVADA TUBERCULOSIS PROGRAM MANUAL Revised MAR 2020 Diagnosis and T reatment of LTBI and TB Disease in Children 12.5 Table 2 : TUBERCULIN SKIN TEST (TST) AND IGRA RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INFANTS, CHILDREN, AND ADOLESCENTS * Children for whom immediate TST or IGRA is indicated** Cont acts of people with confi rmed or suspected infectious tuberculosis (contact investiga tion) Child ren with radiographic or cli nical findings suggesting tuberculosis disease Child ren immigrating from count ries with endemic infection (e.g., Asia, Middle East, Africa, Latin America, count ries of the former Soviet Union) including international adoptees Child ren with travel histories to countries with endemic infec tion and subs tantial contact with indig enous people such countries*** Childr have annu al TST or IGRA: Childr en infected with HIV infection (TST only ) Childr en at increased r isk of pr ogression of LTBI to tuberculo sis disease: Childr en with other medical conditions, including diabe tes mellitus, chron ic renal failure, malnutrition, congenital or acquir ed immunodeficiencies and children receiving tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists de serve special consideration. Wi thout recent exposur e, these people are n ot at increased r isk of acquiring M. tuberculosis infection. Und erlying immune deficiencies associated with these conditions theoretically would enhance the possib ility for pro gression to severe disease. Initial histories of potential exposure to tuberculosis should be included f or all of these pa tients. If the se histories or local epidemiologic fact ors suggest a possibility of exposur e, immediate and periodic TST or IGRA should be considered. A TST or IGRA should be performed before initiation of immunosuppr essive therapy, including prolong ed systemic corticosteroid a dministration, organ transplantation, use of TNF- alpha antagonists or blockers, or other immunosup pressive therapy in any child requiring these treatments. *Bacille Calm ette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) immunization is not a contraind ication to a TST. **Beginning as early as 3 months of age for TST, 3 years of age for IGRAs for LTBI and disease. ***If the child is well and has no history of exposure, the TST or IGRA should be delayed for up to 10 weeks after r eturn.

[Tuberculosis] In: Kimberlin DW, Brady MT, Jackson MA, Long SS, eds. Red Book: 2015 Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases. 30th ed. Elk Grove Village, IL: American Academy of Pediatrics; 2015:[p.812]. Admini stration and Interpretation of the T uberculin Skin Test TSTs need to be administered and interpreted by experienced h ealth care professionals who received appropriate training. Administration and interpretation by unskilled persons or family members are unreliable and may lead to errors in placement and interpretation . The Mantoux method c onsists of 5 tuberculin units of purified protein derivative (0.1 mL) injected intradermally using a 27-gauge needle and a 1.0-mL syringe into the volar aspect of the forearm. Creation of a visible wheal 6 to 10 mm in diameter is crucial to accura te testing. The recommended time for assessing the TST result is 48 to 72 hours after administration. However, a reaction that develops at the site of administration more than 72 hours later sh ould be measured and considered the result. The diameter of induration in millimeters is measured transversely to the long axis of the forearm. NEVADA TUBERCULOSIS PROGRAM MANUAL Revised MAR 2020 Diagnosis and T reatment of LTBI and TB Disease in Children 12.6 Only the Mantoux TST should be used. Multiple puncture tests are not sufficiently accurate and should not be use d. History of BCG vaccination is not a contraindication to TST. A TST can be administered before or at the same time as inactive and live-virus vaccines, including measles-containing vaccine and varicella vaccine. TST has no effect on the response to MMR vaccination. However, measles vaccine and mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines may transiently suppress the TST in a person infected with M. tuberculosis. Simultaneously administering TST and live virus vaccine does not interfere with reading the TST at 48 to 72 hours. If the live virus vaccine has already been administered, the TST should be deferred for four to six weeks.3 Approximately 10% to 15% of immunocompetent children with culture-documen ted disease do not react initially to a TST. Host factors, such as young age, poor nutrition, immunosuppression, other viral infections (especially measles, varicella, and influenza), recent tuberculosis infection, and dissemi nated tuberculosis disease can decrease TST reactivity. Many children and adu lts co-infected with HIV and M. tuberculosis do not react to a TST. Control skin tests to assess cutane ous anergy are not recommended routinely. Classification of TST results are based on epidemiologic and clinical factors. The size of induration (mm) required for a positive result varies with the person's risk of LTBI and progression to tuberculosis disease. Table 3, below, summarizes the size of reaction and interpretation of results for children. The interpr etation of TST results in children who have received BCG vaccinat ion is the same as for persons who have not recei ved BCG vaccine. For more information, see the BCG Section that follows. The Nevada TB Program recommends prompt clinical a nd radiographic evaluation of all children and ado lescents with pos itive TST reactions. For children under 5 years of age with positive TST or IGRAs a two - view chest radiograph is required; PA (posterior/anterior) and lateral.

Red Book: 2003 Report of the C ommittee on Infectious Diseases . 25th ed. Elk Grove Village, IL: American Academy of Pediatrics; 2003:642 -660. Interferon-Gamma Relea interferon-gamma release assa ys (IGRAs) are an alternative to the tuberculin skin test. One advantage of these tests over the TST is that they are unaffected by BCG vaccination and infections with common non-tuberculous mycobacteria. Two examples are the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In Tube (QFT-GIT) test and the T-SPO T TB test. 4,5 These tests involve incubation of peripheral blood T-lymphocytes with antigens that are specific to M. tuberculosis. If an individual has been infected with M. tuberculosis, his or her T- lymphocytes will respond to the antigens by releasing interferon gamma. The sensitivity of IGRAs is similar to that of TST for detecting infection in adu lts with untreated culture-confirmed tuberculosis. The specificity of IGRAs is higher than that for TSTs, because the antigens used are not found in BCG or most nontuberculous mycobacteria.6 NEVADA TUBERCULOSIS PROGRAM MANUAL Revised MAR 2020 Diagnosis and T reatment of LTBI and TB Disease in Children 12.8 Although these tests are approved by the FDA and recommended by the CDC for use in adults in all circumstances in which the TST is use d, the TST remains the test of choice for children under the age of 2, per the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases publication , 2018 Red Book .7 As with TSTs, IGRAs cannot distinguish between latent infection and disease, and a negative result from these tests cannot exclude the possibility of tuberculosis infection or disease in a patient with findings that raise susp icion for these conditions. IGRAs are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and some experts prefer IGRAs for use in adults in all circumstances in which a TST is used. The published experience with testing children with IGRAs is less extensive than for adults, but a number of studies ha ve demonstrated that IGRAs perform well in most children 4 years of age and older.8 Accord ing to the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases, neither an IGRA nor the TST can be considered a 'gold standard' for diagnosis of LTBI. Current recommendations for use of IGRAs in children can be summarized as follows: For immunocompetent children 2 years of age and older (updated 2018) , IGRAs can be used in place of a TST to confirm cas es of tuberculosis or cases of LTBI and likely will yield fewer false- positive test results. Children with a positive result from an IGRA should be considered infected with M tuberculosis comp lex. A negative IGRA result cannot universally be interpreted as absence of infection. Because of their higher specificity and lack of cross-reaction with BCG, IGRA s are the preferred tests in asymptomatic children older than 2 years of age who have been immunized against BCG. IGRAs may be useful to determine whether a BCG-immunized child with a reactive TST more likely has LTBI or has a false-positive TST reaction caused by the BCG. In general, if the IGRA result is negative and the TST result is positive in an as ymptomatic ch ild, the diagnosis of LTBI is unlikely.9 IGRAs cannot be recommended routinely for use in children younger than 2 years of age or for immune-compromised children of any age because of a lack of published data about their utility with these groups. Indeterminate IGRA results do not exclude tuberculosis infection and shou ld not be us ed to make clinical decisions.10 NEVADA TUBERCULOSIS PROGRAM MANUAL Revised MAR 2020 Diagnosis and T reatment of LTBI and TB Disease in Children 12.9 BCG Vaccine BCG (bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin) vaccine is a live from attenuated strains of Mycobacterium bovis. BCG vaccine is widely used in many countries to protect infants and children against se vere forms of TB disease, including miliary TB and TB meningitis. Use of BCG vaccine is recommended by the Expanded Programme on Immunizations of the World Health Organization (WHO) for administration at birth and is currently used in more than 160 countries.11 BCG vaccination has been sh own to have relatively high protective efficacy (approximately 80%) against the severe forms of TB disease, meningeal and miliary tuberculosis, in children. The protective efficacy against milder forms of TB disease is l ess clear; for pulmonary TB, the measured efficacy varies significantly, from 0% to 50% in different studies.12 BCG is not generally recommended for use in the United States because of the low risk of infection with M. tuberculosis, the variable effectiveness of the vaccine against pulmonary TB, and the vaccine's poten tial interference with tuberculin skin test reactivity.13 BCG vaccination can produce a false-positive reaction to the TST. However, most children vaccinated in infancy show no reaction on subsequent TST testing and less than 10% of vaccinated ch ildren have a TST reaction 10 mm.14 Children who receive BCG after infancy or those who receive more than one BCG immunization are more likely to have a positive TST. Children born in countries with high rates of TB disease are likely to have received BCG immunization in infancy, but they are also more likely to have a positive TST from TB infection than from BCG immunization.15 Generally, interpretation of TST results in BCG recipients is the same as for children who have not received the BCG vaccine. A history of vaccination with BCG should not influence the interpretation of the TST reaction or clinical d ecisions regarding the management of children who are TST pos itive. Two poss ible exceptions are when BCG was given within the last 12 months and when the patient is from a low-incidence co untry.16 All children with a positive TST shou ld be promptly evaluated, regardless of BCG immunization status. Tuberculosis disease shou ld be suspected strongly in any symptomatic child with a positive TST result regardless of history of BCG immunization. TST-positive children from countries where TB is common are likely to be infected with TB and are at risk of developing active TB disease, even if they have been vaccinated with BCG.17 For some children, such as ch ildren recently immunized with BCG vaccine, multiple BCG or ch ildren who immigrated from a cou ntry with a low prevalence of TB, treatment for LTBI may not be indicated. In such cases follow up sh ould include patient education and awareness of the signs and symptoms of tuberculosis disease. NEVADA TUBERCULOSIS PROGRAM MANUAL Revised MAR 2020 Diagnosis and T reatment of LTBI and TB Disease in Children 12.10 Management of Children with a Positive TST or IGRA The most efficient way to pre vent pediatric TB is to evaluate and treat those children exposed to an infectious adult source c ase. 1. ALL infant s, children, and adolesc ents with a newly positive TST or IGRA should promp tly undergo c linical evaluation to rule out active TB disea se. The evaluation sh ould include a history to determine the presence of symptoms of TB disease or coexisting medical conditions that could comp licate medical therapy for LTBI or increase the risk of progression to TB disease; a physical e xamination, and a posterior-anterior (PA) chest radiograph. For children under 5 years of age, a lateral ch est x-ray is also recommended for better visualization of hilar node enlargement. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is defined as M. tuberculosis infection in a person who has a pos itive TST or IGRA test, no physical findings of disease, and chest radiograph findings that are normal or reveal evidence of healed infection (e.g. granulomas or calcification in the lung, hilar lymph nodes, or both). 2. ALL infant s, children, and adolesc ents who have a positive TST or IGRA result but no evidence of TB disea se should prom ptly receive treatment for LTBI. Why treat children with latent TB infection (LTBI)? Children who have LTBI are the reservoir for future TB disease; hence, pediatric LTBI treatment is imperative to prevent TB disease and transmission in the future. Prompt treatment is especially important for children under 5 years of age who are at increased risk of rapid progression to active TB. All infants, ch ildren, a nd adolescents who have a pos itive TST or IGRA result but no e vidence of tuberculosis disease and who never have received antituberculosis therapy should receive treatment to prevent development of disease, unless a specific contraindication exists. NEVADA TUBERCULOSIS PROGRAM MANUAL Revised MAR 2020 Diagnosis and T reatment of LTBI and TB Disease in Children 12.11 Treatment of Latent TB Infection ( LTBI) Do not start treatment for LTBI before ruling out TB disea se. Isoniazid (INH) for 9 months is the traditional regimen for children under 12 years without a known sou rce case or with a source case whose M. tuberculosis isolate is susceptible to INH. Isoniazid can be administered daily, or twice weekly if directly observed therapy (DOT) is utilized . Twice weekly treatment by DOT is an excellent method for promoting adherence to treatment. However, recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of short -course LTBI regimens in children > 2 years of age . The CDC has recently (February 2020) updated its recommended LTBI regimens (see Table 4) and advocat es for short -course treatments, when not contraindicated. Th e regimens are summarized on the CDC's LTBI webpage, https://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/treatment/ltbi.htm , and are reviewed for reco mmendat ion \"Grade\" based on quality of evidence in the publication, \" Guidelines for the Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection: Recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 \"; Sterling TR, Njie G, Zenner D, et al.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.rr6901a1 . Daily rifampin (RIF) for 4 months is a suitable alternative for children with LTBI who have been e xposed to a source case whose isolate is resistant to INH but susc eptible to rifampin, or for those who ca nnot tolerate INH. CDC g uidelines published in 2018 updated the 12 -week INH -Rifapentine (3HP) regimen recommendations to includ e use in children 2 -12 years of age (previously, recommended 12 years of age). This regimen is for isoniazid and rifapentine once weekly by directly o bserved therapy (DOT) recommended , or parental administered s elf-administered therapy (SAT) for 12 weeks.19 The care and treatment of children exposed to a source case with a multidrug-resistant (MDR) M. tuberculosis strain should include co nsultation with an expert in the management of pediatric MDR TB, along with DOT for therapy management. Before initiating therapy, it is important to educate patients and families regarding signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity and other side effects and what to do sh ould side effects be noted. During treatment for LTBI, children should be evaluated monthly to reinforce adh erence, evaluate for toxicities, and assess possible progression to TB disease.

MMWR 2011; 60(48); 1650 For consultation regarding the treatment of LTBI, call the local health authority in your county. Expert consultation with a pediatric TB specialist sh ould be obtained for children judged to be infected with a multidrug-resistant strain of M. tuberculosis or infected with HIV. Children who are at especially high risk for progression to TB disease , and either are suspected of nonadherence or , are on an intermittent (e.g. twice weekly) dosing regimen, should be treated using DOT. This method of treatment is especially appropri ate when a household member is on DOT for TB disease, or the child attends i nstitutions or facilities (schools) where a staff member can obs erve treatment. DOT is highly recommended for 12 - week INH -Rifapentine (3HP) regimen.

The use of INH elixir is discouraged, as it commonly causes d iarrhea and cramping in children. If children have difficulty taking medications, open capsules and crush tablets, and then hide the drugs in soft foods or liquids. Possible foods are maple syrup, peanut butter , spinach baby food, and chocolate whipped cream. Layer the food and drug on a spoon, and teach the child to take the contents of the spoon without chewing. NEVADA TUBERCULOSIS PROGRAM MANUAL Revised MAR 2020 Diagnosis and T reatment of LTBI and TB Disease in Children 12.15 Monitoring Children should be seen in the clinic monthly, and questions should be asked a bout symptoms of toxicity, symptoms of active TB, adherence to therapy, and results of skin testing of family members and other contacts. Antituberculosis drug doses should be adjusted in accordance with the weight of the child. Monthly monitoring of body weight is therefore especially important in pediatric cases with adjustment of doses as children gain weight. Children taking anti-epileptic drugs and either INH or rifampin shou ld be monitored closely because bo th of these drugs can affect the metabo lism a nd serum levels of anti-epileptics. Side Effects a nd Adverse Rea ctions Families shou ld be educated on symptoms of hepatotoxicity, for example, vomiti ng, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, or jaundice, and instructed to stop the therapy and return to the clinic if they note any symptoms which may be co nsistent with drug toxicity. Untoward effects of isoniazid therapy, including se vere hepatitis in otherwise hea lthy infants, children, and adolescents, are rare. Monitoring of liver function is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic children who do n ot have und erlying liver disease and are not taking other hepatotoxic drugs. Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6 ): Routine administration of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is not recommended for all children taking isoniazid. Pyridoxine su pplemen tation is recommended for: infants, children on a milk- and meat-deficient diet, children with nutritional deficiencies, HIV-infected ch ildren, pregnant adolescents, children who experience pa resthes ia while taking isoniazid.27 The recommended dose is 6.25 mg (1/4 of a 25 mg tablet) for infants), 12.5 mg (1/2 of a 25 mg tablet) for toddlers, and 25 mg (1 tablet) for school age children. For infants and small children, the tablet portions can be crushed and placed in an agreeable liquid or s oft food for administration28. NEVADA TUBERCULOSIS PROGRAM MANUAL Revised MAR 2020 Diagnosis and T reatment of LTBI and TB Disease in Children 12.16 Window-Period Prophylaxis Young ch ildren and children with HIV infection and other immunocompromising conditions are more likely to become ill with TB disease if they are infected and more likely to develop se vere forms of TB disease. Because of their increased risk, they are candidates for window-period proph ylaxis, which is treatment for presumptive TB infection during the interval between infection and detectable TB screening test reactivity. The National Tuberculosis Controllers Association (NTCA) and the CDC recommend that the window period be estimated at 8 to 10 weeks after last contact with the infectious source case or 8 to 10 weeks after the infectious source case h as become non-infectious.29 The most efficient way to prevent pediatric TB is to evaluate and treat those children exposed to an infectious adult source case. ALL children and ado lescents exposed to an infectious case of tuberculosis disease should have a TB screening test (TST or IGRA) and an evaluation for tuberculosis disease. A chest radiograph (PA and lateral) shou ld be performed on all exposed children under 5 years of age and all exposed ch ildren with HIV infection or other immunosuppressive cond itions, regardless of their initial TST or IGRA result. The following contacts with initially negative TST results should receive treatment for LTBI (window-period proph ylaxis) after TB disease has been ruled out by clinical e xamination and chest radiograph: 1. Contacts younger than 5 years of age (with highest priority given to those under 3 years) 2. Contacts with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or who are otherwise immunocompromised If a sec ond TST or IGRA test is done 8 to 10 weeks after last exposure is negative (<5 mm induration) and the co ntact is immunocompetent (including immunocompe tent young children) and no longer exposed to infectious TB, treatment for LTBI (window-period proph ylaxis) may be discontinued, and further follow-up is unnecessary. For young infants, less than one year of age consult with a pediatric tuberculosis expert, (Curry International Tuberculosis Center Warmline 877 -390-6682) If the second test is negative but the co ntact is immunocompromised (e.g., with human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection), a full course of therapy for LTBI should be completed.30 If the second TST or IGRA test is positive (5mm or greater induration), a full course of therapy for LTBI should be comp leted. Infants and children on window period proph ylaxis should be c losely monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB disease. Immunocompromised contacts to an infectious TB case, such as HIV - infected contacts, should be given full treatment for LTBI regardless of the TST reaction.31 NEVADA TUBERCULOSIS PROGRAM MANUAL Revised MAR 2020 Diagnosis and T reatment of LTBI and TB Disease in Children 12.17 Diagnosis of T uberculo sis Disease Medical History The symptoms and signs of pulmonary tuberculosis in children are usually minor and are more common in infants and young ch ildren. More than half of infants and children with radiographic evidence of moderate to severe pulmonary tuberculosis have no symptoms or findings and are often only discovered by contact tracing. Nonprodu ctive cough and mild dyspnea are the most common symptoms in infants. Fever, night sweats, anorexia, weight loss or poor weight gain, and irritability may also be noted. It is important to also identify underlying medical conditions, for example HIV infection or other immunosuppressive conditions, that increase risk for progression to active TB. Because most children become infected by inhaling droplet nuclei containing M. tuberculosis bacteria that have been e xpelled by coughing persons with infectious pu lmonary or laryngeal TB, any possible con tacts with adults with confirmed tuberculosis or symptoms of active tuberculosis should be explored. Physical Examination Children with primary pulmonary disease often have radiographic abnormalities but are clinically asymptomatic. The chest x-ray findings often have no correlation with signs and symptoms. Physical examination should include an assessment of vital signs including temperature, respiratory rate, and growth parameters. Tachypnea, localized wheezing, or decreased breath sounds can occur with bronchial obstruction, but respiratory distress is rare. About one-third of children with TB have extrapulmonary disease. Disease of extra-thoracic lymph nodes, especially lymph nodes of the neck (scrofula), is the most common non- pulmonary prese ntation. TB disease can a lso occur in many other parts of the body, including the pleura, pericardium, meninges, abdomen and gastrointestinal and genitourinary systems, skin, the larynx, and bone and joints.

Because the results may be difficult to interpret, especially if there has been inadequate inspiration or over penetration, films should be reviewed by a radiologist experienced in reading pediatric chest radiographs. To increase the chances of discern ing intrathoracic adenopathy, a common radiographic feature of primary pulmonary TB in children, both posterior-anterior (PA) and lateral ch est radiographs are required , especially in children under 5 years of age. A variety of radiograph ic findings can be seen in children with TB disease, ranging from normal to diverse abnormalities, such as lymphadenopathy of the hilar, su bcarinal, paratracheal, or mediastinal nodes; effusion; cavitary lesions; or miliary disease. With primary lung parenchymal lesions may be anywhere. With reactivation TB disease, parenchymal lesions are typically, but certainly not always, in the apical regions.

Usually there has been some response by two months, but even at the end of a satisfactory course of treatment there may be residual lymphadenopathy or scarring. Magnetic resonance (MR) or computed tomography (CT) sca ns are generally not necessary unless there is a questionable abn ormality on the plain film and further definition is required. MR and CT im aging may be very helpful in the evaluation of suspected active Central Nervous System (CNS) disease or b one and joint disease. MR and CT imaging can also be helpful in the evaluation of endobronch ial disease and disease in other sites, such as the intra or extra- thoracic lymph nodes, pericardium and peritoneum.34 Bacteriolog ic Testing The gold standard for diagnosing TB disease in children is isolation of M. tuberculosis by culture from specimens of gastric aspirates, sputum, bronchial washings, pleural fluid, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), urine, other body fluids, or a biopsy specimen. For many children with pulmonary TB, culture confirmation is not needed. Diagnosis is made on the basis of a pos itive TST or IGRA , clinical a nd radiographic findings suggestive of TB, and history of contact with an identified adult source case. The drug-susceptibility test (DST) results from the source cas e's TB isolate can be used to guide the optimal treatment for the ch ild. However, cultures sh ould be obtained from the ch ild if the source patient is unknown or h as a drug-resistant organism a nd if the child is immunocompromis ed or has extrapulmonary TB. Gastric A spirates For infants and young children with suspected pulmonary TB, the best specimen to obtain for culture is an early morning gastric aspirate obtained using a naso-gastric tube before the ch ild arises and before peristalsis empties the stomach of the respiratory secretions swallowed overnight. Three consecutive morning gastric aspirates yield M. tuberculosis in 30% to 50% of cases; the yield from infants is as high as 70%. Curry International Tuberculosis Center has guidelines for the collection of gastric aspirates, available at http://currytbcenter.ucsf.edu/products/produ ct_details.cfm?productID=ONL- 10 Sputum Collect ion For older children collection of spontane ously produc ed or induced sputum is often possible. The comb ination of sputum induction and gastric aspirate has yielded the organism in up to 90% of cases. In older children or adolescents, sputum induction is preferable to bronchoscopy. Broncho scopy The culture yield is lower from bronch oscopy specimens than from properly obtained gas tric aspirates. Most children do not need flexible fiber optic bronchoscopy; but the proced ure may be us eful in diagnosing endobronchial TB and excluding other causes of pulmonary abnormality, particularly in immunocompromis ed children, such as those with HIV infection in whom other o pportunistic infections may coexist with or mimic TB. NEVADA TUBERCULOSIS PROGRAM MANUAL Revised MAR 2020 Diagnosis and T reatment of LTBI and TB Disease in Children 12.20 Treatment of Tubercul osis Basic principl es The goal of treatment is to ach ieve sterilization of the tuberculous lesion in the sh ortest possible time. Achievement of this goal minimizes the possibility of development of resistant organisms. The major problem limiting successful treatment is poor adherence to prescribed treatment regimens. The use of DOT decreases the rates of relapse, treatment failures, a nd drug resistance. Evaluation and treatment of children with TB disease requires a coordinated team approach, including clinicians, public health nurses, and often a social worker and an interpreter. The team sh ould always include a cl inician experienced in the management of pediatric TB. Expert consultation is especially important for any pediatric patient with drug-resistant TB or co-infected with HIV. Successful treatment of a ch ild with TB requires that they swallow each dose of all their medications. All children with TB disease shou ld be treated by directly observed therapy (DOT). Parents, and in general, family members, sh ould not be relied on to supervise DOT. The Nevada TB Program welcomes consultation regarding treatment of pediatric patients with TB. TB Consultation For complicated TB cases, for example, children with multi-drug resistant TB and HIV co-infection, an excellent resource of pediatric TB expertise is the Curry International Tuberculosis Center Warmline h t t p : / / w w w . c u r r y t b c e n t e r . u c s f . e d u / c o n s u l t a t i o n Telephone: 415-502-4700 or 877-390-6682 Treatment Reg imens and Do sages In general, the recommended dr ug-treatment regimens and duration of treatment for children with TB are similar to those for adults. Initial treatment should start with daily dosing by DOT, with four drugs for the initial two-month phase and two drugs for the co ntinuation phase of treatment. If the child or the child's source case is known to have a fully-sensitive TB isolate, it is acceptable to start with a three-drug regimen of isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide. NEVADA TUBERCULOSIS PROGRAM MANUAL Revised MAR 2020 Diagnosis and T reatment of LTBI and TB Disease in Children 12.21 Otherwise, ethambutol is always included in the initial treatment regimen until dr ug sensitivities are known, to minimize the em ergence of drug-resistant strains. The Curry International TB Center has a brochure of helpful tips on administration of TB medications to infants and children. These are listed in Appendix A and are available online at: http://currytbcenter.ucsf.edu/ped iatric_tb/resources.cfm Antituberculosis drug doses should be adjusted in accordance with the weight of the child. Monthly monitoring of body weight is therefore especially important in pediatric cases with adjustment of doses as children gain weight. Duration of Treatment Drug-sensitive pulmonary disea se and hilar adenopathy disea se: After treatment for two months with three or four drugs (ethambutol may be discontinued when it b ecomes known that the ch ild or source case has a fully sensitive TB isolate), treatment is continued with isoniazid and rifampin for a minimum of four additional months. The minimum duration of treatment for fully-sensitive pulmonary TB disease is six months. If the chest radiograph shows a cavitary lesion or lesions and sputum or gastric aspirate specimens remains culture positive after two months of therapy, the duration of therapy should be extended to nine months. And if pyrazinamide is not used in the regimen (in the instance of M. bovis, which is usually resistant to PZA) the treatment is extended to nine months. Drug-sensitive extra-pulmonary TB: Extrapulmonary TB in children is treated with the same regimens as pu lmonary disease, with the exception of CNS TB, dissemi nated/miliary TB, and bone and joint TB, for which the recommended minimum duration of treatment is nine to twelve months. Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis or HIV Co-infection: For the treatment of children proven to have or suspected of having drug-resistant TB or HIV co- infection, consultation with a pediatric TB specialist experienced in the management of drug-resistant TB should be obtained.

Abbreviations: DOT, directly observed therapy; RIF, rifampin. a Other combinations may be appropriate in certain circumstances; additional details are provided in the section \"Recommended T reatment Regimens.\" b When DOT is used, drugs may be given 5 days per week and the necessary number of doses adjusted accordingly. Although there are no studies that compare 5 with 7 daily doses, extensive experience indicates this would be an effective practice. DOT should be used when drugs are administered <7 days per week. c Based on expert opinion, patients with cavitation on in itial chest radiograph and positive cultures at completion of 2 months of therapy should receive a 7 -month (31 -week) continuation phase. d Pyridoxine (vitamin B6), 25 -50 mg/day, is given with INH to all persons at risk of neuropathy (eg, pregnant women; br eastfeeding infants; persons with HIV; patients with diabetes, alcoholism, malnutrition, or chronic renal failure; or patients with advanced age). For patients with peripheral neuropathy, experts reco mmend increasing pyridoxine dose to 100 mg/day. e Altern atively, some US tuberculosis control programs have administered intensive -phase regimens 5 days per week for 15 doses (3 weeks), then twice weekly for 12 doses.

For obese patients (>20% above ideal body weight [ IBW]), dosing based on IBW may be preferred for initial doses. Some clinicians prefer a modified IBW (IBW + [0.40 actual weight - IBW)]) as is done for initial aminoglycoside doses. Because tuberculosis drug dosing for obese patients has not been establis hed, therapeutic drug monitoring may be considered for such patients. b For purposes of this document, adult dosing begins at age 1 5 years or at a weight of >40 kg in younger children. The optimal doses for thrice -weekly therapy in children and adolescents have not been established. Some experts use in adolescents the same doses as recommended for adults, and for younger children the same doses as recommended for twice -weekly therapy. c Higher doses of rifampin, currently as high as 35 mg/kg, are being studied in clinical trials. d Rifabutin dose may need to be adjusted when there is concomitant use of protease inhibitors or nonnucle oside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. e TBTC Study 22 used rifapentine (RPT) dosage of 10 mg/kg in the continuation phase of treatment for active disease [9]. Howeve r, RIFAQUIN and PREVENT TB safely used higher dosages of RPT, administered once weekly [1 64, 210]. Daily doses of 1200 mg RPT are being studied in clinical trials for active tuberculosis disease. f As an approach to avoiding ethambutol (EMB) ocular toxicity, some clinicians use a 3 -drug regimen (INH, rifampin, and pyrazinamide) in the initial 2 months of treatment for children who are HIV -uninfected, have no prior tuberculosis treatment history, are living in an area of low prevalence of drug -resistant tuberculosis, and have no exposure to an individual from an area of high prevalence of drug -resistant tuberculosis. However, because the prevalence of and risk for drug -resistant tuberculosis can be difficult to ascertain, the American Academy of Pediatrics and most experts include EMB Sources: Payam Nahid, Susan E.

Isoniazid is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily through the kidneys. Hepatotoxic effects are rare in children but can be life threatening. In children and ado lescents given recommended doses, peripheral n euritis or seizures caused by inhibition of pyridoxine metabolism are rare, and most do not need pyridoxine su pplemen ts. Pyridoxine is recommended for exclusively breas tfed infants and for children and ado lescents on meat- and milk-deficient diets; children with nutritional deficiencies, including all symptomatic HIV-infected ch ildren; and pregnant and breastfeeding adolescents and women .36 For these infants and children, the recommended dose is 6.25 mg (1/4 of a 25 mg tablet) for infants, 12.5 mg (1/2 of a 25 mg tablet) for toddlers, and 25 mg (1 tablet) for school age ch ildren. For infants and small children, the tablet portions can be crushed and placed in an agreea ble liquid or soft food for administration.37 Rifampin is a bactericidal agent that is absorbed rapidly and pen etrates into body fluids, including CSF. Rifampin is metabolized by the liver and can a lter the pharmacokinetics and serum co ncentrations of many other dr ugs. Hepatotoxic effects, influenza-like symptoms, and pruritus may occur rarely. Rifampin is e xcreted in bile and u rine and can cause orange urine, sweat, and tears and discoloration of soft contact lenses. Rifampin can make oral contraceptives ineffective, so other birth control methods should be adopted when rifampin is administered to sexually active ado lescent women.38 Pyrazinamide attains therape utic CSF concentrations, is detectable in macrophages, is administered orally, and is metabolized by the liver. Administration of pyrazinamide with isoniazid and rifampin allows for 6-month regimens in patients with drug-susceptible tuberculosis. In doses of 30 mg/kg per d ay or less, pyrazinamide se ldom has hepatotoxic effects and is well tolerated by children. Some adolescents and many adults develop arthralgia and hyperuricemia because of inhibition of uric acid excretion. Pyrazinamide must be used with caution in peo ple with underlying liver disease.39 Ethambut ol is well absorbed after oral administration, diffuses well into tissues, and is excreted in urine. However, concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid are low. At 15 mg/kg per d ay, ethambutol is bacteriostatic only, and its primary therapeutic role is to prevent emergence of drug resistance.40 A common question is whether the first-line drug ethambutol (EMB) can be safely administered to children. EMB can ca use retro bulbar neuritis, a side effect that is dose-dependent and renal- function dependent. It manifests as de creased visual acuity or decreased red-green color discrimination and is usually reversible upon d iscontinuation of the drug. Monitoring of vision is recommended monthly in older children and adu lts. Past guidelines have advised a gainst the use of EMB or have advised ca ution when using EMB in children who ca nnot verbalize symptoms of optic neuritis, but recent studies ha ve not found evidence of visual toxicity in young children treated with recommended ethambutol dosing.41 In young children in whom toxicity cannot be monitored use of EMB in a dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg per d ay is acceptable and carries a very low risk of optic neuritis.

Parents and other caregivers should be educated on the TB medications being given to their child and the potential side effects and adverse reactions to watch for and to promptly report if noted while their child is on TB treatment. A baseline comp lete blood co unt with platelet count, chemistry panel with liver function and creatinine, and an HIV screen are recommended for all persons starting treatment for active TB disease. Follow-up liver function testing shou ld be done at least monthly on ch ildren with abn ormal baseline liver function and on children co-infected with HIV; some clinicians routinely monitor liver function on a ll pediatric TB patients. Liver function testing sh ould also be done if a child develops loss of appetite, malaise, jaundice, or other symptoms of possible hep atitis while on TB treatment. For children on a TB treatment regimen that includes ethambutol, baseline and periodic follow- up testing of visual acuity and color vision is recommended for children who are able to do these tests. Antituberculosis drug doses should be adjusted in accordance with the weight of the child. Monthly monitoring of body weight is therefore especially important in pediatric cases with adjustment of doses as children gain weight. Children taking anti-epileptic drugs and either INH or rifampin shou ld be monitored closely because bo th of these drugs can affect the metabo lism a nd serum levels of anti-epileptics. ): Routine administration of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is not recommended for all children taking isoniazid. Pyridoxine su pplemen tation is recommended for: infants children on a milk- and meat-deficient diet children with nutritional deficiencies HIV-infected ch ildren pregnant adolescents children who experience paresthes ia while taking isoniazid42 NEVADA T U B E R C U L O S I S P R O G R A M M A N U A L R e v i s e d MAR 2020 Diagnosis and T reatment of LTBI and TB Disease in Children 12. 30 The recommended dose is 6.25 mg (1/4 of a 25 mg tablet) for infants), 12.5 mg (1/2 of a 25 mg tablet) for toddlers, and 25 mg (1 tablet) for school age children. For infants and small children, the tablet portions can be crushed and placed in an agreeable liquid or s oft food for administration.43 Response to Treatment: In most children, response to treatment is assessed prim arily clinically and by x-ray. In children, weight loss or, more commonly, failure to gain weight adequately is of particular concern and is often one of the first (or only) signs of treatment failure. For children able to produce s putum, follow-up sp utum cultures are helpful, especially if there is a concern of treatment failure. Similarly, follow-up gastric aspirates may be of benefit in infants and young children, es pecially for those with severe or drug resistant TB disease. Completion of Treatment The date of completion of treatment is determined by the total doses administered by DOT. If therapy has been interrupted, the date of completion sh ould be extended. Decisions about the comp letion of treatment should be made in consultation with the Nevada TB Program. See Treatment of Tuberculosis Disease , Chapter 4, of this manual for more information about determining completion of treatment.

Airborne precautions with isolation in a negative pressure room are indicated for (1) children with cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis; (2) children with pos itive smears; (3) children with (4) children with extensive pu lmonary infection; and (5) children with congenital tuberculosis undergoing proced that involve the oroph aryngeal airway (e.g., endotracheal intubation); until effective therapy has been initiated, sputum smears demonstrate a diminishing number of organisms, and cough is abating. 44 The major co ncern in h ospital infection control relates to adult household members and co ntacts who may be the source case to a child with TB. Household members and other co ntacts should be managed with tuberculosis precauti ons when visiting until they are demonstrated not to have infectious tuberculosis. Nonadherent household contacts should be excluded from hospital visitation until their evaluation is complete and tuberculosis disease is excluded or treatment has rendered source cases noninfectious. 45 Child Care and School s Children with tuberculosis disease can attend school or child care if they are receiving therapy. They can return to regular activities as soon as effective therapy has been institu ted, adherence to therapy has been documen ted, and clinical symptoms have diminished subs tantially.46 Source Ca se Investigations A diagnosis of LTBI or tuberculosis disease in a young ch ild is a sentinel event representing recent transmission of M. tuberculosis in the community. Health care providers should assist state and local h ealth department personnel in the sea rch for a source case and others infected by the so urce case. Members of the household, such as relatives, babysitters, au pairs, boarder s, domestic workers, and frequent visitors or other adults, such as child care providers and teachers with whom the ch ild has frequent contact, potentially are source cases. See Contact Investigation, Chapter 8, of this manual for more information about source case investigations. In children less than 5 years of age, LTBI, in addition to TB disease, is a reportable condition under Nevada state law. Please contact your local health department if you require assistance reporting LTBI in children less than 5 years of age. Prompt repor ting assists health departments in initiating effective source case investigations.

Prepare the family for the challenge and encourage them not to be discouraged if it takes a week or two to get into a comfortable routine . It is better to get the child into a good pattern than to set up a po wer struggle. All children with tuberculosis disease (TB) require treatment with directly observed therapy (DOT). With DOT, a hea lthcare worker, teacher, or other non-family member observes administration of the TB drugs. Drugs should be taken a ll at once, not throughout the day, and they should be given close to the same time each da y. Methods to deliver the drug s: 1) Pills and capsu les taken intact or in halves: This is the easiest way! Tip the head b ack to swallow pills and tip the head forward to swallow capsules. If the child can swallow capsules, but not tablets, crush the pills and place the powder in commercially available empty capsules. 2) Pills fragmented (with a knife or commercial pill cutter) or crushed (by commercial pill crusher, mortar and pestle, spoon against sp oon or bowl); capsules can be opened. a) Put a thin layer of soft food onto a spoo n. Place the pill fragmen ts or powder on top of the food layer and top with more yummy food. Give the child the dose of medication in this \"sandwich.\" Teach them to swallow it without chewing by practicing without the medication in place first. Chocolate sauce, pudding, fudge sauce, ice cream, etc. Jelly or marmalade (the texture hides the powder granularity) Apple sauce or berry-sauce (better to hide the red rifampin color) Nutella or peanut butter Cream ch eese or chili con carne The crushed pills have a strong flavor; small fragmen ts of the pill taste better. OR b) Suspend in a S MALL AMOUNT of liquid. Water is best. Sugary liquids may interact with INH and should be avoided. Dispense with: Syringe (it is difficult to get the pulverized INH through regular tip syringe; other drugs crush finer and solubilize better) Medicine dropp er with larger tip; available at many pharmacies Baby bottle (may need to make nipple hole larger) Special Rx MediBottle - with internal sleeve for syringe; available at many pharmacies. Pulverized INH is very difficult to get through this syringe. Give the other meds with this bottle and then give INH separately or by the liquid product if it is tolerated by the baby.

The large osmotic load is poorly tolerated by most children, but may be better tolerated by babies. Other TB medications are not co mmercially available as liquids. Medications may be suspended by local pharmacies but the stability and homogeneity are not guaranteed.
