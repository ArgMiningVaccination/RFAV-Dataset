When you have cancer, you want to do all you can to treat the cancer and feel better. Therefore, many people turn to integrative medicine. Integrative medicine (IM) refers to any type of medical practice or product that is not standard care. It includes things like acupuncture, meditation, and massage. Standard care for cancer includes surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and biological therapy. Integrative medicine is complementary care used alongside standard care. It combines the best of both types of care. IM encourages shared decision making between providers and patients. This is when patients take an active role in their care as a partner with their provider. Many types of IM have been studied. Those that may help people with cancer include: Dr. Ravello will assist individuals in incorporating nutrient-dense foods into their diet, provide herbal supplements, and incorporate therapy to help with symptoms from standard cancer treatment you may be receiving.
