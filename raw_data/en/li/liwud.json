RISE Health May 11th 2020 Infection Prevention and Control (IPAC) Rapid COVID -19 Assessment MITRA INFECTION PREVE NTION CONSULTANTS, Inc. Page 1 of 9 RISE Health is a multidisciplin ary collaborative health and wellness clinic which has been in operation since March 2014. Services offered at the clinic include : Physiotherapy, Massage Therapy, Chiropractic and Naturopathic Medicine , Clinical Counselling, Holistic Nutrition, Acupuncture., Orthotics, Pilates and Restorative Yoga. There are approx imately 27 practitioners and 11 administration staff at RISE Health. This second 'Infection Prevention Assessment' was carried out over a 1-hour period on May 11th 2020 when the clinic was closed . The assessment was initiated by the COVID -19 situation and preparations to re-open the clinic after it had been closed for 2 months , except for telehealth . While the focus of this assessment is on implementing measures to stop the spread of COVID -19, the Infection Prevention and Control (IPAC) best practice recommendations in this report apply to other communicable diseases and antimicrobial resistant organisms that are transmit ted via the contact and/or droplet route. This report is broken down into several sections: 1. IPAC PLUSES (or factors that IPAC risks of transmission / contamination ) require no changes, only monitoring and maintenance, as RISE Health is competently carrying out current IPAC best practice standards . NB: Changes will be required when /if standards change. 2. IPAC IMPROVEMENT AREAS (or factors that IPAC risks of transmission /contamination ) require change or improvement work to meet IPAC current best practice standards. 3. RECOMM ENDATIONS (or practices to IPAC risks of transmission /contamination) include suggestions of how to meet current IPAC best practice standards , or embe d IPAC processes into everyday work so they become a habit and more easily achieved. It should be noted that: o No detailed comments can be made about operational practices that were not observed (or fully observed) during this assessment (for example, environmental cleaning practices ) o The recommendations in this report are guided by current IPAC best practice standards, and current COVID -19 information, the sources of which can be found in the reference section. Where best practic e standards and IPAC principles can be used to direct IPAC practices in a clinical setting, implementation /operationalization of these standards is the responsibility of RISE Health and its employees ; this may influence the effectiveness of IPAC best practices.

Page 4 of 9 IPAC BEST PRACTICE S TO PREVENT TRANSMISSION OF COVID -19 1. Clients should: a. Bring minimal personal belongings to their appointments , such as coats, phones etc. (i.e., only what is necessary ) b. Clean their hands when entering/ leaving the clinic and before /after they use shared gym equipment or when they are soiled c. Be asked to rebook their appoint ment if they are sick (even if they have a mild respiratory , or other acute illness) d. Be made aware of the new clinic guidelines to prevent transmission of infections before they arrive for their appointment e. Be screened by phone when they book an appointment and, on the day of their visit. Asymptomatic clients: Enter RISE when called carry out HH be accompanied to the treatment room after treatment , be accompanied to the exit (Note: clients can wear a mask if they prefer to - either their own clean cloth mask, or one from RISE if supplies are available) 2. Staff should: a. Be provided with IPAC training to support mitigating the risks of transmission (i.e., HH, Cleaning/Disinfecting, Safe PPE use) b. Space appointment s to ensure no overlap and enough time to effectively clean/disinfect equipment/room between clients c. Self-Monitor their own symptoms daily and NOT come to work if they have signs & symptoms of a respiratory illness/communicable disease. Staff should arrange to be tested for COVID -19 where appropriate by calling 811 d. Minimize personal items brought to work and clean/disinfect these items between clients, when contaminated, and at end of the work day, (i.e., phones , laptops , stethoscopes ) e. Clean their hands when entering/ leaving RISH Health, between clients, before/after caring for a client, between a 'dirty' to 'clean' procedure on the same client (i.e., manipulation to dry needling), and when contaminated f. Keep their nails short with no nail polish/false nails, and wear no hand/wrist jewelry to support effective hand hygiene g. Wear dedicated work clothes/shoes, change at work if possible (transport in a plastic or cleanable bag), and launder at the end of a work day (If staff don't change at work, they should be advised to not stop at a public place on their way home) h. Wear work clothing that decreases the risk of contamination (i.e., sleeves that can be pulled up to the elbows to avoid contamination while carrying out a procedure or performing hand hygiene, water -resistant shoes that can be cleaned daily) i. Bring food/water in a labelled container /bottle which can be cleaned on the outside before storing in shared space/fridge j. Avoid sharing food k. Maintain their health /immune status (exercise, eat well, sleep etc.) l. Know their vaccine status and keep their vaccines up-to-date RISE Health May 11th 2020 Infection Prevention and Control (IPAC) Rapid COVID -19 Assessment MITRA INFECTION PREVE NTION CONSULTANTS, Inc. Page 5 of 9 KEY IPAC BEST PRACTICES FOR HAND HYGIENE, GLOVE USE AND CLEANING Hand Hygiene is one of the most effective practices to stop the transmission of pathogens o HH can be carried out with ABHR or Soap and Water if your hands are visibly soiled. Friction is important to remove pathogens. o Effective HH involves cleaning all areas/surfaces of the hands and wrists in the correct moments to stop transmission and the spread of pathogens, and decrease contamination of the environment, equipment and items o HH should be carried out by anyone entering the clinic (staff, clients, companions, trades people etc.). o HH should be performed before and after using any shared equipment/items . This not only decreases the bioburden on equipment/items, but also prevents transmission of infections. Hand Hygiene and Appropriate Glove Use o HH should be carried out BEFORE you take a pair of gloves out of a glove box to avoid contaminating the gloves in the box, and the outside surface of the gloves you are putting on o Gloves should ONLY be worn if there is a risk of blood and/or body fluid exposure, and should NEVER replace HH o Gloves should ALWAYS be changed between clients and when leaving the area you are using them in (to avoid spreading pathogens to the environment, transmitting infections or self-contaminating) RISE Health May 11th 2020 Infection Prevention and Control (IPAC) Rapid COVID -19 Assessment MITRA INFECTION PREVE NTION CONSULTANTS, Inc. Page 6 of 9 KEY IPAC BEST PRACTICES FOR HAND HYGIENE, GLOVE USE AND CLEANING IPAC Best Practices for Cleaning/Disinfecting o Cleaning/Disinfection of clinic spaces and equipment should follow an established cleaning proces s that outlines what, when (between clients, daily, monthly), who (trained healthcare cleaners and staff), where and how (using Health Canada approved healthcare grade disinfectants with a Drug Identification Number (DIN) , microfibre cloths, and following contact 'wet' times and manufacturer's instruction s) to clean. Without a process or guidelines things may be missed, or not cleaned adequately , and the risk of transmission increases. It is also important to have a procedure to identify what has been cleaned, and how to store an item so it does not become contaminated before use. In addition, a plan should be made to assess, and retire or repair, damaged fixtures, fittings, items, and equipment that can no longer be cleaned effectively . o Clean equipment/items should be stored in a clean, low traffic area, or in a covered container, to prevent re-contamination after cleaning. Clean again before use if not used frequently o High touch office equipment/items should be cleaned on a daily basis and between staff o Treatment Rooms should only contain necessary supplies to avoid contamination of items and enable effective and efficient cleaning/disinfecting practices between clients and at the end of the day (less clutter easier and faster to clean/disinfect) o Avoid bringing food, drinks or personal items into a clinical room to minimize the risk of self-contamination and to cleaning time o All laptops/monitors/phone screens/keyb oards etc. that are used in exam rooms should be cleaned on a daily basis, when contaminated or between rooms and/or clients (follow manufacturer 's instructions for cleaning/disinfecting screens , and electronic/computer equipment ) RISE Health May 11th 2020 Infection Prevention and Control (IPAC) Rapid COVID -19 Assessment MITRA INFECTION PREVE NTION CONSULTANTS, Inc.
