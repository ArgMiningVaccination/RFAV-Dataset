Try occasional baths with dried Calendula for feeling better about yourself. . Emotional Healing with Calendula Calendula can help us to recognize and understand our fears, especially surrounding relationships. It can help us to understand ourselves better, accepting what we cannot change about ourselves and lending the courage and determination needed to change what we can. This is an herb of love, including self-love. It reminds you that, in order to love another fully and completely, you must love and appreciate yourself first. Calendula is also an herb/flower of healing, courage, and forgiveness. It brings one the energies of patience, acceptance, and understanding needed to resolve conflicts, overcome obstacles, and release negativity from within our hearts. It is also an excellent herb for encouraging thoughtful, productive communication. It helps us to cultivate empathy and a receptive, openminded attitude. Just like how it can physically heal wounds with its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, it can also heal emotional wounds. Its energies encourage you to let go of what is no longer serving and open yourself up to new and magical possibilities. Calendula can also protect one from the negative intentions of others. Carry calendula flowers on your person to shield you from negative forces and spirits or intentions that may intend to bring you harm. Calendula for Chakra Healing Calendula is used to balance the Solar Plexus chakra. The Solar Plexus is the energy distribution center, the first of the chakras of relationships. This chakra is located between the ribcage and navel. It controls the immune system and digestive systems. When in balance physically you have strength to fight infections, are free of allergic reactions, and are able to use the nutrients you ingest. When it is out of balance physically you will have low tolerance to infection, suffer from hormone disorders, or have low tolerance for many foods. Spiritually, when the solar plexus is in balance you are free to interpret the world through your own thoughts and emotions and not live in fear of violating the dictums of others. When the solar plexus is out of balance spiritually you will feel fear: fear of the displeasure of others, and disappointing others, or fear of subordinating your life and pleasures to the will of others. Color Energy of Calendula The color ray for Calendula is Orange. The orange color ray brings in vibrations of happiness, confidence, optimism, and togetherness. It is also a happy color that brings us joy and can help us overcome grief. Orange is also the color of sex and physical pleasure. Orange crystals can bring things and people together. They integrate the parts of our communal lives. In lighter shades, orange is the color ray of friendship. It is color of finding new friends, keeping in touch with lifetime friends, and finding ways to keep friendships alive. Light orange is the color ray of companionship, loyalty, charm, encouragement, praise, sharing, and affection. It is a very powerful ray, and herbs that possess it are particularly valuable. | | Notes from the Masters In our yard, the tomato plants are protected and enhanced by Calendula. These both protect from harmful insects, but bring a nice energy of exuberance that we feel enhances the zest of the tomatos. Angels Associated with Calendula Calendula is associated with the angel, Chazaqiel, Master of the 11th tarot card, \"Justice.\" His name means \"cloud of God\", which is fitting considering he was the angel who taught man about the clouds (meteorology). Calendula is also associated with Phorlach, Master of the 21st tarot card, \"The World\" and \"angel of the earth.\" He helps the archangel Uriel complete his work as the angel of repentance.

Calendula and the Goddess Calendula is associated with the deities Oshun, Mary, Xochiquetzal (Aztec Goddess), and Santa Muerte. Oshun is the daughter of Yemaya the Sea Goddess and the God Obatala. She lives in the Ogun River in Nigeria. However, legends say you can find her in all streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds of the earth. She represents fertility, prosperity, nourishment, purity, love, and healing. Oshun is believed to be the protector and provider of the Yoruba people. She cares for the poor, the sick, and orphans. She also cares for the birds of the air and the fish of the sea. Many images portray Oshun as a beautiful mermaid. She is traditionally attractive and desirable, but also tends to be vain, indulgent, and somewhat superficial. It is said, she cannot help but admire herself when passing a surface of a freshwater pool. She is fascinated with pretty, shiny things and loves anything that is luxurious. Legends say she is a major fan of sensual fragrances, such as amber, patchouli, and frankincense. She also enjoys sweet foods of all kinds, especially honey. The Virgin Mary, venerated in Christian theology, is the mother of Jesus and is extolled as \"the first believer\". As the \"first Christian\", she is the one in whom the humanity of the church was representatively embodied. Mary represents social justice, where the poor are exalted and the powerful overthrown. She is a patron saint of all human beings, especially mothers and young children. Mary symbolizes purity, faithfulness, devotion, and humility. Xochiquetzal is the Aztec Goddess of Love, Beauty, Sexuality, Art, and Crafts. She was the wife of the rain god, Tlaloc. Her name translates as xochi meaning \"flower\" and quetzal meaning \"feather.\" In specific, the bluish-green feathers of the quetzal bird. She is often depicted as a young woman with the quetzal bird and an abundance of flowers. She is portrayed in folklore as a woman who enjoyed luxury, sensual and sexual pleasure, music, and dancing. In her role as the Goddess of Love and Fertility, she had the power to cast love spells. She could absolve people of misdeeds, particularly those of a sexual nature. As the Goddess of arts of crafts, she inspired artisans to create objects of beauty and originality that also served a practical purpose in their culture. These products could be used for textiles, metalwork, and pottery. Santa Muerte is the goddess of death in folk Catholicism and Mexican Neopaganism. Also known as \"Our Lady of the Holy Death,\" she is depicted in traditional Mexican female attire along with a skull mask and the flags of the dead draped across her shoulders.(Flags are often placed over the corpses prepared for cremation.) She is the goddess of the dead and children, and is also the patron goddess of the Day of the Dead, or Dia de los Muertos. Santa Muerte is not only the goddess of Death, but the personification of Death itself. She is associated with healing, protection, financial wellbeing, and assurance of a path to the afterlife. Devotees pray to Santa Muerte for healing, success, and love, as well as for revenge against one's enemies. A traditional Santa Muerte altar consists of offerings of food, cigars, candles, and other small items. Owl figurines are often placed at Santa Muerte's feet to symbolize wisdom and feminine power. Candles are often left on her altar in the symbolic color of what the devotee wishes to pray for (such as a green candle for success or a red candle for love). | | Notes from the Masters I never new that calendula was a flower related to marigolds!

Any type of union requires that we not sacrifice our individuality.\" (8) Lore and Legends of Calendula Europeans and early American colonists relied on calendula's sunny disposition and gentle immune boosting properties for protection against the damp, cold of winter.

Ancient Egyptians used calendula to rejuvenate their skin. The Greeks and Romans used it as a culinary garnish.

Bathing in a calendula infusion was thought to give one a healthy, sunny glow that would draw admiration and respect from one's community.

If they did, they would be free. If they didn't do it, it was a sign of his infidelity. by Nicole Farmer Nicole is a Certified Crystal Master, Crystal Herb Master, and Master of the Tarot.
