The call-\u00adleLer, sent separately, invi#ng you to par#cipate in the interviews carries details on the dates, reimbursements and travel to NCBS. This handbook is an aLempt to assist you with the experience of the selec#on process. The ini#al sec#ons should familiarize you with the actual interview process and would also be meaningful to students eventually joining the program. We also include a sec#on where the Faculty at NCBS provide an overview of their research programs. We encourage you all to read this sec#on before you arrive on the campus for the interviews. Addi#onal informa#on on all laboratories and the programs on oer are available on the NCBS website www.ncbs.res.in We hope that the NCBS experience will be enriching for you and look forward to seeing you later in May.

PhD & Int-\u00adPhD programs NCBS oers a graduate program leading to the award of a PhD degree to students who hold a Masters degree in a Basic Science or a Bachelors degree in an Applied Science such as Medicine, Engineering etc. The Integrated PhD program seeks students with an excellent academic record at the B.Sc. level, strongly mo#vated to pursue a career in research. The Integrated Biology (iBio) and Theore#cal Studies programs at NCBS provides a s#mula#ng environment for students with backgrounds in physics, chemistry and mathema#cs to apply their knowledge to understanding concepts in biology. Students who are interested in iBio research projects must rst be accepted into the PhD or integrated-\u00adPhD program at NCBS through the standard applica#on procedure. In all aforemen#oned programs, students register for a PhD at the TIFR Deemed University typically 1.5-\u00ad2 years from the date of joining, a[er mee#ng course requirements and qualifying a comprehensive examina#on. M. Sc by Research: A very small number of students featuring on the wait list of the Integrated PhD selec#on interview may be appointed to this program with salary support on PI grants. The MSc in Wildlife & Conserva#on program is oered only at NCBS and selec#ons are made based on a separate test and interview process. The next selec#ons for this program will be in 2014 2. Selec#on Process Candidates are invited to apply in response to adver#sements appearing in na#onal newspapers and magazines in August/September every year. Candidates short-\u00adlisted on the basis of their performance in a wriLen test, academic record and leLers of evalua#on are interviewed for admission. NCBS sends out an applica#on package to students who qualify the TIFR entrance test for Biology, Physics or Chemistry. Performance in the wriLen test, together with the informa#on requested in the applica#on package is used to short-\u00adlist candidates for interviews at Bangalore. Interviews for the PhD/Int-\u00adPhD programs at NCBS typically comprise two rounds. There is some overlap in the list of candidates invited to interview at DBS or NCBS and it is possible that some candidates are oered admission in both centres. Candidates are however expected to accept the oer at only one centre . GS-\u00ad2013 Interviews 3. Interviews In the rst round, interview panels will typically comprise 3-\u00ad4 members of the faculty. Some commiLees include a minimum of one or two specialists in the areas of Physics or Chemistry. In this round all candidates should expect to be ques#oned on their basic understanding of Biology, Chemistry or Physics as well as quan#ta#ve and reasoning skills. The commiLee will probe your understanding of concepts taught in high school and at the undergraduate level. Please do not prepare for the interviews by memorizing material! All students are interviewed in this round, which is typically completed in one day and may some#mes extend into the morning of the second day. Based on performance in the rst round, students are short-\u00adlisted for the second round of the interview process. This list of candidates short-\u00adlisted for the second round will be posted by 12 noon on the second day or earlier. Lists are drawn up only a[er all rst round interviews are completed. In the second round, interview panels comprise 4-\u00ad5 members and again some commiLees will have greater representa#on of faculty with core exper#se in areas of Chemistry or Physics. This interview may typically extend from 30-\u00ad45 minutes and tests for more in-\u00addepth understanding and the ability to apply the knowledge of an area of special interest to the candidate. Typically the statement of purpose in the applica#on package is used as a basis of ques#oning. However, candidates have to be prepared for ques#ons that have been taught at a more advanced level in special papers or via projects etc. In previous years, ques#ons have also been based on original research ar#cles that were distributed to all candidates prior to the interviews. Candidates uncomfortable or unable to handle ques4ons in a par4cular area must indicate this to the commi6ee immediately. Marks are not deducted for such requests and there is enough diversity in the panels to allow another member to ini4ate a new line of ques4ons . GS-\u00ad2013 Interviews The nal list of selected candidates, drawn up in consulta#on with Chairpersons of the commiLees and based on the performance in both rounds of interviews, will be announced late in the evening of the third day. Waitlisted candidates : Students on the wait-\u00adlist if supported by external funding from the CSIR, ICMR or DBT can join the PhD program if sponsored by a laboratory at NCBS. Alterna#vely, a student on the wait-\u00adlist may also join the graduate program with salary support from the Principal Inves#gator 's [PI] grant. Admission and con#nua#on on the graduate program in both situa#ons is con#ngent on associa#on with the PIs laboratory. This op#on is not available to students short-\u00adlisted on the Integrated PhD program. Faculty at NCBS will post informa#on regarding the availability of grants on the days of the PhD Interviews. Note: Please report at NCBS by 8.30AM on the rst day of the interviews. There is a short session on the morning of the rst day to orient you to the selecKon process and assign students to various panels. NCBS student volunteers who guide you through the interviews will be also be assigned in this session. GS-\u00ad2013 Interviews Overseas Applica#ons NCBS invites applica#ons from students who enrolled in Colleges and University outside the Indian Subcon#nent for their undergraduate studies.

Small RNAs are the key molecules resul#ng from RNA silencing pathways and they regulate both transcrip#on and transla#on with the help of their protein partners. Small RNAs are also important factors in ini#a#ng and maintaining heritable changes in gene expression without changes in DNA sequence (called 'epigene#cs'). Small RNAs and epigenome m o d i c a # o n s i m p a c t e v e r y a s p e c t o f e u k a r y o # c development and disease. Contribu#on of individual small RNAs and epigene#c varia#ons in phenotypes of plants are well documented but we really do not know how they work. We are interested in understanding the pathways that generate small RNAs and epigenome modica#ons to be able to use them eec#vely in plants. Our laboratory uses various biochemical, gene#c, bioinforma#c and whole-\u00adgenome approaches in a wide variety of plants. We use cauliflower and wheatgerm to isolate na#ve protein complexes that generate small RNAs to iden#fy partner proteins to help us understand how they bring about changes in transcrip#on and transla#on. We also use rice and its wild rela#ves to prole RNAs and look for varia#ons in as DNA methyla#on and histone modica#ons) using whole-\u00adgenome techniques. The idea is not only to generate ne map of genomic regions that show epigene#c and small RNA varia#ons, but also to understand what contribu#on they have towards plant phenotypes and to understand how they are inherited. Once the role of a small RNA/epigenome modica#on for a given phenotype is iden#ed, they can be introduced to plants through transcrip#onal gene silencing technology that relies on viruses to alter the epigenome . Our approach should facilitate us to generate crop plants with specic, useful and predictable phenotypes. Selected Publica#ons Padubidri Patel, Donna ( 2 0 1 2 ) .

Honeybees provide the opportunity to study mechanisms of behavior at the level of the individual and the level of the social organiza#on. Moreover, honeybees are one of the few animal model systems to study the interac#on between individual behavior and social organiza#on. We are able to manipulate the social structure and analyze its eects on the individual's behavior, brain physiology, and brain gene regula#on. So far, most behavioral and neurobiological research on honeybees focused on the European-\u00ad African species Apis mellifera , unfortunately neglec#ng the variability in social organiza#on and individual behavior among honeybee species. Honeybee species par#cularly vary in colony organiza#on, worker ac#vity and longevity, pheromone communica#on and dance language communica#on. A special focus of my lab will be research on Asian honeybee species na#ve to India: Apis florea (the red dwarf honeybee), Apis dorsata (the giant honeybee), and Apis cerana (one of the Asian cavity nes#ng honeybees). The genomes of all three species are currently sequenced which will open the possibility to analyze the molecular underpinnings of behavioral dierences and the evolu#on of these behaviors. In addi#on to studies on honeybee behavior, I plan to expand my research on Drosophila. Currently, I am developing lab assays that can be performed with honeybees and flies. The neurogene#c tools available for Drosophila allow iden#fying neural circuitries involved in specic behaviors, and the hope is that Drosophila can help to iden#fy neural circuits involved in honeybee behavior.

Quan#ta#ve reveal brain pep#de signatures of of adaptaKon Adapta#on to various ecological factors has been an important force in the evolu#on of the amazing array of species on earth. However, we are only beginning to address some key ques#ons about adapta#on. How do ecological condi#ons and gene#c factors determine the basis and dynamics of adapta#on? At the molecular level, what is the nature of selec#on ac#ng on genome structure and composi#on genomic characteris#cs aect adapta#on in turn? In previous work, I've shown that the gene#c diversity of laboratory beetle popula#ons can profoundly alter compe##on, popula#on size and stability, and adapta#on to new habitats. In later work, I found that synonymous muta#ons in enzyme-\u00adcoding genes could have surprisingly large eects on bacterial tness, although the bacteria quickly recover tness via small muta#ons of large eect. In our new lab at NCBS we aim to integrate concepts in molecular evolu#on, ecology, and macroevolu#on using insect and bacterial systems. For instance, we are analyzing the gene#c popula#on structure and varia#on in tness components of Tribolium beetle popula#ons across India to understand the links between genotype and phenotype in a generalist species. In another project, we are manipula#ng genomic features such as tRNA gene content and codon usage in bacteria to test their impact on bacterial tness. For various other projects we use phylogene#c compara#ve and bioinforma#cs methods to test signals of long-\u00adterm selec#on on bacterial genomes. Together, these analyses will help us understand how ecological and gene#c characteris#cs interact to influence adapta#on and evolu#on.

Eects of founding gene#c varia#on EvoluKon and organizaKon of biological diversity Research in my lab is aimed at understanding the evolu#on and organiza#on of biological diversity on earth. As a lab, we study biodiversity in an interdisciplinary manner, with our scien#c ques#ons spanning the elds from community and popula#on ecology to evolu#onary gene#cs, and methods ranging from behavioral experiments to phylogene#c inference, theore#cal modeling, and molecular and developmental gene#c experiments. Our work addesses aspects of the origin of species, morphological diversica#on, and ecological and molecular gene#c bases of sex-\u00adlimited and polymorphic traits. We try to integrate the elds of popula#on biology, natural selec#on theory and molecular gene#cs, which serves to conceptually unify the biological sciences. We primarily use two systems as microcosms to study biodiversity. The rst system is Batesian mimicry, which is a phenomenon whereby unprotected prey species (called \"mimics\") gain protec#on from predators by mimicking toxic or otherwise protected species (called \"models\"). Predators learn to avoid models based on prior experience, and subsequently avoid ea#ng mimics due to misiden#ca#on. Hundreds of mime#c buLerfly species are known from tropical forests. There is tremendous varia#on in the nature of Batesian mimicry: mimicry can be sexually monomorphic, polymorphic or sex-\u00adlimited within and across species. Our work aims to understand the selec#ve pressures that favor such varia#on in mimicry, and uncover the gene#c basis of color paLern varia#on. We mainly use phylogene#c methods, ecological observa#ons and molecular gene#c tools in this part of our research. Our second system is Indian buLerflies, which oer many opportuni#es to study biogeography, community ecology, popula#on biology and conserva#on issues. Indian buLerflies are excellent to study various interes#ng phenomena, including large-\u00adscale migra#ons and seasonal polyphenism. Due to their considerable diversity and endmism in the Indian Subcon#nent, they are also outstanding subjects to study origins of species, and biogeography and phylogeography in the Oriental Region. Finally, due to increasing human pressures, the persistence of biodiversity is under threat, and buLerflies are no excep#on. The problems of a very large human popula#on in a developing country, combined with a serious administra#ve commitment to conserva#on and strong na#onal conserva#on legisla#on, makes India a unique country to understand scien#c and social issues related to the preserva#on of biodiversity. Thus, the long-\u00adterm goal of our \"Biodiversity Lab\" is to study mechanisms that facilitate morphological diversica#on, processes that shape the origins and dispersion of species, and the means to preserve biodiversity.

Krushnamegh Kunte Control and Morphology Lab Our lab is interested in the interac#on between control and morphology in animals and machines. We combine biological, mechanical, and mathema#cal methods to study how animals control their limbs and body to interact with the surrounding. My lab studies the interac#on between control and morphology in animals and machines. Why do animals o[en outperform their robo#c counterparts in terms of robustness and versa#lity of motor behaviour? Have animals nely-\u00adtuned their morphology through evolu#on in order to achieve the robustness one associates with biology? How do we extract design and control principles for understanding biomechanical func#on, the diagnosis and treatment of disease and also for improving the state of robo#cs and prosthe#cs? Theore#cal eorts drive the design of our experiments and our experimental outcomes o[en call for new theore#cal approaches to analyze and interpret the results. Current projects in the lab span several aspects of human motor behaviour, including locomo#on, throwing and grasping. What is the role of the foot and the leg in maintaining stability when people run on uneven terrains? Which morphological features of the human body, dierent from other primates, allow us to throw at accurately very high speeds? Our work on how humans use their nger#ps in ne manipula#on seeks to understand how the anatomical layout and physiological proper#es of muscles and tendons help in dexterous manipula#on. In all of these projects, we seek to understand how evolu#on has shaped our morphology and in turn, how that aects the choice of motor control strategies that our nervous system uses.

Venkadesan and gene regulaKon and adaptaKon Bacteria are the most numerous among free-\u00adliving life on earth. They adapt to their environment, including a variety of stresses, by changes to their gene#c material and / or altera#ons in the nature and amounts of proteins produced. Our lab is interested in studying these aspects of bacterial biology using a combina#on of molecular and 'genomic' experiments and computa#onal analysis. In par#cular, we study the following: 1. the role of global transcrip#onal regulators in influencing growth physiology of E. coli 2. gene#c and transcrip#onal adapta#on of E. coli popula#ons to chemical and nutrient stresses 3. mechanisms regula#ng horizontal gene transfer Recent GM, Luscombe NM, Seshasayee A S N .

Aswin Sai Narain Seshasayee Life and death decisions in biological systems I'm interested in how biological cells, organisms and popula#ons acquire and process informa#on, and integrate dierent pieces of informa#on to make decisions. I use computa#onal modeling and theore#cal analyses to understand the role of feedback mechanisms in regulatory networks that process informa#on. 1. Bacteriophage lysis-\u00adlysogeny decision. Temperate bacteriophage are amongst the simplest organisms that could be said to make a developmental decision. Upon infec#ng a bacterium, temperate phage enter either the ly#c pathway, where they replicate rapidly and eventually lyse the host, or the lysogenic pathway, where they insert their DNA into the genome of the cell and lay dormant. I'm interested in understanding how informa#on such as the number of infec#ng phage, bacterial growth rate, bacterial density, etc., is used to bias the lysis-\u00adlysogeny decision. 2. Metabolism in prokaryotes. Sugar uptake and metabolism networks in bacteria are ideal systems to study feedback. Typically, they have two entangled feedback loops, a posi#ve one regula#ng transport and a nega#ve one regula#ng metabolism. In contrast, iron metabolism in several bacteria has at its core two nega#ve feedback loops. I'm interes#ng in understanding the dynamics of mul#ple entangled loops by inves#ga#ng compara#ve models of metabolic regula#on in E. coli, H. pylori and Y. pes#s , and mapping the transi#on to sta#onary phase in bacteria growing on single carbon sources. More generally, I would like to uncover principles that can be used to predict the behaviour of combina#ons of feedback loops. Selected Publica#ons Semsey , S & Krishna, S.

To generate movement, skeletal muscles need to be contracted in precisely coordinated paLerns. Neural circuits control the spa#al and temporal paLern of skeletal muscle contrac#ons. Our lab is interested in understanding the hierarchy, mechanisms and development of neural circuits that generate movement. We use zebrash, a small fresh water tropical sh endemic to the Ganges, as our model system. The embryonic and larval stages of these sh are transparent allowing for direct visual observa#on of developing internal organs including the brain. We employ a suite of techniques to tease out the circuitry responsible for genera#ng swimming in developing and more mature zebrash. These include whole-\u00adcell patch clamping, calcium imaging, high-\u00adspeed videography and confocal and two-\u00adphoton microscopy. Using these cu\u007fng edge tools and technologies, we hope to throw light on the development of neural circuits and the neural basis of locomo#on.

My group is interested in the long #mescale mo#ons of proteins, in par#cular, large-\u00adscale conforma#onal transi#ons and folding. We use models based solely on the folded structure of the protein to access such long #mescales. We use structural (e.g. the -\u00adtrefoil fold) families of proteins, to understand how protein func#on aects protein folding. In this context, we have begun computa#onal and experimental protein design of func#on-\u00adless proteins. We study several large proteins (e.g. adenylate kinase, serpins ) in order to understand how the constraints of folding and func#on mold the design of mul#-\u00addomain proteins. In addi#on, my group inves#gates several folding related phenomena such as folding coopera#vity, domain swapping, etc. We develop and adopt new computa#onal methods to understand protein structure and folding, as required.

Phosphoinosi#de signals provide molecular control for key sub-\u00adcellular processes such as membrane remodelling , cytoskeletal func#on, transcrip#on and transla#on. Through these processes, this signalling pathway orchestrates basic cellular behaviours such as cell division, shape changes, polarized movement and cell death. The overall goal of our work is to understand how the architecture this signalling cascade is designed to deliver op#mal physiological outputs. We use the fruit fly Drosophila as our model system; the goal is to discover key principles of signal transduc#on that are likely to be conserved during evolu#on but experimentally more func#ons. In order to #ghtly regulate PI(4,5)P2 levels, it is essen#al for cells to closely monitor PI(4,5)P2 levels at the plasma membrane and to closely match the rate of PI(4,5)P2 resynthesis with its consump#on by signalling reac#ons. We are studying the mechanisms by which PI(4,5)P2 levels are regulated in the context of Drosophila phototransduc#on. A second area of research is the analysis of cellular growth during larval development. We have recently iden#ed a novel phosphoinosi#de kinase that appears essen#al for larval growth and works thorough the evolu#onarily conserved growth regulator TOR. Several exci#ng projects are available in both the above areas. They involve a mixture of Drosophila molecular gene#cs, lipid biochemistry, cell biology and live imaging both in cells and in the intact organism.

Garcia-\u00adMurillas I, et.al (2006) Iazaro encodes a Acid RecogniKon and Metabolism The blueprint of life for each organism is resident in its genome. Nucleic acid metabolizing enzymes ensure proper informa#on transfer from the genome for synthesis of appropriate eector molecules. Members of this broad group of enzymes are also instrumental in the replica#on and maintenance of the genome. Perturba#on in the func#on of these enzymes due to muta#ons or inhibitors has an adverse eect on the survival of the organism. In my laboratory we study four processes involving the ac#on of nucleic acid metabolizing enzymes on the genome. These processes are (a) DNA Mismatch repair (b) Translesion D N A s y n t h e s i s ( c ) A d a p # v e mutagenesis and (d) Replica#on of the Japanese Encephali#s Virus genome. X-\u00adray crystallography methods, biophysical techniques and func#onal assays, we aim to provide structural insight into the mechanism of ac#on of enzymes/enzyme complexes involved in each of these processes. Generally, for all cellular processes to func#on op#mally, the integrity of the genome has to be maintained. However, the crea#on and reten#on of error in DNA allows for the evolu#on of the genome in order to relieve selec#on pressure imposed by an adverse environment. These two conflic#ng requirements have led to the presence of molecules and molecular mechanisms that either prevent (e.g. DNA mismatch repair) or facilitate (e.g. error-\u00adprone DNA Polymerases) the appearance of muta#ons. My laboratory aims to unearth the structural mechanisms employed by these molecular determinants of genomic integrity and plas#city to achieve func#on and modulate the rate of evolu#on.

Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr. physical basis of insect flight The spectacular evolu#onary success of insects owes much to the evolu#on of flight. Insect flight is characterized by speed, control and manoeuvrability. Their wings flap at very rapid rates (typically on the order of 10-\u00ad100 Hz) and hence their sensory system must acquire and process informa#on at similar rates. How do the nervous systems of insects tackle the extraordinary challenges of acquiring, integra#ng and processing mul#modal sensory informa#on and genera#ng of rapid behavioural responses to ensure stable flight? Our laboratory combines inputs from diverse disciplines such as physics, biomechanics, neurobiology and behaviour to address this ques#on. Broadly speaking, our approach involves the iden#ca#on and measurement of interes#ng flight behaviours (Diptera, the dissec#on of their physical and sensorimotor machinery to understand the mechanisms underlying these behaviours. On the physical front, we combine aerodynamic studies on flapping wings with high-\u00adspeed videographic measurements of wing mo#on to understand how flapping wings generate and modulate aerodynamic flight forces to determine their aerial trajectories. On the neurobiological front, we are inves#ga#ng the combined role of vision and mechanosensa#on in flight control in insects, including the neural pathways that integrate and process these mul#-\u00adsensory inputs. More recently, we have also begun specic inves#ga#ons on insect flight in their natural context. These include specic projects on insect-\u00adplant interac#ons, as well as inves#ga#ons of longer-\u00ad scale flight phenomena such as long distance migra#on and dispersal. Together, these studies are aimed to provide a broader level picture of insect flight from neurons and physiology to ecology. In addi#on to the above, we are also beginning new projects to study the physics and biology of termite mound architecture in the coming years.

Sane Community and Ecosystems Ecology My research interests span two broad areas of ecology: plant-\u00adherbivore-\u00adsoil interac#ons and biodiversity-\u00adecosystem func#on rela#onships. Current research in the lab is grouped around three themes that examine How interac#ons and feedbacks between climate, biogeochemistry, res and herbivory influence the structure, composi#on and stability of ecosystems and the cycling and sequestra#on of nutrients. The role of species diversity in regula#ng ecosystem func#on and provisioning of ecosystem services to humans. How projected changes in climate such as increasing variability of rainfall, increased frequency of droughts, increasing aridity in the tropics, nitrogen and phosphorus deposi#on and rising CO2 will impact ecosystem func#on, stability and services. Our work addresses the above ques#ons across the gamut of natural ecosystem types of the Indian sub-\u00adcon#nent, with the goal of bringing a comprehensive understanding of biome-\u00adscale vegeta#on and nutrient dynamics in the sub-\u00adcon#nent.

Surprisingly liLle is known about this key phase of the evolu#on of life: eukaryotes began to diverge from bacteria during the global oxygena#on event 2.5 billion years ago, but all living eukaryotes share a more recent common ancestor da#ng from about 1.5 billion years ago. Data from modern eukaryo#c genomes might allow us to reconstruct the intervening billion-\u00adyear period during which quintessen#al eukaryo#c features emerged: machinery, and vesicle trac. In par#cular, we are pursuing two complementary research direc#ons. Forward in #me: we analyze poten#al origin scenarios using biophysical and evolu#onary simula#ons, to uncover general principles about the evolu#on of compartmentalized cells. Backward in #me: we study the evolu#on of the molecular machinery underlying compartmentaliza#on using sequence data and phylogene#c techniques; we especially concentrate on molecules that underwent eukaryote-\u00ad specic gene family expansions, including Rabs, coat proteins, and SNAREs. The popula#on-\u00ad gene#c mechanisms that generated the earliest compartmentalized cells con#nue to drive the diversica#on of eukaryotes. Our evolu#onary perspec#ve might therefore shed light both on ancient events as well as on modern lineage-\u00adspecic and #ssue-\u00adspecic elabora#ons of trac systems.

Focusing on mammals and birds, we use eld-\u00adcollected samples, assemble molecular gene#c data and analyze these data with phylogene#c, phylogeographic and popula#on gene#c inferences.

Uma Ramakrishnan ComputaKonal approaches to protein science Just as few alphabets give rise to large number of words, nature uses 20 amino acids to produce large number of proteins in the living cell. The type and order in which amino acids are arranged in a protein completely dictate the structure and func#on of a protein. Huge amounts of amino acid sequence data are generated from whole-\u00ad genome sequencing projects. We employ computer algorithms which try to match new protein sequences to mathema#cal proles or Hidden Markov Models of previously characterized protein families, see for example (1). Structure implies func#on, but proteins could undergo structural changes that are relevant to func#on. We employ molecular dynamics simula#ons to reveal structural changes of proteins, for example (2). Proteins are seldom isolated in a biological cell.

Emo#onally signicant experiences tend to be well remembered, and the amygdala has a pivotal role in this process. But the rapid and ecient encoding of emo#onal memories can become maladap#ve \u2014 severe stress o[en turns them into a source of chronic anxiety. What are the cellular mechanisms underlying these powerful emo#onal symptoms? To answer this ques#on, we have been using a range of behavioral, morphometric, in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological tools to iden#fy correlates of stress-\u00adinduced modula#on amygdala structure and func#on \u2014 from cellular and synap#c mechanisms to their behavioural c o n s e q u e n c e s i n rodents. Our ndings point to unique features of stress-\u00adinduced plas#city in the amygdala, which are in striking contrast to those seen in the hippocampus and cortex, and could have long-\u00adterm consequences for pathological fear and anxiety exhibited in people with aec#ve disorders. In addi#on to behavioral experience, the genes we inherit can also cause cogni#ve and emo#onal dysfunc#on. Strikingly, individuals aicted with certain types of au#sm spectrum disorder o[en exhibit impaired cogni#ve func#on alongside high anxiety and mood lability.

Current research in the laboratory focuses mainly [but not exclusively], on understanding interac#ons between cell death and survival cues in the control of T-\u00adcell number in the mammalian immune system. Although nomadic and distributed in dierent #ssues, T-\u00adcell numbers show minimal changes during life-\u00adspan and are conserved across individuals, indica#ve of cell-\u00adautonomous programs of death and survival. Like many other cell types, T-\u00adcells depend on extrinsic cues from growth factors to regulate nutrient uptake for their metabolic needs. However, the integra#on of signals received from cytokine receptors at the cell membrane with processes occurring within cells and necessary for survival remain to be understood. In an eort to understand these we study cellular responses ini#ated in response to nutrient depriva#on as well as mechanisms that prevail in cells that survive this stress. We have shown that spa#al regula#on of molecular intermediates and resultant crosstalk with other pathways has signicant bearing on signaling outputs regula#ng cell survival. In this context, Notch signaling and the consequences to nutrient sensing and calcium homeostasis is an emerging area of interest in my laboratory.

Neuroscience is being transformed by techniques that make all this real. We use these methods to understand how the brain computes, and specically, to ask how we learn. First, we use 2-\u00adphoton microscopy to monitor cellular ac#vity in the brain of mice as they learn to associate a sound or other sensory s#mulus with a reward or a subsequent pu or air. This lets us get a picture of how the ac#vity and connec#ons change in real #me, as the animal learns. Second we use electrical and op#cal s#mulus methods to turn brain cells on and o under computer control. This lets us build up connec#on diagrams (although s#ll very incomplete) of circuits that compute the meaning of sensory informa#on. It also lets us probe in detail how these connec#ons change during learning. Third we model these computa#ons and learning events. Because the brain computes both with chemical and electrical signals, we build models that represent all these processes: protein synthesis, molecular signaling, electrical ac#vity, and the growth of new connec#ons between cells. We #e these models closely to our own experiments, and work done by collaborators and labs around the world. Together, these models and experiments build towards a deeper understanding of brain computa#on in percep#on, learning, and disease.

This will help in understanding how a eukaryo#c cell constructs signaling complexes (local composi#on) and engages in membrane trac, in par#cular during endocytosis. To study phenomena at the cellular scale, we u#lize principles from the physical sciences to frame ques#ons about movement of molecules and organelles inside cells.

Sudhir Krishna The roles of serotonin in neural and non-\u00adneural systems The major interests of my laboratory are the cellular mechanisms ac#vated by serotonin, a molecule widely recognized as an important neurotransmiLer. Interes#ngly, most of the serotonin is present outside the nervous system and seems to be involved in normal physiology in a variety of ways including early development in mammals. Most of the interac#ons of serotonin take place through its receptors expressed on the cell surface. Among the many receptors that it interacts with, two of these i.e. the 5-\u00adHT1A and 5-\u00adHT2A receptors have also been strongly implicated in psychiatric condi#ons. Therefore, serotonin plays an important role in communica#on in the nervous system and also governs development and physiology. Our studies have primarily focused on the regula#on of 5-\u00adHT2A receptors in neuronal and non-\u00adneuronal cells and also on its role in early developmental processes. The 5-\u00adHT2A receptor is also an important target of many clinically prescribed an#psycho#cs. Using modied 5-\u00adHT2A receptors which can be visually localized within cells and '5-\u00adHT2A knockout' mice, we have made signicant observa#ons regarding the behavior of the receptor in the presence of serotonin and an#psycho#cs. Recent results using pre-\u00adimplanta#on mouse embryos and mammalian embryonic stem cells have determined that serotonin localizes to the mitochondria and aects mitochondrial poten#al. This has important implica#ons for development and cell survival. These studies are being extended to human induced pluripotent stem cells and could help us determine the role of these receptors and their endogenous and exogenous ligands Selected Publica#ons: (2008). in pre-\u00adimplanta#on mouse embryos is 0 9 ) .

We are specically interested in the second messenger Inositol 1,4,5-\u00adtrisphosphate (InsP3) and its receptor - the InsP3 receptor. This protein exists on the membranes of intracellular calcium stores and performs the dual func#on of a receptor for InsP3 and a channel for calcium release. We address InsP3 receptor func#on in the model organism Drosophila using gene#c, molecular, cellular, electrophysiological and behavioral methods. Our recent work has demonstrated that reducing InsP3R func#on in Drosophila neurons aects feeding and growth in larvae and mul#ple aspects of flight circuit development and func#on in pupae and adults. These studies have shown that restoring InsP3R func#on in neurons which either synthesize monoamines (like dopamine) or insulin-\u00adlike pep#des (ILPs) rescues InsP3R mutant defects. A gene#c RNAi screen in the lab has helped iden#fy a set of surface receptors that ini#ate IP3 signaling in flight circuit neurons (Agrawal, T et al., in prep). More recently, projects to understand how InsP3R mutants respond to changes in regula#on of intracellular store Ca2+ and to stress condi#ons have been ini#ated. Work from my group has demonstrated for the rst #me in a physiological context the requirement for store-\u00adoperated calcium entry downstream of InsP3 signaling in neurons. Results from these studies suggest that gene#c and pharmacological methods could be used for controlling intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis as a possible therapeu#c strategy in certain neurodegenera#ve and metabolic diseases. Drosophila model and human studies in the context of such diseases are in progress.

Intracellular signaling in neurons: unraveling specicity, compensatory mechanisms and Transport Biological membranes are oil-\u00adlike, and charged solutes can only cross these barriers with the help of transport proteins. My laboratory studies several such proteins, ranging from the voltage-\u00adgated K+ channel in neurons to transporters that play a r\u00f4le in the survival of plants in salty soils. Our aim is to understand how these proteins do their jobs and to see how their ac#vity contributes to the overall physiology of the cell or organism. Electrical signaling in the nervous system requires rapid movement of ions across the nerve cell membrane. We have studied how the proteins that mediate this ionic movement func#on using a combina#on of molecular modeling, mutagenesis and electrophysiology. Plants use a variety of strategies to survive in salty soil. Barriers in the root which prevent external fluid from directly entering the xylem contribute to the ability of the plants to regulate what gets sent up to the shoot. Our data indicates that barriers are beLer developed and func#onal in salt-\u00adtolerant varie#es of rice than in sensi#ve varie#es and we are inves#ga#ng the mechanisms underlying their deposi#on. At the cellular level, we have found that the plasma membranes of cells from tolerant varie#es are much less permeable to Na+ than those from sensi#ve varie#es.

J Exp Botany 63, 3289-3296 How do proteins fold, unfold and misfold? The polypep#de chain of a protein must coil, turn, bend, loop and twist itself in a very precise manner while folding into the unique structure that enables the protein to func#on in the cell. The protein folding problem is to understand how structure develops as a protein folds. How proteins fold has been a long-\u00adstanding, unsolved puzzle in biology, whose solu#on has obvious biotechnological as well as medical implica#ons. In par#cular, the improper folding of some proteins, and their consequent aggrega#on into amyloid brils, are characteris#c features of several neuro-\u00addegenera#ve diseases as well as of the prion diseases. An understanding of the mechanism of protein folding will also lead to a beLer understanding of the other facet of the protein folding problem, which is how to predict the func#onal structure of a protein from the amino-\u00adacid sequence that species it. My laboratory uses several small proteins, including barstar, monellin , the SH3 domain of the PI3-\u00adkinase, -\u00adsynuclein , tau, and the mouse prion protein as archetypical model proteins for studying how proteins fold, unfold as well as aggregate. We also study how correct folding is assisted by the chaperone GroEL . We use the tools of protein engineering and physical biochemistry. These include diverse op#cal spectroscopic methods such as #me-\u00adresolved fluorescence methods, as well as nuclear magne#c resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry methods. Our kine#c measurements span the #me domain of 100 microseconds to 10 hours. Highlights of our recent work on protein folding and unfolding include (1) the demonstra#on that a dry molten globule forms ini#ally during unfolding; (2) the demonstra#on that the kinase SH3 domain folds and unfolds via mul#ple intermediates; and (3) the demonstra#on of switching between mul#ple folding pathways during the folding of monellin . Highlights of our recent work on protein misfolding and aggrega#on include (1) the demonstra#on that amyloid protobrils may have dierent morphologies when formed on dierent pathways, and that a single muta#on in the protein sequence or a change in aggrega#on condi#ons can lead to switching between alterna#ve available pathways; (2) the demonstra#on that tau can u#lize a secondary pathway for amyloid bril forma#on; and (3) the iden#ca#on of the direct oligomeric precursor of worm-\u00adlike amyloid brils formed by the protein.

Jayant Udgaonkar Developmental neurobiology of olfacKon and movement Our work is aimed at understanding how circuits are put together during development to generate the animal's behaviour. We study the development and morphogenesis of individual neural and neuromuscular circuit components. We integrate these studies with those that examine how neurons connect to form circuits in the brain and also connect with muscles. This gives us a picture of how the 'plumbing' is developmentally put together. We next examine when and how func#onal proper#es of these circuits are put in place. The segmental organiza#on of the brain in the fly is remarkably similar to that of vertebrates and points to a common-\u00ad, rather than an independent-\u00ad origin during evolu#on. This, and the conserved nature of many molecular and cellular aspects, holds out the promise of a general relevance to the understanding of how func#onal neural circuits underlying behavior are assembled during development.

K VijayRaghavan A major interest in my lab is isola#on and characteriza#on of pep#des of therapeu#c value from marine cone snails, frog skin secre#ons and wasp venoms. Mass spectrometry-\u00adbased de novo sequencing of venom components combined with deep sequencing RNA from the venom glands and valida#on by chemical synthesis is our main thrust. We are developing several assays mainly u#lizing the power of Drosophila gene#cs, Oocyte expression of specic channel proteins and cell biology to establish protocols for ac#vity dependent purica#on of pep#des that could be drug leads. These studies are done in collabora#on mainly with Prof. Balaram at IISc. I also Drosophila Drosophila, like the Brahmin, is born twice, rst from the egg as a maggot, then from the pupa as an imago. In both of its incarna#ons the fly's olfactory behavior undergoes profound changes with age and experience. An important problem is to dis#nguish between innate and acquired behavior. This is a dicult and, in several respects, an unseLled issue. Understanding adap#ve behavior and establishing its neural correlates is the focus of our group's interest. As a part of this eort we are studying learning and memory in larva and imago. Some years ago we began to inves#gate imaginal condi#oning, a process by which, in the rst few days a[er eclosion, the fly learns to dis#nguish between aLractants and repellents. It develops aLrac#on towards chemicals to which it is exposed and an increased aversion to odors it has not experienced (these reports, 1999). Bilal Rashid, Farzana Anjum and Jawaid Ahsan have described mutants, which aect imaginal c o n d i # o n i n g . Tuhin Chakraborty and Sunil Prabhakar have found that imaginal condi#oning is correlated with an increased peripheral sensory response (EAG). Abu Baker and Gayatri Ranganathan have analyzed shock avoidance learning in the larva to separate various components of olfactory memory.

NCBS is pleased to announce PhD and IntPhD opportuni#es in the physical and mathema#cal study of biological systems. Biology, all the way from molecules, through cells, #ssues, networks in the brain, to ecosystems holds great promise today for bright young theorists. Exci#ng problems abound, a vibrant and connected global community of theorists is growing and the thrill of conceptual discoveries await the prepared and well-\u00adtrained student. The theory program is open to students with a physics/ maths/chemistry/engineering background and a strong curiosity in biology, as well as students with a biology background having a strong interest in the mathema#cal and computa#onal study of living systems. What is unusual about this program? Crea#ng and nding new problems is an essen#al part of all scien#c research. We put developing this skill at the heart of our program design. Students will learn to create, select and solve research problems at the interface of biology and other sciences. They are encouraged to chart their own research path in conjunc#on with faculty of the theory group. Educa#on extends beyond the classroom and good theory and prac#ce are intertwined. We encourage students to try their hand at designing small experiments -\u00ad-\u00ad biological, electromechanical and computa#onal -\u00ad-\u00ad in laboratories maintained by faculty associated with the theory group. We have a strong visitor program with researchers from all over the world regularly spending a few days to a few months at the group. What is the curriculum? We provide core courses to establish a rigorous founda#on in mathema#cal and numerical analysis, and cover topics including sta#s#cal mechanics and so[ maLer physics, molecular dynamics, stochas#c processes, nonlinear dynamics, control and op#miza#on, informa#on theory, and so on. Bridging courses in both basic biology and basic mathema#cs will ensure that the core courses are accessible to all. Based on students' needs we also oer advanced courses on mul#disciplinary topics like non-\u00adequilibrium sta#s#cal mechanics, complex networks, evolu#onary dynamics, biorobo#cs and func#onal genomics. Bangalore has an excellent diverse environment for theory: Students can complement NCBS courses with those from surrounding ins#tutes such as the Indian Ins#tute of Science, Raman Research Ins#tute and the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scien#c Research, all of with whom we have ac#ve interac#ons. The Theory Program The InsKtute of Stem Cell Biology & RegeneraKve Medicine The Ins#tute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenera#ve Medicine (inStem) is a new ini#a#ve growing in an expanded campus with NCBS. In the previous pages you have seen a diversity of research programs across the scale of the Life Sciences in the laboratories of principal inves#gators. InStem aims to complement this approach by developing teams of researchers to address important ques#ons in biomedical sciences and human biology. InStem's research is structured into teams. inStem teams are composed of senior, intermediate and early career scien#sts and the scien#sts themselves are a mix of researchers, technology developers and clinicians. Team members are drawn from inStem, NCBS and elsewhere. Students wishing to rotate in these teams will be associated with an appropriate inves#gator in a team at inStem. The possibility of joining one of the themes at inStem for a PhD, will require a mentor at NCBS and will be decided in consulta#on with the Theme Coordinator and Head Academics, NCBS.
