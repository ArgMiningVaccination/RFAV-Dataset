This is excellent for young children. Cough with Congestion: Ma Huang, Thyme, and Licorice root. This combination includes a broncho-dilating herb (Maa Huang), an antispasmodic and expectorant herb (thyme), and a soothing and expectorant herb (licorice root). It also tasted bad, so mix in some honey or glycerin to sweeten it. Remember that Ma Huang should be administered only to older children and is intended for short-term use. Dry, Spasmodic Cough: Drosera (sundew) and Thyme - equal parts of both herbs either as liquid extracts or as the dried herbs prepared in a tea. One tablespoon of the liquid extract preparation every 3 to 4 hours. For the tea, brew 1 to 2 grams of each herb and then strain. Drink 8 to 10 ounces, 3 to 4 times daily. I'll usually recommend steam with either tea tree oil or eucalyptus oil as another means to loosen mucus and help clear the airways. Place \u00bc teaspoon of either oil in a pot of boiling water and steam for 10 to 15 minutes.
