At week 16, 79 percent of patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (CD) achieved clinical response1 and 67 percent were in clinical remission2 after receiving one ~6 mg/kg intravenous (IV) dose followed by one 90 mg subcutaneous (SC) dose of STELARA\u00ae (ustekinumab), open label.3 Intestinal ultrasound (IUS) responses were assessed and were detected as early as week 4.4 Week 16 data (digital oral presentation, or DOP 13) and IUS response data (DOP 10) from STARDUST are being presented as digital oral presentations at the 15th Congress of the European Crohn's & Colitis Organization (ECCO).3,4 The primary endpoint of the 48-week STARDUST study is comparative endoscopic response5 among adult patients with CD receiving STELARA maintenance therapy. At week 16, patients who achieved a 70 point decrease in Crohn's Disease Activity Index score6 (CDAI70 responders) were randomized into treat-to-target or routine standard of care treatment groups at a 1:1 ratio.7 Of the 220 CDAI70 responders randomized to the treat-to-target arm, 37 percent achieved endoscopic response at week 16.3 Endoscopy at week 16 was measured only in the treat-to-target group.7 Treat-to-target is a proactive treatment strategy where frequently monitored outcomes, like endoscopic response, biomarkers and clinical symptoms, guide use of the medication.8 STARDUST is the first study of a treat-to-target strategy in CD using endoscopic response to guide treatment. \"Crohn's disease patients may respond to treatment while continuing to experience internal inflammation that can cause irreversible damage. These patients may benefit from a more proactive, robust treatment approach and less invasive monitoring methods,\" said Professor Silvio Danesei, Head of the Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Centre at Humanitas Research Hospital, Milan, Italy and principal investigator. \"I am encouraged by these data, that demonstrate the potential clinical utility of the noninvasive IUS method in helping guide treatment of CD and look forward to forthcoming data that may help us better understand the possible benefits of a treat-to-target strategy.\" IUS is a complementary method of assessing CD activity, based upon measuring transmural bowel features, like thickness of the bowel wall and presence of hypervascularization.9 STARDUST is the first study to use IUS for monitoring CD patients in an interventional setting. Future studies need to confirm whether early IUS response at week 4 is predictive of longer-term (i.e., week 16 and up to week 48) clinical and endoscopic outcomes for CD patients. The STARDUST week 16 interim analysis includes 500 participants with moderately to severely active CD receiving an IV induction dose of STELARA ~6 mg/kg, followed by a STELARA 90 mg SC injection at week 8.3 In the interim analysis, patient response was assessed up to week 16. Participants were either na\u00efve to prior biologics or had previously been exposed to no more than one biologic medicine. At week 16, the safety profile for STELARA in STARDUST was consistent with the established safety profile observed in Phase 3 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) clinical trials, as well as that seen in other indications.10,11 \"STARDUST represents a significant milestone in our commitment to helping Crohn's disease patients and the physicians who treat them,\" said Jan Wehkamp, M.D., Vice President, Gastroenterology Disease Area Leader, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. \"The data from this study may provide us with key clinical insights which may inform future treatment strategies.\" Janssen is presenting a total of 23 abstracts at this year's ECCO congress. STELARA is currently approved for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in the U.S., Canada, the European Union (EU) and Japan. About the STARDUST Trial STARDUST is a randomized, international, multi-center, interventional Phase 3b study evaluating the proportion of patients with endoscopic response, defined as a 50% reduction from baseline in simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD) at week 48. STARDUST is evaluating 500 participants receiving an IV induction dose of STELARA 6 mg/kg, followed by a STELARA 90 mg SC injection at week 8. At week 16, patients with a CDAI reduction of 70 points (CDAI70) were randomized to treat-to-target or standard of care treatment arms (1:1 ratio) and will be followed through the end of the study (48 weeks). Primary endpoint data are anticipated for presentation later this year. About Crohn's Disease (CD) CD is one of the two main forms of IBD, which affect an estimated 3 million Americans.12 CD is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract with no known cause, but the disease is associated with abnormalities of the immune system that could be triggered by a genetic predisposition, diet or other environmental factors. Symptoms of CD can vary but often include abdominal pain and tenderness, frequent diarrhea, rectal bleeding, weight loss and fever. There is currently no cure for CD.13 About STELARA\u00ae (ustekinumab) STELARA\u00ae (ustekinumab), a human IL-12 and IL-23 antagonist, is approved in the United States for the treatment of: 1) adults and children 12 years and older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy; 2) adult patients (18 years or older) with active psoriatic arthritis, used alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX); 3) adult patients (18 years and older) with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease; 4) adult patients (18 years and older) with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. STELARA Dosing for Crohn's Disease Adults with Crohn's disease will receive the first dose of STELARA through a vein in the arm (intravenous infusion) in a healthcare facility by a healthcare provider. It takes at least 1 hour to receive the full dose of medicine. STELARA will then be given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) 8 weeks after the first dose of STELARA, then every 8 weeks thereafter. See full Prescribing Information for Dosing Information for other indications.

You should not start taking STELARA\u00ae if you have any kind of infection unless your doctor says it is okay. Before starting STELARA\u00ae, tell your doctor if you: - think you have an infection or have symptoms of an infection such as: - fever, sweats, or chills - muscle aches - cough - shortness of breath - blood in phlegm - weight loss - warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body - diarrhea or stomach pain - burning when you urinate or urinate more often than normal - feel very tired - are being treated for an infection. - get a lot of infections or have infections that keep coming back. - have TB, or have been in close contact with someone with TB. After starting STELARA\u00ae, call your doctor right away if you have any symptoms of an infection (see above). STELARA\u00ae can make you more likely to get infections or make an infection that you have worse. People who have a genetic problem where the body does not make any of the proteins interleukin 12 (IL12) and interleukin 23 (IL23) are at a higher risk for certain serious infections that can spread throughout the body and cause death. People who take STELARA\u00ae may also be more likely to get these infections. Cancers STELARA\u00ae may decrease the activity of your immune system and increase your risk for certain types of cancer. Tell your doctor if you have ever had any type of cancer. Some people who had risk factors for skin cancer developed certain types of skin cancers while receiving STELARA\u00ae. Tell your doctor if you have any new skin growths. Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS) RPLS is a rare condition that affects the brain and can cause death. The cause of RPLS is not known. If RPLS is found early and treated, most people recover. Tell your doctor right away if you have any new or worsening medical problems including: headache, seizures, confusion, and vision problems. Serious Allergic Reactions Serious allergic reactions can occur. Stop using STELARA\u00ae and get medical help right away if you have any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction such as: feeling faint, swelling of your face, eyelids, tongue, or throat, chest tightness, or skin rash. Lung Inflammation Cases of lung inflammation have happened in some people who receive STELARA\u00ae and may be serious. These lung problems may need to be treated in a hospital. Tell your doctor right away if you develop shortness of breath or a cough that doesn't go away during treatment with STELARA\u00ae. Before receiving STELARA\u00ae, tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you: - have any of the conditions or symptoms listed above for serious infections, cancers, or RPLS. - ever had an allergic reaction to STELARA\u00ae or any of its ingredients.
