With over 4,000 births each year, Fairview Hospital is expected to boost the number of cord blood stem cell units that will ultimately be distributed to help treat leukemia and other blood-borne diseases, as well as support research efforts. By donating your child's cord blood you are providing the lifesaving opportunity for someone else. The process of cord blood donation for expectant parents is safe for both mother and child. At the hospital, you will be asked to complete appropriate paperwork to indicate your consent. After your baby is born, the cord blood will be collected by your doctor, along with the delivery of the afterbirth. If you do not choose to donate your newborn's umbilical cord blood, it will be discarded. For further information, please visit [CCBC's website](http://www.clevelandcordblood.org/) or call 216.896.0360. Birth Certificate Upon admission to your room you will receive a welcome folder with an information packet regarding the birth certificate process.

A Birth Certificate Assistant is available to assist with any questions regarding the birth certificate process and their contact number is included in the packet. Also included in the packet are instructions for ordering your baby's birth certificate, and again, the Birth Certificate Assistant will be able to answer your questions or help explain the process to follow, like whether it'll be a paper or electronic process.
