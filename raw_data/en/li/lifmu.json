Dr. Zachary and Dr. Ashley, let's start with your story. We'd love to hear how you got started and how the journey has been so far. We met in Chiropractic school with different educational backgrounds and a different vision of our dream practice. After each of us spent time at a few different clinics our visions started to align with the other persons and that's when we decided that we should have a practice together. We opened our first clinic 4 years ago and took over another one shortly after that. Together we built up a great practice in Winnetka that we just sold and are now solely focused on our full-time practice in Crystal Lake. Our vision for our dream practice has been to have a thriving practice, where everyone feels comfortable and welcomed the second they walk in the door and that we have as much fun as we can while helping everyone achieve their goals for a healthier lifestyle. Has it been a smooth road? Our biggest challenge was starting a practice from scratch, in a new place where we knew no one, in an industry that is based off of referrals. It is not something I would recommend to most doctors coming out of school, but at the same time we learned a lot that has helped us grow the practice. We were forced to get out and meet people and get involved with the community from day 1 and that was probably the most important and beneficial thing that came out of it. The second biggest challenge was trying to maintain two practices while still trying to grow our family, and that was the deciding factor for selling one of the practices last spring. So let's switch gears a bit and go into the A To Z Chiropractic story. Tell us more about the business. Our practice is solely focused on making our patients feel comfortable with the treatments they are receiving and to make sure they are getting the right treatment for them to get them where they want to be. We don't do long term care plans at our practice, because we want our patients to trust us and to know that we are here for them when they need us, we don't want anyone to feel like they are forced to come for care. We pride ourselves on having a broad knowledge base in several areas of alternative medicine and chiropractic treatments. If one treatment isn't working for a patient we have several other therapies that we can use to treat their problems. Dr. Zach does more of the Chiropractic adjustments, soft tissue work, ART (Active Release Technique), pain relief, posture correction, and he also performs DOT physicals for drivers that need their medical card. Dr. Ashley focuses more on the nutrition, supplementation, and food testing. She is currently in school for Functional Medicine, and we will be adding that onto our practice in 2018. How do you think the industry will change over the next decade? I think Chiropractic will continue to thrive in the coming years, mostly because people are tired of just taking different medications everyday to treat their symptoms instead of actually figuring out the root cause. More people are turning to organic foods and are more aware of carcinogenic products and I believe that population will continue to grow. Functional medicine, in my opinion, will be the future of healthcare. It's using food, supplements and a healthier lifestyle to treat patients in a new and more natural way.
