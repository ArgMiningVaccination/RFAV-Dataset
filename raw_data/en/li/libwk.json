Lyme disease is a bacterial infection of Borrelia burgdorferi and other species, a bacteria transmitted through the bite of a tick ( Ixodes species ). However, new evidence suggests other biting insects may transmit LD as well. In the early 1970's, mysterious cases of rheumatoid arthritis developed in several children in Lyme, CT. Many of the children recalled having a rash and/or being bit by a tick. In 1981, Dr. Willy Burgdorfer who had been studying Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever discovered the spirochete that caused the illness in these children. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDLyme Disease: What Is It? There at at least 5 subspecies of Borrelia burgdorferi and at least 100 other strains of Borrelia in the United States. There are more than 300 strains worldwide. More than 95% of reported cases in the United States come from Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Wisconsin. There are at least 300,000 new cases of Lyme disease reported each year in the United States with now millions of people living with Lyme disease annually. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDLyme Disease: Canadian Stats In Canada, there have been less than 1000 cases of Lyme disease reported in 2016 (987). However, there has been more than 6 -fold increase in Lyme cases since 2009. In 2015, 91% of all cases were reported from Ontario, Nova Scotia and Quebec, with Nova Scotia having the most cases (26 per 100,000). As in the US, the incidence of Lyme is growing rapidly and likely grossly underreported. In Ontario, Public Health officials state Lyme is only caused by Borrelia burgdorferi , but research has proven this to be untrue. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, What Is It? Lyme disease is the #1 spreading vector -borne epidemic worldwide. Borrelia species can infect any tissue or organ system. Therefore, multiple symptoms are observed with patients with LD. Borrelia species may also change forms and have a relatively slow replication cycle. Most bacteria replicate every 20 minutes to 8 hours. Borrelia replicate every 1 to 16 days. Borrelia species are the ultimate shape -shifters. They can exist as a spirochete (corkscrew form), cyst form, cell -wall deficient form filamentous form. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDWhat Are The Symptoms Of Acute Lyme Disease? Headaches and neck stiffness Fever Arthritis with swollen joints and/or spine pain Muscle pain Erythema migrans (\"bullseye\" rash) Fatigue Chills Swollen lymph nodes Heart palpitation Shortness of breath Memory loss Facial palsy (Bell's palsy) Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDWhat Are The Symptoms Of Acute Lyme Erythema migrans rash Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND What Are The Symptoms Of Acute Lyme Disease? Acute symptoms can occur anywhere from 3 -30 days following a tick bite. CDC states up to 70% of people infected with Lyme disease get the erythema migrans (EM) rash, but others suggest less than 40% of infected people get the stereotypical EM rash. The EM rash is pathognomonic for LD, which means there is no other organism that causes this type of rash. Most people with LD have no recollection of ever being bitten by a tick! Lyme disease symptoms are often vague and resemble numerous other infectious disease and autoimmune conditions. Misdiagnosis is common. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDWhat Are The Symptoms Of Chronic Lyme Disease? Fatigue Abdominal pain and bowel changes Memory loss or cognitive impairment Numbness or tingling of extremities Sensory distortion of skin (burning sensations), especially in hands or feet \"wandering\" symptoms Light or sound sensitivity Dizziness or vertigo Sleep disturbances Rheumatism Cardiac problems: MVP, heart block, heart palpitations, chest pain Balance or coordination problems.

Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDCoinfections with Lyme Disease Ticks and can spread numerous other infections, which cause similar symptoms of LD. Lyme others...Why The Rise in Lyme Disease? Worldwide, we are seeing an increase the in the number of cases of LD as well as other vector -borne illnesses. We have already seen epidemics of Dengue virus in South America, Ebola virus in Western Africa and Chikungunya virus in Central and South America (now spreading to North America). Ticks, fleas, mosquitos, flies and even snails can transmit these illnesses. The World Health Organization (WHO) anticipates that climate change will result in an increased incidence of vector -borne diseases. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDWhy The Rise in Lyme Disease? According to the WHO... Climate change and vectorborne diseases Many vulnerability assessments anticipate climate change will result in increased incidence of communicable diseases including vectorborne diseases (VBDs). VBDs are transmitted by the bites of infected mosquitoes and other insects (vectors). Their incidence is particularly dependent on climatic factors because: Insects have no internal control over their physiological temperatures and the ambient temperature determines their reproduction rate, biting behavior and survival: their distribution may expand as the earth warms. Humidity and availability of water for breeding are also determinants of vectors' distribution, longevity and behavior. The incubation period of pathogens inside vectors is temperature -dependent (and tends to decrease at warmer temperatures). Human behavior is likely to be affected by climate change which will alter our interaction with vectors and the diseases they carry. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDhttp://www.wpro.who.int/mvp/climate_change/en/Why The Rise in Lyme Disease? Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Diagnosis of Lyme Disease The CDC criteria for LD was designed for surveillance purposes and do not necessarily reflect active infection with Borrelia species. The diagnosis of LD is a CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS ! There are over 100 strains of Borrelia in North America and more than 300 strains worldwide. Current testing only tests for Borrelia burgdorferi. We now know that half of West Coast cases of Lyme disease are caused by Borrelia miyomotoi. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDDiagnosis of Lyme Disease Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Diagnosis of Lyme Disease Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, ND Diagnosis of Lyme Disease CDC Criteria 1.Positive ELISA blood test. This is the screening test most doctors use through reference labs. 2.If the ELISA test is positive, they will then run a Lyme Western Blot, which is a more detailed antibody test looking at specific antibodies (called \"bands\") associated with the organism. They will look at IgG and IgM antibodies. 3.If 5 out of 10 IgG bands are positive or 2 out of 3 IgM bands are positive, the test is considered \"positive\". These criteria have not changed in more than 40 years of research on LD.

If you don't look, you won't find it. 4.It can take up to 6 weeks to produce antibodies once someone has been bitten by a tick, so no reliable testing for acute cases. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDDiagnosis of Lyme Disease The International Lyme and Associated Disease Society (ILADS) have established a different set of criteria for diagnosing LD and coinfections. ILADS doctors often diagnose patients based on their clinical symptoms in conjunction with lab tests that shows that someone has had exposure to a particular organism(s). Other inflammatory and autoimmune illnesses must be ruled out as well, since LD mimics many other conditions.

Patients who have suffered for many years with LD or have been disabled start to function again. Even if a patient had been exposed to a tick many years prior, often these treatment regimens help. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Antimicrobial Therapy: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly The Bad Many patients also experience die -off reactions called Herxheimer reactions (aka \"herxing\"). These are flu -like symptoms that occur as the organism is being killed and can last days to weeks in some individuals. Combinations of antimicrobials can have undesired side effects, including nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headaches. Long -term antimicrobial use can cause liver or other organ damage, so blood count, liver and kidney function need to be monitored closely. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Antimicrobial Therapy: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly The Ugly Combination antimicrobials can wipe out your normal bacterial flora in the gut, causing Clostridia difficile or yeast infections, which then need to be treated with other stronger antimicrobials or antifungals. Some antimicrobials suppress your own immune system, making it more difficult for you to fight your own infections. We don't fully understand the consequences of long -term antibiotic use in LD and how it disrupts the normal gut microbiome. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Diet for Lyme Disease There are many diets out there that promote various health benefits. I find most people with Lyme disease do well when they consume an alkaline diet. pH is tightly regulated by the body. Blood pH is between 7.2 -7.4. With exception to the stomach, bladder and vagina, most of our tissues are alkaline. Our cells and receptors function best at an alkaline pH. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDDiet for Lyme Disease Foods that be consumed often: Vegetables (eat all you want): Artichokes Asparagus Beets and beet greens Broccoli Cauliflower Celery Chard Green Seaweeds (Nori, Dulse, etc.) Scallions Spinach Sprouted grains Sprouts Tomatoes (raw only) Turnips Zucchini Vegetables (eat no more than 1 serving a day): Sweet potato Squash Yams Fruits: Avocado Grapefruit Lemon Lime Pomegranates Watermelon Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDFoods that can be consumed often: Vegetables (eat all you want): Artichokes Asparagus Beets and beet greens Broccoli (Nori, Dulse , etc.) Scallions Spinach Sprouted grains SproutsTomatoes (raw only) Turnips Zucchini Vegetables (eat no more than 1 serving a day): Sweet potato Squash Yams Fruits: Avocado Grapefruit Lemon -Lime Pomegranates WatermelonDiet for 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDGrains/Legumes: Amaranth Buckwheat Chia Kamut Lentils Lima beans Millet Mung beans Navy beans Pinto beans Red beans QuinoaSpelt White beans Nuts/Seeds: Almonds Brazil nuts Coconut Flax seeds Pumpkin seeds Sesame seeds Sunflower seedsOils: Avocado oil Coconut oil Flax oil Olive oil Safflower oil Beverages: Alkaline water Herbal teas Green drinks WaterDiet for Lyme Disease Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDFruits: Apricots Berries Papaya Pineapple PlumsNuts/Seeds: Pecans Hazel nuts Grains/Legumes: Brown rice White rice Oats Rye Hemp Soy (organic only) Oils: Sunflower oil Grapeseed oilMeat, Fish, Eggs: Beef Chicken Eggs -raised fish Pork Shellfish Turkey Fish (wild only): Mackerel Perch Pike Roughy Salmon Sardines Sole, TilapiaFoods that may be eaten in less than 20% of your weekly dietary intake: (neutral pH or slightly acid -forming)Diet for Lyme Disease Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDDairy Products: Cheese Ice cream Milk Sour cream Yogurt Fruits: Dried fruits Nuts/Seeds: Macadamia nuts Peanuts Pistachios Beverages: Alcohol Black tea Coffee Fruit juiceRefined, Processed and Simple carbohydrate Foods: All additives Artificial dyes, flavorings and sweeteners Candy, cookies, doughnuts, crackers Canned foods (they tend to contain lots of preservatives and chemicals) Chocolate/Cocoa Corn and all corn products (corn syrup, corn starch, etc.) Chips Margarine Preservatives ( Sulfites,Nitrites , etc.) Sugar YeastCondiments: Honey Jam Jelly Mustard Soy sauce Vinegar Oils: Corn oil Cottonseed oil Soybean oil Vegetable oil All hydrogenated oils and trans fatsFoods to avoid while on the program:Treatment of Lyme Disease Cowden Protocol : developed Rich in pentacyclic oxindole alkaloids (POA's), which help stimulate the immune system to fight infection Is a potent anti -inflammatory Useful for treating coinfections Little to no side effects Free of TOA's, which may inhibit action of POA's Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Modified Cowden Protocol Banderol Derived from Otaba tree in South America Broad spectrum activity against Lyme and coinfections Is a potent anti -inflammatory Works well in conjunction with Samento. Dr. Eva Sapi at University of New Haven showed that Samento and Banderol were able to eliminate all 3 forms of Borrelia . Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Modified Cowden Protocol Cumanda Derived from bark of Campsiandra angustifolia tree in South America. May be the most broad spectrum herb against Lyme and coinfections. Used locally to treat malaria. Is a potent anti -inflammatory. Used to treat arthritis and fever. Can produce significant Herxheimer reactions. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Modified Cowden Protocol Burbur Derived from leaves of Desmodium molliculum, an Amazonian plant. Used primarily for detoxification purposes, especially the liver, kidneys and lymphatics. Can protect against toxic effects of other medications. Beneficial to minimize or stop Herx reactions. Can use every 10 minutes if Herx reactions become intolerable for patients. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Modified Cowden Protocol Acute Lyme Disease: Start with Samento, Banderol and Cumanda Give 15 -30 drops 2 times per day in 1 oz water of each for 30 days. May add Burbur if Herxheimer reaction is strong. If patient starts Herx reaction, keep dose the same. Only increase dose if there is no improvement or reaction. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Modified Cowden Protocol Lyme Disease: Start with Samento, Banderol, Cumanda and Burbur Give 2 -4 drops 2 times per day in 1 oz water of each. Increase by 1 drop 2 times per day every 3 -4 days if there is no reaction or improvement up to 30 drops twice a day. If patient starts Herx reaction, keep dose the same. Give 10 drops of Burbur every 10 minutes for severe Herx reaction. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Cowden Protocol Combinations of these products are used to help kill the microbes, support detoxification and clear heavy metals. It is a 5 month protocol with the combination of herbs changing each month. Since these are liquid extracts and drop doses are administered, it is possible to use in children. Dose can be altered based on body weight. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Cowden Protocol Advantages: easy to administer (relatively), clinically beneficial, reasonably cost -effective. Disadvantages: Herx reactions common, long -term treatment, requires multiple bottles and dosing schedule (labor intensive). Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Let's take a break ...... . Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Zhang Protocol : developed by Dr. Qincao Zhang, LAc of Lyme Disease Zhang Protocol Dr. Zhang's protocol helps eradicate the infections, improve circulation, reduce inflammation and improve detoxification. It is one of the most comprehensive herbal protocols to address each aspect of LD. I use this protocol for 3 -6 months, depending on patient's response. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Zhang Protocol : Allicin Caps Allicin is one of the active ingredients in Allium sativum (garlic). Allicin Caps contain allitridi, which gets converted to allicin. Well-established anti -microbial, but also helps improve circulation and is mild anti -inflammatory. Time released caps, so allicin gets absorbed over a longer period of time. Patients will definitely excrete it through their skin, so may be socially problematic for some.

Other herbs that help support the immune system, have anti-microbial effects, anti -inflammatory and help improve circulation or reduce pain. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Managing Herxheimer Reactions AI#3: take 1 cap 3 -4 times per day before meals. Burbur: take 10 drops every 15 -30 minutes in 1 ounce of water. Curcumin ( Curcuma longa ): use companies that have well -studied forms that are well absorbed. Take 2 -3 capsules 3 times per day before meals. Boswellia ( Boswellia serrata ) 400 mg: this is an herb from India that has a long history of use as an anti -inflammatory. Take 1 -2 caps 3 times per day before meals. White willow bark ( Salix alba ) 400 mg: this herb contains salicin, a component similar to that found in aspirin. Take 1 -2 caps 3 times per day before meals. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Managing Herxheimer Reactions Alkalizing your body will also help keep Herxing under control. You can take a bicarbonate formula to help keep you more alkaline. I recommend taking: Alka Seltzer Gold: take 1 tablet 3 -4 times per day in 2-4 ounces of water and drink. Tri-Salts: 2 capsules 3 times per day. Baking soda: \u00bc tsp 3 -4 times per day. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Breaking Down Biofilm Biofilm is produced by many bacteria, including Lyme and is composed of extracellular DNA, proteins and carbohydrates ...AKA \"slime\". Biofilm enhances microbial adhesion to host cells and to each other. Biofilm protects the microbe against innate and humoral immune responses and can lead to antibiotic resistance. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Breaking Down Biofilm Biofilm busting enzymes -there are several products that contain enzymes that will help digest the biofilm and break it down. I use serrapeptase a lot and find it works well. I give between 40,000 - 60,000 U per day away from food. Nattokinase is another enzyme derived from natto, a fermented soy product. I give 20,000 FU 2 -3 times per day away from food. For more difficult patients, I often use lumbrokinase, an enzyme derived from a type of earthworm. The enzyme activity is about 10 times that of nattokinase, but is also significantly more expensive. I specifically use Boluoke, as it has the best research behind it. Take 1 capsule 2 times per day, which delivers 600,000 U per day in total. Interfase Plus: this product contains enzymes with the addition of disodium EDTA and chitosans that also help break down biofilm. Take 1 -2 capsules twice a day between meals. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Breaking Down Biofilm Lactoferrin: this molecule binds up iron, which effectively prevents the formation of biofilm. Be careful if patient is already iron deficient or anemic. It is also not be to be taken if they have a dairy allergy, as it is derived from dairy and could worsen symptoms. Take 600 mg 1 -2 times per day. Xylitol: this is a low carbohydrate sweetener that is naturally found in low amounts in some fruits and vegetables. It has been shown to make the biofilm weaker in dental studies. Although it is safe for humans, it is extremely toxic to dogs, so avoiding keeping around pets. Give 1 tsp 3 -4 times a day in water or juice to start and you can increase up to 1 Tbsp. 3 -4 times a day. Some people get gas and bloating with xylitol, so you may have to ramp up the dose slowly. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Breaking Down Biofilm Coconut oil (organic): coconut oil has been used to treat various infections, including bacterial and yeast infections and contains a compound called monolaurin. It also has the ability to disrupt biofilm formation. Give 1Tbsp twice a day in food. N-acetyl cysteine (NAC): this is an amino acid that has been used to help break up mucus in the body and has been shown in numerous studies to break up biofilm. Give 200 -600 mg 3 times per day. NAC may deplete zinc and copper when used long-term, so I recommend supplementing with these minerals if you take NAC for more than 2 months. NAC can cause gastrointestinal distress in some individuals and should not be taken by anyone with an active stomach ulcer. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Boosting Immune Function 1.Vitamin C: vitamin C helps with active infections and may help improve the effect of antibiotics. Test tube studies show large doses of vitamin C may inhibit the growth of bacteria or kill it altogether. Take 1000 mg 2 -3 times per day. 1.Vitamin D: many Lyme patients are vitamin D deficient. Vitamin D is a hormone that helps modulate the immune system. Give 2000 -4000 IU per day with food. Higher doses may be needed if serum 25 -hydroxy vitamin D is still low after supplementation. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Boosting Immune Function 3.Zinc: It is an effective anti -viral and anti -inflammatory nutrient. Give 30 -50 mg per day with food. It is essential to take zinc with food or it can make patient nauseous if they take it on an empty stomach. Long -term use of zinc supplements can induce a deficiency of folate or copper. 4.Andrographis ( Andrographis paniculata ) is a potent anti - microbial and anti -inflammatory herb. I prefer using an encapsulated standardized extract. I recommend taking 300 - 400 mg twice a day of a 50% andrographolide product. Andrographis is not for people with autoimmune conditions that are not related to Lyme disease, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis as it may exacerbate their symptoms. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN) Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist, but at low doses appears to enhance endogenous opioid production. Short term blocking of opioid receptors for 4 -6 hours leads to increased levels of endogenous opioids for up to 20 hours.

Think of pushing a child on a swing, then when you push in the direction the child is moving, they go higher. If you push in the opposite direction, it will slow or stop the child's motion. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Pulsed Electro -Magnetic Frequencies (PEMF) PEMF devices are designed to produce a series of very low electromagnetic frequencies that fall within a biological window that resonate with human cells. There are over 1 million receptor on any given cell and applying the right EMF may help stimulate these receptors to alter cellular function. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Pulsed Electro -Magnetic Frequencies (PEMF) Our bodies are exposed to numerous EMF daily via WiFi, electrical wiring in home or office, cell phones, cordless phones, etc. Some of the frequencies can be damaging, while others are healing. The goal is to find the right frequencies that help stimulate the body toward better health. Most of medicine focuses on the chemistry of the body and virtually ignores the physics of the body. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Pulsed Electro -Magnetic Frequencies (PEMF) Potential benefits include: Improved circulation Decreased pain Reduced inflammation Faster recovery after injury or surgery Faster healing of skin wounds Acceleration of nerve regeneration Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Pulsed Electro -Magnetic Frequencies (PEMF) There are over 1600 studies on the use of PEMF devices and most devices are currently FDA approved in the US. Some devices are designed for home use and others for professional use. I recommend 2 treatments per week. Each treatment can be short (8 minutes) to longer (75 minutes). This is a great, non-invasive approach that can be customized to the individual. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Detoxification Therapies IR Sauna Constitutional hydrotherapy Drainage remedies (Unda, Pekana, Marco Pharma, Seroyal) Exercise (gentle): yoga, tai chi, stretching, etc. Colon hydrotherapy Even the most difficult Lyme patient can respond to these therapies, even when others have failed! Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Low Dose Immunotherapy (LDI): developed by Dr. Ty Vincent We recognize that many microorganisms can trigger an autoimmune reactions once someone has been exposed to that organism. Rheumatic fever following strep infection is well -known in the medical community as a consequence of having had strep, even once the infection is eradicated. Molecular mimicry of a microbe can create an autoimmune reaction against our own tissues. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Low Dose Immunotherapy (LDI) If a microorganism is capable of turning on the immune system against our own tissues, how effective will antimicrobial therapy be? Reducing the load of the microbe may certainly lessen the immune response, but does it completely stop an autoimmune reaction? Does this explain why people flare periodically, even though they have been undergoing antimicrobial therapy for months or years? Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Low Dose Immunotherapy (LDI) The goal of LDI is to promote tolerance to the offending antigen using homeopathic doses of nosodes mixed with beta-glucuronidase. Beta-glucuronidase is an enzyme that was found (by mistake) to help build immune tolerance to whatever coexisted with the enzyme. This enzyme has been used with low dose allergy (LDA) therapy for the treatment of allergies to foods, mold, pollens and chemicals. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Low Dose Immunotherapy (LDI) The antigen is selected by the doctor depending on what organism(s) are suspicious to be causing symptoms. The dose selected is dependent on the sensitivity of the individual. Intradermal or sublingual doses are administered every 7-8 weeks depending on patient response. In many cases, clinical improvement has been observed within 24-48 hours. However, it can take a few weeks to see the full benefit of the treatment dose. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Low Dose Immunotherapy (LDI): Case 1 15 year old girl with autism Jill has been in treatment with autism since she was 2 years old doing various biomedical and immune modulating therapies, all of which have helped to varying degrees. Her current primary issues are scripting, hyperactivity and lack of focus. She has also has intermittent skin rashes. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Low Dose Immunotherapy (LDI): Case 1 15 year old girl with autism Jill had been tested for Lyme disease and coinfections, which none of the tests were positive. She had a history of candidiasis however and had been on antifungal therapy for many years. I gave Jill Candida Mix 10C sublingually. The next day, her mother called and said that she was completely calm and more mentally \"clear\". The scripting was less and her skin was not as itchy. After 2 months, she is stable and has not regressed. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Low Dose Immunotherapy (LDI): Case 2 9 year old boy with tics John had been having vocal and neck tics for a few months when the mother brought him to our clinic. He was tested and treated for food allergies, which helped reduce his tics significantly. However, the tics had not completely resolved. I tested him for PANDAS and he was positive for ASO and DNAse B antibodies, despite having had a negative throat culture. He had a history of Lyme disease when he was 3 -4 years old, which was treated with antibiotics at the time. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Low Dose Immunotherapy (LDI): Case 2 9 year old boy with tics I gave John a Strep Mix 10C and the mother reported no noticeable changes. I gave him a Strep Mix 9C the following week and again, no noticeable changes in his tics. I then tried the Lyme Mix 10C and that following day he had a severe headache. The following day, the headache dissipated and the tics completely stopped. He has now been tic -free for 3 months Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Low Dose Immunotherapy (LDI): Case 3 47 year old woman with Lyme disease Susan had a h/o chronic neck and shoulder pain, fatigue and joint pain. She had seen several doctors, including a rheumatologist who ran many labs for autoimmune disease, which were all negative. Went to a large autoimmune clinic in TX and was put on AI diet and Rx many supplements, which helped, but did not resolve her Sx. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Low Dose Immunotherapy (LDI): Case 3 47 year old woman with Lyme disease Susan was tested for Lyme and coinfections and found to have a + Lyme Western Blot IgG and IgM. She was referred to my office for Tx. I started her on an alkaline diet, Dr. Zhang protocol and gave her LDI Lyme 12C. She reported the next day her neck pain had improved by 90%. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Low Dose Immunotherapy (LDI): Case 3 47 year old woman with Lyme disease Over the next month, her neck and joint pain almost completely resolved. Her energy was better and she was becoming more physically active again. She was doing well for about 6 months and then started to have RUQ pain. She had U/S and MRCP which showed dilated common bile duct, but otherwise negative for cholecystitis or obstruction. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Low Dose Immunotherapy (LDI): Case 3 47 year old woman with Lyme disease Over the next month, her neck and joint pain almost completely resolved. Her energy was better and she was becoming more physically active again. She was doing well for about 6 months and then started to have RUQ pain. She denies irregular BM, constipation or diarrhea. She had U/S and MRCP which showed dilated common bile duct, but otherwise negative for cholecystitis or obstruction. CDSA was unremarkable, except no yeast growth. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease Low Dose Immunotherapy (LDI): Case 3 47 year old woman with Lyme disease I then gave her LDI Candida 12C and her abdominal pain was 50% improved within 48 hours. I saw her 2 weeks later and gave her a booster dose of Candida 13C, which continued to help her Sx. After a second dose of Candida 12C, her RUQ pain is gone. She is currently doing well and RUQ pain has not returned. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDTreatment of Lyme Disease The treatment of LD cannot be a single treatment approach. It is a complicated illness and the treatment needs to encompass many aspects of improving immune health. 1. Treat the organism(s) if it is acute. 2. Treat other immune distracters such as food allergies, environmental allergies, etc. 3. Detoxify the body. Eliminate heavy metals. 4. Fix endocrine dysregulation. 5. Get proper sleep. 6. Reduce inflammation. 7. Improve nutritional status. 8. Improve mitochondrial function. 9. Improve circulation. 10. Reduce autoimmunity. Lyme Paradox 2/3/18: Darin Ingels, NDThe Lyme Solution Lyme "}
