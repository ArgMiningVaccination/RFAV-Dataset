A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if, at the time of such conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect such person was incapable of knowing and appreciating the nature, quality, or wrongfulness of such person's conduct. 2. Evidence of mental disease or defect excluding respo nsibility shall not be admissible at trial of the accused unless the accused, at the time of entering such accused's plea to the charge, pleads not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect excluding responsibility, or unless within ten days after a ple a of not Sixty -First Day - Tuesday, May 2, 2023 1987 guilty, or at such later date as the court may for good cause permit, the accused files a written notice of such accused's purpose to rely on such defense. Such a plea or notice shall not deprive the accused of other defenses. The state may accept a defense of mental disease or defect excluding responsibility, whether raised by plea or written notice, if the accused has no other defense and files a written notice to that effect. The state shall not accept a defense of mental disease or defect exclu ding responsibility in the absence of any pretrial evaluation as described in this section or section 552.020. Upon the state's acceptance of the defense of mental disease or defect excluding responsibility, the court shall proceed to order the commitment of the accused as provided in section 552.040 in cases of persons acquitted on the ground of mental disease or defect excluding responsibility, and further proceedings shall be had regarding the confinement and release of the accused as provided in section 552.040. 3. Whenever the accused has pleaded mental disease or defect excluding responsibility or has given the written notice provided in subsection 2 of this section, and such defense has not been accepted as provided in subsection 2 of this section, the court shall, after notice and upon motion of either the state or the accused, by order of record, appoint one or more private psychiatrists or psychologists, as defined in section 632.005, or physicians with a minimum of one year training or experience in providin g treatment or services to persons with an intellectual disability or developmental disability or mental illness, who are neither employees nor contractors of the department of mental health for purposes of performing the examination in question, to examin e the accused, or shall direct the director of the department of mental health, or the director's designee, to have the accused so examined by one or more psychiatrists or psychologists, as defined in section 632.005, or physicians with a minimum of one ye ar training or experience in providing treatment or services to persons with an intellectual disability or developmental disability or mental illness designated by the director, or the director's designee, as qualified to perform examinations pursuant to t his chapter. The order shall direct that written report or reports of such examination be filed with the clerk of the court. No private psychiatrist, psychologist, or physician shall be appointed by the court unless such psychiatrist, psychologist or physi cian has consented to act. The examinations ordered shall be made at such time and place and under such conditions as the court deems proper; except that, if the order directs the director of the department of mental health to have the accused examined, th e director, or the director's designee, shall determine the time, place and conditions under which the examination shall be conducted. The order may include provisions for the interview of witnesses and may require the provision of police reports to the de partment for use in evaluation. If an examination provided in section 552.020 was made and the report of such examination included an opinion as to whether, at the time of the alleged criminal conduct, the accused, as a result of mental disease or defect, did not know or appreciate the nature, quality or wrongfulness of such accused's conduct or as a result of mental disease or defect was incapable of conforming such accused's conduct to the requirements of law, such report may be received in evidence, and no new examination shall be required by the court unless, in the discretion of the court, another examination is necessary.

No statement made by the accused in the course of any such examination and no information received by any physician or other person in the course thereof, whether such examination was made with or without the consent of the accused or upon the accused's motion or upon that of others, shall be admitted in evidence against the accused on the issue of whether the accused committed the act charged again st the accused in any criminal proceeding then or thereafter pending in any court, state or federal. The statement or information shall be admissible in evidence for or against the accused only on the issue of the accused's mental condition, whether or not it would otherwise be deemed to be a privileged communication. If the statement or information is admitted for or against the accused on the issue of the accused's mental condition, the court shall, both orally at the time of its admission and later by instruction, inform the jury that it must not consider such statement or information as any evidence of whether the accused committed the act charged against the accused. 6. All persons are presumed to be free of mental disease or defect excluding responsibi lity for their conduct, whether or not previously adjudicated in this or any other state to be or to have been sexual or social psychopaths, or incompetent; provided, however, the court may admit evidence presented at such adjudication based on its probati ve value. The issue of whether any person had a mental disease or defect excluding responsibility for such person's conduct is one for the trier of fact to decide upon the introduction of substantial evidence of lack of such responsibility. But, in the abs ence of such evidence, the presumption shall be conclusive. Upon the introduction of substantial evidence of lack of such responsibility, the presumption shall not disappear and shall alone be sufficient to take that issue to the trier of fact. The jury sh all be instructed as to the existence and nature of such presumption when requested by the state and, where the issue of such responsibility is one for the jury to decide, the jury shall be told that the burden rests upon the accused to show by a preponder ance or greater weight of the credible evidence that the defendant was suffering from a mental disease or defect excluding responsibility at the time of the conduct charged against the defendant. At the request of the defense the jury shall be instructed by the court as to the contents of subsection 2 of section 552.040. 7.

The court shall also order custody and care in a state mental health or intellectual disability facility unless an immediate conditional release is granted pursuant to this section. If the accused has not been charged with a dangerous fel ony as defined in section 556.061, or with murder in the first degree pursuant to section 565.020, or sexual assault pursuant to section 566.040, or the attempts thereof, and the examination contains an opinion that the accused should be immediately condit ionally released to the community by the court, the court shall hold a hearing to determine if an immediate conditional release is appropriate pursuant to the procedures for conditional release set out in subsections 10 to 14 of this section. Prior to the hearing, the court shall direct the director of the department of mental health, or the director's designee, to have the accused examined to determine conditions of confinement in accordance with subsection [4] 5 of section 552.020. The provisions of subse ction 16 of this section shall be applicable to defendants granted an immediate conditional release and the director shall honor the immediate conditional release as granted by the court. If the court determines that an immediate conditional release is war ranted, the court shall order the person committed to the director of the department of mental health before ordering such a release. The court granting the immediate conditional release shall retain jurisdiction over the case for the duration of the condi tional release. This shall not limit the authority of the director of the department of mental health or the director's designee to revoke the conditional release or the trial release of any committed person pursuant to subsection 17 of this section. If th e accused is committed to a mental health or developmental disability facility, the director of the department of mental health, or the director's designee, shall determine the time, place and conditions of confinement. 3. The provisions of to persons committed pursuant to subsection 2 of this section. If the department does not have a treatment or rehabilitation program for a mental disease or defect of an individual, that fact may not be the basis for a release from commitment. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no person committed to the department of mental health who has been tried and acquitted by reason of mental disease or defect as provided in section 552.030 shall be conditionally or unconditionally released unless the procedures set out in this section are followed. Upon request by an indige nt committed person, the appropriate court may appoint the office of the public defender to represent such person in any conditional or unconditional release proceeding under this section. 4. Notwithstanding section 630.115, any person committed pursuant t o subsection 2 of this section shall be kept in a secure facility until such time as a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order granting a conditional or unconditional release to a nonsecure facility. 1990 Journal of the Senate 5.

Any party objecting to the proposed release must do so in writing within thirty days after service. Within a reasonable period of time after any written objection is filed, which period shall not exceed sixty days unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties, the court shall hold a hearing upon notice to the committed person, th e head of the facility, if necessary, the director of the department of mental health, and the prosecutor of the jurisdiction where the person was tried. Prior to the hearing any of the parties, upon written application, shall be entitled to an examination of the committed person, by a psychiatrist or psychologist, as defined in section 632.005, or a physician with a minimum of one year training or experience in providing treatment or services to intellectually disabled or mentally ill individuals of its ow n choosing and at its expense. The report of the mental condition of the committed person shall accompany the application. By agreement of all parties to the proceeding any report of the mental condition of the committed person which may accompany the appl ication for release or which is filed in objection thereto may be received by evidence, but the party contesting any opinion therein shall have the right to summon and to cross -examine the examiner who rendered such opinion and to offer evidence upon the i ssue. 6. By agreement of all the parties and leave of court, the hearing may be waived, in which case an order granting an unconditional release shall be entered in accordance with subsection 8 of this section. 7.

An order denying the application shall be without prejudice to the filing of another application after the expiration of one year from the denial of the last application. 9. No committed person shall be unconditionally released unless it is determined through the procedures in this section that the person does not have, and in the reasonable future is not likely to have, a mental disease or defect rendering the person dangerous to the safety of himsel f or others. 10. The committed person or the head of the facility where the person is committed may file an application in the court having probate jurisdiction over the facility where the person is detained for a hearing to determine whether the committed person shall be released conditionally.

Upon the introduction of substantial evidence of lack of such responsibility, the presumption shall not disappear and shall alone be sufficient to take that issue to the trier of fact. The jury shall be instructed as to the existence and nature of such presumption when requested by the state and, where the issue of such responsibility is one for the jury to decide, the jury shall be told that the burden rests upon the accused to show by a preponderance or greater weight of the credible evidence that the defendant was suffering from a mental disease or defect excluding responsibility at the time of the conduct charged against the defenda nt. At the request of the defense the jury shall be instructed by the court as to the contents of subsection 2 of section 552.040. 7. When the accused is acquitted on the ground of mental disease or defect excluding responsibility, the verdict and the judg ment shall so state as well as state the offense for which the accused was acquitted. The clerk of the court shall furnish a copy of any judgment or order of commitment to the department of mental health pursuant to this section to the criminal records cen tral repository pursuant to section 43.503. 552.040. 1.

When an accused is tried and acquitted on the ground of mental disease or defect excluding responsibility, the court shall orde r such person committed to the director of the department of mental health for custody. The court shall also order custody and care in a state mental health or intellectual disability facility unless an immediate conditional release is granted pursuant to this section. If the accused has not been charged with a dangerous felony as defined in section 556.061, or with murder in the first degree pursuant to section 565.020, or sexual assault pursuant to section 566.040, or the attempts thereof, and the examination contains an opinion that the accused should be immediately conditionally released to the community by the court, the court shall hold a hearing to determine if an immediate conditional release is appropriate pursuant to the procedures for conditional release set out in subsections 10 to 14 of this section. Prior to the hearing, the court shall direct the director of the department of mental health, or the director's designee, to have the accused examined to determine conditions of confinement in accord ance with subsection [ 4] 5 of section 552.020. The provisions of subsection 16 of this section shall be applicable to defendants granted an immediate conditional release and the director shall honor the immediate conditional release as granted by the court . If the court determines that an immediate conditional release is warranted, the court shall order the person committed to the director of the department of mental health before ordering such a release. The court granting the immediate conditional release shall retain jurisdiction over the case for the duration of the conditional release. This shall not limit the authority of the director of the department of mental health or the director's designee to revoke the conditional release or the trial release of any committed person pursuant to subsection 17 of this section. If the accused is committed to a mental health or developmental disability facility, the director of the department of mental health, or the director's designee, shall determine the time, pla ce and conditions of confinement. 3. The provisions comm itted pursuant to subsection 2 of this section. If the department does not have a treatment or rehabilitation program for a mental disease or defect of an individual, that fact may not be the basis for a release from commitment. Notwithstanding any other p rovision of law to the contrary, no person committed to the department of mental health who has been tried and acquitted by reason of mental disease or defect as provided in section 552.030 shall be conditionally or unconditionally released unless the proc edures set out in this section are followed.

In the case of a person who was immediately conditionally released after being committed to the department of mental health, the released person or the director of the department of mental health, or the director's designee, may file an application in the same court that released the committed perso n seeking an order releasing the committed person unconditionally. Copies Sixty -First Day - Tuesday, May 2, 2023 2041 of the application shall be served personally or by certified mail upon the head of the facility unless the head of the facility files the application, the committed person unless the committed person files the application, or unless the committed person was immediately conditionally released, the director of the department of mental health, and the prosecutor of the jurisdiction where the committed person was tried and acquitted. Any party objecting to the proposed release must do so in writing within thirty days after service. Within a reasonable period of time after any written objection is filed, which period shall not exceed sixty days unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties, the court shall hold a hearing upon notice to the committed person, the head of the facility, if necessary, the director of the department of mental health, and the prosecutor of the jurisdiction where the person was tried. Prior to the hearing any of the parties, upon written application, shall be entitled to an examination of the committed person, by a psychiatrist or psychologist, as defined in section 632.005, or a physician with a minimum of one year training or experience in providing treatment or ser vices to intellectually disabled or mentally ill individuals of its own choosing and at its expense. The report of the mental condition of the committed person shall accompany the application. By agreement of all parties to the proceeding any report of the mental condition of the committed person which may accompany the application for release or which is filed in objection thereto may be received by evidence, but the party contesting any opinion therein shall have the right to summon and to cross -examine t he examiner who rendered such opinion and to offer evidence upon the issue. 6. By agreement of all the parties and leave of court, the hearing may be waived, in which case an order granting an unconditional release shall be entered in accordance with subse ction 8 of this section. 7.

The burden of persuasion for any person committed to a mental health facility under the provisions of this section upon acquittal on the grounds of mental disease or defect excluding responsibility shall be on the party seeking unconditional release to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the person for whom unconditional release is sought does not have, and in the reasonable future is not likely to have, a mental disease or defect rendering the person dangerous to the safety of himself or others. 8. The court shall enter an order either denying the application for unconditional release or granting an unconditional release. An order denying the application shall be without prejudice to the filing of another application after the expiration of one year from the denial of the last application. 2042 Journal of the Senate 9. No committed person shall be unconditionally released unless it is determined through the procedures in this section that the person does not have, and in the reasonable future is not likely to have, a mental di sease or defect rendering the person dangerous to the safety of himself or others. 10. The committed person or the head of the facility where the person is committed may file an application in the court having probate jurisdiction over the facility where t he person is detained for a hearing to determine whether the committed person shall be released conditionally.

If the application for release was required to be filed in the committing court, the prosecutor of the jurisdiction where the person was tried and acquitted shall represent the public safety interest. In the case of a person who was immediately conditionally released after being committed to the department of mental health, the prosecutor of the jurisdiction where the person was tried and acquitted shall appear and represent the public safety interest. 11. By agreement of all the parties, the hearing may be waived, in which case an order granting a conditional release, stating the conditions and duration agreed upon by all the parties and the court, shall be entered in accordance wit h subsection 13 of this section. 12.

The court shall enter an order either denying the application for a conditional release or granting conditional release. An order denying the application shall be without prejudice to the filing of another application after the expiration of one year from the denial of the last application. 14.

No peace officer responsible for apprehending and returning the committed person to the facility upon the request of the director or coordinator shall be civilly liable for apprehending or transporting such patient to the facility so long as such duties were performed in good faith and without negligence. If a person on conditional release is returned to a facility under the provisions of this subsection, a hearing shall be held within ninety -six hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and state holidays, to determine whether the p erson violated the conditions of the release or whether resumption of full -time hospitalization is the least restrictive alternative consistent with the person's needs and public safety. The director of the department of mental health, or the director's de signee, shall conduct the hearing. The person shall be given notice at least twenty -four hours in advance of the hearing and shall have the right to have an advocate present. 18.
