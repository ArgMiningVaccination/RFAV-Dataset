About Optimum Wellness Optimum Wellness Pharmacy is different kind of pharmacy Pharmacist Mark Haywood and Lewis Kivett, PharmD are using their knowledge to help people feel better, live longer, and be more energetic through the use of consultation, customized medications (compounding of medicines), and natural medicines. Mark Haywood is a graduate of St. Louis College of Pharmacy. After working 15 years in various independent and chain pharmacies, Mark realized patients being treated with only traditional medicines were not achieving optimal wellness. Since traditional medicine makes up only a small percentage of treatments that are actually available, Mark began studying natural medicines, homeopathy, and integrative medicine to help get to the underlying cause of patient's aliments . The combination of customized medications, natural medicines, and in depth consultation while working closely with the patient's physician became the obvious choice. Lewis Kivett graduated from Creighton University with his Doctorate in Pharmacy (PharmD). Lewis worked with a local independent pharmacy, until it recently sold to a chain drug store. Lewis is certified by the American Pharmacist Association in Medication Therapy Management. Lewis wanted to play a bigger role with more of an impact on patients than most traditional pharmacies will allow. Mark Haywood, RPh Owner St. Louis College of Pharmacy, Class of '01.
