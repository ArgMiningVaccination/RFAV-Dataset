The [holistic health field recognizes the totality of the human being](/holistic-health/), integrating natural healing with clinical practice to treat people's physiological, psychological and spiritual needs. Similarly, this type of nursing helps to complement more traditional methods for a well-rounded, complementary approach. What is a holistic nurse? A holistic nurse is a board-certified registered nurse (RN) who incorporates a mind-body-spirit-emotion approach to patient care\u2014akin to the philosophy of [holistic medicine schools](/holistic-health/holistic-medicine-schools/). To assist patients in maintaining a healthy balance of mind, body, and spirit, these nurses frequently urge patients to include self-care, self-responsibility, spirituality, and introspection in their lives. A holistic approach to nursing care focuses on treating the patient as a whole rather than only addressing the symptoms of their current disease. Holistic nursing care approach patients from a different angle and look at their lifestyles to find clues about how to enhance their overall health and wellness rather than treating a specific problem. Holistic nurse practitioners often incorporate complementary therapies into patient care, relying on eastern and western medical traditions, such as [aromatherapy](https://www.naturalhealers.com/blog/aromatherapy-career/). In addition, they employ holistic medicine, not just as a treatment method but to prevent disease, as well. It operates under the idea that a person's complete physical and mental well-being can reduce their risk of becoming ill. Core principles of holistic nursing The [American Holistic Nurses Association (AHNA)](https://www.ahna.org/) defines the following principles as the bedrock of holistic nursing: What does a holistic nurse do? Registered and holistic nurses undertake the same tasks, including running tests, identifying illnesses, and managing patients, but a holistic nurse practitioner has additional responsibilities to aid the patient's physical, emotional and spiritual recovery. Firstly, they [combine Eastern and Western medical approaches](/blog/integrative-health-centers/) in hopes of improving patient care and boosting the body's natural healing processes. Additionally, they assist patients in finding the alternative therapy that is most appropriate for them. They also assist in controlling patient stress and anxiety. Although excellent holistic nurses possess the same professional abilities as typical RNs, the deeper connection a holistic nurse practitioner strives to establish with patients sets them apart. They understand their problems, pay close attention to detail, are observant, kind, good listeners, view patients as a whole, and place equal focus on patients' emotional and physical health. In a holistic context, a nurse sees a health problem as a reflection of how individuals live and care for themselves. So when they engage with their patients, they look at the health condition and the entire lifestyle that contributes to it. Then, to help heal and avoid recurrence, they suggest various measures to alleviate the issue, such as dietary adjustments, stress-relieving workouts, and more. Where do they work? Holistic nurse practitioners find career possibilities in patients' homes, clinics, hospitals, and primary care facilities. Those working in 24-hour hospitals and private clinics may find themselves working late at night, early in the morning, or on the weekends. Additionally, to suit patient schedules, nurses who care for patients in their homes sometimes have to work late into the night or on the weekends. Medical offices are often open during regular business hours. With this, holistic nurses working in them will likely have a more predictable daily routine. A holistic nurse practitioner can also work with the government, social service organizations, or educational institutions. Holistic nurses may also practice in hospice care facilities, where they use holistic medicine to treat terminally ill patients at the end of their lives. Becoming a holistic nurse As with other registered nurses, you must complete a few steps before becoming certified as a holistic nurse, including earning an Associate Degree in Nursing (ADN) or a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree. Getting experience in healthcare and growing used to the workplace are two crucial steps in becoming a holistic nurse.

Finally, holistic nurses must pass the NCLEX-RN before applying for a license and practicing. Employers often prefer those with a bachelor's degree, and it may be beneficial to go a step further to earn a Master's of Science in Nursing (MSN). Although earning your MSN it isn't strictly necessary to practice as a holistic nurse, registered nurses who want to specialize in the profession often do so.
