But the adolescents most in need are also the hardest to reach: young men and women who have never attended school or have left because of early pregnancy or to help support their families. In 2000, the African Y outh Alliance (AYA)\u2014implemented by PATH, Pathfinder International, and the United Nations Population Fund, in partnership with more than 60 local agencies\u2014launched a comprehensive program designed to i n g l o b a l h e a l t h continued on page 10august 2005 Volume 2, issue 2 INSIDE: Vitamin a deficiency 2 Vulnerable populations 4 Rapid syphilis tests 6 home-based care 8 mark edwards\u0018 Identifying vitamin A deficiency New test for measuring prevalenceInformation is the first step toward prevention and treatment of severe vitamin A deficiency (V AD). V AD puts an estimated 100 million children in 118 countries at risk of blindness or death,1 in part because governments and other public health decision-makers do not have good estimates of its prevalence in the populations they serve. A number of strategies are available to prevent V AD\u2014what is missing is an affordable and easy-to-use test that can provide the information needed to guide their application and measure their effectiveness. PATH has developed an enzyme immunoassay for detecting V AD that is less costly and gives results more rapidly than the currently used method; that can be performed on standard laboratory equipment; and that uses samples obtained by fingerstick, rather than by a more invasive venipuncture. It should provide developing countries with a more acceptable and appropriate tool for measuring the impact of V AD in populations at risk. A new approach to detection The standard way to identify V AD is to use high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to measure levels of retinol in venous blood. This process requires specialized laboratory facilities with skilled staff. It can take months for specimens to be obtained, transported to a laboratory with the necessary capacity, and analyzed. Costs are often high, and samples can be damaged during transport and storage. The assay developed by PATH measures levels of retinol-binding protein\u2014a surrogate marker for retinol that is more stable and easier to detect in small samples. The retinol-binding protein enzyme immunoassay (RBP-EIA) offers several advantages over the traditional HPLC assay: It can be carried out using standard laboratory equipment. It requires only a small sample, which can be obtained from capillary blood. The required blood can be collected through a fingerstick\u2014a method that is less invasive and requires less technical skill than venipuncture. The associated equipment, training, and skill needed are much less than for HPLC, and therefore the cost of the test is much lower. It yields results in less than 40 minutes. The test is packaged as a kit, with controls and a set of strip wells that can be read on a portable EIA reader, for ease of use in the field. RBP-EIA: a valid alternative Laboratory and field studies conducted in Tanzania and Cambodia have demonstrated that RBP-EIA is a reliable and accurate tool for estimating V AD Project name Retinol-binding protein enzyme immunoassay Locations Cambodia, Guinea Bissau, Nicaragua, Senegal, Tan- zania, Thailand, Zimbabwe Methods Technology development and commercialization Partners Helen Keller International; Institute of Nutrition of Central America and Panama; Johns Hopkins University; London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine; Mahidol University; MOST; Scimedx; Tanzania National Institute of Medical Research; University of California, Davis; University of Massachusetts; University of Washington; US Agency for International Development (USAID) Funder USAID (for PATH's HealthTech program) For more information Please contact Tala de los Santos, senior commercialization associate, at tdelossantos@path.org. A new test offers a reliable and cost-effective way to measure the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency in the developing world\u2014 information that is vital in targeted efforts to reduce malnutrition.Path (glenn austin)\u0018TECHNOLOGIESprevalence in populations, and a good alternative to HPLC with serum retinol.2 In one evaluation, which used samples from children in Cambodia, the prevalence measured by RBP-EIA was 20.2 percent, and the prevalence measured by HPLC was 20.4 percent\u2014a statistically insignificant difference.3 To confirm these results and test another aspect of the RBP-EIA\u2014the use of capillary blood instead of venous blood\u2014PATH, the University of Washington, and Thailand's Institute of Nutrition at Mahidol University conducted an additional evaluation of the RBP-EIA in 2004. The study included 195 children aged 1 through 5 years (the age group most affected by V AD) from Om Koi and Mae Cham districts in Thailand. Study coordinators selected Thailand because it has laboratory capacity adequate for reliable testing and met other requirements, such as significant population levels of V AD. The focus of this evaluation was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of RBP-EIA using capillary blood, with HPLC in venous blood as the reference standard. Using the standard cutoff point for V AD (<0.70 \u00b5mol of retinol per liter of blood), the sensitivity of the test was 64 percent, and the specificity was 99 percent. Use of a higher cutoff point (0.825 \u00b5mol/L) increases the sensitivity to 86 percent. These results are the first evidence that venous blood and capillary blood are comparable for measuring V AD. New sample types and commercialization PATH has also evaluated whether dried blood spots can be used in the RBP-EIA. Dried blood spots are easy to collect and very stable, when handled and stored properly. Results from experiments using samples from Zimbabwe and Guinea Bissau demonstrated a good correlation between the results of RBP-EIA with dried blood spots and serum retinol. PATH has licensed the RBP-EIA technology to Scimedx, a commercial diagnostics company in the United States, which has made significant progress toward commercial availability and is currently engaged in quality assurance activities. PATH and Scimedx are working closely with researchers and public health staff in developing countries to ensure that the test is used properly by providing technical support and developing training guides and toolkits to accompany the tests. Once the RBP-EIA is available, we expect that it will facilitate national vitamin A assessments and increase the number of countries that will be able to conduct V AD prevalence surveys\u2014allowing those countries to respond to the needs of children who are affected by this deficiency.

Targeting vulnerable populations in Georgia HIV prevention efforts aim to curtail epidemicNowhere is HIV spreading faster than in Eastern Europe, where social and economic instability is fostering drug use and commercial sex. Although HIV rates in Georgia currently are low, both commercial sex work and injection drug use are on the rise, and most new infections occur among people who engage in these activities.1 By working with these vulnerable groups, Georgia has an opportunity to stave off HIV and AIDS and help curtail a national epidemic. To help control sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV , PATH collaborates with Save the Children and local organizations on the STI and HIV Prevention (SHIP) Project, implemented in Georgia's two largest cities, Tbilisi and Batumi. PATH has conducted formative research for the project, helped develop educational materials, and provided technical assistance in several areas, including training and voluntary counseling and testing (VCT). Positive deviance informs messages Since its inception in May 2002, the project has reached more than 15,000 individuals, most of whom are female sex workers, injection drug users (most of whom are male), prisoners, and others at high risk of HIV and STIs. Outreach activities include peer education, mass media, and distribution of educational materials. The SHIP team has used an especially creative and effective approach to formulate messages to sex workers: \"positive deviance. \" The approach, pioneered by Save the Children, is based on the premise that, within a community, some individuals maintain better health because of certain positive behaviors that differ from Resources for health programs in Georgia The SHIP Project was the first program in Georgia to introduce voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) as a standard component of HIV prevention, and the PATH-developed VCT protocols and training manuals have been adopted by the National AIDS Center. The materials include: Counseling on HIV & AIDS: A Training Manual. This manual features a curriculum for training health workers in VCT. It includes information on the global HIV epidemic; the HIV and AIDS situation in Georgia and Eastern Europe; HIV transmission and prevention; ethical, social, and legal issues for health care workers to consider; effective counseling methods; and prevention of burnout. To order copies, contact publications@path.org. A Guide to Developing Materials on HIV/AIDS and STIs. This guide describes recommended methods for developing print, audiovisual, and mass media materials for almost any population. Based on a manual produced by PATH and Family Health International, the Georgia edition is available in Russian and English at www.path.org.\u0018 HIV AND AIDSthe norm. When peers mimic the divergent behaviors, they achieve similar benefits. During focus group discussions, the SHIP team identified female sex workers who were able to avoid sexual violence and consistently use condoms with their clients. Staff interviewed the sex workers about their attitudes and practices and used what was learned to develop outreach materials. A comic book, for example, tells the story of Natalie, a sex worker who finds herself in difficult situations when a client refuses to pay her and when another client tries to beat her. She seeks advice from her friend Elza, who counsels Natalie about ways to stay safe\u2014such as refusing to ride alone in a car with more than one man, avoiding intoxicated clients, and negotiating condom use before going with a client. After testing the comic book among sex workers who visited counseling clinics, the project team printed and distributed it to women working in saunas, on the streets, and through cell phone networks. One year later, an evaluation indicated that the comic books effectively engaged sex workers and gave them a way to share information with their peers. Building Georgia's capacity for VCT The comic book and other outreach materials also include information encouraging individuals to seek voluntary HIV counseling and testing. People who learn they are seronegative can then be counseled on ways to remain disease-free. Those who are seropositive can obtain other medical and supportive services and learn how to avoid transmitting the infection to others. To ensure that high-quality VCT services are available, PATH developed a curriculum and conducted a series of training workshops for health workers. PATH trained representatives from local nongovernmental organizations and health clinics to provide client-friendly counseling and accurate information. PATH also conducted a series of workshops to train trainers in VCT, ensuring that the number of skilled service providers will expand to meet the growing demand for services. To date, PATH has trained more than 30 trainers who have begun to conduct trainings themselves. Reaching out to others Earlier this year, the SHIP project received a favorable independent evaluation and a two-year extension from the funder. The SHIP team will now expand use of the positive deviance approach to additional populations, such as sailors, and to the city of Kutaisi, as well as to the breakaway region of Abkhazia, where PATH will take the lead in implementation.

Although prevalence rates are high and inexpensive treatment is available, antenatal syphilis screening is sporadic in many countries. The standard syphilis test\u2014a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) assay\u2014is accurate and cost-effective, but it requires well-equipped laboratories and trained workers. Newer, rapid diagnostic tests such as the immunochromatographic strip (ICS) test can identify Treponema pallidum antibodies from a drop of fingerstick blood in 15 minutes without laboratory facilities or trained personnel, making testing and treatment possible in a single visit.1 Although they are commercially available, ICS tests are not widely used. To determine which test would be most feasible and affordable for low-resource settings, PATH and its partners are estimating the clinical and economic impact of rapid diagnostic tests in prenatal care clinics. Health Alliance International and the Population Council are leading studies in Mozambique and Bolivia, and PATH is conducting an economic analysis of the study results. Different contexts, different needs In Mozambique, universal syphilis screening has been a national policy since 1979, but screening is inconsistent, especially at the province level. Poor laboratory quality, supply shortages, late prenatal attendance, and low partner notification and treatment rates all contribute to the low screening rates. The study team therefore set out to compare the clinical and economic impact of the ICS and RPR tests in clinics with laboratories and to determine the impact of introducing the ICS test in clinics without laboratories. They worked with over 100 clinics in two provinces. In Bolivia, all women have universal maternal-child insurance, which pays up to 7 Bolivianos (approximately US$1.00) for each syphilis test conducted as part of antenatal care. But most antenatal testing clinics in rural settings lack guidelines and infrastructure for providing screening and treatment for maternal and congenital syphilis. When testing is done, the samples are sent to an off-site laboratory, and results are not available for several days\u2014instead of immediately, so that treatment can be offered at the same visit. One study found that 50 percent of results never get back to the clinic at all.2 The study team therefore compared the feasibility, acceptability, and costs associated with rapid syphilis testing in antenatal care settings in four provinces. They focused on urban maternity hospitals and rural health care centers that lack the infrastructure and personnel to perform traditional syphilis tests. Evaluating costs PATH staff collected cost data from a selection of participating study clinics during four field visits to the two countries in 2003 and 2004. Using a microcosting method, the team collected facility-based data on start-up costs and the cost of the syphilis test, equipment, labor, other required supplies, and treatment. The study team also collected data on the utilization of syphilis screening services (e.g., number of women screened, number of women treated).Project name Cost analysis of rapid syphilis tests in antenatal care clinics Locations Bolivia, Mozambique Method Cost analysis Partners Health Alliance International, Population Council Funder Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation For more information Contact Carol Levin, senior health economist, at clevin@path.org.\u0018 COST ANALYSISNew test increases reach In both Mozambique and Bolivia, introducing rapid syphilis tests increased screening coverage among pregnant women and reduced the risk of congenital syphilis. In both countries, the average costs for the ICS tests were found to be slightly higher than for the RPR. This is primarily due to awareness-raising and training expenses, which diminish significantly one year after introduction. The analysis in Mozambique showed that the ICS test is cost-effective in settings both with and without laboratory services. Introducing the ICS test into clinics where testing was not previously conducted can avert significant disease burden for less than US$1 per woman screened and approximately US$15 per woman screened and treated. The average cost of syphilis testing was higher in Bolivia than in Mozambique, primarily because of higher health care costs and use of a different, more expensive commercial test. The RPR test was slightly more cost-effective than the ICS test in urban hospitals, where antenatal care services provide a range of diagnostic services and laboratories are well-equipped. While ease of use and quality concerns may favor the use of the ICS test in urban settings, the potential for overtreatment of previously infected individuals\u2014who will test positive with the ICS test\u2014must also be considered. In addition to cost data, the demonstration activities had considerable impact on the study participants' health: In Mozambique, the project identified and treated an estimated 10,000 cases of maternal syphilis and more than 1,500 cases of congenital syphilis. In Bolivia, the activities led to a 6 percent increase in prenatal syphilis testing. Programmatic implications In Bolivia, the study results have demonstrated that it is possible to implement rapid syphilis screening in rural areas, which previously was thought to be impossible. The Bolivian Ministry of Health (MOH) is interested in increasing uptake of the rapid tests and is now including them in the universal insurance guidelines. In Mozambique, the presentation of preliminary study findings led to discussions within the MOH to seek ways to integrate essential prenatal care services (like syphilis testing) with new interventions, including prevention of mother-to- child transmission of HIV and malaria treatment. As a result, the MOH has agreed to design, test, and subsequently scale up an integrated prenatal care system for Mozambique that is likely to include syphilis screening and treatment. RefeRences 1.

Many of the 6.3 million adults and children living with HIV and AIDS1 receive their primary care at home, where simple resources that are common at hospitals and health care centers\u2014such as gauze and antiseptics\u2014are difficult to obtain. Hundreds of organizations throughout the country are working to make home- based care (HBC) more effective by providing palliative care kits to caregivers. To assess the current status of HBC and evaluate the feasibility of scaling up the production and distribution of HBC kits, PATH and the Reproductive Health Research Unit (RHRU) of the University of Witwatersrand conducted a study of the feasibility of producing and distributing HBC kits in South Africa. Assessing the need for kits The team conducted a nationwide survey and key informant interviews on topics including kit contents and availability, how the kits are used, who uses them, how the kits are distributed to families in need, and how the kits and the supplies they contain are replenished. In all, 466 questionnaires were sent to HBC organizations in all of South Africa's nine provinces; 215 (46 percent) were returned, primarily from representatives of nongovernmental and community-based organizations. The team also conducted 60 interviews with staff from HBC organizations from each province, government officials who work in this area, and kit manufacturers. A review of available literature on community-based care and support in Africa supplemented these activities. Who uses HBC kits? A variety of HBC kits are used by health care professionals, volunteers, and family members. In many cases, the caregivers are not highly trained. Only 12 percent of the surveyed organizations employ nurses, and although the South African Project name Home-based care kits Location South Africa Methods Quantitative survey, key informant interviews, literature review Partners Reproductive Health Research Unit at the University of Witwatersrand; Department of Health, South Africa Funder Atlantic Philanthropies For more information Please contact Siri Wood, program officer, at swood@path.org. An estimated 800 organizations in South Africa are focusing on home-based care of people living with AIDS. The PATH-RHRU study identified ways to strengthen their efforts. Danny bolin, Presbyterian church (usa)\u0018PALLIATIVE CAREgovernment has developed a standard HBC training course, many community caregivers have not received any training. Kit contents and costs Kit contents vary greatly depending on the HBC organization and the type of user. The study found that the most common and essential kit items were gauze, cotton wool, gloves, antiseptic, aqueous cream, linen savers, and disinfectants. Kits for professional caregivers may also carry items such as pain relief medications, antibiotics, or clinical supplies. Kit prices range from US$25 to US$130. The vast majority of survey respondents stated that their clients cannot afford these costs on their own. Furthermore, the study found that professional caregivers rarely leave HBC kits with the households in which they work. Obtaining and replenishing kits The study team found little evidence of an organized system of distributing supplies and using kits. Some HBC organizations acquire kits or kit supplies from the local department of health or pharmacies, some develop their own kits, and others purchase or receive donated kits from private companies. Most HBC organizations said that replenishing kit supplies was a challenge. Some hospitals, clinics, and other health care organizations carry kit supplies, but approaches to resupply vary from one district or province to another. Staff noted that popular items such as gloves and soap are seldom available and that they spend a disproportionate amount of time trying to access supplies. A need for better coordination The demand for HBC kits in South Africa is strong, and kits are viewed as important resources for AIDS care. Many HBC organizations expressed frustration at not being able to fulfill their clients' need for the kits and higher-quality care. The primary challenges to effective use of the kits were insufficient kit production and distribution networks, an irregular supply chain, and a lack of trained staff. Kits will have the greatest impact when the systems that support their use are well coordinated and target user needs.Turning information into action During the summer of 2005, PATH assembled stakeholders in two provinces to disseminate and discuss these research findings. The meetings stimulated dialogue about ways to improve comprehensive care and support through HBC programs. PATH is now designing a project that will address these needs and help improve the care of patients at home. RefeRence 1. South Africa National Department of Health.

Path (siri Wood/Rani boehlke)10improve sexual and reproductive health among young people ages 10 to 24 years in Botswana, Ghana, Tanzania, and Uganda. Until 2005, when the program wrapped up, PATH's role was to lead AYA 's behavior change activities and the integration of adolescent sexual and reproductive health information into livelihood programs by implementing innovative strategies that meet the unique needs of young people in and out of school. A centerpiece of PATH's program was a highly adaptable curriculum that offers comprehensive information about sexual and reproductive health and can be used to help adolescents develop better self-esteem and learn effective communication, problem-solving, and relationship skills (for example, how to negotiate condom use). The curriculum can be effectively covered by a trained teacher within 40 hours and adapted to both in-school and less formal out-of-school settings. Working with youth through educational systems Primary and secondary schools and vocational training centers are major channels for life-planning skills education. These institutions provide a sustainable structure that allows integration of supplementary curricula into the existing syllabus, strengthening of teachers' skills and willingness to discuss sensitive issues with students, and implementation of long-term school education policies. Primary and secondary schools In Botswana, PATH trained teachers in primary and secondary schools in seven districts to use the life-planning skills curriculum. As of 2004, 8,355 youth in primary and secondary schools had attended these courses. Peer educators carried similar messages to more than 13,000 in-school youth, and community activities (including public dance, drama, and musical performances) emphasizing information about prevention of unintended pregnancy and AIDS reached more than 22,000 youth. The peer educators facilitated in-school and community dialogue, bridging the gap between formal and informal education opportunities. Vocational training centers In 2001, the establishment of a government agency in Zanzibar with responsibility for vocational training opened the door to integration of life-planning skills training and sexual and reproductive health education into the entire system of vocational institutes. As a result in part of AYA 's close collaboration with and support of the Ministry of Y outh, Employment, Women and Children Development, the government legislated a policy requiring that vocational training centers throughout Zanzibar include life-planning skills training in their programs. PATH worked with representatives from the new government division and with heads of 59 of Zanzibar's 70 vocational training centers to develop standards for life- planning skills content. These workshops led to the introduction of pilot programs at six vocational education centers, for which PATH provided materials, technical support, and guidance. During 2004, 19 more centers integrated sexual and reproductive health and life-planning skills training (using the PATH curriculum) into their curricula, based on lessons from the six pilot centers. Reaching out-of-school youth In Uganda, 7 percent of adolescents aged 15 to 19 years and 12 percent of young people aged 20 to 24 years have never attended school.2 These youth lack the access to reproductive health information and services provided by the school system, and therefore their risk of early pregnancy and HIV infection is very high\u2014for example, 60 percent of girls without formal education bear children while they are still teenagers, compared with 33 percent of girls who attend primary school. 3continued from front page Project name African Y outh Alliance Locations Botswana, Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda Methods Behavior change communication, life- planning skills training, working with livelihood programs Partners Pathfinder International, United Nations Population Fund Funder Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation For more information Please contact Colleen Conroy, senior program officer, at cconroy@path-dc.org. 11The value of local connections PATH's connections with local implementing partners and other organizations allowed us to reach youth who were disconnected from traditional routes of communication (for example, through schools and after-school activities). We made contact with potential participants through partners that were already established in communities through their work with young people. Contracts with youth- founded and youth-managed nongovernmental organizations provided local experience in implementing peer education strategies and conducting effective entertainment-education strategies in the region. Replacing formal structure PATH designed a structured life-planning skills training program to provide a reliable source of necessary information and training for out- of-school youth. We collaborated with local partners to organize 20-hour courses based on the PATH curriculum and led by trained youth facilitators. These courses were held at schools, health clinics, and churches\u2014wherever we could offer classes at regular times and places, making it easy for youth to attend. Classes were complemented by entertainment- education activities (including dance and drama performances) that drew young people in, reinforced messages conveyed during the classes, and stimulated community involvement. The semiformal structure offered better quality control, was easily adapted by implementing partners, and allowed us to monitor the information received by participating youth. The courses quickly drew more applicants than there was space to accommodate. An estimated 12,000 Ugandan youth from 96 different sites attended. Sustainability efforts These programs reach youth at a crucial stage in their development, helping to reduce high- risk behaviors and introduce new ideas that can change young people's lives. AYA makes sure that project activities and the curriculum stay up to date by monitoring the results of its programs. The results of a survey that assesses the cumulative effect of the efforts of all AYA partners, which should be available in late 2005, will guide ongoing efforts. Part of PATH's work in all four countries was to build the capacity of implementing partners from the private and government sectors so that the progress made during the program would continue after its end. PATH has left behind a network of teachers who are prepared to teach the life-planning skills curriculum, as well as a group of well-trained youth facilitators. The PATH curriculum has become part of the national curriculum in Uganda, Tanzania, and Zanzibar, and in Uganda, implementing partners are coming together to find ways to continue portions of the work.
