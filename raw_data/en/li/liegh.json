Applicability to offenses committed prior to July 1, 1973. (a) Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, this Criminal Code does not apply to offenses committed prior to July 1, 1973. Prosecutions for offenses committed prior to July 1, 1973, shall be governed by the prior law, which is continued in effect for that purpose, as if this Criminal Code were not in force. For the purpose of this section, an offense was committed prior to July 1, 1973, if any of the elements of the offense occurred prior thereto. (b) In any case pending on or commenced after July 1, 1973, involving an offense committed prior to that date: (1) Procedural provisions of this Criminal Code shall govern, insofar as they are justly applicable and their applicability does not introduce confusion, delay or manifest injustice; (2) Provisions of this Criminal Code according a defense or mitigations shall apply, with the consent of the defendant. (c) Provisions of this Criminal Code governing the treatment and the release or discharge of prisoners, probationers and parolees shall apply to persons under sentence for offenses committed prior to July 1, 1973, except that the minimum or maximum period of their detention or supervision shall in no case be increased, nor shall this Criminal Code affect the substantive or procedural validity of any judgment of conviction entered prior to July 1, 1973, regardless of the fact that appeal time has not run or that an appeal is pending. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 102; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 103. Applicability to offenses committed after July 1, 1973. (a) This Criminal Code establishes the criminal law of this State and governs the construction of and punishment for any offense set forth herein committed after July 1, 1973, as well as the construction and application of any defense to a prosecution for such an offense. (b) Unless otherwise expressly provided, or unless the context otherwise requires, this Criminal Code governs the construction of any offense defined in a statute other than this Criminal Code and committed after July 1, 1973, as well as the construction and application of any defense to a prosecution for such an offense. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 103; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1.)Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 2Part I Delaware Criminal Code Chapter 2 General Provisions Concerning Offenses \u00a7 201. General purposes. The general purposes of this Criminal Code are: (1) To proscribe conduct which unjustifiably and inexcusably causes or threatens harm to individual or public interests; (2) To give fair warning of the nature of the conduct proscribed and of the sentences authorized upon conviction; (3) To define the act or omission and the accompanying mental state which constitute each offense; (4) To differentiate upon reasonable grounds between serious and minor offenses and to prescribe proportionate penalties therefor; and (5) To insure the public safety by preventing the commission of offenses through the deterrent influence of the sentences authorized, the rehabilitation of those convicted and their confinement when required in the interests of public protection. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 201; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 202. All offenses defined by statute. (a) No conduct constitutes a criminal offense unless it is made a criminal offense by this Criminal Code or by another law. (b) This section does not affect the power of a court to punish for civil contempt or to employ any sanction authorized by law for the enforcement of an order or a civil judgment or decree. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 202; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 203. Principles of construction. The general rule that a penal statute is to be strictly construed does not apply to this Criminal Code, but the provisions herein must be construed according to the fair import of their terms to promote justice and effect the purposes of the law, as stated in \u00a7 201 of this title. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 203; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 204. Territorial applicability. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section a person may be convicted under the law of this State of an offense committed by the person's own conduct or by the conduct of another for which the person is legally accountable if: (1) Either the conduct or the result which is an element of the offense occurs within Delaware; or (2) Conduct occurring outside the State is sufficient under Delaware law to constitute a conspiracy to commit an offense within the State and an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy occurs within the State; or (3) Conduct occurring within the State establishes complicity in the commission of, or an attempt, solicitation or conspiracy to commit, an offense in another jurisdiction which also is an offense under the law of Delaware; or (4) The offense consists of the omission to perform a legal duty imposed by Delaware law with respect to domicile, residence or a relationship to a person, thing or transaction in the State; or (5) The offense is based on a statute of Delaware which expressly prohibits conduct outside the State, when the conduct bears a reasonable relation to a legitimate interest of this State and the defendant knows or should know that the defendant's conduct is likely to affect that interest. (b) Paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply when causing a particular result is an element of an offense and the result is caused by conduct occurring outside Delaware which would not constitute an offense if the result had occurred in the same place, unless the defendant intentionally, knowingly or recklessly caused the result within Delaware. (c) When the offense is homicide, either the death of the victim or the bodily impact causing death constitutes a \"result\" within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section and if the body of a homicide victim is found within this State it is presumed that the result occurred within the State. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 204; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 205. Time limitations. (a) A prosecution for murder or any class A felony, or any attempt to commit said crimes, may be commenced at any time. (b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, prosecutions for other offenses are subject to the following periods of limitation: (1) A prosecution for any felony except murder or any class A felony, or any attempt to commit said crimes, must be commenced within 5 years after it is committed; (2) A prosecution for a class A misdemeanor must be commenced within 3 years after it is committed;Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 3(3) A prosecution for a class B misdemeanor, a class C misdemeanor, an unclassified misdemeanor or a violation must be commenced within 2 years after it is committed. (c) If the period prescribed by subsection (b) of this section has expired, a prosecution for any offense in which the accused's acts include or constitute forgery, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty or actively concealed theft or misapplication of property by an employee, pledgee, bailee or fiduciary may be commenced within 2 years after discovery of the offense has been made or should have been made in the exercise of ordinary diligence by an aggrieved party or by an authorized agent, fiduciary, guardian, personal representative or parent (in the case of an infant) of an aggrieved party who is not a party to the offense. In no case shall this provision extend the period of limitation otherwise applicable by more than an additional 3 years beyond the period specified in subsection (b) of this section. (d) If the period prescribed by subsection (b) of this section has expired, a prosecution for any offense based upon misconduct in office by a public officer or employee may be commenced at any time when the defendant is in public office or employment or within 2 years thereafter. In no case shall this provision extend the period of limitation otherwise applicable by more than an additional 3 years beyond the period specified in subsection (b) of this section. (e) Notwithstanding the period prescribed by subsection (b) of this section, a prosecution for any crime that is delineated in \u00a7 787 of this title and in which the victim is a minor, subpart D of subchapter II of Chapter 5 of this title, or is otherwise defined as a \"sexual offense\" by \u00a7 761 of this title except \u00a7 763, \u00a7 764 or \u00a7 765 of this title, or any attempt to commit said crimes, may be commenced at any time. No prosecution under this subsection shall be based upon the memory of the victim that has been recovered through psychotherapy unless there is some evidence of the corpus delicti independent of such repressed memory. This subsection applies to all causes of action arising before, on or after July 15, 1992, and to the extent consistent with this subsection, it shall revive causes of action that would otherwise be barred by this section. (f) An offense is committed either when every element occurs, or, if a legislative purpose to prohibit a continuing course of conduct plainly appears, at the time when the course of conduct or the defendant's complicity therein is terminated. Time starts to run on the day after the offense is committed. (g) For purposes of this section, a prosecution is commenced when either an indictment is found or an information is filed. (h) The period of limitation does not run: (1) During any time when the accused is fleeing or hiding from justice so that the accused's identity or whereabouts within or outside the State cannot be ascertained, despite a diligent search for the accused; or (2) During any time when the accused in a prosecution has become a fugitive from justice by failing to appear for any scheduled court proceeding related to such prosecution for which proper notice under the law was provided or attempted. It is no defense to a prosecution under this paragraph that the person did not receive notice of the scheduled court proceeding. (3) During any time when a prosecution, including a prosecution under a defective indictment or information, against the accused for the same conduct has been commenced and is pending in this State. (i) If the period prescribed by subsection (b) of this section has expired, a prosecution for any offense in this title may be commenced within 10 years after it is committed if based upon forensic DNA testing. (j) In any prosecution in which subsection (c), (d), (e), (h) or (i) of this section is sought to be invoked to avoid the limitation period of subsection (b) of this section, the State must allege and prove the applicability of subsection (c), (d), (e), (h) or (i) as an element of the offense. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 205; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 60 Del. Laws, c. 401, \u00a7 1; 68 Del. Laws, c. 397, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2; 70 Del. Laws, c. 92, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 71 Del. Laws, c. 264, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2; 72 Del. Laws, c. 320, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2; 74 Del. Laws, c. 56, \u00a7 1; 75 Del. Laws, c. 367, \u00a7 1; 79 Del. Laws, c. 276, \u00a7 4.) \u00a7 206. Method of prosecution when conduct constitutes more than 1 offense. (a) When the same conduct of a defendant may establish the commission of more than 1 offense, the defendant may be prosecuted for each offense. The defendant's liability for more than 1 offense may be considered by the jury whenever the State's case against the defendant for each offense is established in accordance with \u00a7 301 of this title. The defendant may not, however, be convicted of more than 1 offense if: (1) One offense is included in the other, as defined in subsection (b) of this section; or (2) One offense consists only of an attempt to commit the other; or (3) Inconsistent findings of fact are required to establish the commission of the offenses. (b) A defendant may be convicted of an offense included in an offense charged in the indictment or information. An offense is so included when: (1) It is established by the proof of the same or less than all the facts required to establish the commission of the offense charged; or (2) It consists of an attempt to commit the offense charged or to commit an offense otherwise included therein; or (3) It involves the same result but differs from the offense charged only in the respect that a less serious injury or risk of injury to the same person, property or public interest or a lesser kind of culpability suffices to establish its commission.Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 4(c) The court is not obligated to charge the jury with respect to an included offense unless there is a rational basis in the evidence for a verdict acquitting the defendant of the offense charged and convicting the defendant of the included offense. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 206; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 207. When prosecution is barred by former prosecution for the same offense. When a prosecution is for a violation of the same statutory provisions and is based upon the same facts as a former prosecution, it is barred by the former prosecution under the following circumstances: (1) The former prosecution resulted in an acquittal which has not subsequently been set aside. There is an acquittal if the prosecution resulted in a finding of not guilty by the trier of fact or in a determination by the court that there was insufficient evidence to warrant a conviction. A finding of guilty of a lesser included offense is an acquittal of the greater inclusive offense, although the conviction is subsequently set aside. (2) The former prosecution was terminated, after the information had been filed or the indictment found, by a final order or judgment for the defendant, which has not been set aside, reversed or vacated and which necessarily required a determination inconsistent with a fact or a legal proposition that must be established for conviction of the offense. (3) The former prosecution resulted in a conviction. There is a conviction if the prosecution resulted in a judgment of conviction which has not been reversed or vacated, a verdict of guilty which has not been set aside and which is capable of supporting a judgment or a plea of guilty or nolo contendere accepted by the court. (4) The former prosecution was improperly terminated. Except as provided in this subdivision there is an improper termination of a prosecution if the termination is for reasons not amounting to an acquittal, and it takes place after the first witness is sworn but before verdict. Termination under any of the following circumstances is not improper: a. The defendant consents to the termination or waives, by motion to dismiss or otherwise, the right to object to the termination. b. The trial court declares a mistrial in accordance with law. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 207; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 208. When prosecution is barred by former prosecution for different offense. Although a prosecution is for a violation of a different statutory provision or is based on different facts, it is barred by a former prosecution in a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter of the second prosecution under the following circumstances: (1) The former prosecution resulted in an acquittal which has not subsequently been set aside or in a conviction as defined in \u00a7 207 of this title and the subsequent prosecution is for: a. Any offense of which the defendant could have been convicted on the first prosecution; or b. The same conduct, unless: 1. The offense for which the defendant is subsequently prosecuted requires proof of a fact not required by the former offense and the law defining each of the offenses is intended to prevent a substantially different harm or evil; or 2. The second offense was not consummated when the former trial began. (2) The former prosecution was terminated by an acquittal or by a final order or judgment for the defendant which has not been set aside, reversed or vacated and which acquittal, final order or judgment necessarily required a determination inconsistent with a fact which must be established for conviction of the second offense. (3) The former prosecution was improperly terminated as improper termination is defined in \u00a7 207(4) of this title and the subsequent prosecution is for an offense of which the defendant could have been convicted had the former prosecution not been improperly terminated. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 208; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 209. Former prosecution in another jurisdiction; when a bar. When conduct constitutes an offense within the concurrent jurisdiction of this State and of the United States or another state, a prosecution in any such other jurisdiction is a bar to a subsequent prosecution in this State under the following circumstances: (1) The first prosecution resulted in an acquittal which has not subsequently been set aside or in a conviction as defined in \u00a7 207 of this title and the subsequent prosecution is based on the same conduct, unless: a. The offense for which the defendant is subsequently prosecuted requires proof of a fact not required by the former offense and the law defining each of the offenses is intended to prevent a substantially different harm or evil; or b. The second offense was not consummated when the former trial began; or (2) The former prosecution was terminated, after the information was filed or the indictment found, by an acquittal or by a final order or judgment for the defendant which has not been set aside, reversed or vacated and which acquittal, final order or judgment necessarily required a determination inconsistent with a fact which must be established for conviction of the offense for which the defendant is subsequently prosecuted; orTitle 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 5(3) The former prosecution was improperly terminated as improper termination is defined in \u00a7 207(4) of this title and the subsequent prosecution is for an offense of which the defendant could have been convicted had the former prosecution not been improperly terminated. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 209; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 210. Former prosecution before court lacking jurisdiction or when fraudulently procured by defendant. A prosecution is not a bar within the meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 207, 208 and 209 of this title under any of the following circumstances: (1) The former prosecution was before a court which lacked jurisdiction over the defendant or the offense; or (2) The former prosecution was procured by the defendant without the knowledge of the appropriate prosecuting officer and with the purpose of avoiding the sentence which might otherwise be imposed; or (3) The former prosecution resulted in a judgment of conviction which was held invalid on appeal or in a subsequent proceeding on a writ of habeas corpus, coram nobis or similar process. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 210; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 211. Repeal of statutes as affecting existing liabilities. (a) The repeal of any statute creating, defining or relating to any criminal offense set forth under the laws of this State, shall not have the effect of releasing or extinguishing any penalty, forfeiture or liability incurred under such statute, unless the repealing act shall so expressly provide, and such statute shall be treated as remaining in full force and effect for the purpose of sustaining any proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of such penalty, forfeiture or liability. (b) Any action, case, prosecution, trial or other legal proceeding in progress under or pursuant to any statute relating to any criminal offense set forth under the laws of this State shall be preserved and shall not become illegal or terminated in the event that such statute is later amended by the General Assembly, irrespective of the stage of such proceeding, unless the amending act expressly provides to the contrary. For the purposes of such proceedings, the prior law shall remain in full force and effect. (71 Del. Laws, c. 263, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7\u00a7 212-220. [Reserved.] \u00a7 221. Principles of definitions.

Laws, c. 149, \u00a7 2.) \u00a7 223. Words of gender or number. Unless the context otherwise requires, words denoting the singular number may, and where necessary shall, be construed as denoting the plural number, and words denoting the plural number may, and where necessary shall, be construed as denoting the singular number, and words denoting the masculine gender may, and where necessary shall, be construed as denoting the feminine gender or the neuter gender. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 223; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 224. Valuation of property. Whenever the value of property is determinative of the degree of an accused's criminal guilt or otherwise relevant in a criminal prosecution, it shall be ascertained as follows: (1) Except as otherwise specified in this section, \"value\" means the market value of the property at the time and place of the crime, or if that cannot be satisfactorily ascertained, the cost of replacing the property within a reasonable time after the crime. (2) Whether or not they have been issued or delivered, the value of certain written instruments, not including those having a readily ascertainable market value, shall be ascertained as follows: a. The value of an instrument constituting an evidence of debt, such as a check, draft or promissory note, shall be deemed the amount due or collectible thereon or thereby, that figure ordinarily being the face amount of the indebtedness less any portion thereof which has been satisfied. b. The value of any other instrument which creates, releases, discharges or otherwise affects any valuable legal right, privilege or obligation shall be deemed the greatest amount of economic loss which the owner of the instrument might reasonably suffer by virtue of the loss of the instrument. (3) When the value of property cannot satisfactorily be ascertained pursuant to the standards set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this section, its value shall be deemed to be an amount less than $100. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 224; 58 497, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7\u00a7 225-230. [Reserved.] \u00a7 231. Definitions relating to state of mind. (a) \"Criminal negligence\". \u2014 A person acts with criminal negligence with respect to an element of an offense when the person fails to perceive a risk that the element exists or will result from the conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that failure to perceive it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 8(b) \"Intentionally\". \u2014 A person acts intentionally with respect to an element of an offense when: (1) If the element involves the nature of the person's conduct or a result thereof, it is the person's conscious object to engage in conduct of that nature or to cause that result; and (2) If the element involves the attendant circumstances, the person is aware of the existence of such circumstances or believes or hopes that they exist. (c) \"Knowingly\". \u2014 A person acts knowingly with respect to an element of an offense when: (1) If the element involves the nature of the person's conduct or the attendant circumstances, the person is aware that the conduct is of that nature or that such circumstances exist; and (2) If the element involves a result of the person's conduct, the person is aware that it is practically certain that the conduct will cause that result. (d) \"Negligence\". \u2014 A person acts with negligence with respect to an element of an offense when the person fails to exercise the standard of care which a reasonable person would observe in the situation. (e) \"Recklessly\". \u2014 A person acts recklessly with respect to an element of an offense when the person is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the element exists or will result from the conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that disregard thereof constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation. A person who creates such a risk but is unaware thereof solely by reason of voluntary intoxication also acts recklessly with respect thereto. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 231; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 63 Del. Laws, c. 88, \u00a7 6; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 232. Definition relating to elements of offense. \"Elements of an offense\" are those physical acts, attendant circumstances, results and states of mind which are specifically included within the definition of the offense or, if the definition is incomplete, those states of mind which are supplied by the general provisions of this Criminal Code. Facts establishing jurisdiction and venue and establishing that the offense was committed within the time period prescribed in \u00a7 205 of this title must also be proved as elements of the offense. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 232; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 233. Definition and classification of offenses. (a) \"Crime\" or \"offense\" means an act or omission forbidden by a statute of this State and punishable upon conviction by: (1) Imprisonment; or (2) Fine; or (3) Removal from office; or (4) Disqualification to hold any office of trust, honor or profit under the State; or (5) Other penal discipline. (b) An act or omission is forbidden by a statute of this State if a statute makes the act or omission punishable by any form of punishment mentioned in subsection (a) of this section. (c) An offense is either a felony, a misdemeanor or a violation. Any offense not specifically designated by law to be a felony or a violation is a misdemeanor. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 233; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 234. Definition of terms requiring certain sentences. When used for the purpose of describing or requiring a sentence of incarceration imposed pursuant to this title, the terms \"minimum,\" \"mandatory,\" \"minimum mandatory\" and \"mandatory minimum\" shall be construed as being synonymous. (71 Del. Laws, c. 98, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7\u00a7 235-240. [Reserved.] \u00a7 241. Conviction to precede punishment. The punishments prescribed by this Criminal Code or by any other statute of a criminal nature may be inflicted only after a judgment of conviction by a court having jurisdiction over the person of the defendant and over the subject matter. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 241; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 242. Requirements for criminal liability in general. A person is not guilty of an offense unless liability is based on conduct which includes a voluntary act or the omission to perform an act which the person is physically capable of performing. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 242; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.)Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 9\u00a7 243. Definition of \"voluntary act.\" \"Voluntary act\" means a bodily movement performed consciously or habitually as a result of effort or determination, and includes possession if the defendant knowingly procured or received the thing possessed or was aware of the defendant's control thereof for a sufficient period to have been able to terminate possession. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 243; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7\u00a7 244-250. [Reserved.] \u00a7 251. Proof of state of mind required unless otherwise provided; strict liability. (a) No person may be found guilty of a criminal offense without proof that the person had the state of mind required by the law defining the offense or by subsection (b) of this section. (b) When the state of mind sufficient to establish an element of an offense is not prescribed by law, that element is established if a person acts intentionally, knowingly or recklessly. (c) It is unnecessary to prove the defendant's state of mind with regard to: (1) Offenses which constitute violations, unless a particular state of mind is included within the definition of the offenses; or (2) Offenses defined by statutes other than this Criminal Code, insofar as a legislative purpose to impose strict liability for such offenses or with respect to any material element thereof plainly appears. In all cases covered by this subsection, it is nevertheless necessary to prove that the act or omission on which liability is based was voluntary as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 242 and 243 of this title. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 251; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 252. Prescribed state-of-mind requirement applies to all material elements. When a statute defining an offense prescribes the state of mind that is sufficient for the commission of the offense, without distinguishing among the elements thereof, the provision shall apply to all the elements of the offense, unless a contrary legislative purpose plainly appears. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 252; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 253. Substitutes for criminal negligence, recklessness and knowledge. Whenever a statute provides that negligence suffices to establish an element of an offense, the element is also established if a person acts intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or with criminal negligence. When a statute provides that criminal negligence suffices to establish an element of an offense, the element also is established if a person acts intentionally, knowingly or recklessly. When recklessness suffices to establish an element of an offense, the element also is established if a person acts intentionally or knowingly. When acting knowingly suffices to establish an element of an offense, the element also is established if a person acts intentionally. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 253; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 76 Del. Laws, c. 101, \u00a7 7.) \u00a7 254. Conditional intention. The fact that a defendant's intention was conditional is immaterial unless the condition negatives the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the statute defining the offense. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 254; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 255. Knowledge of high probability. When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge is established if a person is aware of a high probability of its existence, unless the person actually believes that it does not exist. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 255; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 256-260. [Reserved.] \u00a7 261. Causation. Conduct is the cause of a result when it is an antecedent but for which the result in question would not have occurred. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 261; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 262. Intentional or knowing causation; different result from that expected. The element of intentional or knowing causation is not established if the actual result is outside the intention or the contemplation of the defendant unless: (1) The actual result differs from that intended or contemplated, as the case may be, only in the respect that a different person or different property is injured or affected or that the injury or harm intended or contemplated would have been more serious or more extensive than that caused; orTitle 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 10(2) The actual result involves the same kind of injury or harm as the probable result and is not too remote or accidental in its occurrence to have a bearing on the actor's liability or on the gravity of the offense. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 262; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 263. Reckless or negligent causation; different result from that expected or overlooked. The element of reckless or negligent causation is not established if the actual result is outside the risk of which the defendant is aware or, in the case of negligence, of which the defendant should be aware unless: (1) The actual result differs from the probable result only in the respect that a different person or different property is injured or affected or that the probable injury or harm would have been more serious or more extensive than that caused; or (2) The actual result involves the same kind of injury or harm as the probable result and is not too remote or accidental in its occurrence to have a bearing on the actor's liability or on the gravity of the offense. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 263; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 264. Causation in offenses of strict liability. When causing a particular result is an element of an offense for which strict liability is imposed by law, the element is not established unless the actual result is a probable consequence of the actor's conduct. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 264; 58 c. 497, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7\u00a7 265-270. [Reserved.] \u00a7 271. Liability for the conduct of another \u2014 Generally. A person is guilty of an offense committed by another person when: (1) Acting with the state of mind that is sufficient for commission of the offense, the person causes an innocent or irresponsible person to engage in conduct constituting the offense; or (2) Intending to promote or facilitate the commission of the offense the person: a. Solicits, requests, commands, importunes or otherwise attempts to cause the other person to commit it; or b. Aids, counsels or agrees or attempts to aid the other person in planning or committing it; or c. Having a legal duty to prevent the commission of the offense, fails to make a proper effort to do so; or (3) The person's conduct is expressly declared by this Criminal Code or another statute to establish the person's complicity. Nothing in this section shall apply to any law-enforcement officer or the officer's agent while acting in the lawful performance of duty. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 271; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 272. Liability for the conduct of another \u2014 No defense. In any prosecution for an offense in which the criminal liability of the accused is based upon the conduct of another person pursuant to \u00a7 271 of this title, it is no defense that: (1) The other person is not guilty of the offense in question because of irresponsibility or other legal incapacity or exemption, or because of unawareness of the criminal nature of the conduct in question or of the accused's criminal purpose, or because of other factors precluding the mental state required for the commission of the offense; or (2) The other person has not been prosecuted for or convicted of any offense based on the conduct in question, or has previously been acquitted thereof, or has been convicted of a different offense or in a different degree, or has legal immunity from prosecution for the conduct in question; or (3) The offense in question, as defined, can be committed only by a particular class of persons, and the defendant, not belonging to that class, is for that reason legally incapable of committing the offense in an individual capacity, unless imposing liability on the defendant is inconsistent with the purpose of the provision establishing the defendant's incapacity. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 272; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 273. Liability for the conduct of another \u2014 Exemption. Unless otherwise provided by this Criminal Code or by the statute defining the offense, a person is not liable for an offense committed by another person if: (1) The person is a victim of that offense; or (2) The offense is so defined that the person's conduct is inevitably incident to its commission; or (3) The person terminates complicity prior to commission of the offense and: a. Wholly deprives it of effectiveness in the commission of the offense; or b. Gives timely warning to the Attorney General or the police or otherwise makes a proper effort to prevent the commission of the offense.Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 11If the actor's conduct constitutes a separate offense, the actor is liable for that offense only and not for the conduct or offense committed by the other person. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 273; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 274. Offenses involving 2 or more persons; convictions for different degrees of offense. When, pursuant to \u00a7 271 of this title, 2 or more persons are criminally liable for an offense which is divided into degrees, each person is guilty of an offense of such degree as is compatible with that person's own culpable mental state and with that person's own accountability for an aggravating fact or circumstance. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 274; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 275. Indictment as principal and conviction as accomplice; indictment as accomplice and conviction as principal. (a) A person indicted for committing an offense may be convicted as an accomplice to another person guilty of committing the offense. (b) A person indicted as an accomplice to an offense committed by another person may be convicted as a principal. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 275; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7\u00a7 276-280. [Reserved.] \u00a7 281. Criminal liability of organizations. An organization is guilty of an offense when: (1) The conduct constituting the offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty of affirmative performance imposed on organizations by law; or (2) The conduct constituting the offense is engaged in, authorized, solicited, requested, commanded or recklessly tolerated by the board of directors or by a high managerial agent acting within the scope of employment and in behalf of the organization; or (3) The conduct constituting the offense is engaged in by an agent of the organization while acting within the scope of employment and in behalf of the organization and: a. The offense is a misdemeanor or a violation; or b. The offense is one defined by a statute which clearly indicates a legislative intent to impose such criminal liability on an organization. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 281; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 74 Del. Laws, c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2.) \u00a7 282. Criminal liability of an individual for organizational conduct. A person is criminally liable for conduct constituting an offense which the person performs or causes to be performed in the name of or in behalf of an organization to the same extent as if the conduct were performed in the person's own name or behalf. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 282; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 74 Del. Laws, c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3.) \u00a7 283. Impermissible organizational activity no defense. In any prosecution for an offense alleged to have been committed by an organization, it is no defense that the act charged to constitute the offense was an impermissible organizational activity. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 283; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 74 Del. Laws, c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3.) \u00a7 284. Definitions relating to organizational liability. (a) \"Agent\" means any director, officer or employee of an organization, or any other person who is authorized to act in behalf of the organization. (b) \"High managerial agent\" means an officer of an organization or any other agent in a position of comparable authority with respect to the formulation of organizational policy or the supervision in a managerial capacity of subordinate employees. (c) \"Organization\" means any entity listed in the definition of \"person\" contained in \u00a7 222 of this title, other than an individual human being. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 284; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 74 Del. Laws, c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, 5.)Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 12Part I Delaware Criminal Code Chapter 3 Proving and Disproving Criminal Guilt \u00a7 301. State's prima facie case; proof beyond reasonable doubt. (a) In any prosecution for an offense, a prima facie case for the State consists of some credible evidence tending to prove the existence of each element of the offense. (b) No person may be convicted of an offense unless each element of the offense is proved beyond a reasonable doubt. (c) In any prosecution for any compound crime, including but not limited to first degree murder under \u00a7 636(a)(2) or (a)(6) of this title or for second degree murder under \u00a7 635(2) of this title, the corpus delicti of the underlying felony need not be proved independently of a defendant's extrajudicial statement. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 301; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 463, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 302. Jury instruction for defendant on reasonable doubt. (a) Pursuant to \u00a7 301(b) of this title, the defendant is entitled to a jury instruction that the jury must acquit if they fail to find each element of the offense proved beyond a reasonable doubt. (b) The defendant may produce whatever evidence the defendant has tending to negate the existence of any element of the offense, and, if the court finds that a reasonable juror might believe that evidence, the defendant is entitled to a jury instruction that the jury must consider whether the evidence raises a reasonable doubt as to the defendant's guilt. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 302; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 303. Credible evidence to support defenses. (a) No defense defined by this Criminal Code or by another statute may be considered by the jury unless the court is satisfied that some credible evidence supporting the defense has been presented. (b) Evidence supports a defense when it tends to establish the existence of each element of the defense. (c) If some credible evidence supporting a defense is presented, the defendant is entitled to a jury instruction that the jury must acquit the defendant if they find that the evidence raises a reasonable doubt as to the defendant's guilt. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 303; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 59 Del. Laws, c. 547, \u00a7 1; Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 304. Defendant's affirmative defenses; prove by preponderance of evidence. (a) When a defense declared by this Criminal Code or by another statute to be an affirmative defense is raised at trial, the defendant has the burden of establishing it by a preponderance of the evidence. (b) Unless the court determines that no reasonable juror could find an affirmative defense established by a preponderance of the evidence presented by the defendant, the defendant is entitled to a jury instruction that the jury must acquit the defendant if they find the affirmative defense established by a preponderance of the evidence. (c) An affirmative defense is established by a preponderance of the evidence when the jury is persuaded that the evidence makes it more likely than not that each element of the affirmative defense existed at the required time. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 304; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 305. Exemption from criminal liability; affirmative defense to be proved by defendant. When this Criminal Code or another statute specifically exempts a person or activity from the scope of its application and the defendant contends that the defendant is legally entitled to be exempted thereby, the burden is on the defendant to prove, as an affirmative defense, facts necessary to bring the defendant within the exemption. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 305; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 306. No conclusive presumptions; rebuttable presumptions and proof thereof. (a) There are no conclusive presumptions in this Criminal Code, and all conclusive presumptions formerly existing in the criminal law of this State are hereby abolished. (b) Rebuttable presumptions formerly existing in the criminal law of this State are preserved except to the extent that they are inconsistent with this Criminal Code. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Criminal Code, the following rebuttable presumptions are expressly preserved: (1) A person is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of the person's act.Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 13(2) A person found in possession of goods acquired as a result of the commission of a recent crime is presumed to have committed the crime. (d) Proof of a fact tending to create a rebuttable presumption not inconsistent with this Criminal Code or a presumption created by this Criminal Code constitutes prima facie evidence of the presumed conclusion. (e) The court may tell the jury of the existence of the presumption, and if it does so the defendant is entitled to a jury instruction that the presumption does not relieve the State of its burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Nevertheless, the jury may convict the defendant, despite the existence of evidence tending to rebut the presumption, if they find no reasonable doubt about the defendant's guilt. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 306; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 59 Del. Laws, c. 203, \u00a7 2; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 307. Jury inference of defendant's intention, recklessness, knowledge or belief. (a) The defendant's intention, recklessness, knowledge or belief at the time of the offense for which the defendant is charged may be inferred by the jury from the circumstances surrounding the act the defendant is alleged to have done. In making the inference permitted by this section, the jury may consider whether a reasonable person in the defendant's circumstances at the time of the offense would have had or lacked the requisite intention, recklessness, knowledge or belief. (b) When the defendant's intention, recklessness, knowledge or belief is an element of an offense, it is sufficient to establish a prima facie case for the State to prove circumstances surrounding the act which the defendant is alleged to have done from which a reasonable juror might infer that the defendant's intention, recklessness, knowledge or belief was of the sort required for commission of the offense. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 307; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 308. Construction of provisions allowing no defense. When a provision of this Criminal Code expressly denies the applications of a specific defense, no inference is thereby created that any other defense is valid. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 308; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1.)Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 14Part I Delaware Criminal Code Chapter 4 Defenses to Criminal Liability \u00a7 401. Mental illness or psychiatric disorder. (a) In any prosecution for an offense, it is an affirmative defense that, at the time of the conduct charged, as a result of mental illness or serious mental disorder, the accused lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of the accused's conduct. If the defendant prevails in establishing the affirmative defense provided in this subsection, the trier of fact shall return a verdict of \"not guilty by reason of insanity.\" (b) Where the trier of fact determines that, at the time of the conduct charged, a defendant suffered from a mental illness or serious mental disorder which substantially disturbed such person's thinking, feeling or behavior and/or that such mental illness or serious mental disorder left such person with insufficient willpower to choose whether the person would do the act or refrain from doing it, although physically capable, the trier of fact shall return a verdict of \"guilty, but mentally ill.\" (c) It shall not be a defense under this section if the alleged insanity or mental illness was proximately caused by the voluntary ingestion, inhalation or injection of intoxicating liquor, any drug or other mentally debilitating substance, or any combination thereof, unless such substance was prescribed for the defendant by a licensed health-care practitioner and was used in accordance with the directions of such prescription. As used in this chapter, the terms \"insanity\" or \"mental illness\" do not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or other antisocial conduct. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 401; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 63 Del. Laws, c. 328, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 76 Del. Laws, c. 141, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2; 78 Del. Laws, c. 224, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3.) \u00a7 402. Rules to prescribe procedures for psychiatric examination; testimony of psychiatrist or other expert. (a) The procedures for examination of the accused by the accused's own psychiatrist or by a psychiatrist employed by the State and the circumstances under which such an examination will be permitted may be prescribed by rules of the court having jurisdiction over the offense. (b) A psychiatrist or other expert testifying at trial concerning the mental condition of the accused shall be permitted to make a statement as to the nature of the examination, the psychiatrist's or expert's diagnosis of the mental condition of the accused at the time of the commission of the offense charged and the psychiatrist's or expert's opinion as to the extent, if any, to which the capacity of the accused to appreciate the wrongfulness of the accused's conduct or to choose whether the accused would do the act or refrain from doing it or to have a particular state of mind which is an element of the offense charged was impaired as a result of mental illness or serious mental disorder at that time. The psychiatrist or expert shall be permitted to make any explanation reasonably serving to clarify the diagnosis and opinion and may be cross-examined as to any matter bearing on the psychiatrist's or expert's competence or credibility or the validity of the diagnosis or opinion. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 402; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 78 Del. Laws, c. 224, \u00a7 4.) \u00a7 403. Verdict of \"not guilty by reason of insanity;\" commitment to Delaware Psychiatric Center of persons no longer endangering the public safety; periodic review of commitments to Delaware Psychiatric Center; participation of patient in treatment program. (a) Upon the rendition of a verdict of \"not guilty by reason of insanity,\" the court shall, upon motion of the Attorney General, order that the person so acquitted shall forthwith be committed to the Delaware Psychiatric Center. (b) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section below, a person committed, confined or transferred to the Delaware Psychiatric Center in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, \u00a7 404, \u00a7 405, \u00a7 406 or \u00a7 408 of this title (referred to herein as \"the patient\") shall be kept there at all times in a secured building until the Superior Court of the county wherein the case would be tried or was tried is satisfied that the public safety will not be endangered by the patient's release. The Superior Court shall without special motion reconsider the necessity of continued detention of a patient thus committed after the patient has been detained for 1 year. The Court shall thereafter reconsider the patient's detention upon petition on the patient's behalf or whenever advised by the Psychiatric Center that the public safety will not be endangered by the patient's release. (c) (1) Upon petition by a patient confined pursuant to this section, \u00a7 404, \u00a7 405, \u00a7 406 or \u00a7 408 of this title, or upon petition by the Center Director of the Delaware Psychiatric Center, the Court may permit housing in an unsecured building or participation by the patient in any treatment program that is offered by the Center, which requires or provides that the patient be placed outside a secured building. Such participation shall include, but not be limited to, employment off hospital grounds, job interviews, family visits and other activities inside and outside the Center, as may be prescribed by the Medical Director in the interest of rehabilitation. (2) The petition shall include an affidavit from the Medical Director which states that the patient has not exhibited dangerous behavior during the last year of confinement and that in the opinion of the Medical Director, the patient will benefit from such participation.Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 15(3) The petition shall set forth any specific treatment program being sought; the specific goals and course of treatment involved; and a schedule for periodic judicial reevaluation of the patient's treatment status, all of which shall be subject to the Court's approval and modification. (4) Copies of the petition shall be served on the Attorney General, the Medical Director and the patient or the patient's counsel or guardian. (5) There shall be a judicial hearing on the petition, and any person or agency served with a copy of the petition, or a representative of such person or agency, shall have the right to testify, present evidence and/or cross-examine witnesses. The patient shall have the right to be represented by counsel at any proceeding held in accordance with this section. The Court shall appoint counsel for the patient if the patient cannot afford to retain counsel. (6) Upon conclusion of a hearing on a petition pursuant to this section, the Court may approve, modify or disapprove any request or matter within the petition. If the patient's participation in any treatment program is approved, such approval or participation shall be effective for not longer than 6 months from the date of the judge's signature on the petition or order permitting such participation. Immediately prior to the conclusion of the 6-month period, the Center Director shall report to the Court on the patient's status, and make recommendations. Any authorization by the Court for continued participation by the patient in any authorized treatment programs may be extended, modified or discontinued at the end of the effective period with or without further hearings, as the Court may determine. (d) Any treatment program approved by the Court under this section may be terminated by the Medical Director of the Delaware Psychiatric Center. When a treatment program is terminated earlier than its court-approved expiration date, the Medical Director shall immediately notify the Superior Court. The Superior Court shall, after giving appropriate notice, hear the matter and review the decision of the Medical Director. At such termination hearing, the patient shall have such rights as are provided for other hearings under this section, including the right to counsel, the right to present evidence and the right to cross-examine witnesses. Where the Medical Director's decision to terminate is based upon the patient's mental or psychological condition, the patient may be examined by an independent psychiatrist or other qualified expert; provided, however, that the termination hearing shall not be held until such examination has been finally concluded. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 403; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 63 Del. Laws, c. 428, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3; 65 Del. Laws, c. 90, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 550, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 404. Confinement in Delaware Psychiatric Center of persons too mentally ill to stand trial; requiring State to prove prima facie case in such circumstances; adjustment of sentences. (a) Whenever the court is satisfied, after hearing, that an accused person, because of mental illness or serious mental disorder, is unable to understand the nature of the proceedings against the accused, or to give evidence in the accused's own defense or to instruct counsel on the accused's own behalf, the court may order the accused person to be confined and treated in the Delaware Psychiatric Center until the accused person is capable of standing trial. However, upon motion of the defendant, the court may conduct a hearing to determine whether the State can make out a prima facie case against the defendant, and if the State fails to present sufficient evidence to constitute a prima facie case, the court shall dismiss the charge. This dismissal shall have the same effect as a judgment of acquittal. (b) When the court finds that the defendant is capable of standing trial, the defendant may be tried in the ordinary way, but the court may make any adjustment in the sentence which is required in the interest of justice, including a remission of all or any part of the time spent in the Psychiatric Center. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 404; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 59 Del. Laws, c. 203, \u00a7 3; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 550, \u00a7 1; 78 Del. Laws, c. 224, \u00a7 5.) \u00a7 405. Confinement in Delaware Psychiatric Center of persons developing mental illness after conviction but before sentencing; adjustment of sentences. (a) Whenever the court is satisfied that a prisoner has developed a mental illness after conviction but before sentencing so that the prisoner is unable understandingly to participate in the sentencing proceedings, and if the court is satisfied that a sentence of imprisonment may be appropriate, the court may order the prisoner to be confined and treated in the Delaware Psychiatric Center until the prisoner is capable of participating in the sentencing proceedings. (b) When the court finds that the prisoner is capable of participating in the sentencing proceedings, the prisoner may be sentenced in the ordinary way, but the court may make any adjustment in the sentence which is required in the interest of justice, including a remission of all or any part of the time spent in the Psychiatric Center. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 405; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 550, \u00a7 1; 78 Del. Laws, c. 224, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7.) \u00a7 406. Transfer of convicted persons becoming mentally disabled from prison to Delaware Psychiatric Center; appointment of physicians to conduct inquiry; expenses of transfer. (a) Whenever in any case it appears to the Superior Court, upon information received from the Department of Health and Social Services, that a prisoner confined with the Department has developed a mental illness after conviction and sentence, the Court may appointTitle 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 162 reputable practicing physicians to inquire of the mental condition of the prisoner and make report of their finding to the Court within 2 days from the date of their appointment, by writing under their hands and seals. Should the report of the physicians be that the prisoner has a mental illness, the prisoner shall at once be ordered by the Court transferred from the prison facility where the prisoner is confined to the Delaware Psychiatric Center. (b) The expenses of the removal of such a person with a mental illness and of admission into such Psychiatric Center and maintenance therein up and until the time the person is discharged by the Court shall be borne by the State. If any such person with a mental illness has any real or personal estate, the Department of Health and Social Services shall have for the expenses and charges so incurred the same remedy as is provided in \u00a7 5019 of Title 16. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 406; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 550, \u00a7 1; 78 Del. Laws, c. 224, \u00a7 8; 79 Del. Laws, c. 442, \u00a7 2; 81 Laws, c. 79, \u00a7 8.) \u00a7 407. [Reserved.] \u00a7 408. Verdict of \"guilty, but mentally ill\" \u2014 Sentence; confinement; discharge from treating facility. (a) Where a defendant's defense is based upon allegations which, if true, would be grounds for a verdict of \"guilty, but mentally ill\" or the defendant desires to enter a plea to that effect, no finding of \"guilty, but mentally ill\" shall be rendered until the trier of fact has examined all appropriate reports (including the presentence investigation); has held a hearing on the sole issue of the defendant's mental illness, at which either party may present evidence; and is satisfied that the defendant did in fact have a mental illness at the time of the offense to which the plea is entered. Where the trier of fact, after such hearing, is not satisfied that the defendant had a mental illness at the time of the offense, or determines that the facts do not support a \"guilty, but mentally ill\" plea, the trier of fact shall strike such plea, or permit such plea to be withdrawn by the defendant. A defendant whose plea is not accepted by the trier of fact shall be entitled to a jury trial, except that if a defendant subsequently waives the right to a jury trial, the judge who presided at the hearing on mental illness shall not preside at the trial. (b) In a trial under this section a defendant found guilty but mentally ill, or whose plea to that effect is accepted, may have any sentence imposed which may lawfully be imposed upon any defendant for the same offense. Such defendant shall be committed into the custody of the Department of Correction, and shall undergo such further evaluation and be given such immediate and temporary treatment as is psychiatrically indicated. The Commissioner shall retain exclusive jurisdiction over such person in all matters relating to security. The Commissioner shall thereupon confine such person in the Delaware Psychiatric Center, or other suitable place for the residential treatment of criminally culpable persons with a mental illness under the age of 18 who have been found nonamenable to the processes of Family Court. Although such person shall remain under the jurisdiction of the Department of Correction, decisions directly related to treatment for the mental illness for individuals placed at the Delaware Psychiatric Center, shall be the joint responsibility of the Director of the Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health and those persons at the Delaware Psychiatric Center who are directly responsible for such treatment. The Delaware Psychiatric Center, or any other residential treatment facility to which the defendant is committed by the Commissioner, shall have the authority to discharge the defendant from the facility and return the defendant to the physical custody of the Commissioner whenever the facility believes that such a discharge is in the best interests of the defendant. The offender may, by written statement, refuse to take any drugs which are prescribed for treatment of the offender's mental illness; except when such a refusal will endanger the life of the offender, or the lives or property of other persons with whom the offender has contact. (c) When the Psychiatric Center or other treating facility designated by the Commissioner discharges an offender prior to the expiration of such person's sentence, the treating facility shall transmit to the Commissioner and to the Parole Board a report on the condition of the offender which contains the clinical facts; the diagnosis; the course of treatment, and prognosis for the remission of symptoms; the potential for the recidivism, and for danger to the offender's own person or the public; and recommendations for future treatment. Where an offender under this section is sentenced to the Psychiatric Center or other facility, the offender shall not be eligible for any privileges not permitted in writing by the Commissioner (including escorted or unescorted on-grounds or off-grounds privileges) until the offender has become eligible for parole. Where the court finds that the offender, before completing the sentence, no longer needs nor could benefit from treatment for the offender's mental illness, the offender shall be remanded to the Department of Correction. The offender shall have credited toward the sentence the time served at the Psychiatric Center or other facility. (d) No individual under the age of 18 shall be placed at the Delaware Psychiatric Center. Nothing herein shall prevent either the transfer to or placement at the Delaware Psychiatric Center any person who has reached the age of 18 following any finding of guilty, but mentally ill. (63 Del. Laws, c. 328, \u00a7 2; 64 Del. Laws, c. 467, \u00a7 8; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 550, \u00a7 1; 73 Del. Laws, c. 41, \u00a7 1; 76 Del. Laws, c. 322, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3; 78 Del. Laws, c. 224, \u00a7 9; 79 Del. Laws, c. 371, \u00a7 9.) \u00a7 409. Verdict of \"guilty, but mentally ill\" \u2014 Parole; probation. (a) A person who has been adjudged \"guilty, but mentally ill\" and who during incarceration is discharged from treatment may be placed on prerelease or parole status under the same terms and laws applicable to any other offender. Psychological or psychiatric counseling and treatment may be required as a condition for such status. Failure to continue treatment, except by agreement of the Department of Correction, shall be a basis for terminating prerelease status or instituting parole violation hearings.Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 17(b) If the report of the Delaware Psychiatric Center or other facility recommends parole, the paroling authority shall within 45 days or at the expiration of the offender's minimum sentence, whichever is later, meet to consider the offender's request for parole. If the report does not recommend parole, but other laws or administrative rules of the Department permit parole, the paroling authority may meet to consider a parole request. When the paroling authority considers the offender for parole, it shall consult with the State Hospital or other facility at which the offender had been treated, or from which the offender has been discharged. (c) If an offender who has been found \"guilty, but mentally ill\" is placed on probation, the court, upon recommendation by the Attorney General, shall make treatment a condition of probation. Reports as specified by the trial judge shall be filed with the probation officer, and the sentencing court. Treatment shall be provided by an agency of the State or, with the approval of the sentencing court and at individual expense, private agencies, private physicians or other mental health personnel. (63 Del. Laws, c. 328, \u00a7 2; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 70 c. 550, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7\u00a7 410-420. [Reserved.] \u00a7 421. Voluntary intoxication. The fact that a criminal act was committed while the person committing such act was in a state of intoxication, or was committed because of such intoxication, is no defense to any criminal charge if the intoxication was voluntary. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 421; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 59 Del. Laws, c. 103, \u00a7 1; 59 Del. Laws, c. 203, \u00a7 37; 60 Del. Laws, c. 680, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 422. Intoxication not mental illness. Evidence of voluntary intoxication shall not be admissible for the purpose of proving the existence of mental illness, mental defect, serious mental disorder or psychiatric disorder within the meaning of \u00a7 401 of this title. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 422; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 71 Del. Laws, c. 153, \u00a7 1; 78 Del. Laws, c. 224, \u00a7 10.) \u00a7 423. Involuntary intoxication as a defense. In any prosecution for an offense it is a defense that, as a result of intoxication which is not voluntary, the actor at the time of the conduct lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of the conduct or to perform a material element of the offense, or lacked sufficient willpower to choose whether the person would do the act or refrain from doing it. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 423; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 424. Definitions relating to intoxication. As used in \u00a7\u00a7 421-423 of this title: (1) \"Intoxication\" means the inability, resulting from the introduction of substances into the body, to exercise control over one's mental faculties. (2) \"Voluntary intoxication\" means intoxication caused by substances which the actor knowingly introduces into the actor's body, the tendency of which to cause intoxication the actor knows or should know, unless the actor introduces them pursuant to medical advice or under such duress as would afford a defense to a prosecution for a criminal offense. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 424; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; \u00a7 431. Duress as affirmative defense; defense unavailable in certain situations. (a) In any prosecution for an offense, it is an affirmative defense that the defendant engaged in the conduct charged to constitute the offense because the defendant was coerced to do so by the use of, or a threat to use, force against the defendant's person or the person of another, which a reasonable person in the defendant's situation would have been unable to resist. (b) The defense provided by subsection (a) of this section is unavailable if the defendant intentionally or recklessly placed himself or herself in a situation in which it was probable that the defendant would be subjected to duress. (c) It is not a defense that a woman acted on the command of her husband, unless she acted under such coercion as would establish a defense under this section. The presumption that a woman acting in the presence of her husband is coerced is abolished. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 431; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 432. Entrapment as affirmative defense; defense unavailable in certain situations. (a) In any prosecution for an offense, it is an affirmative defense that the accused engaged in the proscribed conduct because the accused was induced by a law-enforcement official or the law-enforcement official's agent who is acting in the knowing cooperation with such an official to engage in the proscribed conduct constituting such conduct which is a crime when such person is not otherwise disposed to do so. The defense of entrapment as defined by this Criminal Code concedes the commission of the act charged but claims that it should not be punished because of the wrongdoing of the officer originates the idea of the crime and then induces the other person to engage in conduct constituting such a crime when the other person is not otherwise disposed to do so.Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 18(b) The defense afforded by subsection (a) of this section is unavailable when causing or threatening physical injury is an element of the offense charged and the prosecution is based on conduct causing or threatening such injury to a person other than the person perpetrating the entrapment. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 432; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 59 Del. Laws, c. 203, \u00a7 38; Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7\u00a7 433-440. [Reserved.] \u00a7 441. Ignorance or mistake of fact as defense. In any prosecution for an offense, it is a defense that the accused engaged in the conduct charged to constitute the offense under ignorance or mistake of fact if: (1) The ignorance or mistake negatives the state of mind for the commission of the offense; or (2) The statute defining the offense or a statute related thereto expressly provides that the ignorance or mistake constitutes a defense or exemption; or (3) The ignorance or mistake is of a kind that supports a defense of justification as defined in this Criminal Code. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 441; 58 Del. [Reserved.] \u00a7 451. Consent of victim to acts not involving physical injury as defense. In any prosecution for an offense, it is a defense that the victim consented to the act done, provided that: (1) The act did not involve or threaten physical injury; and (2) Such consent negatives an element of the offense. Any person who enters the presence of other people consents to the normal physical contacts incident to such presence. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 451; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 452. Consent of victim to inflictions of physical injury as defense. In any prosecution for an offense involving or threatening physical injury, it is a defense that the victim consented to the infliction of physical injury of the kind done or threatened, provided that: (1) The physical injury done or threatened by the conduct consented to is not serious physical injury; or (2) The physical injury done or threatened is a reasonably foreseeable hazard of joint participation in any concerted activity, athletic contest or sport not prohibited by law. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 452; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 453. Circumstances negativing consent as defense. Unless otherwise provided by this Criminal Code or by the law defining the offense, consent of the victim does not constitute a defense if: (1) It is given by a person who is legally incompetent to authorize the conduct charged to constitute the offense unless the defendant believes the victim is legally competent; or (2) It is given by a person who, because of youth, mental illness, mental condition, mental defect, serious mental disorder, psychiatric disorder or intoxication is manifestly unable or known by the defendant to be unable to make a reasonable judgment as to the nature or harmfulness of the conduct charged to constitute the offense; or (3) It is given by a person whose improvident consent is sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense; or (4) It is induced by force, duress or deception. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 453; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 78 Del. Laws, c. 224, \u00a7 11.) \u00a7 454. Knowledge of victim's age. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, it is no defense for an offense or sentencing provision defined in this title or in Title 16 or 31 which has as an element of such offense or sentencing provision the age of the victim that the accused did not know the age of the victim or reasonably believed the person to be of an age which would not meet the element of such offense or sentencing provision unless the statute defining such offense or sentencing provision or a statute directly related thereto expressly provides that knowledge of the victim's age is an element of the offense or that lack of such knowledge is a defense. (73 Del. Laws, c. 126, \u00a7 2.) \u00a7\u00a7 455-460. [Reserved.] \u00a7 461. Justification \u2014 A defense. In any prosecution for an offense, justification, as defined in \u00a7\u00a7 462-471 of this title, is a defense. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 461; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1.)Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 19\u00a7 462. Justification \u2014 Execution of public duty. (a) Unless inconsistent with the ensuing sections of this Criminal Code defining justifiable use of physical force, or with some other provision of law, conduct which would otherwise constitute an offense is justifiable when it is required or authorized by a provision of law or by a judicial decree, including: (1) Laws defining duties and functions of public officers; (2) Laws defining duties of private citizens to assist public servants in the performance of certain of their functions; (3) Laws governing the execution of legal process; (4) Laws governing the military services and the conduct of war; and (5) Judgments or orders of competent courts or tribunals. (b) The justification afforded by subsection (a) of this section applies when: (1) The defendant's conduct is required or authorized by the judgment or order of a competent court or tribunal or in the lawful execution of legal process, notwithstanding lack of jurisdiction of the court or defect in the legal process; or (2) The defendant believes the conduct to be required or authorized to assist a public officer in the performance of the officer's duties, notwithstanding that the officer exceeded the officer's legal authority. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 462; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 59 Del. Laws, c. 203, \u00a7 4; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 463. Justification \u2014 Choice of evils. Unless inconsistent with the ensuing sections of this Criminal Code defining justifiable use of physical force, or with some other provisions of law, conduct which would otherwise constitute an offense is justifiable when it is necessary as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury which is about to occur by reason of a situation occasioned or developed through no fault of the defendant, and which is of such gravity that, according to ordinary standards of intelligence and morality, the desirability and urgency of avoiding such injury clearly outweigh the desirability of avoiding the injury sought to be prevented by the statute defining the offense in issue. The necessity and justifiability of such conduct may not rest upon considerations pertaining only to the morality and advisability of the statute, either in its general application or with respect to its application to a particular class of cases arising thereunder. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 463; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 464. Justification \u2014 Use of force in self-protection. (a) The use of force upon or toward another person is justifiable when the defendant reasonably believes that such force is immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting the defendant against the use of unlawful force by the other person on the present occasion. (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, a person employing protective force may estimate the necessity thereof under the circumstances as the person reasonably believes them to be when the force is used, without retreating, surrendering possession, doing any other act which the person has no legal duty to do or abstaining from any lawful action. (c) The use of deadly force is justifiable under this section if the defendant reasonably believes that such force is necessary to protect the defendant against death, serious physical injury, kidnapping or sexual intercourse compelled by force or threat. (d) The use of force is not justifiable under this section to resist an arrest which the defendant knows or should know is being made by a peace officer, whether or not the arrest is lawful. (e) The use of deadly force is not justifiable under this section if: (1) The defendant, with the purpose of causing death or serious physical injury, provoked the use of force against the defendant in the same encounter; or (2) The defendant knows that the necessity of using deadly force can be avoided with complete safety by retreating, by surrendering possession of a thing to a person asserting a claim of right thereto or by complying with a demand that the defendant abstain from performing an act which the defendant is not legally obligated to perform except that: a. The defendant is not obliged to retreat in or from the defendant's dwelling; and b. The defendant is not obliged to retreat in or from the defendant's place of work, unless the defendant was the initial aggressor; and c. A public officer justified in using force in the performance of the officer's duties, or a person justified in using force in assisting an officer or a person justified in using force in making an arrest or preventing an escape, need not desist from efforts to perform the duty or make the arrest or prevent the escape because of resistance or threatened resistance by or on behalf of the person against whom the action is directed.

Justification \u2014 Use of force for the protection of other persons. (a) The use of force upon or toward the person of another is justifiable to protect a third person when: (1) The defendant would have been justified under \u00a7 464 of this title in using such force to protect the defendant against the injury the defendant reasonably believes to be threatened to the person whom the defendant seeks to protect; andTitle 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 20(2) Under the circumstances as the defendant reasonably believes them to be, the person whom the defendant seeks to protect would have been justified in using such protective force; and (3) The defendant reasonably believes that intervention is necessary for the protection of the other person. (b) Although the defendant would have been obliged under \u00a7 464 of this title to retreat, to surrender the possession of a thing or to comply with a demand before using force in self-protection, there is no obligation to do so before using force for the protection of another person, unless the defendant knows that the defendant can thereby secure the complete safety of the other person. (c) When the person whom the defendant seeks to protect would have been obliged under \u00a7 464 of this title to retreat, to surrender the possession of a thing or to comply with a demand if the person knew that the person could obtain complete safety by so doing, the defendant is obliged to try to cause the person to do so before using force in the person's protection if the actor knows that complete safety can be secured in that way. (d) Neither the defendant nor the person whom the defendant seeks to protect is obliged to retreat when in the other's dwelling or place of work to any greater extent than in their own. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 465; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 83 Del. Laws, c. 73, \u00a7 2.) \u00a7 466. Justification \u2014 Use of force for the protection of property. (a) The use of force upon or toward the person of another is justifiable when the defendant reasonably believes that such force is immediately necessary: (1) To prevent the commission of criminal trespass or burglary in a building or upon real property in the defendant's possession or in the possession of another person for whose protection the defendant acts; or (2) To prevent entry upon real property in the defendant's possession or in the possession of another person for whose protection the defendant acts; or (3) To prevent theft, criminal mischief or any trespassory taking of tangible, movable property in the defendant's possession or in the possession of another person for whose protection the defendant acts. (b) The defendant may in the circumstances named in subsection (a) of this section use such force as the defendant reasonably believes is necessary to protect the threatened property, provided that the defendant first requests the person against whom force is used to desist from interference with the property, unless the defendant reasonably believes that: (1) Such a request would be useless; or (2) It would be dangerous to the defendant or another person to make the request; or (3) Substantial harm would be done to the physical condition of the property which is sought to be protected before the request could effectively be made. (c) The use of deadly force for the protection of property is justifiable only if the defendant reasonably believes that: (1) The person against whom the force is used is attempting to dispossess the defendant of the defendant's dwelling otherwise than under a claim of right to its possession; or (2) The person against whom the deadly force is used is attempting to commit arson, burglary, robbery or felonious theft or property destruction and either: a. Had employed or threatened deadly force against or in the presence of the defendant; or b. Under the circumstances existing at the time, the defendant reasonably believed the use of force other than deadly force would expose the defendant, or another person in the defendant's presence, to the reasonable likelihood of serious physical injury. (d) Where a person has used force for the protection of property and has not been convicted for any crime or offense connected with that use of force, such person shall not be liable for damages or be otherwise civilly liable to the one against whom such force was used. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 466; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 62 Del. Laws, c. 266, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 83 Del. Laws, c. 73, \u00a7 3.) \u00a7 467. Justification \u2014 Use of force in law enforcement. (a) The use of force upon or toward the person of another is justifiable when: (1) The defendant is making an arrest or assisting in making an arrest and reasonably believes that such force is immediately necessary to effect the arrest; or (2) The defendant is attempting to arrest an individual that has taken a hostage, and refused to comply with an order to release the hostage; and a. The defendant reasonably believes that the use of force is necessary to prevent physical harm to any person taken hostage; or b. The defendant has been ordered by an individual the defendant reasonably believes possesses superior authority or knowledge to apply the use of force. (b) The use of force is not justifiable under this section unless: (1) The defendant makes known the purpose of the arrest or reasonably believes that it is otherwise known or cannot reasonably be made known to the person to be arrested; andTitle 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 21(2) When the arrest is made under a warrant, the warrant is valid or reasonably believed by the defendant to be valid; or (3) When the arrest is made without a warrant, the defendant reasonably believes the arrest to be lawful. (c) The use of deadly force is justifiable under this section if all other reasonable means of apprehension have been exhausted, and: (1) The defendant reasonably believes the arrest is for any crime involving physical injury or threat thereof, and the deadly force is directed at a vehicle to disable it for the purpose of effecting the arrest, or the defendant reasonably believes the arrest is for a felony involving physical injury or threat thereof; (2) The defendant reasonably believes that the force employed creates no substantial risk of injury to innocent persons; and (3) The defendant reasonably believes that there is a substantial risk that the person to be arrested will cause death or serious physical injury, or will never be captured if apprehension is delayed. (d) The use of force to prevent the escape of an arrested person from custody is justifiable when the force could justifiably have been employed to effect the arrest under which the person is in custody, except that a guard or other person authorized to act as a peace officer is justified in using any force, including deadly force, which the person reasonably believes to be immediately necessary to prevent the escape of a person from a jail, prison or other institution for the detention of persons charged with or convicted of a crime. (e) The use of force upon or toward the person of another is justifiable when the defendant reasonably believes that such force is immediately necessary to prevent such other person from committing suicide, inflicting serious physical injury upon the person's self or committing a crime involving or threatening physical injury, damage to or loss of property or a breach of the peace, except that the use of deadly force is not justifiable under this subsection unless: (1) The defendant reasonably believes that there is a substantial risk that the person whom the defendant seeks to prevent from committing a crime will cause death or serious physical injury to another unless the commission of the crime is prevented and that the use of deadly force presents no substantial risk of injury to innocent persons; or (2) The defendant reasonably believes that the use of deadly force is necessary to suppress a riot or mutiny after the rioters or mutineers have been ordered to disperse and warned, in any manner that the law may require, that such force will be used if they do not obey. (f) The use of deadly force is justifiable under this section if the defendant is attempting to arrest an individual that has taken a hostage, and has refused to comply with an order to release the hostage; and (1) The defendant reasonably believes that the use of force is necessary to prevent physical harm to any person taken hostage, or the defendant has been ordered by an individual the defendant reasonably believes possesses superior authority or knowledge to apply the use of force; and (2) The defendant reasonably believes that the force employed creates no substantial risk of injury to innocent persons; and (3) The defendant or a person of superior authority or knowledge who order the use of deadly force reasonably believes that there is a substantial risk that the person to be arrested will cause death or serious physical injury.

Laws, c. 73, \u00a7 4.) \u00a7 468. Justification \u2014 Use of force by persons with special responsibility for care, discipline or safety of others. The use of force upon or toward the person of another is justifiable if it is reasonable and moderate and: (1) The defendant is the parent, guardian, foster parent, legal custodian or other person similarly responsible for the general care and supervision of a child, or a person acting at the request of a parent, guardian, foster parent, legal custodian or other responsible person, and: a. The force is used for the purpose of safeguarding or promoting the welfare of the child, including the prevention or punishment of misconduct; and b. The force used is intended to benefit the child, or for the special purposes listed in paragraphs (2)a., (3)a., (4)a., (5), (6) and (7) of this section. The size, age, condition of the child, location of the force and the strength and duration of the force shall be factors considered in determining whether the force used is reasonable and moderate; but c. The force shall not be justified if it includes, but is not limited to, any of the following: Throwing the child, kicking, burning, cutting, striking with a closed fist, interfering with breathing, use of or threatened use of a deadly weapon, prolonged deprivation of sustenance or medication, or doing any other act that is likely to cause or does cause physical injury, disfigurement, mental distress, unnecessary degradation or substantial risk of serious physical injury or death; or (2) The defendant is a teacher or a person otherwise entrusted with the care or supervision of a child for a special purpose, and: a. The defendant reasonably believes the force used is necessary to further the special purpose, including the maintenance of reasonable discipline in a school, class or other group, and that the use of force is consistent with the welfare of the child; and b. The degree of force, if it had been used by the parent, guardian, foster parent or legal custodian of the child, would be justifiable under paragraph (1)a. and b. of this section and not enumerated under paragraph (1)c. of this section; or (3) The defendant is the guardian or other person similarly responsible for the general care and supervision of a person who is incompetent, and:Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 22a. The force is used for the purpose of safeguarding or promoting the welfare of the person who is incompetent, including the prevention of misconduct, or, when such person who is incompetent is in a hospital or other institution for care and custody, for the maintenance of reasonable discipline in such institution; and b. The force used is reasonable and moderate; the size, age, condition of the person who is incompetent, location of the force and the strength and duration of the force shall be factors considered in determining whether the force used is reasonable and moderate; and c. The force is not enumerated under paragraph (1)c. of this section; and d. The force is not proscribed as abuse or mistreatment under Chapter 11 of Title 16; or (4) The defendant is a doctor or other therapist or a person assisting at the doctor's or other therapist's direction, and: a. The force is used for the purpose of administering a recognized form of treatment which the defendant reasonably believes to be adapted to promoting the physical or mental health of the patient; and b. The treatment is administered with the consent of the patient or, if the patient is a minor or a person who is incompetent, with the consent of a parent, guardian or other person legally competent to consent in the patient's behalf, or the treatment is administered in an emergency when the defendant reasonably believes that no one competent to consent can be consulted and that a reasonable person, wishing to safeguard the welfare of the patient, would consent; or (5) The defendant is a warden or other authorized official of a correctional institution, or a superintendent, administrator or other authorized official of the Division of Youth Rehabilitative Service, and: a. The defendant reasonably believes that the force used is necessary for the purpose of enforcing the lawful rules or procedures of the institution; and b. The nature or degree of force used is not forbidden by any statute governing the administration of the institution; and c. If deadly force is used, its use is otherwise justifiable under this Criminal Code; or (6) The defendant is a person responsible for the safety of a vessel or an aircraft or a person acting at the responsible person's direction, and: a. The defendant reasonably believes that the force used is necessary to prevent interference with the operation of the vessel or aircraft or obstruction of the execution of a lawful order; and b. If deadly force is used, its use is otherwise justifiable under this Criminal Code; or (7) The defendant is a person who is authorized or required by law to maintain order or decorum in a vehicle, train or other carrier or in a place where others are assembled, and: a. The defendant reasonably believes that the force used is necessary for such purpose; and b. The force used is not designed to cause or known to create a substantial risk of causing death, physical injury or extreme mental distress. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 468; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 68 Del. Laws, c. 442, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 4; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 78 Del. Laws, c. 224, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 13; 83 Del. Laws, c. 73, \u00a7 5.) \u00a7 469. Justification \u2014 Person unlawfully in dwelling. In the prosecution of an occupant of a dwelling charged with killing or injuring an intruder who was unlawfully in said dwelling, it shall be a defense that the occupant was in the occupant's own dwelling at the time of the offense, and: (1) The encounter between the occupant and intruder was sudden and unexpected, compelling the occupant to act instantly; or (2) The occupant reasonably believed that the intruder would inflict personal injury upon the occupant or others in the dwelling; or (3) The occupant demanded that the intruder disarm or surrender, and the intruder refused to do so. (63 Del. Laws, c. 276, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 470. Provisions generally applicable to justification. (a) When the defendant reasonably believes that the use of force upon or toward the person of another is necessary for any of the purposes for which such relief would establish a justification under \u00a7 \u00a7 462-468 of this title but the defendant is reckless or negligent in having such belief or in acquiring or failing to acquire any knowledge or belief which is material to the justifiability of the use of force, the justification afforded by those sections is unavailable in a prosecution for an offense for which recklessness or negligence, as the case may be, suffices to establish culpability. (b) When the defendant is justified under \u00a7\u00a7 462-468 of this title in using force upon or toward the person of another but the defendant recklessly or negligently injures or creates a risk of injury to innocent persons, the justification afforded by those sections is unavailable in a prosecution for an offense involving recklessness or negligence towards innocent persons. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 469; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 63 Del. Laws, c. 276, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 83 Del. Laws, c. 73, \u00a7 6.) \u00a7 471. Definitions relating to justification. (a) \"Deadly force\" means force which the defendant uses with the purpose of causing or which the defendant knows creates a substantial risk of causing death or serious physical injury, including the use of a chokehold as \"chokehold\" is defined under \u00a7 607A of this title.Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 23Purposely firing a firearm in the direction of another person or at a vehicle in which another person is believed to be constitutes deadly force. A threat to cause death or serious bodily harm, by the production of a weapon or otherwise, so long as the defendant's purpose is limited to creating an apprehension that deadly force will be used if necessary, does not constitute deadly force. (b) \"Dwelling\" means any building or structure, though movable or temporary, or a portion thereof, which is for the time being the defendant's home or place of lodging. (c) \"Force,\" in addition to its ordinary meaning, includes confinement. (d) \"Physical force\" means force used upon or directed toward the body of another person. (e) (1) \"Reasonably believes,\" when applied to a defendant who is not a law-enforcement officer acting in the officer's official capacity, means holds a belief that is reasonable from the viewpoint of a reasonable person in the defendant's situation under the circumstances. (2) \"Reasonably believes,\" when applied to a defendant who is a law-enforcement officer acting in the officer's official capacity, means holds a belief that is reasonable from the viewpoint of a reasonable law-enforcement officer in the defendant's situation under the circumstances. (f) \"Unlawful force\" means force which is employed without the consent of the person against whom it is directed and the employment of which constitutes an offense or actionable tort or would constitute such offense or tort except for a defense (such as the absence of intent, negligence or mental capacity; duress; youth; or diplomatic status) not amounting to a privilege to use the force. Assent constitutes consent, within the meaning of this section, whether or not it otherwise is legally effective, except assent to the infliction of death or serious bodily harm. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 470; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 63 Del. Laws, c. 276, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 83 Laws, c. 73, \u00a7 7.) \u00a7\u00a7 472-474. [Reserved.] \u00a7 475. Immunity as an affirmative defense. In any prosecution for an offense, it is an affirmative defense that the accused was granted immunity from prosecution for that offense by the Attorney General or a Deputy Attorney General or by court order pursuant to \u00a7 3506 of this title. It is also an affirmative defense that the accused was granted immunity from prosecution for a different offense when prosecution for the offense now charged would have been barred by prosecution for the offense as to which immunity was granted under \u00a7 208 of this title; provided, that the Attorney General or a Deputy Attorney General may, in granting immunity, stipulate that the immunity applies only to a specific offense, in which case effect shall be given to the stipulation. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 475; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 1; 63 Del. Laws, c. 271, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 476. Racketeering activities; excluded defenses. (a) In any prosecution under Chapter 15 of this title where it is alleged that the offender or offenders were acting as members of a group or informal organization it shall be no defense to such prosecution or were engaged in any form of racketeering or racketeering activity, that: (1) One or more members of the group or organization are not criminally responsible for the offense for which the prosecution is brought; (2) One or more members of the group or organization have been acquitted, have not been prosecuted or convicted, have been convicted of a different offense or are immune from prosecution; (3) A different person has been charged with, acquitted or convicted of any offense set forth in Chapter 15 of this title. (b) Once an act of racketeering has been initiated by a group and there is a subsequent change in the number or identity of persons in such group or organization, as long as 2 or more of the original members remain in such group or are involved in a continuing course of conduct constituting an offense under Chapter 15 of this title, it shall be no defense to claim that the defendant was not part of the group or organization. (65 Del. Laws, c. 493, \u00a7 2; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 477. Organized crime; renunciation. (a) It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution under \u00a7 1503 of this title, that under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete renunciation of the criminal objective, the defendant withdrew from the proposed or intended unlawful activity before the commission of an offense set forth in Chapter 15 of this title; and that such person took further affirmative action that, in whole or in part, prevented the commission of the offense. (b) Renunciation is not \"voluntary,\" if it is motivated in whole or in part: (1) By circumstances not present or apparent at the inception of the defendant's course of conduct that increased the probability of detection or apprehension, or that made more difficult the accomplishment of the objective; or (2) By a decision to postpone the criminal conduct until another time, or to transfer the criminal act to another (but similar) objective or victim.Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 24(c) Evidence that the defendant withdrew from the unlawful activity before commission of an offense set forth in Chapter 15 of this title, and made substantial effort to prevent the commission of an offense under that chapter, shall be admissible as mitigation at the hearing on punishment if such person has been found guilty; and in the event of a finding of renunciation under this section, the punishment of such person shall be less than that which would otherwise be imposed. The Court shall determine the extent and genuineness of the renunciation, and determine the reduction. (65 Del. Laws, c. 493, \u00a7 2; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.)Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 25Part I Delaware Criminal Code Chapter 5 Specific Offenses Subchapter I Inchoate Crimes \u00a7 501.

(f) Admissibility of certain evidence. \u2014 In a prosecution or civil action for damages under this section, evidence of a specific instance of the alleged victim's past sexual behavior, or reputation or opinion evidence of past sexual behavior of the alleged victim, is not admissible unless the evidence is: (1) Admitted in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 3508 and 3509 of this title; or (2) Offered by the prosecution in a criminal case to prove a pattern of trafficking by the defendant.

Such motion may be opposed by the Attorney General. The Family Court may consider such a motion and, in its discretion, may stay the juvenile delinquency proceeding indefinitely. Upon such motion, the Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families and/or the Family Court may identify and order available specialized services for the minor that, in the opinion of the Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families or Family Court, are best suited to the needs of the juvenile.

Official documentation of the person's status as a victim of this section, \"trafficking in persons\", or \"a severe form of trafficking\" from a federal, state, or local government agency shall create a presumption that the person's participation in any crime, except those deemed to be violent felonies pursuant to \u00a7 4201 of this title, committed was a direct result of having been a victim of human trafficking but shall not be required for the court to grant a petition under this paragraph.

If the court grants the motion to vacate the adjudication of delinquency or conviction under paragraph (j)(2) of this section and the movant also requested expungement, the court's order shall require expungement of the police and court records relating to the charge and conviction or adjudication of delinquency.

The prosecution may be conducted as follows: (1) The indictment or information may set forth the 2 statements and, without designating either, charge that 1 of them is false and perjurious. (2) The falsity of one or the other of the 2 statements may be established by proof of their irreconcilable inconsistency. Such proof is sufficient to establish a prima facie case of falsity. (3) If perjury of different degrees would be established by the making of the 2 statements, hypothetically assuming that each is false and perjurious, the defendant may be convicted of the lesser degree at most.

It is the intent of the General Assembly in enacting this chapter to place restrictions on the possession and use of assault weapons. It is not, however, the intent of the General Assembly by this chapter to place restrictions on the use of those weapons which are primarily designed and intended for hunting, target practice, or other legitimate sports or recreational activities.

The interests of an innocent party in the property shall not be subject to forfeiture. (e) The Court may, upon such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, order that the property be sold by an innocent party who holds a lien on, or security interest in, the property at any time during the proceedings. Any proceeds from such sale, over and upon the amount necessary to satisfy the lien or security interest, shall be paid into the court pending final judgment in the forfeiture proceeding. No such sale shall be ordered, however, unless the obligation upon which the lien or security interest is based is in default. (f) The proceeds of any sale or other disposition of forfeited property imposed under this chapter, whether by final judgment, settlement or otherwise, shall be applied in the following order: (1) To the fees and costs of the forfeiture and sale, including expenses of seizure, maintenance and custody of the property pending its disposition, advertising and court costs; (2) If any funds remain, then to all costs and expenses of investigation and prosecution, including costs of resources and personnel incurred in investigation and prosecution; (3) If any funds remain, then the remainder or $1,000, whichever is less, to the Crime Victim Compensation Fund; (4) If any funds remain, to the Special Law Enforcement Assistance Fund, or its successor; or if no such fund is in existence, to the fund which is dedicated entirely to law enforcement. (65 Del. Laws, c. 493, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 1507. Racketeering lien notice; lis pendens; construction of section. (a) Upon the institution of any criminal or civil proceeding under this chapter, the State, then or at any time during the pendency of the proceedings, may file in the official records of any 1 or more counties of this State, a racketeering (or \"R.I.C.O.\") lien notice. Such notice shall create, and be equivalent to, a lien. No filing fee or other charge shall be required as a condition for filing such lien notice, and the Prothonotary shall, upon the presentation of the lien notice, immediately record it in the official records. (b) The racketeering (R.I.C.O.) lien notice shall be signed by the Attorney General, the Chief Deputy Attorney General or the State Prosecutor. The notice shall be in such form as the Attorney General shall prescribe and shall set forth the following information: (1) The name of the person against whom the civil proceeding has been brought. The notice may, but is not required to, list any other aliases, names or fictitious titles under which the person may be known. In its discretion the State may also list any corporation, partnership or other entity which is owned or controlled by such person; (2) If known to the Attorney General, the present residence and business address of the person named in the racketeering lien notice, and addresses for other names set forth in such lien notice; (3) A reference to the criminal or civil proceeding, stating that a proceeding under this chapter has been brought against the person named in the racketeering lien notice, and including the name of the county or counties where the proceeding has been initiated; (4) A statement that the notice is being filed pursuant to this chapter; (5) The name and address of the agency within the State Department of Justice that can answer any further questions; and (6) Such other information as the Attorney General shall deem appropriate. (c) The Attorney General or a Deputy Attorney General may amend any lien filed under this section at any time, by filing an amended racketeering lien in the same manner as a R.I.C.O. lien. An amended racketeering lien shall identify, with reasonable certainty, the lien which is being amended. (d) The Attorney General or a Deputy Attorney General shall, as soon as practicable after filing the racketeering lien notice, furnish to any person named in the lien a notice of the filing of such lien. The notice may be mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested. Failure to notify the person named in the lien in accordance with this subsection shall not invalidate nor otherwise affect any racketeering lien notice filed in accordance with this section. (e) A racketeering lien is perfected against interests in personal property by filing the lien notice with the Secretary of State, except that in the case of a titled motor vehicle it shall be filed with the Division of Motor Vehicles. A racketeering lien is perfected against interests in real property by filing the lien notice with the Prothonotary in the county in which the real property is located. The State may give such additional notice of the lien as it deems appropriate. (f) The filing of a notice of lien in accordance with this section creates a lien in favor of the State in: (1) Any interest of the defendant in real property situated in the county in which the lien notice is filed, then maintained or thereafter acquired in the name of the defendant identified in the notice; (2) Any interest of the defendant in personal property situated in this State, then maintained or thereafter acquired in the name of the defendant identified in the lien notice; and (3) Any property identified in the lien notice to the extent of the defendant's interest therein. (g) The filing of a racketeering lien notice under this section is notice to all persons dealing with the person or property identified in the lien of the State's claim. The lien created in favor of the State in accordance with this section is superior to and prior to the claims and interests of any other person, except a person possessing:Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 173(1) A valid lien perfected prior to the filing of the racketeering lien notice; (2) In the case of real property, an interest acquired and recorded prior to the filing of the racketeering lien notice; or (3) In the case of personal property, an interest acquired prior to the filing of the racketeering lien notice. (h) Where a trustee conveys title to real property against which a R.I.C.O. lien notice has been filed; and the lien notice has been filed in the county in which the property is located and names a person who, to the actual knowledge of the trustee, holds a beneficial interest in the trust, the trustee shall be liable to the State for the greater of: (1) The amount of proceeds received directly by the person named in the R.I.C.O. lien notice, as a result of the conveyance; (2) The amount of proceeds received by the trustee as a result of the conveyance, and distributed to any person named in the lien notice; or (3) The fair market value of the interest of the person named in the lien notice in the real property so conveyed; provided, however, that if the trustee conveys the real property, and holds proceeds that would otherwise be paid or distributed to the beneficiary (or at the direction of the beneficiary or the beneficiary's designee), the trustee's liability shall not exceed the amount of the proceeds so held for so long as the proceeds are held by the trustee. (i) Upon entry of judgment in favor of the State, the State may proceed to execute thereon as in the case of any other judgment, except that in order to preserve the State's lien priority, as provided in this section, the State shall (in addition to such other notice as is required by law) give at least 30 days' notice of such execution to any person, possessing at the time such notice is given, an interest recorded subsequent to the date the State's lien was perfected. (j) Upon the entry of a final judgment in favor of the State, or an order providing for forfeiture of property to the State, the title of the State to the property: (1) In the case of real property, or a beneficial interest in real property, relates back to the date of filing the racketeering lien notice; or if no racketeering lien notice was filed, then to the date of recording of the final judgment, or an abstract thereof, in the county where the real property is located. (2) In the case of personal property or a beneficial interest in personal property, relates back to the date the personal property was seized by the State, or the date of filing of a racketeering lien notice in accordance with this section, whichever is earlier; but if the property was not seized, and no racketeering lien was filed, then to the date the final judgment was filed with the Secretary of State, or in the case of a titled motor vehicle, with the Division of Motor Vehicles. (k) This section shall not limit any right of the State to obtain any order or injunction, receivership, writ, attachment, garnishment or other remedy; nor limit any right of action which is appropriate to protect the interests of the State, or which is available under other applicable law. (l) In the event the Attorney General determines that the provisions of this section are unclear or insufficient the Attorney General may petition the Superior Court for the promulgation of rules to further clarify, or more effectively accomplish, the intent of this chapter and of this section. Where any rule promulgated by the Court conflicts with any provision of this section, this section shall be paramount. (65 Del. Laws, c. 493, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 1508. Term of lien notice. (a) The term of a racketeering lien notice shall be for a period of 6 years from the date of filing, unless a renewal lien notice has been filed; and, in such case, the term of the renewal lien notice shall be for a period of 6 years from the date of its filing. The State shall be entitled to only 1 renewal of a specific racketeering lien notice. (b) The Attorney General may release, in whole or in part, any racketeering lien notice or may release any specific real property or beneficial interest from a lien notice upon such terms and conditions as the Attorney General, or the Court, may determine. Any release of a racketeering lien notice executed by the Attorney General may be filed in the official records of any county. No charge or fee shall be imposed for the filing of any release of a racketeering lien notice. (c) If no civil proceeding has been instituted by the Attorney General, seeking a forfeiture of any property owned by the person named in the racketeering lien notice, the acquittal in the criminal proceeding of such person named in the lien notice or the dismissal of the criminal proceeding, shall terminate the lien notice; and, in such case, the filing of the racketeering lien notice shall have no effect. Where a civil proceeding has been instituted, and the criminal proceeding has been dismissed, or the person named in the racketeering lien notice has been acquitted in the criminal proceeding, the lien notice shall continue for the duration of the civil proceeding. (d) If no civil proceeding is then pending against the person named in a R.I.C.O. lien notice, any person named in the lien notice may institute a civil action against the State, seeking a release or extinguishment of the State's lien. Notice of such civil action shall be filed in the county where the lien notice was filed. (65 Del. Laws, c. 493, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 1509. Investigative powers of Attorney General. (a) Whenever the Attorney General has reasonable cause to believe that any person or enterprise may have knowledge of, has been engaged in or is engaging in any conduct in violation of this chapter, the Attorney General may, in the Attorney General's discretion,Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 174conduct an investigation of such conduct. The Attorney General is authorized before the commencement of any civil or criminal proceeding under this chapter to subpoena witnesses.

(b) The production of documentary material in response to an investigative demand served under this section shall be made pursuant to a sworn certificate, in such form as the demand designates, by the person, if a natural person, to whom the demand is directed or, if not a natural person, by an individual having knowledge of the facts and circumstances relating to the production of materials, which certificate shall affirm that all of the documentary material required by the investigative demand and in the possession, custody or control of the person to whom the demand is directed has been produced and made available to the custodian. (c) The Attorney General may, in the Attorney General's discretion, require the production under this section of documentary materials prior to the taking of any testimony of the person subpoenaed. The required documentary materials shall be made available for inspection or copying during normal business hours at the principal place of business of the person served, or at such other time and place as may be agreed upon between the person served and the Attorney General. (d) The examination of all persons pursuant to this section shall be conducted by the Attorney General or by a person designated in writing to be the Attorney General's representative, before an officer chosen by the Attorney General who is authorized to administer oaths in this State. The statements made shall be taken down stenographically, or by a sound-recording device, and shall be transcribed. (e) No person shall, with intent to avoid, evade, prevent or obstruct compliance in whole or in part by any person with any duly served investigative demand of the Attorney General under this section, knowingly remove to any place, conceal, withhold, destroy, mutilate, alter or by any other means falsify any documentary material or materials that are the subject of the demand. A violation of this subsection is a class E felony. The Attorney General shall investigate suspected violations of this section. (f) In the event a witness subpoenaed under this section fails or refuses to appear, or to produce documentary materials as provided herein, or to give testimony relevant or material to an investigation, the Attorney General may petition the Superior Court in the county where the witness resides for an order requiring the witness to attend and testify, or to produce the documentary materials. Any failure or refusal by the witness to obey an order of the Court may be punishable by the Court as contempt. (65 Del. Laws, c. 493, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 1510.

A custodial interrogation to which \u00a7 2003 of this title otherwise applies need not be recorded electronically if recording is not feasible because of exigent circumstances. The law-enforcement officer conducting the interrogation shall record electronically an explanation of the exigent circumstances before conducting the interrogation, if feasible, or as soon as practicable after the interrogation is completed. (83 Del. Laws, c. 260, \u00a7 1; 83 Del. Laws, c. 447, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2006. Exception for individual's refusal to be recorded electronically.

The individual's agreement to participate without recording must be recorded in a written document that is signed by the individual. (b) If, during a custodial interrogation to which \u00a7 2003 of this title otherwise applies, the individual being interrogated indicates that the individual will not participate in further interrogation unless electronic recording ceases, the remainder of the custodial interrogation need not be recorded electronically. The individual's agreement to participate without recording must be recorded electronically. (c) A law-enforcement officer, with intent to avoid the requirement of electronic recording in \u00a7 2003 of this title, may not encourage an individual to request that a recording not be made. (83 Del. Laws, c. 260, \u00a7 1; 83 Del. Laws, c. 447, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2007. Exception for interrogation conducted by other jurisdiction. If a custodial interrogation occurs in another state in compliance with that state's law or is conducted by a federal law-enforcement agency in compliance with federal law, the interrogation need not be recorded electronically unless the interrogation is conducted with intent to avoid the requirement of electronic recording in \u00a7 2003 of this title.

If contemporaneous memorialization of the basis for the belief is not feasible, the memorialization must be made as soon as practicable after the interrogation is completed. (83 Del. Laws, c. 260, \u00a7 1; 83 Del. Laws, c. 447, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2009. Exception for equipment malfunction. (a) All or part of a custodial interrogation to which \u00a7 2003 of this title otherwise applies need not be recorded electronically to the extent that recording is not feasible because the available electronic recording equipment fails, despite reasonable maintenance of the equipment, and timely repair or replacement is not feasible. (b) If both audio and video recording of a custodial interrogation are otherwise required by \u00a7 2003 of this title, recording may be by audio alone or by the use of a body-worn camera if a technical problem in the video recording equipment prevents video recording, despite reasonable maintenance of the equipment, and timely repair or replacement is not feasible. (c) If both audio and video recording of a custodial interrogation are otherwise required by \u00a7 2003 of this title, recording may be by video alone or by the use of a body-worn camera if a technical problem in the audio recording equipment prevents audio recording, despite reasonable maintenance of the equipment, and timely repair or replacement is not feasible.Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 185(d) If a law-enforcement officer conducts a custodial interrogation under this section, the law-enforcement officer shall prepare a written or electronic report explaining the reasoning for the malfunction, to the best of the officer's knowledge, and summarizing the custodial interrogation process and the individual's statements. The law-enforcement officer shall prepare the report as soon as practicable after completing the interrogation. (83 Del. Laws, c. 260, \u00a7 1; 83 Del. Laws, c. 447, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2010. Burden of persuasion. If the prosecution relies on an exception in \u00a7\u00a7 2005 through 2009 of this title to justify a failure to record electronically a custodial interrogation, the prosecution must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the exception applies. (83 Del. Laws, c. 260, \u00a7 1; 83 Del. Laws, c. 447, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2011. Notice of intent to introduce unrecorded statement. If the prosecution intends to introduce in its case in chief a statement made by an individual during a custodial interrogation to which \u00a7 2003 of this title applies which was not recorded electronically, the prosecution shall serve the individual with written notice of that intent and of any exception on which the prosecution intends to rely. The prosecution must serve the notice no later than when the statement is provided to the individual as part of discovery. (83 Del. Laws, c. 260, \u00a7 1; 83 Del. Laws, c. 447, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2012. Procedural remedies. (a) Unless the court finds that an exception in \u00a7\u00a7 2005 through 2009 of this title applies, the court shall consider the failure to record electronically all or part of a custodial interrogation to which \u00a7 2003 of this title applies in determining whether a statement made during the interrogation is admissible, including whether it was voluntarily made. (b) If the court admits into evidence a statement made by an individual during a custodial interrogation that was not recorded electronically in compliance with \u00a7 2003 of this title, the court shall afford the individual the opportunity to present to the jury the fact that the statement was not recorded electronically in compliance with \u00a7 2003 of this title. (83 Del. Laws, c. 260, \u00a7 1; 83 Del. Laws, c. 447, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2013. Handling and preserving an electronic recording. Each law-enforcement agency in this State shall establish and enforce procedures to ensure that the electronic recording of all or part of a custodial interrogation and a report or other document required to be prepared under this subchapter is identified, accessible, and preserved consistent with the law of this State governing the preservation of evidence in criminal and delinquency cases. (83 Del. Laws, c. 260, \u00a7 1; 83 Del. Laws, c. 447, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2014. Rules relating to electronic recording.

(c) The rules adopted under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for video recording must contain standards for the angle, focus, and field of vision of a recording device, other than a body-worn camera, which reasonably promote accurate recording of a custodial interrogation at a place of detention and reliable assessment of its accuracy and completeness. In a place of detention, the recording device must be simultaneously focused on both the law-enforcement officer and the individual subject to the custodial interrogation. (83 Del. Laws, c. 260, \u00a7 1; 83 Del. Laws, c. 447, \u00a7 1; 84 Del. Laws, c. 149, \u00a7 13.) \u00a7 2015. Limitation of liability.

(b) The officer or agent of a demanding state to whom a prisoner has been delivered following extradition proceedings in another state, or to whom a prisoner has been delivered after waiving extradition in such other state, and who is passing through this State with such a prisoner for the purpose of immediately returning such prisoner to the demanding state may, when necessary, confine the prisoner in the jail of any county, town or city through which the officer passes; and the keeper of such jail shall receive and safely keep the prisoner until the officer or agent having charge of the prisoner is ready to proceed on the officer's route, such officer or agent, however, being chargeable with the expense of keeping. Such officer or agent shall produce and show to the keeper of such jail satisfactory written evidence of the fact that the officer is actually transporting such prisoner to the demanding state after a requisition by the executive authority of such demanding state.

The arrest of a person may be lawfully made by any peace officer or a private person, without a warrant, upon reasonable information that the accused stands charged in the courts of a state with a crime punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year, but when so arrested the accused shall be taken before a judge or justice of the peace with all practicable speed and complaint shall be made against the accused under oath setting forth the ground for the arrest as in \u00a7 2513 of this title, and thereafter the accused's answer shall be heard as if the accused had been arrested on a warrant. (41 Del. Laws, c. 213, \u00a7 14; 11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 2514; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2515. Commitment awaiting requisition; bail. If from the examination before the judge or justice of the peace it appears that the person held is the person charged with having committed the crime alleged and, except in cases arising under \u00a7 2506 of this title, that the person has fled from justice, the judge or justice of the peace shall, by a warrant reciting the accusation, commit the person to jail for such a time not exceeding 30 days and specified in the warrant, as will enable the arrest of the accused to be made under a warrant of the Governor on a requisition of the executive authority of the state having jurisdiction of the offense, unless the accused gives bail as provided in \u00a7 2516 of this title, or until the accused is legally discharged. (41 Del. Laws, c. 213, \u00a7 15; 11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 2515; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2516. Admission to bail; conditions of bond.

If the accused is not arrested under warrant of the Governor by the expiration of the time specified in the warrant or bond, a judge or justice of the peace may discharge the accused or may recommit the accused for a further period not to exceed 60 days, or a judge or justice of the peace may again take bail for the accused's appearance and surrender, as provided in \u00a7 2516 of this title, but within a period not to exceed 60 days after the date of such new bond. (41 Del. Laws, c. 213, \u00a7 17; 11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 2517; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2518. Forfeiture of bail. If the prisoner is admitted to bail, and fails to appear and surrender according to the conditions of the bond, the judge or justice of the peace by proper order shall declare the bond forfeited and order the accused's immediate arrest, without warrant if the accused is within this State. Recovery may be had on such bond in the name of the State as in the case of other bonds given by the accused in criminal proceedings within this State. (41 Del. Laws, c. 213, \u00a7 18; 11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 2518; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2519. Persons under criminal prosecution. If a criminal prosecution has been instituted against such person under the laws of this State and is still pending, the Governor, in the Governor's discretion, either may surrender the accused on demand of the executive authority of another state or hold the accused until the accused has been tried and discharged or convicted and punished in this State. (41 Del. Laws, c. 213, \u00a7 19; 11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 2519; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2520. Inquiry into guilt of accused. The guilt or innocence of the accused as to the crime of which the accused is charged may not be inquired into by the Governor or in any proceeding after the demand for extradition accompanied by a charge of crime in legal form as provided in this subchapter has been presented to the Governor, except as it is involved in identifying the person held as the person charged with the crime. (41 Del. Laws, c. 213, \u00a7 20; 11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 2520; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.)Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 220\u00a7 2521. Recall of warrant; issuance of alias.

Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2522. Warrant to receive fugitive from State.

(41 Del. Laws, c. 213, \u00a7 22; 11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 2522; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2523. Application for issuance of requisition.

(b) When the return to this State is required of a person who has been convicted of a crime in this State and has escaped from confinement or broken the terms of bail, probation or parole, the Attorney General or any Deputy Attorney General, the parole board, or any agent thereof, probation or court officer, or the warden of the institution or sheriff of the county, from which escape was made, shall present to the Governor a written application for a requisition for the return of such person, in which application shall be stated the name of the person, the crime of which the person was convicted, the circumstances of the person's escape from confinement or of the breach of the terms of bail, probation or parole, the state in which the person is believed to be, including the location of the person therein, at the time application is made.

Costs and expenses. (a) The actual expenses of agents appointed by the Governor to serve requisition papers may be paid indirectly, by having the agent pay the agent's own expenses and then later seek reimbursement by submitting receipts to the State Treasurer; or they may be paid directly, by having the agent pay for the expenses with a credit card registered in the name of the Department of Justice. (1) When the indirect method is chosen, the agent shall be reimbursed only for reasonable, authorized, extradition-related expenses. Further, the State Treasurer shall reimburse the agent only for receipts that have been approved by the Attorney General or 1 of the Attorney General's deputies.

A person brought into this State by, or after waiver of, extradition based on a criminal charge shall not be subject to service of personal process in civil actions arising out of the same facts as the criminal proceedings to answer which the person is being or has been returned, until the person has been convicted in the criminal proceeding, or, if acquitted, until the person has had reasonable opportunity to return to the state from which the person was extradited. (41 Del. Laws, c. 213, \u00a7 25; 11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 2525; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2526. Waiver of requisition. Any person arrested or detained for the commission of a crime in a foreign jurisdiction, may, after the rights to demand requisition papers have been fully explained, waive requisition and consent to return to the jurisdiction in which the person is wanted. The waiver of requisition shall be in writing, and shall set forth that the person voluntarily waives requisition and that the person's rights have been fully explained and are understood, which shall be signed by the prisoner and 3 other witnesses in the prisoner's presence. The proper signing of such a waiver of requisition shall constitute ample authority for the sheriff, or other officer having the prisoner in custody, to deliver the prisoner to the duly authorized agent commissioned to receive the prisoner. The sheriff, or other officer having the prisoner in charge, before the officer surrenders the prisoner shall be satisfied that the agent is duly authorized and commissioned to receive the prisoner, and shall, unless the agent is a known peace officer, demand and retain the agent's warrant of authority, which the officer shall file and preserve together with the prisoner's waiver of requisition. (41 Del. Laws, c. 213, \u00a7 25a; 11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 2526; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2527. Preservation of rights of State.

C. 1953, \u00a7 2530.) Uniform Agreement on Detainers \u00a7 2540. Preamble; purpose. The Agreement on Detainers is enacted into law and entered into by this State with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows: The contracting states solemnly agree that the party states find that charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints, and difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation. Accordingly, it is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints. The party states also find that proceedings with reference to such charges and detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of cooperative procedures. It is the further purpose of this agreement to provide such cooperative procedures. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 2540; 57 Del. Laws, c. 223, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2541. Definitions.

(a) Whenever a person has entered upon a term of imprisonment in a penal or correctional institution of a party state, and whenever during the continuance of the term of imprisonment there is pending in any other party state any untried indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which a detainer has been lodged against the prisoner, the prisoner shall be brought to trial within 180 days after the prisoner shall have caused to be delivered to the prosecuting officer and the appropriate court of the prosecuting officer's jurisdiction written notice of the place of imprisonment and the request for a final disposition to be made of the indictment, information or complaint; provided, that for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or the prisoner's counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance. The request of the prisoner shall be accompanied by a certificate of the appropriate official having custody of the prisoner, stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner.

(c) The Commissioner of Correction, the Commissioner's delegated agent or other official having custody of the prisoner shall promptly inform the prisoner of the source and contents of any detainer lodged against the prisoner and shall also inform the prisoner of the right to make a request for final disposition of the indictment, information or complaint on which the detainer is based. (d) Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall operate as a request for final disposition of all untried indictments, informations or complaints on the basis of which detainers have been lodged against the prisoner from the state to whose prosecuting official the request for final disposition is specifically directed. The Commissioner of Correction or other official having custody of the prisoner shall forthwith notify all appropriate prosecuting officers and courts in the several jurisdictions within the state to which the prisoner's request for final disposition is being sent of the proceeding being initiated by the prisoner. Any notification sent pursuant to this subsection shall be accompanied by copies of the prisoner's written notice, request and the certificate. If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated by this section prior to the return of the prisoner to the original place of imprisonment, such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice. (e) Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall also be deemed to be a waiver of extradition with respect to any charge or proceeding contemplated thereby or included therein by reason of subsection (d) of this section, and a waiver of extradition to the receiving state to serve any sentence there imposed upon the prisoner, after completion of the term of imprisonment in the sending state. The request for final disposition shall also constitute a consent by the prisoner to the production of the prisoner's body in any court where the prisoner's presence may be required in order to effectuate the purposes of this agreement and a further consent voluntarily to be returned to the original place of imprisonment in accordance with this agreement. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the imposition of a concurrent sentence if otherwise permitted by law.

(11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 2542; 57 Del. Laws, c. 223, \u00a7 1; 63 Del. Laws, c. 32, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2543. Approval of court; disapproval of governor, trial; dismissal. (a) The appropriate officer of the jurisdiction in which an untried indictment, information or complaint is pending shall be entitled to have a prisoner against whom the officer has lodged a detainer and who is serving a term of imprisonment in any party state made available in accordance with \u00a7 2544(a) of this title, upon presentation of a written request for temporary custody or availability to the appropriate authorities of the state in which the prisoner is incarcerated; provided, that the court having jurisdiction of such indictment, information or complaint shall have duly approved, recorded and transmitted the request; and provided further, that there shall be a periodTitle 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 223of 30 days after receipt by the appropriate authorities before the request be honored, within which period the governor of the sending state may disapprove the request for temporary custody or availability, either upon the governor's own motion or upon motion of the prisoner.

(c) In respect of any proceeding made possible by this section, trial shall be commenced within 120 days of the arrival of the prisoner in the receiving state, but for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or the prisoner's counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance. (d) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to deprive any prisoner of any right which the prisoner may have to contest the legality of the prisoner's delivery as provided in subsection (a) of this section, but such delivery may not be opposed or denied on the ground that the executive authority of the sending state has not affirmatively consented to or ordered such delivery. (e) If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated by this section prior to the prisoner's being returned to the original place of imprisonment pursuant to \u00a7 2544(e) of this title, such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 2543; 57 Del. Laws, c. 223, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 2544. Delivery of temporary custody; refusal; return; responsibility.

If the request for final disposition is made by the prisoner, the offer of temporary custody shall accompany the written notice provided for in \u00a7 2542 of this title. In the case of a federal prisoner, the appropriate authority in the receiving state shall be entitled to temporary custody as provided by this agreement or to the prisoner's presence in federal custody at the place for trial, whichever custodial arrangement may be approved by the custodian. (b) The officer or other representative of a state accepting an offer of temporary custody shall present the following upon demand: (1) Proper identification and evidence of the officer's authority to act for the state into whose temporary custody the prisoner is to be given; (2) A duly certified copy of the indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged and on the basis of which the request for temporary custody of the prisoner has been made. (c) If the appropriate authority shall refuse or fail to accept temporary custody of the person, or in the event that an action on the indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged is not brought to trial within the period provided in \u00a7 2542 or \u00a7 2543 of this title, the appropriate court of the jurisdiction where the indictment, information or complaint has been pending shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice, and any detainer based thereon shall cease to be of any force or effect. (d) The temporary custody referred to in this agreement shall be only for the purpose of permitting prosecution on the charge or charges contained in 1 or more untried indictments, informations or complaints which form the basis of the detainer or detainers or for prosecution on any other charge or charges arising out of the same transaction. Except for attendance at court and while being transported to or from any place where the prisoner's presence may be required, the prisoner shall be held in a suitable jail or other facility regularly used for persons awaiting prosecution.

(g) For all purposes other than that for which temporary custody as provided in this agreement is exercised, the prisoner shall be deemed to remain in the custody of and subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and any escape from temporary custody may be dealt with in the same manner as an escape from the original place of imprisonment or in any other manner permitted by law. (h) From the time that a party state receives custody of a prisoner pursuant to this agreement until such prisoner is returned to the territory and custody of the sending state, the state in which the 1 or more untried indictments, informations or complaints are pending or in which trial is being had shall be responsible for the prisoner and shall also pay all costs of transporting, caring for, keeping and returning the prisoner. This subsection shall govern unless the states concerned shall have entered into a supplementary agreement providing for a different allocation of costs and responsibilities as between or among themselves. Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed to alter or affect any internal relationship among the department, agencies and officers of and in the government of a party state, or between a party state and its subdivisions, as to the payment of costs, or responsibilities therefor.

This agreement shall enter into full force and effect as to a party state when such state has enacted the same into law.

Such programs shall be structured in such a manner that the programs provide a continuing monitoring process as well as a continuum of treatment programs for each offender as that offender proceeds through the criminal justice system and may include, but shall not be limited to, group counseling, individual counseling, outpatient treatment, inpatient treatment, or treatment in a therapeutic community. Also, such programs shall be developed in such a manner that, to the extent possible, the programs continue to be accessible by all offenders in the criminal justice system. (3) On or before January 1, 2011, the Board shall consult on and approve the risk assessment screening instrument to assist any sentencing authority in determining the likelihood that an offender would commit 1 or more sex offenses. In carrying out this duty, the Board shall consider sex offender risk assessment research and shall consider as 1 element the risk posed by a sex offender who suffers from a mental abnormality, psychosis, or personality disorder that makes the person more likely to engage in sexually violent predatory offenses. (4) The Board shall develop criteria for measuring a sex offender's progress in treatment. The criteria shall be designed to assist the Courts and the State Board of Parole in determining whether a sex offender would pose an undue public safety threat to the community if that sex offender were released from incarceration, released to a reduced level of supervision, or discharged from probation or parole. The criteria shall not limit the decision-making authority of the courts or the State Board of Parole. (5) The Board shall research and analyze the effectiveness of the monitoring and tracking, evaluation, identification, classification, and treatment procedures and programs developed pursuant to this section. The Board shall also develop and prescribe a system for implementation of the guidelines and standards developed pursuant to this \u00a7 4120A and for tracking offenders who have been subjected to evaluation, identification, classification, and treatment pursuant to this section. The Board shall implement the guidelines and standards so developed in this \u00a7 4120A by no later than January 1, 2012. (6) The Board shall research and analyze the safety issues raised by living arrangements for and the location of sex offenders within the community, including but not limited to shared or structured living arrangements. At a minimum, the Board shall consider the issues raised by the location of sex offender residences, especially in proximity to public or private schools and child care facilities, and public notification of the location of sex offender residences. On or before July 15, 2010, the Board shall prepare and submit a report concerning the research and analysis conducted pursuant to this paragraph and any related legislative recommendations. The Board shall submit the report to the Public Safety, Judiciary and Corrections Committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate. On or before January 1, 2012, the Board shall adopt such guidelines as it may deem appropriate regarding the living arrangements and location of sex offenders. The Board shall accomplish the requirements specified in this paragraph within existing appropriations. (7) Prior to January 1, 2012, the Board, in collaboration with law-enforcement agencies, victim advocacy organizations, the Department of Education, and the Department of Safety and Homeland Security, shall develop, for use by schools, educational materials regarding general information about sex offenders, safety concerns related to sex offenders, and other relevant material. The Board shall provide these materials to the Department of Education, and the Department of Education shall make these materials available to schools in the State. (8) The Board and the individual members thereof shall be immune from any liability, whether civil or criminal, for the good faith performance of the duties of the Board as specified in this section except when such performance constitutes wilful or wanton conduct or gross negligence. (e) Each sex offender sentenced by a court for an offense committed on or after January 1, 2010, shall be required, as a part of any sentence to probation, community corrections, or incarceration with the Department of Correction, to undergo treatment to the extent appropriate to such offender based upon the recommendations of the evaluation and identification.Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 255(f) Each sex offender placed on parole by the State Board of Parole on or after January 1, 2010, shall be required, as a condition of such parole, to undergo treatment based upon the recommendations of the evaluation and identification regarding such offender during the offender's incarceration or any period of parole. (g) The Board shall require any person who applies for placement, including any person who applies for continued placement, on the list of persons who may provide sex offender treatment and sex offender services pursuant to this section, to submit fingerprints and other necessary information in order to obtain the following: (1) A report of the applicant's entire criminal history record from the State Bureau of Identification or a statement from the State Bureau of Identification that the State Bureau of Identification Central Repository contains no such information relating to that person. (2) A report of the applicant's entire federal criminal history record pursuant to the Federal Bureau of Investigation appropriation of Title II of Public Law 92-544 (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 534). The State Bureau of Identification shall be the intermediary for the purposes of this section and the Board shall be the screening point for the receipt of said federal criminal history records. (3) The Board may obtain such other information and recommendations from third parties which may be relevant to the applicant's fitness to provide sex offender treatment and sex offender services pursuant to this section. (h) The Board shall use the information obtained from the State and national criminal history record check and the current background investigation in determining whether to place or continue the placement of the person on the approved provider list.

In such cases, the agency or court which investigates the alleged noncompliance shall, upon a finding of probable cause that a violation has occurred, immediately notify the Superintendent of the Delaware State Police that a violation of the provisions of \u00a7 4120 of this title has occurred and that, as a result, the sex offender is redesignated to Risk Assessment Tier III until such time as the offender complies fully with \u00a7 4120 of this title. The agency or court shall also immediately notify the Superintendent of the Delaware State Police when the sex offender is again in compliance with \u00a7 4120 of this title, at which time the sex offender will be returned to that sex offender's originally designated Risk Assessment Tier. (n) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, any sex offender convicted of any offense specified in paragraph (a) (4)c. of this section shall be designated to a Risk Assessment Tier by the court.

The agency responsible for registering the offender shall have the information entered into the DELJIS system for any offender designated pursuant to subsection (n) of this section. (p) Any agency responsible for complying with this section shall be permitted to promulgate reasonable regulations, policies and procedures to implement this statute.

Laws, c. 175, \u00a7 9.) \u00a7 4122. Transition provisions. (a) Section 4121 of this title and this section shall be retroactively applicable to any person convicted of a registering offense. (b) Notwithstanding any law, rule or regulation to the contrary, as soon after March 1, 1999, as is practicable, the Attorney General shall apply \u00a7 4121 of this title to those persons identified by subsection (a) of this section, and will redesignate those persons to a Risk Assessment Tier pursuant to \u00a7 4121 of this title. Upon the redesignation, the Attorney General will provide notice of such redesignation by registered or certified mail to the person's last registered address, or by any other means which creates a reliable record of the receipt by the offender of such notice or of the attempts to provide the offender with the notice. The notice shall advise the person as to the duties and consequences imposed by law upon persons designated to the particular Risk Assessment Tier, and of the person's right to elect a hearing on the issue of the new Risk Assessment Tier designation. The Attorney General shall have the authority to promulgate reasonable regulations to implement this subsection. Such regulations shall be effective and enforceable upon their adoption, and shall not be subject to Chapters 11 and 101 of Title 29. (c) Any sex offender redesignated to a Risk Assessment Tier pursuant to this section shall have the right to request that the Superior Court review and finally determine such designation. The request shall be made in writing and delivered to the Superior Court within 10Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 261days of the receipt by the offender of the notice described in subsection (b) of this section. The Superior Court shall promptly forward a copy of the request to the Attorney General. Failure of the offender to deliver the request to the Superior Court within the time limits specified shall constitute a waiver of the offender's right to review. (d) Following receipt of timely notice by the Superior Court, it shall hold a hearing to determine the appropriateness of the Attorney General's new Risk Assessment Tier designation. The person and the Attorney General shall have the right to be heard at the hearing. This hearing shall not be held unless written notice of the hearing is provided to the Attorney General at least 30 days prior to the scheduled hearing date. A copy of the application for review shall be provided to the Attorney General along with written notice of the hearing date. (e), (f) [Repealed.] (g) Whenever an offender fails to elect a hearing in a timely fashion, the Attorney General shall forward notice of the redesignated Risk Assessment Tier to the Superintendent of the Delaware State Police and to the chief law-enforcement officer of the jurisdiction where the person is residing at the time of the redesignation. In the event the person requests a hearing, at the conclusion of the hearing, the Attorney General shall forward a notice of the redesignated Risk Assessment Tier to the Superintendent of the Delaware State Police and to the chief law-enforcement officer of the jurisdiction where the person is residing at the time of the redesignation. The Superintendent of the Delaware State Police shall enter information pertaining to any redesignation pursuant to this section into the DELJIS computer system. (h) Upon Risk Assessment Tier redesignation pursuant to this section, \u00a7\u00a7 4120 and 4121 of this title shall apply. Until redesignation, \u00a7\u00a7 4120 and 4336 of this title shall remain in full force and effect. (71 Del. Laws, c. 429, \u00a7 2; 76 Del. Laws, c. 374, \u00a7 25; 80 Del. Laws, c. 167, \u00a7 1; 81 Del. Laws, c. 277, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 4123. Juveniles adjudicated delinquent of sex offenses. (a) Notwithstanding any law, rule or regulation to the contrary, this section shall apply to any sex offender who was a juvenile on the date of the offense and adjudicated delinquent by the Family Court. (b) Prior to sentencing any juvenile adjudicated delinquent of a sex offense, Family Court shall order and receive a comprehensive evaluation, risk assessment and treatment recommendations for said juvenile by a certified mental health professional who specializes in the evaluation and/or treatment of juvenile sex offenders. If said juvenile is already in treatment at the time of adjudication, the current treatment provider may provide the evaluation, risk assessment and treatment recommendations required above. (c) Following receipt by Family Court and the parties of the comprehensive evaluation, risk assessment and treatment recommendations required by subsection (b) of this section, Family Court shall conduct a sentencing hearing in which the Court shall address appropriate treatment for the juvenile, and the registration and community notification requirements for the juvenile as follows: (1) If the juvenile was at least 14 years old on the date of the sex offense, and was adjudicated delinquent of any of the offenses enumerated in \u00a7 770(a)(3)a. of this title where \"without the victim's consent\" has the definition specified in or \u00a7 783A of this title if the purpose of the crime was to violate or abuse the victim sexually, \u00a7 787(b)(3) and (4), or \u00a7 1100A of this title, or if the victim of the felony level offense was 5 years old or younger, or of conspiracy, under \u00a7\u00a7 512 and 513 of this title, or attempt, under \u00a7 531 of this title, to commit any of those enumerated offenses, the juvenile shall be immediately registered as a sex offender as prescribed by \u00a7 4120 of this title, and the community shall be provided notification as prescribed by \u00a7 4121 of this title. The Family Court shall have no discretion to modify these registration or community notification requirements. (2) If the juvenile does not fit the criteria set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section above, the Family Court shall have the discretion to relieve the juvenile of registration and community notification requirements or to assign such juvenile to a lower tier than that prescribed by \u00a7 4121 of this title if the Court determines by a preponderance of the evidence that such juvenile is not likely to pose a threat to public safety if relieved of the requirements or assigned to a lower tier. In making this determination, the Family Court shall consider all relevant factors, including: a. The risk the juvenile poses to the victim, the community and to other potential victims; b. The nature and circumstances of the offense; c. The impact on the victim, including the effects of registration and community notification; d. The comprehensive evaluation, risk assessment and treatment recommendations or outcomes for the juvenile required by subsection (b) of this section; e. The likelihood of successful rehabilitation, if known; and f. The adverse impact of public registration on the juvenile and the rehabilitative process. (d) Any juvenile who does not fit the criteria set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section above and has been registered as a sex offender, may through his or her parent or guardian, or upon becoming an adult, petition Family Court for a registry review hearing as set forth below. Provided, however, that the prohibition involving offenses where the victim was 5 years old or younger shall not apply to this section. The Family Court shall hold the hearing at either the conclusion of treatment or 2 years from date of adjudication, whichever comes first. Family Court may maintain the current tier designation for the adjudicated offense pursuant to \u00a7 4121 of this title, or where it appears by a preponderance of the evidence after consideration of the factors set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section above that modification will not pose a threat to public safety, the Court may relieve the person of all registration and notification requirements or assign the person to a lower tier. All such petitions shall be filed in the Family Court in the county in which such case was adjudicated.Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 262The provisions of this paragraph shall be applicable whether the sex offender registration occurred prior to or after October 16, 2013, and in the case of adjudication occurring before October 16, 2011, the Family Court shall hold the review hearing as soon as practicable after receiving a petition. (e) If a juvenile does not fit the criteria of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the decision of the Family Court with regard to registration may be appealed by the State or the juvenile. (79 Del. Laws, c. 123, \u00a7 6; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 81 Del. Laws, c. 79, \u00a7 15; 82 Del.

No offense is a violation unless expressly declared to be a violation in this Criminal Code or in the statute defining the offense. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 4203; 58 Del. Laws, c. 497, \u00a7 2.) \u00a7 4204. Authorized disposition of convicted offenders. (a) Every person convicted of an offense shall be sentenced in accordance with this Criminal Code, with the exception of an environmental misdemeanor as defined in \u00a7 1304 of Title 7. This section applies to all judgments of conviction, whether entered after a trial or upon a plea of guilty or nolo contendere. (b) A person convicted of a class A felony may be sentenced to life imprisonment in accordance with \u00a7 4205 of this title, unless the conviction is for first-degree murder, in which event \u00a7 4209 of this title shall apply. Notwithstanding any other statute, a sentence under \u00a7 4209 of this title may not be suspended or reduced by the court. (c) When a person is convicted of any offense other than a class A felony the court may take the following action: (1) Impose a sentence involving an Accountability Level I sanction. \u2014 Such sanctions include imposition of a fine as provided by law for the offense or placement of the offender upon unsupervised probation with or without special conditions, or with or without the imposition of a fine as provided by law for the offense; (2) Impose a sentence involving an Accountability Level II sanction. \u2014 Such a sanction includes a placement of the offender upon supervised probation amounting to field supervision rather than intensive supervision, with or without special conditions, or with or without the imposition of a fine as provided by law for the offense; (3) Impose a sentence involving an Accountability Level III sanction. \u2014 Such sanctions include placement of the offender upon intensive supervision or placement of the offender upon community service, with or without special conditions, or with or without the imposition of a fine as provided by law for the offense. Such intensive supervision shall entail at least the equivalent of 1 hour of supervision per day and no more than 56 hours of supervision per week; (4) Impose a sentence involving an Accountability Level IV sanction. \u2014 Such sanctions include placement of the offender upon partial confinement under house arrest under the supervision of the Department of Correction or commitment of the offender to the DepartmentTitle 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 266of Correction under partial confinement to a half-way house or restitution center or placement of the offender in a residential treatment facility, all with or without special conditions, and all with or without the imposition of a fine as provided by law for the offense; (5) Impose a sentence involving an Accountability Level V sanction. \u2014 Such a sentence consists of the commitment of the offender to the Department of Correction for a period of incarceration, with or without the imposition of a fine provided by law for the offense; (6) Impose a period of incarceration, with or without the imposition of a fine provided by law for the offense, and placement of the offender in a less restrictive sanction, with or without special conditions, to commence when the offender is released from incarceration; (7) Suspend the imposition or execution of sentence, or suspend a portion thereof; (8) Impose any sentence as authorized in this subsection to include any special condition such as the payment of restitution to the victim or victims of the crime for which the offender is being sentenced and/or participation in a drug/alcohol outpatient treatment program, job training program, mental health treatment program, education program, community service program or other like programs. With regard to any such programs, the offender may be ordered to pay a fee covering, in whole or in part, the costs of such program and such fees shall be based upon the offender's ability to pay therefor; (9) Wherever a victim of crime suffers a monetary loss as a result of the defendant's criminal conduct, the sentencing court shall impose as a special condition of the sentence that the defendant make payment of restitution to the victim in such amount as to make the victim whole, insofar as possible, for the loss sustained. Notwithstanding any law, rule or regulation to the contrary, for the purposes of ensuring the payment of restitution the court shall retain jurisdiction over the offender until the amount of restitution ordered has been paid in full; (10) Whenever restitution is ordered pursuant to paragraph (c)(9) of this section or any other applicable statute or rule, and if deemed appropriate to ensure or facilitate the collection of restitution from the defendant or if otherwise required by statute, the court may impose a sentence involving an Accountability Level I\u2014Restitution Only sanction. Such a sanction shall be limited to the placement of the offender upon unsupervised probation, and the conditions of such probation shall be limited to those that are necessary to ensure or facilitate the collection of restitution. No offender shall be found to be in violation of the conditions of such a sanction unless the offender is found to be in violation of an applicable restitution order. (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Criminal Code to the contrary, probation or a suspended sentence shall not be substituted for imprisonment where the statute specifically indicates that a prison sentence is a mandatory sentence, a minimum sentence, a minimum mandatory sentence or a mandatory minimum sentence, or may not otherwise be suspended. (e) The court may authorize the payment of a fine in installments. When imposing probation the court shall direct that the offender be subject to the supervision of the Department of Correction and the court order shall specify those conditions under which the offender may remain at liberty on probation. (f) In committing an offender to the Department of Correction the court shall fix the maximum term of incarceration. (g) Where modification of judgment is not provided by rule of court, the court may modify a judgment within 90 days after it is ordered. Dispositions other than commitment to the Department of Correction, and such commitments which are revoked, shall not entail the loss by the offender of any civil rights, except as provided in the state Constitution. (h) The court may direct that a person placed on probation be released on entering into a recognizance, with or without surety, during such period as the court directs, to appear and receive sentence when called upon, and, in the meantime, to keep the peace and be of good behavior. (i) The court may, if it thinks proper, direct that the offender pay the costs of the prosecution or some portion thereof, and may further impose terms and conditions to be complied with by the offender during any period which it deems proper. (j) At any time within the period mentioned in the recognizance, but not afterwards, the court may, upon being satisfied by information on oath that the offender has failed to observe any of the conditions of recognizance, or any of the terms or conditions of probation, issue an order for the offender's apprehension and thereupon, after proper hearing, impose sentence upon the offender. (k) (1) Except as provided in this subsection, notwithstanding any statute, rule, regulation or guideline to the contrary, the court may direct as a condition to a sentence of imprisonment to be served at Level V or otherwise that all or a specified portion of said sentence shall be served without benefit of any form of early release, good time, furlough, work release, supervised custody or any other form of reduction or diminution of sentence. (2) For the purposes of this subsection, statutes which authorize early release, good time, furlough, work release, supervised custody, or reduction or diminution of sentence include but are not limited to \u00a7\u00a7 4205(h) and (i), [repealed] and 6537-6539 of this title. (3) The provisions of this subsection shall be applicable only to sentences of imprisonment at Level V for 1 year or less, or to sentences of imprisonment at Level V which are equal to the statutory maximum Level V sentence available for the crime or offense. (l) Except when the court imposes a life sentence or sentence of death, whenever a court imposes a period of incarceration at Level V custody for 1 or more offenses that totals 1 year or more, then that court must include as part of its sentence a period of custodial supervision at either Level IV, III or II for a period of not less than 6 months to facilitate the transition of the individual back into society. The 6-month transition period required by this subsection may, at the discretion of the court, be in addition to the maximum sentence of imprisonment established by the statute.Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 267(m) As a condition of any sentence, and regardless of whether such sentence includes a period of probation or suspension of sentence, the court may order the offender to engage in a specified act or acts, or to refrain from engaging in a specified act or acts, as deemed necessary by the court to ensure the public peace, the safety of the victim or the public, the rehabilitation of the offender, the satisfaction of the offender's restitution obligation to the victim or the offender's financial obligations to the State, or for any other purpose consistent with the interests of justice. The duration of any order entered pursuant to this subsection shall not exceed the maximum term of commitment provided by law for the offense or 1 year, whichever is greater; provided that in all cases where no commitment is provided by law the duration of such order shall not exceed 1 year. A violation of any order issued pursuant to this subsection shall be prosecuted pursuant to \u00a7 1271 of this title.

(1) If a child has reached the child's sixteenth birthday has been sentenced in Superior Court, the Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families ( \"The Department\" ) may file a motion in Superior Court to place the child in a secured detention facility other than a facility operated by the Department because the Department's secured detention facilities are at or beyond capacity or the child poses a security risk to self or other youth served by the Department in the facilities it operates. If a motion is filed, Superior Court shall conduct an evidentiary hearing unless the parties reach an agreement. (2) After an evidentiary hearing, the Superior Court may order the child to be placed in a secured detention facility not operated by the Department if the Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Department's secured detention facilities are at or beyond capacity and the child's safety or health is at risk by remaining at a facility operated by the Department. If the Court makes such a finding, the Department shall thereafter provide the Court with a status on the capacity of the Department's secured detention facilities at least weekly, and no child may be held in a secured detention facility for adults for more than 30 days. (3) After an evidentiary hearing, the Superior Court may order the child to be placed in a secured detention facility not operated by the Department if the Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the child is a danger to self or other youth served by the Department in the facilities it operates and the child's needs would be better served at a facility not operated by the Department. (c) [Repealed.] (d) (1) Notwithstanding any provision of this title to the contrary, any offender sentenced to an aggregate term of incarceration in excess of 20 years for any offense or offenses other than murder first degree that were committed prior to the offender's eighteenth birthday shall be eligible to petition the Superior Court for sentence modification after the offender has served 20 years of the originally imposed Level V sentence.

(3) Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection or title to the contrary, any offender who has petitioned the Superior Court for sentence modification pursuant to this subsection shall not be eligible to submit a second or subsequent petition until at least 5 years have elapsed since the date on which the Court ruled upon the offender's most recent petition. Further, the Superior Court shall have the discretion at the time of each sentence modification hearing to prohibit a subsequent sentence modification petition for a period of time in excess of 5 years if the Superior Court finds there to be no reasonable likelihood that the interests of justice will require another hearing within 5 years. (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 4205 or \u00a7 4217 of this title, any court rule or any other provision of law to the contrary, a Superior Court Judge upon consideration of a petition filed pursuant to this subsection (d), may modify, reduce or suspend such petitioner's sentence, including any minimum or mandatory sentence, or a portion thereof, in the discretion of the Court. Nothing in this section, however, shall require the Court to grant such a petitioner a sentence modification pursuant to this section.

(b) Separate hearing on issue of punishment for first-degree murder. \u2014 (1) Upon a conviction of guilt of a defendant of first-degree murder, the Superior Court shall conduct a separate hearing to determine whether the defendant should be sentenced to death or to life imprisonment without benefit of probation or parole as authorized by subsection (a) of this section. If the defendant was convicted of first-degree murder by a jury, this hearing shall be conducted by the trial judge before that jury as soon as practicable after the return of the verdict of guilty. Alternate jurors shall not be excused from the case prior to submission of the issue of guilt to the trial jury and may, but need not be, separately sequestered until a verdict on guilt is entered. If the verdict of the trial jury is guilty of first-degree murder said alternates shall sit as alternate jurors on the issue of punishment. If, for any reason satisfactory to the Court, any member of the trial jury is excused from participation in the hearing on punishment, the trial judge shall replace such juror or jurors with alternate juror or jurors. If a jury of 12 jurors cannot participate in the hearing a separate and new jury, plus alternates, shall be selected for the hearing in accordance with the applicable rules of the Superior Court and laws of Delaware, unless the defendant or defendants and the State stipulate to the use of a lesser number of jurors. (2) If the defendant was convicted of first-degree murder by the Court, after a trial and waiver of a jury trial or after a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the hearing shall be conducted by the trial judge before a jury, plus alternates, empaneled for that purpose and selected in accordance with the applicable rules of the Superior Court and laws of Delaware, unless said jury is waived by the State and the defendant in which case the hearing shall be conducted, if possible, by and before the trial judge who entered the finding of guilty or accepted the plea of guilty or nolo contendere. (c) Procedure at punishment hearing. \u2014 (1) The sole determination for the jury or judge at the hearing provided for by this section shall be the penalty to be imposed upon the defendant for the conviction of first-degree murder. At the hearing, evidence may be presented as to any matter that the Court deems relevant and admissible to the penalty to be imposed. The evidence shall include matters relating to any mitigating circumstance and to any aggravating circumstance, including, but not limited to, those aggravating circumstances enumerated in subsection (e) of this section. Notice in writing of any aggravating circumstances and any mitigating circumstances shall be given to the other side by the party seeking to introduce evidence of such circumstances prior to the punishment hearing, and after the verdict on guilt, unless in the discretion of the Court such advance notice is dispensed with as impracticable. The record of any prior criminal convictions and pleas of guilty or pleas of nolo contendere of the defendant or the absence of any such prior criminal convictions and pleas shall also be admissible in evidence. (2) At the hearing the Court shall permit argument by the State, the defendant and/or the defendant's counsel, on the punishment to be imposed. Such argument shall consist of opening statements by each, unless waived, opening summation by the State, rebuttal summation by the defendant and/or the defendant's counsel and closing summation by the State. (3) a. Upon the conclusion of the evidence and arguments the judge shall give the jury appropriate instructions and the jury shall retire to deliberate and report to the Court an answer to the following questions: 1. Whether the evidence shows beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of at least 1 aggravating circumstance as enumerated in subsection (e) of this section; and 2. Whether, by a preponderance of the evidence, after weighing all relevant evidence in aggravation or mitigation which bear upon the particular circumstances or details of the commission of the offense and the character and propensities of the offender, the aggravating circumstances found to exist outweigh the mitigating circumstances found to exist. b. 1. The jury shall report to the Court its finding on the question of the existence of statutory aggravating circumstances as enumerated in subsection (e) of this section. In order to find the existence of a statutory aggravating circumstance as enumerated in subsection (e) of this section beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury must be unanimous as to the existence of that statutory aggravating circumstance. As to any statutory aggravating circumstances enumerated in subsection (e) of this section which were alleged but for which the jury is not unanimous, the jury shall report the number of the affirmative and negative votes on each such circumstance. 2. The jury shall report to the Court by the number of the affirmative and negative votes its recommendation on the question as to whether, by a preponderance of the evidence, after weighing all relevant evidence in aggravation or mitigation which bearTitle 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 271upon the particular circumstances or details of the commission of the offense and the character and propensities of the offender, the aggravating circumstances found to exist outweigh the mitigating circumstances found to exist. (4) In the instructions to the jury the Court shall include instructions for it to weigh and consider any mitigating circumstances or aggravating circumstances and any of the statutory aggravating circumstances set forth in subsection (e) of this section which may be raised by the evidence. The jury shall be instructed to weigh any mitigating factors against the aggravating factors. (d) Determination of sentence. \u2014 (1) If a jury is impaneled, the Court shall discharge that jury after it has reported its findings and recommendation to the Court. A sentence of death shall not be imposed unless the jury, if a jury is impaneled, first finds unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of at least 1 statutory aggravating circumstance as enumerated in subsection (e) of this section. If a jury is not impaneled, a sentence of death shall not be imposed unless the Court finds beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of at least 1 statutory aggravating circumstance as enumerated in subsection (e) of this section. If a jury has been impaneled and if the existence of at least 1 statutory aggravating circumstance as enumerated in subsection (e) of this section has been found beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury, the Court, after considering the findings and recommendation of the jury and without hearing or reviewing any additional evidence, shall impose a sentence of death if the Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence, after weighing all relevant evidence in aggravation or mitigation which bears upon the particular circumstances or details of the commission of the offense and the character and propensities of the offender, that the aggravating circumstances found by the Court to exist outweigh the mitigating circumstances found by the Court to exist. The jury's recommendation concerning whether the aggravating circumstances found to exist outweigh the mitigating circumstances found to exist shall be given such consideration as deemed appropriate by the Court in light of the particular circumstances or details of the commission of the offense and the character and propensities of the offender as found to exist by the Court. The jury's recommendation shall not be binding upon the Court. If a jury has not been impaneled and if the existence of at least 1 statutory aggravating circumstance as enumerated in subsection (e) of this section has been found beyond a reasonable doubt by the Court, it shall impose a sentence of death if the Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence, after weighing all relevant evidence in aggravation or mitigation which bears upon the particular circumstances or details of the commission of the offense and the character and propensities of the offender, that the aggravating circumstances found by the Court to exist outweigh the mitigating circumstances found by the Court to exist. (2) Otherwise, the Court shall impose a sentence of imprisonment for the remainder of the defendant's natural life without benefit of probation or parole or any other reduction. (3) a. Not later than 90 days before trial the defendant may file a motion with the Court alleging that the defendant had a serious intellectual developmental disorder at the time the crime was committed. Upon the filing of the motion, the Court shall order an evaluation of the defendant for the purpose of providing evidence of the following: 1. Whether the defendant has a significantly subaverage level of intellectual functioning; 2. Whether the defendant's adaptive behavior is substantially impaired; and 3. Whether the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section existed before the defendant became 18 years of age. b. During the hearing authorized by subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the defendant and the State may present relevant and admissible evidence on the issue of the defendant's alleged serious intellectual developmental disorder, or in rebuttal thereof. The defendant shall have the burden of proof to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant had a serious intellectual developmental disorder at the time of the offense. Evidence presented during the hearing shall be considered by the jury in making its recommendation to the Court pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section as to whether the aggravating circumstances found to exist outweigh the mitigating circumstances found to exist. The jury shall not make any recommendation to the Court on the question of whether the defendant had a serious intellectual developmental disorder at the time the crime was committed. c. If the defendant files a motion pursuant to this paragraph claiming he or she had a serious intellectual developmental disorder at the time the crime was committed, the Court, in determining the sentence to be imposed, shall make specific findings as to the existence of a serious intellectual developmental disorder at the time the crime was committed. If the Court finds that the defendant has established by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant had a serious intellectual developmental disorder at the time the crime was committed, notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary, the Court shall impose a sentence of imprisonment for the remainder of the defendant's natural life without benefit of probation or parole or any other reduction. If the Court determines that the defendant has failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant had a serious intellectual developmental disorder at the time the crime was committed, the Court shall proceed to determine the sentence to be imposed pursuant to the provisions of this subsection. Evidence on the question of the defendant's alleged serious intellectual developmental disorder presented during the hearing shall be considered by the Court in its determination pursuant to this section as to whether the aggravating circumstances found to exist outweigh the mitigating circumstances found to exist. d. When used in this paragraph: 1. \"Adaptive behavior\" means the effectiveness or degree to which the individual meets the standards of personal independence expected of the individual's age group, sociocultural background and community setting, as evidenced by significant limitations in not less than 2 of the following adaptive skill areas: communication, self-care, home living, social skills, use of community resources, self-direction, functional academic skills, work, leisure, health or safety;Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 2722. \"Serious intellectual developmental disorder\" means that an individual has significantly subaverage intellectual functioning that exists concurrently with substantial deficits in adaptive behavior and both the significantly subaverage intellectual functioning and the deficits in adaptive behavior were manifested before the individual became 18 years of age; and 3. \"Significantly subaverage intellectual functioning\" means an intelligent quotient of 70 or below obtained by assessment with 1 or more of the standardized, individually administered general intelligence tests developed for the purpose of assessing intellectual functioning. (4) After the Court determines the sentence to be imposed, it shall set forth in writing the findings upon which its sentence is based. If a jury is impaneled, and if the Court's decision as to whether the aggravating circumstances found to exist outweigh the mitigating circumstances found to exist differs from the jury's recommended finding, the Court shall also state with specificity the reasons for its decision not to accept the jury's recommendation. (e) Aggravating circumstances. \u2014 (1) In order for a sentence of death to be imposed, the jury, unanimously, or the judge where applicable, must find that the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of at least 1 of the following aggravating circumstances which shall apply with equal force to accomplices convicted of such murder: a.

The murder was committed for the purpose of interfering with the victim's free exercise or enjoyment of any right, privilege or immunity protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, or because the victim has exercised or enjoyed said rights, or because of the victim's race, religion, color, disability, national origin or ancestry. (2) In any case where the defendant has been convicted of murder in the first degree in violation of any provision of \u00a7 636(a)(2)-(6) of this title, that conviction shall establish the existence of a statutory aggravating circumstance and the jury, or judge where appropriate, shall be so instructed. This provision shall not preclude the jury, or judge where applicable, from considering and finding the statutory aggravating circumstances listed in this subsection and any other aggravating circumstances established by the evidence. (f) Method and imposition of sentence of death. \u2014 The imposition of a sentence of death shall be upon such terms and conditions as the trial court may impose in its sentence, including the place, the number of witnesses which shall not exceed 10, and conditions of privacy, and shall occur between the hours of 12:01 a.m. and 3:00 a.m. on the date set by the trial court. The trial court shall permit one adult member of the immediate family of the victim, as defined in \u00a7 4350(e) of this title, or the victim's designee, to witness the execution of a sentence of death pursuant to the rules of the court, if the family provides reasonable notice of its desire to be so represented. Punishment of death shall, in all cases, be inflicted by intravenous injection of a substance or substances in a lethal quantity sufficient to cause death and until such person sentenced to death is dead, and such execution procedure shall be determined and supervised by the Commissioner of the Department of Correction. The administration of the required lethal substance or substances required by this section shall not be construed to be the practice of medicine and any pharmacist or pharmaceutical supplier is authorized to dispense drugs to the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee, without prescription, for carrying out the provisions of this section, notwithstanding any other provision of law. Such sentence may not be carried out until final review thereof is had by the Delaware Supreme Court as provided for in subsection (g) of this section. The Court or the Governor may suspend the execution of the sentence until a later date to be specified, solely to permit completion of the process of judicial review of the conviction. If the execution of the sentence of death as provided above is held unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, then punishment of death shall, in all cases, be inflicted by hanging by the neck. The imposition of a sentence of death shall be upon such terms and conditions as the trial court may impose in its sentence, including the place, the number of witnesses and conditions of privacy. Such sentence may not be carried out until final review thereof is had by the Delaware Supreme Court as provided in subsection (g) of this section. The Court or the Governor may suspend the execution of the sentence until a later date to be specified, solely to permit completion of the process of judicial review of the conviction. (g) Automatic review of death penalty by Delaware Supreme Court. \u2014 (1) Whenever the death penalty is imposed, and upon the judgment becoming final in the trial court, the recommendation on and imposition of that penalty shall be reviewed on the record by the Delaware Supreme Court. Absent an appeal having been taken by the defendant upon the expiration of 30 days after the sentence of death has been imposed, the Clerk of the Superior Court shall require a complete transcript of the punishment hearing to be prepared promptly and within 10 days after receipt of that transcript the clerk shall transmit the transcript, together with a notice prepared by the clerk, to the Delaware Supreme Court. The notice shall set forth the title and docket number of the case, the name of the defendant, the name and address of any attorney and a narrative statement of the judgment, the offense and the punishment prescribed. The Court shall, if necessary, appoint counsel to respond to the State's positions in the review proceedings. (2) The Supreme Court shall limit its review under this section to the recommendation on and imposition of the penalty of death and shall determine: a. Whether, considering the totality of evidence in aggravation and mitigation which bears upon the particular circumstances or details of the offense and the character and propensities of the offender, the death penalty was either arbitrarily or capriciously imposed or recommended, or disproportionate to the penalty recommended or imposed in similar cases arising under this section. b. Whether the evidence supports the jury's or the judge's finding of a statutory aggravating circumstance as enumerated in subsection (e) of this section and, where applicable, \u00a7 636(a)(2)-(6) of this title. (3) The Supreme Court shall permit the defendant and the State to submit briefs within the time provided by the Court, and permit them to present oral argument to the Court. (4) With regard to review of the sentence in accordance with this subsection, the Court shall: a. Affirm the sentence of death. b. Set aside the sentence of death and remand for correction of any errors occurring during the hearing and for imposition of the appropriate penalty. Such errors shall not affect the determination of guilt and shall not preclude the reimposition of death where appropriately determined after a new hearing on punishment. c. Set forth its findings as to the reasons for its actions. (h) Ordinary review not affected by section. \u2014 Any error in the guilt phase of the trial may be raised as provided by law and rules of court and shall be in addition to the review of punishment provided by this section.

(1) The arresting officer shall leave a summons for such intoxicated person with the chief medical officer of the detoxification center ordering such intoxicated person to appear before a justice of the peace at a date not to exceed a period of 5 days from the date of admission to the center. (2) The intoxicated person shall be given a physical examination to determine the possible existence of any disease or ailment which threatens the health or safety of such individual; and upon a finding of any such disease or ailment, the medical staff of the detoxification center shall give such treatment as it deems necessary and practicable. (b) Upon regaining sobriety and being informed of the person's physical condition, the person in custody shall inform the chief medical officer of the detoxification center as to whether, until such time as the person is to appear for trial, the person wishes to remain a patient or be released from custody. (c) Should the person in custody validly consent to remain as a patient and to undergo testing procedures, the person shall be tested to determine if the person is a chronic alcoholic. A diagnosis of chronic alcoholism shall serve as an affirmative defense to violations of \u00a7 1315 of this title. (d) Should it be shown to the satisfaction of the court that the person accused of intoxication suffers from chronic alcoholism, the person shall be acquitted of the charge of drunkenness and: (1) Released from custody; or (2) Temporarily released from custody under such conditions of treatment as the court may prescribe; such period of temporary release shall not exceed 1 year after which defendant shall be unconditionally released.

Any person treated under \u00a7 4210 of this title shall, any law to the contrary notwithstanding, be responsible for the incurred expenses, and shall be billed for same by the Department of Mental Health.

Habitual criminal; life sentence (a) Any person who has been 2 times convicted of a Title 11 violent felony, or attempt to commit such a violent felony, as defined in \u00a7 4201(c) of this title under the laws of this State, and/or any comparable violent felony as defined by another state, United States or any territory of the United States, and who shall thereafter be convicted of a subsequent Title 11 violent felony, or attempt to commit such a violent felony, as defined in \u00a7 4201(c) of this title, or any person who has been 3 times convicted of any felony under the laws of this State, and/or any other state, United States or any territory of the United States, and who shall thereafter be convicted of a subsequent felony is declared to be an habitual criminal. The court, upon the State's petition, shall impose the applicable minimum sentence pursuant to subsection (b), (c) or (d) of this section and may, in its discretion, impose a sentence of up to life imprisonment, unless the felony conviction allows and results in the imposition of capital punishment. Under no circumstances may the sentence imposed pursuant to this section be less than the minimum sentence provided for by the felony prompting the person's designation as a habitual offender. (b) Any person who has been 3 times convicted of a felony under the laws of this State, and/or any other state, United States or any territory of the United States, and who shall thereafter be convicted of a subsequent felony, which is the person's first Title 11 violent felony, or attempt to commit such a violent felony, as defined in \u00a7 4201(c) of this title, shall receive a minimum sentence of 1/2 of the statutory maximum penalty provided elsewhere in this title, unless the maximum statutory penalty is life in which case the minimumTitle 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 276sentence shall be 30 years, for the subsequent felony which forms the basis of the States petition to have the person declared to be an habitual criminal, up to life imprisonment, unless the felony conviction allows and results in the imposition of capital punishment. (c) Any person who has been 2 times convicted of a felony under the laws of this State, and/or any other state, United States or any territory of the United States, and 1 time convicted of a Title 11 violent felony, or attempt to commit such a violent felony, as defined in \u00a7 4201(c) of this title under the laws of this State, and/or any comparable violent felony as defined by another state, United States or any territory of the United States, and who shall thereafter be convicted of a subsequent Title 11 violent felony, or attempt to commit such a violent felony, as defined by \u00a7 4201(c) of this title, shall receive a minimum sentence of the statutory maximum penalty provided elsewhere in this title for the fourth or subsequent felony which forms the basis of the State's petition to have the person declared to be an habitual criminal, up to life imprisonment, unless the felony conviction allows and results in the imposition of capital punishment. (d) Any person who has been 2 times convicted of a Title 11 violent felony, or attempt to commit such a violent felony, as defined in \u00a7 4201(c) of this title under the laws of this State, and/or any comparable violent felony as defined by another state, United States or any territory of the United States, and who shall thereafter be convicted of a third or subsequent felony which is a Title 11 violent felony, or an attempt to commit such a violent felony, as defined in \u00a7 4201(c), shall receive a minimum sentence of the statutory maximum statutory penalty provided elsewhere in this title for the third or subsequent Title 11 violent felony which forms the basis of the State's petition to have the person declared to be an habitual criminal, up to life imprisonment, unless the felony conviction allows and results in the imposition of capital punishment. (e) Notwithstanding any provision of this title to the contrary, any minimum sentence required to be imposed pursuant to subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section shall not be subject to suspension by the court, and shall be served in its entirety at full custodial Level V institutional setting without the benefit of probation or parole, except that any such sentence shall be subject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 4205(h), 4381 and 4382 of this title. For purposes of the computation of good time under \u00a7 4381 of this title, a life sentence imposed pursuant only to this section shall equate to a sentence of 45 years. (f) Notwithstanding any statute, court rule or regulation to the contrary, beginning January 1, 2017, any person sentenced as an habitual criminal to a minimum sentence of not less than the statutory maximum penalty for a violent felony pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, or a life sentence pursuant to subsection (b) of this section prior to July 19, 2016, shall be eligible to petition the Superior Court for sentence modification after the person has served a sentence of incarceration equal to any applicable mandatory sentence otherwise required by this section or the statutes describing said offense or offenses, whichever is greater. Absent extraordinary circumstances, the petitioner may only file 1 application for sentence modification under this section. A Superior Court Judge upon consideration of a petition filed pursuant to this subsection may modify, reduce or suspend such petitioner's sentence, excepting any minimum or mandatory sentence required by this section or the statutes describing said offense or offenses. If a Superior Court Judge modifies such petitioner's sentence, the Judge may impose a suspended sentence that includes a probationary term. Nothing in this section, however, shall require the Court to grant such a petitioner a sentence modification pursuant to this section. For the purposes of this subsection, the \"applicable mandatory sentence'' shall be calculated by reference to the penalties prescribed for the relevant offense or offenses by this Code as of July 19, 2016, unless said offense has been repealed, in which case the penalties prescribed by this Code at the time of the act repealing said offense shall be controlling. The Superior Court shall establish rules to implement this subsection which are consistent with the statute, and those rules shall also provide that all petitions filed pursuant to this subsection where the felony establishing an inmate as a habitual offender was a Title 16 offense are heard first, followed by all petitions filed pursuant to this subsection where the felony establishing an inmate as a habitual offender was a crime against property, followed by all other petitions. Nothing in the rules or this subsection shall prohibit the Superior Court from hearing any petition without regard to this preferred sequence when the Department of Justice, through the personal authorization of the Attorney General, Chief Deputy Attorney General, State Prosecutor, or the Chief Prosecutor of a particular county, in response to a request authorized by the Chief Defender, Chief Deputy Defender, or Chief Conflicts Counsel, or private counsel if a petitioner is not represented by the Office of Defense Services, consents to the hearing of that petition and the Superior Court determines it is in the interest of justice to do so. The rules shall also provide for an initial review, including review of a formal response by the Department of Justice after consulting with the victim or victims, of sentence modification petitions involving crimes against persons or property, for the purpose of ensuring that victims are not inconvenienced by petitions that should be denied based upon the documents submitted; in cases not denied in this manner, all victims shall be given an opportunity to be heard. The Superior Court's review of any petitions filed pursuant to this subsection shall include a review of the applicant's prior criminal history, including arrests and convictions, a review of the applicant's conduct while incarcerated, and available evidence as to the likelihood that the applicant will reoffend if released, including a formal, recent risk assessment. The Superior Court shall articulate on the record the results of its review and its rationale for granting or denying a petition. In all cases where sentence modifications are granted, modified sentences should provide for step-down provisions to ensure successful reintegration of persons into the community. By January 1, 2017, the Department of Correction shall notify any criminal defendant whose Level V sentence was imposed under a statutory sentencing regimen which was subsequently changed in a manner that reduced the sentence applicable to the defendant's convictions, including any criminal defendant who received a minimum mandatory sentence that no longer exists by virtue of the enactment of 80 Del. Laws, c. 28. The Department of Correction shall similarly notify the attorney of record, and if the attorney of record is unavailable to receive notice, the Office of Defense Services. (11 Del.

Sentence of greater punishment because of previous conviction. (a) If at the time of sentence, it appears to the court that the conviction of a defendant constitutes a second or other conviction making the defendant liable to a punishment greater than the maximum which may be imposed upon a person not so previously convicted, the court shall fully inform the defendant as to such previous conviction or convictions and shall call upon the defendant to admit or deny such previous conviction or convictions. If the defendant shall admit the previous conviction or convictions, the court may impose the greater punishment. If the defendant shall stand silent or if the defendant shall deny the prior conviction or convictions, the defendant shall be tried upon the issue of previous conviction; provided, however, that the foregoing procedure shall not apply in cases of fourth offenders liable to sentence of life imprisonment under \u00a7 4214 of this title. (b) If, at any time after conviction and before sentence, it shall appear to the Attorney General or to the Superior Court that, by reason of such conviction and prior convictions, a defendant should be subjected to \u00a7 4214 of this title, the Attorney General shall file a motion to have the defendant declared an habitual criminal under \u00a7 4214 of this title. If it shall appear to the satisfaction of the Court at a hearing on the motion that the defendant falls within \u00a7 4214 of this title, the Court shall enter an order declaring the defendant an habitual criminal and shall impose sentence accordingly.

Sentence of greater punishment because of previous conviction under prior law or the laws of other jurisdictions. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, if a previous conviction for a specified offense would make the defendant liable to a punishment greater than that which may be imposed upon a person not so convicted, that previous conviction shall make the defendant liable to the greater punishment if that previous conviction was: (1) For an offense specified in the laws of this State or for an offense which is the same as, or equivalent to, such offense as the same existed and was defined under the laws of this State existing at the time of such conviction; or (2) For an offense specified in the laws of any other state, local jurisdiction, the United States, any territory of the United States, any federal or military reservation, or the District of Columbia which is the same as, or equivalent to, an offense specified in the laws of this State. (b) This section shall apply to any offense or sentencing provision defined in this Code unless the statute defining such offense or sentencing provision or a statute directly related thereto expressly provides that this section is not applicable to such offense or sentencing provision. (74 Del. Laws, c. 62, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 4216. Transition provisions. (a) Where an inmate is serving a sentence to Level V (incarceration) imposed not under the Truth in Sentencing Act of 1989 and receives a subsequent sentence to Level V under the provisions of the Truth in Sentencing Act, serving of the earlier sentence shall be suspended and the inmate shall serve the new Level V sentence until it is completed and then resume serving the original sentence. (b) Where an inmate is serving a \"nonmandatory\" Level V (incarceration) sentence and is subsequently sentenced to a mandatory term of incarceration, serving of the earlier sentence shall be suspended and the inmate shall serve the new mandatory Level V sentence until it is completed and then resume serving the earlier sentence. (c) Where an inmate is serving Level V (incarceration) sentence or sentences imposed not under the Truth in Sentencing Act of 1989, and is subsequently sentenced to Level V under the provisions of the Truth in Sentencing Act and had less than an aggregate 3 years remaining on the prior sentence or sentences, the court at the time of sentencing under the Truth in Sentencing Act may in its discretion suspend the remainder of the prior non-Truth in Sentencing Level V sentence or sentences, unless such sentence was a statutory mandatory term. (d) Any individual convicted of a crime on or after January 1, 1990, which crime occurred prior to June 30, 1990, may elect to be sentenced under the provisions of the Truth in Sentencing Act of 1989 rather than under the prior provisions of this title.

(a) In any case where the trial court has imposed an aggregate sentence of incarceration at Level V in excess of 1 year, the court shall retain jurisdiction to modify the sentence to reduce the level of custody or time to be served under the provisions of this section. (b) The court may modify the sentence solely on the basis of an application filed by the Department of Correction for good cause shown which certifies that the release of the defendant shall not constitute a substantial risk to the community or the defendant's own self. (c) Good cause under this section shall include, but not be limited to, rehabilitation of the offender, serious medical illness or infirmity of the offender and prison overcrowding.Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 278(d) (1) Any application filed by the Department of Correction under this section shall be filed with the Board of Parole. The Board of Parole shall have the authority to promulgate reasonable regulations concerning the form and content of said applications. The Board of Parole may require the Department of Correction to provide it with any information in the possession of the Department reasonably necessary for the Board to assess such applications. (2) Following the receipt of any application for modification filed by the Department of Correction which conforms with any regulations and requirements of the Board of Parole promulgated pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Board of Parole shall hold a hearing under the provisions of \u00a7 4350(a) of this title for the purpose of making a recommendation to the trial court as to the approval or disapproval of the application. This hearing shall not be held unless written notice of the hearing is provided to the Attorney General's office at least 30 days prior to scheduled hearing date.

(f) If a victim or other person identified in subsection (e) of this section is deceased; is a child; is under a mental, physical or legal disability; or is otherwise unable to provide the information required under this section, such information may be obtained from the personal representative, guardian, committee, family member, treatment professional, child protection agency or such other involved state agency as the presentence officer may deem necessary. (g) The provisions of this section relating to victim impact statements shall apply only to those victims who have cooperated with the court and with Investigative Services officers. The provisions of this section relating to victim impact statements shall apply to all courts having original jurisdiction to hear, try and finally determine criminal offenses; provided, however, that such provisions shall not apply to Justices of the Peace Courts. (h) Notwithstanding any statute, rule or regulation to the contrary, upon conviction of any person for any sexual offense, as defined in \u00a7 761 of this title, and upon request of either party, the court shall direct that a presentence report be prepared by a presentence officer. (i) In any case involving a felony conviction for which a presentence investigation is being conducted, the person conducting the investigation shall (1) provide the convicted felon with a copy of \u00a7 1448 of this title and (2) attempt to determine if the convicted felon is in possession of any firearms in violation of \u00a7 1448 of this title.

Imposition of community service. (a) A court may impose a period of community service, as defined in this chapter, either as a condition of probation or as the sole sanction imposed at sentencing. (b) The specified number of hours of community service shall be fixed by the court, but in no case shall the total number of hours imposed exceed the maximum term of incarceration provided by law for the instant offense. In cases where no incarceration is provided by law, the number of hours of community service fixed by the court shall not exceed 100. (c) In the event that community service is imposed by the court as a condition of probation, noncompliance with the community service order shall constitute a violation of the conditions of probation.

(e) The Department shall, by the promulgation of regulations or other appropriate standards, administer and enforce the terms of all court orders involving the imposition of community service. (67 Del. Laws, c. 316, \u00a7 2.) \u00a7 4333. Period of probation or suspension of sentence; termination. (a) The period of probation or suspension of sentence shall be fixed by the court subject to the provisions of this section. Any probation or suspension of sentence may be terminated by the court at any time and upon such termination or upon termination by expiration of the term, an order to this effect shall be entered by the court.

(c) Any offender who is serving more than 1 sentence imposed following convictions in more than 1 case shall not serve a consecutive period of probation or suspension of sentence that is in excess of the limitations imposed by subsection (b) of this section. Any sentence of probation or suspension of sentence (or any portion thereof) which, if served consecutively to another such sentence, would result in an aggregate sentence of probation or suspension of sentence in excess of the limitations imposed by subsection (b) of this section shall be deemed to be concurrent to such other sentence. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to a sentence imposed for a conviction involving an offense committed while the offender was serving a period of probation or suspension of sentence. (d) The limitations set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall not apply: (1) To any sentence imposed for a conviction of any sex offense as defined in \u00a7 761 of this title if the sentencing court determines on the record that a longer period of probation or suspension of sentence will reduce the likelihood that the offender will commit a sex offense or other violent offense in the future; (2) To any sentence imposed for any violent felony in this title as designated by \u00a7 4201(c) of this title if the sentencing court determines on the record that public safety will be enhanced by a longer period of probation or suspension of sentence; or (3) To any sentence imposed for any offense set forth in the Delaware Code if the sentencing court determines on the record that a longer period of probation or suspension of sentence is necessary to ensure the collection of any restitution ordered, except that anyTitle 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 286period of probation ordered pursuant to this paragraph that is in excess of the limitations set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be served at Accountability Level I \u2014 Restitution Only pursuant to the terms of \u00a7 4204(c)(10) of this title. (e) The limitations set forth in subsection (b) and (c) of this section may be exceeded by up to 90 days by the sentencing court if it determines that the defendant has not yet completed a substance abuse treatment program ordered by the court, provided, that each extension of sentence ordered pursuant to this subsection shall be preceded by a hearing, and by a finding on the record, that such extension of sentence is necessary to facilitate the completion of the substance abuse treatment program. (f) Except as provided by subsection (g) of this section, in no event shall the total period of probation or suspension of sentence exceed the maximum term of commitment provided by law for the offense or 1 year, whichever is greater; provided, that in all cases where no commitment is provided by law the period of probation or suspension of sentence shall not be more than 1 year. (g) (1) Any period of custodial supervision imposed pursuant to \u00a7 4204(l) of this title shall not be subject to the limitations set forth by this section. (2) As used in this section, the phrase \"period of probation or suspension of sentence\" shall not include any period of a sentence that is designated by the sentencing court to be served at Supervision Accountability Level IV as defined in \u00a7 4204(c)(4) of this title. (h) Notwithstanding any provision of this Code or court rule to the contrary, any superior court judge who is presiding over any proceeding at which an offender is sentenced or found to have violated any condition or term of an imposed period of probation or suspension of sentence shall be deemed to have jurisdiction over any sentence to a period of probation or suspension of sentence currently being served by the offender regardless of the court or county in which such sentence was originally imposed, and may modify, revoke or terminate any such period of probation or suspension of sentence. (i) The Department shall have the authority without leave of the court to reclassify any offender sentenced to probation at Accountability Levels I, II or III, provided that the Department shall first evaluate the offender using an objective classification tool designed to assist in the determination of the appropriate level of probation. Offenders shall be reevaluated and reclassified periodically as the Department deems necessary and appropriate. (j) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, the provisions of subsections (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this section shall be applicable to sentences imposed prior to June 1, 2003, only upon an order of the Court entered for good cause shown after its consideration of an application for sentence modification filed by the Department of Correction. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 4334; 54 Del. Laws, c. 349, \u00a7 7; 74 Del. Laws, c. 27, \u00a7 4; 74 Del. Laws, c. 88, \u00a7\u00a7 1-4; 74 Del. Laws, c. 345, \u00a7 1; 78 Del. Laws, c. 392, \u00a7 5.) \u00a7 4334. Arrest for violation of conditions; subsequent disposition. (a) The court may issue a warrant for the arrest of a probationer for violation of any of the conditions of probation or suspension of sentence, or a notice to appear to answer to a charge of violation. Such notice shall be personally served upon the probationer. The warrant shall authorize officers to return the probationer to the custody of the court or to the Department. (b) The Commissioner, or any probation officer, when in the Commissioner's or probation officer's judgment there has been a violation of any condition of probation or suspension of sentence, may arrest such probationer without a warrant, or may deputize any other officer with power of arrest to do so by giving that officer a written statement setting forth that the probationer has, in the judgment of the Commissioner or probation officer, violated the conditions of probation or suspended sentence. The written statement delivered with the probationer by the arresting officer to the official in charge of the place of detention shall be sufficient warrant for the detention of the probationer. When an arrest is made by a probation officer, the Department shall present to the detaining authority a written statement of the circumstances of violation. Provisions regarding release on bail of persons charged with crime shall be applicable to the probationers arrested under these provisions. (c) Upon such arrest and detention, the Department shall immediately notify the court and shall submit in writing a report showing in what manner the probationer has violated the conditions of probation or suspension of sentence. Thereupon, or upon arrest by warrant as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the court shall cause the probationer to be brought before it without unnecessary delay, for a hearing on the violation charge. The hearing may be informal or summary. If the violation is established, the court may continue or revoke the probation or suspension of sentence, and may require the probation violator to serve the sentence imposed, or any lesser sentence, and, if imposition of sentence was suspended, may impose any sentence which might originally have been imposed. (d) Notwithstanding any provision of subsection (c) of this section or any other law, rule or regulation to the contrary, the Department is authorized to administratively resolve technical and minor violations of the conditions of probation or supervision at Accountability Levels I, II, III or IV when a sanction less restrictive than Level V is being sought by the Department as a result of the violation, and is further authorized to administratively resolve technical and minor violations of conditions of probation at Accountability Levels I, II, III, or IV by placing the probationer at Accountability Level IV for a period of not more than 5 days consecutively, and not more than 10 days in any 1 calendar year, or on home confinement for a period of not more than 10 days consecutively, and not more than 20 days per calendar year. The Department shall adopt written procedures providing for administrative review for all cases in which an offender is placed at Level IV or home confinement pursuant to this subsection. All administrative dispositions imposed pursuant to this subsection shall be documented in the offender's record and shall be made available to the court in the event of a subsequent violation which is considered by the court. For the purposes of this subsection, the term \"technical and minor violations of the conditions of probation orTitle 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 287supervision\" shall not include arrests or convictions for new criminal offenses. Under this section, the purpose of home confinement is to reduce the number of persons held at Level V and Level IV facilities by substituting home confinement when appropriate. The Department shall develop guidelines for probation officers to assist them in providing consistent and appropriate responses to compliance and violations of the conditions of probation or supervision. (e) A probationer for whose return a warrant cannot be served, shall be deemed a fugitive from justice or to have fled from justice. If it shall appear that probationer has violated probation or suspended sentence, the court shall determine whether the time from issuing of the warrant to the date of the probationer's arrest, or any part of it, shall be counted as time served on probation or suspended sentence. (f) The Justice of the Peace Court shall have jurisdiction over violations of probation where such probation or suspension of sentence was pursuant to an order of the Justice of the Peace Court.

When a person in legal custody of the Department of Correction applies to the Board of Pardons for recommendation for a pardon or commutation of sentence, the Parole Board, upon request, shall furnish to each member of the Board of Pardons and to the Governor a report of the record of such person, which shall include its opinion as to the state of rehabilitation of such person. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 4343; 54 Del. Laws, c. 349, \u00a7 7; 57 Del. Laws, c. 597, \u00a7 3; 60 Del. Laws, c. 251, \u00a7 10; 78 Del. Laws, c. 305, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 4344. Compensation and expenses. (a) Each member of the Board except the Chairperson shall receive $300 per day, for services when attending a meeting of the Board. The meetings of the Board shall not exceed 50 in any year; however, the Governor may, in the Governor's discretion, give written authorization to the Board to hold as many meetings in excess of 50 in any year as the business of the Board may require. (b) In addition, each member shall receive mileage incurred attending such meetings and performing such duties. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 4344; 54 Del. Laws, c. 349, \u00a7 7; 57 Del. Laws, c. 597, \u00a7 4; 58 Del. Laws, c. 145; 59 Del. Laws, c. 172, \u00a7 3; 62 Del. Laws, c. 68, \u00a7 138; 62 Del. Laws, c. 86, \u00a7 40; 65 Del. Laws, c. 348, \u00a7 89; 69 Del. Laws, c. 459, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 74 Del. Laws, c. 329, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 4345. Information on applications for parole and review to be provided by Chairperson. At least 14 days before any meeting of the Board, the Chairperson shall provide all the members of the Board with copies of all pertinent information and materials at the Chairperson's disposal concerning all applications for parole coming before the Board at that meeting, or concerning any reviews which shall be undertaken at that meeting. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 4345; 57 Del. Laws, c. 597, \u00a7 5; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 4346. Eligibility for parole. (a) A person confined to any correctional facility administered by the Department may be released on parole by the Board if the person has served 1/3 of the term imposed by the court, such term to be reduced by such merit and good behavior credits as have been earned, or 120 days, whichever is greater. For the purpose of this subchapter, \"court\" shall include any court committing an offender to the Department. (b) Consistent with law, the Board, upon written recommendation of the court which imposed the sentence, or the Department, may reduce the minimum term of eligibility when the Board is satisfied that the best interest of the public and the welfare of the person will be served by such reduction. Such reduction in the minimum term of eligibility for parole shall be by order of the Board stating the specific date when said person shall become eligible for parole; but such reduction of the minimum term of eligibility for parole shall have no effect on the maximum limits of the sentence. The order of reduction by the Board shall be made in open hearing. (c) The Board shall have authority to act where the maximum term has been commuted by the Governor. For all purposes of this section, a person sentenced to imprisonment for life shall be considered as having been sentenced to a fixed term of 45 years. (d) Consistent with law, the Board may adopt such other rules as it deems proper or necessary with respect to the eligibility of persons for parole, the conduct of parole hearings or conditions to be imposed upon parolees. (e) Whenever the physical or mental condition of any person confined in any institution demands treatment which the Department cannot furnish, the Department may, if such action seems necessary for the well-being of such person, recommend the case be considered by the Board of Parole at a regular or special meeting. When such case is so considered, the Board of Parole, if satisfied that removal from the institution is necessary for the well-being of such person, may order the release of such person on parole without regard to the time already served by such person. The Board of Parole shall parole in such case only when arrangements have been made for the treatment of the person in some institution. The Board of Parole may impose any conditions of parole in such case, may revoke such parole without hearing at any time and for any cause, and order the return of the person to the Department. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 4346; 54 Del. Laws, c. 349, \u00a7 7.)Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 291\u00a7 4347. Parole authority and procedure. (a) A person committed to the custody of the Department who will be eligible for parole within 180 days may apply for a parole hearing on forms promulgated by the Board. Upon receipt of such application, the Board shall notify the Bureau Chief of Prisons of said application and request verification of parole eligibility and the information required in subsection (d) of this section which shall be provided the Board within 30 days. Upon receipt of the foregoing information, the Board shall determine within 30 days if a parole hearing will be scheduled. If the hearing is denied or if the hearing is held and the parole denied the applicant and the Department shall be advised in writing by the Board of the earliest date, not sooner than 6 months for an applicant with a good-time release date of 3 years or less and not sooner than 1 year for an applicant with a good-time release date of more than 3 years, upon which the applicant shall be eligible to again apply for a parole hearing in accordance within this section. (b) If any person eligible for parole fails to make an application as specified in subsection (a) of this section, the Department shall have no duty to such person to provide the Board with the information otherwise required by this chapter and the Board shall have no duty to such person to consider such person for parole. Notwithstanding the failure of a person to apply for parole, the Department is permitted to provide the Board with the information otherwise required by this chapter and the Board may, in turn, consider such person for parole. (c) A parole may be granted when in the opinion of the Board there is reasonable probability that the person can be released without detriment to the community or to person, and where, in the Board's opinion, parole supervision would be in the best interest of society and an aid to rehabilitation of the offender as a law-abiding citizen. A parole shall be ordered only in the best interest of society, not as an award of clemency, and shall not be considered as a reduction of sentence or a pardon. A person shall be placed on parole only when the Board believes that the person is able and willing to fulfill the obligations of a law-abiding citizen. Among the factors the Board shall consider when determining if a defendant shall be placed on parole are as follows: job skills, progress towards or achievement of a general equivalency diploma, substance abuse treatment and anger management and conflict resolution. (d) Within 1 month prior to the time an offender is scheduled for a parole hearing, the Department shall submit a progress report with parole recommendations to the Parole Board, and the Department shall submit a carefully evaluated parole plan with recommendations. At the same time a copy of the progress report and the parole plan and recommendations shall also be submitted to the Delaware State Police and to the arresting public police organization, along with the date and location of the scheduled parole hearing. Moreover, whenever possible and feasible, the Department shall notify the aggrieved party of the crime or crimes for which the offender was sentenced and the date and location of the scheduled parole hearing. (e) The Board shall have no obligation to allow a person eligible for parole to appear before it, and the Board may deny a parole application without having interviewed the applicant. In no case, however, shall the Board grant a parole without having first had the applicant personally appear before the Board and be interviewed by it. (f) All paroles shall issue upon order of the Board duly adopted by a majority of those present and voting; provided, however, no person who has been convicted of and imprisoned for murder in the first or second degree, rape in the first, second or third degree, unlawful sexual intercourse in the first or second degree, kidnapping or any offense relating to the sale, attempt to sell, delivery or possession with intent to sell or deliver a narcotic drug shall be granted a parole except by order of the Board duly adopted by at least 4 of the 5 members of the Board. A quorum shall be a minimum of 3 members. No parole shall be issued to any prisoner who has been convicted in a court of law and sentenced for committing or attempting to commit the offense of \"escape after conviction\" as set forth in \u00a7 1253 of this title until such time as that prisoner has served the amount of time equivalent to and commensurate with that imposed in the sentence set forth by the court for said escape or attempt to escape. No parole shall be issued to any prisoner who has been convicted and sentenced in a court of law for the offense of \"conspiracy in the second degree\" as defined in \u00a7 512 of this title with respect to directly and actively aiding or abetting an escape as defined in \u00a7 1253 of this title until such time as an equivalent amount of time commensurate with that which has been imposed under the sentence set forth by the court for said conspiracy has been served. (g) Every person while on parole shall remain in the legal custody of the Department but shall be subject to the orders of the Board of Parole. (h) Where civil rights would otherwise be forfeited, they shall be forfeited only during any period of incarceration. (i) The period served on parole or conditional release shall be deemed service of the term of imprisonment, and subject to the provisions contained in \u00a7 4352 of this title, relating to a person who is a fugitive from or has fled from justice, the total time served may not exceed the maximum term or sentence. When a person on parole or conditional release has performed the obligations of that person's release for such time as shall satisfy the Board that the person's final release is not incompatible with the best interest of society and the welfare of the individual, the Board may make a final order of discharge and issue a certificate of discharge to the person; but no such order of discharge shall be made within 1 year after the date of release except where the sentence expires earlier thereto. Such discharge, and the discharge of a person who has served person's term of imprisonment, shall have the effect of restoring all civil rights lost by operation of law upon commitment. Except when discharged herein a person on parole or conditional release shall be on parole until the expiration of the maximum term for which the person is sentenced. (j) Each person who is eligible for parole or conditional release under this subchapter is eligible to be a candidate for appointment to the house arrest program for nonviolent offenders. A person shall be eligible for consideration to participate in the house arrest program if such person meets all of the requirements of subsection (c) of this section and in addition:Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 292(1) Makes regular payments, per month, toward the costs incurred by the State in maintaining the program; (2) Performs such stipulated number of hours of public service work as are directed by the court or by the Department; (3) Makes restitution to any victim or victims in such amounts as the court shall determine. Full or partial restitution, in such manner as the court determines, is a requirement for participation, or continued participation, in the program. (k) Notification of parole eligibility. \u2014 (1) At least 30 days prior to a scheduled parole hearing for an inmate convicted of a felony offense, the Board shall notify the victim or the immediate family of the victim of the date, time and place of the scheduled hearing. A copy of any rules developed pursuant to \u00a7 4350(a) of this title shall be included with the notice. However, at any time, the victim or the victim's immediate family can request that no notification be sent. (2) At least 30 days prior to a scheduled parole hearing for an inmate convicted of a felony offense, the Board shall send a notice of the date, time and place of the scheduled hearing to the attorney general. (3) At least 30 days prior to a scheduled parole hearing for an inmate convicted of a felony offense, the Board shall cause notice of the date, time and place of the scheduled hearing to be published in a newspaper with an average daily statewide circulation of at least 15,000 copies, of which at least 5,000 copies shall be in the county in which the offense occurred. (l) Notification of parole decision. \u2014 (1) At the same time as the Board sends notice of its decision to the inmate, the Board shall send notice of its decision to those who received notice under paragraphs (k)(1) and/or (2) of this section. (2) No later than 10 days after a parole hearing resulting in parole of an applicant, the Board shall cause notice of its decision to be published in the same newspaper in which the notice of the hearing was published. (m) Prior to a parole hearing, a party to whom the Board failed to notify as required in paragraphs (k)(1) or (2) of this section may request that the Board postpone the scheduled hearing in order to provide a reasonable opportunity for the party to attend the hearing, and/ or submit a written statement. However, in no event shall the hearing be postponed more than 45 days from the original scheduled date. (n) Any notice required to be provided to the victim or to the victim's immediate family shall be mailed to the last known address of the victim or family member. It is the responsibility of the victim or the victim's immediate family to provide the Board with a current mailing address. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 4347; 54 Del. Laws, c. 349, \u00a7 7; 57 Del.

A person released on or after August 8, 2012, having served that person's term or terms in incarceration, less such merit and good behavior credits as have been earned, shall, upon release, be deemed as released on probation until the expiration of the maximum term or terms for which the person is sentenced. A person may waive the right to conditional release, in which case the person shall serve the remainder of the term or terms in prison. Such waiver shall be in writing. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 4348; 54 Del. Laws, c. 349, \u00a7 7; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 78 Del. Laws, c. 392, \u00a7 7; 79 Del. Laws, c. 187, \u00a7 3.) \u00a7 4349. Information from the Department and others. The Department shall grant to the Board or its representatives access to any person over whom the Board has jurisdiction under this chapter, and shall provide facilities for communicating with and observing such person, and make available to the Board such reports as the Board shall require concerning the conduct and character of any person in the custody of the Department, the institutional plan of treatment for such person or any other facts deemed by the Board pertinent in determining whether the person shall be paroled. The Department shall furnish to the Board such reports as the Board shall require concerning casework performed in the community with relatives or others connected with the person, investigations of parole plans or other reports or facts deemed by the Board pertinent in determining whether or not the person shall be paroled. All police agencies of this State, upon request, shall furnish the Board with any information at their disposal in regard to any person to be considered for parole. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 4349; 54 Del. Laws, c. 349, \u00a7 7.) \u00a7 4350. Conduct of hearings on applications for parole. (a) The Board shall adopt rules for hearing oral statements or arguments by persons not connected with the Department of Correction when hearing applications for parole. In developing those rules, the Board shall reserve for itself the right to: (1) Limit the length of each statement; (2) Restrict the number of individuals allowed to attend parole hearings in accordance with physical limitations or security requirements of the hearing facilities; and (3) Deny admission or continued attendance to individuals who threaten or present a danger to the attendees or participants or who disrupt the hearing. The Board shall also accept written statements. (b) The Board may take formal action to close their proceedings upon a majority vote of members present for the following reasons:Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 293(1) To protect ongoing law-enforcement investigations, upon written request of the attorney general or law-enforcement agency; (2) To deliberate upon oral or written arguments received; (3) To provide opportunity for applicants to challenge confidential information which they believe is detrimental to their applications; or (4) At the request of the victim or, in the case of first-degree murder, the immediate family of the victim. (c) The Department of Correction may appear personally before the Board to advise and be heard by the Board with respect to any application for parole being considered. (d) When the Board is hearing an application for parole made by an offender, the victim or immediate family of the victim of such crime or their duly appointed representatives may make oral statements or arguments before the Board with respect to the application for parole being considered. Victims or their representatives shall have priority in making statements before the Board. (e) As used in this section, the phrase \"immediate family\" shall mean widow, widower, parents, children, brothers and sisters of the victim. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 4350; 54 Del. Laws, c. 349, \u00a7 7; 60 Del. Laws, c. 64, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 168, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 4351. Witnesses; production of records. The Board may issue subpoenas requiring the attendance of such witnesses and the production of such records, books, papers and documents necessary for investigation of the case of any person before it. Subpoenas may be signed and oaths administered by any member of the Board. Subpoenas so issued may be served by Department employees or by any person authorized to serve subpoenas by the Rules of Civil Procedure of the Superior Court and shall be served and returned as provided by said Rules. The fees of witnesses shall be the same as allowed in the Superior Court and shall be paid by the State Treasurer from any moneys in the Treasury of the State not otherwise appropriated, upon a warrant signed by a member of the Board and its Secretary. Any person who testifies falsely or fails to appear when subpoenaed, or refuses to produce such material pursuant to the subpoena, shall be subject to the same orders and penalties to which a person before said Court is subject. The Superior Court, upon application of the Board, may in its discretion compel the attendance of witnesses, the production of such material and the giving of testimony before the Board, by an attachment for contempt or otherwise in the same manner as production of evidence may be compelled before such Superior Court. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 4351; 54 Del. Laws, c. 349, \u00a7 7.) \u00a7 4352. Return of violator of parole; procedure and action on violation. (a) At any time during release on parole the Board or any member thereof may issue a warrant for the arrest of a released person for violation of any of the conditions of release, or a notice to appear to answer to a charge of violation. Such notice shall be served personally upon the person. The warrant shall authorize any officer authorized to serve process in this State to return the person to the actual custody of the correctional facility from which the person was released, or to any other suitable detention facility designated by the Board or Department. When, in the judgment of the Commissioner or of any probation and parole officer, there has been a violation of the conditions of release, the Commissioner or the probation and parole officer may arrest such parolee without a warrant, or the Commissioner or the probation and parole officer may deputize any other officer with power of arrest to do so by giving officer a written statement setting forth that the parolee has, in the judgment of the Commissioner or probation and parole officer, violated the conditions of parolee's release. The written statement delivered with the person by the arresting officers to the official in charge of the facility to which the person is brought for detention shall be sufficient warrant for detaining the parolee. (b) After making an arrest the Department shall present to the detaining authorities a statement of the circumstances of violation. Pending hearing, as hereinafter provided, upon any charge of violation, the person shall remain incarcerated in the institution. (c) Upon such arrest and detention, the Department shall immediately notify the Board and shall submit a report showing in what manner the person had violated the conditions of release. The Board shall cause the person to be brought promptly before it for a hearing on the violation charge, under such rules and regulations as the Board may adopt. (d) If the violation is established by the hearing, the Board may continue or revoke the parole, or enter such other order as it may see fit. (e) A person for whose return a warrant has been issued by the Board shall, if it is found that the warrant cannot be served, be deemed to be a fugitive from justice or to have fled from justice. (f) If it shall appear that the person has violated the provisions of the person's release, the Board shall determine whether the time from the issuing of the warrant to the date of the person's arrest, or any part of it, shall be counted as time under the sentence. (g) Any person who commits a crime while at large on parole and is convicted and sentenced therefor shall serve the unexpired portion of the term under which the person was released consecutively after any new sentence for the new offense. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 4352; 54 Del. Laws, c. 349, \u00a7 7; 59 Del. Laws, c. 546, \u00a7 1; 67 Del. Laws, c. 442, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 78 Del. Laws, c. 392, \u00a7 8.) \u00a7 4353. Mental health evaluations required prior to parole. (a) No person who has been convicted of and imprisoned for any class A felony, felony sex offense or any felony wherein death or assault to a victim occurred shall be released from incarceration by the Parole Board until the Parole Board has considered a mentalTitle 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 294health evaluation of such person. The Parole Board, in its discretion, may request mental health evaluations on persons convicted and imprisoned for any offense not enumerated above. (b) The Department of Correction shall ensure that mental health evaluations required by subsection (a) of this section are available to the Parole Board at the time of the hearing in those cases wherein a favorable recommendation is made by the Department to the Board. In cases wherein a favorable recommendation is not made by the Department but the Parole Board has determined that the person is otherwise suitable for release on parole, the Parole Board must request a mental health evaluation, pursuant to this section. (c) The Parole Board may consider any mental health evaluation conducted within 12 months prior to the person's parole hearing in lieu of requesting a new mental health evaluation. However, for persons convicted and imprisoned for any of the offenses listed in subsection (a) of this section, the Parole Board may determine that it requires additional information. In such case as additional information is required, no person shall be released from incarceration until such additional information has been considered by the Parole Board. (d) Mental health evaluations conducted pursuant to this section will be administered by a person with professional education and training. The mental health evaluation to the Parole Board shall consist of: (1) Background information or historical information about the person's mental health; (2) Information about the person's functioning in the prison or institutional setting; (3) A description of the person's current mental health; and (4) A summary with a prognosis of expected behavior if the person were paroled, including any specific recommendations for mental health care. (e) Any mental health evaluations prepared pursuant to this section will be provided to each member of the Parole Board for their consideration in determining whether the person should be released from prison. (f) Nothing in this section shall preclude the parole of a person for treatment to another institution because of a physical or mental condition, as provided in \u00a7 4346 of this title. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 4353; 57 Del. Laws, c. 596, \u00a7 1; 66 Del. Laws, c. 269, \u00a7 9; 67 Del. Laws, c. 315, \u00a7 1; 68 Del. Laws, c. 372, \u00a7 1; 69 Del. Laws, c. 336, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 4354. Applicability to sentences imposed pursuant to truth in sentencing. No sentence imposed pursuant to the provisions of the Truth and Sentencing Act of 1989, including sentences imposed for felonies under \u00a7 4177 of Title 21, shall be subject to parole under the provisions of this subchapter. (67 Del. Laws, c. 130, \u00a7 7; 80 Del. Laws, c. 120, \u00a7 2.) Subchapter V Interstate Compact For The Supervision Of Adult Offenders \u00a7 4358. Terms of the compact between the states. The Governor shall execute a compact on behalf of the State with any of the United States legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows: INTERSTATE COMPACT FOR THE SUPERVISION OF ADULT OFFENDERS PREAMBLE * WHEREAS, the interstate compact for the supervision of Parolees and Probationers was established in 1937, it is the earliest corrections \"compact\" established among the states and has not been amended since its adoption over 62 years ago; and * WHEREAS, this compact is the only vehicle for the controlled movement of adult parolees and probationers across state lines, and it currently has jurisdiction over more than a quarter of a million offenders; and * WHEREAS, the complexities of the compact have become more difficult to administer, and many jurisdictions have expanded supervision expectations to include currently unregulated practices such as victim input, victim notification requirements and sex offender registration; and * WHEREAS, after hearings, national surveys, and a detailed study by a task force appointed by the National Institute of Corrections, the overwhelming recommendation has been to amend the document to bring about an effective management capacity that addresses public safety concerns and offender accountability; and * WHEREAS, upon the adoption of this Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision, it is the intention of the legislature to repeal the previous Interstate Compact for the Supervision of Parolees and Probationers on the effective date of this Compact. ARTICLE I PURPOSE The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community who are authorized pursuant to the Bylaws and Rules of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each compacting state in such a manner as to track the location of offenders, transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner, and when necessary return offenders to the originating jurisdictions. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance inTitle 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 295the prevention of crime. It is the purpose of this compact and the Interstate Commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states: to provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community; to provide for the effective tracking, supervision, and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of the compact among the compacting states. In addition, this compact will: create an Interstate Commission which will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections or other criminal justice agencies which will promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this compact; ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of Compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators; monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct non-compliance; and coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity. The compacting states recognize that there is no \"right\" of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this compact and bylaws and rules promulgated hereunder. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.

The Interstate Commission shall meet at least once during each calendar year. The chairperson of the Interstate Commission may call additional meetings at any time and, upon the request of a majority of the Members, shall call additional meetings. The Interstate Commission's By-laws shall establish conditions and procedures under which the Interstate Commission shall make its information and official records available to the public for inspection or copying. The Interstate Commission may exempt from disclosure any information or official record to the extent they would adversely affect personal privacy rights or proprietary interests.

Public notice shall be given of all meetings and all meetings shall be open to the public, except as set forth in the Rules or as otherwise provided in the Compact. The Interstate Commission shall promulgate Rules consistent with the principles contained in the \"Government in Sunshine Act\", 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b), as may be amended.

All Rules and amendments shall become binding as of the date specified in each Rule or amendment. If a majority of the legislatures of the Compacting States rejects a Rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, then such Rule shall have no further force and effect in any Compacting State. When promulgating a Rule, the Interstate Commission shall: * Publish the proposed Rule stating with particularity the text of the Rule which is proposed and the reason for the proposed Rule; * Allow persons to submit written data, facts, opinions and arguments, which information shall be publicly available; * Provide an opportunity for an informal hearing; and * Promulgate a final Rule and its effective date, if appropriate, based on the rulemaking record. Not later than 60 days after a Rule is promulgated, any interested person may file a petition in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the Federal District Court where the Interstate Commission's principal office is located for judicial review of such Rule. If the court finds that the Interstate Commission's action is not supported by substantial evidence, (as defined in the APA), in the rulemaking record, the court shall hold the Rule unlawful and set it aside.Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 299Subjects to be addressed within 12 months after the first meeting must at a minimum include: * Notice to victims and opportunity to be heard; * Offender registration and compliance; * Violations/returns; * Transfer procedures and forms; * Eligibility for transfer; * Collection of restitution and fees from offenders; * Data collection and reporting; * The level of supervision to be provided by the receiving state; * Transition rules governing the operation of the Compact and the Interstate Commission during all or part of the period between the effective date of the Compact and the date on which the last eligible state adopts the Compact; * Mediation, arbitration and dispute resolution.

The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the Interstate Commission, taking into consideration the population of the state and the volume of interstate movement of offenders in each Compacting State and shall promulgate a Rule binding upon all Compacting States which governs said assessment. The Interstate Commission shall not incur any obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same; nor shall the Interstate Commission pledge the credit of any of the Compacting States, except by and with the authority of the Compacting State. The Interstate Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements.

However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Interstate Commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Interstate Commission. ARTICLE XI COMPACTING STATES, EFFECTIVE DATE AND AMENDMENT Any state, as defined in Article II of this compact, is eligible to become a Compacting State.

The initial effective date shall be theTitle 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 300later of July 1, 2001, or upon enactment into law of the Compact into law by that State. The governors of Non-Member states or their designees will be invited to participate in Interstate Commission activities on a non-voting basis prior to adoption of the compact by all states and territories of the United States. Amendments to the Compact may be proposed by the Interstate Commission for enactment by the Compacting States. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the Interstate Commission and the Compacting States unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the Compacting States. ARTICLE XII WITHDRAWAL, DEFAULT, TERMINATION, AND JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT A. Withdrawal. Once effective, the Compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every Compacting State; PROVIDED, that a Compacting State may withdraw from the Compact (\"Withdrawing State\") by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute which enacted the Compact into law. The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal. The Withdrawing State shall immediately notify the Chairperson of the Interstate Commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this Compact in the Withdrawing State. The Interstate Commission shall notify the other Compacting States of the Withdrawing State's intent to withdraw within sixty days of its receipt thereof. The Withdrawing State is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal. Reinstatement following withdrawal of any Compacting State shall occur upon the Withdrawing State re-enacting the Compact or upon such later date as determined by the Interstate Commission. B. Default. If the Interstate Commission determines that any Compacting State has at any time defaulted (\"Defaulting State\") in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact, the By-laws or any duly promulgated Rules the Interstate Commission may impose any or all of the following penalties: * Fines, fees and costs in such amounts as are deemed to be reasonable as fixed by the Interstate Commission; * Remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the Interstate Commission; * Suspension and termination of membership in the compact; * Suspension shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the By-laws and Rules have been exhausted. Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the Governor, the Chief Justice or Chief Judicial Officer of the state; the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the State Council. The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a Compacting State to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this Compact, Interstate Commission By-laws, or duly promulgated Rules. The Interstate Commission shall immediately notify the Defaulting State in writing of the penalty imposed by the Interstate Commission on the Defaulting State pending a cure of the default. The Interstate Commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the Defaulting State must cure its default. If the Defaulting State fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the Interstate Commission, in addition to any other penalties imposed herein, the Defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the Compacting States and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact shall be terminated from the effective date of suspension. Within 60 days of the effective date of termination of a Defaulting State, the Interstate Commission shall notify the Governor, the Chief Justice or Chief Judicial Officer and the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Defaulting State's legislature and the state council of such termination. The Defaulting State is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination. The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to the Defaulting State unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the Interstate Commission and the Defaulting State. Reinstatement following termination of any Compacting State requires both a re- enactment of the Compact by the Defaulting State and the approval of the Interstate Commission pursuant to the Rules. C. Judicial Enforcement. The Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the Members, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the Federal District where the Interstate Commission has its offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact, its duly promulgated Rules and By-laws, against any Compacting State in default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorneys' fees. D. Dissolution of Compact. The Compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the Compacting State which reduces membership in the Compact to one Compacting State.Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 301Upon the dissolution of this Compact, the Compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission shall be wound up and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the By-laws.

The provisions of this Compact shall be liberally constructed to effectuate its purposes. ARTICLE XIV BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS A. Other Laws. Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a Compacting State that is not inconsistent with this Compact. All Compacting States' laws conflicting with this Compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict. B. Binding Effect of the Compact. All lawful actions of the Interstate Commission, including all Rules and By-laws promulgated by the Interstate Commission, are binding upon the Compacting States. All agreements between the Interstate Commission and the Compacting States are binding in accordance with their terms. Upon the request of a party to a conflict over meaning or interpretation of Interstate Commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the Compacting States, the Interstate Commission may issue advisory opinions regarding such meaning or interpretation. In the event any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any Compacting State, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such provision upon the Interstate Commission shall be ineffective and such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the Compacting State and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this Compact becomes effective.

The court may grant a new trial if the person establishes by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable trier of fact, considering the evidence presented at trial, evidence that was available at trial but was not presented or was excluded, and the evidence obtained pursuant to subsection (a) of this section would have convicted the person. (c) The court shall impose reasonable conditions on the testing designed to protect the state's interests in the integrity of the evidence and the testing process. (d) Any motion filed pursuant to this section shall be served upon the State. The State shall have an absolute right to appeal to an appellate court any order granting a motion for a new trial pursuant to this section.

(c) The Rules of Criminal Procedure for the Superior Court adopted and promulgated by the Supreme Court prior to the enactment of this Code shall take effect upon the enactment of this Code. Any amendments of or supplements to such Rules which the Superior Court may hereafter adopt and promulgate shall take effect upon such date as the Superior Court shall fix in its order adopting and promulgating such amendments or supplements.

If the owner of any stolen money cannot be located or fails to claim such stolen money within 1 year from the date that it came into the custody of the State Police, such money shall become the property of the State Police Retirement Fund in the same manner as other sums contributed thereto. If the owner of any lost or abandoned money cannot be located or fails to claim such lost or abandoned money within 1 year from the date that it came into the custody of the State Police, such money shall become the property of the person who delivered custody of such money to the State Police and shall be returned by the Superintendent to such person as soon as is practicable.

Thereafter, pensions of State Police retired by reason of permanent injuries received in the performance of their duties shall not be recomputed based on the salaries of active duty State Police; provided further, however, that members of the State Police retired by reason of injury not received in the performance of their duties or disease prior to January 1, 1972, shall as of that date receive an amount equal to one half of the monthly salary provided under this chapter for an active duty officer of equivalent rank in accordance with \u00a7 8326 of this title. Thereafter, pensions of State Police members retired by reason of injury or disease shall not be recomputed based on the salaries of active duty State Police; provided further, however, that as of July 1, 1974, the monthly amount payable to State Police retired by reason of permanent injuries received in the performance of their duties and by State Police retired by reason of other injury or disease shall increase on July 1 of each year by any cumulative percentage increase in the national consumer price index average of the previous calendar year, plus the aggregated cumulative percentage change in the national consumer price index average of the previous consecutive years in which an increase was not granted. A cumulative percentage decrease in any calendar year shall not result in any reduction in the pension rates. Any member who is entitled to a pension equal to 3/4 of the member's salary pursuant to this section shall be examined by at least 2 competent physicians employed by the Department of Health and Social Services every 6 months in order to determine the continuing eligibility of said member. Should such pensioner reside without the territorial limits of the State, the pensioner shall submit certificates of examination by 2 competent physicians approved by the Department of Health and Human Services or comparable agency of the state of residence for the foregoing purpose.

Such pension to such children shall be discontinued when the youngest living dependent child shall cease to be a dependent as defined by \u00a7 8351(4) of this title. Nothing in this section shall be construed as to conflict with any other section contained within this subchapter; provided, however, that any retired police member entitled to receive a pension under this section prior to January 1, 1972, shall, as of that date, receive an amount equal to one half the monthly salary provided under this chapter for an active duty officer of the same rank as that held by the retired State Police member. Thereafter, pensions of retired State Police members eligible to receive such pensions under this section shall not be recomputed based on the salaries of active duty member of the State Police. A dependent entitled to receive a payment under this section prior to January 1, 1972, shall as of that date receive an amount equal to one half the monthly salary provided under this chapter to an active duty officer of the same rank as the decedent through whom the dependent claims. Thereafter, pensions of dependents eligible to receive payments under this section shall not be recomputed based on the salaries of active duty State Police members. Provided further, that as of July 1, 1974, the monthly amount payable to those eligible to receive payments under this section shall increase on July 1 of each year by any cumulative percentage increase in the national consumer price index average of the previous calendar year, plus the aggregated cumulative percentage change in the national consumer price index average of the previous consecutive years in which an increase was not granted. A cumulative percentage decrease in any calendar year shall not result in any reduction in the pension rates. (11 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 8326; 52 Del. Laws, c. 128; 54 Del.

The contributions so picked up shall be treated as employer contributions for purposes of determining the amounts of federal income taxes to withhold from the member's compensation. (b) Member contributions picked up by the employer shall be paid from the same source of funds used for the payment of compensation to a member. A deduction shall be made from each member's compensation equal to the amount of the member's contributions picked up by the employer.

The employee will not be given the option of choosing to receive the contributed amounts directly instead of having them paid by the employer to the retirement system. (68 Del.

A deduction shall be made from each member's compensation equal to the amount of the member's contributions picked up by the employer. This deduction, however, shall not reduce the member's compensation for purposes of computing benefits under the retirement system pursuant to this chapter. (c) Member contributions shall be credited to a separate account within the member's individual account so that the amount contributed prior to the effective date for the pickup of member contributions may be distinguished from the amounts contributed on or after the effective date.Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 367(d) The contributions, although designated as employee contributions, are being paid by the employer in lieu of the contributions by the employee. The employee will not be given the option of choosing to receive the contributed amounts directly instead of having them paid by the employer to the retirement system. (68 Del. Laws, c. 358, \u00a7 5.) \u00a7 8395. Burial benefits.

Laws, c. 360, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3; 77 Del. Laws, c. 193, \u00a7 1; 77 Del. Laws, c. 204, \u00a7 1; 78 Del. Laws, c. 103, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2; 83 Del. Laws, c. 247, \u00a7 7.) \u00a7 9010. Denial of claim; reduction. (a) The Agency shall deny payment of a claim for any of the following reasons: (1) Where the claimant was the perpetrator of the crime on which the claim is based. (2) Where the victim incurred the personal injury on which the claim is based through collusion with the perpetrator of the crime. (3) Where the victim refused to give reasonable cooperation to state or local law-enforcement agencies in their efforts to apprehend or convict the perpetrator of the crime in question. (4) Where the claim has not been filed within 1 year after the personal injury on which the claim in based, unless an extension is granted by the Agency or the Agency, in its discretion, determines that the circumstances render this requirement unreasonable. (5) Where the victim has failed to report the crime to a law-enforcement agency within 72 hours of its occurrence. This requirement is waived in any of the following circumstances: a.

(7), (8) [Repealed.] (b) In determining whether or not to make an award under this chapter, or in determining the amount of any award, the Agency may consider any circumstances it deems to be relevant, including the behavior of the victim which directly or indirectly contributed to injury or death, unless such injury or death resulted from the victim's lawful attempt to prevent the commission of a crime or to apprehend an offender. (c) If the victim bears any share of responsibility that caused injury or death, the Agency shall reduce the amount of compensation in accordance with its assessment of the degree of such responsibility attributable to the victim. A claim may be denied or reduced if the victim of the personal injury in question, either through negligence or through wilful and unlawful conduct, substantially provoked or aggravated the incident giving rise to the injury. (d) In no event may the Agency deny any claim solely because the victim was a child victim of sexual assault or abuse, and the victim either delayed reporting the abuse or assault to authorities or the victim delayed an application for services to mitigate the effects of the impact of sexual assault or abuse. (59 Del. Laws, c. 519, \u00a7 1; 65 Del. Laws, c. 268, \u00a7 3; 68 Del. Laws, c. 35, \u00a7 2; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 71 Del. Laws, c. 18, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2; 72 Del.

In support of the reimbursement claim, the Agency shall submit an affidavit with supporting documentation to the sentencing court, setting forth all payments made to the claimant. Restitution may be awarded to the Agency. A hearing on restitution will be held on the timely request of the defendant. Where the compensation of the claimant is continuing, and the full amount of reimbursement due has not been established by the Agency, the affidavit may so state, and the sentencing court may reserve jurisdiction over any future claim for reimbursement to the Agency. Any supplemental claim for reimbursement to the Agency must be brought within 2 years of the sentencing date, or before the expiration of a term of probation imposed on the defendant for an offense giving rise to the claim for compensation, whichever date comes first.

Where multiple offenses are involved, the penalty assessment must be based on the total fine for all offenses. When a fine, penalty, or forfeiture is suspended, in whole or in part, the penalty assessment must not be suspended; provided, however, that if the penalty assessment herein imposed remains uncollected for a period in excess of 3 years, the courts may expunge the record of the assessment. (b) Upon collection of the penalty assessment, the penalty assessment must be paid over to the prothonotary or clerk of court, as the case may be, who shall collect the penalty assessment and transmit it to the State Treasury to be deposited in a separate account for the administration of this chapter, which account must be designated the \"Victims' Compensation Fund,\" which is hereby created.

(7) A complete record shall be kept of all interviews held in connection with the administrative investigation. Upon request, a copy of the record or recording of the interviews shall be provided to the officer. (8) If the law-enforcement officer under interrogation is under arrest or may reasonably be placed under arrest as a result of the investigation, the officer shall be informed of the officer's rights, including the reasonable possibility of the officer's arrest prior to the commencement of the interrogation. (9) Upon request, any officer under questioning shall have the right to be represented by counsel or other representative of the officer's choice, who shall be present at all times during the questioning unless waived in writing by the investigated officer. The questioning shall be suspended for a reasonable period of time if the officer requests representation until such time as the officer can obtain the representative requested if reasonably available. (10) An officer who is charged with violating any departmental rules or regulations, or the officer's representative, will be provided access to transcripts, records, written statements, written reports, and video and audio recordings pertinent to the case if they are exculpatory, intended to support any disciplinary action or are to be introduced in the departmental hearing on the charges involved. Upon demand by the officer or counsel, they shall be produced within 48 hours of the written notification of the charges. (11) At the conclusion of the formal investigation, the investigator shall inform in writing the officer of the investigative findings, conclusions, and any recommendation for further action.

Propositioning sex or commission of a sexual act while an officer is on duty is deemed a \"sexual assault.\" d. An investigation that results in a sustained finding that a law-enforcement officer engaged in dishonest conduct. This includes, but is not limited to sustained findings of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, witness tampering, and destruction, falsification, or concealment of evidence. e. A sustained finding of domestic violence by a law-enforcement officer. (2) The detailed narratives required by this subsection may not reveal the name or any personal identifying information of a victim or witness. In a domestic violence case where revealing the name of the officer would also allow identification of the victim, the officer's name may be redacted. (3) The Criminal Justice Council shall post the narratives they receive under this paragraph on their website within 30 calendar days of receipt. (b) Departments shall provide information to a complainant or victim of officer misconduct regarding the resolution of that complaint, including the investigative findings, conclusions, and any recommendation for further action. (c) (1) Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, the Department of Justice must disclose in a criminal or delinquency matter, at the request of a defendant, all existing records, including those contained in a personnel or disciplinary file, relating to sustained findings of misconduct relating to perjury, witness tampering, intentional false statements or false reports, or destruction, falsification, or concealment of evidence by an officer who participated in the investigation or prosecution. (2) The Department of Justice is responsible for gathering records from law-enforcement agencies that are responsive to a request under paragraph (c)(1) of this section and shall facilitate the transfer of records, pursuant to a confidentiality order entered by the court that restricts use or dissemination of such information beyond proceedings in that case and requires secure handling of the records. (3) The Department of Justice shall diligently advise all agencies involved in criminal and juvenile justice matters of the agencies' continuing duty to identify, preserve, and disclose to the prosecutor, information required to be disclosed under this subsection. (4) Prior to the transfer of records under this subsection, the Department of Justice shall redact all of the following: a. The home address, home telephone number, work or school address, work telephone number, e-mail address, and Social Security number of a law-enforcement officer or officer's family member, a complainant or complainant's family member, or a witness or witness' family member. b. The medical history and detailed medical information of a law-enforcement officer or a complainant. This paragraph (c)(4)b. may not be construed to permit redactions to any descriptions of injuries or conditions that are the subject of the complaint or caused by or resulting from a law-enforcement officer's alleged conduct. (d) A law-enforcement agency must disclose to the Department of Justice unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct in which the following 3 criteria are satisfied: (1) A formal investigation is ongoing. (2) The allegations relate to perjury, witness tampering, intentional false statements or false reports, or destruction, falsification, or concealment of evidence by an officer who participated in the investigation or prosecution of a pending criminal matter. (3) The misconduct at issue is alleged to have occurred in the course of the officer's participation in the investigation or prosecution of that same pending criminal matter. (e) In addition to any existing obligation under federal or Delaware state law, the Department of Justice has the following disclosure obligations to the defense in a criminal or delinquency matter: (1) The Department shall immediately disclose an unsubstantiated allegation of misconduct meeting the criteria in subsection (d) of this section where the evidence or information is exculpatory. (2) The Department shall disclose an unsubstantiated allegation of misconduct meeting the criteria in subsection (d) of this section where the evidence or information is admissible for impeachment of a witness.Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 434(3) The Department shall submit to the Court for in camera review all unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct meeting the criteria in subsection (d) of this section that are not otherwise disclosed to the defendant. Upon review, the Court shall order disclosure of an unsubstantiated allegation of misconduct if it is determined to be exculpatory or admissible for impeachment of witness. Where the Court orders disclosure, the disclosure shall be made under a protective order. (f) If an allegation disclosed under subsections (d) and (e) of this section is determined at the conclusion of the formal investigation to be unsubstantiated, information relating to that allegation may not be used in any criminal or delinquency proceeding. (g) A law-enforcement agency must require every new hire to sign an agreement allowing that officer's personnel file, and any disciplinary or investigative records relating to misconduct to be shared with any future law-enforcement agency, in this State or another jurisdiction, that hires or has made a conditional offer of hire to that officer. The sharing of these records with another law-enforcement agency that hires or makes a conditional offer of hire to an officer is not a violation of this chapter. (84 Del. Laws, c. 148, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 9211. Annual reporting and record retention. (a) Beginning in 2024, each law-enforcement agency shall annually report to the Criminal Justice Council (CJC), and the CJC shall post on its website, all of the following information: (1) The number of public complaints and internal complaints relating to police misconduct that the department receives each year, broken down by subject matter of the complaint.

(a) A victim or an individual designated by the victim may be present whenever a defendant has a right to be present during a court proceeding concerning the crime charged other than a grand jury proceeding, unless good cause can be shown by the defendant to exclude the victim. If the victim is present, the court, at the victim's request, shall permit the presence of an individual to provide support to the victim, unless the court determines that exclusion of the individual is necessary to protect the defendant's right to a fair trial. (b) The victim shall promptly be informed of the date, time and place of each court proceeding relative to the disposition of the case at which the victim has a right to be present, unless a victim requests that notice of proceedings not be provided under this chapter.

(76 Del. Laws, c. 294, \u00a7 1.) Subchapter II Victims and Witnesses with Cognitive Disabilities \u00a7 9421. Legislative intent. The General Assembly finds that it is necessary to provide every victim and witness with a cognitive disability, particularly those whose disability renders them the emotional or mental equivalent of a child, with additional consideration and different treatment than that usually required for adult victims and witnesses who are not cognitively disabled. It is therefore the intent of the General Assembly to provide each victim and witness with a cognitive disability who is involved in a criminal proceeding with certain fundamental rights and protections. (74 Del. Laws, c. 44, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 9422. Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this subchapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: (1) \"Cognitive disability\" means a developmental disability that substantially impairs an individual's cognitive abilities including, but not limited to, delirium, dementia and other organic brain disorders for which there is an identifiable pathologic condition, as well as nonorganic brain disorders commonly called functional disorders. \"Cognitive disability\" also includes conditions of mental retardation, severe cerebral palsy, and any other condition found to be closely related to mental retardation because such condition results in the impairment of general intellectual functioning or adaptive behavior similar to that of persons who have been diagnosed with mental retardation, or such condition requires treatment and services similar to those required for persons who have been diagnosed with mental retardation. (2) \"Victim\" or \"witness\" shall not include any person with a cognitive disability accused of committing a felony; provided however, that the word \"victim\" or \"witness\" may, in the court's discretion, include: a. A person with a cognitive disability where such person's participation in a felony appears to have been induced, coerced or unwilling; or b. A person with a cognitive disability who has participated in the felony, but who has subsequently and voluntarily agreed to testify on behalf of the State. (74 Del. Laws, c. 44, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 9423. Expedited proceedings. In all criminal proceedings involving a victim or witness with a cognitive disability, the court and the prosecution shall take appropriate action to ensure a prompt trial in order to minimize the length of time the victim or witness must endure the stress of the victim's or witness's involvement in the proceedings. In ruling on any motion or other request for a delay or continuance of proceedings, the court shall consider and give weight to any adverse impact such delay or continuance might have on the well-being of any victim or witness with a cognitive disability. (74 Del. Laws, c. 44, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 9424. Additional rights and services. (a) A victim or witness with a cognitive disability is entitled to an explanation, in language the victim or witness understands, of all legal proceedings in which the victim or witness is to be involved. (b) A victim or witness with a cognitive disability is entitled to be accompanied, in all proceedings, by a \"friend\" or other person in whom the victim or witness trusts, which person shall be permitted to advise the judge, when appropriate and as a friend of the court, regarding the person with a cognitive disability and that person's ability to understand proceedings and questions.Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 443(c) A victim or witness with a cognitive disability is entitled to information about, and referrals to, appropriate social services and programs to assist the victim or witness, and the victim's or witness's family, in coping with the emotional impact of the crime, and the subsequent court proceedings in which the victim or witness is to become involved.

Laws, c. 92, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 9501. Purpose. (a) The General Assembly finds and declares that: (1) The resolution of felony, misdemeanor and juvenile delinquent offenses can be costly and complex in a judicial setting where the parties involved are necessarily in an adversary posture and subject to formalized procedures; and (2) Victim-offender alternative case resolutions can meet the needs of Delaware's citizens by providing forums in which persons may voluntarily participate in the resolution of certain criminal offenses in an informal and less adversarial atmosphere. (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly that each program established under this chapter do all of the following: (1) Establish and use victim-offender alternative case resolution programs to help meet the need for alternatives to the courts for the resolution of certain criminal offenses, whether before or after adjudication. (2) Encourage continuing community participation in the development, administration and oversight of local victim-offender alternative case resolution. (3) Offer structures for victim-offender alternative case resolution which may serve as models for programs in other communities. (4) [Repealed.] (70 Del. Laws, c. 444, \u00a7 1; 82 Del.

The Attorney General may also provide for the health, safety, security and welfare of the immediate family of, or a person otherwise closely associated with, such witness or potential witness if the family or person may also be endangered on account of the participation of the witness in the judicial proceeding. (1) The Attorney General shall issue guidelines defining the types of cases for which the exercise of the authority of the Attorney General as set forth in this subchapter would be appropriate. (2) The State and its officers and employees shall not be subject to any civil liability on account of any decision to provide or not to provide services under this subchapter. (b) In connection with the provision of services under this subchapter to a witness, a potential witness, or an immediate family member or close associate of a witness or potential witness, the Attorney General shall take such action as the Attorney General determines to be necessary to protect the person involved from bodily injury or otherwise to assure the health, safety, security and welfare of that person, including the psychological well-being and social adjustment of that person, for as long as, in the judgment of the Attorney General, the danger to that person exists. The Attorney General may provide some or all of the following services by regulation: (1) Provide suitable documents to enable the person to establish a new identity or otherwise protect the person; (2) Provide housing for the person; (3) Provide for the transportation of household furniture and other personal property to a new residence of the person; (4) Provide to the person a payment to meet basic living expenses, in a sum established in accordance with regulations issued by the Attorney General, for such time as the Attorney General determines to be warranted; (5) Assist the person in obtaining employment; (6) Provide other services necessary to assist the person in becoming self-sustaining; (7) Disclose or refuse to disclose the identity or location of the person relocated or protected, or any other matter concerning the person or the program after weighing the danger such a disclosure would pose to the person, the detriment it would cause to the general effectiveness of the program, and the benefit it would afford to the public or to the person seeking the disclosure, except that the Attorney General shall, upon the request of law-enforcement officials or pursuant to a court order, without undue delay, disclose to such officials the identity, location, criminal records and fingerprints relating to the person relocated or protected when the Attorney General knows or the request indicates that the person is under investigation for or has been arrested for or charged with an offense that is punishable by more than one year in prison or that is a crime of violence; (8) Exempt procurement for services, materials, and supplies, and the renovation and construction of safe sites within existing buildings from other provisions of law as may be required to maintain the security of protective witnesses and the integrity of the witness security program established pursuant to this subchapter; (9) Authorize expenditures to provide to law-enforcement protection to ensure the safety and security of the person and/or the person's dwelling and/or the person's place of business; and (10) Authorize other expenditures and/or provide other services reasonably intended to provide for the health, safety, security and welfare of the person.

A psychological evaluation shall only be required if the Attorney General intends to establish a new identityTitle 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 447and/or a new permanent place of residence for the person. The Attorney General shall also make a written assessment in each case of the seriousness of the investigation or case in which the person's information or testimony has been or will be provided and the possible risk of danger to other persons and property which could be created by providing services to a person and shall determine whether the need for that person's testimony outweighs the risk of danger to the public. In assessing whether services should be provided to a person under this subchapter, the Attorney General shall consider the person's criminal record, alternatives to providing services under this subchapter, the possibility of securing similar testimony from other sources, the need for protecting the person, the relative importance of the person's testimony, the results of psychological examinations, whether providing such services will substantially infringe upon the relationship between a child who would be relocated in connection with such services and that child's parent who would not be so relocated, and such other factors as the Attorney General considers appropriate. The Attorney General shall not provide services to any person under this subchapter if the risk of danger to the public created by the provision of such services, including the potential harm to innocent victims, outweighs the need for that person's testimony. This subsection shall not be construed to authorize the disclosure of the written assessment made pursuant to this subsection. (2) In addition to the requirements set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, before providing services under this subchapter which are intended to establish a new identity and/or a new permanent place of residence for the person, the Attorney General shall secure a psychological evaluation of the person which shall assess the risk of danger to the public, including the potential harm to innocent victims, potentially created by the provision of such services. (f) Before providing services to any person under this subchapter, the Attorney General shall enter into a memorandum of understanding with that person. Each such memorandum of understanding shall set forth the responsibilities of that person, including: (1) The agreement of the person, if a witness or potential witness, to testify and provide information to all appropriate law-enforcement officials concerning all appropriate proceedings; (2) The agreement of the person not to commit any crime; (3) The agreement of the person to take all necessary steps to avoid detection by others of the facts concerning the services provided to that person under this subchapter; (4) The agreement of the person to comply with legal obligations and civil judgments against that person; (5) The agreement of the person to cooperate with all reasonable requests of officers and employees of the state and other law- enforcement officers who are providing services under this subchapter; (6) The agreement of the person to designate another person to act as agent for the service of process; (7) The agreement of the person to make a sworn statement of all outstanding legal obligations, including obligations concerning child custody and visitation; (8) The agreement of the person to disclose any probation or parole responsibilities, and if the person is on probation or parole under the laws of another State, to consent to supervision by the State of Delaware; and (9) The agreement of the person to regularly inform the appropriate program official of the activities and current address of such person. Each such memorandum of understanding shall also set forth the services which the Attorney General has determined will be provided to the person under this subchapter, and the procedures to be followed in the case of a breach of the memorandum of understanding, as such procedures are established by the Attorney General. Such procedures shall include a procedure for filing and resolution of grievances of persons provided services under this subchapter regarding the administration of the program. This procedure shall include the opportunity for resolution of a grievance by a person who was not involved in the case. (g) (1) The attorney General shall enter into a separate memorandum of understanding pursuant to this subsection with each person to whom services are provided under this subchapter who is 18 years of age or older. The memorandum of understanding shall be signed by the Attorney General and the person to whom services are provided. (2) The Attorney General may delegate the responsibility initially to authorize services under this subchapter only to the Chief Deputy Attorney General or the State Prosecutor. (h) If the Attorney General determines that harm to the person for whom services may be provided under this subchapter is imminent or that failure to provide immediate services would otherwise seriously jeopardize an ongoing investigation, the Attorney General may provide temporary services to such person under this subchapter before making the written assessment and determination required by subsection (e) of this section or entering into the memorandum of understanding required by subsection (f) of this section. In such a case the Attorney General shall make such assessment and determination and enter into such memorandum of understanding without undue delay after the services are initiated. (i) The Attorney General may terminate the services provided under this subchapter to any person who substantially breaches the memorandum of understanding entered into between the Attorney General and that person pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, or who provides false information concerning the memorandum of understanding or the circumstances pursuant to which the person was provided services under this subchapter, including information with respect to the nature and circumstances concerning child custody and visitation. Before terminating such services, the Attorney General shall send notice to the person involved of the termination of the services provided under this subchapter and the reasons for the termination. The decision of the Attorney General to terminate such services shall not be subject to judicial review. (74 Del. Laws, c. 57, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 78 Del. Laws, c. 28, \u00a7 1.)Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 448\u00a7 9602. Civil judgments. (a) If a person provided services which include the establishment of a new identity and/or new place of permanent residence under this subchapter is named as a defendant in a civil cause of action arising prior to or during the period in which the services are provided, process in the civil proceeding may be served upon that person or an agent designated by that person for that purpose. The Attorney General shall make reasonable efforts to serve a copy of the process upon the person protected at the person's last known address. The Attorney General shall notify the plaintiff in the action whether such process has been served. If a judgment in such action is entered against that person, the Attorney General shall determine whether the person has made reasonable efforts to comply with the judgment. The Attorney General shall take appropriate steps to urge the person to comply with the judgment. If the Attorney General determines that the person has not made reasonable efforts to comply with the judgment, the Attorney General may, after considering the danger to the person and upon the request of the person holding the judgment, disclose the identity and location of the person to the plaintiff entitled to recovery pursuant to the judgment. Any such disclosure of the identity and location of the person shall be made upon the express condition that further disclosure by the plaintiff of such identity or location may be made only if essential to the plaintiff's efforts to recover under the judgment, and only to such additional persons as is necessary to effect the recovery. Any such disclosure or nondisclosure by the Attorney General shall not subject the State and its officers or employees to any civil liability. (b) (1) Any person who holds a judgment entered by a federal or state court in that person's favor against a person provided services which include the establishment of a new identity and/or a new place of employment under this subchapter may, upon a decision by the Attorney General to deny disclosure of the current identity and location of such person, bring an action against the person in the Superior Court. Such action shall be brought within 120 days after the petitioner requested the Attorney General to disclose the identity and location of the person to whom services have been provided under this subchapter. The complaint in such action shall contain statements that the petitioner holds a valid judgment of a federal or state court against a person provided services under this subchapter and that the petitioner sought to enforce the judgment by requesting the Attorney General to disclose the identity and location of such person. (2) The petitioner in an action described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall notify the Attorney General of the action at the same time the action is brought. The Attorney General shall appear in the action and shall affirm or deny the statements in the complaint that the person against whom the judgment is allegedly held is provided services under this subchapter and that the petitioner requested the Attorney General to disclose the identity and location of such person for the purpose of enforcing the judgment. (3) Upon a determination: a. That the petitioner holds a judgment entered by a federal or state court; and b. That the Attorney General has declined to disclose to the petitioner the current identify and location of the person against whom the judgment was entered, the court shall appoint a guardian to act on behalf of the petitioner to enforce the judgment. The clerk of the court shall forthwith furnish the guardian with a copy of the order of appointment. The Attorney General shall disclose to the guardian the current identity and location of the person to whom services have been provided and any other information necessary to enable the guardian to carry out that guardian's duties under this subsection. (4) It is the duty of the guardian to proceed with all reasonable diligence and dispatch to enforce the rights of the petitioner under the judgment. The guardian shall, however, endeavor to carry out such enforcement duties in a manner that maximizes, to the extent practicable, the safety and security of the person to whom services have been provided under this subchapter. In no event shall the guardian disclose the new identity or location of such person without the permission of the Attorney General, except that such disclosure may be made to a federal or state court in order to enforce the judgment. Any good faith disclosure made by the guardian in the performance of the guardian's duties under this subsection shall not create any civil liability against the State or any of its officers or employees, or the guardian. (5) Upon appointment, the guardian shall have the power to perform any act with respect to the judgment which the petitioner could perform, including the initiation of judicial enforcement actions in any federal or state court or the assignment of such enforcement actions to a third party under applicable federal or state law. The Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure shall apply in any action brought under this subsection to enforce a federal or state court judgment. (6) The cost of any action brought under this subsection with respect to a judgment, including any enforcement action described herein, and the compensation to be allowed to a guardian appointed in any such action shall be fixed by the court and shall be apportioned among the parties as follows: a. The petitioner shall be assessed the amount the petitioner would have paid to collect on the judgment in an action not arising under the provisions of this subsection; and b. The protected person shall be assessed the costs which are normally charged to debtors in similar actions and any other costs which are incurred as a result of an action brought under this subsection. In the event that the costs and compensation to the guardian are not met by the petitioner or by the protected person, the court may, in its discretion, enter judgment against the state for costs and fees reasonably incurred as a result of the action brought under this subsection.Title 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 449(7) No officer or employee of the Department of Justice shall in any way impede the efforts of a guardian appointed under this subsection to enforce the judgment with respect to which the guardian was appointed. (c) The provisions of this section shall not apply to a court order to which \u00a7 9603 of this title applies. (74 Del. Laws, c. 57, \u00a7 1; 70 Del. Laws, c. 186, \u00a7 1; 78 Del. Laws, c. 28, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 9603. Child custody arrangement. (a) The Attorney General may not relocate any child in connection with services provided to a person under this subchapter if it appears that a person other than that protected person has legal custody of that child. (b) Before services which include the establishment of a new identity and/or new place of permanent residence are provided under this subchapter to any person: (1) Who is a parent of a child of whom that person has custody; and (2) Who has obligations to another parent of that child with respect to custody or visitation of that child under a court order, the Attorney General shall obtain and examine a copy of such order for the purpose of assuring that compliance with the order can be achieved. If compliance with a visitation order cannot be achieved, the Attorney General may provide services under this subchapter to the person only if the parent being relocated initiates legal action to modify the existing court order under paragraph (e)(1) of this section. The parent being relocated must agree in writing before being provided such services to abide by any ensuing court orders issued as a result of an action to modify. (c) With respect to any person provided services which include the establishment of a new identity and/or new place of permanent residence under this subchapter: (1) Who is the parent of a child who is relocated in connection with such services; and (2) Who has obligations to another parent of that child with respect to custody or visitation of that child under a state court order, the Attorney General shall, as soon as practicable after the person and child are so relocated, notify in writing the child's parent who is not so relocated that a child has been provided services under this subchapter. The notification shall also include statements that the rights of the parent not so relocated to visitation or custody, or both, under the court order shall not be infringed by the relocation of the child and the Department of Justice responsibility with respect thereto. The Department of Justice will pay all reasonable costs of transportation and security incurred in insuring that visitation can occur at a secure location, but in no event shall it be obligated to pay such costs for visitation in excess of 30 days a year. Additional visitation may be paid for, in the discretion of the Attorney General, by the Department of Justice in extraordinary circumstances. In the event that the unrelocated parent pays visitation costs, the Department of Justice may, in the discretion of the Attorney General, extend security arrangements associated with such visitation. (d) (1) With respect to any person provided services which include the establishment of a new identity and/or new place of permanent residence under this subchapter: a. Who is the parent of a child who is relocated in connection with such services; and b. Who has obligations to another parent of that child with respect to custody or visitation of that child under a court order, an action to modify that court order may be brought by any party to the court order in the Family Court in the county in which the child's parent resides who has not been relocated in connection with such services. (2) With respect to actions brought under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Family Court shall establish a procedure to provide a reasonable opportunity for the parties to the court order to mediate their dispute with respect to the order. The court shall provide a mediator for this purpose. If the dispute is mediated, the court shall issue an order in accordance with the resolution of the dispute. (3) If, within 60 days after an action is brought under paragraph (d)(1) of this section hereof to modify a court order, the dispute has not been mediated, any party to the court order may request arbitration of the dispute. In the case of such a request, the court shall appoint a commissioner to act as arbitrator, who shall be experienced in domestic relations matters. The court and the commissioner shall, in determining the dispute, give substantial deference to the need for maintaining parent-child relationships, and any order issued by the court shall be in the best interests of the child. In actions to modify a court order brought under this subsection, the court and the commissioner shall apply the law of the State in which the court order was issued. The costs to the state of carrying out a court order may be considered in an action brought under this subsection to modify that court order but shall not outweigh the relative interests of the parties themselves and the child. (4) Until a court order is modified under this subsection, all parties to that court order shall comply with their obligations under that court order subject to the limitations set forth in this section. (5) With respect to any person provided services which include the establishment of a new identity and/or new place of permanent residence under this subchapter who is the parent of a child who is relocated in connection with such services, the parent not relocated in connection with such services may bring an action in the Family Court for violation by that protected person of a court order with respect to custody or visitation of that child. If the court finds that such a violation has occurred, the court may hold the person to whom services have been provided in contempt. Once held in contempt, the person to whom such services have been provided shall have a maximum of 60 days, in the discretion of the Attorney General, to comply with the court order. If the person fails to comply with the order within the time specified by theTitle 11 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure Page 450Attorney General, the Attorney General shall disclose the new identity and address of the protected person to the other parent and terminate any financial assistance to such person unless otherwise directed by the court. (6) The State shall pay litigation costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by a parent who prevails in enforcing a custody or visitation order, but shall retain the right to recover such costs from the person to whom services have been provided under this subchapter. (e) (1) In any case in which the Attorney General determines that, as a result of the relocation of a person and a child of whom that person is a parent in connection with the provision of services under this subchapter, the implementation of a court order with respect to custody or visitation of that child would be substantially impossible, the Attorney General may bring, on behalf of the person provided services under this subchapter, an action to modify the court order. Such action may be brought in the county in which the parent resides who would not be or was not relocated in connection with the services provided under this subchapter. In an action brought under this paragraph, if the Attorney General establishes, by clear and convincing evidence, that implementation of the court order involved would be substantially impossible, the court may modify the court order but shall, subject to appropriate security considerations, provide an alternative as substantially equivalent to the original rights of the nonrelocating parent as feasible under the circumstances. (2) With respect to any state court order in effect to which this section applies, if the parent who is not relocated in connection with the services provided under this subchapter intentionally violates a reasonable security requirement imposed by the Attorney General with respect to the implementation of that court order, the Attorney General may bring an action in the county in which that parent resides to modify the court order. The court may modify the court order if the court finds such an intentional violation. The procedures for mediation and arbitration provided herein shall not apply to actions for modification brought under this subsection. (f) In any case in which a person provided services which include the establishment of a new identity and/or new place of permanent residence under this subchapter is the parent of a child of whom that person has custody and has obligations to another parent of that child concerning custody and visitation of that child which are not imposed by court order, that person, or the parent not relocated in connection with such services may bring an action in the county in which the parent not relocated resides to obtain an order providing for custody or visitation, or both, of that child. In any such action, all the provisions of subsection (d) of this section shall apply. (g) In any case in which an action under this section involves court orders from different States with respect to custody or visitation of the same child, the court shall resolve any conflicts by applying the rules of conflict of laws of the state in which the court is sitting. (h) (1) Subject to paragraph (h)(2) of this section, the costs of any action described in subsection (d), (e) or (f) of this section shall be paid by the State. (2) The Attorney General shall insure that any state court order in effect to which this section applies is carried out. The Department of Justice shall pay all costs and fees described in subsections (c) and (d) of this section. (i) As used in this section, the term \"parent\" includes any person who stands in the place of a parent by law. (74 Del. Laws, c. 57, \u00a7 1; 78 Del. Laws, c. 28, \u00a7 1.) \u00a7 9604.
