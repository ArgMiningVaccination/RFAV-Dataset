What are Psilocybin Mushrooms? [Psilocybin mushrooms](https://thethirdwave.co/psychedelics/shrooms/) have been used by humans for centuries for recreational and spiritual purposes.

Psilocin is much more bioactive than psilocybin, which actually transforms into psilocin once ingested. The effects of psilocin are similar to those produced by mescaline and LSD and can last for several hours.
