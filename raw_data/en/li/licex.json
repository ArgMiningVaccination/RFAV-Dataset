During the group sound healing, the participant will be laying in a supported supine position. Several protocols will be played to facilitate deep healing, relaxation and stress reduction. The bowls will also be played near or on the body. Please wear comfortable and loose clothing without exposed buttons and/or zippers. Please bring your own props including mat, pillows/bolsters and blankets. Join us and drift into a space of deep peace and relaxation. "}
