Most experts cite \"Vaccine Hesitancy\" as the reason for this slowdown. But what is vaccine hesitancy, and what causes it? Many older adults choose to get all recommended vaccines, all the time. However, although vaccination has become a routine part of preventive care in America, many older adults refuse vaccines entirely - and others find the decision more complex and make it on a case-by-case basis. Experts consider adults who selectively choose which vaccines to accept to be vaccine hesitant. The term vaccine hesitancy has come to encompass a range of meanings. It may describe general resistance toward vaccines, complete opposition to any vaccines, or more deliberate and specific pattern of actions. The World Health Organization's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization concluded that vaccine hesitancy refers to selective vaccination behavior that is influenced by multiple factors, including safety concerns, affordability, and accessibility. AARP, through the AARP Public Policy Institute (PPI) has done considerable research into the reasoning behind vaccine hesitancy among older adults. Older adults considering vaccinations state that they need honest, factual information from a trusted messenger, according to a recent AARP PPI survey. According to that survey, most (91%) older adults think vaccines are safe and believe vaccines are a good way to protect themselves and their family (86%) as well as society at large (86%). Nevertheless, most older adults do not get all of the recommended vaccinations. Less than half (45%) of all adults ages 50-plus report they get all of the vaccines their doctor or health care provider suggests, and a quarter (26%) say they only get a few or none of the recommended vaccines. Those ages 65-plus are significantly more likely than those ages 50 to 64 to say they get all of the vaccines their doctor or health care provider recommends (56% vs. 35%). For those unlikely to get vaccinated, many say they forgo the vaccines because they are concerned about possible side effects. Some are even concerned about side effects from the flu vaccine, which is notable given its long history. When asked why they are not likely to get a flu vaccine, four in 10 (41%) say they are concerned about possible side effects. Similarly, those who say they are unlikely to get a COVID-19 vaccine cite concern about side effects (59%). In addition to concern about possible side effects, trust is also a pivotal issue for those considering whether to get a recommended vaccine. Unfortunately, more than half (53%) of those ages 50-plus say they don't know whom to trust when it comes to vaccine information. When prompted with a list, though, most (74%) say they trust their doctor or health care provider on the topic. With the COVID-19 vaccine specifically, most (71%) older adults say they highly trust their doctor or health care provider to provide honest and factual information about the vaccine. Many believe the recent guidance from the CDC that virtually eliminates the masking requirements for vaccinated people, will give unvaccinated people the needed incentive to get vaccinated. Others are hoping that recent studies demonstrating the effectiveness of the COVID vaccines will convince even more unvaccinated people to get vaccinated. In the meantime, the CDC is adamant that the science for unvaccinated people is clear. At a recent press conference, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, M.D. stated \"You remain at risk of mild or severe illness, death or spreading the disease to others. You should still mask and you should get vaccinated right away.\" [Contact information and more](https://states.aarp.org/west-virginia/about-aarp-west-virginia)from your state office.
