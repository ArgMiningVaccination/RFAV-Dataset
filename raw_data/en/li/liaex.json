The Scientic Review & Editorial Committee (SREC) is charged with creating and reviewing educa- tional content to produce high-quality CE for the AAEP. The committee is composed of AAEP membervolunteers from both small and large private practices as well as academia and industry. Membersinclude both general practitioners and specialists. The 2020 program includes invited papers for the \"In-depth\" and \"How to\" sessions as well as sessions comprised of papers that independent authors submitted for consideration. Topic choices for theinvited \"In-depth\" and \"How to\" sessions are based on member feedback from AAEP CE Needs Analysissurveys. Topic session leaders are selected by the Program Chair, and then these session leaders invitea slate of speakers to prepare the papers that become an \"In-depth\" overview or a series of related \"Howto\" talks. Although invited, these papers undergo a rigorous peer review process by the SREC. Papers submitted by independent authors are each assigned 3 reviewers from the SREC. The reviewers do not know the names of the authors. Content is scored using the criteria of Study Design, StudyQuality, Innovation and Impact, Practicality, and Manuscript Quality. This year 158 papers weresubmitted for the 71 available slots on the program. Non-scientic sessions addressing business, ethical, and industry concerns are also planned as the scientic program materializes. Speakers who are invited to participate in these sessions preparepapers that are also reviewed by members of the SREC for inclusion in the Proceedings. The peer review process for the AAEP Proceedings is rigorous. It requires an enormous effort by every one of the 50 members of the SREC to create the best possible program for the AAEP membership. Manyvolunteer hours were spent putting together the 2020 program, so please thank them for all their hardwork creating this program for you. ii 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFrom Your President Dear AAEP Members & Guests: The 2020 Annual Convention Program Chair, Scott Hay, and the Educational Programs Committee and Scientic Review & Editorial Committee (EPCSREC)have kept with our value and history of unparalleled continuing education, boththrough traditional and new, creative means. In the 2020 conference you willnd our traditional educationally packed proceedings book as well as the oppor-tunity to experience the hard work that has gone into transforming our face-to-face meeting into an innovative AAEP Virtual Convention rich with traditionsyou have come to expect and enjoy. Specically, you will experience the AAEP's high-quality continuing education, along with a rst-class trade show that will offer one-on-one opportunities to meet with exhibitors, and social events to allow attendees tomingle, catch up with old friends and network. The AAEP's EPCSREC worked many hours to develop this program and with the exception of hands-on labs, the content for the virtual program will remain fundamentally the same. We're excited about collaboratingwith speakers to create dynamic virtual presentations and attendees will have access to ALL educationalsessions. For the rst time ever, you will have the opportunity to receive as many hours of continuing educationas AAEP offers. Our hope is to expose even more equine veterinarians to the AAEP through this platform. The Virtual Trade Show promises to be exceptional so be sure to thank our many exhibitors and in particular, our Educational Sponsors. Their support for the AAEP is a key part of our ability to continue to provide suchhigh-quality continuing education. As this unusual year comes to a close, please know that AAEP represents you, the equine veterinarian, on many issues. I was proud to represent the AAEP and saw the impact AAEP members have on the veterinaryand equine industry. The Board of Directors have been outstanding, and I would like to thank each of them forworking so hard towards the mission of our organization. It has been a pleasure to serve as AAEP Presidentin 2020. I look forward to 66 /H114082020 iii From Your President-Elect and Program Chair Hello AAEP members, students, and guests and welcome to the AAEP 66thAAEP Virtual Annual Convention & Trade Show! As the 2020 Program Chair, I must say, it has been an interesting year. Although disappointed to not be able to see everyone in person, we are excited about the opportunities for education and connection presented by a Virtual Convention & TradeShow. We will work hard to bring you the unique events you love and are committed to virtually hosting many of the popularelements, including peer-reviewed education and connection to Trade Show exhibitors from the equine industry. This program would not have been possible without the members of the Educational Programs and Scientic Review & Editorial Committees, led by Chair Dr. Charlie Scoggin and Dr. Tracy Norman. The committee members put an extraordi-nary amount of time into selecting topics and reviewing papers in order to present a high quality and balanced meeting forour broad range of member interests. Some \"Must See\" virtual offerings this year include. . . The Kester News Hour: Always popular, the same exciting format debuted in 2019 will be offered once again and include anchors, a forecaster, sportscaster, and eld reporter. This will be a fast-paced, cutting edge session with the latest veterinary research and equine news topics and an abundance of take-home information. Milne Lecture: Dr. John Hubbell, world renowned expert in equine anesthesia and pain management, will trace the development of current anesthetic methods, identify current-day best practices and areas of needed improvement, andpostulate pathways for enhancing the safety of equine anesthesia in the future. In-depth Sessions: We'll go \"in-depth\" examining lameness, imaging, neonatology, and medication and therapeutics for performance horses. How-to Sessions: Practical information and techniques will be presented on how to manage hoof lameness, nutrition, and medication and therapeutics for performance horses. These talks are intended to allow the practitioner to go back to theirpractice and immediately implement. Other Sessions not to miss are Basic to Basics: The Acute Abdomen in the Field; Ethics-Handling Difcult Conver- sations; Safety Issues and Efforts in Equine Sport: Past, Present, and Future; and Physical Wellbeing. Business Education: The business education theme for 2020 is \"The Healthy Practice\" and topics will include student loan repayment strategies, cannabis and legal conundrums, pregnancy in practice, and much more to help youmanage your practice and personal life.

Table Topics: These interactive sessions will be offered in full force with many of your favorites as well as some new topics. Facilitators with different perspectives will moderate these discussions, answer attendee ques-tions, and provide their input. I want to thank the AAEP Board, Educational Programs Committee, staff, and everyone who has helped make this meetinghappen. Program planning and pivoting to a virtual convention experience will be a challenge but we have such a great group ofvolunteers and members, I have no doubt it will be a success! We appreciate your patience and we'll continue to do everything we can to maintain the same level of education and community our members are accustomed to. Thank you! Sincerely, Scott A.

The AAEP Proceedings is protected by copyright, and information submitted and accepted becomes the prop-erty of AAEP. However, requests for copies or reprintswill be honored by AAEP only with the cooperative per-mission of the presenting author, who by his or herpresentation represents all authors. AAEP reserves theright not to accept any submission without further re-course. Presentations for the AAEP Convention will be selected directly from the review-ready submissions to the AAEP. Submissionsmay include case series with follow-up data, or the results ofexperimental or observational studies as scientic papers, as wellas \"How to\" and review papers. Selection will be made by theScientic Review & Editorial Committee (SERC). The quality ofthe submission will determine the selection. Missing data or pro-posed, but not completed, procedures will exclude the submis-sion from consideration. AAEP invites information dealing withany subject germane to equine practice, but special considerationwill be given to submissions by practitioners and material withpractical content or new information. At least one author of areport describing diagnosis, treatment, or the interpretation ofmedical information should be a veterinarian. All submissions should strictly adhere to the Instructions for Authors. Submissions will be ranked using the AAEP ScoringCriteria and the highest-ranking papers will be selected for theavailable time. Authors are expected to acknowledge all sources of funding or support for the work described and to disclose to the SREC anynancial interest (including ownership, employment, consul-tancy arrangements, or service as an ofcer or board member)they have with companies that manufacture or sell products thatgure prominently in the paper or with companies that manufac-ture or sell competing products. Such an interest will not neces-sarily influence the decision to accept or reject a submission forthe program, but must be included in the Acknowledgments sec-tion for the convention Proceedings. Guidelines: Failure to adhere to the following format will result in non-accep-tance. It is the author's responsibility to convince the SREC of thevalue of the submission, as well as to portray to the reader the contents of the presentation. Specic instructions for Scientic papers, \"How to\" papers, Review papers, < 250 word abstracts, and Business papers can be foundin their respective sections. Format: 12 point, Times New Roman font Double-spaced 1\" margins Proceedings should be written in the third person. Avoid theuse of the rst person and pronouns such as I, we, my, mine,us, our, ours.Example of rst vs. third person:Rather than stating in the rst person: \"We concludedfrom our results that A plus B did not equal C\", use thethird person: \"The results of the study indicated that Aplus B did not equal C\". Headings should include (but are not limited to) the following: 1. Take Home Message2. Introduction3. Materials and Methods4. Results5. Discussion6. Acknowledgments i. Declaration of Ethicsii. Conflicts of Interest 7. References Title: The title should be 15 words or fewer, at the top and on the rstpage. Example:Upper Respiratory Dysfunction in Horses During High SpeedExercise Take Home Message: This should be a concise summary of the main conclusionand should be no longer than two or three sentences (ap-proximately 50 words). \"How to\" papers do not require a take-home message. Example:Local anesthetic injected into the cofn joint is not selectivefor only this joint. Such injections will desensitize much of thenavicular bone and its suspensory ligaments. Introduction: The rationale for the submission should be given brieflyand signicant published work acknowledged here. Theclinical signicance should also be included, as well as aclear statement of the objective or purpose of the submis-sion. The statement of objectives is usually found in thelast sentence of the Introduction. Materials and Methods: This section should describe experimental methodology inthe case of a didactic study or, in the case of a clinical study,should include a description of the population from whichthe animals were selected and how they were selected forinclusion in the report. vi 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSData obtained and how they were obtained must be described. A description of the statistical methods used to summarize data, test hypotheses, and characterize the signicance of resultsshould also be included. Normality of the data should be de-scribed, and statistical analysis should be appropriate for thedistribution of the data (parametric or non-parametric). Forweights and measures, metric units should be used. Dosagesshould be expressed entirely in metric units and with specictime intervals. Example:22 mg/kg, q 12 h, IV (not 10mg/lb, BID, IV) Results: Actual results with numbers and data must be presented.When possible, quantify ndings (mean, median, propor-tion) and present them with appropriate estimates of mea-surement error or uncertainty (such as standard deviation(SD), standard error (SE) or condence interval) in additionto the results of hypothesis testing. If the data can be wellrepresented with a graph or gure, these are encouraged if subsequent publication is not anticipated. If numbers anddata are not presented due to concerns regarding publica-tion in a refereed journal, indications of relative differ-ences between groups such as odds ratios, % change, andsignicant differences must be included in the submissionto be considered acceptable. In these instances, the au-thors should submit the data in the form of means, stan-dard deviations, or other descriptions of comparisonsamong groups in an appendix, which will not be publishedand only used for review purposes. Discussion: Important ndings documented in the results of the study shouldbe stated. Results should be related to other work which has beendone and how the results differ or agree with previously publishedwork and why any differences may have occurred should be dis-cussed. The practical take home message for the equine practi-tioner should be clearly dened and stated in the summarizingnal statement. This statement may be longer, but should besimilar in content to the take home message at the beginning ofthe paper. The following items must be fully explained in the paper: the number of horses that have been worked on, how manywill be affected, and evidence that the procedure works andis safe. Recommended Nomenclature: Anatomy and anatomic planes should be described usingstandard research (e.g., Grayson-Jockey Club Research Foundation,AQHA Foundation) and technical support for work performed.Authors are expected to disclose the nature of any nancial inter-ests (including ownership, employment, consultancy arrange-ments, or service as an ofcer or board member) they have withcompanies that manufacture or sell products that gure promi-nently in the submission or with companies that manufacture orsell competing products.

An exception to this policy will be made for papers report- ing clinical trials conducted in fulllment of the require-ments for the approval of a new drug (FDA) or biologic(USDA). Submitted papers that use compounded drugs or medical devices will undergo a secondary review by an individual(s)with expertise in this area. The individual(s) will then make arecommendation about the suitability of the submission forpotential inclusion in the program. Standard of Care: The AAEP is sensitized to having people use the term \"Stan-dard of Care\" from the podium. If you plan to do this, pleaseinclude this in your abstract or written submitted material sothe SREC can conrm its agreement with your statement. 1. A diagnostic and treatment process that a clinician should follow for a certain type of patient, illness, or clin- ical circumstance. Adjuvant chemotherapy for lung can-cer is \"a new standard of care, but not necessarily the onlystandard of care.\" (New England Journal of Medicine,2004). 2. In legal terms, the level at which the average, prudent provider in a given community would practice. It is howsimilarly qualied practitioners would have managed thepatient's care under the same or similar circumstances.The medical malpractice plaintiff must establish the ap-propriate standard of care and demonstrate that the stan-dard of care has been breached. Deadline: ALL papers must be submitted online by March 15,2018, 3:00 p.m. E.T.; under no circumstances will submis-sions received after the deadline be considered or reviewed.ALL deadlines must be adhered to in order to have the pub-lished Proceedings available at the meeting. Review Process: To respect the integrity of the Annual Convention programand ensure the fairness of the review process, AAEP hasadopted blind reviewing in which the identity of the authorsand reviewers are not known to each other. Papers will bereviewed, scored, and selected by the SREC. Please follow theblinding guidelines below. Blinding Guidelines: The title page and/or front matter of the blinded version of a paper should contain no references to any author or tohis/her afliation. All unpublished works by an author of the submitted man-uscript should be blinded. When referring to an author's publication, the form of thirdperson should be used. Any acknowledgments that identify any authors should beremoved from the blinded version. Also, please delete anynotes that indicate afliation, conference presentations,grants, author or departmental websites, etc. Do not use author name or afliation in the names of thesubmitted les. Scoring Criteria: One goal of the SREC in choosing submissions for the AAEPannual meeting is to combine the best available clinical re-search with clinical experience and expertise to meet theneeds of our patients. The AAEP Scoring Criteria can berequested from cross@aaep.org.Pre-Press Approval: Authors will have nal approval at the page proof stage. Changes/updates in numbers, dosages or inappropriategrammar may be made within one week of receiving pageproofs. Final grammatical changes will be the decision of theeditors.

Authorsmust declare if they have adhered to the Principles ofVeterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA (https://www.avma.org/KB/Policies/Pages/Principles-of-Veterinary-Medi-cal-Ethics-of-the-AVMA.aspx) 1. If your paper or presentation references the use of a com- pounded pharmaceutical, please be certain that you are familiar with the FDA guidelines on its use and that theproduct you reference is in compliance. See section belowregarding papers using compounded medications or med-ical devices. 2. All submissions should cite levels of evidence-based med- icine. You should plan to include any ethical considerations as partof your oral presentation if your paper is accepted. Conflicts of Interest: Authors are expected to disclose the nature of any nancialinterests they have with companies that manufacture or sellproducts that gure prominently in the submission or withcompanies that manufacture or sell competing products.(This includes ownership, employment, consultancy ar-rangements, or service as an ofcer or board member.) Inaddition, if the author provides veterinary business consult-ing services, or earns income through veterinary businesseducational offerings, this should be disclosed. A Conflict ofInterest statement should be included in the paper under theAcknowledgements section whether a conflict exists or not. Example of COI Statement Conflict of Interest: Dr. Jane Doe has served as a paidtechnology analyst for the venture capitalists that initi-ated the formation of Company ABC and served as amember of the Board of Directors of Company ABC fromits inception until 2008. Company ABC is currently com-mercializing the use of Product XYZ. Dr. Jane Doe hasalso served as a paid consultant and continues to serveon the Company ABC Advisory Board.

Any and all authors listed on the paper must disclose any actual or potential conflicts of interest. 2. Any and all authors listed on the paper must disclose if no conflict exists.3. The nature of the conflict (actual or potential) needs to be described. References: Submissions may include references. References to pub- lished works should be limited to what is relevant and nec-essary. Number references in the text with superscriptnumbers consecutively in the order in which they are rstcited. Under references, list all authors when there are threeor fewer; list only the rst three and add \"et al.\" when thereare four or more. The author is responsible for the formattingand accuracy of all reference citations. Since readers fre-quently depend upon the reference citations to guide them infurther reading, it is imperative that the citations are correctso that libraries can locate the papers a reader may wish toobtain. Reference examples can be found in the General In-structions for Authors. Footnotes: References to personal communications and papers submit-ted but not yet accepted for publication should also befootnoted: Figures: The resolution should be at least 300 dpi. Figures should be cited in the text in parentheses (Fig. 1)consecutively in the order of which they are rst men-tioned.

Review Process: Papers will be reviewed, scored, and selected by the SREC.Since the presentation ability of business speakers is cru-cial, the review for these papers requires a two-step process:1. Initial acceptance of the paper while the author is blinded.2. The process becomes un-blinded before nal selectionsare made. This two-step review process was implemented to protect the association from selecting speakers whose presenta-tions may have a strong commercial bend. Blinding Guidelines: The title page and/or front matter of the blinded version ofa paper should contain no references to any author or tohis/her afliation. Any acknowledgments that identify any authors should beremoved from the blinded version. Also, please delete anynotes that indicate afliation, conference presentations,author or departmental websites, etc. xii 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSDo not use author name or afliation in the names of the submitted les. Scoring Criteria: The subject matter is relevant to the business operations ofa veterinary business. How-to cases should be based uponpersonal experience in a veterinary business. Papers de-scribing a business process should be applicable to anequine veterinary business and should be supported by ref-erences from business publications. Pre-Press Approval: Authors will have nal approval at the page proof stage.Changes/updates may be made within one week of receivingpage proofs. Final grammatical changes will be the decisionof the editors. Substantial changes or removal of any datawill result in forfeiture of complimentary registration andtravel, and exclusion from the program. Reimbursement: Presenting authors will receive one complimentary registra-tion and a reimbursement of $550 to help support travel. Mentors for Authors: Paper submissions by private practitioners and rst-timeauthors are highly encouraged. Please email Carey Ross(cross@aaep.org) to request a list of members in various areas of expertise who have agreed to volunteer their time tomentor an author who needs guidance. \"How to\" Paper Submissions for Business of Practice Sessions: \"How to\" papers are presented to describe and explain a technique or procedure that relates to the business of prac-tice. The goal of these papers is to give equine veterinarians the information they need to critically evaluate the pros andcons of the technique and implement it in their practice ifthey choose. \"How to\" papers should follow the same guidelines in this document, except where otherwise noted below. The Title should begin with \"How to . . .\" and clearly iden- tify the technique or procedure that will be presented. A \"Take Home Message\" is not required for \"How to\" papers. The Introduction should include why you use the tech- nique. If there is a problem with the traditional methods orthe currently used method can be improved, this should beexplained. The Materials and Methods section should explain exactly how the technique is performed so that another veterinarianfamiliar with the subject area could follow your example. You may use a step-by-step method for the paper and thepresentation. The Results section should include a summary of what happens when you use this technique. You may use per-sonal assertions or data to assert its value, but you mustexplain how you determined that the technique works. In the Discussion section, you can give your personal views as to why you think the technique works. Discuss thepros and cons of your approach. Explain how the techniqueis helpful and why this should be important to your col-leagues. The end of the discussion should contain a sum-mary of the technique and its advantages in the take homemessage. Case selection, case study number, and case followup should all be included.

Introduction Climate change and the resulting increased severity of weather-related events remains a topic that isstill being vigorously debated at the national level.Regardless of personal stance on this issue, there ismounting evidence that weather conditions in theUnited States appear to be trending toward weatherevents of increased severity. One indicator of in-creased severity of inclement weather patterns liesin the number of incidents that become federallydeclared disasters. The Robert T. Stafford DisasterRelief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1953 autho-rized the President to provide federal assistance tojurisdictions impacted by disasters. 2The disaster declaration process begins at the local level withlocal disaster declarations being declared when theincident overwhelms local response capabilities.The next step occurs at the level of the state govern-ment followed by a federal declaration when stateresources cannot meet the needs of the incidents andwhen the costs of responding to an incident reachesprespecied nancial costs. An easy way to thinkabout this is considering the nancial triggers for afederal declaration as being similar to an individu-al's deductible that's paid prior to their insurancekicking in. In the case of a federal disaster decla- ration, the deductible is the amount of uninsuredlosses including the costs of response reaching apopulation-based level. While there have been ad-justments in policy during the time since the Staf-ford Act was passed, there has been an increasein the numbers of declarations that have occurred(Fig. 1). The discipline of Emergency Management has de- veloped as a mechanism for jurisdictions to providefor their citizens by mitigating risks, developingemergency response plans, being involved in re-sponse, and completing the recovery process whendisasters happen. Emergency managers follow anall-hazards approach with \"all-hazards\" being de-ned as extreme weather or natural events, man-made events including terrorism, or failures ofindustrial facilities and technological systems.The vast majority of incidents are handled by localrst responders. These incidents are categorizedas low-risk/high-frequency incidents. High-risk/low-frequency incidents are those that cause suchsevere damage that rst local and then state re-sources are potentially unable to fulll all responserequirements. 4 AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 1EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT NOTESAn additional way to separate disasters is by the amount of prenotication that is provided prior to an incident. H urricanes typically provide ample warn- ing allowing mitigative steps to be taken and responseplans to be coordinated prior to the incident occurring.No-notice events provide little to no advance noticeand preclude pre-emptive mitigative steps. Exam-ples include tornadoes, mudslides, explosions, andother spontaneously occurring incidents. Disaster scenarios, with the exception of biological events, are in the authors' opinion, by their verynature, chaotic events with chaos often being at itsworst during the rst 24 to 48 hours. This chaosoccurs for many reasons including loss of infrastruc-ture, up-surge in physical threats, and influx of rstresponders, media, and the self deployed. Hurri-cane Harvey provides an excellent example of whythis chaos occurs. This hurricane acted differentlythan expected during the immediate prelandfall pe-riod. It was, at a point within 72 hours of landfall,predicted to be not much more than a \"rain event.\"This prediction did not trigger the normal evacua-tion and preparation protocols. By the time thehurricane intensied to a Category IV storm, evac-uation of many coastal communities was not possi-ble and many either had to make a hasty evacuationor \"ride out\" the storm. The Texas A&M Veteri-nary Emergency Team (VET) was deployed toNueces County, Texas pre-landfall and was posi-tioned at the National Guard Armory just west ofCorpus Christi, Texas. Team members deployedinto the eld shortly after landfall and were metwith numerous destroyed buildings, downed treesand power lines, and a general loss of normal infra-structure. Landfall had introduced a number ofrisks including the potential for sudden collapse ofdamaged buildings and trees, electrocution, torren-tial rainfall and subsequent flooding, and potentialfor toxic exposures in contaminated floodwaters. It is important at this point to understand the differences between the majority of the rst-response community and those focused on respond-ing on behalf of animals. Fireghters, emergencymedical technicians (EMTs) and paramedics, andlaw enforcement ofcers constitute what many typ-ically think of as rst responders. National stan-dards for reghters have been established by theNational Fire Protection Association and provideguidance for a wide range of activities that mayoccur across the different stages of emergency man-agement. 5Law enforcement ofcers also work un- der established standards, in the case of Texas,regulated by the Texas Commission on Law Enforce-ment. 6EMTs and paramedics operate under similar codes and regulations. These rst respond-ers are in addition, employed by local and statejurisdictions. They have a similar \"language\", or-ganizational structure, and standards of training forworking in hazardous environments. They, as wellas elected ofcials and other governmental employ-ees, have legislated requirements for protectingtheir citizens and property within their jurisdic-tional areas. The characteristics described above differ from the general public and specically from those in-volved in animal-related industries. The majorityof veterinarians and veterinary technicians are en-gaged in the performance of \"small-business\" oper-ations or are employed by corporate veterinarymedical companies and are not gainfully employedby governmental entities. This community is ex-quisitely trained to perform preventive, medical,and surgical interventions but most do not have thetraining that is required for operating in a disastertheater, nor are they able to be self sustaining whennormal infrastructures are compromised. Thesecharacteristics combined with the risks and respon-sibilities of government and the training of orga-nized rst responders often leads to problems duringthe response phase of emergency management.These problems often stem from animal-focused rstresponders not understanding the approaches thatare employed by local jurisdictions to protect life,health, and property of rst responders and citizens,the accountability that is required across layers ofgovernment, and the inability to be self sustainingin an infrastructure-poor environment. National Incident Management System The National Incident Management System (NIMS)was established in the aftermath of the 2005 Hurri-canes, Katrina and Rita. These storms demon- Fig. 1. Average annual federal disaster declarations by decade.3 2 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSEMERGENCY MANAGEMENTstrated the need for a comprehensive approach for incident management that spans all levels of gov-ernment. NIMS provides the framework that al-lows all levels of government, the private sector, andnongovernmental organizations to respond to a di-saster in a cohesive and coordinated fashion withoutusurping local control of incident response. 7 A key component of NIMS is the Incident Com- mand System (ICS). The ICS is a managementsystem used for managing disaster response. It isorganized into 5 functional areas including com-mand, operations, planning, logistics, intelligence,and nance, and administration. 8Understanding ICS is a foundational concept that must be under-stood and adhered to by all involved as rst respond-ers. It is also important to recognize that thedecision to respond to a disaster is not solely anindividual decision. Individuals do not have theright to decide on their own that it is appropriate torush toward the scene of a disaster. The reason forthe decision not being up to the individual lies in thechaos that is created by the disaster and jurisdic-tional requirements to protect life, health, and prop-erty with the safety of the rst responder being thehighest priority. Self deployment puts the veteri-narian in a position of legal risk given that thestatutory protections afforded to rst responders donot apply to the self-deployed and professional lia-bility policies may not extend into the disaster the-ater. Many jurisdictions require people to becredentialed to participate in disaster response andthe absence of credentials may put the person atlegal risk. The self-deployed volunteer is also at adisadvantage from the perspective of having accessto resources that may be necessary to support them-selves and deliver veterinary medical care in theincident. This often results in the self-deployedvolunteer becoming an additional problem for thejurisdiction to deal with. An additional consider-ation is that all jurisdictions should have animal-focused emergency plans. A component of theseplans is a process for ensuring that animals arereunited with their owners. There are numerousanecdotal examples of self-deployed volunteers ei-ther intentionally or as a result of a lack of aware-ness of local plans, transporting animals out of thearea thereby excluding any potential for reunitingwith their owner. The process for deploying a rst responder or team depends on the level of government underwhich you are operating. In the case of a localresponse, the order or request to deploy will comefrom either the county judge, mayor, or their desig-nee. The process for deploying a state-level asset is more complicated and is described below. Theprocess depicted is based on the Texas model.Other states will be similar but there may beslight differences. 1. A request for assistance (ICS form 213) is developed at the local level by emergencyservices ofcers or ofce of emergency man-agement. Note, in Texas this is a State ofTexas Assistance Request (STAR) form andin other states the form may be designateddifferently as well. 2. In Texas, the STAR is reviewed by the District Disaster Committee to determinewhether regional resources capable of meet-ing the need may be available. 3. If not, the STAR (ICS 213) is sent to the State Emergency Operations Center where it is ei-ther approved or not. 4. State-level teams only deploy under a state- approved request (STAR). Resource The American Association of Equine Practitioners(AAEP) and its charitable arm, The Foundation forthe Horse, can also serve as resources. A networkof people, following the above protocols, is impor-tant; these two groups can help connect you withlike-minded, caring professionals in your area.The Foundation may also be able to provide nan-cial support during times of need, and its staff maybe able to assist with communicating your needs toother practitioners, industry partners, and suppli-ers, again, following the above protocols. The Foundation for the Horse also invites AAEP- member veterinarians in the United States andCanada to join its State & Provincial Equine Emer-gency & Disaster (SPEED) network. The SPEEDVeterinary Liaisons serve as disaster communica-tion liaisons. A major goal of this network is tofacilitate communications regarding urgent needs,longer-term needs, overall status, and where re-sources will be most useful for the wellbeing ofhorses, especially during times of disaster. For more information about the SPEED net- work or resources from The Foundation for theHorse or AAEP, please contact Keith Kleine atkkleine@aaep.org. Participating in Organized Emergency Response Veterinarians and veterinary technicians have sev-eral mechanisms for getting involved in emergencyresponse including participating as an agent of thejurisdiction in which they are responding, becominga member of a state-level team such as the TexasA&M Veterinary Emergency Team, OklahomaLarge Animal First Response Team, Florida SART,or the Louisiana State Animal Response Team, orbecoming a volunteer with a nongovernmental orga-nization such as the ASPCA, American Humane, orCode 3. Self-deployed volunteers were a signicant com- ponent of the 2017 Hurricane Harvey response.They no doubt saved human and animal lives, butthere are signicant disadvantages of being a self-deployed volunteer. The self-deployed sector is typ-ically fragmented and based on individual decisionsand standards. The level of training required is AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 3EMERGENCY MANAGEMENTalso an individual decision so people often go into situations for which they are not prepared. Theself-deployed volunteer is also typically not able tomount a self-sustainable response, nor are they fa-miliar with a jurisdiction's plans for managing theanimal component of response. The Texas A&MVET responds with the equipment and supplies tobe a completely self-supporting veterinary medicalunit for up to 5 days and have developed the mech-anisms of support that allow the team to be selfsufcient for extended periods. In the case of Hur-ricane Harvey this was a 21-day deployment. Theself-deployed volunteer may also not be cognizant ofthe risks they will face or the steps for mitigatingthe risks they will encounter. The reality is thatany of these may present an additional problem foran already-stressed community. Participating as an agent of a local jurisdiction is an additional way to assist as a rst responder.This approach is highly recommended and can beaccomplished through being written into a local ju-risdiction's emergency plan or via a Memorandum ofUnderstanding, Memorandum of Agreement, or anemergency contract. These all provide a recognizedrole and the ability to interact with and benet fromthe rest of the rst-responder community. Theyalso provide a measure of liability protection. Lia-bility protections will be discussed in a later session.Memoranda of Understanding should be carefullyconsidered and all aspects of the agreement, includ-ing reimbursement mechanisms and requirementsshould be thoroughly reviewed. State-level teams provide a mechanism for veter- inarians and veterinary technicians to participateas a rst responder. The Texas A&M VET providesthe deployable veterinary medical resource in thestate of Texas. Veterinarians may join the teamthrough participating in the Texas Veterinary Med-ical Reserve Corps (TVMRC). The TVMRC is rec-ognized at the state and federal level and is acomponent of the Medical Reserve Corps Systemorganized under the Department of Health and Hu-man Services at the federal level. Monthly trainingsessions and biannual exercise opportunities areprovided to ensure that members are prepared forthe rigors and risks associated with emergency re-sponse. They are also supported through a re-sponse and provided the tools with which to workand the support necessary to meet daily rst-re-sponder needs. The disadvantage is that deploy-ments may be lengthy with a 14-day deploymentbeing within the realm of possibility. Training Requirements The training requirements required of rst respond-ers is dependent on the type of response they will beinvolved in. This can range broadly depending onthe assigned missions. The basic requirement thatall rst responders must have is a basic understand-ing and certication in the National ResponseSystem, National Incident Management System(NIMS), and the ICS. This training is availableonline at https://training.fema.gov/nims/. 9 The courses that are typically required include the following: ICS-100: Introduction to the ICS ICS 200: ICS for Single Resources and InitialAction Incidents IS-700: National Incident Management Sys-tem, An Introduction IS800: National Response Framework, AnIntroduction Additional training may be necessary depending onthe functions associated with one's participation inemergency response. Conclusion Participating as a rst responder can be immenselyrewarding on both a personal and professional level.The authors strongly recommend that participatingin an organized fashion and recognize that there is alevel of structure and organization that will likely bevery different than what is experienced on a dailybasis. This structure and organization is designedwith safety as the highest priority, allows one torespond under the broad umbrella that is emergencyresponse, and provides a level of accountability de-signed to ensure that animals and their owners areappropriately reunited. 2. Emergency Planning Structure Emergency planning occurs across multiple layerswith individuals, businesses, and local, regional,state, and federal levels of government all needingemergency plans for their area of responsibility.The focus of this presentation is involvement at thelocal level, but a brief discussion of each of the levelslisted will be presented. Individuals Every family needs a plan that will allow the bestopportunity to protect the health and wellbeing of allfamily members including their animals. Individ-ual planning is also important for protecting theeconomic health of families. Business Emergency Plans Practice planning is covered in a different section, butall veterinary medical practices should develop emer-gency plans focused on protecting the health and well-being of staff, clients, protecting nancial investmentsmade in the practice, and allowing continuity of oper-ations in the face of an emergency or disaster. Local Jurisdictions All emergencies begin and end locally. This simplestatement implies a tremendous responsibility for lo-cal jurisdictions, elected ofcials, and employees.The planning effort is housed in the Ofce of Emer-gency Management. These ofces can range from a 4 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSEMERGENCY MANAGEMENTpart-time employee, an employee with additional du- ties, to a multi-person unit depending on the size of thejurisdiction. Animal-focused plans that are needed inall jurisdictions include emergency animal evacuation,rescue, veterinary medical support, mortuary manage-ment, and sheltering plans. Many emergency man-agers do not have animal-specic knowledge and maybe unaware of many of the nuances that must beconsidered when planning for owners. They may alsobe unaware of the implications of the human-animalbond and the nancial and cultural signicance ofagricultural species. The diversity of thought re-quired to achieve the best plan requires a diverse au-dience of planning participants including veterinarymedical professionals, extension agents, animal con-trol ofcers, animal sheltering and welfare organiza-tions, and representatives from agricultural entities. Regional Counties may elect to join and develop regionalemergency plans. This may be performed whentwo counties agree to support each other and involvemultiple counties organized into Councils of Govern-ments. Regional planning allows resources to bepooled to support larger-scale responses. State The responsibility for planning for animals at thestate level is typically ceded to Departments of Ag-riculture or Animal Health Regulatory Agencies.The Texas Animal Health Commission is the leadagency in Texas and is responsible for leading plan-ning efforts for both household pets and livestock. Federal The Federal Emergency Management Agency(FEMA) in the Department of Homeland Security isthe lead entity at the federal level. FEMA has del-egated part of this responsibility to the UnitedStates Department of Agriculture in the case of in-fectious diseases in agriculturally important speciesand Department of Health and Human Service inthe case of veterinary medical support. The Na-tional Guard also serves as a signicant federal re-source and has historically received missionassignments supporting animals. Types of Emergency Plans The two types of plans important to this discussionare operational and tactical plans. Operational plans link strategic or high-levelgoals with tactical plans. Protecting animalhealth and welfare is an example of a stra-tegic goal. O perational plans dene the mis- sions, objectives, and responsibilities of what theplan is to accomplish and who will be responsiblefor accomplishing each component. \"Who\" is of-ten dened as a department or agency ratherthan an individual. Operational plans shouldaddress animal evacuation, rescue, shelter, vet-erinary medical support, and carcass disposal ormortuary management. Tactical plans are focused on how missions willbe accomplished and how operations will beperformed. Tactical planning is critically im-portant to the animal-focused areas of emer-gency planning given the diversity of thestakeholders and the fact that few of thesestakeholders are directly involved as rstresponders on a daily basis. Tactical plansshould detail the approaches to be used foranimal evacuation, rescue, shelter, veterinarymedical support, and carcass disposal or mor-tuary management. Tactical plans for a spe-cic function should be developed prior to anincident and then reviewed and adjusted asdaily mission requirements evolve. Emergency Planning Process A complete discussion of the planning process is be-yond the scope of what can be provided in this presen-tation and proceedings. The following should beconsidered an overview discussion. The followingpoints of consideration should be addressed regardlessof which tactical plan is being developed. Hazards and Risks Identify the risks and hazards that have the po- tential to result in the need for emergency opera-tions. This analysis should be broad and includenatural disasters, including infectious diseasesmanmade or incited, incidents, and transportationaccidents. It can be helpful to categorize the haz-ard by likelihood and consequence. Animal Populations Identify the approximate number of each species. The American Veterinary Medical Association(AVMA) Pet Calculator provides an estimate of petpopulations based on the human population. 4It is important to note that the AVMA Pet Calculator pro-vides estimates for the horse population as well.The estimate that is provided is based on nationalaverages and may need to be adjusted for regionswhere horse ownership is more prevalent. It is im-portant to note that agricultural animals can be verydifcult to evacuate out of harm's way and also presentunique challenges during the response scenario. Available Resources A key part of the planning process is identifying resources that will or may be available for emer-gency response purposes. Resource categories toconsider include the following: Human resources: The diverse groups thatare necessary have been previously dis-cussed. The important consideration is to in-clude them in the planning process. Considerincluding personnel from the re departmentwhen working on a tactical animal rescue plan. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 5EMERGENCY MANAGEMENTFacilities: Most areas of animal-focused emergency response require some type of facil-ity. Many communities plan on using theirexisting animal shelters. The issue with thisapproach is that these typically are near ca-pacity and cannot accommodate the needscreated by a large-scale emergency or disaster.It is appropriate to consider using non-purposedesigned structures. The most commonly en-countered by the authors' team is live-stock show facilities. These can be used tosafely and humanely shelter large and smallanimals if appropriate biosafety and animalcontainment measures are factored into theplan. It is not typically recommended that veterinary practices be used as juris-dictional resources. The reasoning is that most communities cannot reimburse for associ-ated expenses and use of the practice representsa signicant nancial burden for the practiceowner. It also places the practice in a situationwhere they are basically providing for some an-imals at no cost while charging for those whoseowners are present. Tools of the trade: The analogy the authors'most often used when discussing this area isthat a reman would not be sent to an apart-ment re armed only with a garden hose. Thesame concept applies to animal focused emer-gency plans. Animal professionals, particu-larly veterinary medical professionals, arehighly trained. They will be most effectivewhen they have the tools of their trade. Operational Approach Think of this section as a cookbook. Dene the A to Z steps for performing whatever function beingplanned. Veterinary Medical Professional's Role Animal-focused emergency plans require the inputof people with knowledge of animal behavior, dis-ease prevention, animal welfare, nutrition, andveterinary medicine. The veterinary medical pro-fessional is the one professional area that has abroad knowledge of all these topics. Knowledge issorely needed, and investment of time and effort willyield a more effective response. The place to startis introducing yourself at the Ofce of EmergencyManagement. Most emergency managers arehighly compassionate, skilled, and dedicated to serv-ing people in the community. Planning Resources The planning process can be a daunting challenge.There are numerous resources that are available.One is the planning program available under theTexas A&M VET. Instructor-student teams thatwill travel to your community and assist in the plan-ning process will be provided. These teams typi-cally do most of the writing process and can typicallybring a plan to 90% completion within a 2-weekperiod. This service is available at no cost. EmailWesley Bissett at wbissett@cvm.tamu.edu if you areinterested. The Texas A&M VET also have plan-ning templates that you can access on the TexasA&M VET Web site. 17Additional resources are available from animal health agencies.18 3. Injuries and Illnesses Commonly Encountered in Disaster Response Introduction Disasters invariably impact animals in some man- ner. They may be displaced, injured, highlystressed, or have chronic or undetected diseasesworsen due to the stress of the situation or theinability of the owner to provide necessary medica-tions. The types of injuries, illnesses, and goals oftreatment vary with type of incident and the phaseof emergency response operations. The followingdiscussion is based on the experiences of the TexasA&M Veterinary Emergency Team across multipledeployments and tactical planning missions. Thephases of emergency response that will be discussedin this presentation include evacuation, rescue, vet-erinary medical operations, and emergency shelter-ing. The perspective of the presentation is from theview of veterinary medical professionals respondingon behalf of a local jurisdiction. Evacuation Pre-Incident Evacuation Evacuation of animals can be separated into two distinct timeframes; pre-incident and post-incident. Hurricanes provide the best example of a pre-incident evacuation. Weather forecasting providesforward-leaning information and the ability to movenonagricultural animals from an impact area to onethat is anticipated to be minimally impacted or notimpacted at all. Human evacuees can also beseparated into two distinct populations; the self evacuees and functional- and access-needs citizens . Jurisdictions have a statutory requirement for pro-viding for evacuation of household pets belonging tofunctional- and access-needs citizens. The lay-man's description of a functional- or access-needscitizen is someone who will need assistance from agovernmental entity to evacuate. There are manyreasons a person may fall into the category of afunctional- or access-needs citizen. These includehealth, economic, and self-mobility status. Thesescenarios may also indicate at least the potential fordifculties in accessing veterinary medical care forpets that will be evacuated. Animals may also besubdivided into two groups; household pets and live-stock. FEMA denes household pets as \"A domes-ticated animal, such as a dog, bird, rabbit, rodent, orturtle that is traditionally kept in the home for plea-sure rather than for commercial purposes, can travelin commercial carriers and be housed in temporary 6 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSEMERGENCY MANAGEMENTfacilities. Household pets do not include reptiles (except turtles), amphibians, sh, insects/arachnids,farm animals (including horses), and animals keptfor racing purposes.\" 19Livestock are dened in the Texas Agriculture Code as \"Livestock means cattle,horses, mules, asses, sheep, goats, llamas, alpacas,exotic livestock, including elk and elk hybrids, andhogs, unless otherwise dened.\" 20These are impor- tant distinctions given that it creates two classes ofanimals, one being household pets for which supportis required statutorily and associated costs associ-ated with this support is reimbursable during fed-erally declared events and the second is livestock forwhich support under the Stafford Act will likely belimited to indirect response efforts. The UnitedStates Department of Agriculture will usually pro-vide support through the USDA Livestock Indem-nity Program. The discussion means that veterinary medical support performed on behalf of a jurisdiction will belimited to household pets belonging to functionaland access needs citizens during the evacuationphase. The goals of this veterinary medical sup-port will likely be as follows: Identify household pets that are not healthyenough to withstand the rigors of evacua-tion. Animals that are not healthy enough toundergo evacuation create a second issue forjurisdictions in that there should be a plan forwhat will happen with these animals. Categorize animals' risk status. The Texas A&M VET recommends segregating animalsinto three categories.\u2014Low-risk: The animal is healthy and doesnot represent a risk for other animals beingevacuated, to human evacuees, or to the per-sonnel performing the evacuation.\u2014High-risk: The animal either due to a dis-ease or behavioral condition represents ahealth threat to rst responders and other an-imals and people being evacuated.\u2014At-risk: The animal is considered to be anelevated risk for contracting diseases from oth-ers. This may be the result of age or medicalconditions. Stabilizing animals being evacuated. This may involve treating a medical condition orpharmaceutically manipulating an animal'sbehavior. Performing external parasite control. This is performed to protect people, animals, equip-ment, and facilities. Medical conditions that may be encountered duringthis phase of response are the same as what wouldbe expected to be presented at a typical veterinarymedical practice. There is an increased likelihoodfor injuries associated with conflicts between ani-mals particularly if a jurisdiction does not have agood plan for segregating animals. If a person isbitten, the same rules regarding potentialrabies exposures apply. These rules are notwaved because of the disaster setting. Thisapplies across all phases of emergency re-sponse. Providing treatment for external para- sites will be helpful in limiting issues with theparasites establishing infections on other animalsbeing evacuated or \"setting up house\" in vehiclesused to transport animals to a receiving shelter. Post-Incident Evacuation Post-incident evacuation is dened as the evacua- tion of animals after the incident occurs and prior toa direct impact on the animals. Chemical plantexplosions and transportation accidents provide oneof the best examples of this type of evacuation.The issues discussed under pre-incident evacuationapplies to this period as well. The differences be-tween the two time frames are as follows: All species may be evacuated. Animals belonging to citizens other than thefunctional and access needs population may besupported. Evacuation will likely be hasty. The need for animal decontamination must beconsidered. The goals of post-incident evacuation are the sameas discussed above as are the conditions that can beexpected. If evacuation is performed because of anexplosion or other such event, behavioral changes,traumatic injuries, and ear injuries may be seen. Rescue Animal rescue operations may involve any speciesand the decision to intervene on an animal's behalfwill be made by the jurisdiction and rst respondersthat are on scene. A key point is understandingthat the safety of rst responders is always thehighest priority. The goals of veterinary medicalsupport during the rescue phase are as follows: Determine whether a rescue or recovery is ap-propriate.\u2014A rescue is appropriate if the animal's con-dition is survivable given the support that canbe provided in a disaster setting.\u2014A recovery is appropriate when the animal'scondition is not survivable given the supportthat can be provided in a disaster set-ting. Humane euthanasia is appropriate inthese cases. Stabilize the patient prior to rescue and pro-vide necessary care immediately after. Pharmaceutically intervene if necessary toprotect the health and life safety of the animaland rst responders. Provide animal-specic safety instructions torst responders. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 7EMERGENCY MANAGEMENTEnsure that rescue techniques do not create additional injury. Medical conditions that may be encountered duringthe rescue phase are typically traumatic injuriessuch as abrasions, lacerations, fractures, burns, andchemical exposures. The Texas A&M VET has alsofound that dehydration is a common nding. Thiscan occur even if the rescue is being performed infloodwaters. Animals will often not drink contam-inated waters associated with flood conditions.It is important to recognize that denitive resolutionof the injury or illness will not be performed duringrescue operations. The goal is to stabilize the pa-tient to the point that it can be safely rescued with-out making injuries and illnesses worse. Veterinary Medical Operations Veterinary medical operations is considered to bethe phase of emergency response where animals arebeing presented to the veterinary medical team.There are several different characteristics that aredifferent than normal practice experiences that areworthy of consideration. Most animals that are received will presentwithout owners. They may be delivered byanimal control ofcers, rescue groups, andgood Samaritans. This means that the ani-mals will not have normal historical ndingsand owner wishes into the decision-makingprocess cannot be factored in. It is impor- tant that the location from which the an-imal was rescued is documented. This is a key piece of information that is necessary forthe animal-owner reunion process. Many animals may be relatively normal withonly minor or pre-existing conditions. Euthanasia decisions may need to be made inthe absence of the owner. If responding as anofcially recognized component of the re-sponse, presented animals will be consideredas \"wards of the jurisdiction.\" Establish thejurisdiction's expectations on these types ofcounties. The Texas A&M VET has been in arange of situations from limiting treatment totriage and stabilization where serious condi-tions are not treated to those where the juris-diction wishes to do everything possible upthrough surgeries in order to save ani-mals. The position of the VET is that animalwelfare ultimately drives the decision-makingprocess. If a jurisdiction does not wish to pur-sue extraordinary measures, the goal becomeskeeping the animal comfortable until other op-tions are identied. In cases where it is nothumane to continue, and an owner is not avail-able to provide consent for euthanasia or hasnot been identied, concurrence of two veteri-narians is required before an animal will beeuthanized.The types of injuries that the authors have experi-enced during the deployments of the VET have var-ied with the type of disaster being responded to.A full discussion is beyond the scope of what can beprovided in these proceedings so an overview isprovided. High-Wind Events High-wind events such as hurricanes and tornadoes result in injuries that would be anticipated withhigh-velocity airborne debris impacting animals.Lacerations, puncture wounds, abrasions, soft-tissue injuries, and fractures are routinely encoun-tered. Ophthalmic injuries are common and earcanals may be packed with debris. Wildres Burns are the most common feature of this type of response. It is important to thoroughly evaluatehooves, paws, and udders as severe burns of thesestructures may result in chronic pain and lack ofproduction. This is particularly important in live-stock. Respiratory disease is a common nding aswell with conditions typically increasing in severityover several days. Veterans of multiple wildre de-ployments will often recommend salvaging byslaughter livestock that present immediately afterthe wildre if mild lameness or respiratory diseaseis noted. The reasoning is that these conditionstypically become much worse over 3 to 4 days.Dehydration is, as with most types of disaster, acommon nding. Floods Responding to floods has been the most common reason for deployment of the Texas A&M VET.The VET has encountered numerous animals withsubmersion injuries. Most of these have been live-stock. The authors' opinion is that more submer-sion injuries in large animals than small animalsbecause small animals are seen will either reach astructure of some sort that will allow them to get outof the water or unfortunately drown. Submersioninjuries may develop with less than 24 hours ofexposure. The authors' opinion is that this occursas a result of high bacterial and viral loads in flood-waters, velocity of flood w aters, and increased sed- iment rates. Thoughts are that these combine toresult in rapid damage of the epidermis. Sub-mersion injuries are characterized by pittingedema and devitalization of the skin. These canbe exceptionally challenging to treat given thatthese animals are very painful and susceptible tosecondary infections. The VET has also encoun-tered respiratory disease as a common secondaryillness as well. Working with animals that arerescued from floodwaters comes with a signicantrisk to rst responders. Animals should be de-contaminated and personnel should wear personalprotective equipment. 8 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSEMERGENCY MANAGEMENTGastrointestinal disease is also a common nding in flood impacted waters. Floodwaters are, as noted earlier, very contaminated. Bacterial and vi-ral loads are typically elevated and waters often alsocontain a variety of toxic substances. Explosions Explosions result in similar issues as noted in high- velocity wind events. Additional issues that havebeen commonly encountered are ruptured ear-drums. Pain management is a critical feature insuccessfully dealing with these cases. Emergency Animal Sheltering The conditions encountered while providing veteri-nary medical support for emergency animal shelter-ing operations are very similar to what is typicallyfound in practice. There will be animals withchronic diseases and conditions that must be man-aged. Animals may decompensate due to the stressof being in an unusual environment. Stress-induced diarrheas are also a common nding. It isimportant to establish biosecurity measures to limitthe spread of disease to other animals and people. Conclusion Serving as a rst responder is the most profession-ally rewarding aspect of one author's (W.B.) 21-yearcareer. It can be difcult and dangerous. It isexhausting. The key to responding well is to do soaccording to a tactical plan that has been developedwith the risks and animal populations that are inyour area in mind. 4. Decontamination, Triage, Field Euthanasia Decisions, and Other Important Veterinary Rolesin the Disaster Environment Decontamination (Decon) Natural disasters and emergencies are an all too frequent increasing reality of daily life. Disastersituations often result in the intentional or uninten-tional release of hazardous materials into the envi-ronment. The Agency of Toxic Substances andDisease Registry estimates that in 2012 more than15,000 chemical incidents occurred in the UnitedStates. 2In addition to industrial accidents, disas- ters such as the World Trade Center terrorist at-tack, Hurricanes Katrina, Maria, Harvey, Michael,Florence, and Dorian, and the multiple wildreevents in the Western United States have all re-sulted in the release of hazardous materials into theenvironment. In addition to the debris left behind,destruction of buildings in any disaster can result inthe release of asbestos, polycyclic aromatic hydro-carbons, metal compounds, dioxins, and volatile or-ganic compounds liberated in the wreckage. Theflooding associated with the multiple major hurri-canes of recent years has led to the mixture of haz-ardous materials from damaged chemical plants,petroleum rening facilities, and commercial estab-lishments into the environment, not to mention justthe waste present from sewers and waste waterfacilities that is released/mingled into the floodwa-ter. In each of these situations, the introduction ofhazardous materials into areas that were occupiedby survivors, S&R teams, and resident animals cre-ated a signicant risk to human and animal health. Animals (both companion and large animals) that are impacted by disasters are frequently exposed tothese hazardous materials. In some cases, the con-taminants are primarily external (e.g., as is thesituation where horses are rescued from a contami-nated environment where they have been standingin flood water). However, internal decontamina-tion is also a very real concern for all animals res-cued from a disaster environment as internalizationof contaminates, from drinking contaminated wateror eating contaminated foodstuffs, or through ab-sorption or inhalation of hazardous substances (e.g.,from smoke or chemical releases). Regardless oftype, the presence of contaminants may result inpotential serious or life threatening health compli-cations. To mitigate the exposure and potentialhealth consequences from contaminant exposure,decontamination (particularly external) is a criticalstep in disaster response activities on behalf of ani-mals. This is also essential to the health and safety of humans who will be handling and caringfor them, and for the prevention of contaminationof their shelter and future home environments.It is important to identify the types of contami-nants that may be involved. Hazardous Materialspecialists tasked to the deployment are excellentsources for guidance on decontamination ap-proaches and requirements for personal protectiveequipment requirements. An additional resourceis WebWiser/H23040 . WebWiser is a web-based program provided by the National Library of Medicine andis an excellent tool for identifying and nding outmore information on chemical contaminants. It isavailable at https://webwiser.nlm.nih.gov/. Decontamination is the process of removing con- taminants from people, animals, equipment, struc-tures, and the environment (Kumar et al, 2010).Decontamination protocols are devised to eliminateexposures to hazardous materials and reduce thespread of contamination. While decontaminationis utilized to reduce human and animal exposure tosurface (skin/coat) contaminants, there are manychallenges associated including efcacy, safety, andmethods of decontamination. There are anecdotalprotocols that are designed for veterinary clinics anddisaster situations based on a single contaminantincident. In current literature, animal decontami-nation protocols are based on the basic principles ofleading animals through multiple stations that in-volve the removal of contaminated articles (collars,halters, other removable wearables), washing andrinsing the animal, and nally drying and perform-ing a veterinary evaluation. These decontamina-tion practices are the recommended practice for both AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 9EMERGENCY MANAGEMENTlarge- and small-animal incidents for a vast range of chemical, biological, and radioactive exposures. Decontamination procedures use both gross de- contamination and technical decontamination tech-niques. It is important to recognize that harmfuleffects of some contaminants is exacerbated by wa-ter and dry contamination is required. When a wetdecontamination is appropriate, gross decontamina-tion removes the majority of surface contaminationby using large amounts of water to rinse off looseparticles from the animal's coat. This stage ac-counts for the bulk removal of the contamination.Technical decontamination is a multi-step processthat encompasses a detailed removal of the hazard-ous material from all external aspects of the ani-mal's body. Methods utilized include \"brushing,vacuuming, and washing, to eliminate the contami-nant from the animal;\" however, in reality, washingremains the primary method by which materials areremoved. In short, technical decontamination is anextensive process and may require repeating stepsto ensure the complete removal of the hazardousmaterials or toxic agents. Historically, liquid dishsoap has been the agent of choice for external tech-nical decontamination. The physical propertiesfound in liquid dish soap allow for binding and emul-sication of particles and particularly oily sub-stances that may bind or attach to the oils of theskin and hair follicles (Heyer, 2011). Other agentssuch as hypochlorite solutions and chlorhexidine so-lutions have been utilized for biological decontami-nation, but have the drawback of time dependencyand inactivation. Hypochlorite solution typicallyrequires 15 minutes and chlorhexidine requires 6minutes of contact time with the skin to effectivelydenature biological agents (Heyer, 2011). In addition, to the selection of soaps and setting up procedures for individual decontamination ofhorses rescued from a disaster environment, there isa critical need to consider the protection of the per-sonnel performing the decon (personal protectiveequipment), protection of the environment from thecontaminants (collection of waste water\u2014itself a po-tentially massive volume), and need for a potentiallyvery large number of personnel needed to completethe decon process (given a maximum time in per-sonal protective equipment of 20 to 30 minutes intemperatures greater than 75\u00b0F, and a minimum of3 personnel needed for each horse (1 person forrestraint and 2 for washing, lathering, and rinsing).Finally, while data on water usage and time fordecon procedures in horses is lacking, if one extrap-olates from canine data, it will likely require morethan 15 to 20 gal/horse and a minimum of 20 to 25minutes per horse, thus making decontamination ofa large number of horses in a disaster event ex-tremely time consuming, personnel intensive, andrequire a large volume of fresh water (at least pota-ble), which may be at a premium in a disaster.These data are not given to overwhelm, and it isrecognized that veterinarians should not be thesource of manpower for these procedures, but veter-inarian oversight is critical, and the potential needfor pharmaceutical restraint for those horses thatare unruly or fearful, is a signicant reality. Triage in a Disaster Environment Providing veterinary medical care during emer-gency or disaster situations is very different thanthe typical practice day for the following reasons: The number of injured or ill animals beingbrought to the veterinary medical facility maybe much greater than the typical dailycaseload. Animals will likely be presented by a rescuerrather than their owner. The owner may be unavailable to participatein decision making. The ownership status of the animal may oftenbe unknown. Your facility may not be available or may beoperating without the normal resources(power, water, ability to resupply, personnelshortages). Evacuation of animals to veterinary medicalfacilities capable of providing denitive caremay be unavailable for many days or longer. Resources such as pharmaceuticals, supplies,and animal food may be scarce and difcult toreplenish. The issues identied above require that groundrules be set. In order to prevent a misunderstand-ing the veterinarians involved in the local animaldisaster group (e.g., CART, VMRC, or other localgroup) need to know what the resources and expec-tations are for dealing with animal issues. For ex-ample, when the Texas A&M VET deploys into anarea, county ofcials are asked how aggressive theywant the veterinarians to be in providing veterinarymedical care, develop the animal evacuation chain,and discuss with shelter partners the types andnumbers of injuries they are prepared to providecontinued care for. It has been the authors' expe-rience that county ofcials understand the impor-tant role that animals play in their constituent'slives and that sheltering partners are prepared toprovide substantial continued veterinary medicalcare. However, each disaster and local resourcesare different, requiring clear lines of communicationand expectations that are set early. It is also important to set the triage rules early in the deployment. Triage means literally \"to sort\"and is a critical process in the management of ani-mals impacted by a disaster. An excellent discus-sion of triage is provided in \"Veterinary DisasterResponse\" and is considered required reading forveterinarians and veterinary technicians wishing toparticipate in emergency response (Wingeld, 2009).The authors' team uses a slightly different systemthat is divided into eld triage and veterinary med- 10 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSEMERGENCY MANAGEMENTical triage, and providing veterinary medical triage for injured or ill animals (whether they are large orsmall animals) is the focus. In most circumstances, eld triage will be pro- vided by rst responders deployed to the emergencyor disaster\u2014this may include law enforcement oranimal control ofcers, but it also can consist ofother search and rescue organizations or humanegroups. This mix of professional responders resultsin a wide variation in accuracy of eld triage cate-gorization especially early in deployments. Thesystem that the authors employ and recommend ineld triage is very similar to that provided in Vet-erinary Disaster Response (Table 1). 5. Field Triage The system that the Texas A&M VET has used isbased on partnerships and the ability of the rstresponders to rescue animals requiring veterinarymedical care or, in cases where rst responders pri-mary mission or animal temperament preclude res-cue, reporting animal locations to animal controlofcers so that they can make the rescue. Thissystem has generally worked very well, but, if res-cues are made, it is critical that accurate rescuelocation be provided either in the form of a physicaladdress, GPS coordinates, or both so that the animalhas a greater chance of being reunited with its own-ers. In addition, it is imperative that the veteri-nary medical strike team recognizes the need for ashort-term, nite response time and capacity so thatthe resources provided by local veterinarians do notimpose an undue burden of time or expense on thosebusinesses. In general, for planning and recoverypurposes, the local animal response group (thesegroups are typically a combination of veterinarians,technicians, animal caretakers and others with an-imal handling experience) should only make plansfor veterinary medical operations to last 48 to 72hours. Local veterinary medical operations thatexceed this time frame should trigger a discussion ofthe need for requests for additional assistance forthe county, either in the form of requests for stateveterinary medical assistance (e.g., other state-sponsored teams) or for 501c3 nonprot agencieswith animal issues/veterinary expertise.6. Veterinary Medical Triage and Euthanasia For most veterinarians and veterinary technicians, this aspect of emergency response is instinctive andnatural\u2014particularly for those who have worked inclinical practice and handled emergencies. How-ever, while a practice may be well equipped and ableto provide a high level of veterinary care to animalsin a disaster, there are limits to what can be pro-vided in a disaster setting that must be understood.These are limits in personnel, limits in resources(particularly drugs or other more expensive items),limits in time that can be devoted to an individualanimal's plight, and limits in space (or ability tohouse, treat, or provide hospital care) for animals\u2014each of these limits may require a triage decisionthat may not necessarily be considered ideal, but isessential for the greater good. For example, ani-mals with severe lacerations that may be handledwith wound management, antibiotics, and painmeds, can be successfully managed versus thosethat require an extensive surgical manipulation torepair. All members of the team must be able todiscuss these decisions, and when disagreement ispresent, it is reasonable to have a hearing of allopinions, but ultimately, a nal decision (triage)must be given. In all cases where euthanasia isrecommended, a second conrmatory opinion mustbe agreed to\u2014both for the health of the team and itscohesiveness, but also for the best interests of theanimal's welfare, and the owner who may somedayask what happened. All euthanasia decisions andmethods follow the AVMA Euthanasia Guidelinesfor euthanasia decision making as well as for meth-ods. The latest version of the 2020 Euthanasiaguidelines are currently available and are a keyresource to keep close at hand: both for euthanasiadecision making in a disaster setting for appropriatemethods, but also for essential processes in situa-tions where no owner is present. There are several important aspects of medical triage, but key among them are good observationskills, excellent physical exam skills, and an abilityto think and work quickly in an austere environ-ment. The key to veterinary triage working well ina disaster setting is having cohesive, well-function-ing teams. Strike teams of four or ve individu-als\u2014typically a veterinarian, 1 to 2 technicians, and1 to 2 assistants (often lay persons)\u2014these teamsare critical to a triage unit, as the veterinarian canmove quickly from one animal to another, whiletechnicians are able to perform necessary treatmenttasks and assistants are available to restrain, recordinformation in the medical record, or assist in otherways as needed. In a disaster, in order for theresponding veterinary unit to be reimbursed fortheir supplies, drugs, and medical treatment given, there must be an excellent record of everythingused. These records are as essential to the triageprocess as the act itself, as they will be necessary notonly for helping to connect the animal back to itsTable 1.

Human Critical Incident Stress (HCIS) What is critical incident stress? It is any eventoutside the usual realm of human experience that ismarkedly distressing and exceeds normal copingmechanisms. But, importantly, it is the individualthat denes what \"their\" critical incident or event is.An incident that one may be able to easily cope withmay noticeably affect another individual. All re-sponders are exposed to critical incidents or stres-sors during deployments or while responding todisasters, so it is important to recognize and developteam and individual support systems and copingmechanisms for any and all people involved in di-saster response. This is a key reason for teambased response, as individuals who are self-deployedvolunteers or those who do not have a team of peoplearound them can be particularly vulnerable or haveno support structures around them. Critical incidents can range from any serious in- jury, death, or illness seen by a responder, whetherit is someone they know or not, but it is absolutelynot necessary that situation be personal\u2014being in-volved in terrorism, responding to incidents withmany affected animals or people, or both, and situ-ations where there is a personal connection (loca-tion, situation involving people of similar ages orwith children, responding when personally impactedby the event, etc). The bottom line is this: anyevent can trigger an emotional or stress response,even when prepared for it. There are many types of symptoms such as phys- ical, cognitive, behavioral, and emotional that canvary widely in severity from mild to extreme debil-itation or dysfunction. The most common cognitivesymptoms are nightmares, poor attention or prob-lem solving/concentration, intrusive images, but anynew or unusual symptoms may occur. Emotionaland behavioral symptoms can range from fear, guilt,and grief to irritability, anger, depression or emo-tional outbursts\u2014to withdrawal, inability to rest,increased use of alcohol or changes in social behav-ior\u2014and each of these may occur immediately afterthe event to weeks or months later. The key is tounderstand and recognize that these are NORMALpeople having NORMAL responses to a very AB-NORMAL situation. It is also important to recog-nize that HCIS is NOT: 1) for those who \"can't takeit\", 2) a sign of weakness, 3) counseling or psycho-therapy, or 4) a critique of the response to the event.The approach to management of HCIS is educationin awareness of this type of stress response, theimportance of debrieng after an event, understand-ing how to defuse the feelings and where to nd thesupport needed, such as friends, clergy, fellow re-sponders, family, and professional CISM personnel.Defusing and debrieng through the use of peercounselors and mental health specialists, peoplewho understand this work and what the veterinar-ian is experiencing, in any response are a key rststep in the transition from being a rst responder inaction and returning to normal activities. This isparticularly important for those who don't responddaily or weekly, such as veterinarians who leavetheir practice life to respond to a disaster on anoccasional basis. Without exception, debriengand defusing should only include those directly in-volved in the incident, are condential, are safe (peo-ple who responders trust) and nonjudgmental.Defusing, which occurs immediately post event (12to 24 hours) allows for symptom mitigation and de-brieng, which occurs 24 hours to 4 weeks post eventto facilitate psychologic closure, mitigation, andidentication of those needing intervention follow-ing an event are the bandages that stop the psychefrom bleeding. They are emotional rst aid after atraumatic event or sequence of events. The processis designed to provide opportunities to vent thetrauma and learn ways to cope, while also providingfollow-up and help if needed. Self care is a very important part of developing skills to help survive critical incidents and the stressthey bring. It is crucial to keep work, play, andstress balanced and in control. It is also importantto be aware of HCIS symptoms. Other helpful keysare to maintain good nutrition and schedules, in-cluding exercising regularly and getting rest. Oneof the most important things to remember is that itis each person's responsibility to themselves, theirfamily, and the people and animals that are beinghelped to \"remain in the game\" by staying healthy.In addition, it is also as important to look out forpartners and other team members (\"battle buddies\")and help point them toward help when needed. 8. Developing an Emergency Plan for Your Practice: The Importance of Personal, Practice, and LocalPreparedness Supplemental Information and Details on Planning The Texas A&M VET has been involved in emer- gency preparedness and response since 2009 andhas deployed to most of the disasters that haveoccurred in the state of Texas since that time. Eachdeployment has provided real-life examples of howveterinary practices and hospitals are threatened byone of the following: Direct damage to hospital or clinic with poten-tial for injuries to patients, clients, or staff. Financial losses associated with non-reim-bursement of response associated costs. Reduced future income potential associatedwith loss of client base. Future client basemay be also be lost due to client fatalities,victims moving out of the impact area, orchanges in client's nancial status in the post-disaster environment. 12 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSEMERGENCY MANAGEMENTThe key to successfully navigating a disaster that impacts the practice or community is to commit todeveloping a practice or hospital emergency and con-tinuity of operations plan. This is a deliberate pro-cess that should consider the types of disasters thatoccur, and the variety of hazards present in eachpractice and the community. It is helpful to sepa-rate the types of disasters into no-notice versusthose incidents in which advance notice of an im-pending event is provided. No-notice event: These can be separated intothose incidents that are clinic-centric and inci-dents in which the incident is external to theclinic or practice.\u2014Clinic-centric: The best example of a clinic-centric incident is a re involving a practice'sstructure.\u2014External to clinic: Examples include flash-flooding, explosions, wildres, and torna-does. The Texas A&M VET has been involvedin responses to each of these types of incidents. Advance-notice event: The best example ofan advance notice event is a hurricane or win-ter storm. Weather forecasters monitor forthese systems and provide advance warningfor a signicant amount of time prior to ar-rival. This provides the opportunity to miti-gate risks associated with the impendingincident. Developing a Clinic or Hospital Emergency Plan The following discussion will provide an overview ofthe process for developing an emergency plan forveterinary medical practices or hospitals. This is acomplex process and a full discussion is beyond thescope of what can be provided in these proceedings.There are multiple resources available to provideguidance you through the process. 8-12 Dene Your Practice The initial step in developing an emergency practiceplan is to fully dene the practice. This may seemcounterintuitive, but it is easy to overlook key is-sues. Addressing the following issues or areas willallow you to have an accurate representation of thepractice. Personnel and clients: Identifying these twopopulations will identify the number of peoplewho may respond on behalf of the practice andthe number of non-employees for whom thepractoce has the responsibility of providing fortheir safety. A third population to considerincorporating into the planning process is ex-ternal contractors who provide specic servicesfor the practice on a contractual or as-neededbasis. Patients: The number of out-patient and hos-pitalized animals should be calculated. Theauthors prefer basing this on maximum capac-ity as it prepares the practice to deal with theworst-case scenario. Data information system: Identify the sys-tems used for management of patient records,nancial accountability, and maintainingother important information such as employeerecords and insurance papers. The authorsprefer electronic systems that are either cloudbased or have an automated off-site backupfeature. Equipment: Develop a list of all equipmentand include brand, serial numbers, date of pur-chase, purchase price, and place of pur-chase. It can be helpful to keep photographsof equipment as well. List of resources that are available to be usedas emergency response assets. This particu-lar point is inward facing and intended to iden-tify resources that may be used to respond onbehalf of the practice rather than resourcesthat may be used to respond as an agent of alocal jurisdiction. Pharmaceutical and medical supply inventory:This inventory is rarely static and varies dayto day. Electronic inventory systems providethe ability to maintain inventory awareness ona \"real-time\" basis, particularly when they arepart of the medical records system. Contact information: Maintain a current listof emergency and service provider num-bers. This should include law-enforcementagencies, regulatory agencies, and the Ofce ofEmergency Management. As-built drawings for owned buildings: Thesewill be helpful if a practice is damaged or de-stroyed because of an emergency or disasterincident. Financial projections for maintaining the li-quidity of the practice based on pre-incidentconditions. Identify Risks Risk identication or hazards analysis is a key com-ponent to developing an emergency plan for veteri-nary practices. It involves identifying those risksthat are inherent in the vicinity of the practice.This process should include man-made and naturaldisasters, with infectious disease incidents being in-cluded under natural disasters. Man-made eventsmay be classied as technological (power outages,chemical releases) or intentional (Terror attacks,mass shootings and other deliberate actions). It isimportant to include transportation accidents giventhe number of animals and volume of hazardousmaterials that are transported on highway and railsystems. It is also advisable to contact local juris-diction's Ofce of Emergency Management as theywill know of hazards that many may not be aware of.It may also be helpful to separate the risks into thefollowing categories; those that are limited to thepractice (e.g., structure res) and those that have a AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 13EMERGENCY MANAGEMENTbroader distribution (e.g., wildre, tornado, hurri- cane, winter weather, flooding). Communications Plan This plan should be separated into two areas, inter-nal and external. Internal communications plan-ning will involve detailing how all owners, employees, and other identied human resourcesmay be quickly contacted when there is an impend-ing incident or one that has just occurred. This cantake a variety of different forms from a telephonecalling tree to a group text message. The desiredoutcome is to have everyone communicated within amanner that gets everyone on scene or evacuatedquickly without individually tying up key personnelthat may be needed for other purposes. There should also be a plan for communicating with animal owners. It is often preferable to dis-charge patients that can be safely discharged totheir owners in cases of advance-notice events.No-notice events, particularly those that directly im-pact the practice, will typically result in heightenedconcern in owners of hospitalized patients. Con-sider the role of social media and how it may be usedto broadly broadcast a message on the status of yourclinic, employees, and patients. It is also importantto have a plan on how the practice will monitor forand respond to negative or inaccurate social mediaposts. Identify Goals and How They Will Be Accomplished This will be the lengthiest section of the emergencyplan. A full discussion of all the goals is beyond thescope of what can be provided in these proceedingsand the following are provided as a starting point forthe emergency planning process. Life safety of employees and clients: This section should be given the highest priority and includeplans for performing an immediate evacuation of thepractice when the practice is threatened by inci-dents that are internal to the practice. Structureres are an example of these types of incidents.It should include information on how the evacuationprocess will be initiated and communicated to alloccupants. Primary and secondary meeting placeswill need to be identied so that all employees andclients can be accounted for immediately afterevacuation. Life safety should also be considered in longer- term events. One of the best examples is providedwhen veterinary practices continue to operate in thepost-disaster phase in the absence of normal sup-porting infrastructure. The post-hurricane envi-ronment provides a good example. Many hazardscan be part of the post-landfall timeframe includingdown trees, lack of electrical service, and structuraldamage. Protecting the health and wellbeing ofstaff and people that may come to a practice shouldbe planned for in an attempt to mitigate any risksthat may be present.Life safety of patients: This will receive the sec- ond highest priority. This section should be sepa- rated into no-notice and advance-notice events.Providing for the life-safety of patients in no-noticeevents is focused on getting patients out of the facil-ity as quickly as can be accomplished without intro-ducing unmitigated risks to human resources. Incidents for which advance notice is typically available provides more options. Discharging pa-tients whose condition allows will typically result inreduction of care provided by clinic personnel. Pa-tients that are not medically stable will requiremore advanced planning. It is appropriate to iden-tify colleagues that may be able to receive thosepatients that cannot be discharged. Owners shouldbe provided the opportunity to approve what casesthey will be transferred to. If they do not wish fortheir animals to be transferred to those identied asreceiving practices, then plans will need to be madeon how animals will be transferred to other points ofcare. No-notice events provide a different challenge than that discussed above in that patients may needto be evacuated at a moment's notice. The struc-ture re again provides the best example. Plan-ning includes accounting for the safety of personnelthat are evacuating patients, location to which pa-tients will be evacuated, and how they will be con-tained after evacuation. As in the discussionabove, thought needs to be invested in planning forwhere those patients requiring continued veterinarymedical care will go assuming the practice being evacuated is no longer viable. Pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and equip- ment represent a signicant investment and arecritical to the ability of a practice to continue oper-ations after disaster strikes. An evacuation planand storage plan for supplies and equipment needsto be developed in addition to the documentationdiscussed earlier in this paper. Preservation of important documents: This in- cludes medical records, nancial instruments,employee records, inventory information, and insur-ance policies. Electronic storage of these docu-ments in a cloud-based system or off-site server cansimplify this process. Continuity of Operations This is an exceptionally important area given therole veterinary practices play in providing employ-ment and service to communities. The reality isthat disaster scenarios typically cause negative con-sequences on a practice's business model. Theseconsequences include but are not limited to thefollowing: Direct damage to the veterinary practicestructure. Loss of key personnel. Reduced future client base. 14 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSEMERGENCY MANAGEMENTReduced disposable income for remaining clients. Some of these risks can be mitigated by hardeningthe practice when there is advanced notice of asevere-weather event and investing in emergencyelectrical generators. It will also be helpful to con-sider where a practice may be relocated if the cur-rent structure is destroyed or requires signicantrepairs. Monitoring of available lease space andhaving an established relationship with a real estateprofessional will provide the best opportunity forquickly relocating the practice. It is also good busi-ness to understand cash-flow requirements formaintaining current stafng levels. Disasters areanticipated to cause at least a temporary decline incash flow. It will be important to understand whento lower expenses so as to maintain the long-termpractice viability. An area that is often overlooked is planning for infectious disease. Infectious diseases that can dis-rupt practice activity are typically considered to bein the livestock realm given the number of regulateddiseases. The reality is that viruses and bacteriaare continuing to adapt and the appearance of anovel strain that potentially impacts other speciesand may be zoonotic are always possible. Canineinfluenza has, as of this writing, not been shown tocause clinical illness in people, but given the poten-tial for reassortments and genetic shifts or drifts,this is not outside of the realm of possibility. Plansidentifying how animals and people may be movedon and off the property without resulting in thespread of the disease in question can be developed.These must be developed in conjunction with theUSDA and state-level animal health regulatory or-ganizations. It is also helpful to dene how person-nel will be protected in cases where the disease inquestion is impacting human populations. Participating in Organized Emergency Response Planning for animals in disasters is still not where itneeds to be. The authors have worked with somecommunities that plan for the local veterinarians toplay a major role. This is something the authorssupport, but the reality is that most jurisdictionscannot pay for these services. This places the localveterinarian in the position of performing work forfree when there are no owners present and decidingif they will charge when an owner is available.It is recommended that practices dene how theywill participate and include nancial aspects in thisdecision. This should be discussed with the localjurisdiction. It is appropriate to dene the lengthof time to respond, nancial limits, and what thejurisdiction will do when these are exceeded. Conclusion Practice planning is beyond what can be fully dis-cussed in these proceedings. It is a complicatedprocess but fortunately, there are resources avail-able. The template available at the link in thefourth reference is excellent. The Texas A&MVET, rst reference, also has templates available.The VET can also bring instructor-student teams toassist in the process. This service is available at noto minimal costs. 9. Developing Emergency Plans for Animals at the Local Level Introduction As noted in earlier discussions, it appears that ad- verse weather conditions are occurring more fre-quently and becoming more severe. The last 2years have seen 800- and 1,000-year floods, landfallof a Category IV hurricane, and historic floodingfrom Wharton County, Texas, to the Louisiana Bor-der. Northern California has recently experienceddevastating wildres. There has been an activevolcano in Hawaii that destroyed homes and im-pacted rural areas. Numerous wildres in NewMexico, Colorado, and California, and flooding in theNortheast and Northwest have occurred as theseproceedings were being crafted. Each of these di-sasters are impacting thousands of people and ani-mals. Some of these communities have robustanimal-focused plans while others do not. Plan-ning for and responding on behalf of animals isalways a secondary priority at the local, state, andnational level with protection of human life andsafety appropriately receiving the highest priority.The two things learned from the numerous deploy-ments of the Texas A&M VET is that robust andwell-thought-out animal-focused tactical plansmake a signicant difference in of animal-focused response efforts andthat the highest-priority mission, providing for thehuman condition, cannot be fully accomplishedwithout providing for their animals. Emergency Preparedness Overview Emergency management consists of multiple phasesincluding mitigation, preparedness, response, andrecovery. 13This presentation is focused on the pre- paredness or planning phase and how the veterinarymedical professional is critical to successfullyachieving the desired outcome. FEMA has devel-oped the Developing and Maintaining Emergency Operations Plans Comprehensive PreparednessGuide (CPG) 101 to guide communities through the planning process. 14This document provides basic principles, discussed below, that are broadly appli-cable to all communities across the United States. \"Planning must be community-based repre-senting the whole population and itsneeds.\" Prior to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, animals were not a legislatively man-dated target of emergency planning. Thesetwo storms demonstrated the need for emer-gency planning for animals and federal legis- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 15EMERGENCY MANAGEMENTlation requiring inclusion of animals in emergency efforts passed.3 \"Planning must include participation from allstakeholders in the community.\" The stake- holder community for animal-related planningis an exceptionally diverse community rangingfrom pet owners, agriculturally based indus-tries, animal control ofcers, livestock ofcers,animal welfare groups, extension agents, andveterinary medical professionals. The level ofdiversity in this stakeholder group is increasedas compared to other planning areas. An ad-ditional complication is that some of the differ-ent stakeholder groups have diametricallyopposed thoughts and goals. \"Planning uses a logical and analytical prob-lem-solving process to help address complexityand uncertainty in potential hazards andthreats.\" The clinical problem-solving ap- proach employed by veterinary medical profes-sionals is ideally suited for emergencyplanning. \"Planning considers all hazards and threats.\"While the causes of emergencies can varygreatly, many of the effects do not. \"Planning should be flexible enough to addressboth traditional and catastrophic incidents.\" \"Plans must clearly identify the mission andsupport goals (with desired results.)\" \"Planning depicts the anticipated environmentfor actions.\" The environment in which emer- gency and disaster operations occurs is mark-edly different than that encountered on atypical day. Accounting for this difference iscritical in accounting for the safety of rst re-sponders and understanding what resourceswill likely be available. \"Planning does not need to start from scratch.\"Each stakeholder brings different skills andprotocols into the planning process. Theserepresent a starting point that allow plannersto not have to recreate the wheel. \"Planning identies tasks, allocates resourcesto accomplish those tasks, and establishes ac-countability.\" The important point here is that during a response, the animal-focusedtasks primarily focused on preserving thehealth and well-being of animals and main-taining their normal relationship with theirowners, is not that different from what practi-tioners do daily. The environment in whichone performs, however, can be vastly different. \"Planning includes senior ofcials throughoutthe process to ensure both understanding andapproval.\" This is a critically important point. The reality is that a veterinary medi-cal professional may be engaged under the typ-ical veterinarian: client relationship oracting as an \"agent\" of the jurisdiction. Act-ing as an agent of the jurisdiction requires anunderstanding that actions are being per-formed to accomplish the goals of the jurisdic-tion in a manner that they approve of. \"Time, uncertainty, risk, and experience influ-ence planning.\" The Texas A&M VET has been actively engaged in the planning processfrom the time of it's inception. The multipledeployments and joint planning efforts withjurisdictions have influenced the planning pro-cess. Being a responder makes for betterplanners and being a planner makes for betterresponders. \"Effective plans tell those with operational re-sponsibilities what to do and why to do it, andthey instruct those outside the jurisdiction inhow to provide support and what to expect.\" \"Planning is fundamentally a process to man-age risk.\" \"Planning is one of the key components of thepreparedness cycle.\" Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Authors have adhered to the Principles of Veter- inary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Introduction Radiography is a widely available diagnostic tool useful for assessing skeletal features associatedwith fractures, osteochondral fragmentation, osteo-arthritis, subchondral stress remodeling, bone pathologies (infection,neoplasia). High-quality radiographs provide sub-stantial skeletal information for the monetary andtime investments. However, it is important to re-member that radiographs are static images that con-vey morphologic but not functional (metabolic)information. Bone tissues are changing dynami-cally in response to mechanical and metabolic loads.The initial stage of injuries associated with repeti-tive activities is bone microdamage, which alone is not visible on radiographs. Consequently, bone tis-sue can be compromised without detectable radio-graphic abnormalities. Further, bone density mustchange considerably to be visible radiographically.Serial images or other image modalities (e.g., mag-netic resonance imaging [MRI]) may be needed toidentify developing lesions and assess the progres-sion of lesions (quiet, exacerbating, or resolving).It is acknowledged that published evidence on whichto base interpretation of the clinical signicance ofmany abnormalities is incomplete. 1However, given these caveats, abnormalities visible on radio-graphs are often useful for diagnostic, treatment planning, and prognostic purposes. 2. Changes Associated with Skeletal Adaptation and Injury In order to understand the usefulness and limita- tions of imaging techniques in racehorses, it is im-portant to have perspective on the skeletal adaptiveand pathologic processes and their manifestations for recognition in racehorses. Bones are heavy and energetically expensive during locomotion. Conse-quently, the skeleton is highly dynamic, continuouslyadding, removing, or replacing bone tissue for healthyskeletal function while minimizing energy expendi-ture. Specically, the skeleton strategically placesmineralized tissue in mechanically advantageous po-sitions depending on the most recent mechanical load-ing experiences. Essentially, horses are not bornwith racehorse skeletons. Training makes racehorseskeletons, ideally by causing skeletal adaptation tomeet competition needs without sustaining injury. Skeletal adaptation occurs in response to increas- ing and/or altered loads associated with race trainingand race training circumstances. Increases in factorssuch as horse speed and racetrack surface hardnessincrease loads and stresses on the skeleton. To ac-commodate greater loads the skeleton must lay down 18 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IMAGING FINDINGS AND LAMENESS NOTESadditional bone material. For long bones, this pro- cess is associated with deposition of bone on outercortical surfaces to enlarge bone cross-sectionalarea. 2,3The enlarged cross-sectional area reduces bone stresses and strains to within physiological lim-its. Further, the deposition of bone material on theperiphery of bones is mechanically advantageous forsustaining bending and torsional loads. 4 The rate of increasing exercise intensity (rate that increasing loads are applied to the skeleton overdays/weeks) affects the rate that the bone needs toadapt to the new circumstances. Ideally the rate ofincreasing exercise intensity is within the limitsthat stimulate bone formation with minimal boneperturbation. Under these circumstances high-quality lamellar bone tissue has time to be appliedto bone surfaces. If the rate of increasing exerciseintensity exceeds the level bones can sustain, sub-stantive bone damage is created. A rapid responseto attempt to buttress a weakened bone structurecaused by substantive bone damage results in lesserquality woven bone tissue, which can be formedrapidly, to be deposited on bone surfaces. Ulti-mately, woven bone is replaced by lamellar bonetissue when time and loading circumstances allow.These different responses are indicators of bonehealth and bone disturbance\u2014and have distinguish-ing features on images. Specically, lamellar boneis dense, homogeneous, and has a smooth surface.Woven bone is porous, heterogeneous, and has anirregular surface (Fig. 1). Bone adaptation and bone injury are at the sepa- rate ends of an analog scale. Submicroscopic andmicroscopic level bone perturbation stimulate boneadaptation, and is resolved with changes in bonegeometry consistent with bone adaptation. Mi-crodamage that causes local bone tissue injury stim-ulates bone repair in addition to bone deposition.The focus of microdamage is rst resorbed by oste-oclasts, which transiently weakens the bonematerial. However, given appropriate (reduced)exercise intensity to prevent further damage on aweakened structure, osteoblasts rell the resorptionspaces with secondary osteons. Secondary osteonsnot only replace damaged bone tissue, but enhanceproperties that resist crack propagation in bone ma-terial. Several features of these processes are rel-evant to image interpretation. Focal regions ofosteopenia are related to intermediary steps in theprocess of repairing a burden of microdamage intissue. These regions are weakened bone tissue,which can serve as sites of fracture initiation underotherwise normal training and racing circum-stances. These focal osteopenic sites can be ob-served on morphologic images as incomplete corticalstress fractures or as subchondral lesions. Becausebone tissue is capable of regeneration, after rehabil-itation the prognosis for return to performance isexcellent given that there are no adverse sequelaesuch as collapse of articular cartilage over a sub-chondral osteopenic lesion. Equine athletes in the occupation of racing are sus- ceptible to incurring substantive bone damage in theform of overuse injuries. Racing related overuse in-juries are due to the repetitive motions incurred dur-ing training- and race-specic loading conditions.These specic loading conditions result in predictablesites, natures, and congurations of injuries in race-horses. Knowledge of the sites and features of com-mon, typical injuries aids in the selection of clinicaldiagnostic and imaging techniques. 3. Stress Fractures Radiographs are useful for stress fractures in thedistal portion of the limb because of the relativelyscant soft tissue relative to bone tissues. Stressfractures are associated with the intracortical re-modeling of microdamaged bone material. Whendamage resorption exceeds bone tissue replacementduring the process of healing, the affected regionbecomes osteopenic\u2014and may be recognized on ra-diographs. Focal periosteal woven bone callus andendosteal sclerosis serve to buttress the underlyingweakness. The visualization of these features, re-gardless of the presence or absence of a radiolucentincomplete fracture line are indicative of an under-lying stress fracture. With progression of intracor-tical healing, the size of the callus diminishes andthe callus surface becomes smoother with conver-sion of woven bone to lamellar bone through theremodeling process. A residual increase in bonediameter at this location reflects skeletal adaptationto the new loading conditions (Fig. 1). The mostcommon sites for radiographic detection of corticalstress fractures are the third metacarpal bone, tibia,and proximal phalanx. Some stress fractures canbe detected in the humerus. 4. Stress Remodeling Stress remodeling occurs in subchondral bone sites.The features of stress remodeling are similar tothose of stress fractures with the exception of thelack of a periosteal response due to the overlying Fig. 1. Lateromedial radiographs of a developing and resolved stress fracture at the humeral neck. A, Early clinical signs-noabnormalities. B, 1-month later - focal periosteal woven bonecallus. C, 3-months later - lamellar cortical expansion. Rick Arthur. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 19IN-DEPTH: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IMAGING FINDINGS AND LAMENESSarticular cartilage. Accumulation of microdamage in regions of high stress devitalizes bone material.The devitalized bone material must rst be removedbefore it can be replaced with new healthy bonematerial. During this process, the microdamageand focal osteopenia weaken the bone substance.Given time and early recognition, the lesion canheal. Continued exercise on the weakened tissuecan culminate in cartilage collapse. Rec-ognition of the subchondral lucency before articularfracture or cartilage collapse is most commonly ob-served in the third metacarpal and carpal bones(Fig. 2). 5. Complete Bone Fractures The most straightforward diagnoses involve com-plete, displaced fractures. Indications for repairand prognoses for healing and return to perfor-mance are related to the presence/reconstruction ofa weight-bearing bone column and articular involve-ment/reconstruction. Relatively few longbone diaphyseal fractures that completely separatethe proximal and distal portions of the bone columnare amenable to successful repair. The likelihoodof success increases when implants reconstruct thebone column so that the bones can sustain loads.The likelihood of return to performance is higherwith non-articular fractures and with anatomicallyreduced articular fractures without associated sub-chondral bone pathology. 6. Third Metacarpal/Metatarsal Condylar Fractures Complete, displaced or non-displaced articular frac-tures commonly affect the third metacarpal/meta-tarsal condyle and the third carpal bone. Condylarfractures more commonly affect the lateral than themedial condyle. Complete lateral condylar frac-tures usually exit the lateral side of the metacarpalcortex, thus leaving intact a column of bone from theproximal to distal articular surfaces. Medial con-dylar fractures have a likelihood progress-ing proximally, resulting in complete, comminutedmetacarpal/metatarsal fractures; however, success-ful repair can return horses to racing performance. 5 Condylar fracture initiation occurs in the sub- chondral bone of articular surface.6The frac- ture propagates variable amount proximally,resulting complete fractures, non-displaced and displaced congurations. Conse-quently, all condylar fractures will have an articularcomponent, and incomplete fractures will be presentin the subchondral bone. Condylar fractures arecommonly associated with subchondral bone pathol-ogy that can manifest as a focal subchondral radio-lucency or as an osteochondral fracture fragment(articular comminution) at the distal aspect of thefracture on the palmar aspect of the condyle (Fig. 2).Prognosis for return to racing performance is betterfor nondisplaced fractures than displaced fractures. 7 Prognosis of incomplete fractures for return to rac-ing performance is good with conservative or surgi-cal treatment; 87% of conservative, 74% of surgicalreturned per- cent (63%) of all condylar fractures treated to racing performance, includingsuccessfully repaired medial condylar fractures.Prognosis for return to racing was adversely affectedby severe joint injury, articular comminution, 6and less than optimal surgical repair.5 High-quality for detecting incomplete lateral condylar fractures, articular com-minution, and evidence of subchondral bone abnor-malities that portend impending lateral condylarfracture.

Palmar/Plantar Osteochondral Disease Palmar/plantar osteochondral disease (POD) is verycommon in racehorses that have died or were eutha-nized during racing or training. POD lesions havebeen observed during postmortem examination in44% to 67% of racehorse limbs. 11-13These lesions have been associated with a history of greater num-ber of lifetime races and shorter inter-race intervals,typical of cumulative race exposure and trainingintensity. 14POD lesions have been associated with other pathologies within the fetlock joint; increasingseverity of POD is associated with increasing prev-alence/severity of other lesions. 12,15POD is consid- ered a fatigue injury of subchondral bone that isrecoverable in early stages of disease, but can prog-ress to articular cartilage collapse and irreversibledegenerative joint disease.

Proximal observed in 2-year-old training sale Thor-oughbred racehorses were less likely to race and earnmoney. 17Removal of apical fractures in horses is associated with good return to racing and career lon-gevity, however, there is a better prognosis forhindlimb (86%) than forelimb (55%) fractures, 47%raced postoperatively). 18,19Size of the apical fracture fragment not observed to affect racing progno-sis. 20Uniaxial transverse PSB fracture repaired with lag screws resulted in 5 of 8 horses without con-current degenerative joint disease returning toracing. 21 9. Sesamoiditis Evidence for signicance of sesamoiditis relative toracing performance is controversial. Whereassome studies observed that enlarged vascular chan-nels with non-parallel borders adversely affectedracing performance, others using different criteriafor sesamoiditis found no relationship. 17,22,23The observed relationships characterized sesamoiditisas the presence of vascular channels /H110222 mm width and abnormal or non-parallel sides. Thirty percent(30%) of severely affected horses raced at 2 years ofage and 70% at 3 years of age compared to 51% and79% of non-affected horses racing at 2 and 3 years ofage respectively. Forelimb proximal sesamoid frac-ture in 2-year-old in training sales were associatedwith a lower proportion of horses starting a race(57% affected vs 82% non-affected; 71% vs 91%, re-spectively); however, if yearling horses started in arace there were no differences in places, moneyearned, or money earned per start. 22 10. Proximal Phalanx (P1) The presence of a forelimb and fore- or hind-limbarticular margin osteochondral fragment was asso-ciated with a lower likelihood of starting in a race(38% and 76% vs 91% without the lesion) and alower who earned money. 17Ar- throscopic removal of dorsoproximal horses 71% to 87% at the same or higherlevel, more commonly with lower earnings. 24-27 Non-displaced fractures have been treated conser- vatively with 4 of 6 returning to racing perfor-mance. 28Displaced fractures have been treated successfully with screw xation. Short, non-displaced dorsal fractures of the proximal medial eminence)treated by arthroscopic debridement resulted in 91%return to racing. 29Length of career and earningswere not different between cases and controls al- though injured horses had fewer post-operative starts. Eleven of 21 (52%) Thoroughbred horses with a non-comminuted P1 fracture (sagittal, dorsal oblique, physeal, and palmar process) returnedto racing performance, 65% to a higher level. 28 While moderately comminuted P1 fractures in Thor-oughbreds have been successfully repaired (92%positive outcome), none reported returned to rac-ing. 30Prognosis for survival was fair for severely comminuted fractures. 11. Carpus Radiographic visualization of lucencies in the radialfacet of the third carpal bone can be indicative ofincomplete fracture or articular 2). 31,32Similarly, distal as- of the radial carpal bone were associated with osteochondral or cartilage fragmentation in 71horses. Eighty percent (80%) of the 55 surgicallytreated horses returned to racing, 63% of these atthe same or better level. Only 42% of non-surgi- cally treated horses returned to racing, 14% at thesame or better level. 33 A recent comprehensive study of 828 Quarter Horse and Thoroughbred racehorse with ar-throscopic removal of osteochondral fragments inthe carpus found that 82% of horses raced aftersurgery, with 70% performing at the same or higherlevel than before surgery. 34Likelihood of racing after surgery was increased if horses had raced be-fore surgery, and decreased with increasing horseage, being female, and having a severe lesion withsubstantive subchondral bone removed. Similarndings have been reported in other studies. 35,36 Whereas most studies compare pre- and post-sur-gery racing performance of affected horses, a com-parison of the performance of horses surgicallytreated for carpal osteochondral fragments with un-affected control horses found better racing perfor-mance in the affected treated horses. 37Of those control horses that raced, a lower percentage of con-trol racehorses (59%) won races than affected, sur-gically treated racehorses (75%). Palmar osteochondral fragments were removed in 31 horses, many that also had dorsal fragments.Fifty-two percent (52%) returned to racing, 48%earned money, and 32% had 5 or more starts. 38 Performance decreased with increasing number ofpalmar fragments. Similar ndings were observedin a study of horses of varied disciplines, 76% re-turned to intended use. 39 Yearlings with evidence of dorsal medial intercar- pal joint disease are less likely to start in a race (63%affected vs 82% non-affected); however, for horsesthat started in a race there were no differences inplaces, money earned, or money earned per start. 22 No differences in race performance of sale yearlingswas associated with accessory carpal bone osteo-chondral fragmentation. 40 AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 21IN-DEPTH: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IMAGING FINDINGS AND LAMENESSComplete, displaced or non-displaced articular fractures commonly affect the third carpal bone.

Tarsus Yearlings with an osteophyte/enthesophyte in thedistal intertarsal or tarsometatarsal joints were lesslikely to start in a race than horses without thelesion (76% vs 82%); however, for horses that startedin a race there were no differences in places, moneyearned, or money earned per start. 22The presence of wedging of the central or third tarsal bones inhorses at 2-year-old in training sales was associatedwith a lower proportion of horses that raced (60% vs91%) and a lower proportion of earned money. 17 For horses surgically treated for tarsocrural osteo-chondrosis before 2 years of age, 43% and 2- and 3-year-olds, respectively; compared to 48%and 73% of siblings. 46 13. Stifle Flattening of the medial femoral condyle in horses at2-years-old in training sales was associated withfewer 3-year-old racing starts, compared with valuesfor horses that had no lesion. 17Weanlings and yearlings at sales that had a medial femoral condy-lar lucency /H110213 mm in depth or a cyst were less likely to start a race as a 2-year-old but onlyhorses with a cyst were less likely to start a raceas a 3-year-old compared to maternal siblings. 47 Whereas 41% of lucencies remained the same sizebetween weanling and yearling radiographs,similar proportions of horses had lesions that de-creased or increased in size.

Summary Racehorses are elite athletes that must adapt theirskeleton to the increased stresses associated withtraining and racing. Bones undergo predictablechanges in the course of adaptation and repair.Radiographically, medullary sclerosis and smoothperiosteal expansion reflect mechanisms for adapt-ing to increasing stresses with progression of racetraining. The nature of the repetitive motions as-sociated with training and racing result in typicallocations and morphologic changes when injuriesoccur. Given time (recovery), bones are capable ofrepair and regeneration. Woven bone callus re-flects an attempt to buttress an underlying weak-ness. Focal osteolysis can reflect resorption ofdamaged bone tissue, structural weakness, and riskfor greater injury\u2014until the osteolysis dissipateswhen healthy bone replaces damaged tissue. It isapparent that many horses with a radiographic ab-normality subsequently perform in a race, althoughthe proportion of horses capable of doing so can beless than unaffected horses, depending on the na-ture of the abnormality.

Puchalski, DVM, DACVR As knowledge of equine sports medicine advances, the list of differential diagnoses causing performance problems lengthens. The clinical examination is a critical component and its ndings must be consideredin conjunction with imaging ndings. Careful physical examination including detailed palpation, ma-nipulation, examination of the horse in motion, quantitative gait assessment tools, and diagnosticanesthesia are important parameters. More often than not, the adult sport horse is a complicatedinteraction of different problems of variable importance. These abnormalities may even arise fromdifferent body systems. For example, many sport horses will have lameness in more than one limb, or lameness in one limb in addition to axial skeleton dysfunction. Diagnostic imaging, in all ofits many forms, is an important piece of a complete work up that requires careful integration intothe overall clinical assessment.

Introduction The clinical assessment of an equine athlete is crit- ically important to that athlete's career longevity,acute injury diagnosis, and chronic injury manage-ment. The clinical assessment, performance his-tory, and anamnesis should lead the cliniciantoward a diagnostic imaging modality or several im-aging modalities in order to fully characterize theperceived problem. Choosing the optimal diagnos-tic imaging modality is not always easy. In mostinstances, the clinician will start with the readilyaccessible modalities of radiographs and ultrasoundwith an eye toward what more can be done withdifferent equipment. The clinician must rst ac-quire and accurately interpret the radiographic and ultrasonographic images. They should also under-stand the strengths and weaknesses of each of theadditional diagnostic imaging modalities in additionto having some concept of what they are expecting tond. In many instances, a given horse, for a given problem may have numerous modalities applied.Whenever possible, a discussion regarding addi-tional imaging is best done in advance of orderingthe additional test and after interpretation of thereadily available techniques. Multiple steps are incorporated into the evalua- tion of any diagnostic imaging results. An accuratediagnosis should be the ultimate goal of any diag- nostic imaging study. Accuracy must include theidentication of both true-positive and true-negativestudies, not just the identication of lesions. Sim-ply identifying a lesion is only a small, albeit critical,part of the entire process. Correct interpretation ofimages depends on many factors starting at imageacquisition (optimized for high-quality images withfew artifacts) and ending with decision making(where the observer both recognizes and interpretsimaging ndings correctly). The ndings must 24 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IMAGING FINDINGS AND LAMENESS NOTESthen be synthesized with the clinical exam and con- sidered in relation to the horse's discipline and per-formance level. Certain radiographic ndings such frag- ments, osteophytes, and developmental lesions arecommon ndings in sport horse practice. Horseswith these problems will present in a variety ofways. The easiest situation to interpret is whenthese ndings are limited to the lame leg, in the sitelocalized via examination or diagnostic analgesia.More often, this is not the case. Often these abnor-malities are seen in sound horses presenting forpre-purchase or sales evaluation, or as bilateral le-sions in horses with unilateral lameness. Veteri-narians must make an educated guess regarding theimpact on performance and long-term outcome. 2. Performance Equine performance outcomes are difcult to mea-sure. The lack of objective data for comparison be-tween horses with and without lesions makesscientic study design challenging. Multiple re-search groups have evaluated radiographic lesionsand performance outcomes in Thoroughbred(TB), 1-6Standardbred,7,8and French Trotter1,9,10 racehorses using racing outcomes such as total ca-reer earnings, earnings per start, and total careerstarts. Only a limited number of studies have eval-uated horses used for sports other than racing. 11-13 These studies have produced good guidelines formany commonly encountered lesions. However, itremains that veterinarians must make decisionsbased on the individual horse at hand, and eachclinical scenario is almost always different. Equestrian sports all have different demands. It is clear that a 2-year-old TB flat racing horse hasdifferent stressors placed on its cardiovascular andmusculoskeletal systems than a 12-year-old Warm-blood show jumper. With growing popularity of am-ateur involvement in many equestrian sports (e.g.,cutting, reining, dressage, show jumping, eventing,endurance), it is important to also understand thevariability of demands within a sport at different lev-els. In racing and some Western performance sports,heavy emphasis is placed on a short, intense careerwith some of the largest purses being available toyounger horses. Whereas, in other equestrian sports(e.g., dressage), it may take many years of training fora horse and rider combination to acquire the skillsnecessary to compete at the highest level. Further-more, the influence of specic trainers or training pro-grams remains a substantial and often unrevealedfactor in career longevity in horses\u2014regardless of dis-cipline. These factors should all be considered whendeciding about the signicance or future influencethat a particular radiographic lesion may have onperformance. Many factors beyond musculoskeletal health in- fluence performance in sport horses: talent andability, training program, opportunity, rider/jockey ability, goals of the owner(s) or trainer(s),and the intangible factors of horse toughness or\"heart.\" These factors most likely have unequaland variable weighting on a horse's career, cannotbe measured and confound direct evaluation ofperformance outcome in studies evaluating imag-ing versus performance. 3. Bone Fragments Not all osteochondral fragments are the same.Fragment imaging characteristics, which may alsocorrelate with breed and use, are an important con-sideration for impact on performance. Considerthe fetlock joint, where fragments occur in associa-tion with the dorsal, proximal aspect of the proximalphalanx (P1), the dorsal proximal aspect of the sag-ittal ridge the third (-metatarsal) con-dyle, proximal P1 fragmentsin Thoroughbreds are most often fractures second-ary to repetitive trauma; however, 14certain types of fragments in Warmblood and Standardbred horsesare of uncertain origin. 15Evaluation of the clinical signs and imaging characteristics can lead to con-clusions regarding etiology, chronicity, and relatedsigns. In general, dorsoproximal P1 chip fracturesreduce performance, 2an effect that may be miti- gated with surgical intervention. More confusingare horses with smooth-margined, round lesions as-sociated with dorsoproximal P1. Yearling TBhorses with this nding are less likely to start. 5 In Warmblood horses with this nding, increasingage of the horse and increasing number of fragmentsis associated with increasing odds ratio for lame-ness. 15Furthermore, in this study, older horses were more likely to have other associated joint ab-normalities such as synovitis, cartilage wear lines,erosions, and brillation. 15Plantar, proximal P1 fragments are less well understood. These areprobably more common in certain breeds of horsesincluding Standardbreds, Trotters, and Warm-bloods. 10,16,17These fragments are reported to have a relatively high incidence and influence onmeasures of performance in trotters. 10In Warm- blood horses, the influence of this lesion is not wellunderstood. In general, identifying a lesion is the rst step. Ch aracterizing the lesion fully using other imaging ndings and the presence or absence ofconcomitant lesions most likely yields a more com-plete assessment of any given lesion. Further-more, assessment of the whole horse may also bean important factor in overall performance out-comes with many reports showing that increasednumber (and severity) of lesions is associated withdecreased performance. 1,9 4. Periarticular New Bone Formation Osteophytes and enthesophytes occur in numerous lo-cations. Osteophytes provide clear evidence of jointdisease in most locations. However, specic sites,such as the proximal PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 25IN-DEPTH: THE RELATIONSHIP IMAGING FINDINGS AND LAMENESSproximomedial tibia at the medial femorotibial joint, are often identied in sound horses. Furthermore,studying the influence of these changes on perfor-mance is difcult. Qualitative imaging features inaddition to clinical information should be utilized toassess the nding(s). For example, proximal thirdmetatarsal osteoproliferation may be at the joint mar-gin (e.g., osteophyte), slightly distant from the jointmargin (likely associated with the dorsal tarsometa-tarsal ligament), or more distant from the joint margin(likely associated with the cranial tibial tendon and/orperoneus tertius insertion). If the osseous prolifera-tion is present at the joint margin, close evaluation forsubchondral bone change (irregularity or change inopacity) or other evidence of joint disease should beundertaken. Additional abnormalities will lead to astronger conclusion of the signicance of the nding.Marginal proliferation on the proximal, medial tibiamay provide evidence of joint disease. This canprompt the observer to closely inspect the medialfemoral condyle for shape change or alteration instructure, the attachment sites of the menisco-tibialor cruciate ligaments, or prompt further investigationwith additional radiographic flexedlateral oblique [cranio ultrasound. provide clearevidence of chronic pathologic change at the bone/softtissue interface. Certain locations are very fre-quently identied and likely carry limited signicance,for example the oblique sesamoidean ligaments or theproximal attachment of the distal digital annular lig-ament. Because these ndings can occur at such awide variety of locations for a wide variety of reasons,each case should be evaluated on an individual basis. When a bone spur is identied, it should be care- fully categorized as an osteophyte distant from thejoint (joint margin) osteo-phyte, (tendon/ligament/joint cap-sule insertion). The categorization of the lesionwill then prompt either active dismissal of the le-sion as insignicant, further investigation of thelesion, or allow the observer to make a diagnosis. 5. Osteochondrosis Osteochondrosis lesions come in all shapes andsizes, and should include lesions of endochondralossication that develop in juvenile horses. A moreinclusive term of juvenile osteochondral conditions 19 has been proposed include osteochondrosis, apophysealbone. Many studies evaluate the influence of lesionsize, location, surgical versus medical managementand the influence on outcome. 1,20-26Overall, the understanding of these conditions is much greaterin horses used for racing than other non-racingdisciplines. In general, osteochondrosis increases the likeli- hood of untoward downstream effects including sy-novitis and osteoarthritis. The identication of anosteochondrosis lesion should prompt an immediateassessment of multiple factors that include the le-sion size and depth, the relationship to the weightbearing surface and/or other articular components,the presence of other associated joint abnormalitiessuch as soft-tissue or osteophyte formation,and surgical of related lesions contralateral lesionslikely increases the clinical signicance of lesions inthe individual animal. 6. Cervical Spine High-quality radiographs of the cervical vertebraeprovide a wealth of information about vertebralmorphology. 27,28Quality assessment should be performed by the operator at the time of image ac-quisition. Patient positioning and preparation,beam angle, lm focal distance, exposure, and mo-tion all play a role in image quality that can signif-icantly detract from the clinical utility ofradiographs. Latero-lateral radiographs have sev-eral limitations including superimposition of thebone over the soft tissues of the spinal cord andarticular process joints, a lack of orthogonal projec-tions, and that they are generally taken with a xedor stationary head position. These limitations canbe partially alleviated through quantication of thesagittal diameter ratios, the use of oblique and/orpositional projections and complementary imagingtechniques such as ultrasound, and the use of con-trast media (myelography). Thoughtful consider-ation of the limitations and their respectivesolutions should enter into the clinicians' rationaleearly in the discourse. When quantication of sag-ittal diameter ratios and myelography are em-ployed, it is important to remember that even thesetechniques are faulted. Inter- and intra-observervariability in ratio measurement make the use ofthis technique somewhat questionable except invery positive or very negative cases. 3Similarly, myelography, though for a time considered to be thegold standard for the identication of spinal cordcompression, is fraught with false-negative andfalse-positive results. Even with these limitations,radiographs are still useful for the evaluation of theshape, size, alignment, symmetry, opacity, andnumber of vertebrae giving good information aboutmany disease processes. Ultrasound is invaluable for the assessment of the vertebral surfaces and associated soft tissues, andfor its role in ultrasound-guided or ultrasound-assisted interventions. In general, ultrasound doesnot provide useful information for the assessment ofthe central nervous system. Nerve-root evaluationcan be performed when the nerve roots or lowermotor neurons exit the vertebral canal. Evaluationof the nerve roots can be performed in the lumbosa-cral region on per-rectal ultrasound examinationproviding some information about these structures.Ultrasound is complementary to radiographs forevaluation of the nuchal bursa, artic- 26 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IMAGING FINDINGS AND LAMENESSular processes and joints of the cervical, thoracic and thoracolumbar spine, the supraspinous ligament,the interspinous ligaments and spacing of tho-racic and lumbar dorsal processes. In the thoracicand thoracolumbar spine, ultrasound of the dorsalaspect of the spinous processes and supraspinousligament can be very misleading for the diagnosis ofspinous process impingement and should always beused in concert with radiographs. Ultrasoundalone can be used for evaluation of the pelvis andsacroiliac region including the associated soft tis-sues, but is often more useful when used in conjunc-tion with nuclear scintigraphy. Ultrasound is oftenused to guide intra- or peri-articular injections of theintervertebral joints or sacro-iliac regions, or to sam-ple cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from various locations. Diagnostic imaging, featuring the novel tech- niques, has allowed for great leaps forward in ourunderstanding of pathology of the cervical verte-brae. Even the common usage of modern radiogra-phy equipment with good quality image processinghas allowed great leaps forward in the ability tomake diagnoses pertaining to the cervical vertebrae.Any differential diagnosis impacting the cervical Fig. 1. Laterolateral radiograph of the mid-cervical spine. C3, C4, and C5 have indistinguishable anatomic features and external markers in this region can be helpful, particularly when using a small size (portable) radiograph detector (plate). Note that thetransverse processes of C4 are well positioned with near-perfect superimposition (white arrows) but the transverse processes of C5(black arrows) have discrepant cranial margins (A and B). The most likely cause of this is lateroflexion of the neck at the time ofradiographic acquisition. Fig. 2. Laterolateral radiograph of the caudal cervical spine. There is caudal tubercle of one transverse processof C6 to C7 (*) with a normal transverse process on the other side (black arrow). Moderate periarticular new bone production ispresent on the ventral margins of the articular processes of C6 to C7 (arrows, A and B). The spinous process of C7 (C) is superimposedover the dorsal margin of the articular processes. This is frequently misinterpreted as new bone formation. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 27IN-DEPTH: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IMAGING FINDINGS AND LAMENESSvertebrae and/or spinal cord and/or nerve roots can manifest as cervical region pain. Cervical articular process joint disease (osteoarthri- tis) with or without malformation or developmentalorthopedic disease (osteochondrosis) of the vertebrae isa common diagnosis in equine sports medicine practicefor horses with clinical signs ranging from stiffness and inability or unwillingness to flex (sometimesone direction more than another), forelimb lame-ness to xed neck position. Critical assessmentof radiographic quality is very important asmarginal quality radiographs can both overesti- mate and underestimate abnormalities of thisregion (Fig. 1). More research is needed to un-derstand the relationship between radiographic abnormalities and clinical signs as mild radio-graphic abnormalities can be clinically silent.Nuclear scintigraphy and ultrasound are fre-quently used in conjunction with radiographs tofurther characterize this problem. Important ra-diographic margination regional sclerosis and enlargement of thearticular processes, and asymmetry of the articu-lar processes (Fig. 2). These ndings are muchbetter appreciated on cross-sectional imaging mo-dalities (computed tomography [CT]), and can bemore fully characterized to the inter-vertebral foramina and dura mater. Anomalousvertebral developmental can be an important un-derlying cause of osteoarthritis that is often notdiagnosed on plain radiographs (Fig. 3). Nuchal desmopathy/enthesopathy, as identied on radiographs, is horseswith clinical signicance. Nuchal bursitisis invariably clinically signicant, particularly whenit is associated with a septic etiology. Clinical signsrelating to nuchal ligament pain range from inabil-ity or unwillingness to flex at the poll, extreme painon palpation or when placing a halter or bridle, orthis can be a radiographic nding with no clinicalrelevance. This imaging diagnosis must always beinterpreted with clinical examination ndings. Intervertebral disc disease is uncommon in horses. When intervertebral disc space collapse is identied, itis important to evaluate the horse and radiographs forother evidence relating to the potential etiology. Pos-sibilities include previous trauma, discospondylitis,neoplasia, and degeneration. Disc-space narrowing Fig. 3. Transverse CT image through the C7 to T1 articular process joints. There is marked asymmetry of the articular pro-cesses that is most likely anomalous development. This causesmarked, asymmetric stenosis of the intervertebral foramen(white arrow) in a horse with unilateral, intermittent forelimblameness. Fig. 4. Laterolateral radiograph of the caudal cervical spine in a 15-year-old warmblood dressage horse with inability or unwilling-ness to do collected dressage movements. The intervertebral disc space is nearly completely collapsed at C6 to C7 (white arrows) witha step defect between the ventral lamina of C6. 28 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IMAGING FINDINGS AND LAMENESScan be associated with soft tissue, presumably inter- vertebral disc material, specically annulus brosus,extending into the ventral vertebral canal and causingextra-dural cord compression that may be iden-tied with myelography (CT or radiographic). Criti-cal assessment of end plate morphology needed todifferentiate between aggressive and non-aggressivecauses of intervertebral disc-space collapse (Fig. 4). In summary, bone chips, bone spurs and osteochon- drosis, and cervical changes occur commonly in perfor-mance horses. The identication of lesions must beaccompanied with an understanding of the demandsplaced on the horse for its given sport, and a search foradditional, related lesions. Broad guidelines providesome information for the interpretation of these le-sions, but each individual case should be contemplatedseparately. Exceptions to every rule exist with a rarehorse having an exceptional performance career withmajor radiographic ndings and other horses havingpoor performance as a of minor ndings. Adirect correlation between radiographic lesion pres-ence and performance will remain elusive and goodclinical judgment will always be necessary.

Advanced imaging modalities are now routinely used in equine practice and the technology involvedcontinues to advance at a fairly rapid pace. It canbe difcult for practitioners to decide which modal-ities to choose for both diagnosis and re-evaluation,particularly in light of some modalities requiringreferral and/or general anesthesia, notably high- eld magnetic resonance images (MRIs). The pur-pose of this paper is to provide an overview of howcertain imaging modalities can be used alone or incombination to guide rehabilitation protocols anddecision making such as return to performance aswell as prognosis following musculoskeletal injury.The accuracy of certain imaging techniques for di-agnosing specic injuries in combination with local-izing blocks is beyond the scope of this paper and ispresented in other papers within this session. 2. Imaging Modalities Ultrasonography Traditional B-mode gray-scale ultrasound examina- tion in both the transverse and longitudinal planeshas been used for decades to diagnose and monitortendon and ligament injuries. 1,2A typical exami-nation involves measurement of the overall tendon or ligament cross-sectional area, lesion cross- sectional area, and total proximal-to-distal length ofthe lesion in the transverse plane as well as subjec-tive assessment of the lesion echogenicity on a grad-ing scale. In the longitudinal plane, loss of linearber pattern is either subjectively reported as apercentage or using a grading system. Decreasesin lesion and overall tendon/ligament size correlatedwith improvements in echogenicity and linear berpattern are indicative of healing and used to guiderehabilitation protocols. 1It is well known, how- ever, that flexor tendons in particular appear wellhealed on gray-scale ultrasound examination longbefore they are histologically healed and biome-chanically stable. 3,4For this reason, ultrasound techniques that allow for more in-depth interroga- tion of tendon healing have been explored and arenow being used to monitor the healing of both ten-don and ligament injuries in horses as well as inhumans. Color or Power Doppler, as originally described for use in the cardiology eld, uses high-frequencysound waves to measure blood flow and is now usedbroadly in both equine and human sports medicine 30 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IMAGING FINDINGS AND LAMENESS NOTESfor the differentiation of active versus inactive ten- don and ligament injuries.5-11In terms of monitor- ing tendon healing, Doppler is especially useful foridentifying the progression of a tendon lesion outof the inflammation and proliferation/reparativephases in which hypervascular granulation tissueexists (Fig. 1, A and B) and into the remodelingphase in which hypovascular scar tissue predomi- nates (Fig. 1C). Such information is helpful fordetermining lesion resolution, or lack thereof insome cases, and for appropriately guiding increasesin levels of controlled exercise. Doppler is also veryuseful for assessing re-injury or even setbacks dur-ing the initial rehabilitation period in which a lesionthat was hypovascular on a previous examinationsuddenly becomes vascular again. While little in-formation is available regarding the use of Dopplerfor assessing ligament healing, a descriptive studyexamining the suspensory branches of 13 horses didnd Doppler signal in all branches that were abnor-mal on gray-scale ultrasound and did not nd Dopp-ler signal in any branches that were normal on gray-scale ultrasound. 10While these results were not able to be correlated to soundness, they provide justication for further investigation of the use ofDoppler for the assessment of ligament injuries. 10 Elastography is another ultrasound technique now used in both equine and human sports medicineto assess the quality of healing tendon tissue. 3,12-14 Elastography allows for determination of tissuestiffness through application of compression withthe ultrasound probe which results in tissue defor-mation (strain) and alteration of sound waves as they travel through that tissue. Normal tendon tis-sue is stiffer than injured tendon and therefore elas-tography can be used to monitor tendon healing overtime from \"soft\" to \"hard\" tissue as commonly re- ported with a color scale on most ultrasound pro- grams (Fig. 2). In a prospective longitudinal studyon the healing of naturally occurring supercial dig-ital flexor tendon injuries in 7 racing an important nding was that gray-scale ultrasonography scores improved over the initial 3months but then became static while elastography scores and strain ratios continued to improve withhealing over the full 9 months that the horses weremonitored. 3Similar to as described above for Dopp- ler, such information can be very useful for guidinginformed decisions on increases in exercise intensityduring rehabilitation as well as to monitor for anypotential setbacks or re-injuries in which a previouslystiff or \"hard\" tendon lesion suddenly becomes less stiff or \"soft\" again. Finally, both methods can beused to identify chronic tendon lesions that remainhypervascular and \"soft\" despite treatment and,therefore have a poor prognosis. Again, similar to as described above for Doppler, much less is knownregarding the utility of elastography for ligamentsas compared to tendons. In a study examining 33suspensory branches, however, elastography corre- lated well with gray-scale ultrasound, MRI, andclinical examination ndings, suggesting that it is auseful technique for monitoring lesions at this site. 12 Fig. 1. Doppler ultrasound examination of a substantial lesion of the dorsal aspect of the lateral lobe of the deep digital flexor tendon at level B in the pastern. Examination at the time of presentation and 2 months after presentation revealed increased vascularityof the lesion (white arrow) as expected during the proliferation and reparative phases of healing (A and B) which was resolved by 6months post-presentation (C). For all images, lateral is on the left side of the image. Red represents blood flow toward theultrasound probe while blue represents blood flow away from the ultrasound probe. Fig. 2.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 31IN-DEPTH: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IMAGING FINDINGS AND LAMENESSMRI MRI is widely recognized as a valuable modality for the diagnosis of tendon, ligament, cartilage, andbone injuries. 15-25Low-eld MRI (0.27T) is gener- ally performed with the horse standing under seda-tion and has proven very useful for the diagnosisand re-evaluation of injuries in the distal limb, andparticularly in the foot. High-eld MRI (1.5T or3T) provides improved image quality and resolution,but carries the associated risk and expense of gen-eral anesthesia. For this reason, it is rare to repeata high-eld MRI for monitoring or re-assessmentunless the horse is unresponsive to therapy and/orhas become increasingly lame despite therapy.In general, studies comparing the accuracy of low-eld vs high-eld MRI for the foot, pastern, andfetlock regions have found comparable results, withthe exception of lesions of the articular cartilage andsmaller anatomical structures, which were bestvisualized on high-eld MRI. 17,18,24,25Lastly, high-eld MRI is more comm only utilized for the diagnosis of injuries localized to the carpus, tarsus,or proximal suspensory region due to the need forgeneral anesthesia to avoid excessive motion arti-facts in these Tomography In equine practice, computed tomography (CT) hashistorically been used for the examination of osseousstructures as MRI is considered the gold standardfor soft-tissue imaging. However, when comparedto MRI, CT has been shown to be useful for identi-fying soft-tissue lesions such as tears 27-29In addition, CT arthrog- be a reliable modality indetecting cruciate ligament injuries ultrasonography, andarthroscopy. 30Contrast-enhanced CT has also been shown to provide more information on angiogenesiscompared to MRI, which may provide useful informa-tion regarding prognosis and treatment. 31At this time, CT typically requires general anesthesia; how-ever, there has recently been great advancement inthe standing CT technology. As the standing CTtechnology becomes more advanced and more widelyavailable, this modality could be very useful for mon-itoring sports medicine and rehabilitation injurieswith the benets of lack of general anesthesia, rela-tively quick procedure, and information regardingangiogenesis. Nuclear Scintigraphy Nuclear scintigraphy, or bone scans, are widely usedin equine sports medicine for diagnosing not onlyosseous injuries but soft-tissue and vascular injuriesas well. In the authors' practice, nuclear scintigra-phy can be a useful tool for monitoring and reas-sessing bone bruises or osseous injuries identiedon MRI without the need for repeat generalanesthesia. 32,333. Monitoring of Soft-Tissue Injuries \"Simple\" Tendon and Ligament Lesions with Overt Fiber Pattern Disruption In the authors' practice, soft-tissue lesions of the distal limb and outside of the hoof capsule that haveovert ber pattern disruption are generally m oni- tored every 2-4 weeks initially during the acutephase and then every 4-8 weeks until healed.The imaging ndings are assessed in combinationwith a physical and lameness evaluation. Resultsof these examinations guide decision making on re-habilitation protocols and eventual return to fullwork. Typically, an increase in exercise intensity ismade only after a favorable lameness examinationwith improvement in healing from the previousultrasound examination. In the authors' practice,the trainer and/or owner of all horses entering into arehabilitation program are given the overall expec-tation for time to return to full work provided thatthe lesion heals well and are counseled on the im-portance of calm stall rest with controlled exercise.When needed, long-term sedatives such as reser- pine 34or trazadone35are prescribed for the horse to facilitate this. In addition, the trainer and/orowner are counseled on the importance of maintain-ing overall tness as much as possible during therehabilitation period by utilizing mobility, strengthbuilding, and core stability exercises. Following strict stall rest as needed, controlled daily walking is generally instituted for 8 weeks with gradual increases in duration building up to40 minutes by that 8-week mark. In the authors'sport horse practice, experience shows that this(sometimes) is best accomplished under saddlerather than in hand (depending on what is best for the safety of the rider and horse) to keep the horsefocused and in the mindset of working. Providedthat the 8-week recheck examination reveals im-provement or no increase in lesion severity, trottingis gradually introduced to the rehabilitation pro-gram starting at very short, straight sets (i.e., longside of arena) with walking in between for the rstweek then gradually increasing weekly with the goalof 30-35 minutes of trot work with walk breaks by16 weeks into the rehabilitation program. Groundpoles, or cavalettis, are also gradually introducedduring this trotting period to improve strength andproprioception and keep the horse engaged in work.It has been the authors' experience that trot work isoften required to provide the biomechanical stimu-lus necessary for appropriate tendon healing and inparticular the regression of vasculature. For thisreason, unless a lesion is very severe and/or hasworsened in terms of size and loss of ber pattern, it is rare for the authors to extend the walking periodrather than start the trotting period. After 8 weeksof trotting, however, the authors look for denitiveimprovement in both ber pattern and regression ofvasculature prior to the start of canter work and/orwork of increased intensity like lateral work depend- 32 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IMAGING FINDINGS AND LAMENESSing on the horse's discipline. Persistent hypervas- cularity at this stage, even with return to normalber pattern, is worrisome to the authors for thehorse's prognosis and particularly the ability to in-crease work without further injury. At this stage,the authors re-evaluate the horse's rehabilitationprogram both in terms of management (i.e., horseand trainer/owner compliance) and rehabilitationmodalities. In general, the authors' preference is for a horse to be cantering under saddle for 4 weeks and doingwell on recheck examination prior to any turnout ina sizeable paddock, but understand that this maynot be feasible for all horses depending on temper-ament, etc. After this point, increase in work in-tensity is very disciplined and horse-specic but forall horses the authors like to see complete resolutionof the lesion on gray-scale as well as complete re-gression of vasculature on Doppler prior to such anincrease. Additionally, the lesion, should appear\"hard\" on elastography. Once a horse has returnedto full work, it is common in the authors' practice tore-assess the old injury site every 3-6 months orsooner (depending on severity) to monitor for subtlesigns of re-injury and then adjust work level and/orrehabilitation accordingly. In particular, the au-thors utilize Doppler imaging to evaluate for poten-tial return of vascularity and elastography to assess for a \"softening\" of the tendon/ligament that mayprecede any changes in ber pattern. The above recommendations are basic exercise components of a rehabilitation protocol. There aremany other options including, but not limited to,underwater treadmill, salt water spa, vibrationplate, laser, shockwave, and therapeutic ultrasoundthat the authors' utilize depending on the case andthe owners' desire and nancial ability. Where ap-plicable, these specic modalities and therapies are discussed below under specic conditions. Digital Flexor Tendon Sheath Pathology Pathology within the digital flexor tendon sheath(DFTS) can be challenging to accurately diagnose,treat, and rehabilitate. New methods have beendescribed to better dene or MRI,37and dynamic ultrasonography.38,39In the authors' practice, it is common to utilize multiple imagingmodalities in addition to tenoscopy in order to bestcharacterize and treat DFTS pathology as well asprovide owners with an accurate prognosis. Unlike\"simple\" tendon and ligament lesions describedabove, lesions/tears within the DFTS are at risk ofadhesion formation and restriction from such adhe-sions and/or palmar/plantar annular ligament con-striction which cause pain and can substantiallylimit performance. 39-41For this reason, rehabilita- tion of these injuries in the authors' practice alsoincludes specic passive and active range of motion(ROM) exercises. Passive ROM exercises involve a human moving the limb, and more specically inthis case, the fetlock joint region through the normalROM, while active ROM exercises include walkingin the underwater treadmill 42and walking or trot- ting over ground poles. Water height in the under-water treadmill is adjusted on a case by case basisdepending on the horse's comfort level. In addition,the authors often utilize therapeutic ultrasound, la-ser, and friction massage to try to limit and/or pre-vent adhesion formation, which is associated withpoor prognosis. Suspensory Branch Pathology As with most soft tissues, ultrasound is the imagingmodality of choice when evaluating the suspensorybranches. Due to the ease of diagnosis via ultra-sound, further advanced imaging such as MRI isusually not necessary. In the authors' opinion, acomplete radiographic examination of the fetlock re-gion is always recommended in suspensory branchcases to determine the full extent of the osseouschanges of the proximal sesamoid bones, fetlockjoint, and potentially splint bones as these changescan greatly affect prognosis, rehabilitation timeline,and treatment options. Conrming or diagnosingsuspensory ligament branch disease can be difcultwith many horses having ultrasonographic abnor-malities that are not necessarily a cause of clinicallameness. 43-45When trying to determine or con - rm a suspensory branch lesion as the cause oflameness and/or an active lesion, besides using clin-ical judgment such as pain on palpation and positiveflexion test, Doppler is frequently used in the au-thors' practice. As previously discussed, there islittle research to support this, 12but in the authors' experience increasing levels of hypervascularity onDoppler ultrasound are seen with increasing de-grees of lameness and therefore suggestive of anactive and clinical injury. An additional imagingmodality that can be useful in suspensory branchinjuries is nuclear scintigraphy. Nuclear scintigra-phy is helpful to determine the amount of osseousresponse to a given lesion as well as again determinewhether the lesion is active. Typical ultrasonographic abnormalities of suspen- sory branches are changes in shape, enlargement,diffuse or discrete ber abnormalities, and marginirregularities. Important additional abnormalitiesto note, which affect prognosis and rehabilitation protocols, are insertional ber changes at the at-tachment on the sesamoid bones with associated degree of osseous changes (evaluated in conjunctionwith radiographs), and presence and degree ofperiligamentous brosis. As ligament and bone in-terfaces are known weak spots in h ealing, injuries involving this interface such as resorptive or os-seous cyst-like lesions, slow the rehabilitationtimeline down as well as decrease prognosis. 46 Periligamentous brosis is more commonly seen in AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 33IN-DEPTH: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IMAGING FINDINGS AND LAMENESSthe hindlimbs and is associated with a decreased prognosis.43,45 In the authors' practice, all of the previously de- scribed variations in suspensory branch lesions af-fect the rehabilitation protocols and modalities thatare instituted. For example, lesions affecting theosseous structures are more likely to be treated withbisphosphonates and shockwave therapy. Horseswith periligamentous brosis are encouraged to gettherapeutic ultrasound and daily friction massages.All horses affected with suspensory branch diseaseare prescribed ROM exercises, whether it be passiveROM or active consisting of ground poles and under-water treadmill exercise; however, these exercisesbecome even more important in cases with concur-rent arthrosis of the fetlock joint. Return to work isdetermined in a similar fashion as described abovefor \"simple\" tendon and ligament injuries. Osseouscomponents are followed with exami-nation and potentially Forelimb proximal suspensory ligament aremost ultrasound with themost common ndings being enlargement and berpattern abnormalities. The suspensory ligamentcan be a more difcult structure to identify deni-tive abnormalities on ultrasound, as with the stan-dard palmar metacarpal approach the medial andlateral margins are not always visualized and thenormal architecture of the ligament contains fat andmuscle bers that can create a varied ber patternappearance. 47-49Due to the previously described difculties inherent on ultrasound of the suspensoryligament, other techniques such as nonweight-bearing examination to visualize the completesuspensory ligament margins and angle contrastultrasonography to help distinguish between berabnormalities, scarring, normal tendon bers,and normal fat and muscle bers have been de-scribed. 47,48An important part of the ultrasound examination is the origin of the suspensory ligamenton the palmar metacarpal bone as enthesopathy af-fects Radiographic examination of the proximal m eta- carpal region is an important adjunct to the ultra-sound examination of the suspensory ligament.Varying degrees of osseous changes of the palmarthird metacarpal bone at the origin of the suspensory ligament consisting of sclerosis, resorptive change,avulsion fragment, and stress fractures will changeprognosis and treatment. Other important osseousstructures that should be evaluated with the sus-pensory ligament are the splint bones. It is pru-dent to evaluate the suspensory ligament with mostsplint bone abnormalities. With exostosis of themetacarpal bones, it is not always possible to deter- mine the amount of axial osseous proliferationradiographically. Ultrasound should be used toevaluate whether there is im pingement into the suspensory or adhesion formation. In the author'spractice, rarely is MRI needed to obtain an accuratediagnosis and prognosis with forelimb proximal sus-pensory cases. However, it can be useful in casesthat are not responding to treatment or in cases ofre-injury. In cases of axial splint bone prolifera-tion, MRI can be useful to determine the full extentof the axial splint bone proliferation and adhesionformation, as these changes affect prognosis, treat-ment, and likelihood of re-injury. To determine the full extent of the bone response, a nuclear scintigraphy examination can also be help-ful, especially when evaluating potential stressfractures or avulsion fragments, which will greatlyaffect the rehabilitation protocol requiring pro-longed rest and potential prognosis. In these cases,rehabilitation is not only geared towards the af-fected soft tissues but also the osseous structures aspreviously discussed with suspensory branches asthese interfaces can be a major weakness during andafter the healing phase. 46 Hindlimb proximal suspensory injuries can be dif- cult to both diagnose and monitor.50-53Subtle lesions are often hard to detect on gray-scale ultra-sound examination and neither Doppler nor elastog-raphy have proven particularly useful in these casesto date. 12In addition, moderate-to-severe lesions that are visible on ultrasound can have additionalpathology not always visible on ultrasound thatwould substantially change the horse's prognosis aswell as candidacy for neurectomy of the deep branchof the lateral plantar nerve. High-eld MRI is gen-erally thought of as the gold standard for making adiagnosis and for assessing prognosis, because of theability of high-eld MRI to accurately detect pathol-ogy of the entire suspensory ligament, including thetarsal extension commonly called the proximal bun-dle or accessory ligament of the suspensory liga-ment, which cannot be visualized well on ultrasoundexamination (Fig 3). 50,53Injuries in the tarsal ex- tension can lead to persistent lameness despitetreatment and even neurectomy as this extension isproximal to the insertion of the deep branch of thelateral plantar nerve. Other imaging ndings in-dicative of a poor prognosis include adhesions ofthe suspensory ligament to the surrounding soft tis-sues or bone, which can also be a reason for failureto respond to neurectomy, 51and advanced bone changes at the origin of the suspensory ligament on the plantar aspect of the third metatarsal bone thatcan be visualized on both ultrasound and MRI aswell as radiographs if the bone changes are signi-cant. It is also important to rule out tarsal diseasein horses that block to the proximal suspensoryligament region as it is not uncommon for worsechanges to be seen in the tarsus that may affectfuture prognosis and treatment options. 26,50Such imaging ndings warrant open discussions with theowner about realistic expectations for the horse,particularly when combined with poor conformationsuch as a straight hock or dropped fetlock. Proxi-mal suspensory ligament lesions that are readily 34 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IMAGING FINDINGS AND LAMENESSvisualized on gray-scale ultrasound examination and lack other additional ndings on MRI are rou-tinely monitored as described above for \"simple\" ten-don and ligament injuries. Soft-Tissue Injuries Within the Hoof Capsule Soft-tissue injuries within the hoof capsule are un-doubtedly best detected on MRI. 15,16,18,19-22Un- like high-eld MRI, low-eld standing MRI is alsocommonly used for re-evaluation/monitoring of inju-ries to structures such as the collateral ligamentsof the distal interphalangeal joint, apparatus.As ultrasonography techniques have advanced, it isalso more commonplace now to be able to detectinjuries within the hoof capsule using ultrasound inconjunction with the knowledge of the MRI ndings.For example, insertional lesions of the deep digitalflexor tendon diagnosed on MRI can be imaged andmonitored using ultrasound via a transcuneal ap-proach after thorough paring out of the frog andsoaking of the foot (Fig. 4). 54In the authors' prac- tice, proper foot balance and therapeutic shoeing area critical part of rehabilitation of soft-tissue injurieswithin the hoof capsule and are determined on acase-by-case basis. In the authors' experience, asubstantial lesion of a collateral ligament requiresa prolonged rehabilitation period compared tomany other soft tissue injuries and also have a highlikelihood of re-injury. Shockwave and laser areoften utilized but both treatment and follow-up im-aging are largely determined by lesion accessibilityeither inside or outside of the hoof capsule. Simi-larly, treatment of insertional lesions of the deepdigital flexor tendon are limited in terms of access tothe structure and often carry a poor prognosis in theauthors' opinion for sustained athletic activity. 4. Monitoring of Bone and Cartilage Injuries Bone Injuries Increased use of MRI, particularly in sport horses, has led to increased ndings of bone abnormalities,including bone marrow edema, sclerosis, and enthe-siopathy. 26,55While the clinical relevance of some of these lesions can be difcult to determine, a com-bination of MRI ndings, diagnostic analgesia, andnuclear scintigraphy can be helpful to both deter- mine clinical relevance and monitor response totreatment and rest. A recent study of 166 sportand pleasure horses undergoing low-eld MRI of thefetlock region found a 76.5% prevalence of bone mar-row lesions in the distal condyles of the third meta-carpal bone with the dorsal aspects of the medialcondyle and of the sagittal ridge being most com-mon. 55Lesion severity was not associated with lameness localization ndings in this study, how-ever, and the vast majority of the lesions found weregrade 1 lesions extending less than 1/3 of the dorsalhalf of the condyle. The bone marrow lesions wereconsidered the primary cause of lameness in only Fig. 3.

For lesions thatare considered the primary cause of lameness, nu- clear scintigraphy may be helpful for both con- rming the diagnosis and for determining lesionresolution following treatment and rest in order toavoid repeated general anesthetic events for re-evaluation with high-eld MRI, although this is alsoan option (Fig. 5). Nuclear scintigraphy may alsobe very useful for the monitoring of bone pathologyof the foot previously diagnosed on MRI, includingosseous trauma to the distal phalanx and ungularcartilages as well as enthesiophytes at the insertionof the deep digital flexor tendon on the distal pha-lanx (Fig. 6). 32Generally, the authors' recommend a period of 90-120 days of rest and rehabilitation forbone marrow lesions prior to re- evaluation. Reha- bilitation often involves the use of underwatertreadmill and/or controlled exercise in soft footing tolimit concussive forces. In addition, the authors'often utilize vibration plate and pulsed electromag-netic eld therapy on these cases. Cartilage Injuries and Osteoarthritis Cartilage injuries are best diagnosed and monitoredvia high-eld MRI as described above and arthros-copy when indicated. As cartilage has extremelypoor healing capacity, prognosis and rehabilitationgoals are aimed at limiting progression and restor-ing a normal joint environment as much as possible.In these cases, it is important to determine the ex-tent of associated subchondral bone injury both forprognosis and rehabilitation timeline, as damage tosubchondral bone will both decrease prognosis andsubstantially lengthen rehabilitation time. For allcases, rehabilitation is focused on preserving joint Fig. 5.

Introduction Imaging of horses falls into two broad categories: imaging performed to diagnose the cause of a lame-ness or performance issue, and imaging performedto try to predict or rule out lesions that could causeproblems in the future, such as the pre-purchaseexam. Each of these scenarios presents unique challenges but both require a combination of clinicalexperience, scientic review, and educated guessesto come up with the appropriate answer. There aretwo specic steps to take when reviewing images:1) analysis\u2014nd and describe the lesions and iden-tify what is normal; and 2) synthesis\u2014applying allthe other pertinent details of the horse's history,signalment, and clinical exam, and integrating this information with the imaging ndings to weigh riskand signicance. Both of these steps are crucialand each must be performed in its own right. Theanalysis should be undertaken without biasbased on clinical suspicion and be considered a fact-nding mission. The next step of synthesis is alsoessential\u2014without pertinent clinical information,most imaging ndings are of little value. Many elements can influence the signicance of imaging lesions. One of these elements is thehorse's discipline. The reason for this is multifac-torial and includes demands of the sport, breed pre-disposition, client expectations, and culture, among other factors. Western performance encompasses arange of disciplines with different expectations interms of speed, agility, and longevity. The inten-tion is to review common imaging ndings that af-fect horses in these disciplines, what is known andwhat is suspected in terms of the signicance ofthese ndings in relation to performance andlameness. 2. Foot By far the most commonly imaged area and mostfrequently localized source of lameness, the foot iscomplex and often requires more than one imagingmodality for complete assessment. 1However, as a rst line, radiographs are not obsolete and still pro-vide very valuable information. The Quarter Horse dominates the Western disci- plines and with that comes certain lesions to whichthese horses are prone. In particular, damageto the navicular apparatus is a primary concern.There are many radiographic changes that can besuggestive of ovoid or AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 39IN-DEPTH: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IMAGING FINDINGS AND LAMENESS NOTEStriangular in shape. Quarter Horses normally have smaller synovial invaginations than someother breeds such as Warmbloods and should beassessed as such. Even within the breed there is arange of normal and therefore comparison betweenlimbs is helpful to identify some changes. The sig-nicance of dilated synovial invaginations remainsa source of debate and depends on the degree ofchange. Recently it has been suggested that syno-vial invagination dilation may be associated withsynovitis of the joint ratherthan primary navicular disease, although this the author's opinion, mild-to-moderate synovial invagination di-lation in the absence of other abnormalities in thebone can be incidental and may not change overtime. Dilation of the synovial invaginations be-comes a concern when the results incyst-like extends to the cortex. Enlarged synovial the flexor cortex, which is a clinicallyrelevant nding. Distal Border Fragments Quarter Horses are a small component of the popu-lation in the reported studies regarding the signi-cance of distal border fragments. The literature ismixed on the signicance of these ndings; the studywith the greatest number of Quarter Horses did notshow a signicant relationship between distal bor-der fragments identied on magnetic resonance im-aging (MRI) and lameness. 3On MRI, fragments can be seen on the distal border of otherwise com-pletely normal navicular bones or can also be a com-ponent of other navicular apparatus changes. Thesignicance is likely a continuum of severity withother changes, and in isolation, these fragments arenot likely to be a primary source of lameness. Proximal Vascular Channels Dilation of the proximal vascular supply of the na-vicular bones can be difcult to identify rad iograph- ically until advanced changes are present, butobserving the shape of the n avicular bone on the lateral view is helpful to identify an increasedconcave margin to the proximal border of the na-vicular bone. This change is more readily identi-ed with MRI. Dilation of the proximal vascularchannels is rarely found incidentally, in soundlimbs, or in isolation and is an indication of navic-ular disease that is clinically signicant. In-creased size and number of the proximal vascularchannels has been shown to be associated withlesions of the flexor cortex and deep digital flexortendon. 4 Sclerosis Trabecular and endosteal sclerosis of the navicularbone damageand/or flexor cortical bone loss (Fig. 1). This can bea challenge for image interpretation as positionalartifacts can mimic sclerosis. As this is a clinicallysignicant nding when real, it is important to dis-tinguish artifact from true change. The nding should be repeatable on both the lateral and skyline radiograph; if seen on only one view, it is more likelyartifact. Flexor Cortical Lysis Flexor cortical erosions routinely associated with lameness.While small flexor cortex lesions can be found in thecontralateral non or less lame leg on a bilateral MRIor computed tomography (CT) foot study, it is rare tond these lesions incidentally in horses that are infull work and completely sound. While some horseswith these lesions can be serviceably sound andmanageable for a period of time, generally theselesions progress and often have other comorbiditiessuch as damage to the deep digital flexor tendon andnavicular bursitis. Deep Digital Flexor digital flexor tendon can occurin conjunction with navicular disease or in isolation.While horses can manage for a while with somedegree of tendon damage, lesions often progress orworsen with continued work. Dorsal border fray-ing is most frequently found at the level of the prox-imal recess of the navicular bursa and has beenreported to have improved likelihood for return towork than other lesions types. 5Deep digital flexor tendon damage is much more likely to be found inlame horses than sound horses, indicating that it israrely an incidental nding. 6An important prac- tice note is that deep digital flexor tendon core le- Fig. 1.

Pastern Osteoarthritis of the pastern joint is of variable clin-ical signicance and moderate changes can be foundin the absence of lameness. Subchondral bone ly-sis, subchondral cystic lesions, and joint space nar-rowing are more likely to be signicant. 4. Fetlock The fetlock generally does not receive the same at-tention in Western horses as in racehorses and Eng-lish sport horses. While a less common area ofinjury, there are still lesions of signicance thatpertain to Western performance horses. Evidenceof osteoarthritis of the metatarsophalangeal jointmay be of greater signicance in team roping heel-ing horses, which are more prone to changes in thisjoint and to hind-limb lameness than headinghorses. signicance. Fetlock radiographs often do notadequately depict the degree of pathology in thejoint, so horses that block to the fetlock and do nothave sufcient radiographic changes to explain thelameness often benet from MRI. Subchondralbone damage of the fetlock joint presents a manage-ment challenge and can result in long-term lame-ness. Western pleasure and competitive trailhorses are more prone to repetitive stress injuries,including of the fetlock joint a; therefore, changes in this joint should be examined more critically in thispopulation. 5. Forelimb Suspensory Apparatus Reining and cutting horses have a propensity todevelop forelimb suspensory ligament injuries.In cutting horses, the degree of lameness and sever-ity of the suspensory ligament injury has not beenshown to affect likelihood of return to work or earn-ings in limited age events, with 22 of 30 in the studyreturning to work. 8However, it was not deter- mined by the study whether these horses still hadsome degree of lameness despite the positive perfor-mance outcome. The most common manifestation of suspensory ligament desmopathy is ligamentous enlargement(Fig. 2). This enlargement persists even after theresolution of the clinical signs; therefore, suspensoryligament changes found on ultrasound have to becorrelated with lameness evaluation to assess sig-nicance. Bone marrow lesions (often called bonebruises) of the third metacarpal bone at the suspen-sory ligament origin are almost always of clinicalsignicance. These require MRI for identication.Some horses that block to the proximal suspensoryregion can have almost no ligament change andalmost all of the pathology is related to the bone.In such cases, these horses may have relatively nor-mal ultrasound ndings and MRI can be valuablefor detecting the primary source of lameness. 6. Supercial Digital Flexor Tendon Older Quarter Horses have been reported to suffermore from damage to the proximal aspect of theforelimb supercial digital flexor tendon with a lowrate of return to work. 9Western performance horses are less likely to develop a classic core lesionand more frequently have peripheral tendon tears.This pattern has been reported in cutting horses inthe mid metacarpus with good rate of return to work(82%) and low recurrence rate (18%). 10In the au- thor's experience, the reinjury rate seems to behigher in reining horses, who tend to get lesions that\"zipper\" or extend up or down from the originalinjury site. It is crucial when performing the ultra-sound scan to extend the range of the ultrasoundinto the carpal canal to avoid missing lesions thatare clinically Therefore, the signi-cance of supercial digital flexor tendon injuriesshould weighed are inthe proximal metacarpus and/or carpal canal andwhen reining horses are affected. 7. Carpus Similar to the fetlock, the carpus receives less atten-tion in Western horses. Carpal arthritis has beenreported as a low percentage as a cause of lamenessin barrel horses. 11While it is certainly a less com- mon cause of forelimb lameness than foot-relatedpain, barrel horses are prone to more severe osteo-arthritis of the carpus compared to other Westernperformance disciplines (Fig. 3). Often these horsesare able to manage mild-to-moderate osteoarthritisof the carpus and may not present for carpal-relatedlameness until the changes are more advanced.This is important in relation to longevity and clientexpectations for career length; a barrel horse with Fig. 2.

The suspensory ligament isdiffusely enlarged with palmar displacement of the fat and mus-cle bundles (arrows).

Reining horses can have repetitive osseous stress and sclerosis of the third carpal bone, similar to thatof racehorses, and therefore including a skyline viewof the carpus is warranted in these horses withlameness localized to the carpus. 8. Elbow and Shoulder While not specic to the Western performance horse,subchondral bone injury, osteochondrosis, and os-teoarthritis of the elbow and shoulder do not tend tobe well tolerated and ndings of disease in thesejoints is usually clinically signicant. 9. Hind Suspensory Apparatus Hind-limb suspensory ligament disease affects alldisciplines but is particularly problematic in cut-ting 12and reining horses. In rope horses, more suspensory injuries have been reported in headinghorses than heeling horses. 13Lameness due to suspensory ligament damage can be challenging todenitively diagnose because of the overlap in block-ing patterns and propensity for Western perfor-mance horses to have concurrent distal tarsaldisease. A retrospective review of tarsal/metatar- sal MRIs predominantly of Western performancehorses found that almost 47% of the horses that hadlameness resolve with diagnostic theproximal suspensory ligament hadmore distal tarsal than changes to thePSL. 14 Ultrasound of the PSL is the most common diag- nostic imaging modality. It is the author's rmopinion that an ultrasound of the PSL must includeassessment of the ligament with the limb nonweightbearing. Similar to the forelimb, the most commonmanifestation of PSL desmopathy is enlargementand this will persist even when clinical signs re-solve; therefore, it must be correlated with theresults of the lameness exam. Similar bone re-sorption and proliferation of the plantar cortex will also persist even when lameness resolves. The se-verity of ligament and signicantly correlate 14In a retrospective review tarsal and metatarsal MRIs in cutting horses, 9 of17 horses diagnosed with PSL disease on MRI didnot return to work. There was no association be-tween severity of lesions and the likelihood to returnto work or the degree of lameness c. The surprise being that one cannot predict outcome based on theseverity of the injury. 10. Tarsus Distal tarsal osteoarthritis is a major contributor tohind-limb lameness in Western horses across alldisciplines. However, there is a fairly large rangeof clinical signicance of tarsal changes, which canmake them a challenge to interpret. In the juvenilehorse, dorsal wedging or malformation of the tarsalbones indicates an increased likelihood of develop-ing osteoarthritis and should be noted as a risk.The distal intertarsal joint is more prone to an kylo- sis than the tarsometatarsal joint. The earlierphases of ankylosis, particularly when accompaniedwith subchondral bone lysis, are more likely to re-sult in in the author's opinion. Oncephysiologically fused, the distal intertarsal willhave marked radiographic changes but may not beclinically signicant. The author is also of the opin-ion that lysis that extends to the plantar aspect ofthe joint and involves the second and/or fourth tar-sal bone tends to cause more severe or difcult-to-manage lameness than changes conned to thedorsal aspect of the joint. Sclerosis of the central and third tarsal bones is a normal physiologic adaptive response\u2014to a point.Once the bones become moderately to severely scle-rotic, the risk of fracture increases. In particular,barrel horses and rope horses seem more prone tocentral tarsal bone fractures than some of the otherdisciplines, perhaps related to speed work and turn- Fig. 3. Flexed lateral view of the carpus in a 7-year-old barrel horse.

These horses have a common presentation of coming up acutely, moderately to severely lamewhile working and often have no soft tissue swellingor other localizing signs. The most common orien- tation of the central tarsal bone slab fractureprecludes its identication on a standard signicant 15A dorsal 20-30\u00b0 oblique view is the optimal view for identifying thisparticular type of fracture and should always be included when the history suggests this type ofinjury. Bone marrow lesions (\"bone bruises\") of the distal tarsal bones will have uptake on a bone scan butrequire MRI to accurately localize and characterizethe lesion. Horses with tarsal bone marrow lesionshave variable lameness may improve to diag-nostic analgesia PSL, distal tarsus, or mayrequire a peroneal tibial nerve block. These lesionscan be seen along with other tarsal changes but alsocan be found in horses with otherwise completelynormal tarsi, likely as a result of trauma. 11. Stifle Stifle injuries are found among all disciplines butcutting horses in particular suffer from stifle dis-ease, primarily affecting the medial femoral condyle found on screening radio-graphs of cutting horses have not been found to beassociated with decreased performance outcome. 16 However, this study had a limited number of horseswith more severe condylar lesions and also lamenessdata were not known, therefore the long-term out-come of these changes still remains somewhat un-known and controversial. Optimally if a subchondral bone defect is identi- ed, the horse should undergo an ultrasound to as-sess for other changes in the joint. If the joint isotherwise relatively normal without synovitis andno more than mild-moderate effusion, the defect is ofquestionable signicance, particularly if the horseis already in work. Many working cutting horsescarry some effusion in the joint and if the jointcapsule is not thick and there is not synovial prolif-eration, the fluid can be incidental. Horses can have mild osteophytes of the medial tibial condyle incidentally found femoral tibial joint elongation the medial eminence are usually clinically signicantndings and are uncommonly found on screeningexams of sound, unmedicated horses (Fig. 4). In the author's opinion, tears of the medial menis- cus and medial cranial meniscotibial ligament arealso rarely incidental and are typically found in con-junction with other joint disease such as synovitisand osteoarthritis. When found with articular car-tilage damage and other joint disease, the prognosisfor return to work lessens. 17In studies that in- cluded all or the m ajority Western horses, reported rates of return to full work for horses with meniscaldamage ranged from 38% 18to 29%.17Mineralization of the indicatorand when found radiographically should be furtherexplored with ultrasound and/or arthroscopy. Injuries to the lateral femoral tibial joint are rel- atively rare in comparison to the medial, but canoccur either in isolation or in conjunction with femoral tibial joint pathology. Effusion of thelateral femoral tibial is typically not seen inci-dentally and is generally suggestive of stifle pathol-ogy, either diffusely due to communication of jointpouches or originating from the lateral femoral tib-ial joint. 12. Axial Skeleton Overall, the axial skeleton receives less attention inWestern than English sport horses. Interest in cer-vical lesions is increasing but there is a dearth ofinformation about how this is manifested speci-cally in Western horses. Barrel horses are more likely than other Western disciplines to be assessed and treated for back prob-lems, particularly impinging spinous processes ofthe thoracolumbar signicance and evenmarked radiographic abnormalities can be clinicallyincidental. The combination of radiographic abnor-malities, evidence of back pain and, when possible toacquire, increased uptake on a bone scan, improvesthe likelihood that the changes are signicant. Fig. 4.

Conclusion It is important to understand the individual West- ern performance disciplines and the demands theyplace on the horses, which can affect the impact ofradiographic abnormalities in terms of performanceand outcome. Additionally, each discipline comeswith its own culture and expectations, which canalso affect how radiographic nding are weighed.Finally, utilize the two-part process of imageinterpretation\u2014objective assessment followed byindividual synthesis for the most accurate evalua-tion of the signicance of the radiographic ndings.

Introduction Equine athletes, or performances horses, are a unique group of horses who require a more nutri-ent-dense diet than their idle or maintenancecounterparts. Although the term is not well de-ned, most consider a horse an athlete or perfor-mance horse when they are in moderate, heavy, or very heavy work, which is dened as riding withan elevated heart rate ( /H1135090 beats per minutes) for /H113503 hours each week with a combinations of inten- sities ranging from speed work to slow work toother skilled work (e.g., jumping). 1A 500-kg ma- ture horse in moderate to very heavy exerciserequires 23 to 34.5 Mcal of digestible energy (DE)each day compared to an idle horse of the sameweight who needs only 15 Mcal daily. 1The re- quirement for other nutrients, including aminoacids, vitamins, and minerals, also increase withexercise. 1To achieve this level of nutrition, per- formance horses are commonly fed grains and con-centrates; however, forage should still make up atleast half of the ration, or more when possible. 1,2 Therefore, equine practitioners often need to ad-vise performance horse owners and managers onthe selection of forages, whether as pasture, hay,or other alternatives.2. Selecting Pasture Forages Many owners like to maximize pasture access due to the benets of grazing, including socialization, exer-cise, and a reduction in the incidence of colic, 3gastric ulcers,4stereotypical behaviors,5and osteochondritis dissecans in growing horses.6Most well-managed pastures can meet the nutritional needs of adulthorses up to moderate exercise, with voluntary drymatter intake (DMI) ranging from 1.5 to 3.1% ofbodyweight (BW). 1However, the nutrient value of pasture forage is highly variable and depends ongrazing height, 7management (e.g., fertility),8forage Minne- sota,10,11different forage types were evaluated for nutrient values by grazing horses, including cool-season Teff, an annual warm-season grass, consistently had a lowerequine DE and crude protein (CP) and greateramounts of neutral detergent ber (NDF) on a drymatter (DM) basis than alfalfa and cool-seasongrasses. 10,11Although teff had lower CP, only plasma threonine concentration was lower after 4 hours of grazing, with no effect on protein synthesis of cultured equine satellite cells, indicating thatamino acids were absorbed or available in sufcient AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 45HOW-TO SESSION: FEEDING FOR FITNESS NOTESamounts regardless of differences in the forage species.10 If an increase in pasture nutrient density is de- sired, improvements should be made to pasturemanagement, including avoidance of over-grazing,fertilizing according to soil tests, controlling weeds,and implementing a rotational grazing system.Additionally, legumes (e.g., alfalfa) can be seededinto pastures to increase DE, and longer periods ofgrazing can be offered to increase voluntary in-take. 20Interestingly, Glunk et al20found that re- stricting pasture access accelerated pasture intake,especially for horse grazing /H110219 hours each day. Unfortunately, it is not usually practical for per- formance horses to graze continuously due to train- ing and show schedules. Table 2 outlines theestimated DE intake of adult horses grazing the forages described in DeBoer et al. 10,11at various DMI. If a performance horse in heavy work is ableto meet their DE needs through grazing 2.5% oftheir BW, then most other nutritional needs, includ-ing trace minerals, are usually met. 1However, be- cause all forages are decient in sodium, a white saltblock or lose salt should always be provided. Pro-ductive pastures should be /H1135075% desired forage cover with pasture heights of 15 to 20 cm. 7-13Al- though it is not common to graze pure legumes,grazing alfalfa pastures with DMI /H113502.0% BW could meet the energy demands of horses in moderateto very heavy exercise. 1Horses in moderate toheavy work with DMI of /H113502.5% BW grazing cool- season grass or teff pastures could meet their DEthrough grazing. However, horses in very heavywork would not meet their DE requirements bygrazing teff or cool-season grass pastures and wouldrequire supplementation. This example demon-strates the importance of both DMI and forage spe-cies in m aximizing DE when grazing performance horses. Although DMI can be challenging to esti- mate, most horses grazing for 15 hours a day canconsume between 1.4 and 2.5% BW depending onthe time of year and pasture forage availability. 19 Interestingly, restricting pasture access has beenshown to accelerate pasture DMI rate, especially forhorses grazing for /H113499 hours per day. 20 3. Selecting Hay Hay is commonly fed to all classes of horses. Sim-ilar to that in pasture, nutrient density is deter- mined by forage species, management conditions(e.g., fertility), and maturity at which the hay isharvested. Selecting hay for performance horsescomes down to both physical evaluation and chemi-cal analysis. Physical Analysis All horses' hay should be physically evaluated for anumber of characteristics, including the following: 1. Species. Knowing the forage species present in the hay is important because differentforages contain different amounts of nutri-ents. 21As an example, Table 3 outlines his- torical averages and ranges of some foragenutritive values based on the major alfalfa), oat (Avena sativa cool-season annual grass) hay tested by Equi-Analytical (Ithaca, NewYork). Although forage identication takestime and practice, being able to identify ben-ecial forages also helps to rule out hay in-fested with weeds and toxic plants. 2. Maturity. Some experts will argue that for- age maturity when the hay is harvested is thegreatest driver of nutrient value. However,it is likely a combination of both speciesand maturity. More mature hay tends to behigher in structural ber components of NDFand acid detergent ber (ADF) and lower inDE. 21,22Signs of maturity are larger stems, taller plants, and more seed heads (in grasses)and flowers (in legumes). 3. Touch. Hay should be soft to the touch. Horses have sensitive mouths, lips, andtongues, and forages that are excessivelyrough can deter and limit ingestion. Rough-ness can be a result of excessive maturity,abrasives seeds heads (e.g., foxtail, Setaria species), 23and plants with spines (e.g., this-Table 2.

Staniar et al22 found a negative correlation between horse intake and maturity of teff hay. 4. Color. A rich, green color can indicate highly palatable hay with readily digestible nutri-ents. However, professionals should not gettoo hung up on color. Hays with a bleachedor faded color usually correlate with longerdrying times, rainfall while in the windrow, orstorage in sun-rich locations. Interestingly,rained-on hay may be a suitable forage if therain occurred soon after cutting, the rain wasa single or short event, the rain intensitywas higher versus a longer or lower intensityevent, and the forage was not re-wetted manytimes. 24Regardless of color and rainfall, most hays will be lacking in vitamins andsome minerals, which require supplementa-tion for all classes of horses. 1Therefore, it is best to have faded, and especially rained-on,forage analyzed. 5. Smell. All horse hay should smell clean and free of mold and dust. Horses are highly sen-sitive to dust and mold particles found inhay, 25which when inhaled can result in respi- ratory problems.26It has been suggested that hay containing less than 1,000,000 cfu/g is con- sidered relatively safe for livestock.27How- ever, it is generally accepted that horses aremore susceptible to health issues as a resultof mold exposure; therefore, it has been sug-gested that horse hay have no more than500,000 cfu/g of mold. 28If concerns about mold arise, a laboratory analysis can deter-mine mold levels. To reduce the impact ofspore inhalation during feeding, current man-agement strategies include soaking for /H1134915 minutes 29or steaming30hay. Regardless, hay exceeding 500,000 cfu/g of mold should not befed to horses. 6. Toxic Plants. All hay should be completely free of toxic plants. Most experts agree thatnon-toxic weeds should make up less than10% of hay due to the lower nutrient prole ofnon-toxic weeds. Unfortunately, there is nochemical test or forage analysis that can iden-tify toxic plants or non-toxic weeds; this mustbe done through physical evaluation. Chemical Analysis Many laboratories across the United States canevaluate hay for nutrient values; however, profes- sionals should ensure the laboratory offers anequine DE estimation and an evaluation of compo-nents used to estimate nonstructural carbohydrates(NSCs). Additionally, it is equally important that arepresentative sample is submitted to the labora-tory. Commonly suggested guidelines for most for-age nutritive values exist, but research correlatingtheir use in horse diets is lacking. Some of theforage nutritive values commonly used when evalu-ating horse hay include the following: 1. Moisture. Moisture at the time of baling is directly correlated to the formation of mold. 28 To basically eliminate the risk of mold forma-tion in the bale, hay should have /H1134915% mois- ture at the time of baling. In the absence ofwrapping and propionic acid use, hays over17% moisture have a high probability of mold-ing, whereas hays over 25% moisture pose thethreat of severe heat damage and serve as apotential re hazard. 28 2. Crude Protein. CP is a measure of the pro- tein concentration in the hay and an estima-tion of amino acid content. CP varies basedon a number of factors, including species (Ta-ble 3), maturity, 22and soil fertility.8A horse in moderate to very heavy work requires /H11350768 g of CP each day. Using average CP valuesin Table 3 and NRC requirements, 1it is high- lighted that horses would need to consume 4to 5 kg of legume hay to meet the CP needs ofhorses in moderate to very heavy work. Incomparison, these same horses would need toconsume 10 to 13 kg of oat hay to meet theirneeds. 3. Acid Detergent Fiber. ADF is a measure- ment of the insoluble ues increase:21therefore, ADF can also be used as an indicator of maturity. AlthoughTable 3. Historical Means (with Range) of Nutrient Values of Common Dried (e.g., Hay) Forage Types Tested at Equi-Analytical (Ithaca, NY)2 CP1ADF RFV, dietary requirements for ADF in the horse's diet have ADF is not valid for predictingdigestibility. 31 4. Neutral Detergent Fiber. NDF is a measure- ment of the insoluble ber, including hemicel-lulose, cellulose, ligno-cellulose, and lignin. 31 plant values increasebecause the insoluble bers provide the plantwith and rigidity as it grows 9; there- fore, NDF can also be used as an indicator ofmaturity. Although no dietary requirementsfor NDF in the horse's diet have been estab-lished, many suggest NDF values of /H1134965% will maximize horse intake. NDF has correlated with horse intake inboth hay 22and grasses to be higher in NDF than cool- season grasses9due to known differences in cell wall content; however, warm-seasongrasses are commonly fed to all classes ofhorses. 22,33Increasing the digestibility of warm-season grasses is best accomplished byharvesting hay in an earlier stage of growthand keeping pastures in a vegetative or moreimmature growth stage. 33 5. Equine DE. Measurement of DE in the hay is used to balance the energy portion of theequine diet. A 500-kg mature horse in mod-erate to very heavy exercise requires 23 to34.5 Mcal of DE each day. 1Table 4 outlines the estimated DE intake of adult horsesconsuming hay at various DMI using DE val-ues summarized in Table 3. Due to their in-creased energy requirements, performancehorses are commonly fed legume hays or le-gume mixed hays. Consuming /H113502.0% BW le- gume hay would meet, or exceed, the energydemands of horses in moderate to very heavyexercise. 1Horses in moderate to heavy work with DMI of /H113502.5% BW consuming cool-sea-son grass, Bermudagrass, and oat hays would meet their daily DE requirement. However,horses in very heavy work would not meettheir DE requirements by consuming thesehays. Similar to pasture, this example dem-onstrates the importance of both DMI andforage species in maximizing DE when feed-ing performance horses hay. 6. Relative Feed Value. Relative feed value (RFV) 34is commonly used when selecting hay intended to feed cattle but is not commonlyused when assessing horse hay. Generally,RFV can be used as a guideline in identifyinghay quality because greater RFVs tend to re-flect higher quality hays with greater intakeand digestibility potential. Other nutrient values can be tested for in forage,including NSC components, vitamins, and minerals.Vitamin and mineral requirements do increase withworkload. 1Although NSC requirements have not been established for performance horses, dietaryguidelines have been suggested for horses with poly-saccharide storage myopathy 35and insulin resis- tance.36In these cases, complete diets with /H1134910 and 12% NSC have been suggested for horses diag-nosed with polysaccharide storage myopathy andinsulin resistance, respectively. 4. Conclusions Performances horses require a more nutrient-densediet; therefore, professionals should focus on select-ing legumes or less mature forages for these horses.In pastured performance horses, this means maxi-mizing grazing time and access to well-maintainedpastures that include more nutrient-dense forages,including legumes. When selecting hay, physicalevaluation should include identication of the spe-cies and maturity and sensory evaluation for touch,smell, and color. Although loosely dened, com-monly accepted chemical analysis of better qualityhay include mold counts of /H11349500,000 cfu/g, /H1134945%, and NDF of CP and DE requirements for performance horses are welldened and tend to be more easily met when feed-ing alfalfa hay, mixes, or less mature grass hays.Although the focus of this paper is forage selec- tion, care should be taken prior to feeding forages(and grains and supplements) to ensure a bal-anced ration.

Duren, BS, MS, PhD, PAS*; and Tania A. Cubitt, BS, MS, PhD Authors' addresses: Performance Horse 967 Road, \u00a9 2020 AAEP. 1. Introduction A performance horse is one that is regularly given forced exercise. The intensity and duration ofexercise varies greatly with different types ofperformance activities or disciplines. Nutrientrequirements for horses performing different in-tensities of exercise have been established andclassied under the intensities of light, moderate,heavy, and very heavy. 1The nutrient require- ments for energy, protein, macro minerals, traceminerals, and vitamins are different for horsesperforming these different intensities of exercise.This creates a need to select different concentratesdepending on type and duration of exercise. Feedcompanies manufacturing concentrates for perfor-mance horses will vary the amounts of essential nutrients, and even the sources of these nutrients,to satisfy the nutrient requirements of the perfor-mance horse and to appeal to consumers. Feedmanufacturers will also write feeding instructionsto account for horses performing at different in-tensities. The challenge for the consumer, andultimately for the veterinarian assisting theconsumer, is to determine which concentrate isbest suited for that individual horse or group ofhorses.2. Forage The topic of selecting a forage for performance horses has been previously discussed in these Pro- ceedings.2However, it is important to re-empha- size that high-quality forage (baled hay, pasture,hay cubes/pellets, chaff) can be a rich source of en-ergy, protein, minerals, and vitamins for perfor- mance horses. If performance horses are getting a large proportion of essential nutrients from con-sumption of high-quality forage, the horse will re-quire less supplemental concentrate to satisfy therequirements for those nutrients. Previous studieshave highlighted that feeding increased volumes ofgrain increase the risk of digestive upset; 3thus, feeding the minimum amount of concentrate neces-sary to satisfy nutrient requirements and maintain proper body condition can have a positive impact onhealth. Selection of different forage type and thetiming of specic forage-type meals have also beenreported to have a positive influence on minimiz-ing the risk of developing equine gastric ulcersyndrome in performance horses. 4-6Therefore, it is recommended that all performance horses befed free-choice, high-quality forage. Once the im-pact and nutrient contribution of the forage por-tion of the diet is known, the diet can be 50 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: FEEDING FOR FITNESS NOTEScomplemented with the proper concentrate for the performance horse. 3. Nutrient Requirements of Performance Horses All performance horses require energy, protein, min-erals, and vitamins. The requirements for theseessential nutrients have been established by peer-reviewed science, with a complete review of the re-quirements available from the National ResearchCouncil. 1The nutrient requirements of horses are expressed on a body weight (BW) basis as theamount of nutrient required per day. As the inten-sity and duration of exercise increase, the require-ments for these essential nutrients generallyincrease. For example, a 500-kg horse in light ex-ercise would have a digestible energy requirement of20 Mcal/day. Increasing the intensity to moderate exercise results in a 16.5% increase in digestible en-ergy requirement to 23.3 Mcal/day. 1Nutrient re- quirement for protein, minerals, and vitamins alsoincrease with exercise intensity. To satisfy the nutri-ent requirements of a performance horse as it movesfrom light exercise to exercise of higher intensity andduration will require the selection of a concentratecapable of delivering more nutrients. To evaluate thenutrient prole of the concentrate, a reliable source ofinformation exists in the text of a concentrate feed tag. 4. Nutrient Prole of Concentrates\u2014The Feed Tag Concentrates formulated for horses will have differ-ent amounts of energy, protein, fat, ber, minerals,and vitamins. Horse feed manufacturers in theUnited States are required by law to have a feed tagindicating select nutrition data. The exact dataand method of listing data is controlled by individualstates under the umbrella of the Association ofAmerican Feed Control Ofcials (AAFCO). 7Re- quired information on an equine feed tag includes product name, purpose statement, guaranteed analy-sis,ingredient listing, feeding directions, manufac- turer's or distributor's name and address, andweight statement. An equine feed tag gives a reg-ulated, reliable means of making product compari-sons and serves as the initial basis for making product selections. While the feed tag contains a signicant amount of information, there are severalitems to review that will make selecting a concen-trate for a performance horse easier. Purpose Statement The purpose statement indicates the class of horsefor which the concentrate was formulated. Concen-trates for horses will have one of the following in-tended purposes: growing, broodmare, maintenance,or performance. If regular forced exercise is beingconducted, the horse should be fed a concentrateintended for a \"performance\" horse. Feeds de-signed for growth, pregnancy/lactation, mainte-nance, or seniors are not targeted toward thenutrient requirements of a performance horse and therefore they are not the best choice. For exam-ple, feeding an adult performance horse with gooddentition a low-calorie, complete \"senior\" feed at arate below manufacturer's feeding guidelines is notappropriate. A complete senior feed is designed fora horse with poor dentition and contains a high bercontent, low calorie content, and low nutrient forti-cation, which is not suitable for a performancehorse. Complete feeds are intended to fully or par- tially replace the forage portion of the diet. Sincecomplete feeds are formulated and fortied to replaceforage in the diet, the feeding rates of these productsare typically very high in the range of 1%-1.5% ofBW/horse/day. This high recommended daily intakemakes feeding below recommended levels probablewhen horses still have access to hay. Even if theperformance horse does not require an abundance ofcalories (energy) these complete senior feeds do notcontain the proper vitamin/mineral fortication whenfed below manufacturers' feeding recommendations. Guaranteed Analysis The guaranteed analysis will give nutrient contentof a concentrate in standard units of measure.The guaranteed analysis from one feed can then beeasily compared to another feed. It must be under-stood that guaranteed analysis statements do notinclude all of the nutrients in a feed. For example,one item that is not listed as part of the guaranteedanalysis statement is energy (calorie) content of thefeed. AAFCO's omission of an energy value for feedmakes it difcult to determine suitability of feeds forhorses exercising at different intensities. The en-ergy (calorie) content of feed can be acquired directlyfrom the feed manufacturer, if requested. How-ever, other information on a feed tag will give clues to the energy content of the product. For example,feeds with higher levels of crude fat will generallyhave a higher calorie content compared to feeds withlower fat content. When sugar levels of feed arelisted, feeds with higher sugar will have a higherenergy content compared to lower sugar feeds, pro-vided the levels of fat are the same. Items to payattention to on the guaranteed analysis includecrude protein, crude fat, crude ber, calcium, phos-phorus, and vitamin E. For performance horses, the target crude protein should be a minimum of11%-13% since protein and amino acids are vital forboth development and repair of muscle and bone.A minimum crude fat level of 6% is desired, since fatis a safe, effective energy source for performancehorses. The crude ber guarantee is more difcultto interpret since ber can originate from \"hay\" sources or from \"super ber\" sources such as beetpulp and soybean hulls. The energy value is muchhigher with super ber sources of ber comparedto hay sources of ber. Generally, the ingredientstatement can be referred to for the identication ofber sources. If the feed does not include superbers, the ber content of a performance feed shouldbe less than 15%. If super bers are included in theingredient statement, an acceptable ber content as AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 51HOW-TO SESSION: FEEDING FOR FITNESShigh as 20% is acceptable. With respect to calcium and phosphorus, there should be more calcium inthe feed compared to phosphorus. The ideal ratioof these two nutrients is 1.5-2 parts calcium to 1part phosphorus. The nal item to evaluate in theguaranteed analysis is vitamin E content. The vi-tamin E content should be greater than 100 IU/lb.This is one nutrient for which the phrase, \"more isbetter,\" actually holds true. A high vitamin E con-tent is desired due to poor vitamin E stability instored forage. Ingredient Statement The ingredient statement contains valuable infor-mation since it allows comparison of ingredientsutilized in the manufacturing of the feed. Underfederal law, AAFCO requires all ingredients to belisted in descending order of predominance byweight in the product. 6Two limitations with ingre- dient statements are rst, it does not allow themanufacturer to designate the quality or grade ofingredient utilized in the product. So, comparingoats on one tag versus oats on another tag does notspeak to quality of the oat. The second limitationis with the terms used to list ingredients: individ-ual terms versus collective terms. The individualterms list the actual ingredients such as oats, corn,and barley whereas the collective term allows themanufacturer to utilize the term \"grain products\"instead of the names of individual grains. Com-parison of feed tags, one with individual terms and the other with collective terms, is nearly impossibleto gain meaningful information. When looking at afeed tag with individual ingredients listed, selectionof feeds with processed grains such as oats, corn, and barley will yield more energy compared to feeds con-taining grain byproducts such as wheat middlings.The inclusion of alternative energy sources such asvegetable oils, beet pulp, and soybean hulls is alsobenecial. These energy sources are very safe to feedperformance horses and their inclusion decreases thereliance on cereal grain as the sole energy source. Directions for Use The feeding directions are important because theyrepresent the amount of commercial concentrate(lbs/day or % of horse BW/day) that is necessary tosatisfy the nutrient requirement of the horse. Thefeeding directions are based on the weight, activity,and nutrient requirements of the horse. Recom-mended feeding rates have a very specic purposeand are intended to serve as a guide for properusage. They are not there simply to drive higherconsumption rates and to sell more feed. It is crit-ical the client feed the recommended amount of con-centrate per day otherwise the product will notprovide the correct nutrition. If the horse requires more or less concentrate to maintain proper bodycondition than is recommended on the feeding tag, adifferent product should be selected. For example,a horse in a high body condition may not require themanufacturer's recommended minimum amount ofconcentrate necessary to satisfy nutrient require-ments without gaining weight. For this horse, alow-intake, more nutrient-dense feed would beappropriate. 5. Selecting a Concentrate To select a concentrate for a performance horse, theequine practitioner has two methods that can beutilized. The rst is the mathematical method in- volving the chemical analysis of ingredients, determi-nation of nutrient requirements, and mathematicalcalculation to select the type and amount of concen- trate to satisfy the horse's nutrient requirements.The second method is to approximate the value offorage and utilize body condition of the horse toestimate the type and amount of concentrate neces-sary for the performance horse. Mathematical Method The mathematical method is a full-ration analy-sis. The practitioner would begin by uniformlysampling the hay being fed to the horse. 8Since hay would vary from batch to batch, the analysis would need to be conducted with each new load ofhay received by the client. The representative haysample would then be sent to the laboratory forchemical analysis to determine nutrient prole.The nutrient prole of the forage would then bemultiplied by the amount (weight) of forage fed tothe horse on a daily basis. If performance horsesare fed free-choice high-quality forage, it will pro-vide a signicant source of nutrients reducing the amount of concentrate that must be fed to satisfy nutrient requirements. A mature horse would typ-ically consume from 1.5%-2.5% of BW in dry forageper day. Conversely, if poor-quality hay is fed, thehorse will consume less forage and require higheramounts of concentrate. The second step is to de-termine the work intensity of the horse, which willultimately determine the nutrient requirement forthe horse. Light exercise is described as exercisewith a mean heart rate, over the entire exercisebout, of 80 beats/min for a duration of 1-3 hours/week. Moderate exercise is described as exercisewith a mean heart rate of 90 beats/min for a dura-tion of 3-5 hours/week. Heavy exercise is describedas exercise with a mean heart rate of 110 beats/minfor a duration of 4-5 hours/week. Finally, veryheavy exercise is described as exercise with a mean heart rate of 110-150 beats/min for a duration of1 hour per/week if done at full-speed to 6-12hours/week if done at a slower speed. Examplesof performance activities are listed in Table 1. The next step is to subtract the nutrients provided by forage from the nutrient requirement of the ex-ercising horse. This will provide the amount of nu-trients that must be supplied by the concentrate portion of the diet. The nal step is to evaluate feedtags from concentrates intended for performancehorses to determine which one provides the desired 52 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: FEEDING FOR FITNESSamount of nutrients at a feeding rate that maintains proper body condition of the horse. There are severalsoftware programs that can do these calculations. 9-11 If the practitioner does not feel comfortable with thismethod, they can consult with an equine nutritionistto obtain a ration evaluation. Approximate Method The method of selecting the proper concentrate for aperformance horse is quicker, albeit not as accurate,as the mathematical method. In this method, beginby ensuring the client is providing the horse withfree-choice access to high-quality forage. Next, weigh the amount (lbs/day) of concentrate currently beingfed to the horse. The third step is to determinewhether the amount of concentrate that is cu rrently being fed is properly maintaining optimum bodycondition of the performance horse. If the horseis too thin or too fat, the amount of concentrate willneed to be modied. The nal step is to select aconcentrate intended for a performance horse thatcan be fed within the range necessary to optimizebody condition of the horse. This method of select-ing a concentrate does not rely on conducting anobjective analysis of the diet. The practitioner doesnot collect and submit a forage sample for analysis.Instead, it is a subjective method to manage bodycondition of the horse by selecting a concentrate thatts into the feeding range necessary to maintainproper body condition. This method relies on trustor positive experience with the concentrate manu-facturer and the expertise of their nutritional staffto formulate all of the nutrients necessary for aperformance horse in that daily feeding rate. 6. Practical Examples of Appropriate Concentrates for Performance Horses The equine practitioner will care for performance horses under a variety of exercise intensities. Thefollowing are several common types of exercise andconcentrates that would be appropriate for thesesituations. Infrequent Light Exercise An example of this type of exercise would be occa-sional riding done mostly at a walk or slow trot, suchas trail riding or flat work done in an arena. Ifthese horses are given free-choice access to high-quality forage (hay/pasture) they often do not re-quire a signicant amount of additional energy(calories) to maintain body condition. Many clientswill select a concentrate designed for a performancehorse or even a \"senior\" but then underfeed theproduct according to manufacturer's guidelines.Underfeeding any concentrate will result in the horse's nutrient requirements not being met. In-stead of a concentrate, these horses are better suitedfor a pelleted, low-intake, concentrated source ofprotein, vitamins, and minerals. These productsare called ration balancers or supplement pellets.The daily intake, depending on manufacturer andfortication level, is between 1 and 2 lbs/horse/dayfor a 1,000-lb animal. Therefore, the rst exampleof a \"performance\" horse would not be fed a grain-based concentrate, but instead be fed a ration bal-ancer pellet. Frequent Light Exercise An example of exercise would be 4-5 days per week,with exercise done at walk (40%), trot (50%), andcanter (10%). The exercise duration would be ap-proximately 30-40 minutes per day. These horseswould be involved in recreational riding and show-ing and require a modest energy intake beyond thecalories provided by high-quality forage. The typi-cal concentrate intake would be 3-5 lb per 1000-lbhorse/day. These horses are best suited with alower fat (4%-6%), low to moderate protein (11%-13%), concentrate formulated for performancehorses. Moderate Exercise An example of moderate exercise would be 4-5 daysper week, with exercise done at walk (30%), trot(55%), canter (10%), and specialized training (5%).Examples of specialized training include jum ping, cutting, or other skill work. The exercise durationwould be approximately 45-60 minutes per day.These horses may be involved in frequent showing, alesson/school program, western speed events such asroping, medium-level dressage, or ranch work. Thesehorses would require a moderate amount of energybeyond that which could be supplied by free-choice forage. The typical intake would be in the 5-8 lbper 1000-lb horse/day. These horses are best suitedwith a moderate fat (8%-10%), low to moderate pro-tein (11%-13%) concentrate formulated for perfor-mance horses.Table 1. Example of Performance Activities of Horses in Light, Moderate, Heavy, and Very Heavy Exercise Categories Exercise Category Types of Events Light Recreational riding, initial stages of training programs, show horses (occasional) ModerateSchool horses, recreational riding, breaking/training, ranch work, show horses (more frequent) HeavyRanch work, polo, show horses (strenuous), low-medium level eventing, race training (middle stages) Very heavy Racing (Quarter Horse, Thoroughbred, Standardbred, endurance), elite 3-day eventing SESSION: FEEDING FOR FITNESSHeavy Exercise An example of heavy exercise would be 4-6 days per week, with exercise done at walk (20%), trot(50%), canter (15%), and specialized training(15%). Examples of specialized training includegalloping, jumping, polo, eventing, or other skillwork. The exercise duration would be approxi-mately 60 minutes per day. They may be involved in frequent showing with travel, polo, low-to-medium-level 3-day eventing, higher levels of dres-sage, Grand Prix-level jumping, and enduranceriding. These horses would require signicantamounts of energy beyond that which could be sup-plied by free-choice forage. The typical intakewould be in the 8-10 lb per 1000-lb horse/day.These higher-fat (10%-14%), moderate-protein (13%-15%) concentrate for-mulated for performance horses. The extra fat isrequired to meet energy requirements while the ex-tra protein helps build and repair muscle and bonetissue. Very Heavy Exercise An example of very heavy exercise would be 4-6days per week, with exercise done at high speedsuch as galloping or sprinting for a duration of /H1102110 minutes/day. This type of exercise may also in-clude exercise done for longer duration (1-2 hours/day) with a heavy emphasis on skill and enduranceactivities. These horses are typically involved inflat track racing (Thoroughbred and Quarter Horse),Standardbred racing, elite 3-day event horses, andhigh-goal polo horses. They require the majority oftheir energy from the concentrate portion of the diet.The typical concentrate intake would be in the12-15 lbs per 1000-lb horse/day. These horses arebest suited medium-fat per-formance horses. Very high-fat diets are typicallyavoided for these horses since the sprinting activi-ties utilize a higher muscle-glycogen reserve, andhigh-fat feeds are not as palatable when fed inthe amounts necessary to maintain body condition.The extra protein is essential to help build and re-pair muscle and bone tissue. 7. Summary In summary, begin feeding performance horses byproviding free access to fresh, clean water. Thenext step is to provide adequate energy; this is theonly dietary factor in which adequacy can be visu-ally determined with the use of body condition eval-uation. If too much energy (too many calories) isfed, the horse gains weight or becomes fat; on theother hand, if not enough energy (too few calories) isfed, the horse becomes thin or loses weight. Thestatus of other critical nutrients cannot be assessedby visual assessment alone. Determination of di-etary adequacy for other critical nutrients can onlybe done with ration analysis. To provide energy tothe performance horse, begin with feeding good-quality forage (pasture/hay) and add additional en-ergy with the use of a combination of starch, fat, andsuper-bers. Utilizing an appropriate concentrateto complement available forages will ensure all nu-trients are being met in the performance horse'sdiet.

Introduction What is a performance horse? When is a horse considered an athlete? Generally, athletic horseshave higher energy and nutrient requirementsthan adult horses at maintenance. The 2007 Na-tional Research Council's (NRC) Nutrient Re-quirements of Horses publication denes athleticcategories (Table 1) and weekly workloads (Table2) that provide context to published energy andnutrient requirements for the equine athlete. 1 NRC athletic categories do not capture all athleticdisciplines, and average energy requirements forwork may overestimate the needs of the over-weight performance horse. A horse's energy re-quirement is influenced by activity but also byindividual factors (metabolism and demeanor).Horses used for pleasure riding have higher oddsof obesity than horses used in competition. 2 Generally, for athletes, a lean body condition conveys an athletic advantage due to a higher power-to-weight ratio. Furthermore, equine obe-sity reduces evaporative efciency,4increases insulin dysregulation,5-7and increases the risk of lamin- itis,8,9none of which are benecial to general health or athletic performance. Therefore, body conditionscore (BCS) 10,11(Table 3) should be considered whendetermining performance horses' energy requirements and subsequently building the diet/ration. Case There are numerous disciplines for the equine ath- lete. Although the details regarding a single equine athlete will not be representative of other equineathletes (discipline, energy and nutrient require-ments, feeds available, and management), the gen-eral process of conducting a nutrition assessmentand building a ration is the same. A 14-year-old[some breed] gelding with a body weight of 636 kg(1,400 lbs) and a BCS of 7/9 (Table 1) 10,11will be used as an example case for illustration. In thisexample, the gelding is worked, on average, 5 hoursper week, consisting of a total of 90 minutes (1.5hours) walk, 165 minutes (2.75 hours) trot, 30 min-utes (0.5 hour) canter, and 15 minutes (0.25 hour)jumping. According to the NRC, this work classi-es as a \"moderate\" workload. BCS and Estimating Ideal Body Weight First, the target BCS should be determined. Al-though body condition scoring is subjective, it corre-lates well with body fat percent. 12For the athlete, the author's preferred BCS is 4/9-5/9. However,the type of athletic discipline often influences the own-er/caregiver/rider/trainer- desired BCS. In some AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 55HOW-TO SESSION: FEEDING FOR FITNESS NOTESdisciplines, a BCS of 4/9-5/9 is not considered desir- able. There are consequences to being overweightand the owner/caregiver/rider/trainer should be ed-ucated as to these consequences. However, the au-thor recognizes that the target BCS will likely besome consensus in balancing ideal and what isdeemed acceptable in certain disciplines. For thegelding in this example, the target BCS is set at a5/9. Second, the gelding's estimated ideal or target body weight should be determined. True ideal bodyweight will be that when the gelding has achieved aBCS of 5/9. In general, each BCS represents 22.7kg (50 lbs). Therefore, to drop 2 BCS points (from a7/9 to a 5/9), the gelding would need to lose anestimated 45.4 kg (100 lbs); thus, the estimated tar-get body weight would be 591 kg (1,300 lbs) (1,400lbs minus 100 lbs). Once the target body weight isestablished, then the recommended diet/ration maybe designed. When designing a diet, water, energy,and essential nutrients, along with DM, should becarefully considered. The goal is to promote weightloss while meeting essential nutrient needs and re-ducing the risk of metabolic and gastrointestinalabnormalities (e.g., colic). Water Water is the most important ingredient in anyhorse's ration. An old myth was to not lead a hothorse to water. Water should not be restricted;however, do not let a horse drink so much at oncewhere they colic due to rapid gastric distention.Water intake and requirements are influenced bymany factors, including total dry matter consumed, 1 dry matter content of feed (higher with hay vs.pasture), 13protein intake,14sweat production, wa-ter salinity,15water temperature,1,16and ambient temperature. Energy and Dry Matter A horse's diet may be designed based on a dry mat- ter target (DM) or a digestible energy target. Thissection will review the use of both methods. Feed-ing based on a DM target is more practical, althoughless precise. When feeding to a DM target (i.e.,generally when trying to achieve weight loss) the author targets a daily DM goal of 1.5% bodyweight. Therefore, the 591-kg (1,300-lb) horsewould be fed 8.9 kg (19.5 lbs) DM. If the foragehas 92% DM, then the horse would consume 9.6 kg(21.1 lbs) as fed (AF; 8.9 kg DM/0.92 /H110059.7 kg or 21.3 lb AF). Feeding by dry matter is quick andeasy because all that is needed is the target bodyweight. However, depending on the forage qual-ity, the total daily calories fed could be quite dif-ferent. For example, if a horse is fed a relativelyhigh-quality grass hay with 2.2 Mcal/kg DM (1.0Mcal/lb DM) vs. a relatively poor-quality grass haywith 1.8 Mcal/kg DM (0.8 Mcal/lb DM), then dailycalories would be 21.3 Mcal and 17.5 Mcal, respec-tively, a difference of 3.9 Mcal per day or 121 Mcalper month. Feeding based on a digestible energy target is more precise; however, a forage nutrient analysis isneeded. When feeding to a digestible energy target, the NRC web-based program (https://nrc88.nas.edu/nrh/) may be used to identify thehorse's energy requirement. According to theNRC, 1a 591-kg (1,300-lb) working/training horse at 27.6 Mcal digestible energy (1 Mcal /H110051 kcal/H110051 calorie). However, this does not account for needed negative energy balanced to promoteweight loss. For weight loss, the author generallytargets NRC low adult maintenance requirements(30.3 kcal/kg 1ideal body weight), which would translate to 17.9 kcal for the example gelding.Although the low adult maintenance requirementdoes not account for the level of work, it is importantto consider that energy requirements vary by indi-vidual and some individuals require substantial en-ergy restriction.Table 1.

For exam-ple, if the 591-kg (1,300-lb) gelding in moderatework was currently consuming 24.6 Mcal digestibleenergy per day, then recommending a diet that pro-vides 27.6 Mcal (per NRC) would promote weightgain. If the gelding was consuming 24.6 Mcal perday, then a more appropriate energy goal would be80% of current intake or 19.7 Mcal. Another con-sideration is if the horse's activity level has changed,as digestible energy provision should match energyexpenditure (e.g., reducing concentrate during re-covery and off-season). Some horses are rather ef-cient and require a signicant degree of restriction,below 30.3 kcal/lb ideal body weight. 17For the ac- tive horse, severe energy restriction is hopefully notneeded and certainly should not be a starting point.Regardless of where the energy goal is initiated (e.g.,27.6 moderate 591-kg geld-ing), the appropriateness of the plan will be deter-mined through strategic monitoring (see Monitoringsection). Generally, a performance horse's energy needs can be met by forage, concentrate, or a combinationof the two. However, concentrates (e.g., commer-cial performance feeds, grains, and brans) are moreenergy dense than forages (e.g., 2.6-3.3 Mcal/kg AF)and, thus, are generally not indicated for the over-weight performance horse. Horses generally ob-tain more than 50% of energy requirements frommicrobial fermentation, specically volatile fatty ac-ids. 18,19Although the horse in heavy activity is not likely to be able to meet energy needs with foragealone, horses at a lower level of activity and lowerenergy need are more likely to meet their energyneed with forage alone. Furthermore, the insolubleber in forage (e.g., cellulose) is slowly fermented bygut microbes, supports a neutral hindgut pH andsymbiotic gut microbiota, and thus promotes overallgut health. For this example, if the available grass hay con- tains 2.0 Mcal/kg DM (0.909 Mcal/lb DM) and 92%DM (average per Equi-Analytical grass hay data 20), then the energy density may be converted to an AFbasis by multiplying the percent DM (92%) 20by the Mcal/lb AF). highly dependent on the stage of maturityat which it is consumed or cut to make hay. Ide-ally, a forage analysis would be conducted andshould include an estimate of digestible energy (cal-culated from analyses of crude protein, fat, struc-tural carbohydrates, non-structural carbohydrates[NSCs], and mineral content), neutral detergent -ber (NDF), and crude protein. The NDF representsforage cell wall (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin)and is a negative indicator of quality and a positiveindicator of forage bulk. Therefore, the higher theNDF, the bulkier the forage and thus more lling,which is helpful for the horse with a high voluntaryDM intake. 21,22Anecdotally, grass hay with /H1102270% NDF on a DM basis is high in that horses may not beable to eat enough to maintain a healthy weight. If the daily energy requirement for the gelding is 17.9 Mcal, then the gelding would need 9.9 kg (17.9Mcal/1.8 Mcal/kg AF) of this grass hay AF per day,which translates to 9.1 kg (9.9 /H110030.92) or 1.5% of ideal body weight (9.1/591 kg body weight). Con-versely, if the daily energy requirement for the geld-ing is 27.6 Mcal, then feed 15.3 kg (27.6 Mcal/1.8Mcal/kg AF) of average quality grass hay AF perday, which translates to 14.1 kg DM (15.3 kg /H110030.92) or 2.4% of ideal body weight. Anticipated daily DMintake for moderate work load is 2.25% body weight(Table 4). 1Therefore, neither scenario is expecting the gelding to consume too much, thus concentratesdo not appear to be needed to meet energy needs.Furthermore, both scenarios provide at least 1.5% ofBW in DM per day. Non-Structural Carbohydrates Diets high in NSCs (includes sugars, starch, andfructan) increase the risk of insulin dysregulationand laminitis, which are associated with obe-sity. 23,24Activity positively influences insulin reg- ulation; thus, active overweight horses may have alower risk of insulin dysregulation. Regardless,limiting NSCs will likely limit the risk of insulindysregulation. Although some authors suggestlimiting NSCs to /H1102110% of diet DM, the author targets an NSC level lower than the current diet.Forage is lower in NSCs than concentrates, particu- larly grain-based concentrates. Grasses and alfalfa are similar in NSC content, although the high endfor grasses is higher than for alfalfa. 20,25Hay may be soaked to reduce water-soluble carbohydrates(sugars and fructan) in forage. 26However, some water-soluble nutrients in the DM are lost. ForageNSCs should be considered along with forage qualityand energy density. If feeding based on DM, theforage with the lower NSC concentration would bean ideal choice. In addition to being more energydense, concentrates are generally higher in NSCthan forage, which can reduce insulin sensitivity 23 and increase the risk of colic, especially withouttransition/gradual introduction. 27 Nutrient Requirements The requirements for several essential nutrients areconsidered to be higher in the athletic horse. Ac-Table 4. NRC 20071Anticipated Dry Matter Intake by Workload WorkloadAnticipated DM Intake (% BW) Light exercise 2 Moderate exercise 2.25 Heavy exercise and very heavy exercise 2.5 DM, dry matter; BW, body weight 58 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 591-kg (1,300-lb) working/ training horse at moderate work load (i.e., the example gelding) requires 908 g crude protein, 39 glysine, 41 g calcium, 25 g phosphorus, 21 g sodium,63 g chloride, 38 g potassium, 14 g magnesium, 18 gsulfur, 0.6 mg cobalt, 118 mg copper, 4.1 mg iodine,473 mg iron, 473 mg manganese, 473 mg 67 mg thiamine, and 27 mgriboflavin. Regardless of the energy need of the in dividual, the author sets essential nutrient goals to matchthe NRC requirements for the given physiologicstatus/life stage. Otherwise said, regardless ofwhether the gelding's actual energy requirementwas 27.6 or 17.9 Mcal per day, the essential nu-trient goal should still be set as that required fora working/training horse at moderate workload. Generally, if forage meets the energy needs, it will also meet the protein and amino acid needs. How-ever, when instituting a prescribed weight loss plan,this is not always the case. According to Equi-An-alytical, grass hay contains 109 ( /H1100618) grams of pro- tein per kg on a DM basis or 100 grams of proteinper kg on an AF basis. 20If feeding 9.9 or 15.3 kg of average quality grass hay, then the protein pro- vided would be 990 or 1,530 grams per day, re-spectively, which exceed the 908 grams requireddaily for the 591-kg (1,300-lb) working/traininghorse at moderate work load. Excessive dietaryprotein is not benecial, as protein positively in-fluences water requirements due to increased en-dogenous heat production and increased need forrenal nitrogen excretion. Protein metabolism gen- erates more heat production, as compared to carbo- hydrate and fat metabolism, which increasessweat production, subsequently increasing waterand electrolyte losses. Furthermore, increasednitrogen (ammonia) in the urine can reduce barnair quality. Forage needs to be complemented with a ration balancer to provide the micronutrients that theforage does not. Furthermore, if the forage doesnot meet protein requirements, then supplementalprotein is needed. Although the concentration andavailability of nutrients in forage varies by region,forage format (fresh pasture vs. hay) and soil type,several micronutrients (e.g., sodium, chloride,copper, zinc, selenium, and vitamin E) may be de-cient if forage is the only source of nutrients. It isimportant to consider regional differences in forageavailability and nutrient content, as themicronutrients needed will vary. Sodium chlo-ride may be met by providing free choice access toa white or trace mineral (/H1135095% sodium chloride) block, preferably near a fresh water source. Addi-tional nutrients may be provided with balancer pel-lets, which are highly fortied commercial feeds andare meant to be fed in small quantities. Balancerpellets are a good option to balance the forage be-cause (1) it gives the caregiver something to feed,which is often an important factor in the human-animal-bond, and (2) they are generally readilyconsumed and, thus, easier to monitor intake. Equine-specic granular or block-type vitamin-mineral products may be fed free choice, preferably near a water source, but intake is generally moredifcult to monitor, particularly when offered in agroup setting. Antioxidant requirements, like for vitamin E, are higher for athletes, as free radicals are a byproductof energy metabolism. Vitamin E is generally ade-quate in fresh/pasture forage, but is decient inprocessed forage (e.g., hay). 28 Monitoring Body weight and BCS should be evaluatedmonthly. The target weight loss rate is 0.5-1.0BCS point per month or 11.3-22.7 kg (25-50 lbs)per month. If weight loss is too slow or has notoccurred, check compliance. If the caregiver hasbeen compliant but weight loss has been slow,then further reduce energy by 10-20%. For anyadjustment, be cognizant of daily DM provision.Although the author prefers not to drop daily DMbelow 1.5% of target body weight, 1.0% of targetbody weight should be used as a minimum tar-get. 17,29The author recommends working with a veterinary nutritionist when daily DM falls below1.5% body weight. If daily DM drops below 1.5%of target body weight, consider implementing ameans to slow forage consumption (e.g., slow hayfeeders) and monitoring more closely for colic.If the caregiver has not been compliant, investi- gate the cause and help the caregiver establish a management plan that is sustainable.

Introduction Horses are non-ruminant herbivores, highly adapted to the slow intake of a plant-based, high-ber diet.However, modern-day management practices of per-formance horses have shifted toward overall reducedaccess to forage and increased reliance on the practiceof meal-feeding. This shift is not only counter to bestfeeding and management practices to promote optimaldigestive health, but it has placed equine athletes at ahigher risk of gastrointestinal disturbances such asgastric ulcers, recurrent colic, and conditions involvinginflammation of the bowel. Clinical signs of thesedisturbances may include irritability, weight loss, poorappetite, chronic diarrhea, among others. Whileproper diagnosis and appropriate medical treatment in these patients is critical, it is also important toevaluate the horse's diet and feeding managementpractices. Performance horses are typically managed under conditions that are not conducive to optimal diges-tive health. Increased connement in stalls andmeal feeding affect the physiology of the digestivetract by altering both intestinal motility and themicrobiome environment, increasing colic risk. 1 Feeding large, high-starch grain meals that exceed/H110221 g/kg body weight (BW)/meal, a practice commonin horses with high dietary energy requirements,has been linked to greater risk of nonglandular gas- 2The drugs that ismore commonly observed in the performance horsepopulation has been associated with alterations inintestinal permeability (\"leaky gut\") and an in-creased risk of right colitis. 3,4Fortunately, basic equine nutrition principles for promoting gooddigestive health can be applied in such a way toeither 1) maintain and/or improve athletic perfor-mance or 2) support medical treatment of perfor-mance horses suffering from gastrointestinaldisease. This paper will outline specic nutritionand feeding management guidelines that promoteoptimal digestive health, with a focus on the perfor-mance horse. 2. Feeding and Management Practices Forages It is a long standing recommendation for horses to receive a minimum of 1% BW in forage per day inorder to maintain proper digestive function, butthis minimum recommendation is commonly over-looked in performance horse management situations.And while 1% BW is the minimum recommendation,1.5-2% BW is a better target in most cases, and it isrecommended that forage make up at least 50% of the AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 61HOW-TO SESSION: daily ration when possible.5Forage require- ments can be met by both preserved forages (long- stemmed hay, hay pellets, chopped hay, andcommercially available forage-replacement alterna-tives) and fresh pasture. Forage intake while on pas-ture can vary greatly, and total dry matter intakewhile grazing is dependent upon several factors, in-cluding total hours of access and overall pasture qual-ity. Studies have shown that horses allowed 4 hoursor less of daily pasture access will consume 0.22 /H110060.02 kg DM/100 kg BW/hour, and horses allowed more than4 hours of daily pasture access will consume 0.11 /H11006 0.02 kg DM/100 kg BW/hour. 6For example, if a 500-kg horse were allowed to graze on pasture for 6hours per day, dry-matter intake would be expected at3.3 kg, which is equivalent to approximately 3.7 kg hay(as-fed basis). Chewing long-stemmed forage increases saliva output, and saliva contains bicarbonate, which helpsto buffer acid secretions in the stomach. 7Maximiz- ing access to forage will increase time spent chew-ing, as well as potentially decreasing boredom andstress while conned. Horses in a natural settingare estimated to graze for approximately 14 hourseach day. 8When stalled, the horse's opportunity to forage is limited, and the utilization of small-holehay nets (3.2-cm and 4.4-cm openings) as opposed tofeeding from the stall floor is an effective way toincrease the overall time to consumption of hay andbetter mimics grazing conditions. 9 Perhaps the most signicant feature of forage in terms of digestive health is that it supplies the fer-mentable ber required by the hindgut microbes tofunction properly. When feeding a hindgut fer-menter such as the horse, maintaining a healthypopulation of hindgut microorganisms plays a criti-cal role in not only digestion, but overall horsehealth. Together with their genetic material andinteractions with each other in their environment,these hindgut microbes are a part of a diverse andcomplex ecosystem referred to as the \"equine micro-biome.\" The importance of a healthy microbiomeenvironment cannot be overstated, and recent ad-vances in laboratory techniques and gene sequenc-ing technology have made it easier to isolate,identify, and quantify the specic organisms presentin the horse's hindgut. The newest frontier inequine nutrition research involves delving into theequine microbiome, and scientists are currentlyworking to characterize what both a healthy andunhealthy equine microbiome looks like, in additionto how that microbial ecosystem can be manipulatedto improve horse health and performance. 10,11 Concentrates The demands of exercise and performance increasedigestible energy and nutrient requirements ofthe horse. When forage alone cannot meet theseincreased demands, a concentrate feed will be re-quired to meet the nutritional needs of the perfor-mance horse. Concentrates include cereal grainslike corn, oats, and barley, as well as commerciallyavailable pelleted and textured grain mixes. Whenappraising the impact of concentrates on digestivehealth, meal size, and composition are importantfactors to consider, especially in relation to prevent-ing starch overload in the hindgut. The horse'ssmall intestine is well suited to digest starch, auseful energy source for many performance horses,up to a certain point. Many studies have at-tempted to elucidate the upper limit of small intes-tinal starch digestion to prevent starch fromreaching the hindgut. Small intestinal starch di-gestion varies somewhat with cereal grain source(i.e., oat starch is more digestible than barley starch)and processing (i.e., mechanical and hydrothermal),but a general guideline is to limit starch intake,regardless of the source, to /H110212 g/kg BW/meal in order to prevent starch overload and rapid fermen-tation in the hindgut. 12,13Practically, this trans- lates into feeding no more than a 2.5 kg meal of acereal grain-based concentrate (40% starch) for a500-kg horse (or, limiting meal size to 0.5% of thehorse's BW). Limiting the starch content of a mealeven further may be warranted in certain circum-stances (i.e,. in horses with insulin dysregulation orgastric ulcers), but this is a good benchmark goal formost healthy performance horses. For horses thatare prone to bolting or rushing their concentratemeals, feeding hay before the concentrate meal canalso help to slow the rate of intake. 14 Concentrate composition will also dictate the total amount of starch contained in a meal. Concentratemeals consisting of straight cereal grains will con-tain the highest concentration of starch, whilemulti-ingredient rations and commercially availableproducts will vary considerably depending on theproportion of ingredients in the ration or feed for-mulation. Book values for cereal grains are readilyavailable, and if the starch level of a commerciallyavailable horse feed product is not listed on the feedtag, the manufacturer should be able to providethat information upon request. Many commer-cially available products for performance horses con-tain added fat and ber, which are used asadditional sources of digestible energy. This is gen-erally positive in terms of digestive health, as itreduces reliance on starch to serve as the primaryenergy source, as well as supplies additional digest-ible ber. For horses with elevated energy require-ments, feeding fat- and ber-added rations increasesthe energy density of the diet and in most cases is arecommended practice. However, there is an upperthreshold for small intestinal fat digestion that, ifexceeded, can reduce the digestibility of certain nu-trients. The inclusion of fat at up to at least 10% oftotal dry matter intake (forage /H11001concentrate) ap- pears to have minimal negative impact on digestivehealth. 15Because forages are naturally low in fat (1% to 3% DM basis), exceeding this level of fat inthe total ration is not common, even with the use ofhigh-fat concentrate feeds ( /H1102210% to 14% fat). 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: FEEDING FOR FITNESSFeed Additives and Supplements There is an overwhelming array of \"digestive aid\" supplements and feed additives for horses availableon the market, and their use is especially popular inperformance horse rations. While some may play arole in promoting digestive health, there is no sub-stitute for proper feed selection and implementationof appropriate feeding practices. Without those inplace, no supplement or additive can have any sig-nicant impact on overall digestive health. While afull review of additives and supplements is notwithin the scope of this discussion, there are a fewpoints to consider related to their selection and use.Some of the more common additives that have beenstudied in relation to their impact on digestivehealth include probiotics (live strains of microorgan-isms), prebiotics (substrates for microbial fermenta-tion), and yeast cultures and yeast derivatives.When evaluating the efcacy of these additives, itcannot be assumed that results obtained in studiesconducted in human or other lab animal species willapply to the horse. Look for published data thatconrm safety and efcacy in the species of interest(the horse) that show a clear justication for recom-mended dosage. Rather than relying on an addi-tive or supplement to promote digestive health,consider them as adjunct support for an overall feed-ing program that follows the principles outlinedabove related to forage and concentrate feeding andmanagement practices. Feed Transitions Changes in the amount or type of feed offered to ahorse should be implemented gradually, to allow thedigestive system to adapt and to prevent digestivedisturbances. Large increases or decreases in totalvolume of feed offered should occur gradually aswell. This applies to fresh pasture, preserved for-ages (i.e., hay), and concentrate feeds. It is recom-mended that horses not acclimated to grazing beintroduced to lush pasture over a period of severaldays. 5When transitioning from one type of hay to a different type of hay, and even from one batch ofhay to a new batch of the same hay variety, it is goodpractice to combine the old and new hay for a min-imum of several days and for up to 2 weeks as thetransition is made. When making the switchfrom one concentrate feed to another, a good gen-eral rule of thumb is to make the change at a rateof no more than approximately 0.5 kg per day.This conservative approach to feed transitions willfurther promote digestive health, especially inperformance horses with a history of digestiveupset. 3. Feeding Recommendations for Certain Gastrointestinal Conditions Gastric Ulcers It is well documented that performance horses are at a high risk for the development of gastric ulcers,specically equine squamous gastric disease(ESGD). Little evidence exists for the role of diet inequine glandular gastric disease. 16In addition to following the principles of feeding management out-lined above, there are some special considerationsfor horses being treated for or with a history ofESGD. Without alterations in the feeding andmanagement of these horses, it is likely that squa-mous ulcers will return once treatment is complete.When managing horses with ESGD, additional feed-ing recommendations are to provide as much turn-out on pasture as possible, allow free choice access oroffer hay frequently (4-6 meals/day), limit starchcontent of concentrate meals avoid orally administered hypertonic electrolyte so-lutions. 16Feeding smaller, more frequent meals and incorporating alfalfa hay into the forage compo-nent of the ration are also recommended to lessenthe severity and prevent the recurrence of gastriculcers. 17The inclusion of alfalfa hay in the diet, preferably provided at regular 5- to 6-hour intervals,is recommended as it has been shown to buffer gas-tric contents and decrease gastric ulcer severity. 18 Gastric protectant and buffering supplements thathave published data behind them may also have arole in maintaining proper gastric pH and promot-ing a healthy gastric environment, and these includea pectin-lecithin complex and a natural-source min-eral complex rich in seaweed-derived calcium. 19,20 Chronic Colic A wide variety of conditions may result in frequentbouts of colic, and the horse should be screened forsuch conditions and treated appropriately. Long-term feeding management recommendations forthese horses are based on following the feeding andmanagement practices outlined above, as well asminimizing common colic risk factors (Table 1).Stabled horses with reduced access to grazing are 3times more likely to suffer from colic, and pastureaccess should be maximized when possible. 21Only highly digestible feeds should be utilized, and small,frequent meals should be offered throughout theday. In addition to grass pasture, good forage op-tions include high-quality grass hay, alfalfa hay orgrass-alfalfa mix hay, soaked alfalfa cubes, and beetpulp. Having hay tested at a forage testing lab a will ensure that the forage is of acceptable quality,as consumption of overly mature hay can easily leadto colic in sensitive horses. A general guideline isthe higher the relative feed value, the less matureand the better the hay quality. In horses with ahistory of chronic colic, aim for feeding hay with arelative feed value of /H1102286. Alfalfa hay should be avoided in horses with a history of or increased riskof enteroliths, as the higher protein and mineralcontent increases colonic pH which has been impli-cated to be predisposing factor for enterolith for-mation. 22,23Finally, supplementing 1-2 Tbsp per day of plain white salt or a commercial electrolytesupplement may encourage water intake, especially AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 63HOW-TO SESSION: FEEDING FOR FITNESSin the colder months when some horses drink signif- icantly less water. Inflammation of the Intestinal Tract and Hindgut Dysfunction Many medical conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease, chronic diarrhea, right dorsal coli-tis, and colonic ulcers, feature some level of in-flammation of the intestinal tract and hindgutdysfunction, and the recommended dietary strat-egies to address symptoms in horses with diag-nosed or suspected inflammatory bowel conditionsor other related disturbances of the hindgut aresimilar. The basic feeding objectives when ad-dressing bowel inflammation and hindgut dys-function are 1) reduce the mechanical andphysiologic demand on the colon, and 2) promotemucosal healing. A reduction in mechanical loadcan best be accomplished by reducing or eliminat-ing long-stemmed forage from the ration for aperiod of 3 to 8 months, with the length of time being dictated by the response of the horse. Elim-inating long-stemmed forage and feeding a low bulkration will substantially reduce total dry matter in-take and reduce ingesta particle size, helping toalleviate mucosal trauma. Select a high-qualitypelleted complete feed with built-in forage fortiedwith vitamins, minerals, and additional amino acids(commercially available senior horse feeds workwell) in order to provide an easily digestible rationthat meets all the horse's nutrient requirements.Dividing the daily ration into small, frequent meals(4 to 6 per day) will promote consistent intake andencourage normal gastrointestinal motility. Insome cases, a small amount of high-quality foragemay be included in the ration, but only if the horsecan tolerate it. Alfalfa hay should be used withcaution in horses with chronic diarrhea, as alfalfa isknown to have a laxative effect in some horses.Forage selection recommendations for chronic colicalso apply to horses with bowel inflammation. Thehorse can also be allowed to graze small amounts offresh grass (10- to 15-minute intervals, 4 to 6 timesdaily). Intermittent psyllium mucilloid supple-mentation is recognized as a management tool toreduce sand accumulation in the horse's digestivetract, but daily supplementation has been suggested to further promote ingesta passage and reduce mu-cosal trauma. Studies in other species have shownthat the endogenous production of the short-chainfatty acid, butyrate (a product of the microbial fer-mentation of psyllium), may aid in mucosal healing,therefore psyllium supplemen tation warrants con- sideration in the treatment of equine gastrointes-tinal disease. 3Although controlled studies are lacking, some reports have identied recommended daily feeding rates for psyllium to be 1) 100 gramsper day, and 2) 5 tablespoons every 12 to 24 hours,to promote mucosal healing and repair in colitiscases. 27,28The implementation of a low-bulk ra- tion can sometimes be met with owner resistance,but discussing the rationale behind this approachand explaining the temporary nature of the feedingplan can help to increase owner compliance andoverall success. Long-stemmed forage can be grad-ually reintroduced to the ration once symptoms haveimproved, to identify how much and what type offorage the horse can best tolerate on a long-termbasis. It is important to continually monitor thesehorses closely, as they seem to be more sensitive todietary and management changes. 4. Conclusion Following basic nutrition principles that promote op-timal digestive health when feeding performancehorses will serve to support athletic performance andprevent digestive disturbances. When an equine ath- lete is not meeting performance expectations and/orexperiences symptoms related to poor digestive health,the evaluation of feeding and management practices,and making appropriate adjustments, will supportany necessary medical treatment and improve overalloutcome.

Introduction In combination with exercise, nutrition is an essen- tial component of managing horses with m yopa- thies. The optimal feeding program for an individual is tailored to the diagnosis of a specic underlyingmyopathy. 2. Classication impaired after exercise.Exertional rhabdomyolysis (ER) (PSSM1), PSSM2 and MFM in Warmbloods, that are not typ-ically characterized by elevations in serum CKand AST activities. 6Horses with these exertional myopathies have exercise intolerance and show re-luctance to go forward, collect, and engage the hind-quarters. Because these clinical signs are notspecic to muscle disease, causes of decreased per- formance such as behavior, rider, tack, and orthope-dic lameness need to be ruled out p rior to in- vestigating a primary exertional myopathy. Exertional Rhabdomyolysis Overt ER can arise as a sporadic event due toextrinsic factors such as exercise in excess oftraining, nutritional imbalances, or exercise dur-ing viral illness. ER can also occur as a chronicdisease due to intrinsic abnormalities in musclefunction. Acute clinical signs of ER are similaracross the spectrum of etiologies and include mus-cle stiffness, shortened hindlimb stride, reluc-tance to move, and rm, painful hindquartermuscles. Anxiety, pain, sweating, and increasedrespiratory rate are common signs. Sporadic ER Sporadic forms of ER develop from exercise in excessof training, dietary imbalances (including highnonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) content and lowforage content), and deciencies in electrolytes. 7,8 ER may be exacerbated by inadequate dietary sele-nium and vitamin E. 66 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: FEEDING FOR FITNESS NOTESChronic ER Chronic forms of ER appear to develop in horses due to intrinsic abnormalities in muscle function. Insome cases, muscle dysfunction is attributed to asingle gene defect. 9,10In other cases, there may be multiple genes impacting muscle dysfunction orpost-translational modications of gene productsthat arise under certain environmental stimuli. Recurrent Exertional Rhabdomyolysis Recurrent exertional rhabdomyolysis describes asubset of ER that is believed to be due to an abnor-mality in the regulation of muscle contraction andrelaxation. 11-13Research into RER has primarily been performed in Thoroughbreds and to a lesserextent in Standardbreds. 11,14-16There are reports of ER in racing Quarter Horses, Arabians, andWarmbloods that may have the same underlyingcause based on the overlapping histories, clinicalsigns, muscle biopsy ndings, and response to man-agement. 17Mares more commonly have RER than males, although no general correlation has been ob-served between episodes of ER and stages of the estrous cycle. 18Nervous horses, particularly ner- vous llies, have a higher incidence of ER than calm horses.14,19,20Diet also has an impact with Thor- oughbreds fed more than 2.5 kg of grain beingmore likely to show signs. 21Research suggests that horses with RER may have an inherent abnor-mality in intramuscular calcium regulation that isintermittently manifested during exercise in stress-ful environments. 13,22 Polysaccharide Storage Myopathy Several acronyms (PSSM), including EPSM andEPSSM. 23-25Muscle biopsies from characterized by the presence of abnor-mal polysaccharide inclusions, which results in synthase activity and higher muscle in skeletal muscle. 10The enzyme mutation enhances synthe- sis of glycogen and appears to disrupt metabolism ofthis energy substrate. The severity of clinical signsof PSSM1 can vary widely from asymptomatic to severe incapacitation. The most common triggerfor ER is less than 20 minutes of light exercise,particularly if the horse has been rested for severaldays prior to exercise or is unt. Diets high in NSCalso increase the risk of muscle pain and stiffness inPSSM1 horses. 26The gold standard for diagnosis of PSSM1 is genetic testing for the GYS1 mutation performed on whole blood or hair root samples.PSSM2 PSSM2 is a histopathologic designation abnormal-appearing amylase-sensitive of muta- the term PSSM2 does not etiology since no common geneticmutations or biochemical aberrations have been de-ned in these horses to date. Commercial genetictests for PSSM2 have not been scientically vali-dated through peer-reviewed Approx-imately 28% of breeds would beclassied as PSSM2. 27Quarter Horses with ER have biochemical elevations inmuscle glycogen concentrations. PSSM2 seems tobe common in both high-performance Quarter Horsetypes such as barrel racing, reining, and cuttinghorses as well as pleasure and halter horses. About80% of Warmblood horses in of exercise intolerance rather than presenting with exercise intolerance orintermittent ER that is dened by specic histopa-thology. 5,6The hallmark the cytoskeletalprotein desmin in scattered bers. Desminfunctions to align sarcomeres at the Z-disc andtether them to the cell membrane. MFM mayrepresent a more extreme subset of PSSM2 inWarmbloods and but further research isrequired. Mean muscle glycogen concentrations inWarmblood and Arabian horses with are sim-ilar to controls. 28,29 MFM in Warmbloods Warmblood horses diagnosed with MFM by musclebiopsy have an insidious onset of exercise intoler-ance notable by 6-8 years of age characterizedby a lack of stamina, unwillingness to go forward,inability to collect, abnormal canter transitions, andinability to sustain a normal canter. 6Unresolved hindlimb lameness, stiffness, muscle pain and,rarely, an episode of ER are reported. 29Serum CK and AST activities are usually within normal limitsunless samples are taken in conjunction with ER.A recent study found no association between com-mercial genetic tests for MFM and a clinical andhistopathologic diagnosis of MFM in Warmbloodhorses. 30The basis for MFM in Warmblood horses appears to be related to the individual effects of diet, exercise, and training on gene and protein responses toexercise with downstream effects on muscle mass, thealignment of contractile proteins, mitochondrial func-tion, and 67HOW-TO SESSION: FEEDING FOR FITNESSMFM in Arabians Arabian endurance horses diagnosed with MFM usually have a history of intermittent elevations inserum CK activity after endurance rides (/H1102210,000U/L) or during exercise that follows a week or moreof rest. 5Horses do not always show the same de- gree of pain, sweating, and reluctance to move, as isfrequently seen in other forms of acute ER. Myo-globinuria can be observed in horses with only mildmuscle stiffness. Between episodes, the heart rate,lactate, CK, and AST responses to exercise are nor-mal. The basis for MFM in Arabian horses appearsto be related to a need for enhanced cysteine synthe-sis, decreased cysteine-based antioxidants, and oxi-dative stress. 31 3. Management of Chronic Exertional Muscle Disorders Altering diet and exercise regimes to compensate for underlying defects is often the best availablestrategy to assist horses with exertional myopa-thies. Identifying and eliminating any knownfactors that trigger ER are also important in pre-venting further episodes. Controlled treatmenttrials have been performed to validate management strategies for RER and PSSM1. 26,32,33Less evi- denced-based information is available with regard to management of PSSM2 and MFM, and recommenda-tions are based largely on retrospective studies or clinical impressions. 17,34 4. Feeding Programs for Horses with Myopathies A nutritionally balanced diet with appropriate ca-loric intake and adequate protein, vitamins, andminerals is a core element in treating all formsof exertional myopathies. As with all classes ofhorses, the development of a ration for these horsesincludes a series of steps. 1.Determine daily nutrient requirements.A horse's nutrient requirements depend onage, breed, body size, growth rate, level ofexercise, and other considerations. The Na- tional Research Council last published its rec-ommendations for horses in 2007. 35National Research Council requirements are often con-sidered minimums for many nutrients. Rec-ommendations that are more commonly used inpractice are also available in commerciallyavailable software a,b. 2.Select type and intake of forage. Forage should be the foundation of every equine feed-ing program, so it is important to establishboth the type and expected intake of foragebefore choosing concentrates or supplements. 3.Select energy sources in concentrate.One of the keys to managing exertional myop-athies is controlling the source of energy in aration. Energy requirements in the US areexpressed in terms of megacalories (Mcal) ofdigestible energy (NSCs),fat, structural carbohydrates (ber), sum of water-soluble carbo-hydrates (WSCs) (sugars) and starch. Mostconcentrates fed to ER horses are low in NSCand high in fat. Unfortunately, determiningthe NSC content of commercial concentratesis not easy since these nutrients rarely appearas guarantees on feed tags or bags. Althoughthe American Association of Feed ControlOfcials currently suggests that commercialfeed products that bear labeling claims re-lated to carbohydrate content should includemax sugar (ESC) and max starch in the guar-anteed analysis, there is not an agreed-uponmethod for measuring ESC and starch. There-fore, many state regulatory agencies do not al-low these nutrients to appear with othernutrient analyses such as protein, fat, orcrude ber. Feed manufacturers often sup-ply this information in supporting literatureor on the internet, but these gures are notregulated by any governmental agency. Mostfeed manufacturers use Equi-Analytical inIthaca, NY cto determine WSC and starch val- ues in feeds, and horse owners and veterinar-ians can also send feeds and forages to this labfor analysis. 4.Calculate intake of concentrate to meetenergy requirement. The quantity of con- centrate required by a horse equals the DErequirement of the horse minus the DEsupplied by forage. The DE requirement isdependent upon the activity level and the cur-rent energy status of the horse. DE require-ments will vary depending on whether thehorse needs to lose, gain, or maintain its bodyweight. 5.Calculate intake of other nutrients (pro-tein, minerals, vitamins) provided fromforage and concentrate. Most commercial concentrates are formulated to meet nearly allof the protein, mineral, and vitamin require-ments of the horse if fed at a typical level ofintake as recommended on the feed bag. Of-ten, a horse will be fed below this expectedrange of intake and additional forticationwill be required. This is particularly truewhen horses are fed high-quality forage or ifthey need to lose weight. 6.Supplement-required nutrients not pro-vided by forage and concentrate. Sup- plements are often necessary to providenutrients not found in the forage and concen-trate, either because of low concentrate in-takes or to supply levels of nutrients that aregreater than typically added to commercialfeeds. Electrolytes, amino acids, vitamin E,and other antioxidants fall into this categoryfor horses suffering from myopathies. 68 SESSION: FEEDING FOR FITNESS5. Exertional Rhabdomyolysis A general approach to designing a ration for horses with primary clinical signs of ER is outlined inFig. 1. 6. Sporadic ER Nutrient Requirements Total nutrient requirements will vary depending on the horse's size, breed, discipline, and level of activ-ity. DE requirements will vary from near mainte-nance to twice maintenance. Forage Since low forage intake may contribute to sporadicbouts of ER, provide adequate quantities of high-quality forage. Performance horses will typicallyconsume 1.5%-2% of body weight per day of hay.Good-quality grass or grass-legume mixed hays(55%-65% neutral detergent ber [NDG], 10%-12%crude protein [CP], 10%-17% NSC) are preferable. Energy Sources A concentrate with moderate levels of soluble carbo-hydrate (20%-30% NSC), fat (4%-8%), and ber(20%-30% NDF) is appropriate. Horses with spo-radic ER do not necessarily benet from increaseddietary fat, so addition of fat should depend uponcaloric needs.Concentrate Intake Concentrate intake will depend on the horse's DErequirement, and the quality and quantity of forage.If low concentrate (/H110213 kg/d) is required, supplemen-tal protein, minerals, and vitamins may be required.This is best accomplished with appropriately forti-ed ration balancer pellets. Underweight horsesmay benet from additional vegetable oil (120-240mL) or stabilized rice bran (0.5-1 kg). Supplements Electrolyte imbalances and deciencies are a com-mon cause of sporadic ER. Horses should havefree-choice access to a salt block and be supple-mented with salt or a commercial electrolyte at lev-els to meet requirements. This can vary from 30 to60 g/day with light sweating and up to 120-150g/day with heavy sweating. Furosemide adminis-tration (5 cc) results in around 20 g of sodium and35 g chloride loss in urine in the rst 4 hours afteradministration. 36 Selenium and vitamin E status should be evalu- ated. Low serum levels of either nutrient warrantsupplementation. For horses with a neuromuscu-lar disease, serum vitamin E levels should bechecked periodically to ensure levels are /H110223 /H9262g/mL and supplemental vitamin E dosages adjusted ac-cordingly. Large individual variation has beenfound in serum alpha tocopherol concentrations Fig. 1. An approach to managing horses with clinical signs of ER characterized by muscle stiffness, sweating, reluctance to move, and increased serum CK activity. Decisions should be based on the underlying myopathy, the horse's caloric needs, and current bodyweight.*These are suggested recommendations based on current research in normal horses and anecdotal reports from the eld and have notyet been tested on horses with this myopathy. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 with 2000-5000 IU/ day of vitamin E.37Natural-source vitamin E is more bioavailable than synthetic sources, and eithermicellized dor nanodispersedesources rapidly re- store serum status.37,38 7. RER Nutrient Requirements As with sporadic ER, RER nutrient requirements will vary depending on the horse's size, breed, dis-cipline, and level of activity. DE requirements willvary from near maintenance to twice maintenance.RER occurs most frequently in Thoroughbred andStandardbred racehorses that have DE require-ments of 30-35 Mcal DE/day. Forage Thoroughbred horses do not appear to show thesame signicant increase in serum insulin concen-trations in response to consuming hay with an NSCof 17% as seen in Quarter Horses. 39This fact com- bined with the high caloric requirements of race-horses suggests that it is not as important to selecthay with very low NSC content in RER Thorough-breds as it is in PSSM horses. Anecdotally, sometrainers nd horses with RER have more frequentepisodes of ER on alfalfa hay, in which case it shouldbe avoided on an individual basis. The nervousdisposition of some RER horses may predisposethem to gastric ulcers, and thus frequent provisionof hay with a moderate NSC and mixed alfalfa con-tent may be indicated. Energy Sources Substitution of fat for NSC in an energy-denseration signicantly reduces muscle damage in exer-cising RER horses. A controlled trial using a spe-cialized feed fdeveloped for RER showed that NSC should provide no greater than 20% and fat shouldprovide between 20% and 25% of daily DE intake foroptimal 32The benet of a high-fat for RER does not appear to be a changein muscle metabolism. Pre- and post-exercise mus-cle glycogen and lactate concentrations are the samein RER fed a low-starch, high-fat diet com-pared with a high-starch diet. 32,40Rather, low- NSC, high-fat diets in RER horses may decreasemuscle damage by assuaging anxiety and excitabil-ity, which are tightly linked to developing rhabdo-myolysis in susceptible horses. High-fat, low-NSCdiets fed to t RER horses produce lower glucose,insulin, and cortisol responses and led to a calmerdemeanor and lower pre-exercise heart rates. 41 Neurohormonal changes may develop in response tohigh serum glucose, insulin, and cortisol concentra- tions, resulting in an anxious demeanor. Concentrates Racehorses in full training typically consume 6-7kg/day of concentrate. Racehorse concentrates forRER horses should contain 12%-18% NSC and10%-13% fat. To maintain high energy densities(3.2-3.4 Mcal DE/kg), they should also containsources of highly digestible ber such as beet pulp orsoy hulls. The benecial effects of low-NSC, high-fat rations appear to be more directly related to theglycemic and insulinemic nature of the feeds ratherthan their absolute NSC and fat content. Therefore, the ingredients used in a concentrate also affect itssuitably as an RER feed. WSCs produce higher gly-cemic responses than starch. Molasses is extremelyglycemic in horses, 42but added fat greatly reduces glycemic response, even in high-NSC feeds.43,44Gly- cemic response is also affected by rate of intake andrate of gastric emptying. 44,45 While a calm demeanor is desired during training, some racehorse trainers feeding low-NSC, high-fatfeeds prefer to supplement with a titrated amount ofgrain three days prior to a race to potentially boostliver glycogen and increase a horse's energy duringthe race. As with sporadic ER, concentrate intakes /H110213 kg/ day may not provide adequate amounts of protein,minerals, or vitamins and a balancer pellet may berequired. Studies in RER horses show that signicant re- ductions or normalization of post-exercise serum CKactivity occurs within a week of commencing a low-starch, high-fat diet. 32Days of no training and standing in a stall are discouraged because post-exercise CK activity is higher after 2 days of restcompared with values taken when performing con-secutive days of the same amount of submaximalexercise. 32 8. PSSM1 Nutrient Requirements Meeting the horse's caloric requirements for an ideal body weight is the most important consideration indesigning a ration for PSSM, as many horses withPSSM are easy keepers and may be overweight atthe time of diagnosis. Adding excessive calories inthe form of fat to the diet of an obese horse mayproduce metabolic syndrome and is contraindicated.If necessary, caloric intake should be reduced byusing a grazing muzzle during turnout, feeding haywith a much lower NSC content at 1%-1.5% of bodyweight, providing a low-calorie ration balancer, andgradually introducing daily exercise. Rather thanprovide dietary fat to an overweight horse, fastingfor 6 hours before exercise can be used to elevateplasma free fatty acids prior to exercise and allevi-ate any restrictions in energy metabolism in muscle. Forage Quarter Horses develop a signicant increase in se-rum insulin concentrations in response to consum- ing hay with an NSC of 17%, whereas insulinconcentrations are fairly stable when fed hay with12% or 4% NSC content. 33Because insulin stimu- of PSSM1 horses, selecting haywith 12% or less NSC is advisable. The degree towhich the NSC content of hay should be restrictedbelow 12% NSC depends on the caloric low-NSC ( /H110215%), NDF) hay provides room to add an adequateamount of fat to the diet of easy keepers withoutexceeding the daily caloric requirement and induc-ing excessive weight gain. For example, a 500-kglightly exercised horse generally requires 18 McalDE/day. A mixed-grass hay NSC, 55% kg/day meets the horse'sdaily caloric requirement. In contrast, 8 kg of a 4%NSC hay (1.7 Mcal DE/kg) would provide 13.6 McalDE/day, which would allow a reasonable addition of4.4 Mcal DE from fat per day (530 mL of vegetableoil). Energy Sources A high-NSC diet increases the propensity to developmuscle pain with aerobic exercise in PSSM1horses. 26A high-NSC diet results in enhanced gly- cogen synthase which may impair oxidativemetabolism of suppression of lipolysis by high in-sulin. 26Low dietary starch and fat supplementa-tion facilitate muscle fat metabolism in PSSM1 horses. Concentrates Concentrates for PSSM1 horses should be low in NSC (/H1102115%) and low glycemic. High fat (10%-12%) can be included in the concentrate but, if dailyintake is low (/H110212 kg/d), then additional fat supple-mentation may be required from added vegetable oil(120-240 mL) or stabilized rice bran. Hydrated,rinsed beet pulp produces a very low glycemicresponse and can be used as a carrier for addedvegetable oil. 42One kilogram of beet pulp (pre- hydrated weight) and 1 cup (240 mL) of vegetable oiland 500 g of a balancer pellet (to meet protein,mineral, and vitamin requirements) would providearound 6.0 Mcal DE, which is equivalent to the DEsupplied by 2 kg of a typical commercial concentrate. Exertional Myopathies A current approach to managing horses with exer-tional myopathies that are characterized by exerciseintolerance and normal serum CK activity is out-lined in Fig. 2. This approach is based on muscle biopsy diagnosis of PSSM2 or MFM and not basedon a diagnosis using commercial genetic tests forPSSM2 or MFM that have not been scienticallyvalidated through peer-reviewed publication. 30 Fig. 2. An approach to managing horses with clinical signs of exertional myopathy characterized by exercise intolerance and normal to mildly increased serum CK activity. To conclude that a myopathy is responsible for exercise intolerance, other common causesshould rst be ruled out.*These are suggested recommendations based on current research in normal horses and anecdotal reports from the eld and have notyet been fully tested on horses with this myopathy. AAEP /H11408Vol. mentioned above, PSSM2 appears represent a histologic description of glycogen staining in musclebiopsy rather than one specic disease. 29With a lack of information on the cause of PSSM2, the low-NSC, high-fat PSSM1 diet has been universally rec-ommended for all horses diagnosed with PSSMregardless of whether PSSM1 or PSSM2. 46Recom- mendations for feeding PSSM2, however, have nowevolved according to breed based on recent researchinto muscle glycogen concentrations, histologic mark-ers, and molecular approaches that better subclassifyPSSM2. Biochemical analysis of muscle biopsies indicates that Quarter Horses with PSSM2 have muscle gly-cogen concentrations that are as high as PSSM1 andthat lack abnormal desmin staining characteristicof MFM (unpublished observation). Thus, thePSSM1 diet remains the appropriate recommendeddiet for Quarter Horses with PSSM2. An unpub-lished survey of horse owners indicates that epi-sodes of ER signicantly decrease with this dietaryapproach (personal observation). Biochemical analysis of muscle biopsies in Arabi- ans and Warmblood horses with PSSM2 has foundthat glycogen concentrations are similar to those ofhealthy, breed-matched controls. 28,29Thus, the ra- tionale for a low-NSC these breeds appearslacking. Additionally, a subset of PSSM2 horseshas been found to have a histologic marker (desminaggregation) indicative of MFM, a muscle disordercharacterized by weakness, atrophy, and myobril-lar disarray. on this new nding and scriptomic and proteomic analyses of muscle fromhorses with MFM, a new dietary approach has beendeveloped for MFM horses. 31 This new diet is informed by indictors that aber- rations in cysteine-based antioxidants, oxidativestress, respiratory chain arekey MFM. 31An unanswered question is whether desmin aggregation is a late stage ofPSSM2 in Arabians below. It seems sensible to assume that ifPSSM2 horses have not responded satisfactorily to alow-NSC, high-fat diet, a trial period of 6-8 weekson the MFM diet would be warranted (Fig. 2). Notethat these recommendations are developed based ona muscle biopsy diagnosis of MFM, which does notappear to correspond with MFM diagnosis by com-mercial genetic tests. 30 Because the caloric/nutrition needs and symptom- ology differ between MFM endurance Arabians ca-pable of performing hours of aerobic exercise andMFM Warmbloods incapable of satisfactorily per-forming for 45 minutes, dietary approaches differ. Nutrient Requirements MFM involves muscle sarcomere breakdown and at-rophy, so rations should focus on providing qualityprotein and specic amino acids to aid in sarcomereregenesis. Additionally, since oxidative stress islikely involved in the degenerative process, antioxi-dants or precursors of antioxidants are important tosupport the mitochondrial respiratory chain, themajor source of reactive oxygen species in exercisingmuscle. Forage MFM horses will typically consume 1.5%-2% of bodyweight per day of hay. Good-quality grass or grass-legume mixed hays (55%-65% NDF, 10%-12% CP,10%-17% NSC) are preferable. Energy Sources In the US the trend for feeding Warmbloods hasbeen toward low- NSC, high-fat diets. This is not the case in Europe. Elite European sport horses consume feeds that are higher in NSC (25%-35%)and more moderate in fat (4%-6%). 47There is no evidence extremely by Warmbloods with MFM. In not appear to be a scientic reason whyadditional fat, a potential source of oxidative stress, would be of benet to Warmbloods with MFM.Arabian endurance horses are typically fed higher fat diets, as Arabians depend more on fat oxidationthan Thoroughbreds during exercise. 48However, since MFM in Arabian endurance horses is relatedto oxidative stress resulting from fat oxidation, it is questionable whether these horses need extremelyhigh levels of fat intake ( /H1102215% total DE intake). Concentrates Both Warmbloods and Arabian endurance horses inthe US are typically fed fairly low levels of concen-trate. In a survey of US endurance riders, concen-trate intake averaged 2.27 kg/day. 49The riders preferred lower protein concentrates (10% CP) andoverall protein content of the diet averaged 10.2%,ranging from 6.2% to 15.7%. Endurance riders feedlow-protein rations because they are concerned thathigh-protein diets may increase body heat, urineproduction, and water needs. While this level ofprotein intake may meet crude protein requirementsin normal horses, it may be decient in specicamino acids such as lysine, methionine, and threo-nine needed for muscle repair and generation of cysteine-based antioxidants. Leucine stimulatesprotein synthesis in the muscle post-exercise, 50 which would be benecial to MFM horses. There-fore, concentrates for MFM horses should includehigher levels of protein (12%-14% CP) containinghigh-quality amino acids and moderate levels ofNSC (20%-30%) and fat (4%-8%). Supplements Amino acids For horses with symmetrical topline muscle atrophy and horses with MFM, amino acid supplements are 72 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: FEEDING FOR FITNESScurrently recommended.6,51Whey-based proteins are recommended because they are rich in cysteine. Cysteine is a key component of many antioxidants,and Arabian horses with MFM appear to have anincreased cysteine requirement following exercise. 31 Antioxidants Horses with MFM have decreased expression of mi- and antioxidants in their mus-cle. 31Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a key component of the rst step in the mitochondrial electron trans-port chain. Arabian and Warmblood horses withMFM have decreased expression of proteins in-volved in this rst step. When fed with aminoacids, CoQ10 gincreases mitochondrial proteins when fed to healthy horses (Valberg unpublished).CoQ10 is used in human muscle disorders and isnow being trialed as a supplement for MFM horses.

Exercise is widely recognized as a stressor, causing neuroendocrine and hormonal changes that impactimmune response. 1While moderate intensity exer- cise performed regularly can benet host defensemechanisms, acute bouts of high-intensity exerciseor prolonged strenuous activity can result in immu-nosuppression, primarily of the innate immune sys-tem. 2Not surprisingly, exercise training has been associated with increased susceptibility to viral in-fection. 3Heavily campaigned performance horses are also confronted with environmental stressors(e.g., frequent transport over long distances, concen-trated stabling at show and racetrack facilities) thatfurther elevate exposure to airborne pathogens and increase disease risk. 4 Nutrition plays a supportive role in immunity and host defense.5,6Various amino acids (e.g., glu- tamine, are critical to theformation, proliferation, and functional activity ofimmune cells and other components of the immunesystem. Vitamins A, D, E, and C are also impor-tant to immune cell function, as well as mitigation ofreactive oxygen species generated by highly meta-bolic immune cells participating in host defense.Polyunsaturated fatty acids, acting via their conver-sion to eicosanoids, are responsible for directing many activities associated with inflammation and immuneresponse. Even dietary ber, a heterogenous group ofoligo- and polysaccharides, supports and directs im-mune cell activities locally within the gastrointestinaltract and systemically. Deciencies or imbalances ofthese nutrients generally result in compromised im-mune function and decreased disease resistance.Therefore, a balanced diet is critical to maintain im-muno-surveillance and to mount an appropriate im-mune response to infection or trauma. Additionally,some nutrients possess immuno-stimulatory or modu-latory effects when supplemented to the diet aboveestablished requirements. Can the horse's immune system be improved through his feed bucket? Possibly. The eld ofnutritional immunology, where interactions be-tween diet and immune function are investigated, isa relatively young science, with concentrated re- search efforts occurring mostly in the last 30 years.Comparatively, the application of immuno-nutritionto the feeding of horses is only in its infancy. Whilewe are not yet in a position to provide proscriptivediets that will enhance immunity of disease-susceptible horses, there is some evidence for spe-cic nutrients that may someday prove useful forimproving host defense. This paper highlights re- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 75HOW-TO SESSION: FEEDING FOR FITNESS NOTESsearch on nutrients that have been fed to the horse with the specic intent to modulate immune func-tion, including the need to meet key vitamin andmineral requirements, the use of omega-3 fatty acidsto modulate inflammation, and prebiotics and otherfunctional bers to maintain gut health. 2. Meet the Horse's Vitamin and Mineral Requirements Several vitamins and minerals support the immune system, either through their role as antioxidants(e.g., vitamins E and C and Se) or by contributing tothe body's natural defenses by strengthening epithe-lial barriers, cell-mediated immunity, and/or anti-body production (e.g., vitamins D, E, C and A, and Seand zinc). 6Diets decient in these micronutrients result in impaired immune function and increasedsusceptibility to infection, which in some cases hasbeen used as a metric for determining daily require-ments. 7Therefore, ensuring that the horse's diet contains adequate levels of vitamins and minerals iskey to maintaining host defense. Research in hu- mans and animals has shown that some micronutri-ents also have immuno-modulatory effects whensupplemented above requirements, 5but strong evi- dence to support this in horses is unavailable. Vitamin E works in concert with vitamin C, Se, and glutathione to protect oxidation of cell mem-brane lipids. Reactive oxygen species are gener-ated during exercise with heightened musclemetabolism and are also produced by highly meta-bolic immune cells, including superoxide radicalsand hydrogen peroxide produced by phagocytes aspart of the oxidative burst. Although the formationof reactive oxygen species can serve an essentialpurpose (e.g., killing of pathogens, attracting im-mune cells to the site of infection or trauma), theycan also damage membrane lipids, proteins, andDNA if left unchecked, which can alter cell viabilityand impair immune response. Vitamin E is the most widely studied vitamin in equine nutrition, with most research focusing on itsability to mitigate oxidative stress in exercisinghorses. Natural sources of vitamin E (RRR- /H9251-to- copherol) have shown an advantage over syntheticforms (e.g., all rac- /H9251-tocopherol acetate) for raising circulating vitamin E levels and reducing oxidativeresponse in horses in training. 8,9However, there is scant evidence that feeding vitamin E above currentrequirements (1.8 to 2 IU/kg body weight [BW] formoderate to heavy work) will improve antioxidantdefenses in otherwise-healthy horses. 7In horses with neurological disease10or myopathies,11higher rates of vitamin E supplementation are warranted.However, practitioners are cautioned against exces-sive vitamin E supplementation ( /H1102210/H11003 National Re- search Council [NRC] requirements, or 20 IU/kg BWin exercising horses), as there has been speculationthat it may interfere with the absorption of otherfat-soluble vitamins. 12Outside of its function as an antioxidant, investi- gations into the immunomodulatory role of vitamin E are limited in the horse. Most studies utilizednon-exercising populations and compared immuneresponses in horses fed vitamin E above establishedrequirements to those receiving vitamin E-decientdiets. For example, higher antibody titers to teta-nus and influenza virus vaccination were observedin horses fed 78 IU vitamin E/kg dry matter (1.5 /H11003 NRC requirement), either alone or with added Secompared with an unsupplemented diet decient inboth vitamin E (18 IU/kg dry matter) and Se (0.03mg/kg dry matter). 13Older horses supplemented with 7500 IU all-rac- /H9251-tocopherol (resulting in a to- tal vitamin E intake estimated at 7750 IU/day, 15 /H11003 NRC requirement) exhibited greater neutrophil andmonocyte bacterial-killing capacity and greater an-tibody response to an annual booster vaccinationprogram compared with those fed a vitamin E-decient diet (250 IU/day, about half the NRC re-quirement). 14Bondo and Jensen15reported higher immunoglobulin (Ig) IgG and IgM mare milk IgM in serum 4 to 5 /H11003NRC require- ments for gestating mares) compared with an un-supplemented diet that was decient in vitamin E(170 to 320 IU). The three studies discussed abovehighlight the importance of vitamin E to immunefunction in horses; however, because supplementedhorses were compared with those fed diets decientin vitamin E, they do not provide clear evidence thatvitamin E has immunomodulatory effects when fedabove requirements. More research in this area isneeded before appropriate recommendations can begiven. The trace mineral, Se, is also important to a prop- erly functioning immune system, in part because ofits role as an antioxidant. The current NRC 7re- quirement for Se in performance horses is 0.1 mg/kgdry matter intake, or 1 to 1.25 mg/day for an average500-kg horse. Several studies in horses have high-lighted detriments to both innate and acquired im-munity in horses with low (depleted) Se statusand/or when minimum Se requirements are not metby the diet. 16-19 Recent studies have also evaluated whether feed- ing Se above the current NRC requirement can fur-ther improve immune response. Brummer et al 19 performed a detailed immunological analysis on sed-entary horses receiving a Se-adequate diet (0.12mg/kg dry matter) or diets containing 3 /H11003the NRC requirement (0.3 mg/kg dry matter, with additionalSe provided as either sodium selenite or Se yeast) for29 weeks. In vivo and ex vivo responses to a novel vaccine (ovalbumin) and a vaccine horses had pre-viously been exposed to (equine influenza) were notaffected by level or source of Se intake. Lympho-cyte proliferation and gene expression of cytokinesin response to non-specic mitogen stimulation alsodid not differ between those fed Se at or above the 76 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: FEEDING FOR FITNESScurrent NRC requirements nor by dietary Se source. Oxidative and inflammatory responses were alsoevaluated in this same group of unt horses in re-sponse to a mild bout of exercise (4.4 km walk/trot). 20Although there was a transient elevation of whole blood glutathione peroxidase after exercise inhorses receiving 0.3 mg/kg dry matter as Se-yeast,measures of oxidative stress and pro-inflammatorycytokine expression were unaffected by Se source orfeeding rate. In another study, horses unaccus-tomed to exercise were subjected to a 2-hour (26-km)submaximal exercise bout after 5 weeks of Se in-takes of either 0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg dry matter (addi-tional Se was supplied as sodium selenite). 21,22 Higher Se intake resulted in increased glutathioneperoxidase activity and less lipid peroxidation fol-lowing exercise but did not alter other measures ofantioxidant status or reduce muscle damage. 21 Diets containing 0.3 mg Se/kg dry matter also re-sulted in less post-exercise leukocytosis and greaterlymphocyte viability after ex vivo exposure to hydro- gen peroxide than diets containing 0.1 mg Se/kg drymatter. 22The exercise bout was stressful enough to suppress proliferation and alter lym-phocyte mRNA cytokine expression; however, thiswas not attenuated with Se intake above the NRCrequirement. Collectively, these studies show thatfeeding Se above established requirements is notlikely to greatly enhance antioxidant status or im-prove immunocompetence when vitamin E require-ments are also concurrently being met. Vitamin C is a part of the water-soluble antiox- idant system where it traps peroxyl radicals andregenerates other antioxidants, including vitaminE. Healthy horses can synthesize vitamin C(ascorbic acid) from glucose in the liver; thus, norequirement has been established. 7It is pre- sumed endogenous synthesis of vitamin C is suf-cient to meet the needs of healthy horses;however, strenuous exercise and respiratory dis-ease, such as airway inflammation has beenshown to reduce circulating ascorbic acid concen-trations, 23,24suggesting some groups may benet from vitamin C supplementation. Despite the popularity of supplementing perfor- mance horses with vitamin C, research has not dem-onstrated a clear benet in reducing oxidativestress. 25-27Based on current research, it is dif- cult to tease out the contribution of vitamin C toantioxidant defense because it has typically beensupplemented as part of a mixture of antioxidants. Similarly, investigations on other immune-related outcomes in response to vitamin C are limited to itssupplementation as part of an antioxidant mixture.Ralston 28supplemented a small group of weanling horses with a mixture of vitamins E (800 IU) and C(5 g) or placebo beginning 5 days after the animalshad been transported over long distance (2400 miles,38 hours). Adequate responses to a routine 5-waybooster vaccination were noted in 4/5 vitamin-sup-plemented weanlings and 4/5 an-tibiotic treatment. The of vitamin-supple-mented weanlings that developed illness was notreported. Supplementation with a combination of vi-tamin E (2500 to 3000 IU), an ascorbic acid derivative(5 g), and Se (1 to 2.5 mg) did not improve neutrophilcount in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid nor lung functionin heaves-affected horses in clinical remission. 29,30 However, one of these studies30did observe greater exercise tolerance and lower scores for airway inflam-mation assessed by endoscopy in asthma-affectedhorses receiving the supplement compared with pla-cebo. Nogradi et al 31observed a reduction in bron - choalveolar lavage neutrophils and signicantimprovements in respiratory performance in a smallnumber of asthma-affected horses receiving an oralsupplement containing small quantities of docosa-hexaenoic acid (DHA; 1.5 to 3 g), vitamin C (2 to 4 g),methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), and \"mushroom com-plex.\" Differences in outcomes between these studiesmight relate to whether the horses were in remis-sion 29,30or had active airway inflammation.31Taken together, the ndings from these studies suggest thata mixture of antioxidants may be useful for modulat-ing immune responses in stressed horses; however, thespecic role of vitamin C alone on immune function inhorses remains unclear. Toxicity from excess ascor-bic acid has not been reported in horses; no side effectswere reported in horses supplemented with 20 mg/kgBW (10 g/day for a 500-kg horse) for 8 months. 32 In other species, high oral doses can reduce the body'sown synthesis of vitamin C, so abrupt cessation ofascorbic acid supplementation should be avoided. 3. Immunomodulation with Omega-3 Fatty Acids In addition to serving as a calorie source, some di-etary fats play an immunomodulatory role in thebody. More specically, fatty acids belonging to theomega-3 and omega-6 families are part of the in-flammatory cascade and exert direct effects on im-mune cells. 33,34 Similar to all mammals, horses require a dietary source of the omega-6 fatty acid, linoleic acid acid (ALA; 18:3n-3) because they lack the enzymes tosynthesize them. LA and ALA can be oxidized forenergy or incorporated into cell membranes wherethey contribute to membrane fluidity, but otherwisehave very few direct biological effects. Rather, thedietary essentiality of LA and ALA is based on theirrole as precursors for the biosynthesis of longer-chain omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids that helpregulate in the body.ALA is the \"parent\" omega-3 fatty acid and can beelongated and desaturated by the horse to form ei-cosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3) and DHA (22:6n-3). In the omega-6 family, LA competes for the sameelongase and desaturase fatty acids are known to have signicant effects on inflammation and immune responses, attributed inpart to their ability to give rise to various eicosanoids(prostaglandins, prostacyclins, leukotrienes, andprotectins). ARA, EPA, and DHA can also alter cellreceptor signaling, gene expression, and protein syn-thesis, ultimately impacting the biological response totrauma and infection. Both omega-6 and omega-3fatty acids contribute to normal inflammatory and im-mune responses, but the relative abundance of ome-ga-6 versus omega-3 fatty acids in cell membranes cansway the nal outcome. In simplistic terms, eico-sanoids derived from ARA stimulate stronger pro-in-flammatory responses, whereas those originating fromEPA produce weaker inflammatory reactions. Itmust be emphasized, however, that it is really thebalance of the different eicosanoids and mediators pro-duced that generates the nal biological response. Research on omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in humans and other species has demonstrated areduction in inflammation and positive impacts oninnate and acquired immunity through modicationof the expression of key cell surface proteins andmodulation of the production of reactive oxygen spe-cies, eicosanoids, and cytokines. 33,34By compari- son, research in horses has revealed variableoutcomes with either ALA (via flaxseed or flax/lin-seed oil) or EPA and DHA (via sh oil, marine algae,or seal blubber) addition to the diet. In some stud-ies ARA-derived eicosanoids and pro-inflammatorycytokine production from ex vivo stimulated equine immune cells have been reduced, 35-39whereas other studies have observed no effect of omega-3 fatty acidsupplementation on inflammatory mediators. 36,37,40 Use of an intradermal injection of phytohemagglu-tanin A to evaluate a coordinated inflammatoryresponse in vivo revealed an earlier response in yearling horses supplemented with either flaxseedor sh oil compared with nonsupplemented con-trols. 40Linseed oil supplementation also failed to improve markers of inflammation and clinicalresponse to endotoxin administration in vivo. 41 Function of immune cells has also been variable inresponse to omega-3 fatty acid enriched diets.Although often shown to be suppressed by ome-ga-3 fatty acid intake in humans, 34ex and oxidizebacteria were not affected in horses supplementedwith flax or sh oil. 39,40,42One study even re- ported an increase in lymphocyte proliferation inneonatal foals born to mares supplemented withlinseed oil. 43Conflicting observations have also been made on the impact of omega-3 fatty acidsupplementation on acquired immunity in horses.Omega-3 fatty beenshown to increase 39or have no impact36,42on an- tibody production in response to antigen or vacci-nation administration. Interestingly, the higherantibody response to tetanus vaccination in year-lings fed sh oil was similarly elevated in year-lings supplemented with corn oil (rich in omega-6)compared with non-supplemented controls. 39 Owners and trainers have interest in feeding ome- ga-3 fatty acids to horses with (or to prevent) osteo-arthritis and other inflammatory disorders; butagain, strong research support for this application islacking. Lesion size in Culicoides hypersensitive horses showed a trend to be reduced when fed lin-seed oil compared with corn oil 44and with flaxseed compared with bran supplementation.45Supple- mentation with EPA and DHA has shown variableeffects on systemic or synovial inflammatory mark-ers in healthy sedentary or exercised horses, 46-50 but did show a trend to reduce markers of jointinflammation in response to experimentally-inducedsynovitis. 51In the only study conducted in ar- thritic horses, supplementation with EPA and DHAfor 90 days resulted in fewer white blood cells and atrend for reduced inflammatory markers in synovialfluid, but no improvement in lameness. 52In a small number of horses with recurrent airway ob-struction (asthma), supplementation with seal blub-ber oil (a source of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids)did not improve pulmonary function or clinical signsover that seen with sunflower oil (a source of ome-ga-6 fatty acids). 53In contrast, reduction in neu- trophils in bronchoalveolar lavage, 60%improvement in cough score, and 48% reduction inrespiratory effort was reported in 4 horses with in-flammatory airway disease after treatment with anoral supplement containing small quantities of DHA(1.5 to 3 g), along with vitamin C (2 to 4 g), MSM,and \"mushroom complex.\" 31The American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine has since recom-mended omega-3 fatty acids (1.5 g DHA/day or 3mg/kg BW) for the treatment of inflammatory air-way disease. 54It is worth noting, however, that this level of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation issubstantially lower than the daily intakes (50 to 75mg total omega-3 per kg BW) shown confer anti-inflammatory or immuno-modulatory benets inmany of the equine research trials described above. Although the dose of omega-3 fatty acids may be responsible for some of the disparities between stud-ies, the differing outcomes are likely heavily influ-enced by the horse's health status, the omega-3 source,and basal diet. Based on work in horses and otherspecies, individuals are most likely to respond toomega-3 fatty acid supplementation when they aresuffering from chronic when sup-plemented with the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acidsEPA and DHA (from sh oil or marine algae)compared with ALA (from flax). Further, unlike atraditional Western diet for humans, it must be recog-nized that the horse already consumes a diet naturallyhigh in omega-3 fatty acids. Forages, although low a 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: FEEDING FOR FITNESSfresh grass or hay may be sufcient to offset the higher omega-6 fatty acid content from cereal grains, soybeanmeal, rice bran, and common vegetable oils included intoday's equine rations. In fact, even accounting forthe lower availability of fat from forages, most equinerations will still possess a better ratio of omega-6 toomega-3 than the ideal 5:1 to 10:1 recommended forhumans. 57 Collectively, research ndings in horses suggest that omega-3 fatty acids can modulate immune re-sponse, particularly that of inflammation, but moreresearch is needed to verify the practical value ofusing omega-3 fatty acids to attenuate inflammationand pain in horses with chronic inflammatory dis-eases (e.g., osteoarthritis, asthma). Future re-search should also examine the benets of omega-3fatty acid supplementation during periods of physi-ological stress (e.g., transport, exercise, weaning),immuno-insufciency (e.g., neonatal pituitary parsintermedia dysfunction). Additionally, needed to determine the appropriateamount of omega-3 fatty acids needed to influenceimmunity, as well as the potential importance ofomega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid ratio in equine diets.Lastly, it omega-6 fatty the \"bad guy\" of equine nutrition, and insome cases (as highlighted above), LA has even beenshown to promote positive immune responses inhorses. Claims that excess omega-6 intake pro-motes inflammation remains an active area of de-bate in humans, 58as well as horses. 4. Use of Prebiotic and Functional Fibers to Maintain Gut Health Over 70% of the immune system is associated with the gastrointestinal tract. In fact, the gut servesas one of the most important rst lines of defenseagainst infection by pathogens. Therefore, itcomes as no surprise that some components of thediet can influence immunity by affecting the mi-crobial ecology of the gut and/or interacting withthe gut-associated mucosal immune system. 59 Some types of dietary ber (carbohydrates that can- not be digested by the horse's own enzymes) have beenshown to positively affect health by 1) supporting thecolonization of benecial commensal bacteria in thegut (which are themselves an important barrier topathogens); 2) supporting gut epithelial tissue throughthe production of short-chain fatty acids such as bu-tyrate; 3) binding to pathogens, thus blocking themfrom attaching to the intestine; and 4) interacting di-rectly and indirectly with immune cells associatedwith the gut mucosa to modulate the immune system(both locally in the gut, and systemically throughoutthe body). 59These unique bers are generally re - ferred to as prebiotics. Although not all prebiotics arebers, most are oligosaccharides (bers consisting of 2to 20 units), including fructooligosaccharides(FOS), galactooligosaccharides (GOS), and xylooligo-saccharides. Additional bers that are thought to have prebiotic-like effects include mannanoligosaccha-rides (MOS), beta-glucans, and pectin. These bersare abundant in mare colostrum and milk. 60They can also be found in the cell walls of yeast, some cerealgrains (e.g., oats, barley, wheat), and forages, thoughoften in the form of longer-chain polysaccharides.Enzymatic feed technologies have been used to createoligosaccharides from raw feedstocks and ber-richcoproducts for use in animal diets. Additionally, mi-crobial fermentation of hemicellulose and other bersin the tract liberate shorter-chainmannan arabinoxylan oligosaccharides sub-sequently immunomodulatory effects, in addi-tion to generating short-chain (volatile) fatty acids asan energy source for the animal. 61 Early work on prebiotic supplementation in horses focused on changes on gut microbial popula-tions and improvements in digestion. More re-cently, investigations have explored the impact ofprebiotics and prebiotic-like bers on immune func-tion. Sh ifts in cytokine production by cells, as well as increased immune cell viability were ob-served by Vendrig et al. 62in an in vitro model of inflammation where immune cells isolated from horses were incubated with GOS, GOS /H11001FOS, or GOS/H11001 FOS/H11001 acidic-oligosaccharides and then stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide.Work in broodmares has shown higher IgA con-centrations in colostrum yeast containing MOS and beta-glucans.64Additionally, whole- cell killed yeast-supplemented mares and theirfoals had lower fecal IgA and IgG, suggesting adownregulation or quieting of the inflammatorygut immune response. 64Although not fed in the diet, broodmares receiving weekly intramuscularinjections of a yeast-derived beta-glucan in lategestation had higher IgG, IgG(T), and IgM co-lostrum and their foals had higher IgG(T) in se-rum and improved neutrophil function. 65In contrast, oral of beta-glucan (170mg/kg BW) supplied to mature, sedentary horsesin the form of a high beta-glucan oat variety or aconcentrated oat beta-glucan powder did not mit-igate changes in leukocyte populations or alterlymphocyte or neutrophil function, mucosalIgA in response to a head-elevation chal-lenge. 66Older horses receiving a proprietary yeast-derived prebiotic were reported to havelower tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferongamma (in serum, and gene expression by lympho-cytes stimulated ex vivo) compared with unsupple- mented controls. 67A follow-up study utilizing the same prebiotic showed an increased responseto influenza vaccination in aged horses. 68These ndings show potential for prebiotics to counter-act age-associated inflammation /H114082020 79HOW-TO SESSION: FEEDING FOR FITNESSCollectively, prebiotics have demonstrated some promise in horses that may have compromised or in- sufcient immunity; however, additional investigationis needed to ascertain which prebiotics are effectiveand in which scenarios their use is most appropriate.In the meantime, emphasizing a ber-based diet (e.g.,high quality forages, beet pulp, soybean hulls) shouldcontribute to a healthier gastrointestinal tract. 5. Conclusions The application of immuno-nutrition to the horse is arelatively new area of study. As horse owners seekcomplementary and holistic methods to maintain thehealth of their horses, interest in nutrients that posi-tively impact the immune system is gaining momen-tum. All nutrients are important for supporting hostdefense; thus, it is important to ensure minimum nu-trient requirements are being met. For most healthyperformance horses, this means selecting high-qualityforages and appropriately formulated concentrates.Some nutrients (e.g., omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin C)have also demonstrated their ability to modify im-mune function in some populations when fed aboverequirements. Supplementing the diets of healthyhorses with these immunomodulating nutrients is notlikely to be of benet\u2014their immune system is alreadyfunctioning well and cannot be further \"improved.\"However, in horses with compromised immunity (e.g.,strenuous osteoarthritis, of the diet with immunomodu-lating nutrients may help mitigate or reverseperturbations of the immune system. There is stillmuch to learn on this topic in horses, including agreater understanding of synergistic (or antagonistic)effects between nutrients.

Introduction Mild equine asthma is associated with dust expo- sure. The purpose of the study was to compare respirable dust exposure and bronchoalveolar la-vage (BAL) fluid cytology between racehorses fed dry hay, steamed hay, and haylage. 2. Materials and Methods Thoroughbred racehorses (n /H1100573) were randomly assigned to be fed hay, steamed hay, or haylage for6 weeks. A BAL was performed at baseline andafter 3 and 6 weeks. D ifferential cell counts were performed on cytospin preparations. Respirabledust was measured gravimetrically at the horse'sbreathing zone on 2 occasions. Mixed modelswere constructed to examine the effect of forageassignment upon BAL fluid cytology and respira-ble dust. Adjusted P-values /H11021.05 were consid- ered signicant. 3. Results and Discussion Airway cytology data were obtained from 69 horsesat week 3 (hay /H1100524, steamed hay /H1100521, haylage /H11005 24) and 53 horses at week 6 steamedhay/H1100518, haylage /H1100518). hay (0.078 /H110060.037 mg/m3;P/H11021 .05). Horses eating haylage had a lower proportion of BAL fluid neutrophils at week 3 ( P/H11005.025) and 6 (P/H11005.003) compared to baseline and to hay at week 6(P/H11005.04). Horses eating haylage exhibited a de- crease in mast cell proportions only at week 3 ( P/H11005 .008). Steamed hay and haylage reduced respira-ble dust exposure, while only haylage signicantlydecreased airway inflammation.

Introduction Supplements containing turmeric (TUM) and devil's claw (DC) are commonly fed to horses to decreaseinflammation and pain. The purpose of this studywas to determine whether feeding a supplement con-taining these botanicals caused worsening of gastriculcer scores, decreased body weight, increased gastricjuice pH, or altered blood parameters in horses. 2. Materials and Methods Twelve Thoroughbred horses with equine gastric ulcer syndrome (EGUS) scores /H110220 were assigned to either the treatment (TUM/DC supplement) or control (sup-plement without TUM/DC) group. The supplementswere fed daily for 28 days. Gastroscopy was per-formed on days 0, 14, and 28. The EGUS, non-glan-dular ulcer number and severity (NGS), and glandularnumber and severity scores were recorded. Bodyweight, gastric juice pH, packed cell volume, total pro-tein, and blood analyzer values were evaluated ondays 0 and 28. A mixed ANOVA model was usedwith signicance set at P/H11021.05. 3. Results Mean EGUS and NGS scores were signicantlylower in both treatment and control groups by day14 and 28 when compared with day 0. Only twohorses in the treatment group had glandular lesions,which resolved by day 14 and remained resolved byday 28. Blood parameters, body weight, and gas-tric juice pH did not change. 4. Discussion The supplements did not cause worsening of squa-mous ulcers. Further investigation in more horseswith glandular pathology is needed to determine itseffect on these lesions. 86 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: FEEDING FOR FITNESS Research Abstract /L50093for more information, contact the corresponding author NOTESAcknowledgments The Authors acknowledge the Equine Health Stud- ies Program for support of this research and alltechnical staff for their assistance with the project,as well as SmartPak Equine for providing the sup-plements and funding for this study.

Introduction While the majority of horses and foals with colic respond to medical management,1-3early identica- tion of those with a strangulating obstruction isimperative. The goals should be to manage themajority of horses/foals medically, without delayingsurgery in those with a strangulation thereby max-imizing the likelihood of an uncomplicated recoveryand successful return to their intended use. Care-ful consideration of the patient history and detailedphysical examination can help with early identica-tion of an intestinal strangulation or at least promptthe use of additional diagnostic tests. 2. Signalment and History Knowing the patient signalment and obtaining adetailed history provides information that can beused to formulate a differential diagnosis list for thehorse with colic, develop a treatment regimen, anddevise a colic prevention plan. Recording the his-tory as part of the medical record is also importantto provide accurate information for referral, for ref-erence in the case of future colic episodes, and aspart of a preventative medicine program.3. Signalment While gas colic is by far the most common diagnosisacross most age, breed, and sex categories, 1,2the signalment is critical for forming a differential diag-noses list. Gas colic can be dened clinically byhorses with mild-to-moderate pain that resolvesspontaneously or with a single dose of an analgesicdrug and accounts for about 70-80% of colic epi- sodes. 1Examples of diagnoses that should considered the torsion; BASICS: THE ACUTE ABDOMEN IN THE FIELD NOTESsociated with a mesenteric rent, small colon injury, uterine involution Colt or is also important because it may directthe history taking process 1) if you are presentedwith a mare showing colic signs, the reproductionstatus requires investigation; 2) if you have an olderhorse, underlying diseases should be considered;and 3) in the case of a neonate, questions pertainingto parturition, passive transfer of maternal antibod-ies, and clinical signs shown by other foals on thefarm should be asked. 4. Obtaining the Patient History Obtaining a thorough and accurate yet succinct pa-tient history (Table 1) involves asking a few initialkey questions of the owner/caregiver, keeping theowner/caregiver focused on answering the questionsthoroughly and concisely during an often stressfulsituation, and then recognizing areas of the patient'shistory that require a more in-depth discussion thatmay take place following the physical examination.Having a standardized history sheet for horses withcolic can assist in obtaining a complete history witheach case. While history taking is traditionally incorporated into the rst part of the patient evaluation, it is impor-tant to recognize that the entire history does not need tobe obtained prior to examining the patient. However,there are a few very pertinent historical facts that mayalter your initial approach to patient care and are typi-cally obtained over the telephone prior to arrival on thefarm including specic signs being demonstrated by thepatient, duration of colic signs, and reproductive status ofmares (initial history). The owner/caregiver should be able to describe specically the signs being shown by the horse orfoal. The term, \"colic,\" is often used to describe anyequine patient that is not quite normal. Recum-bency and signs of dull demeanor and inappetenceare often described as colic. While these signs maybe associated with colic, other disease processesshould also be considered. Persistent recumbencyis more typical of a horse with neurological disease,severe laminitis, trauma with musculoskeletal in-jury, debility, or shock from other causes. Dull de-meanor and inappetence can be associated with anysystemic disease process (e.g., colitis, pleuropneu-monia, hepatic or renal disease, anaplasma) as wellas problems of the head and neck regions. Signs specic for the horse with colic include paw- ing at the ground, flank staring, kicking at the ab-domen, and rolling. If the horse is not showing anyof these signs, it is likely to have another problemrather than colic. Colic signs are often described asmild, moderate, or severe: Mild colic signs include intermittent flankstaring and kicking at the abdomen, inappe-tence, lying down, and occasional rolling.Table 1. Pertinent History-Taking Questions for Equine Colic Cases45 Initial history What specic signs is your horse showing? What is the duration of time over which your horse has been showing these signs? Have the signschanged over this time? What is the reproductive status of the horse? Appetite, water consumption, defecation, urination Has the horse's appetite and water consumptionbeen within normal limits? Has the horse urinated or defecated recently? Whenwas the last time? What was the consistency offeces? Management What is the duration of time the horse has beenunder the current ownership? What is the horse's current feeding regimen? Dentalcare? What is the horse's water source? Is the horse stalled or on pasture? What is the horse's exercise regimen? What is the intended use of the horse? Has there been any change in diet, water source,housing, or exercise regimen? Has the horse traveled recently? Where and when? What is the horse's vaccination and deworminghistory? Medical history Has the horse had signs of colic previously? Previouscolic surgery? Does the horse have any other medical problems? Is the horse currently being treated with anymedication? Has any medication been administeredfor this episode of colic? Has the horse had a previous surgical procedure? Are the other horses on the farm healthy? Does the horse have any stable vices such as cribbiting or windsucking? Specic for Mares Is the mare pregnant (Yes/No)? Days of gestation? Estimated due date? Have there been any problems during thispregnancy (Yes/No)? If yes, what problems? Have there been problems with previous pregnancies(Yes/No)? If yes, what problems? Number of previous pregnancies/foals? Has mare recently foaled (Yes/No)? When? Was parturition normal (Yes/No)? If no, what were the problems? Did the mare pass her placenta normally (Yes/No)? Was the foal normal (Yes/No)? If no, what were the problems? Has the mare had previous colic associated withpregnancy or the periparturient period (Yes/No)? If yes, what was cause? AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 89BACK TO BASICS: THE ACUTE ABDOMEN IN THE FIELDModerate signs include more persistent rolling but the horse can be distracted and remainsstanding when walked. The horse may besweating. Severe signs of colic are persistent rolling andthrashing, with difculty keeping the horsestanding when it is walked. The horse is gen-erally covered in sweat and often has multipleabrasions to its head, tuber coxae, and limbs. Clinical signs shown by the horse should also beinterpreted with regard to any analgesic medicationthe owner may have administered. The change inclinical signs over time should also be noted e.g.,horses with large colon volvulus may have a historyof several hours of mild-to-moderate colic that hasrecently become markedly more severe and horseswith gastric or cecal rupture may have had a historyof variable degrees of pain that has progressed to nofurther signs of pain and shock (sweating, musclefasciculations, reluctance to move). While the owner/caregiver can rarely give an ac- curate time of when the colic signs actually began,they should be able to tell you 1) when the signswere rst observed, and 2) when the horse or foalwas last observed to be normal. Knowledge of atleast an approximate duration of signs is importantwhen performing a differential diagnosis list (e.g.,mild colic for 24 hours may indicate a large colonimpaction whereas a strangulating lesion is typi-cally associated with an acute onset of severe pain).Duration of colic is also vital for determining a di-agnostic and treatment plan including the use ofdiagnostic tests such as transabdominal ultrasono-graphic and radiographic examination in horses with recurrent colic, route of fluid therapy, andwhether or not to refer the horse. Knowledge of a mare's reproductive status is crit- ical because management of colic in periparturientmares can be particularly challenging from a diag-nostic and therapeutic perspective. A more detailed history can then be obtained once the degree of pain and enough information to havean initial impression of the patient status has beengathered. The detailed history can provide infor-mation pertaining to the likely cause of the currentcolic episode as well as identify potential manage-ment factors to change to prevent future colic. 5. Appetite, Water Consumption, Defecation, and Urination Whether or not the horse has been eating, drinking, defecating, and urinating can provide an overall im-pression of general wellbeing of the patient. Thisinformation may not be available if the horse residesat pasture, particularly if the horse is at pasturewith other horses. The owner/caregiver should beasked about the horse's recent feed intake, whetheror not the horse's appetite has been normal, andwhether or not the horse has been drinking an ac-ceptable volume of water. Nutritional needs ofhorses are extremely variable and observation ofbody condition score is likely the best way to deter- mine the adequacy of nutrition. Whether thehorse's appetite has changed and any associated changes in body condition as well as the period oftime over which this has occurred are important tonote. Water consumption is variable and depen-dent on the body weight of the horse, ambient tem-perature, type of feed, activity level, and pregnancyor lactation status. Typically an adult horse willconsume 35-70 L of water a day or about 7%-15% oftheir body weight. Horses require 2-3 L of waterper kg of dry feed intake. The last observed defe-cation amount and consistency should be noted.Normal fecal output in an adult horse is 6-8 piles ofsoft to rm formed feces a day. Whether or not thehorse has been observed to urinate or there wereseveral wet areas in the stall should be determinedand used to assess hydration status and renalfunction. 6. Management Type of feed provided, method of feeding, frequencyof feeding, and if there has been any change infeeding regimen should be ascertained and may berelated to the colic signs. 4 Specic hay types have been associated with cer- tain causes of colic: Coastal Bermuda grass hay,which is fed in the Southeastern United States, hasa strong association with ileal 5and possibly cecal impactions; been associated withfeeding alfalfa hay 6-8; and poor-quality hay and hay in round bales has been associated with colic.9 Other examples of relationship between feed typeand colic include the association between colic andfeeding large amounts of concentrate (e.g., /H110222.5 kg/ day dry matter), 10,11which alter the contents of the colon and may increase tympany and colonic dis-placements 12; equine gastric ulcer syndrome and high concentrate diets13; and sand colic has been associated with feeding on the ground in areas withsand or gravel. Horses typically graze for about 18hours each day and management practices of manyhorses do not necessarily mimic the horses' naturalgrazing habits. Many studies on colic have foundan association between colic and less pasturetime. 9,11,14Alteration in diet and feeding practices may be necessary to manage colic in some horses.In several studies an association between change infeed or feeding regimen and signs of colic has beenidentied. 9,10,11,14,15The incidence of colic is also higher during the spring and possibly autumnmonths, which tend to be associated with a changein feed particularly for pasture-fed horses. 15,16 Lack of dental care has been associated with co-lonic impactions. 14 Access to ponds is associated with a decreased risk of colic compared to other water sources.17Lack of access to water is also associated with colic.18Own- ers should be aware of the potential consequences of afreezing water source during the winter months. 90 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: THE ACUTE ABDOMEN IN THE FIELDThe water source may not necessarily freeze but become cold during the cooler months; water tem-perature was found to affect consumption duringcold but not hot weather. 19,20During cold weather, horses with only warm water available drink agreater volume each day than if they have only icycold water available; however, if they have a choicebetween warm and icy water, they drink almostexclusively from the icy water and drink less vol-ume than if they have only warm water available.While the higher incidence of impactions occurringduring the winter months 15may be associated with housing and diet, inadequate water intake duringthese months may also be a contributing factor.Mineral content of water should also be consideredin areas where horses are predisposed to enteroli-thiasis. 10,11All horses should have a readily available source of fresh, palatable water avail-able and water intake monitored when possible. An increase in the number of hours in a stall and decrease in exposure to pasture and recent changein exercise regimen increased the risk for colic andsimple colonic obstruction and distention. 9,14Horses that are housed for 19-24 hours a day are at a partic-ular risk for colic compared to horses at pas-ture. 9,10,14,17Pasture access and duration of access, however, have been associated with risk of equinegrass sickness in non-US geographical regions. 21 Recent transportation has been associated with colic. Horses that had a history of travel in theprevious 24 hours had an increased risk of simplecolonic obstruction and distention compared tohorses that had not been transported. 14Stress, change in diet/water consumption, and possibly re-stricted movement are likely related to the associa-tion between travel and colic. There has also beenan association between transportation and salmo-nellosis. Transportation had a major role inreactivating Salmonella sp. infection in carrier po- nies 22and horses with a travel time to the hospital /H110221 hour were at an increased risk for sheddingsalmonella compared to horses with a shorter traveltime. 23 Knowledge of where the horse has previously re- sided as well as when and for how long the horse wasin that region may help with diagnosis. W hile there may not be an association between geograph-ical region and occurrence of colic, 16specic types of colic tend to occur in different regions: Enterolithiasis is particularly common inCalifornia. 7,8 Ileal impaction is associated with horses resid-ing in the southeastern United States. 5 Sand colic occurs in horses residing in regionswith sandy soil such as Arizona, California,Florida, New Jersey, and Delaware. Duodenitis-proximal jejunitis is geographi-cally variable with California having a lower incidence compared to other regions and thedisease seeming to occur with greater severityin the southeastern compared to the northeast-ern United States. 24,25 History of anthelmintic therapy including the an-thelmintic(s) used, frequency of administration, andresults of monitoring of parasite burden need to beobtained. While historically Strongylus vulgaris (large red worm) was associated with colic, with thedevelopment of ivermectin-based anthelmintics therole of S. vulgaris in colic has diminished. 4Anaplo- cephala perfoliata (tapeworms) have should be part of theanthelmintic regimen. Cyathostomes (small redworms) have been associated with cecal and largecolon lesions 4,27,28and Parascaris equorum (round worms) struction, rupture, peritonitis, intussusception, or abscessation in foals.4,29Monitoring of resistance of these parasites to routinely used anthelmintics isrecommended on large farms. Horses that werenot treated with an ivermectin- or moxidectin-basedanthelmintic within the previous 12 months 12or were not on a regular deworming program6were predisposed to colic and horses recently adminis-tered an anthelmintic were at a decreased risk ofcolic. 9Recent anthelmintic administration, how- ever, within 7-8 days was associated with colic10 and ascarid impactions.29Vaccination history is also important particularly in cases where it maynot be clear that the horse is showing signs of colic. 7. Medical History Horses that have had previous colic surgery andprevious episodes of colic are predisposed to col-ic. 10,11,14,16-18Horses with a large colon volvulus and displacement necessitating surgical correctionwere signicantly more likely to colic after surgery ifthey had more than one episode of colic prior to theone necessitating surgery. 30,31The specic diagno- sis and procedure performed during a previous colicsurgery often provides an indication of the cause ofcolic e.g., colonic displacements and large colon vol-vulus have a tendency to recur and horses havinghad small intestinal or small colon surgery are pre-disposed to adhesions. Often owners/caregiversmay be aware of previous colic or colic surgery butwith no knowledge of the specic lesion. Owners/caregivers should be encouraged to keep records ofthe horses under their care so that this informationis readily available to the attending veterinarian.The frequency and severity of previous colic episodesshould be recorded. Recurrent colic warrants amore in-depth diagnostic work up, albeit not neces-sarily on an emergency basis. Knowledge of current or recent medication includ- ing dose rate, route, and frequency of administrationthat the horse is or was receiving is critical so thattreatment can be continued should the horse become AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 91BACK TO BASICS: THE ACUTE ABDOMEN IN THE FIELDhospitalized; drug toxicity that may be manifest as colic can be identied; and treatment for colic withpotentially toxic drugs does not result in toxicityfrom overdosing. There are certain causes of colic associated with a particular medical history. Acute colitis should beconsidered in horses with a history of antimicrobialdrug administration. Horses with colitis can ini-tially show signs of colic that progress to dull de-meanor and diarrhea. Colitis should be consideredparticularly in horses with a fever. Cecal impac-tion should be considered in horses with a history ofrecent surgery or stall connement for an injury. Recent lameness has been associated with colonicimpaction. 14Right dorsal colitis should also be considered in a horse presenting for colic and diar-rhea with a history of nonsteroidal anti-inflamma-tory drug use. Whether or not the owner has administered any medication for the current episode of colic, includingthe route of administration, dose rate, and fre-quency, should be noted. Knowledge of recent medical problems of other horses stabled at the same location may be useful to determine a diagnosis and assist with recommenda-tions for prevention and treatment. Stable vices, such as crib biting or windsucking, have been recently associated with colonic colic andepiploic foramen entrapment. 32 8. Physical Examination Physical examination, along with obtaining a thor-ough patient history, remains the cornerstone ofgood veterinary medicine. Information obtainedduring physical examination of the colic patient isused to conrm that the horse has gastrointestinaldisease and determine the severity and possiblecause, direct analgesic and fluid therapy, make de-cisions with regard to medical or surgical treatment,and provide the owners with some indication ofprognosis. Meticulous medical records are neces-sary so that trends over time can be observed, allabnormal ndings can be noted, and informationcan be accurately and completely communicated ifreferral is necessary. Should the horse have recur-rent colic, comparison of physical examination nd-ings on each occurrence can be made. Examiningthe colic patient begins with making several initialobservations. Physical examination should beginwith a rapid assessment of the patient's cardiovas-cular stability. Once a rapid patient assessment isperformed and the horse is determined to be cardio-vascularly stable or unstable, the physical examina-tion can be completed. Of note is that when usingvarious physical examination ndings for patientassessment, observation of trends over time and useof multiple indices is more useful than the use of oneindex at one point in time.9. Initial Observation Patient examination begins with a careful 30-60- second observation. Particular attention should bepaid to the horse's body condition. Poor body con-dition may be an indication of an underlying diseaseprocess, inadequate nutrition, or poor dentition.Demeanor or attitude is described as bright, alert,and responsive; quiet and alert; dull, or obtunded.Horses with colic are generally bright and alert.On the other hand, horses with colitis, proximalenteritis, or peritonitis, including gastrointestinalrupture, tend to have a dull demeanor. Abnormaldemeanor should also be considered with someneurological diseases or toxicity. Assessment of de-meanor should take into consideration recent seda-tive/analgesic drug administration. Evidence ofinappropriate sweating can be an indication of se-vere pain or shock. Abdominal distention whenmild can be difcult to assess unless the veterinar-ian is familiar with the horse's normal abdominalcontour. Moderate-to-severe abdominal distentionis more easily discernible and is generally an indi-cation of a large intestinal obstruction. One excep-tion is a small intestinal mesenteric root volvulus.Asymmetry of abdominal distention can providesome evidence of the type of lesion (e.g., when thehorse is standing squarely, horses with a nephro-splenic entrapment may have more distention onthe left side and cecal tympany or impaction mayresult in more apparent distention on the right sideof the abdomen). Abrasions occurring on the head,tuber coxae, and limbs are an indication that thehorse at least at some point was showing signs con-sistent with severe abdominal pain. A strangulat-ing obstruction should be considered in any horsewith abrasions, even very small abrasions, associ-ated with colic. Occasionally, a horse will be exam-ined for an apparent primary laceration, unbeknownto the owner/caregiver and veterinarian that thehorse sustained the injury during an episode of colic.Therefore, when evaluating a horse with trauma ofunknown origin, colic should be considered as a po-tential cause and warrants careful observation. The degree of pain should be assessed. Signs of abdominal pain may be observed initially; however,horses with mild colic are often easily distracted andmay not demonstrate signs when being restrained.Once an initial physical examination is completed, itis recommended to allow the horse to be unre-strained in a stall for a brief period so that the signsof colic can be carefully observed, prior to adminis-tration of sedation if the horse is not particularlypainful. It is often during this observation periodthat it is determined if the horse truly has colic(more common) or has other disease process such asneurological disease. Severity of pain along with degree of abdominal distention, and frequency of intestinal borborygmi can be used to evaluate the colic severity. 33,34 Moderate-to-severe colic observed during the initial 92 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: THE ACUTE ABDOMEN IN THE FIELDexamination, persistent colic, and return of colic signs following provision of analgesia is associatedwith the need for surgery. 33Although poorly doc- umented, older horses (late teens and older) tend toless readily and less dramatically demonstrate colicsigns compared to younger horses (yearlings and2-3-year-olds) and foals and this should be takeninto consideration. 10. Rapid Assessment of Cardiovascular Status The cardiovascular status of the horse can be as-sessed quickly and thoroughly to determine theseverity of disease and the need for emergency re-suscitation with intravenous fluids (Table 2). Thecardiovascular status of the patient can be rapidlyassessed by obtaining a heart rate and examiningthe oral mucous color, moistness, pro-vide more specic information with regard to hydra-tion, vascular volume, and tissue perfusion. Notethat a nasogastric tube should be passed immedi-ately in any horse with a heart rate /H1102260 beats/ minute because it can be an indication of pendinggastric rupture. Older foals and weanlings tend tohave a variable heart rate that is slightly higherthan that of an adult; however, the heart rate shouldbe within the adult range by 6 months ofage. Tachycardia is generally an indication of painor shock. In colic patients, tachycardia up to 60beats/minute can be associated with pain alone.Once the heart rate is /H1102270 beats/minute, the horse is likely to have some degree of shock. Shock isdened as insufcient oxygen delivery to the cellleading to inadequate cellular ATP production anddepletion of ATP supply. Failure of the energy(ATP)-dependent Na /H11001/K/H11001pump ultimately results in cell death. Tachycardia is one compensatorymechanism associated with sympathetic stimula-tion to increase cardiac output and oxygen deliveryto the tissues. Because of its association with painand shock, heart rate has a strong association withprognosis for horses with colic. 35-40Heart rate along with packed cell volume (PCV) and blood lac-tate and plasma creatinine concentrations are a good indication of the degree of shock, likelihood of postop-erative complications, and prognosis for survival.Alpha-2 agonists (i.e., xylazine and detomidine) causea reflex bradycardia and heart rate measurementsshould be interpreted in light of recent medication.The effects of the alpha-2 agonists should have sub-sided within 1-2 hours of administration. Tachycar-dia that is inconsistent with other clinical ndings(e.g., a horse with a heart rate of 90 beats/minute andno other clinical indication of pain or shock) may beassociated with an arrhythmia. An electrocardio-gram should be obtained. Arrhythmias are uncom-mon in colic patients but may include ventriculartachycardia or atrial brillation. Normal mucous membranes should be pale pink and moist. The CRT time should be /H110212 seconds. Injected membranes that are bright pink to red withTable 2.

Severely injected red to purple mu-cous membranes are generally associated with gas-trointestinal tract rupture, colitis, or an extensiveand prolonged strangulating obstruction. Abnor-mal mucous membranes have been used in modelsto estimate colic severity score. 41Tachycardia with pale mucous membranes may be membranes moist.Tacky mucous membranes are an indication of mild-to-moderate dehydration (i.e., loss of total body wa-ter with loss of water from the interstitial tissue)and may be corrected with either enteral or intrave-nous fluids. Dry mucous membranes are associ-ated with moderate to severe dehydration. Drymucous membranes may be observed in horses witha prolonged duration of colic or causes of colic inwhich a large volume fluid is lost into the gastroin- testinal tract. Severe dehydration should be treatedwith intravenous fluids. Prolonged CRT is observed in horses with hypovolemia and poor tissue perfu-sion and is an indication for intravenous fluidtherapy. Jugular rell time is measured by holding off the jugular vein in the lower neck and observing thetime taken to ll the vein. Jugular rell timeshould be seconds in a jugular rell (/H110223 seconds) is generally associ-ated with more serious causes of colic and indicateshypovolemia and the need for intravenous fluids. Extremities (distal limbs, ears, nose) should be warm to the touch. Cool extremities generally rep- resent poor tissue perfusion as a result of peripheralvasoconstriction to maintain circulation of vital or-gans. Ambient temperature should be taken intoconsideration when evaluating extremity temperature. The pulse can be palpated in the facial artery and should be easily palpated, regular, and strong.With signs of hypovolemia and poor cardiac outputthe pulse quality will deteriorate to become barelypalpable. During the hyperdynamic phase of shockbounding pulses may be palpated. 11. Evaluation of the Gastrointestinal Tract The gastrointestinal tract is evaluated initially byausculting the four abdominal quadrants for borbo-rygmi. Normal borborygmi have a constant low- grade rumbling associated with gas and fluidmoving through the gastrointestinal tract. Horsesthat have been inappetent or had feed withheld usu-ally have hypomotile borborygmi. An absent of bor-borygmi is generally associated with the need forabdominal surgery 41and typically noted in horses with strangulating intestinal obstructions. Hyper-motile intestinal borborygmi can occur with mild-to-moderate colitis. Disparity in intestinal borborygmi between the left and right side of the abdomen maybe used to identify the lesion site (e.g., intestinalborborygmi may be decreased on the left side in ahorse with a nephrosplenic entrapment and theright side in a horse with a cecal impaction). Sandaccumulation can be auscultated in abdomen caudal to the xiphoid processand is similar to the sound produced if a paper bagwere partially lled with sand and slowly ro-tated. 42,43The gastrointestinal function is also assessed based on historical information and obser-vation. The horse's appetite, fecal output and con-sistency, and degree of abdominal distention areused with auscultation of borborygmi to completethe initial assessment of gastrointestinal function. 12. Rectal Temperature Rectal temperature should be performed prior toabdominal palpation per rectum to obtain an accu-rate measurement. Rectal temperature should bewithin normal limits for horses (99-101\u00b0F [37.2-38.3\u00b0C]) and foals (100-102\u00b0F [37.8-38.9\u00b0C]) withcolic. Reasons for a high rectal temperature arehyperthermia (an elevated body temperature due to failed thermoregulation) or fever (elevation of temper-ature above the normal range due to an increase in thebody temperature regulatory set-point). Fever is re-sponsive to treatment with anti-inflammatory drugsand is typically more common in horses with colic.Colitis, enteritis, peritonitis, or a respiratory tract infection should be suspected in horses with pyrexiaparticularly if the rectal temperature is /H11022102\u00b0F (38.9\u00b0C). Horses do not typically develop pyrexiaassociated with stress or pain. Endotoxemia, how-ever, does produce a fever and, therefore, a mildfever may be observed in horses with colic, particularlythose with strangulating obstructions. 13. Respiratory Rate and Evaluation of the Respiratory System Normal respiratory rate should be 8-12 breaths/ minute. Normal respiration in the adult horse isbarely visible by observing the nares or thorax/ab-domen. Horses with pain, fever, shock, or respira-tory tract disease will have a high respiratory rate.The most common reason for a high respiratory ratein a horse with colic is pain. Nostril flare will beobserved and is a subtle yet important indication ofpain particularly in stoic patients (e.g., geriatrichorses). Respiratory rate has been associated withprognosis for short-term survival in a few retrospec-tive studies 35,36,38,41but is more likely an indication of pain necessitating intensive medical or surgicaltreatment. Horses with shock are usually severely tachy- pneic. Marked abdominal distention can cause in-adequate ventilation and tachypnea in an effort toexchange adequate air with a decrease in diaphragmcompliance. T rocharization may be indicated in such cases. Fever can lead to a high respiratory rate. Tachy- pnea with respiratory rates /H1102240 breaths/minute and even/H11022100 breaths/minute adrenergic ag-onist (i.e., detomidine). 44Tachypnea was observed for at least 1-5 minutes following drug 94 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: THE ACUTE ABDOMEN IN THE FIELDadministration and was also associated with a likely unrelated antipyretic effect.44While the response of febrile horses to sedation with xylazine or deto-midine can be dramatic, it does not appear to nega-tively impact the health of the patient. Occasionally, a horse or foal showing signs of colic will have underlying respiratory tract disease.A thorough examination of the respiratory systemshould be performed in these horses. Completeevaluation of the respiratory system involves exam-ination of the nares for discharge and odor; historyof a cough; ability to elicit a cough with trachealpalpation; percussion; and thoracic and trachealauscultation without and then with a rebreathingbag to identify wheezes/crackles and areas with poorair movement. The response to the rebreathing ex-amination should be assessed with most horses notbecoming distressed during the examination andhaving a normal respiratory rate within 1-3 breathsfollowing removal of the bag. Distress, coughing,and prolonged recovery should be considered abnor- mal and warrants further diagnostic tests. Thoracicultrasonographic and radiographic examination andtranstracheal wash to obtain a sample for cytology andbacterial culture and sensitivity testing can be per-formed if signs are localized to the thorax. 14. Digital Pulses Laminitis is uncommon in horses with colic and is arelatively rare postoperative complication, the excep-tion being horses with colitis, enteritis, or peritonitis,and those developing a high fever. However, horseswith a previous history of laminitis do anecdotallyappear to be predisposed. Digital pulses should bepalpated on the initial examination and the hooftemperature and any signs of lameness noted toestablish a baseline to which future assessments canbe compared. Obtaining a detailed history and performing a thorough physical examination, not the least ofwhich are some careful observations of the patient,should help with the decision to continue with med-ical management, pursue additional diagnostic tests in the eld, or refer for further evaluation andtreatment.

Introduction A critically important component of the examination of a horse with acute abdominal pain is abdominalpalpation per rectum. Although only 25-35% of theequine abdomen is palpable per rectum, rectal ex-amination ndings play an important role in thediagnosis of the underlying cause of colic signs andoften contribute to a decision for the need for surgi-cal exploration when combined with other clinicalndings. Abdominal palpation per rectum shouldbe performed in all horses presenting to a veterinar-ian for assessment of acute abdominal pain, unlesscircumstances such as size or temperament placethe horse or veterinarian at unnecessary risk ofinjury. In addition to the acute abdominal patient, horses with a history of persistent or recurrent colic,chronic diarrhea, chronic weight loss, or fever ofunknown origin are good candidates for a thoroughabdominal examination per rectum. 1 Certain conditions may be denitively diagnosed via palpation per rectum, such as feed pelvic flexure, herniation of small intestinethrough the inguinal canal in a stallion, and uterinetorsion. There are many others conditions whosediagnosis can be facilitated by palpation per rectum,including, but not limited to, gas distention of colon cecum, most experi-enced clinicians feel condent in their diagnosis based on palpation per rectum, numerous studieshave identied a marginal degree of accuracy be-tween preoperative or antemortem diagnosis and the denitive diagnosis. For example, a study eval-uating cases of inguinal hernia reported that 13 of27 cases were missed during the initial evaluation, 2 and in a study of 59 cases of surgically treated ne-phrosplenic entrapment, 34 had lesions other 3Sim- ilarly, cecal impaction is a frequently missed diag-nosis, with only 14 of 48 horses correctly diagnosedon initial examination. 4 The key points in this review of abdominal palpa- tion per rectum in the horse with colic include rec-ommendations for p reparation and technique for optimizing diagnostic capabilities and safety, de-scription of normal anatomic structures, and abnor- mal palpation ndings for specic conditions. 2. Preparation and Technique The most critical component of transrectal palpationis proper restraint to ensure a safe procedure for the AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 97BACK TO BASICS: THE ACUTE ABDOMEN IN THE FIELD NOTESpatient, the examiner, and the handler. Conse- quences of inappropriate or inadequate restraint could include a catastrophic iatrogenic rectal tear forthe patient and bodily harm to the examiner. It isimportant to have an experienced handler, standingon the same side as the examiner, and ideally, thehorse is restrained within stocks. Horses exhibitingunrelenting pain or those resistant to palpation shouldbe properly sedated for the examination IV). The addition of butorphanol is optimal for thesafety of the examiner to lessen the potential to bekicked. The use of a nose twitch may also be ap-plied by an experienced handler if further restraintis needed. If palpation feels restricted despite se-dation due to peristaltic activity, excessive gas dis-tension, or generalized tension within the rectum, alow or therapeutic dose of N-butylscopolammoniumbromide d(0.15-0.3 mg/kg IV) can be administered to promote relaxation of the smooth muscle of thegastrointestinal tract, temporarily abolishing peri-stalsis and rectal pressure. Even at the low dose,the effect is profound, occurring within 1 minute ofadministration, and potentially lessens the riskof iatrogenic injury to the rectum in addition toimproving the diagnostic capability of the examina-tion by allowing a greater exploration of the abdom-inal cavity with reduced resistance from straining.Some veterinarians prefer to use a 50- to 60-ml doseof topical 2% lidocaine HCl ein the rectum; however, this has been shown to be inferior to N-butylscopol-ammonium bromide for rectal relaxation. 5The au- thor occasionally uses a 60-ml volume of lidocaineinfused directly into the terminal rectum of horsesthat exhibit muscular stenosis of the anal sphincterduring by using a catheter-tipped sy-ringe but prefers N-butylscopolammonium bromideto improve diagnostic capabilities. Ideally, an at-tempt at palpation prior to administering N-bu-tylscopolammonium bromide will have occurred toboth assess whether a dose is indicated (e.g., strain-ing is present) and to get a more accurate represen-tation of the degree of colon distension present, as inthe author's experience, N-butylscopolammoniumbromide markedly \"softens\" the feel of a distendedviscus. Also recall that it will increase heart rateand blood pressure and the impact on heart rate willpersist for up to an hour. 6 To begin the examination, apply a rectal sleeve that is liberally lubricated with carboxymethylcellu-lose. The hand and arm should be gently advancedinto the rectum and distal descending (small) colonas far as possible while complying with any peristal-tic contractions, sometimes requiring backing out inpart to avoid excessive pressure on the rectal wall.Be particularly wary of any explosive movements,such as those associated with a cough or an agitatedhorse resistant to palpation. As much fecal mate-rial as possible, if present, should be evacuated priorto beginning the palpation, and fecal characteristicsshould be noted as they may assist in diagnosis.Deep extension of the arm into the abdomen willallow for a more thorough exploration. A strategic and consistent approach to palpation will reap the greatest benets for identication ofgastrointestinal lesions, keeping in mind that manyhorses will present limitations based on the degreeof distension or lack of relaxation. First, begin withidentication of the left kidney and associated ne-phrosplenic ligament and proximal border of thespleen normally present against the left body wall.Next, examine the right dorsal quadrant, payingparticular attention to the vertically oriented ven-tral band of the cecum and its location in relation tothe large colon. Then, examine the right ventraland left ventral abdomen for the presence of nor-mal and abnormal visceral distention and position.Last, palpate the more caudal structures within thepelvic canal as the arm is extracted. A thoroughexamination will, in most instances, provide infor-mation about the segment of intestine involved andthe severity of the condition, with a denitive diag-nosis possible in several instances, when evaluatedin context with other clinical ndings. 3. Normal Anatomy Structures that are expected to be palpable in thenormal horse include the caudal pole of the leftkidney, lying in the left dorsal abdomen, with itsassociated nephrosplenic ligament, extending fromthe ventrolateral aspect of the left kidney toward thehilus of the spleen on its axial, visceral surface.The dorsocaudal border of the spleen is palpable aswell and should feel smooth with sharp borders.The descending colon with its distinctive fecal ballsand mobility will often be the most prominent fea-ture in the normal horse within the left dorsocaudalabdominal quadrant. Centrally along the dorsum,the descending aorta may be palpable, and itsquadrication into the left and right internal andexternal iliac arteries should be identied. Theventral band of the cecum is a key landmark in theright dorsal to central abdomen, recognizable by itsvertical orientation in the abdomen and extendingfrom the right caudodorsal body wall cranioven-trally toward midline, with the right dorsal and ventral quadrants. Fullextension of the arm into the abdomen is often nec-essary to identify this landmark. A small amountof gas is normally palpable within the cecum, butthere should be no tension on the ventral band andcontent should be very soft or fluidy. The duode-num courses caudal to the cecal base and is not oftenpalpable in the absence of pathology or distension,as with the rest of the small intestine. The pelvicflexure, or at least components of the left ascendingcolon, should be palpable within the left ventralquadrant, containing soft digesta in some instances.The pelvic flexure is recognized by its diameter,presence of soft digesta, and smooth surface charac- 98 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: THE ACUTE ABDOMEN IN THE FIELDTable 1. Common Conditions and Expected Findings on Transrectal Palpation in Horses with Acute Abdominal Disease Abnormal Condition Expected Findings SI obstruction Nonspecic small intestinal distention is an indication of either a functional or mechanical obstruction. One or more loops of fluid- or gas-distended SI will be evident as slippery and smooth tubular structures generally between 4-8 cm in diameter. A distended orthickened duodenum may be palpable as a horizontally positioned loop in the dorsal andcentral to right abdomen as it courses around the base of the cecum. Ileal impaction Generalized SI distention is palpable in 96% of cases with 25% having a palpable impaction. 7This may be evident as a rm, tubular structure in the center of the abdomen just medial to the cecum. Herniation of SI through an inguinal ringGeneralized SI distention may be present. A taut band of mesentery and associated SI will be palpable coursing into an inguinal ring, just cranial to the brim of the pelvis. Painmay often be elicited with traction on the mesentery or ileocecal band/cecum. Palpationof the scrotum should be performed on every stallion with acute, severe colic. Intussusception Jejunojejunal intussusception results in generalized SI distention with rare ability to palpate the intussusception as a markedly thickened, palpate but, in rarecircumstances, may be identied as a turgid, tubular mass in the RD abdomen withinthe cecum. 1 Duodenitis/proximal jejunitis Proximal enteritis will most commonly have evidence of generalized SI distention, unless early in the disease process. The duodenum may more likely be palpable in these casesand occasionally may have a slightly thickened feel. Degree of distention of SI typicallyis not as severe as with strangulating SI obstructions. LC impaction secondary to SI obstructionWith any form of SI obstruction, the LC ingesta will often become dehydrated secondary to loss of fluid input from the SI. In this case, the colon will feel rm but often has adistinctive feel with prominent taenia and haustra and a more uneven rm surfacereminiscent of a \"shrink-wrapped\" feel of desiccated ingesta. This is commonlymisinterpreted as a primary LC impaction, resulting in delays in appropriate treatmentfor SI disease. LC primary impaction of the pelvic flexureWith impaction of the pelvic flexure, the colon will feel enlarged with doughy to rm contents within the smooth, pelvic flexure, usually extending into the adjacent dorsal orventral left colons. The colon will be stretched and smooth, unlike the feel of desiccatedcontent secondary to SI obstruction. LC primary impaction of the RD colonRD colon impaction likely represents the most common area of LC obstruction, but its diagnosis is presumptive in most cases. As the RD colon is beyond reach during rectalpalpation in all but the smallest horses with the largest impactions, the diagnosis isbased on clinical ndings, history, and absence of fecal output. Expected ndings are alack of abnormalities. LCV LCV is most commonly characterized by extreme large colon distension, sometimes to the point of not being able to extend the arm into the abdomen beyond the wrist. Colonicwall thickening may be appreciated and associated with venous congestion and edema.Taenia may course horizontally as the colon expands to t within a limited space.However, early LCV may not have distention present with limited distinguishingfeatures on palpation. It is often unnecessary and unsafe to palpate the LCV patient dueto unrelenting pain dictating a clear need for surgery or euthanasia. Ultrasonographicexamination can facilitate a rapid diagnosis by the detection of colonic wall edema in theventral abdomen. LDD\u2014nephrosplenic entrapment The primary characteristic of a LDD is palpation of most of the colon on the left side of the abdomen, combined with the ability to follow the taenia of the colon cranially anddorsally on the left, coursing lateral to the left kidney. The proximal border of the spleenwill remain against the left body wall but will be displaced ventrally. When severe colondistention is present, diagnosis may be more difcult and palpation of the left kidneyand spleen may be obscured by the colon. RDD RDD may occur in a few congurations but, by denition, requires movement of the left ventral and dorsal colon to a location on the right, lateral to the cecum. In manyinstances, the left colon will exhibit a 180-degree volvulus and the prominent taenia andhaustra of the left ventral colon will be evident dorsally and traveling cranially on theright side of the abdomen. If colon distention does not obscure identication of theventral band of the cecum, a more denitive diagnosis can be made when the ventralband is identied medial to the large colon. It is common to palpate distended colonwith taenia horizontally positioned and traveling cranially to the right, or on occasion,the pelvic flexure will be immediately identiable within the pelvic inlet. Following thecolon from the pelvic flexure will reveal its track to the right body wall, lateral to theventral band of the cecum. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 99BACK TO BASICS: THE ACUTE ABDOMEN IN THE FIELDterized by the absence of distinct taenia and haus- tra, which is an anatomical feature of the ventralcolon. It is not abnormal to be unable to identifythe pelvic flexure, as it will undergo some naturalmovement in the abdomen and may be indistinct iflacking digesta. Colonic tenia in the left abdominalregion should course cranially and remain on the leftside of the abdomen, to the left of the ventral cecalband. Other palpable structures include uterus and ovaries in the mare, inguinal rings in the stal-lion, and the bladder, particularly when distendedwith urine. The mesenteric root may sometimes bepalpable but only when under some degree of ten-sion under abnormal conditions. 4. Abnormal Anatomy Table 1 describes characteristic ndings identiedupon palpation per rectum that are associated witha variety of conditions causing colic. Illustrationsand animated clips of many of these conditions canTable 1. (continued) Abnormal Condition Expected Findings Enterolithiasis\u2014LC Obstructive enterolithiasis of the LC is often characterized by a lack of any abnormalities on transrectal palpation. History and clinical signs are critical in these cases to consider this diagnosis in the absence of abnormalities on palpation. When complete obstructionoccurs within the transverse colon, large colon and cecal distention will be evident. Enterolithiasis\u2014SC Obstructive enterolithiasis involving the descending or SC is most commonly characterized by progressive abdominal distention with gas due to both cecal and large colon gasaccumulation. A baseball-sized enterolith may SC fecaliths can occasionally upon palpation as very rm, fecal impactions within the SC accompanied commonly by extensive SC, LC, and cecal gasdistention. The SC can be distinguished by its small and presence ofcharacteristic mesenteric and antimesenteric taenia. SC impaction A true SC impaction does not consist of rm, stacked fecal balls but, rather, is a pathologic impaction secondary to SC inflammation. It is nearly always preceded by anepisode of diarrhea that subsequently becomes desiccated, resulting in a rm, tubularsegment of variable length. Careful palpation will identify the antimesenteric taeniathat distinguishes SC from the pelvic flexure or SI. The other distinctive nding inmany of these cases is edema of the rectal wall with a fragile feel to the wall. Cecal distension The cecum may become distended with fluid and/or gas as either a primary (impaction/ dysfunction) or secondary process. A fluid-lled cecum will be characterized by a tightventral band, often pulled ventral and slightly toward the left. When severe, gas-distended cecum may be difcult to differentiate from LC oftenoccur cupula impaction cecal cupula (cranial aspect of the cecal base) and are palpable as a large diameter, digesta-lled, indentable viscusin the RD to central abdomen. They can sometimes be distinguished from LC impactionsby their diameter and identication of the vertically oriented ventral cecal band over thecaudal surface. As the cecum is attached to the dorsal body wall, palpation may helpdistinguish a cecal impaction from a LC impaction as the hand cannot pass dorsallyalong the surface of the distended cecum. 4 Cecal dysfunction Cecal dysfunction most commonly follows elective procedures, often including NSAID use. Early signs may consist of increased tension in the ventral cecal band. Perirectal mass Perirectal masses commonly present for colic secondary to a rectal impaction and subsequent tenesmus. A thorough, circumferential palpation of the perirectal region willfacilitate diagnosis, as it is easy to bypass the region during palpation and fail torecognize the mass. Ruptured viscus The ndings on rectal palpation for horses with a ruptured GI tract will depend, in part, on the location of the rupture along with the duration and degree of gas present in theperitoneal cavity. If a moderate quantity of gas is present, this will eliminate the normalnegative pressure within the peritoneal cavity, providing unusually free movement ofthe arm during palpation. Other common ndings are emphysema or a gritty texture onserosal surfaces. These ndings will be accompanied by signs of septic shock in allinstances. Intra-abdominal abscess A large, extraluminal mass may be palpable in the central abdomen, sometimes arising from mesenteric lymph nodes. Alternatively, they may be secondary to smallperforations of bowel and be located in variable locations. Diagnosis may be facilitatedby transrectal ultrasound along with history and other diagnostic ndings.

There are several conditions that may be incor- rectly diagnosed based on transrectal palpation.These are worth mentioning, as an incorrect diag-nosis can often result in delays in denitive treat-ment, ultimately affecting prognosis. The rst ofthese is a diagnosis of large colon impaction whenthere is a small intestinal obstruction (often stran-gulating obstruction). Small intestinal obstructionresults in sequestration of fluid in the stomach andsmall intestine with desiccation of colonic contents,which is exacerbated by dehydration and hypovole-mia. The result is a \"shrink-wrap\" feel, with undu-lations on the surface of the colon, rather than astretched taut viscus typical of large colon impac-tions. Another commonly missed diagnosis is cecalimpaction, as it is sometimes mistaken for a largecolon obstruction but can have much more seriousconsequences (e.g., rupture) and require consider-ably more extensive therapy for resolution. Due tothe dorsal mesenteric attachment, it is not possibleto pass your hand over a distended cecum. Youcan, however, pass your hand over the top and to thelateral side of a displaced colon. The third condi-tion that is commonly misdiagnosed is masses of theperirectal region. All horses exhibiting tenesmusor presenting with a rectal impaction should have athorough examination of the rectum and perirectalregion for the presence of masses, such as perirectalabscessation or neoplasia. Studies have also indi-cated marginal accuracy of palpation per rectumupon initial presentation inguinal herniaand nephrosplenic entrapment. 5. Summary Transrectal palpation is a critical component of thediagnostic examination in the acute colic patient.The procedure can be performed safely when usingthe tools available, from facilities and skilled han-dlers to pharmacologic assistance. In combinationwith history and other clinical ndings, it can some-times provide a denitive diagnosis but commonlywill assist in determining the severity of the diseaseprocess and contribute to information regarding theneed for surgical intervention. A thorough knowl-edge of normal and expected abnormal anatomy iscritical for the successful use of transrectal palpa-tion as a valuable diagnostic tool in the colic patient.

Introduction Doctor of medicine surgeons and criticalists, and later small animal criticalists, were the rst to in-troduce the idea of localized sonograms, which wasformally added to the literature in the 1990s. Thegoal was to perform fast sonograms in trauma situ-ations that would decrease the time from presenta-tion to an emergency room to the decision to take thepatient to surgery or to perform computerized to-mography. A protocol was designed that could beperformed by clinicians without advanced imagingtraining. The sonograms could be performed si-multaneously with other emergency proceduresand were rapid, inexpensive, noninvasive, and non-radiating. This technique is called Focused Assess-ment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST). A4-window protocol was designed and successfullytested prospectively. Currently, many variationsof the procedure exist, titrated to different clinicalsituations, and a considerable effort has been placedin dening the diagnostic accuracy and structureof these protocols. In 2011, a group of equine clini-cians from the University of Liege in Belgium 1 published the use of Fast Localized AbdominalSonography of Horses (FLASH). In this study, 7 windows were described and reported an acceptablediagnostic ability of this protocol for detecting smallintestinal obstructions and the need for exploratory laparotomy. Detection of small intestinal strangu-lations is perhaps one of the highlights of this pro- tocol (Fig. 1). It is important to remember that sonographic eval- uation is only a small part of the assessment of a horsewith acute colic. It is a useful tool, but not all horseswith acute colic need an abdominal sonogram, andthere are many other parts of the evaluation of thehorse with acute colic that need to be considered.Signalment, history, and physical examinationgive the clinician the most important information,and diagnostic aids complete the assessment.These data are ltered through the clinician'sbrain to establish a diagnosis, or differential diag-nosis list, a prognosis, and a therapeutic plan.This cycle can be repeated as many times asneeded depending on the progression of the horse. The ideal instrument used to perform a sonogram in a horse with colic is a large convex probe. Por-table or ultraportable machines are able to obtaindiagnostic images for these scans. Many currentultraportable machines have built-in software thatallows remote assistance (telemedicine/teleconsult-ing), and this is likely to become a commonly usedtool in the near future as this technology becomeseasier to use in all types of equipment. Spraying 102 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: THE ACUTE ABDOMEN IN THE FIELD NOTESalcohol or using warm water is sufcient to obtain an adequate image for a FLASH in most horses.The goal is to perform the scan in less than 10minutes. The seven windows of the original FLASH are ventral window, gastric window, left middle thirdwindow, splenorenal window, right middle thirdwindow, duodenal window, and thoracic window.The concept of having a xed tested protocol withknown specicity and sensitivity is ideal. A slightmodication of this protocol has been developed tot the sonogram within a typical colic work-up andmakes it faster and potentially more specic. Theprotocol and goals of each window are in the follow-ing sections. Nephrosplenic Window The probe is placed between the dorsal and middlethirds of the abdomen at the level of the 17thintercostal space or paralumbar fossa. In normalhorses, the left kidney is seen medial to the spleen(Fig. 2A). Visualization of the left kidney in thiswindow virtually rules out nephrosplenic entrap-ment. In the images in this manuscript, dorsal orcranial is to the right. The diagnosis of a nephrosplenic entrapment is the main goal of the nephrosplenic window. A non-visible kidney is not pathognomonic for nephro-splenic entrapment. Horses with dorsal dis-placements (e.g., colon isgas lled and positioned dorsal and sometimes lat-eral to the spleen but not in the nephrosplenicspace). Some horses appear to have a colon dorsalto the spleen without colic signs. In horses with anephrosplenic entrapment, the left kidney is notvisible and the colon is seen dorsal to the spleen inthe paralumbar fossa; and in the caudal intercostalspaces, the dorsal edge of the spleen is not visible,the spleen and stomach are displaced ventrally, and,in many cases, a mesenteric vessel is visible adja-cent to the medial border of the spleen (Fig. 2B andC). The latter sonographic sign is the consequenceof most entrapments presenting a 180-degree rota-tion of the colon that makes the medial colonic ves-sels visible. 2 Fig. 1.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 103BACK TO BASICS: THE ACUTE ABDOMEN IN THE FIELDGastric Window For this window, the probe is placed in the 10th intercostal space in the mid abdomen and movedcranially and caudally. At this point, a stomachtube has likely been or is simultaneously beingpassed. The sonogram helps decide the degree ofgastric distension. In some cases in which reflux isnot obtained, a sonogram shows distension with in-gesta or that the tube is not in the stomach. Inthese cases, this visual helps the clinician realizethat further lavage or repositioning of the tube isnecessary. Fig. 3 provides an example of a normalgastric window. The splenic vein and the \"doublecontour sign\" interfaces viscus observed is thestomach. The echogenicity helps determine thegastric contents. Echoic contents casting a com-plete shadow are consistent with ingesta, as shownin Fig. 3A. Fig. 3B shows a fluid-lled stomach.Also note that a stomach tube is visible in this imageas a double hyperechoic echo casting an acousticshadow. Hyperechoic contents casting a dirty acous-tic shadow or showing a mirror image artefact are consistent with gas. The number of intercostalspaces and the shape of the stomach can assist indetermining the degree of gastric distension. Thestomach can be followed cranially by scanningacross intercostal spaces. normal stomach canoccupy 3-7 intercostal spaces depending on whenand what the horse has eaten. A stomach wallshould appear rounded (Fig. 3A and B). A stomachthat becomes flattened is consistent with gastricdistension. An enlarged stomach lled with in-gesta and flattened against the abdominal wallraises concerns about a gastric impaction. Ultra-sound does not allow a characterization of the con-sistency of ingesta, and the remaining examinationndings and, particularly, results of gastric lavageare necessary to make a diagnosis. There can beintermittently collapsed, motile loops of small intes-tine with normal wall thickness between the spleenand the stomach in normal horses. If there is dis-tended thickened small intestine between the spleenand stomach, a gastrosplenic entrapment may besuspected. The appearance of a thickened also be suggestive of gastritis or gastricedema. Ventral Window This view is split into two different windows. Cranioventral Abdomen The probe is placed in the most ventral aspect of the abdomen (cranioventral) and then moved caudally.In a normal horse, sacculated large intestine is typ-ically observed. This window is useful to see in-creased free peritoneal fluid, distended or thickenedsmall intestine, and thickened large intestine. Thecranioventral window is often used to determine ifand where abdominocentesis will be performed andwith which length/gauge needle or cannula. Theabdominal muscles can be seen meeting at the lineaalba. The thickness of the abdominal wall can bemeasured to determine the length of needle/can-nula. For example, if the wall thickness measures1 cm, then the needle/cannula will need to be 0.5 cmlonger than this measurement, as the tissues arecompressed by the ultrasound probe and the perito-neal lining will be deformed by the tip of the needleor cannula before penetration. Inguinal Area The probe is placed in the right and left inguinal areas and as far caudal as possible. Some horsesmay kick when the probe is placed in this area.It is particularly useful to assess the presence ofdistended or thickened small intestine. In normalhorses, small intestine can be intermittently dilatedor collapsed. A wall thickness of 3 mm is consid-ered normal, although when transiently dilated, the Fig. 3 A, This image shows a normal gastric window. The stomach can be seen adjacent to the spleen and there is ingestawithin the gastric lumen. B, This image shows a fluid-lledstomach with a nasogastric tube in place. 104 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: THE ACUTE ABDOMEN IN THE FIELDthickness is expected to decrease. The motility of a normal small intestine is continuous. The most relevant ndings in a ventral window are as follows: Distended peritoneal fluid withincreased lactate concentration). The normalsmall intestine is usually collapsed. Mildlydistended small intestine can be seen withfasting or hypomotility. Sedation may de-crease motility cause Functional obstruc-tion (ileus) or mechanical obstruction like anileal impaction (Fig. 4) causes moderate ormarked distention, and sedimentation of di-gesta occurs over time. Thickened nonmotiledistended small intestine is typically causedby a strangulating obstruction necessitatingsurgical correction. Enteritis could cause thisappearance, but the thickening tends to bemild and diffuse in cases of enteritis. Theremaining clinical presentation can help indifferentiation. Thickened large intestine. The presence ofthickened large intestine needs to be placedinto the clinical context and several differentialdiagnoses considered. Large colon volvulusand colitis are the most common differentialdiagnoses for a horse with thickened large in- testine. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)/lymphoma, a displacement with obstruction ofvenous return, and rare large intestinal inl-trative diseases are other differentials. 3The literature can be somewhat misleading for thediagnosis of large colon volvulus. In a horsewith acute colic and severely thickened colonin the ventral abdomen, a colon volvulus is themost likely diagnosis, but this nding is notpathognomonic. 4,5Fig. 5 compares the sono- graphic appearance of a horse with a largecolon volvulus and another horse with severecolitis (salmonellosis). The absence of saccu-lations in the ventral window has been sug-gested as a sign of volvulus. Because theventral colon is sacculated and the dorsal colonis not, seeing nonsacculated colon ventrallyhas been suggested to be a sign of a 180-degreerotation. Colonic distension associated with adisplacement or impaction or in horses with acolon fuller than average can cause the ventralcolon to become nonsacculated, and this nd-ing cannot be relied upon for the diagnosis oflarge colon volvulus. Paying attention to thelayering pattern may help rank the differen-tial diagnoses, but this type of detailed sono-gram is difcult to perform in emergencysituations, and their discussion is beyond thedescription of FLASH. Increased fluid. Peritoneal fluid echogenicitycan vary between peritonitis, hemoabdomen, Fig. 4. Moderately distended compressible nonthickened small intestine in a horse with an ileal impaction.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 105BACK TO BASICS: THE ACUTE ABDOMEN IN THE FIELDtransudate, and ruptured viscus. Fluid with spontaneous contrast (smoke) is characteristicof hemoperitoneum, whereas hypoechoicfluid can be consistent with transudate ormodied transudate. Fig. 6 shows a sono-gram of a horse with large particles sugges-tive of intestinal rupture. In such cases,pneumoperitoneum can often be seen accom-panying the echoic fluid in horses with intes-tinal rupture. Hyperechoic contents casting a complete shadoware suggestive of sand. This may take someattention and experience to recognize. Thecolon may become flattened against the ven-tral abdomen if the volume is large enough tomake the ventral colon lose its normal haus-trations. In Fig. 7, the sonographic imageand radiograph show a mare that presentedwith chronic diarrhea diagnosed with sand en-teropathy that responded to a course of psyl-lium and magnesium sulfate. In cases ofsand impaction, the colon will be flattened anddistended, and in cases of enteropathy, thewall can be thickened, hypervascular, or havean altered layering pattern. The sensitivityof ultrasound to detect sand is high, but itsability to assess the amount of sand ispoor. Radiographs are better than ultra-sound at determining the amount of sandand the clinical relevance of the sonographi-cally visible sand. 6 Left Middle Third Window The FLASH protocol says \"freely move the probe inthe left mid abdomen.\" Freely moving the probe isnot recommended in a protocol that should bespecic and fast. The probe should be moved fromthe diaphragm to the costochondral junction in 3intercostal spaces in the mid abdomen (usually15-13 intercostal space [ICS]). Spleen and stom-ach or spleen and colon are often seen in thiswindow. This window is key for diagnosing ne-phrosplenic entrapments. The colon remains dor-sal to the spleen, the dorsal edge of the spleen is notvisible, and, in many cases, a colonic vessel is seenadjacent to the medial aspect of the spleen, which isindicative of a 180\u00b0 rotation of the entrapped colon,as shown in Fig. 2. Duodenal Window The duodenum can be imaged ventral to the rightkidney and medial to the right liver lobe. Fig. 8Ashows the normal appearance of the duodenum me-dial to the right lobe of the liver, and Fig. 8B showsthe appearance ventral to the right kidney. Theduodenum can be distended in cases of mechanicalor functional obstruction of the small intestine.The duodenum can be thickened in cases of duo-denitis or IBDs. Sedation will affect motility,and the presence of a nasogastric tube can intro-duce air. The appearance of the duodenum israrely specic for the cause of acute colic. Fig. 6.

B, Corresponding abdominal radiograph of ahorse with a sand impaction. 106 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: THE ACUTE ABDOMEN IN THE FIELDRight Middle Third Window The FLASH protocol says \"freely move the probe in the right mid abdomen.\" Freely moving the probe isnot recommended in a protocol that should be spe-cic and fast. The probe is moved from the dia-phragm to the costochondral junction in 3 inter-costal spaces in the mid abdomen (usually 14-12ICS). It is useful to image displaced mesentericvessels. Fig. 8 demonstrates that the diaphragm,the right lobe of the liver, and, medial to it, the rightdorsal and ventral colon and duodenum can all beidentied. When the probe is moved in a ventraldirection, you can identify the remaining right ven-tral colon and cecum. With the exception of the vessels in the lateral cecal band, there should be no vessels adjacent tothe abdominal wall. If vessels in the right middlethird window are observed, this can be indicative ofa right dorsal colonic displacement or a large colonvolvulus. In cases of large colon volvulus, the colonwill likely be thickened. In Fig. 9, mesenteric ves-sels are seen and the colon wall thickness is normal;this horse had a right dorsal displacement. 7If there is distended thickened small intestine be-tween the right lobe of the liver and the colon, anepiploic foramen entrapment should be suspected.The lateral cecal band is added in this window todifferentiate it from a colonic vessel. The lateralcecal band has a small vein, an artery, and lymphoidtissue. Lymph nodes are small and even hard tosee in normal horses. The cecal band is normallylocated more caudal and ventral than displaced co-lonic mesenteric vessels. tissue largerthan the vein is consistent with mesenteric lymph- Fig. 8.

Thoracic Window The probe is in the level of the ventral thorax in the6th intercostal space. Normal horse lung and dia-phragm can be imaged moving while the horsebreathes. In many horses, pericardial fat can beseen in this location. If a cause of acute colic is notidentied on the abdominal FLASH windows, it isimportant to rule out pleurodynia secondary to pleu-ropneumonia with this thoracic window. In horseswith pleuropneumonia, variable amounts of pleuralfluid and a hypoechoic wedge-shaped lung consis-tent with consolidation are often seen. Diaphrag-matic hernias with fluid, small intestine, or the liverin the chest are also readily identiable. Hernia-tion of the large intestine is more difcult to iden-tify, as gas-lled large intestine can display similarhyperechoic echoes to the lung. In summary, abnormalities that are likely to be identied in a FLASH are as follows: nephro-splenic or be identied are the ones that will haveabnormalities outside the seven FLASH windowsand the ones for which advanced training andmore thorough and extensive characterization areneeded to recognize. Examples of such etiologiesinclude intussusceptions, disease of the urinarytract or liver, masses outside the windows, orsome impactions. FLASH is not a quick abdominal ultrasound. It is a specic protocol developed for specic patientpopulation: the adult horse with acute colic. Themajor potential limitation of the FLASH protocol islower sensitivity than complete sonogram performedby a specialist, but this limitation is typically ac-cepted in favor of an easy-to-learn, shorter, stall-sideexamination that targets high-yield windows. Asfor all sonograms, FLASH should be interpreted inlight of signalment, history, physical examination,and other diagnostic aids. More about the diagnos-tic accuracy of this protocol will be learned, butcurrently, only the ability to detect small intestinalobstructions and the need for exploratory laparot-omy have been tested. FLASH is a very usefultechnique for evaluating the horse with acute colicbut cannot replace a full abdominal ultrasono-graphic evaluation for horses with a clinical presen-tation different than acute colic.

In those pa-tients with a clear need for referral for surgicalintervention, these diagnostics may provide help-ful prognostic information for the owner, but abalance between time required to perform an ab-dominocentesis and the need for rapid surgicalintervention must also be considered. In thosepatients for which referral is not a viable nan-cial option, or in cases of longer-standing dis-ease processes of undetermined etiology, thesediagnostics can be particularly helpful to guidetherapy or decide on euthanasia to end patientsuffering. The key points in this review are indications for abdominocentesis and point-of-care laboratory data(lactate and glucose concentrations) for primary careof the colic patient. A technique summary for ab-dominocentesis will be provided. Clinical scenariosfor eld colic cases beneting most from these diag-nostics will be discussed.2. Abdominocentesis Technique Restraint Before beginning abdominocentesis, proper re- straint of the patient is essential to limit the poten-tial for injury to the examiner. Horses should beproperly sedated for the procedure with an /H9251-2 IV) in combination with butorphanolc(0.01-0.02 mg/kg IV). The use of a nose twitch may also be applied by an experi-enced handler if further restraint is needed. Theveterinarian performing abdominocentesis shouldalways stand forward toward the horse's right frontleg and reach caudally to limit the potential to bekicked from a hind limb during the procedure.The handler should stand on the same side as theexaminer. Choosing a Location and Aseptic Preparation Aseptic technique is essential for abdominocentesis due to entry into a body cavity. Ideally, a briefultrasonographic examination of the proposed re-gion for abdominocentesis should be performed to AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 109BACK TO BASICS: THE ACUTE ABDOMEN IN THE FIELD NOTESoptimize a location and limit the potential for en- terocentesis or inadvertent puncture of the spleen.A good starting point for application of the ultra-sound probe is in the most cranioventral abdomen,just to the right of midline, behind the xiphoid pro-cess and just caudal and axial to the deep pectoralmuscles. A measurement of the depth of the bodywall at the proposed site of abdominocentesis can also be readily performed with any ultrasound probe to assist with determination of which suppliesare needed for successful entry into the peritonealcavity. Once the location for abdominocentesis hasbeen optimized via ultrasound, clipping of hair fol- lowed by a sterile prep of the area should be per-formed. Local anesthesia using a 25-gauge, 5/8\"needle with 2.5-3 mL 2% solution canthen be applied to the subcutaneous tissue, follow-ing a track vertically to the depth of the needle,through the external rectus fascia (Fig. 1). Thisstep may not be necessary depending on the sup-plies used for abdominocentesis. Ultrasonographic ndings favorable for abdomi- nocentesis are free peritoneal fluid at the site, al-though fluid acquisition may be successful in theabsence of sonographically evident peritoneal fluidaccumulation. Other ultrasonographic features tolook for when free fluid is limited, is the presenceof visibly mobile viscera. The presence of largecolon haustra (sacculations) indicates the absence ofheavy colonic content (e.g., sand or gravel) makingthe risk of enterocentesis lower. Lastly, avoid thespleen to limit the potential for blood contamination. Choosing Supplies There are generally 4 options to obtain a sample of peritoneal fluid. These include an 18-gauge, 1.5\"needle, an 18-gauge, 3.5\" spinal needle, a teat can-nula, and a bitch catheter. If abdominal ultra-sound was used to determine the depth from theskin surface to the peritoneal cavity and that dis-tance was equal to or less than 2.5 cm, the 18-gauge,1.5\" needle may be sufcient. Body walls thickerthan 2.5 cm require one of the alternative options.The risk for penetrating a viscus is believed to belower with the more blunt-ended teat cannula andbitch catheter, and the proper use of these bluntinstruments results in a higher likelihood of obtain-ing a diagnostic sample. Abdominocentesis using ateat cannula or bitch catheter is also slightly moredifcult and time consuming. Use of needles is con-traindicated when taut, fluid-lled loops of smallintestine are immediately adjacent to the body wallor palpated per rectum as inadvertent puncture orlaceration of small intestine is likely to result inseptic peritonitis. Technique with Needles Following site selection and aseptic preparation, the 18-gauge needle is inserted through the skin, sub-cutaneous tissues, and external rectus fascia usingsterile gloves to handle the needle. The needle should then be advanced a few millimeters at a time,with a spin of the needle to encourage fluid move-ment. The 1.5\" needle will often need to be insertedto its full length prior to entering the peritonealcavity. Occasionally, a vacuum effect due to thenegative pressure within the abdomen will preventfluid from exiting via the needle, and insertion of asecond needle immediately adjacent to the rstmay allow flow of peritoneal fluid. Alternatively, asmall volume 2-3 mL of air may be injected throughthe needle using a sterile 3-mL syringe. It may bedifcult to discern whether the tip of the needle hasreached the peritoneal cavity. Gentle movement ofthe needle hub is common when within the perito-neal cavity due to movement of intestinal visceraagainst the tip of the needle. Fluid should be col-lected into an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid(EDTA) blood collection tube unless a septic processis suspected where samples should be collected inboth EDTA and sterile red top tubes. Lactate con-centration can be measured from EDTA or heparin-ized tubes. Technique with Teat Cannula or Bitch Catheter The following supplies are required following aseptic preparation and local anesthesia prior to initiatingabdominocentesis: sterile #15 scalpel blade, sterile3/H110033o r4/H11003 4 gauze, teat cannula or bitch catheter, and collection tubes (EDTA /H11006red top tube) (Fig. 2). Following site selection, aseptic preparation and ap-plication of local anesthetic, a stab incision is madethrough the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and externalrectus fascia by the examiner wearing sterile gloves.Avoid injury to small vessels in the skin. In over-weight horses, this may require deep insertion of the#15 blade beyond the primary cutting edge. Theexternal rectus fascia is palpable with the tip ofthe blade and should be recognized and then pene-trated to a depth of 0.5 cm before extracting theblade (Fig. 3). The teat cannula or bitch cathetershould be pushed through the center of a sterile Fig. 1. Local anesthesia with 2.5 mL 2% lidocaine prior to abdominocentesis. 110 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: THE ACUTE ABDOMEN IN THE FIELDgauze pad prior to insertion to protect the sample from blood contamination arising from the skin andsubcutaneous tissues. A second sterile swab maybe used to blot the stab incision site and the instru-ment is inserted through the skin. The tip of theinstrument can then be used to nd the openingcreated through the dense, external rectus fascia,and the cannula is inserted through this layer andthrough the rectus abdominus muscle. A palpable\"pop\" may be recognized as the instrument is furtherinserted through the internal rectus abdominus fas-cia and a nal \"pop\" may be associated with theperitoneum. Pain is often elicited upon tenting andpuncture of the peritoneum. Fluid flow should beanticipated at this point when present. It is criticalto guard the placement by gripping the instru-ment with sterile gloves near the body wall to ensurethe instrument is not forced rapidly into the perito-neal cavity, potentially risking viscus penetration.Keep in mind that the peritoneum will tent awayfrom the blunt-ended instrument, so it may need tobe inserted several inches beyond the measuredthickness of the body wall before the peritoneum ispenetrated. Many standard stainless steel bovineteat cannulas are only 8 cm (3.6\") in length, so if thebody wall is relatively thick, a longer bitch catheteris more likely to yield a fluid sample. Failure topenetrate the peritoneum is a common reason fornot obtaining a sample. Maintenance of the teatcannula/bitch catheter perpendicular to the bodywall is important to limit the potential for dissectionretroperitoneally or through the rectus abdominusmuscle. If uncertain of the position of the cannula,a sterile 6-mL syringe may be rmly attached to theend of the cannula and 5 mL of air may be rapidlyinjected and then aspirated. When in the perito-neal cavity, most air will escape into the abdomenand only a small amount will be retrieved ( /H110212 mL). Lastly, be wary of very rm surfaces with little giveto them such as sand or a very rm impaction.If unsure of the safety of the procedure, considerrepeating ultrasound of the region to nd an optimallocation. Potential complications to abdominocentesis enterocentesis is estimated to be between 2% and5% with secondary complications in 0.5% of cases. 2 In the instance of enterocentesis, the author willinitiate broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy for 1-3days. Indications for Abdominocentesis Abdominal paracentesis is a useful diagnostic aid toassess for the presence of intestinal injury from dis-tention or ischemia in the acute or chronic colic.It has further indications in other processes such asperitonitis or to search for intra-abdominal neopla-sia. With reference to colic in the eld setting, it isappropriate for particular circumstances. As it is arelatively invasive procedure, it is not appropriatefor an initial evaluation of a patient showing mild-to-moderate colic signs that is likely to respond tomedical therapy. For horses sent to referral hospi-tals where the need for surgical intervention is un-clear, it is considered a routine part of the minimumdatabase. In horses with a surgical option, itserves as a helpful guideline for nonstrangulatingobstructions to determine whether further attemptsat analgesia and medical therapy are indicated, or toensure minimal injury is present prior to therapeu-tic procedures such as exercise or rolling. Otherindications are assessment for the presence of astrangulating obstruction versus an inflammatorycondition such as enteritis or colitis. In the eldsetting, the indications for abdominocentesis in theacute colic are when gastrointestinal rupture is sus- Fig. 2. Supplies required for abdominocentesis with a teat can- nula or bitch catheter. Fig. 3. Image demonstrating insertion of the #15 scalpel bladethrough the locally anesthetized BASICS: ACUTE ABDOMEN IN THE FIELDpected, and when a strangulating obstruction is sus- pected but the horse is not eligible for referral andsurgery due to nancial or personal decisions by theowner. It is critical to obtain a denitive diagnosisin these two scenarios to support the indication foreuthanasia and alleviate the suffering of the horse.For horses with suspected gastrointestinal rupture,an ultrasound examination is highly valuable priorto abdominocentesis to ensure the presence of septicperitonitis with increased free peritoneal fluid.A third scenario where it could be helpful is whenthe horse has a nonstrangulating obstruction that isnot responsive to initial medical therapy, and theowners are unwilling to refer. Abdominocentesismay be helpful in guiding progression of disease andin determining how long attempts at medical ther-apy should persist. Lastly, abdominocentesis maybe indicated in atypical or chronic cases to helpguide diagnosis or the need for referral. Interpretation of Peritoneal Fluid Findings The most practical method of peritoneal fluid anal-ysis in the eld colic consists of 3 simple assess-ments. Color is one of the most reliable methodsfor distinguishing nonstrangulating from strangu- lating disorders, with more commonly with strangulating disorders(Fig. 4). 3The second practical method is assess- ment of total protein using a refractometer alongwith general assessment of opacity. Normal peri-toneal protein concentration is 0.8-1.2 g/dL, andhigher concentrations (e.g., /H110222.0 g/dL) suggest in- flammation or injury to the intestine or peritonealcavity. 4It is important to assess protein levels with a minimum volume of 1-2 mL of fluid as EDTAadditives can falsely elevate refractive protein val-ues. 5Lastly, a point-of-care lactate meter can be helpful to distinguish nonstrangulating from stran-gulating obstructions through assessment of the peritoneal fluid lactate to blood lactate ratio. Aperitoneal fluid to blood lactate ratio of /H110222.0 is 64% sensitive and 72% specic for the detection of smallintestinal strangulating obstructions. Serial lac-tate assessments of peritoneal fluid increase bothsensitivity and specicity to detect strangulatingobstructions. 6Serosanguinous fluid color is 90% sensitive and 61% specic for small intestinal stran-gulating obstructions, 7so the combination may be of particular value in decision making in the eld colic.Further assessments in a laboratory setting thatcould be pursued include nucleated cell count, cyto-logic evaluation, glucose, pH, D-dimers, and creatinekinase. When a septic peritonitis or gastrointesti-nal rupture is suspected, some of these additionalassessments can be valuable. Horses with gastro- intestinal rupture may have peritoneal fluid witha gross appearance of particulate material or agreen or brown hue to the fluid or supernatantafter centrifugation, but commonly will have aserosanguinous appearance. Cytologic examina-tion can be highly informative to identify the pres-ence of mixed extracellular bacterial populationswith or without plant material. 3. Point-of-Care Lab Data: Lactate Meter As the majority of data collected on point-of-carelaboratory data has derived from referral centers,more studies are needed to determine their useful-ness in the primary care setting. However, thepoint-of-care lactate meter has become an affordableand readily available option for eld practitioners.Blood lactate can give you an immediate idea ofseverity of a disease process with regard to circula-tory and intestinal compromise, but by itself, doesnot distinguish between strangulating and non-strangulating obstructions. 7It can serve as a use- ful guideline for fluid therapy needs in any acutelyill horse with hypovolemia, 8,9and can be a helpful early prognostic indicator in horses with large colonvolvulus. 10In a study of horses with large colon volvulus, blood lactate concentrations greater than 7mmol/L were associated with a 30% survival rate. 10 Normal blood lactate lies between 0.6 and 1.5 mmol/L. 9As described above, use of a peritoneal fluid to blood lactate ratio as well as serial peritoneal fluid(PF) lactate assessment increase the sensitivity and Fig. 4. Serosanguinous fluid from a horse with a strangulating obstruction. 112 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: THE ACUTE ABDOMEN IN THE FIELDspecicity of lactate for the detection of strangulat- ing obstructions and thus the acute need for surgery.Always keep in mind that blood lactate values in ponies presenting with a primary complaint of gastro-intestinal disease have higher admission lactate con-centrations (2.8 mmol/L vs 1.6 mmol/L) than adulthorses, to avoid overestimating the severity of diseasein that population. 11 4. Point-of-Care Lab Data: Glucometer Hyperglycemia is common in horses with colic andcan be easily and affordably measured using a hand-held glucometer, providing additional evidence to-ward severity of a disease process. Approximately50% of horses with colic admitted to referral hospi-tals have blood glucose concentrations /H11022135 mg/dL, and extreme hyperglycemia ( /H11022180 mg/dL) has been associated with surgical obstruc-tions, and decreased short- and longer-term sur-vival. 12,13Hyperglycemia may occur acutely as part of the stress response to a severe gastrointesti-nal obstruction, but also occurs secondary to glucosedysregulation and insulin resistance that developswith progressive disease. 14Glucose can be a valu- able adjunct to peritoneal fluid analyses when aseptic peritonitis is suspected such as with presenceof cloudy peritoneal fluid. Peritoneal fluid glucoseconcentrations less than 30 mg/dL have been shownto be highly specic for septic peritonitis as well as aperitoneal fluid glucose to blood glucose difference ofgreater than 50 mg/dL. 15It also should be noted that the correlation between hand held glucometersto plasma chemistry analyzers can vary, and it isimportant to ensure calibration for each new re-agent lot is performed, and that test strips are prop-erly stored with regard to temperature andhumidity recommendations. 16 Although less widely utilized, point-of-care tri- glyceride analyzers have also been validated for usein horses, ponies, and donkeys, 17and may provide valuable adjunctive data in horses with morechronic or insidious conditions, as hypertriglyceride-mia is a relatively common complication in anorecticequids. 5. Summary Abdominocentesis is valuable in horses managed inthe eld with acute colic where a decision for eutha-nasia must be made either when surgical interven-tion is not a nancially viable option for the owners,or if gastrointestinal rupture is suspected andshould be conrmed. Other scenarios where ab-dominocentesis may be helpful include recurrentcolic, suspected peritonitis, and for serial assess-ment in horses with persistent nonstrangulatingobstructions not amenable to referral, particularlyif peritoneal fluid can be identied on ultrasono-graphic examination. A brief ultrasonographicexamination at the site of abdominocentesis ishighly recommended to recognize presence of peri-toneal fluid and to avoid injury to viscera or en-terocentesis. Interpretation of peritoneal fluidndings can be readily performed in the eld byvisual inspection and use of a refractometer andlactate meter. Field assessment of horses with colic using a portable lactate meter and glucometer can providevaluable insight into severity of the disease pro-cess to guide therapy or the need for referral oreuthanasia.

Introduction Veterinarians are called on a frequent basis to eval- uate horses that have developed colic. In manycases, the colic will have either resolved or requiresimple medical treatment by the time the veteri-narian arrives. One factor that complicates theveterinary approach to colic is the frequent use ofanalgesics by horse owners and trainers. Althoughthis is often under the direction of a veterinarian,this is not always the case, and can complicate casemanagement. Subsequent to management of pain,other treatments for colic that need to be consideredare use of nasogastric administered laxatives or flu-ids, as well as consideration as to the practicality ofIV fluid therapy. The goal of this presentation is topresent the rationale for the use of differing treat-ments available for management of colic. 2. Recognition of Colic Owners have varying abilities to detect colic in theirhorses. Some owners only notice when the horsehas severe colic, but many notice subtle changes in behavior that are not necessarily clear-cut signs ofcolic. These behavioral signs of colic are n onethe- less important for the veterinarian to consider.As the eld of pain management in veterinary med-icine has dramatically changed in recent years, sohas the veterinarians' ability to detect pain (Table1). 1When an owner calls to report that a horse has abnormal behavior, such as showing a lack of inter-est in feed, there is a reasonable likelihood that theyhave detected behavioral signs of pain, and the mostlikely cause of pain is colic. For example, horseswith early signs of colic tend to stand toward the back of the stall, lose interest in observing otherhorses and people at the barn, and often will notnish a meal. At veterinary teaching hospitals, be-havioral pain scores have been developed to detectsubtle behavioral signs of pain that would typicallybe missed, and they have become a routine compo-nent of the monitoring of horses. 2In addition, a description of an equine \"pain face\" has an AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 115BACK TO BASICS: THE ACUTE ABDOMEN IN THE FIELD NOTESadditional level of subtlety when it comes to pain detection. This results from tensing of the muscu-lature along the muzzle and above the eye. 3 3. Initial Considerations Ever since dipyrone was initially taken off the mar-ket in 1977, most horse farms have flunixin meglu-mine readily available and it has become com-mon for trainers to administer non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for colic without consulting theveterinarian. This is not necessarily in compliancewith state veterinary practice acts. One approachis to ask the owner or trainer to at least call thepractice to let the veterinarian know before treatinga horse for colic so that treatment can be discussed.Owners and veterinarians need to be aware that afull dose of flunixin meglumine (1.1 mg/kg, IV) fortreatment of colic is a potent analgesic and hasduration of 8-12 hours. Use of flunixin meglumineat the currently recommended maximum dosage(1.1 mg/kg, q12h, IV) can make pain in horses thatare in true need of intensive care more difcult todetect. This issue of \"masking\" of colic signs byowner or trainer administration of analgesics con-tinues to be problematic, particularly when it delaysfurther treatment. Dipyrone was successful be-cause it was a mild analgesic and did not completelyameliorate pain in horses requiring surgery. In- terestingly, this medication has recently become available on the market again, although it is labeledfor treatment of pyrexia. 4 4. Initial Examination To shorten the time needed to examine a horse withcolic, consider asking your receptionist to get thesignalment, treatments given, effect of treatment,and duration of colic. Owners may be reluctantto admit to administering treatments, necessitatingsome skill in obtaining an accurate history. There-fore, it is important for the receptionist or the vet-erinarian to ask questions about administration ofmedications in a way that makes the owner feelcomfortable about providing an accurate answer.Additional history, such as diet, de-worming sched-ule, and housing can be obtained after the horse hasbeen attended to with some exceptions. For exam-ple, it is very helpful to know a horse's forage diet inthe Southeastern United States because of the prev-alence of ileal impaction associated with coastal Ber-muda hay. On physical examination, the veterinarian can make a more accurate determination of the level ofcolic (mild, moderate, or severe). This may requirehaving the horse in its normal environment such asa stall or paddock so the behavior is not inhibitedby being handled. The next step is to assess thecardiovascular status of the horse. This is done byassessing the color of the gums, obtaining a capillaryrell time, and taking the heart rate. It is prefer-able to take the pulse from the facial artery so thatan assessment of pulse quality (\"thready\" or strong)can be made. However, the horse sometimes makesthis difcult because it is in pain; at which timeauscultatation of the chest is appropriate. If thehorse is severely painful, obtaining the heart rate isimportant if possible because it has consistentlybeen shown to be the best prognostic indicator. 5 5. Initial Treatment of Pain If a horse is actively showing signs of colic, and oncethe cardiovascular status has been obtained, this isthe time to treat for pain. The author's choiceis xylazine (0.3 mg/kg; 150-200 mg) because it isshort-acting (approximately 40 minutes), highly ef-fective as an analgesic, and sedates the horse tofacilitate the remainder of the examination. 6A popular and effective addition to xylazine is butor-phanol (5 mg, IV). If the veterinarian chooses toTable 1. A Pain Scoring System Adapted to Detect Behavioral Signs of Pain That Can Be Used to Recognize Subtle Cases of Colic That May Initially Appear Normal.

Another med-ication that has become available is hyoscinebutylbromide a(0.3 mg/kg, slowly IV). This is an excellent anti-spasmodic agent, but the product sold in the United States does not contain an anal- gesic (this product sold in Europe, also containsdipyrone [metamizole] and is the favored choice forinitial treatment for colic in other countries). How-ever, hyoscine butylbromide acan be given with non- steroidal anti-inflammatory available in theUnited States. Concerns elevations inheart rate with hyoscine butylbromide a(approxi- mately 20 minutes) become of less concern if theveterinarian has already checked the heart rate andadministered an analgesic. If an initial dose of xy-lazine, particularly if administered with butorpha-nol, has no effect, the treatment can be repeated.However, it is important to realize that the necessityfor a second treatment with an analgesic raises theindex of suspicion that a horse needs referral. Ifpain continues, more potent sedatives such as deto-midine (0.01-0.02 mg/kg; 5-10 mg, IV) can be usedand can be repeated as needed if the horse remainspainful. If repeated doses of detomidine are inef-fective, the horse needs to be referred if at all pos- sible. For owners that do not wish to refer,inability to control pain is an important factor inmaking the decision to euthanize a horse. Alterna-tively, for horses that respond well to an initial doseof xylazine, following completion of the remainder ofthe examination, flunixin meglumine (1.1 mg/kg, IV)is helpful as an anti-inflammatory and longer dura-tion analgesic if it has not already been given.If colic does recur, the risk that surgery or intensivecare is needed is increased. Therefore, the owneror trainer should be given explicit instructions tokeep the horse in a stall, hold the horse off feed, andregularly monitor the horse for 24 hours for recur-rence of pain. It is also helpful to ask the owner toassess fecal output. Many horses that arrive atreferral hospitals after prolonged durations of colichave been treated on multiple occasions for colic,which can be improved upon if horses with the rstrecurrence of pain after analgesia are considered forreferral. Nonetheless, considerations of expense,owner preference, and shipping are widely under-stood to complicate decision making. 6. Remainder of the Physical Examination Once the horse is comfortable, the level of dehydra-tion can be determined by tenting the skin on theneck, and looking at the appearance of the eye in theorbit. This can be deceiving in senior horses be-cause of the loss of elasticity of the skin. Nonethe-less, most horses can be practically dened as notdehydrated (skin tent, 2-3 seconds), 6% dehydrated(3-6-second skin tent), 8% dehydrated (6-8 secondskin tent, some evidence of the eye sinking back intothe orbit), or 10% dehydrated (prolonged skin tent,obvious sinking of the eye). The next component ofthe examination is auscultation of the chest to con-rm heart rate (this may be affected by analpha-2 agonist such as xylazine) and to brieflyauscultate the Auscultation of the ab-domen at the paralumbar fossa as well as at a site onthe lower flank for approximately 1 minute on eachside is reasonable to classify gut sounds as absent,normal, or increased. Gut sounds may be reducedin response to alpha-2 agonists. The time requiredfor this part of the examination provides a goodopportunity to take the rectal temperature, and thisshould always be done prior to rectal palpation.A febrile horse with signs of colic is often associatedwith the early phases of enteritis or colitis, and somehorses with colitis have severe abdominal pain. Rectal palpation is a useful and practical means to determine the intestinal segment causing the causeof colic. Determining the position of the spleenis important. If it feels larger than normal, andpushed away from the body wall, the most frequentreason is that the colon is between the spleen andbody wall. Phenylephrine (0.01 mg/kg over 20 min-utes diluted in saline) and walking or jogging thehorse can be helpful to vasoconstrict the spleen tohelp resolve possible colonic displacement on the leftside of the abdomen. 7Another critical component of the colic examination is nasogastric intubation.When horses have severe pain or tachycardia, thestomach tube should be passed early during theexamination to relieve possible gastric distension. Diagnostic ultrasound is becoming a common diagnostic modality and can be adapted to use rap-idly in the eld using a fast localized abdominalsonography for horses examination. This takes ap-proximately 10 minutes to perform, and can be usedto detect such ndings as abdominal fluid, distendedsmall intestine, and the appearance of the nephro-splenic space. This is particularly useful in regionsof the abdomen beyond the reach of rectal palpationand can be used in conjunction with rectal palpationto provide as much information as possible in termsof localizing the cause of colic. 7. Laxative Treatment Laxatives should be administered via nasogastrictube, and only when there is no evidence of gastricreflux. Additionally, if the veterinarian suspects asmall intestinal obstruction, including ileal impac-tion, nasogastric laxatives or fluids are not indicatedbecause of a lack of transit to the region of theimpaction. If a horse is suspected of having a gas-tric impaction, multiple water lavages of the stom-ach are warranted. Although mineral oil (2 to 4L/500 kg PO) is commonly used as a laxative, it hasbeen shown that hydration of the colonic contentscan be better achieved by administration of magne-sium sulfate (1 g/kg in4Lo fwater PO). 8While sodium sulphate has been greatercolonic BASICS: THE ACUTE ABDOMEN IN THE FIELDphate, it also results in thirst and hypocalcemia, making magnesium sulphate preferable.8Access to feed should not be permitted but water should be freely available. For impactions that persist, ag-gressive enteral and/or intravenous fluid therapyshould be instituted. One study demonstrated theincreased efcacy of continuously administered en-teral rehydration solution in softening colonic con-tents as compared with intravenous fluids, whichare probably best suited to restoring the systemicextracellular fluid compartment. 9In another study, investigators determined that administration of8-10 L of isotonic enteral fluids every 2 hours inhorses with either large colon impaction or largecolon displacement successfully resolved impactionsin 99% of cases and in excess of 80% of large colondisplacements within 24-hours. The enteral fluidwas practically simple to make, usin g6gN a C la n d 3 g KCl/ L of tap water. made from water andelectrolytes. In some cases, a less aggressive ap-proach (5Lq2 - 4hours) is helpful to reduce impac-tions without causing colic or reflux associated withover-lling the stomach. If the impaction remainsunresolved, the horse becomes uncontrollably pain-ful, or extensive gas distention of the colon occurs,surgery is indicated. 8. Considerations for Fluid Therapy Intravenous fluid therapy is typically more practicalto reserve for referral hospitals because of the needfor frequent monitoring by a knowledgeable techni-cal staff. It is certainly possible to administer flu-ids in the eld, but the time taken to place a catheterand a therapeutic volume of fluids should be care-fully considered. Occasionally, catheter placementis also reasonable to enable horse owners to repeattreatment during shipping, particularly for a recur-rently painful horse that has a long shipping time.For IV fluid therapy, once the degree of dehydrationhas been estimated, the percentage is multiplied bythe horse's body weight to give the fluid decit (e.g.,6% dehydration /H11003500 kg /H1100530 L). In the eld, if fluids are going to be administered, the veterinarianshould be prepared to give approximately 15-20 L,which corresponds to half the fluid decit for anadult horse that is 6% to 8% dehydrated. Thisavoids any misconception by the owner that a smallvolume of fluids will make a difference. 9. Conclusions Important considerations for optimal treatment ofcolic in the eld are optimal use of available analge-sics based on their potency and duration of action, aswell as a knowledge of how well the horse can bemonitored by the owner. Other considerations arethe indicated usages of nasogastric laxatives, andthe place of rehydration therapy. Importantly,eld analgesia and fluid therapy are effective in thelarge majority of horses with colic. However, forthose horses with breakthrough pain, particularlyafter potent analgesics including alpha-2 agonists(xylazine and detomidine) and opiates (butorphanol)should be carefully considered for referral. Addi-tionally, management of pain but a lack of success atresolving conditions like large colon impactions over1-2 days should be also be considered for referral.

Introduction Referral of the horse with colic on an emergency basis is stressful for owners, caregivers and the vet-erinarians trying to do the best medically and nan-cially for the horse and owner. Encouraging clientsto have an emergency plan for their horse(s) and tobe prepared will contribute to a favorable outcome.An emergency preparedness checklist for horse own-ers and caregivers includes knowing the following: Contact information for owner, if caregiver Horses/foals for which referral is an option Horses/foals for which surgery is an option Financial outlay that can be made on a partic-ular horse/foal Referral hospital information (address, tele-phone number, directions) Insurance company information (companyname, telephone number, policy information) Pertinent medical history Breeding and foaling dates and other specicinformation for broodmares Referral can also occur on an elective basis. Whilereferral on an elective basis is generally less expen-sive, it should be reserved for patients with chronicintermittent or recurrent colic.Veterinarians should be familiar with the referral procedures at a particular hospital. Admission in- formation including client name, address, telephonenumber(s); horse name, age, breed, sex, and previ-ous admission; and insurance information should beprovided. Pertinent information to be provided directly to the attending veterinarian at the referral hospitalincludes the following: History\u2014Specic colic signs\u2014Duration of colic\u2014Previous status of mare\u2014Concurrent disease (co-morbidities)\u2014Current medication examination\u2014Severity of expectations and nancial constraints Preparation involves having a patient as stable aspossible upon arrival at the referral hospital and anowner/caregiver with appropriate expectations suchthat they can make decisions for their animal. 2. Patient Patient preparation includes providing adequate an-algesia for the trailer ride. If the horse is showingmild to moderate pain, xylazine with or withoutbutorphanol is usually adequate. However, in theseverely painful horse (e.g., large colon volvulus)detomidine may be necessary. Avoid using potentlong-lasting analgesic drugs (e.g., detomidine) inhorses that are only mild to moderately painful, especially if the trailer ride is short, because thismakes evaluation upon admission to the referralhospital difcult. Analgesic drugs can be providedfor the owner to administer to the horse duringtransportation, if necessary and if safe. Informa-tion pertaining to drug used, dose, route, and time ofadministration immediately before or during trans-portation should be provided to the attending veter-inarian at the referral hospital. If a horse has reflux following nasogastric intu- bation, or distended loops of rectum or ultrasonographic evalua- tion, re-checking for reflux immediately prior totransportation is imperative. It is also recom-mended to transport the horse with the nasogastrictube secured in place. While gastric rupture canoccur even with a nasogastric tube in place, it allowsfor decompression immediately upon arrival at thereferral hospital and if the end of the tube is leftunplugged then fluid under pressure can be ex-pelled. Taping a gloved nger over the end of thetube and cutting a hole in the tip provides a one-wayvalve whereby reflux can be expelled if gastric pres-sure builds up while avoiding aspiration of air intothe stomach. The tip of the nasogastric tube shouldbe nowhere near the patient's eye because it cancause mechan ical trauma or chemical injury can result from any expelled reflux. Rarely, horsescan aspirate with the nasogastric tube in place andwhile there is nothing specic to prevent this,awareness is important for early identication ofhorses developing aspiration pneumonia. Trocharization is generally not recommended prior to referral. While the procedure is safe whenthe appropriate technique is used, there is still therisk of developing peritonitis or intestinal injury.The only indication for trocharization prior to refer-ral is when the severity of abdominal distention issuch that the horse is unable to adequately ventilateand likely to go into respiratory arrest during transportation. Intravenous fluid therapy is generally not neces- sary prior to referral. The exception to this wouldbe a horse with a suspected small intestinal stran-gulating obstruction showing signs of shock and re-quiring a long trailer ride to the referral hospital.In most cases, the time taken to administer suf-cient fluids to stabilize the horse does not warrantthe delay in referral. It is not recommended toadminister fluids during transportation particularlyduring winter when the fluid in the bags can freeze. If it is anticipated that the horse may become recumbent during transportation, the dividers shouldbe taken out of the trailer and the horse's headeither not tied or tied loosely to facilitate getting thehorse off the trailer upon arrival. Horses withlarge colon volvulus, gastrointestinal rupture, andsevere colitis typically become recumbent duringtransportation. If possible, it can be useful to havethe owner/caregiver or transporter give the referral hospital a call when they are 15-30 minutes fromarrival in instances where travel exceeds an hour. 3. Client Preparation The owner should be given an overview of expecta-tions upon arrival at a referral hospital. Proce-dures and policies vary between hospitals andpractitioners should be at least somewhat familiarwith such information. Emergency clinicians havepreferences based on clinical experience and geo-graphical region regarding procedures and diagnos-tic tests. Many hospitals have referral packets thatcan be obtained to have on hand for clients whenemergency referral of their horse is necessary. In most hospitals, the client will need to register at the reception desk. The personnel will vary be-tween hospitals and may include interns/residents,emergency clinician or surgeon, nursing or technicalstaff, and veterinary students. Typically, a history will be taken by a veterinar- ian, student, or nu rse. A physical examination may be performed by multiple veterinarians (andstudents). Blood may be drawn from the jugularvein for laboratory data, a nasogastric tube passed,a jugular vein catheter placed and the horse admin-istered a bolus of intravenous fluids. Abdomino-centesis may be performed using a needle or teatcannula and it is important to recognize that insome cases peritoneal fluid is not obtained. Ab-dominal palpation per rectum and often transab-dominal ultrasonographic evaluation are performed.The client may or may not be able to be presentduring these procedures. The ndings will be dis-cussed with the owner and a treatment plan, whichwill involve the decision to manage the horse medi-cally or surgically, with associated expenses andprognosis explained. An estimated 40% to 50% ofhorses referred for colic require surgery and it isimportant to recognize that certain medical diseases 120 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: THE ACUTE ABDOMEN IN THE FIELD(e.g., colitis, enteritis) require intensive manage- ment with the associated expense. Clients should be aware of the approximate ex- pense associated with emergency (or elective) ad-mission, medical treatment, surgical treatment aswell as required deposits and payment requirementsor options. There are considerable regional varia-tions in expenses but some ranges of costs at UShospitals in 2020 are below: Emergency admission including including emergency basic postoperative care: US$6,000 to $10,000 A deposit of 50% of the upper or lower end ofthe estimate is generally required. While it is important that clients have reasonableexpectations regarding the expense associated withreferral of horses with colic, they should not be de-terred because often the components that make upthe \"standard of care\" can be modied. For exam-ple, a horse with a pelvic flexure impaction that didnot respond to initial treatment in the eld may notnecessarily require laboratory data or intravenouscatheterization. Enteral fluids are less expensiveand likely more benecial for resolving a pelvic flex-ure impaction than intravenous fluids. 1,2These considerations can substantially lower the expenseassociated with treatment. Client budgetary re-strictions and expectations should be communicatedwith the attending clinician at the referral hospitalso that every attempt can be made to provide thebest possible care for the patient within the client'snancial means. 4. When to Refer the Horse with Colic Colic requires emergency veterinary care and hors-es/foals that do not respond to initial treatment onthe farm should be referred on an emergency basis.Early referral and surgical intervention has proba-bly been the single most important factor contri-buting to the improvement in survival of horsesrequiring colic surgery. 3When horses/foals requir- ing surgery or intensive medical care are treatedearly, there is improved survival and fewer compli-cations such as shock, ischemia-reperfusion injury,postoperative reflux, adhesion formation, and lami-nitis. Fewer complications mean lower cost associ-ated with treatment. Often, very early exploratorysurgery of a horse with a small intestinal strangu-lating obstruction will mean that the lesion can becorrected without resection and anastomosis beingnecessary and the horse will have an excellent prog-nosis. 4Survival rates for colic surgery in the late 1980s and early 1990s for small intestinal strangu-lating lesions were as low as 30% to 50% 5,6whereas current survival rates of horses recovered from gen-eral anesthesia (i.e., not euthanized during to 95%. 7,8Similarly, vival horses approximately 25% to 60% to 70% from the late1980s to the late 1990s 9and was reported to be as high as 85% at one hospital.3,10While surgical technique and simply recovering the horse fromsurgery is likely to have played a role in some ofthese reports, 9early referral has been shown to be important.3,11 Early referral is particularly important for horses with strangulating intestinal lesions. Completeischemia for a period beyond 3 to 4 hours can lead to irreversible cell damage and tissue injury. Largecolon volvulus is often a peracute disease that canresult in irreversible colonic injury within a fewhours and death within several hours. While inmany cases of small intestinal strangulating ob-struction, resection of injured tissue is possible; there are some cases where resection is not possiblebecause of the location or extent of injury. More-over, prolonged distention of the intestine proximalto the strangulating serosal in-jury adhesion formation. 12,13 Early lesion correction also minimizes signs of shock. Shock can be associated with endotoxemia(systemic inflammatory response syndrome), hypo-volemia, and pain. S igns of shock worsen with a prolonged time between lesion occurrence andcorrection. Clinical and laboratory indices ofshock including tachycardia, high packed cell vol-ume (PCV), and hyperlactatemia are associatedwith prognosis for survival. 9,14-17 Education of horse owners with regard to the im- plication of delayed referral is necessary for success.Owners need to understand the importance of hav-ing their veterinarian examine a horse with colic.Presentation of information to the owner with re-gard to the referral process and associated expensewill influence their decision making. Informationshould be presented enthusiastically and positivelyyet realistic expectations provided. While the vast majority of horses with colic can be managed in the eld, approximately 10% to 20% willrequire referral to a hospital or surgical facility. 16,18 Referral does not necessarily mean that surgery isindicated but that closer monitoring, more thoroughdiagnostic tests, and/or intensive treatment with in-travenous fluids and analgesia is recommended.There are several factors that go into the decision torefer a horse with colic: Persistent, severe, or recurrent abdominal pain Shock AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 121BACK TO BASICS: THE ACUTE ABDOMEN IN THE FIELDTachycardia or increasing heart rate Nasogastric reflux, especially large volumes of reflux Evidence of complete intestinal obstruction orpoor motility Palpation per rectum ndings Pain The main indication for referral on an emergencybasis is severe or persistent signs of abdominal paindespite treatment with analgesics. As a guideline,if the horse is treated with a dose of flunixin meglu-mine, then requires a dose of sedation (xylazine andbutorphanol), and is persistently painful throughthis analgesic regimen, referral is indicated andshould be discussed with the owner. Causes of per-sistent signs of pain despite medical managementinclude strangulating intestinal obstruction, othercauses of intestinal ischemia, gas distention associ-ated with a complete mechanical obstruction, oran inflammatory process. Often a horse is not par-ticularly painful or is temporarily responsive toanalgesics, and other guidelines for referral are nec-essary. Examples of causes of colic that may havesuch a response include large colon and cecal impac-tions and colonic displacements. Individual vari-ability in pain tolerance between horses exists.Geriatric horses and draft breeds tend to be lessdemonstrative of colic pain compared to other horsesand this should always be considered. If referralis not an option, euthanasia is indicated in horseswith severe pain that is unresponsive to analgesia(e.g., flunixin meglumine and multiple doses ofdetomidine). Chronic or recurrent abdominal pain is also an indication for referral, although often these horsesdo not necessarily need to be referred on an emer-gency basis. The purpose of referring these horses is predominantly for further diagnostic evaluation in-cluding radiographic and ultrasonographic evaluation,abdominocentesis and peritoneal fluid analysis,clinical laboratory data, gastroscopy, and explor-atory celiotomy in some instances. Owners should be aware, however, that often the evaluation of thehorse with chronic colic is unrewarding. Examples of lesions that may cause such clinical signs includeenterolithiasis, intermittent nephrosplenic entrap-ment of the large colon, gastric ulceration, inflamma-tory bowel disease, sand enteropathy, neoplasia, andadhesions. Shock Shock is dened as inadequate oxygen delivery tothe cells leading to insufcient adenosine triphos-phate (ATP) production and ultimately cell death.Hypovolemia, endotoxemia (systemic inflammatoryresponse syndrome), sepsis, and hemorrhage canlead to shock in the horse showing signs of colic.Signs of shock include tachycardia (heart rate /H1102270 beats/minute), injected or toxic mucous membranes,prolonged capillary rell time, poor jugular vein re-ll time, cool extremities, and dull demeanor. Re-ferral of horses with shock is recommended becauseof the need of intravenous fluid therapy and thelikelihood that they have serious disease. Shock,by denition, leads to anaerobic metabolism andlactate production. Point-of-care lactate metersmay be useful for assessing and monitoring horsesin the eld. Horses with gastrointestinal perfora-tion rapidly develop signs of shock including profusesweating, muscle fasciculations, tachycardia, tachy-pnea with nostril flare, and injected or toxic mucousmembranes. Horses with perforation often have agrimace and are reluctant to walk and develop afever. Perforation can be conrmed with transab-dominal ultrasonographic evaluation combined with abdominocentesis and peritoneal fluid analy- sis. Euthanasia is indicated in any horse with con-rmed perforation. Tachycardia or Increasing Heart Rate When treated on the farm, horses should be moni-tored closely for tachycardia or increasing heartrate. A particularly high heart rate /H1102260 beats/min- ute or a heart rate that is increasing despite medicalmanagement is an indication for referral becauseit suggests worsening of a condition and failure torespond to medical management. The main causesof tachycardia include shock and pain. Any horsewith a heart rate /H1102260 beats/minute is likely to have some signs of either severe pain or shock indicativeof a referral. Nasogastric Reflux The horses with large volumes of nasogastric refluxshould be referred because this is often an indicationof either proximal enteritis or a small intestinalstrangulating obstruction requiring surgery. Evenif surgery is not necessary (i.e., proximal enteritis orileus) intravenous fluids are recommended. Evidence of Complete Intestinal Obstruction or Poor Motility There are several clinical indications that the horse likely has a complete intestinal obstruction or isnot responding to initial treatment with analgesiaand/or enteral fluids and mineral oil: marked orincreasing abdominal distention; absent, reduced ordeteriorating borborygmi; and absent fecal outputdespite treatment. Of particular note is the associ-ation between lack of intestinal borborygmi and theneed for colic surgery. 19 Abdominal Palpation Per Rectum While not necessarily an overriding clinical feature,ndings on palpation per rectum that are indica-tions for the following: Cecal impaction: Horses with cecal impactionhave a relatively high risk of cecal perforationthat can be insidious. Signs of pain in horseswith a cecal impaction often respond well al- 122 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: THE ACUTE ABDOMEN IN THE FIELDbeit temporarily to treatment with flunixin meglumine. Small colon impaction: Impactions of thesmall colon require aggressive medical man-agement including intravenous and enteralfluids because they can be challenging to re-solve medically and often require a lot of anal-gesia, trocharization, and/or surgery. Horseswith small colon impactions right dorsal ligament entrap-ment): Similar to small thesehorses often require frequent analgesia, maybenet from intravenous fluids, and often re-quire surgery. Horses with nephrosplenicentrapment may respond to intravenousphenylephrine administration and/or rollingunder general anesthesia. 20-22Of note is that horses with nephrosplenic en-trapment often have another lesion. 20,21 Severe colonic distention: Large colon volvu-lus or a complete large or small colon obstruc-tion leads to severe colonic distention. Largecolon volvulus requires immediate surgical treatment. Horses with a com plete obstruc- tion (e.g., enterolithiasis or sand impaction)also require surgery. small intestine: Differentiatinga small intestinal strangulating from a non-strangulating obstruction often can be chal- lenging and, therefore, referral is recommendedfor any horse with small intestinal distention. Abdominal mass(es) often require a thoroughworkup including ultrasonographic evalua-tion, peritoneal fluid biopsy, and lap-aroscopy or cecal distention pelvic flexure/left ventral colon impaction alone are generally notindications for referral unless the referral hospital isseveral hours away and w arrants careful patient monitoring for resolution or deterioration. Find- ings on palpation per rectum, however, were notnecessarily associated with the need for surgery. 19 Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of Veteri- nary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Introduction It is critical for the client to develop an understand- ing of the short-term and long-term complicationsthat may affect a horse that has just been throughcolic surgery in order to optimize management.An understanding of the owner's expectation for re-turn to performance is also crucial. For example, ifthe expectation is to save the horse's life, this makessome complications such as incisional hernias a lesspressing concern, and even low-level chronic lamin-itis can be managed. However, these same compli-cations are highly problematic and impede long-term success in horses intended to return to athleticperformance. These factors can be discussed withthe owner in the immediate post-operative period. 2. Referral Time The greatest opportunity for maximizing successand reducing complications is at the time of referral,meaning that horses referred early in the disease process will likely have less intestinal injury, fasterand less intricate surgeries, and a more rapid recoveryin the post-operative period. The universal problemmost colic surgeons have to deal with is duration ofcolic. Studies have shown that even the most fatalforms of colic, such as large colon volvulus, can have aremarkably positive long-term outcome if they are re-ferred rapidly. 1The aforementioned study is from a referral area that is unique in the Unites States (Lex-ington, KY), in that the value of the horses, the qualityof the management, and the proximity to the referralhospital appears to reduce referral time down to aminimum. In other studies, the prognosis for largecolon volvulus is notably lower, largely because of re-ferral time. 2Therefore, equine veterinarians have to continue to work on early referral with their clients toimprove long-term results. Because the current stateof colic surgical management is rapid, technically pro-cient, and highly successful, the short-term survivalrate (discharge from the hospital) is progressively in-creasing into the range of 75% or above, even withsevere conditions like small intestinal strangulatingobstruction. 3However, long-term survival continues to be more problematic, particularly in horses recover-ing from small intestinal surgery, because of compli-cations such as adhesions. 3. Colic Surgery To understand long-term management of horses fol-lowing colic surgery, some understanding of whattranspires within surgery is important. Once a 124 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: THE ACUTE ABDOMEN IN THE FIELD NOTEShorse has been referred, time is again of the essence to decide on whether or not a horse should go to surgery in order to improve long-term outcome.Once in surgery, the surgical team should be able tomove swiftly through an exploratory and any surgi-cal manipulations required within 2-3 hours. Thisshould aim to maximally reduce time in the abdo-men, which translates to trauma, systemic inflam-mation, and a poorer long-term outcome. Of allof the long-term complications hindering a goodlong-term outcome, adhesions are among the mostproblematic. These result both from the level ofintestinal injury induced by the obstructive diseaseprocess and the level of manipulation at surgery.Another aspect of colic surgery that is critical tolong-term outcome is closure of the incision. Thatis because in one study, one of the factors that lim-ited long-term outcome to the greatest extent wasabdominal hernias. 4These likely relate to closure technique and whether or not the incision becomesinfected. Infection rates tend to be up to/H1101120% atmost surgical hospitals, 5but should be monitored closely to make sure the prevalence is not increas-ing. An additional factor that likely has a role inincisional complications is trauma to the incisionitself, which also relates to time and technical pro-ciency of the surgical team. 4. Post-Operative Complications The initial objective following surgery is a satisfac-tory recovery from anesthesia. Although cata-strophic injuries during anesthetic recovery, parti-cularly fractures, have become more uncommonwith advances in anesthetic techniques, nonethe-less, colic patients that present with systemic com-promise are at increased risk of complications,particularly following a long surgery for proceduressuch as a resection. Beyond anesthetic recovery,there are three major life-threatening complicationsof colic surgery that should be discussed with own-ers. First, assuming the horse recovers well fromanesthesia, there is management of shock states(hypovolemia and endotoxemia [sepsis or systemicinflammatory response syndrome]). judi-cious use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs), use of pain medications to optimize recov-ery, 6and use of colloids or plasma as needed to maintain oncotic pressure. Medications to speci-cally target endotoxemia, such as polymyxin B(5,000 u/Kg, IV), 7may be helpful, but remain largely unproven by clinical trials.8The next phase of post-operative management tends to be post-opera-tive ileus (POI). There is reasonably good evidencethat early return to feeding reduces POI. 9Aside from this principal, for horses that do develop POI,current treatment includes continued use of anti-inflammatory drugs and intravenous (IV) lido-caine. 10Studies have shown that COX-2 inhibitors may be more benecial than non-selective NSAIDsbecause they are capable of managing pain withoutinhibiting intestinal repair. 11,12Interestingly, con- current use of IV lidocaine (1.3 mg/kg loading dose,0.05 mg/mL controlled rate infusion [CRI]) also im-proves intestinal repair. 13There has also been one clinical trial showing that IV lidocaine reduced thelength of time of POI and amount of reflux, 14but more rigorous clinical trials are needed to discernthe utility of IV lidocaine. The latter phase of post-operative management in the hospital tends to re-late to adhesion formation, particularly in patientstreated for small intestinal obstruction. Develop- ment of adhesions are thought to be clinically evident based on recurrent episodes of colic in at-risk pa-tients. 15One intra-operative treatment that is be- lieved to reduce onset of adhesions, based in areduction in incidence of post-operative colic in pa-tients following small intestinal surgery, is car-boxymethylcellulose, 15which can be used during surgery and following lavage of the abdomen withsterile saline in volumes of 500 mL to 1 L. In ad-dition, post-operative peritoneal lavage and drain-age has been found to mitigate adhesion formationin an experimental setting, 16and can be used clini- cally by infusing /H1101110 L balanced polyionic fluids into an abdominal drain, and retrieving these fluidsafter allowing approximately 20 minutes of timewithin the abdomen. There are also other post-operative complications that occur less frequently, including laminitis, whichcan be devastating. A relatively recent advance intreatment of laminitis has been the use of digitalcryotherapy (continuous icing of the feet) in anyhorse at risk of laminitis, 17and this may improve long-term results. Importantly, a great deal of at-tention should also be paid to the midline incision.Incisional infection remains a relatively commonpost-operative complication, and in some cases isassociated with hernia formation. Incisional infec-tions are resolved by early removal of skin staples orsutures to allow for drainage, and lavage of theincision. Horses may continue to have clinical evi-dence of an incisional infection at the time of dis-charge, which will need to be attended to by thereferring veterinarian. The incision will need to becarefully probed to determine the extent of infection,including whether or not the sutures within thelinea alba are prematurely breaking down. If thereis a concern that a hernia may develop, commercialhernia belts are recommended to reduce tension onthe linea alba. Once a hernia has formed, it can bemonitored ultrasonographically and decisions canbe made as to whether to ultimately perform herni-orrhaphy. Unfortunately, the best time to takethese horses back to surgery is after the incision hashealed to the greatest extent possible, forming asufcient thickness of brous tissue to optimizethe repair, at approximately 6 months following sur-gery. This can be very difcult for owners to un-derstand, and can require a lot of additionalcommunication between the veterinarian, surgeon,and owner. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 125BACK TO BASICS: THE ACUTE ABDOMEN IN THE FIELD5. What is the Expectation for Long-Term Outcome? An understanding of the owner's expectations can make a big difference in how to dene long-termoutcome. For example, if the expectation is solelyto save the horse's life, then considerations overincisional hernias or other long-term managementproblems such as laminitis can be more readily rec- onciled within the owner's expectations. Long-term analyses based on the type of lesion a horse has had can also be discussed to make sure expectationsare realistic. For example, once a horse has beendischarged from the hospital, the long-term progno-sis is lower for horses with small intestinal stran- gulation obstruction as compared to other forms ofobstruction. 18The principal reason for this ap - pears to be recurrent colic, most likely associated with adhesions.19When advising owners, it is helpful for them to know that if a horse is going tohave problems with adhesions, it is typically within3 months of surgery. Unfortunately, colic that re-quires a second surgery because of adhesions carriesa fair-to-guarded prognosis. If owners expect a return to athletic performance, management of long-term complications becomesthat much more critical, and complications such asincisional hernia may require an additional surgeryto enable athletic performance. Other surgical in-terventions that can potentially be performed to re-duce repeat colic that might require surgery areablation of the nephrosplenic space in horses withrepeat episodes of left dorsal displacement, and col-opexy in horses with repeat episodes of large colonvolvulus. The latter tends to preclude athletic per-formance because of colic associated with adhesionof the colon to the ventral body wall, but is particu-larly useful in broodmares that are at greatest riskof large colon volvulus. Resection of the colon is analternative consideration to colopexy, allowing re-turn to athletic performance. Larger studies to im-prove understanding of long-term outcome areneeded, and beginning to be performed. 6. Helping Owners Return Their Horse to Performance Return to intended use and performance following colic surgery is of major concern to horse owners.The potential for return to performance in an equineathlete is typically weighed against the cost of sur-gery, intensive post-operative care, and prolongedconvalescence. In one published study on return toperformance following colic surgery, 76% of horsesdischarged from the hospital had at least reachedtheir pre-operative level of performance within 1year. 4Another study on Thoroughbred racehorses showed that 69% of horses taken to surgery for colicreturned to racing within 6 months. 20This illus- trates how long it can take to fully rehabilitate ahorse following colic surgery. Current recommen-dations are to stall rest horses following dischargefrom the hospital for colic surgery for 1 month, fol-lowed by 1 month of small paddock turnout, and agradual return to exercise in the third month follow-ing colic surgery. This time frame approximatelyparallels the healing of the midline incision, whichwill have reached original strength in 8 weeks in theabsence of any complications such as infection orrepeat laparotomy. 21From this perspective own - ers can expect to be riding their horses at a reducedbut escalating level after 2 months, with most sporthorses attaining full athletic potential w ithin 12 months, depending upon the discipline and extentof surgery. 4However, more recent studies on re - habilitation of horses with midline incisions suggestthat practitioners could be advising clients differ-ently in order to return to performance more rapidly.In particular, a recent study showed that havingclients work with their horses in a controlled fashionin the post-operative period to reduce loss of mus-cle strength reduced the time to return to fullperformance, and resulted in more horses attain-ing a higher level of performance following colicsurgery. 22 7. Conclusions Preparing a client for the post-operative period fol-lowing colic surgery includes an understanding ofshort- and long-term complications. Once a horsehas been discharged, the veterinarian should havethe client focus on any instances of recurrent colicand the appearance of the incision. A good workingknowledge of post-operative complications that oc-curred during hospitalization is important to be ableto guide the client following hospital discharge.Finally, the post-operative exercise program should be carefully controlled to allow time for the midlineincision to heal, but can be modied to reduce loss ofmuscle tone in order to increase the chances of ear-lier return to performance. Attention to feeding foroptimal retention and strengthening of muscle massis also an important component of post-operativerehabilitation.

Introduction Transport of cooled stallion semen is commonly per- formed with one extender based on native phospho-caseinate (NP) a; although this is an excellent extender, some stallions still do not cool well withthis extender. The objective of this study was tocompare the most widely used semen extenderbased on NP awith a new extender based on sodium caseinate (SC) associated with cholesterol-loaded cy-clodextrin band also three semen cooling containers by assessing semen parameters and embryo recov-ery rates of cooled stallion semen. The authors hy-pothesized that the combination of cholesterol andsodium casein results in superior parameters forcooled stallion semen than NP. 2. Materials and Methods In experiment 1, 45 ejaculates from 9 mature stal-lions were collected, assessed, and equally split be-tween both extenders and then extended to 50 million sperm/mL. Then, the extended semen wasstored in three passive cooling containers c,d,efor 48 h. In experiment 2, the same ejaculates ex-tended in experiment 1 were centrifuged, the super- natant was discarded, and the pellets wereresuspended at 100 million sperm/mL with theirrespective extenders. Semen was then cooled andstored as in experiment 1. In both experiments,sperm motility parameters were assessed at 0, 24,and 48 h post-cooling. Plasma membrane integrityand high mitochondrial membrane potential wereassessed with spectral flow cytometry fusing a x- able staining with Zombie Greengand Mitotracker Deep Red.hFor experiment 3, 12 mares (n /H1100524 cycles) were randomly bred with 48-h cooled semenfrom 1 stallion used in the previous experiments andavailable to the investigators. Semen was pro-cessed as described in experiment 1.

Data were analyzed with mixed models. 3. Results and Discussion In experiment 1, SC displayed superior total andprogressive motility relative to NP ( P/H11021 0.05). There were no signicant differences be-tween the type of containers in any experiment.In experiment 2, NP and SC extenders had similartotal and progressive motility, but SC had superiorsperm velocity parameters at all timepoints. Em-bryo recovery was identical for both extenders(50%). Finally, the results obtained herein suggestthat SC is a suitable alternative to be included insemen cooling tests against NP in clinical practice.

Authors' addresses: Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, University of Florida,Gainesville, FL 32610 2020AAEP. Uterine lavage as early as 4 hours post-uterine insemination removes inflammatory products. Theauthors hypothesize that by using deep horn insem-ination (DHAI), mares could be lavaged earlier thanpreviously thought without affecting the pregnancyrates. 2. Materials and Methods Mares were randomly allocated to two groups (group1 lavaged 1 hour and group 2 lavaged 4 hours post-DHAI) and bred over 14 cycles with frozen semen ina cross-over design. A total of 1 mg deslorelin wasgiven intramuscularly, and mares were bred within6 hours post-ovulation. A Student t-test deter-mined differences between groups. In a commer-cial setting, 192 normal or subfertile mares bred byDHAI within 4 hours post-ovulation were not la- vaged or were lavaged at 1 or 4 hours post-DHAI.Chi-square was used to determine the signicance of the treatments on pregnancy rates. 3. Results Overall, the pregnancy rate in experiment 1 was 42.8% with no difference ( P/H110210.28) in pregnancy rates between groups. Subfertile mares in the com-mercial setting that were lavaged at 1 hour or 4hours had a higher pregnancy rate (48.4% vs.42.86%) than those not lavaged (33.3%) (P /H110210.05). 4. Discussion The results from the timed uterine lavage especiallyin problem mares indicate that early lavage can bebenecial when mares are bred by DHAI, perhapsby reducing the length of uterine-sperm contact andtherefore reducing the time in which the mare canmount a full uterine inflammatory reaction. 130 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHERIOGENOLOGY Research Abstract /L50093for more information, contact the corresponding author NOTESAcknowledgments The Authors are grateful to the staff at Reproduc- tion Specialty practice and at JCS Veterinary Repro-ductive Services for their help.

Introduction Assessment of pregnancy viability in the equine pa- tient is currently based on gestational proles oflimited prognostic value. In recent years, Dopplertechnology has been applied to uterine and umbilicalarteries of pregnant mares to monitor fetal res-ponsive hemodynamics, suggestive of com promise. To date, uterine artery Doppler indices failed toprovide sufcient evidence of pregnancy viability and the umbilical cord of the equine fetus is incon-sistently visualized past 250 days gestation. Theobjectives of this study were to 1) evaluate intracra-nial blood flow impedance of the fetal carotid artery,and 2) establish reference values for healthy, un-complicated pregnancies. 2. Materials and Methods For the purpose of this study, 12 pregnant mareswere examined at 2 to 3 weeks interval by B modeand Doppler ultrasonography and a n ovel tech- nique was for Doppler evaluation of thecarotid artery in the equine fetus. Additional bio- physical and biochemical parameters were collectedto demonstrate appropriate pregnancy development. 3.

Introduction The mare is unique among domestic animals in hav- ing a short interval from parturition to rst ovula-tion. 1The \"foal heat\" is dened as the estrus that occurs within the rst 20 days after foaling.2-4 Behavioral estrus usually begins 5 to 12 days afterfoaling, while the average day of ovulation is 10 to13 days postpartum, with a range of 7 to 20days. 1,3,5-9It is estimated that 85% to 95% of mares ovulate within the rst 20 days afterfoaling. 3,6,10 The gestation length in the h orse is approxi- mately 340 days and the interval from foaling topregnancy for mares initially bred on their foalheat is approximately 25 days. 1,3,11Conse- quently, in order to maintain a 12-month foalinginterval and produce on average a foal per year,mare owners need to consider foal-heat breedingoptions. The seasonal pregnancy rate for maresbred on the foal heat has been reported to becomparable to that of mares bred on later heatcycles, indicating that there is no disadvantage inconsidering a foal-heat breeding. 3Breeding mares on the foal heat was noted to increase theodds of foaling mares conceiving by the end of the season by a factor of 2.04 compared to mares notbred at the foal heat. 12Routinely waiting until the second (30-day) heat to begin breeding will inevitably result in a longer foaling-to-conception interval and an annual grad-ual drift toward a foaling date later in the season.A retrospective study in Thoroughbreds revealedthat 69% of mares foaling on consecutive yearsdrifted an average of 13 /H1100623 days later in the subsequent year. 13Owners that choose not to breed mares on the foal heat must accept the factthat mares will have to be left open for a seasonevery 3 to 6 years when the potential foaling datebecomes too late in the season to be acceptable. 2. Pregnancy and Pregnancy Loss Rates Pregnancy rates for mares bred at the foal heat havebeen noted to be lower and pregnancy loss rateshigher than for mares bred on a subsequent heat ina majority of reports (Table 1 and Table 2). 3,4,14-23 In contrast, some studies did not note any differencein pregnancy between foal-heat breeding and subse-quent cycles. 24-28 Pregnancy rates have been reported to be higher for mares bred on the foal heat if ovulation occurredafter day 10 than mares that ovulated on or beforeday 10 in some studies, 3,29but not in oth- ers.4Blanchard and coworkers22noted an in- creased odds ratio for pregnancy loss in maresbred before day 13 postpartum. Meyers and col- 138 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHERIOGENOLOGY NOTESleagues30reported that mares bred on the foal heat were 1.9 times more likely to experience pregnancy loss than mares bred on a later heat. Embryo lossafter a foal-heat breeding was reported to be de-creased in mares with lower stress than in maresexposed to higher levels of stress. 31The degree of stress was modulated by either maintaining maresocial groups or frequently modifying social groups. A current recommendation in clinical practice is to not breed foal-heat mares before the tenth day postfoaling; if a mare does ovulate prior to day 10, it isrecommended to administer prostaglandins 5 to 6days post ovulation to short cycle and breed on thesubsequent heat. 32-34 Mare age also has a signicant effect on fertility in post-partum mares, with mares greater than 14 to16 years of age having a lower foal-heat pregnancyrate than younger mares. 7,12,27 In most breeding programs, foaling mares consti- tute more than 50% of the population.1Manage- ment plans for rebreeding the post-partum mare arebased on owner goals, presence or absence of foalingor post-partum complications, ovarian function inthe post-partum period, stallion availability, andother factors. The goal of this review is to discussphysiologic events and management options for re-breeding the post-partum mare. 3. Considerations for Foal-Heat Breeding Dystocia occurs in approximately 4% to 11% of equine births.11,35,36The average duration of stageII of labor is approximately 17 minutes with most foals delivered within 20 to 30 minutes after ruptureof the chorioallantoic membrane. 36,37Prolonged la- bor, severe bruising, lacerations or hematomas ofthe reproductive tract during spontaneous delivery,trauma secondary to dystocia or obstetrical manip-ulation, and hemorrhagic episodes can all adverselyaffect uterine involution, fertility or breeding deci-sions in the early post-partum period. 38-40It is important to perform a thorough reproductive exam-ination on all foaling mares by 7 to 8 days post- partum, including examination of the externalgenitalia, vaginal speculum examination, manualdigital examination of the vagina and cervix, as wellas transrectal palpation and ultrasound. 33 Retained Fetal Membranes Expulsion of the fetal membranes (chorioallantois,amnion, and umbilical cord) usually occurs within30 minutes to 2 hours after foaling. In the mare, a\"placenta\" is considered to be abnormally retainedbeyond 3 hours postfoaling. 38,41Retention of the fetal membranes is more common after dystocia,abortion, prolonged gestation, induction of labor andobstetrical procedures, and the overall incidencerate is 2% to 10% in the general horse population. 38 Retained placenta may predispose mares to sys-temic diseases such as metritis and laminitis, aswell as adversely affect fertility in the early post-partum period. 42Retention of the fetal membranes longer than 3 hours may result in decreased preg-nancy rates in mares bred at the foal heat.

Consequently,it is recommended that early prompt treatment beinitiated to remove retained fetal membranes bothfor the health of the mare and to optimize her repro-ductive potential. 43,44 Excessive Lochia The term, lochia, refers to placental fluid, inflamma-tory cells, and debris remaining in the uterus afterfoaling. Mares normally pass a small amount ofturbid red-brown non-malodorous lochia fluid forseveral days after foaling. A small amount of fluidmay be observed in the uterine lumen during ultra-sound examination for the rst 3 to 6 days afterfoaling, after which the fluid volume should reducesignicantly. 9,38The presence of a small volume uterine fluid during the rst post-partum estrus wasnot associated with a reduction in pregnancy rate intwo studies. 45,46 There is no clinical need to treat a mare for the presence of a normal amount of lochia dischargeearly in the post-partum period. However, a pro-longed duration of lochial discharge, an abnormalodor or character to the discharge, or an increasedvolume or echogenicity of lochia within the uterusvisible on ultrasound examination beyond 5 to 7days after foaling are all abnormal and may de-crease fertility or increase embryonic loss in theearly post-partum period. 6,27,47-49In these circum- stances, a therapeutic uterine lavage along with ad-ministration of oxytocin should be considered. 46 Exercise may also be helpful for uterine involutionand evacuation of uterine fluid in post-partummares. 33,50-52 Uterine Involution The term, \"involution\", has been used to describe therestoration of the uterus to a pre-gravid state, andincludes expulsion of uterine fluid and debris, a re-duction in uterine size, and regeneration of the en-dometrial lining of the uterus. 51,52In a study evaluating uterine involution, biopsy of the uterusthe day after foaling revealed distinct microcar-uncles, distended endometrial glands and markededema. 53Re-evaluation 7 days after foaling showed that microcaruncles were no longer present,the luminal epithelium was intact, and the endome-trial glands were no longer distended, indicatingthat uterine involution was complete. The previously gravid horn remains larger than the contralateral horn for approximately 3 weeksafter foaling. 9,47Histologically, the endometrium returns to normal by 14 days postfoaling.8,53The endometrium of the mare sustains only limited dam-age as a consequence of pregnancy, foaling, and pas-sage of the placenta. This has been attributed tothe non-invasive diffuse epitheliochorial placenta-tion of the horse. 54Culture and Cytology Culture of the uterus of post-partum mares com-monly results in growth of Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus and/or Escherichia coli. 5,6,53,55-57 In some reports, a decrease in foal-heat pregnancyrate was noted in mares with a positive uterineculture, 56,58whereas other studies did not note a difference in pregnancy rates based on the presenceor absence of bacterial growth. 5,6Mares with a positive culture on their foal heat typically have anegative culture on the subsequent heat. 55,57Ulti- mately, there is no clear relationship between re-sults of culture and pregnancy rates in mares bredon the foal heat. Post-partum mares also exhibit considerable vari- ability in the amount of inflammation present in theuterus as determined by the number of inflamma-tory cells in cytologic samples. 5,6,24,59The number of neutrophils in uterine cytology samples was re-ported to increase from day 2 postpartum to day 5,but pregnancy rates after foal-heat breeding werenot different between mares with neutrophils andmares without neutrophils on uterine swabs. 5A second study noted that the number of neutrophilsand amount of cellular necrosis decreased from par-turition to the onset of the foal heat. 24A third study revealed that 58% of post-partum mares had asignicant degree of inflammation present at day 7and yet 73% of mares with signicant inflammationbecame pregnant after a foal-heat breeding. 6In summary, there is not a clear relationship betweenthe presence or absence of inflammatory cells in asample collected during the foal heat and the poten-tial for generating a pregnancy at a foal-heatbreeding. The post-partum period is the only period in the life of a mare in which the presence of bacteria (i.e.,Streptococcus sp. and E. coli) on culture and white blood cells on cytology may have limited clinicalrelevance. If a stallion owner requires a \"clean cul-ture\" prior to a live cover, it is anticipated that manyfoal-heat mares will be disqualied. If present, thebacteria and inflammation will usually be elimi-nated during and/or after the foal heat and a subse-quent culture should be negative and cytology cleanon the 30-day heat. The author's current recommendation is that de- cisions regarding foal-heat breeding should not bebased solely on endometrial cytology or culture sam-ples collected early in the post-partum period. Cervical Function Speculum examination of the vagina early in thepost-partum period may reveal a reddened or hyper-emic cervix, and a cloudy discharge. The cervix of apost-partum mare remains relaxed and open untilafter the rst ovulation, whether that is on the foalheat or a subsequent heat. 9Closure of the cervix is due to an elevation in serum progesterone levelsthat occurs after the rst post-partum ovulation. 52 Lacerations or bruising of the vulva, vestibule, 140 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHERIOGENOLOGYvagina, and/or cervix are relatively common in the post-partum mare and may be a reason to pass on afoal-heat breeding. 33 Ovarian Function Ovarian follicular development is usually present inmares during late pregnancy and mares may havesmall (10 to 15 mm) to medium-sized (20 to 25 mm)follicles the day of foaling. Reproductive functionin the post-partum mare follows 1 of 3 generalscenarios: Development of a large follicle, with associatedbehavioral estrus and uterine edema, and ovu-lation in foal-heat followed by ovu-lations at normal 21-day intervals; A foal-heat ovulation followed by a regressioninto anestrus before eventual resumption offollicular activity; Limited to no follicular development in thepost-partum period, with eventual initiation offollicular activity and ovulation. Post-partum anestrus is a term used to describemares in the latter 2 scenarios. Affected maresmay remain anestrus for weeks or months beforecyclic ovarian activity is initiated. A majority ofmares that experience post-partum anestrus willresume cycling in the late spring (i.e., April or Mayin the Northern Hemisphere). It has been reportedthat up to 27% of foaling mares exhibit a delay inreproductive function in the post-partum period, de-pendent on the time of year. 8Fortunately, a ma- jority of mares have a true foal-heat ovulation andcontinue to cycle if they are not bred or do notbecome pregnant at a foal-heat breeding. One ad-vantage of breeding mares on their foal heat is thatmares that do become pregnant are not at risk ofpost-partum anestrus. 51 Potential causes for post-partum anestrus include lactation, and nutri-tion/body theprimary culprit responsible for post-partum anestrusin mares. 1A majority of mares that exhibit post- partum anestrus are mares that foal out early in theyear, prior to the vernal equinox. 10Post-partum anestrus is much less common for mares that foal outafter the vernal equinox. Maintaining pregnantmares due to foal in the winter under a stimulatoryarticial photoperiod for at least the last 2 months ofgestation will decrease the probability of post-partumanestrus. 60-62The duration of articial photoperiod exposure prior to foaling was noted to be inverselyproportional to the percentage of mares that experi-enced post-partum anestrus. 62 Additional consequences of housing pregnant mares under lights include a decreased duration ofpregnancy observed by some authors, 62,63but not by others,61,62a shorter foaling-to-ovulation inter- val,60,61and a lower average duration of open days post foaling.61Lactation and nursing have a suppressive effect on reproductive function in some domestic animalspecies, most notably cats, pigs, and beef cows.Once the offspring are weaned in those species,ovarian function resumes. Lactation is consideredto have a less dramatic effect on reproductive func-tion in mares. However, anecdotal reports havesuggested that some mares that failed to developfollicles in the post-partum period or becomeanestrus following a foal-heat ovulation exhibitrapid follicular development and come into estrus assoon as the foal is weaned. Restrictive sucklingwas reported to be associated with an earlier rstovulation in the post-partum period than controlmares without restrictive suckling. 64However, short-term foal removal for 24 hours on day 3 to 4postpartum did not affect the interval from foalingto rst estrus or ovulation. 65 Inadequate nutrition and poor body condition in late gestation and the early post-partum periodmay also contribute to poor reproductive perfor-mance. 10,62,66,67The effects of inadequate nutri- tion and poor body condition may be manifested indelayed return to reproductive cyclicity postpartum,reduced pregnancy rates, and increased embryo lossrates. In addition, failure to exhibit behavioral signs of estrus (i.e., \"silent heat\") is more common in thefoal-heat period than in mares that have not re-cently given birth. 10,68Mares with a young foal at side are very protective and may not show behav-ioral estrus to a stallion. A combination of ultra-sound examinations and \"adjusted\" teasingtechniques may be needed to monitor reproductivefunction in breeding programs that utilize or requirelive cover mating. A safe and effective teasingtechnique for a mare with a young foal may need toinclude manual restraint of both the foal and mare. 4. Maximizing Foal-Heat Breeding Success Qualications In the author's opinion, post-partum mares \"qualify\" for consideration of a foal-heat breeding under thefollowing conditions: Normal foaling (i.e., no dystocia) No trauma to the reproductive tract No prolonged retained placenta No prolonged discharge of uterine fluid (lochia) No increased volume or echogenicity of fluidvisible within the uterine lumen on transrectalultrasound by day 7 to 10 Ovulation does not occur prior to day 10 postfoaling Mare is not of an advanced age (i.e., not /H1135015 years old) Potential Therapeutic Options Several therapeutic strategies have been used in anattempt to enhance fertility of mares in the early AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 141THERIOGENOLOGYpost-partum period. Administration of 150 to 300 mg of progesterone with or without addition of 10 to20 mg of estradiol-17 /H9252to post-partum mares have been used in an attempt to delay the rst ovulation,enhance uterine involution, synchronize estrus,and/or enhance pregnancy rates. 16,17,69-75In one study, administration of progesterone plus estradioltherapy initiated within 12 hours after foaling andcontinued for 6 days delayed the rst ovulation ofthe year (day 15.6 /H110062.6 days vs 10.3 /H110062.4 days) and increased pregnancy rates (58.5% vs 53.0%) overthat of untreated mares. 72The combination of pro- gesterone and estradiol initiated immediately afterfoaling results in suppression of the normal peripar-turient surge of follicle stimulating hormone andluteinizing hormone, and subsequently delays thedevelopment of rst follicular wave postpar-tum. 76Administration of altrenogest (0.044 mg/ kg) orally once per day for 8 days beginning the dayafter foaling was reported to delay the rst post-partum ovulation to 18.2 days and increased preg-nancy rates over that of untreated mares. 48 Ecbolic agents have been administered to post- foaling mares to promote uterine contractions, elim-inate fluid and debris, and/or decrease the size of theuterus in an attempt to enhance foal-heat concep-tion rates. 25,77-80Most studies report that admin- istration of oxytocin or prostaglandins had no effecton increasing the rate of uterine involution or in-creasing pregnancy rate. One study noted an in-crease in foal-heat pregnancy rate when a syntheticprostaglandin analogue was administered twicedaily for approximately 10 days beginning on theday of foaling. 77 Lavage of the uterus of the post-partum mare has also been used in an attempt to enhance the rate ofuterine involution, remove placental debris, re-duce the degree of inflammation, reduce bacterialnumbers, and/or improve foal-heat pregnancyrate. 6,8,57,58,81,82However, controlled clinical trials determined that there is no advantage in performinga routine uterine lavage on post-partum mares thathad a normal foaling, no retained placenta, or noprolonged or abnormal lochial discharge. 6,57,81,83 A therapeutic uterine lavage may be benecial inmares that experience a retained placenta, pro-longed lochial discharge or presence of an abnormalvolume or adverse character of uterine fluid in thepost-partum period. 51 Adherence to the principles of antibiotic steward- ship dictate that use of antimicrobial agents shouldbe justied. 84The routine use of antibiotics in the post-partum mare is controversial and most oftennot indicated. As noted previously, many post-partum mares have a positive growth on microbialculture and white blood cells are present on uterinecytology, are not treated with antibiotics, and havenormal fertility. Systemic antibiotics may be indi-cated in mares with retained placenta, metritis-sep-ticemia, and/or severe trauma to the reproductivetract. 34Intrauterine infusion of antibiotics, if usedat all, should follow a uterine lavage to eliminateinflammatory debris which may otherwise bind andinactivate the antibiotics. However, there havebeen clinical studies that report an increase in post-partum pregnancy rate following intrauterine infu-sion of antibiotics along with either infusion ofautologous plasma 85or systemic administration of oxytocin.86 Management Strategy One management plan to optimize post-partum con-ception rates in mares with an uncomplicated foal-ing is to perform an initial reproductive examinationon the mare 6 to 8 days after foaling. The goal ofthis examination is to evaluate the reproductivetract for trauma associated with foaling, deter-mine the degree of follicular development, note theamount of uterine edema and identify the pres-ence or absence of fluid in the uterine lumen.A subsequent ultrasound examination is per-formed on day 9 or 10. Mares that ovulate beforeday 10 are not bred, but are administered a dose ofprostaglandins 5 to 6 days after ovulation to lysethe corpus luteum and bring them back into heatearly. Mares that still have a large follicle 10days post foaling are bred using standard tech- or or a gonadotropin-releasinghormone agonist is discouraged until at least day 9or 10, since ovulations early in the post-partum pe-riod are associated with a lower pregnancy rate andhigher embryonic loss rate. Alternative Breeding Options If an owner does not want to breed a mare on the foalheat, but also does not want to wait until the 30-dayheat, an alternative strategy is to administer a doseof prostaglandins 5 to 6 days after the foal-heatovulation to short cycle the mare. 22,32,33This strat- egy results in higher per cycle and per season con-ception rates, a lower pregnancy loss rate andultimately a higher foaling rate than mares rstbred on the foal heat. However, it does result in aslightly longer foaling-to-conception interval (34.9days vs 25.6 days). 32 In lieu of multiple ultrasound examinations to determine the day of the foal-heat ovulation, analternative plan would be to administer a dose ofprostaglandins 17 to 20 days after foaling in anattempt to short cycle the mare, assuming that mostmares will have ovulated by 12 days post foaling.The obvious risk is not knowing if or when a mareactually ovulated in the early post-partum period. 5. Summary Factors that lead to consideration of foal-heat breed-ing include the long equine gestation length, photo-period-dependent physiologic breeding season,limited-duration imposed breeding season, designa-tion of January 1 as the ofcial birth date of foals 142 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHERIOGENOLOGY(North America), and the possibility of a prolonged post-partum anestrus period. However, not everymare is a suitable candidate for foal-heat breedingand each foaling mare should be considered as anindividual. Evaluation of foaling ease and passageof the placenta, a thorough physical and reproduc-tive examination performed ap proximately 6 to 8 days postpartum and monitoring the developmentof the dominant follicle prior to and after day 10will provide critical information for a foal-heatbreeding decision. Adherence to sound reproduc-tive management guidelines can yield an accept-able pregnancy rate while minimizing pregnancyloss. Mares that do not qualify for a foal-heatbreeding may be short cycled by administration ofprostaglandins approximately 5 to 6 days after thefoal-heat ovulation.

Introduction The objective of this study was to evaluate recum- bency at hospital admission as a risk factor for the survival of mares and foals following dystociamanagement. 2. Materials and Methods Retrospective data were obtained from medical re-cords of mares with dystocia between 1995-2018.Mare signalment, ambulation status, and survivaldata were collected. The proportions of mare andfoal survival were analyzed using the chi-squaredand Fisher's exact tests, respectively. Odds ratioswere calculated using univariate logistic regression(Statistix10 Analytical Software). 3. Results The overall proportion of mares that survived afterdystocia resolution was 90.6% (979/1,079) and offoals was 37.2% (402/1,079). condence interval [CI]: 4.21-15.78;P/H110210.001) than recumbent mares. Foals delivered from ambulatory mares had a 12 times greater oddsof survival (OR, 12.22; 95% CI: 2.97-50.34; P/H11021 0.001) than foals delivered from recumbent mares. 4. Discussion Based on these results, mare and foal survival weresignicantly decreased when mares with dystociawere recumbent at admission. Although specula-tive, prolonged laboring and attempts to extract thefoal likely contributed to mare exhaustion and neu-rologic and/or musculoskeletal trauma, resulting inrecumbency. Nonsurvivors rarely stood after deliv-ery. A prompt resolution and/or early referral ofmares with dystocia may reduce the likelihood ofprolonged recumbency and may improve the sur-vival of mares and foals. 146 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHERIOGENOLOGY Research Abstract /L50093for more information, contact the corresponding author NOTESAcknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Authors have adhered to the Principles of Veter- inary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.Conflict of Interest The Authors have no conflicts of interest.

Fetal age/growth evaluation is routinely done in hu- mans based on ultrasonographic measurements offetal parts that are compared to established tables.In this study, a table was generated based on fetal measurements in Quarter Horses (QHs) mainly.Fetal age prediction accuracy was then assessedusing 23 QH pregnant mares. 2. Materials and Methods Fetal ultrasonographic measurements (aortic diam-eter, eye approximated volume [EyV], biparietaldiameter, and femur length) were taken in 10 preg-nant mares with known breeding dates every 2weeks starting at 100 days of gestation to establisha table with each day of gestation and its predictedvalue for the 4 biometric variables. Twenty-threeQH pregnant mares with known ovulation datesunknown to the ultrasonographer were used to as- sess age prediction accuracy for each variable. 3. Results Fetal age was predicted within 2 weeks from 100 to200 days' gestation using femur length, biparietaldiameter, and EyV and within 3 weeks thereafterusing EyV. 4. Conclusion The results suggest that fetal age/growth can beassessed within 3 weeks in QH mares that are morethan 90 days pregnant using the generated tablefrom light breed horses.

Introduction celebrated as \"Ether Day\" in recogni- tion of the rst public demonstration of painlesssurgery by William Morton on October 16, 1846.Morton, a dentist, utilized sulfuric ether vapor atthe Massachusetts General Hospital to provide an-esthesia for the removal of a tumor. The develop- ment was an international sensation, allowingpreviously unbearable surgical procedures to be per-formed. 1This event heralded a new era where those performing surgery (generally pathologists)went from being \"barbarians\" to \"surgeons,\" raisingtheir status in society. Interestingly, this advancepreceded the introduction of the concept of antisep-tic surgery by Lister and then aseptic surgery by Halstead, by more than 20 years. The followingyear, the use of ether for anesthesia of a horse at theRoyal Veterinary College was reported in the news-paper, The Times of London, but widespread use was limited by its lack of potency. 2Chloroform, another inhalant anesthetic administered using amask, was used widely for brief procedures in theearly 1900s but was never considered \"safe.\" 2At the time, the practice of anesthesia consisted pri-marily of local anesthesia, sedation and physicalrestraint. As the science behind the practice ofanesthesia grew, attempts to dene the goals ofanesthesia led Woodbridge in 1957 to establish four specic components: sensory blockade, motorblockade, sleep or mental blockade, and blockade ofundesirable reflex activity. 3 The modern era of equine anesthesia and analge- sia traces from the 1960s when nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, alpha 2adrenoceptor agonists, and inhalant anesthetics became available and wereadopted into equine practice. 4-6In the 60 years since, over 2400 citations concerning equine anes-thesia have appeared at PubMed, attesting to theconsiderable interest in dening and advancingthe science of equine anesthesia. This interest hasbeen largely driven by the development of complexsurgical procedures and advanced imaging modali-ties, many of which require both anesthetic periodsof general anesthesia greater than 60 to 90 minutesand positioning in recumbencies for which the anat-omy of the horse was not designed or to which it has not evolved. It is important to recognize that suchadvances in equine surgery and imaging would nothave been possible without the ability of veterinar-ians to provide an anesthetized state with sufcienthomeostasis to allow for a successful return to astanding posture in a relatively short time. Therehave been numerous notable successes in advancingequine anesthesia, J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURE NOTESically healthy horses remains the most challenging of the common domestic species, with reported mor-tality rates of approximately 0.1 to 1%. 7-9 Horses are physiologically stressed by anesthesia to a greater degree than other species.10Typically, a horse is anesthetized in an unaccustomed placewhere it is administered drugs that cause it to loseconsciousness and fall to the ground or floor. Oncerecumbent, its mouth may be pried open and a largebore tube is inserted into the airway for a period ofminutes to hours. In hospital situations, the horseis often lifted with hobbles by a hoist and positionedon a table in an unnatural position. Then, thehorse is connected to a machine that delivers anes-thetic and controls its breathing. Once an intendedprocedure is completed, the horse is again lifted byits limbs and placed in another room (recovery stall)or space where it is expected to attain a standingposition in a relatively short period of time (lessthan 90 minutes) while recovering from the effects ofthe drugs that caused it to fall down in the rstplace! 2. The Developing Science of Equine Anesthesia The current practices of equine anesthesia haveevolved by necessity and because of the work of alarge number of dedicated individuals and groupswho have provided veterinary colleagues with infor-mation. The author has chosen to highlight publi-cations that have had signicant impact on thedevelopment of the practice of equine anesthesia toits current state. The publications are grouped insix subject areas and within groups are presentedchronologically in an attempt to provide context.The publications were selected based on the author'sexperience and his perusal of the veterinary litera-ture including works on the history of equine anes-thesia. 2,11-13Scientic articles published after the highlighted publications are discussed as a methodto transition to today. Veterinary medicine gained initial prominence in society in large part because of the importance of thehorse in transportation and for work in agriculture.Prior to the development of the profession, much ofmedical care for horses was left to untrained indi-viduals. Books such as The Illustrated Horse Doc- tor, 14published in 1880 by Mayhew were written to \"instruct the novice in such a manner as wouldafford a reasonable prospect of success.\" Such textscovered all of the known maladies were performed with physi-cal restraint of the horse usually in the absence ofadjuvant drugs. Directions for casting the horseincluded: \"Let it be hobbled and never, during theoperation, hear any sound but soothing accents.Animals do not understand words, creatures maynot be able to literally interpret; but they compre-hend all that the manner conveys.\" 14Veterinary care improved as colleges of veterinary medicinewere established and their influence spread. 3. Early Anesthesia Texts Sir Frederick Hobday (of the Hobday procedure onthe equine throat), published an important text, An- aesthesia and Narcosis of Animals and B irds in 1915. 15Hobday was a voice for humane care of animals and promoted augmenting physical re-straint with chemical restraint, believing that sur-gical procedures should be performed as painlesslyas possible. Available \"narcotics\" included chloralhydrate given orally or rectally. Intravenous ad-ministration was discouraged because of \"violent ir-ritation if the fluid nds its way under the skin\" andthe potential for air embolus. The use of morphinewas discouraged because it produced excitement.Practical inhalant anesthesia was limited to chloro-form by inhaler with durations limited to 15minutes. Unmedicated horses were hobbled andcast to the ground prior to application of the inhalerwith the proviso that the hobbles should not beremoved until the animal could rise properly. Professor John G. Wright of the University of Liv- erpool published an early book, Veterinary Anaesthe- sia, in 1941, a text that has been revised andexpanded through 11 editions, the last of which waspresented in 2014. 16The rst edition of this book facilitated the transition from physical restraint tochemical restraint. The authors noted that ade-quate restraint was necessary even for quite simpleprocedures and stated that casting prior to the ap-plication of anesthetics may be necessary to ensuresafety. The use of succinylcholine for painful sur-gery was discouraged but the authors noted that itsuse in casting may be no more distressing thanhobbles and might be less risky. Chlorpromazine,promazine, meperidine, and wereavailable for use as premedicants narcot-ics. anesthesia withchloroform, closed techniques Recoveries from anesthesia were ex-pected to be from 90 minutes to 2 hours in duration. 4. Sedatives and Analgesics Xylazine was introduced as a new sedative forhorses and cattle by Clarke and Hall in 1969. 4 Heart rate and cardiac output decreased and arte-rial blood pressure increased transiently after drugadministration. The authors noted that xylazinewas a \"safe, reliable, short acting sedative\" that was\"better than any other compound in current use.\"Interestingly it was stated that \"heavier dosesseemed to produce no more profound sedation, but 154 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREthe effects became apparent after a shorter time interval and persisted longer.\" Detomidine andromidine followed in the 1980's and 1990's, respec-tively. 17,18Equipotent IV doses for the drugs are reported to be xylazine 1 mg/kg; detomidine 10 mi-crog/kg; and romidine 80 microg/kg. 18Romidine produces less lowering of the head and less ataxiathan xylazine or detomidine at clinically recom-mended doses, which may make the degree of seda-tion produced more difcult to judge. 18 Butorphanol was approved for use in the horse in the 1980s and remains the only opioid agonist withsuch a designation. 19Approved as an analgesic drug for the treatment of abdominal pain, butorpha-nol's primary current use is in combination withalpha 2agonists as an adjunct for standing chemical restraint. Robertson documented the cardiopulmo-nary, sedative, and analgesic effects of butorphanolgiven 5 minutes after xylazine by making a skinincision 5 minutes later. 19The combination pro- duced 15 to 30 minutes of analgesia with minimaland transient hemodynamic effects and insigni- cant respiratory depression. The authors stated,\"The analgesic effects of each drug are additive andprovided good chemical restraint.\" Butorphanolwas not a controlled substance when rst mar-keted for use in the horse. That fact, and paperslike this documenting its efcacy led to its wide-spread adoption. The analgesic and other effects of butorphanol, morphine, 20This paper used the pony's response to repeatable stimulito examine and quantify the analgesic effects ofdrugs. A heat lamp model was used to produceacute supercial pain and a cecal balloon model wasused to assess acute visceral pain. Analgesia wasassessed by measuring how long it took for the ponyto react to the stimulus. Xylazine produced thehighest pain threshold for 60 minutes with signi-cant effects lasting 180 minutes and 240 minutes forsupercial pain and visceral pain, respectively.Morphine was the next best drug for supercial painbut produced only slight effects for visceral pain.Butorphanol was the best drug after xylazine forvisceral pain. Interestingly, flunixin was not shownto be effective for acute pain in this model, but it is widely used as an initial treatment in many in-stances. Modications of this methodology con-tinue to be used widely to assess analgesic effects ofdrugs. A number of drugs and drug combinationshave been reported and Tillot-son. 28Guaifenesin was administered rapidly in 5%solutions alone or in with thiamylal orpentobarbital after sedation acepromazine andmeperidine. Apnea did not occur at induction andat least three times the calculated dose was requiredto produce death. The authors reported thatguaifenesin produced \"excellent results when usedas the sole anesthetic agent in short procedures\" andthe technique had a \"wide margin of safety andconsistently excellent results.\" Although guaifene-sin remains a component of many intravenous an-esthetic combinations, its use as a sole agent isdiscouraged because of its minimal analgesic effects. Likely among the most signicant reports in the history of equine anesthesia was published in 1977by Muir study ofxylazine and ketamine with xylazine given intrave-nously 5 minutes prior to intravenous ketamine.Recumbency occurred within 30 to 60 seconds ofketamine administration and anesthesia lasted ap-proximately 16 minutes with a mean time to stand-ing of 26 minutes. The quality of recovery wasexcellent with most horses standing on their rstattempt. Hemodynamic variables including car-diac output and ventilation were well maintainedwhile arterial oxygenation was decreased. Analge-sia and muscle relaxation were described as good.The authors stated, \"Xylazine and ketamine appearsto be a safe and practicable anesthetic regimen in thehorse.\" This paper provided a safe, humane alterna-tive to just physical restraint or the administration ofsuccinylcholine for short-term \"recumbent restraint\"for procedures like castration. There have been anumber of modications of this technique since itsintroduction but xylazine or another alpha 2agonist and ketamine still form the basis of the majority ofequine anesthetic protocols whether the proceduresare conducted in the hospital setting or in the eld.Substitution of detomidine for xylazine producessimilar quality induction of with recoveries with ataxia. 30,31Re- placing xylazine with rom idine is not recommend- muscle relaxants, such as ormidazolam, are co-administered. 32The addition of to xylazine does not increase the dura-tion of anesthesia but the quality of anesthesia isimproved. 31 Equine veterinarians needed a method to extend xylazine and ketamine anesthesia when the surgicaltask could not be completed in a 15- to 20-minuteperiod. The question of how to safely extend theanesthetic period was answered with the publicationof a paper by Greene in 1986 describing the use ofguaifenesin in combination with ketamine and xyla-zine (Triple Drip or G-K-X) for (TIVA) of 2 hours' thetic conditions were good and the ponies stoodwithout help in 15 to 30 minutes after the infusionwas stopped. This paper provided important infor-mation about an anesthetic technique that contin- /H114082020 155FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREues to be widely used, particularly in out-of-hospital settings. The addition of a muscle relaxant likeguaifenesin to xylazine-ketamine anesthesia ex-tended the anesthetic improved anesthetic conditions. While guaifenesin is usefulin this setting, its use is cumbersome because dilutesolutions (5% to 10%) are required to avoid hemoly-sis and vasculitis after IV administration, resultingin the need to administer a volume of 0.5 t o1Lo f solution to have a signicant effect. An alternativemethod of providing muscle relaxation was ad-dressed in a 1990 report from Brock that compareddiazepam to guaifenesin as the anesthetic adjunct. 34 This paper described the use of diazepam as a re-placement for guaifenesin as part of an inductiontechnique prior to maintenance with halothane.It followed an earlier paper suggesting that the ad-dition of diazepam improved xylazine/ketamine an-esthesia in the eld. 35The authors found that a 0.1 mg/kg dose of diazepam was useful and \"produces aquality of anesthetic induction, transition, and re-covery comparable to guaifenesin.\" 34The required volume of diazepam was smaller (approximately 10mL or less) but was a controlled substance, requiringstrict documentation of use. Subsequent papers haveinvestigated the use of midazolam, another benzodiaz-epine, and have found it to be similarly convenient anduseful. 36,37 The proprietary combination of tiletamine and alpha2adrenergic agonists produces qualitatively similar anesthesiato xylazine-diazepam-ketamine and is of longer du-ration but the quality of recovery is reduced. 38 Propofol, a widely used drug in other species, is notwidely used in horses. Initial reports suggestedthat propofol, after xylazine, was a satisfactory tech-nique but subsequent investigations raised concernswith excitement on induction, signicant respira-tory depression, and and ketamineafter xylazine sedation has been investigated andmay have some applicability, particularly in-hospital settings where ventilation can be easilyassisted. 42 6. Inhalant Anesthetics and the Pathophysiology of Anesthesia and Recumbency Important information concerning the cardiac and respiratory effects of recumbency in anesthetizedhorses were addressed by Gillespie and co-workersin 1969. 43This paper was accompanied by a paper by the same authors in the British literature anddocumented that anesthetized horses have large dif-ferences between their alveolar and arterial oxygentensions. 44Cardiac output was consistently re - duced and calculated pulmonary shunt averaged14% of pulmonary blood flow. Potential causes ofthe dysfunction were postulated to be maldistribu-tion of perfusion down lung; development of atelectasis; and de-creases in cardiac output. The dysfunction oc-curred relatively rapidly with the assumption of recumbency and was not corrected by the delivery oflarge tidal volumes. These papers revealed thatrecumbency associated with anesthesia producedsignicant depression of both cardiovascular andrespiratory function that needed to be counteracted.These papers introduced a subject and line of inves-tigation that have dominated the equine anesthesialiterature since their publication. The recognition that anesthesia, particularly in- halant anesthesia, causes ventilatory compromise led to the development of equipment to provide as-sisted or controlled ventilation. No commercialcompany produced equipment capable of deliveringan adequate tidal volume in an appropriate timeframe so investigators developed equipment fromavailable parts used in human m edicine. An early paper (1975) by Thurmon utilized a Bird Mark IXrespirator powered by an air compressor to compressa multivolume bellows in order to ventilate anesthe-tized horses. 45A rebreathing bag was hermetically sealed in a 12-gallon steel drum (bag in a barrel).The opening of the rebreathing bag was connected toa large animal circle anesthesia machine. This pa-per provided a blueprint for veterinarians to con- struct ventilators of sufcient capacity to ventilate an adult horse. The advent of mechanized assistedventilation allowed for increased complexity and du-ration of surgery because manual compression of alarge animal rebreathing bag to assist ventilationfor more than a few minutes is exhausting and thusimpractical. The equipment required to anesthetize large ani- mals had to be developed de novo because the tidalvolumes and respiratory velocities inherent in therespiration of the horse could not be accommodatedby the available equipment. The dynamics of establishing sufcient percent- ages of the anesthetic gases to provide anesthesiawere considerably different than those seen in hu-man patients or small animals. Steffey addressedthese differences with his paper of 1977 titled, \"Rateof Change of H alothane Concentration in a Large Animal Circle Anesthetic System.\" 46This paper demonstrated how to rapidly anesthetics to maintainanesthesia. maintenance rates concentrations sufcient to main-tain anesthesia. tech-niques provide only 20 minutes of anesthesia thusstrategies to more rapidly increase the concentra-tion of inhalant are required. A suggested strategywas \"to initiate anesthesia with high delivered freshgas flow rates (i.e., 8 to 12 l/min) then after 10 to 15minutes reduce them to low maintenance flows(about 3 to 6 l/min).\" This paper gave veterinariansa way to safely and rapidly develop concentrations ofinhalant anesthetics that produce anesthetic states.Largely because of this paper, flowmeters on large- 66 /H11408AAEP STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREanimal anesthetic machines have 10 L/min flow capacity. The development of specialized anesthetic ma- chines and ventilators and the increased clinicalavailability of arterial blood gas analysis to adjustventilatory variables facilitated the completion oflonger, more complex surgical procedures. Al-though, it was suspected from laboratory studies,the increased use of arterial blood gas analysis con-rmed that a small, but signicant number of anes-thetized horses breathing oxygen concentrations inexcess of 90%, particularly those placed in dorsalrecumbency, did not maintain expected levels of ar-terial oxygenation even when they were ventilatedto produce arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide(PaCO 2) levels in the normal range. Ideally, horses breathing oxygen concentrations in excess of 90%should have arterial partial pressures of oxygen(PaO 2) in excess of 400 mm Hg, but this is infre- quent. The PaO2in some cases falls below those levels seen in standing healthy horses breathingroom air (approximately 90 to 100 mmHg). This\"relative hypoxemia\" has been the subject of over 90scientic publications since the advent of convenientarterial blood gas analysis in the 1970s. Currentthought is that the majority of the impairment ofoxygenation occurs because of physiologic shunts orblood flow through the lung that does not pass byalveoli that are being appropriately ventilated. 47 The alveoli that are not being appropriately venti-lated appear shrunken or atelectic, due to a combi-nation of compression and absorption of the gasescontained in the alveolar space. One of the early,more interesting papers on the subject appeared in1987. Nyman placed small-bore, extended-length endotracheal tubes into the thediaphragmatic lung lobes of adult horses. 48This al- lowed for selective ventilation of the diaphragmatic lobes with the application of positive end expiratorypressure (PEEP). Arterial partial pressures of ox-ygen increased 3 to 3.5 times with the applicationof selective mechanical ventilation with PEEP tothe diaphragmatic lobes alone. These results sug-gested that the diaphragmatic lobes hadcollapsed or were occluded prior to selective ventila-tion. While the technique is impractical for clinicaluse, it established that reduced ventilation of thediaphragmatic lung lobes is a major contributor todifferences between alveolar and arterial oxygentension differences. 7. of Post-operative myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, or tying-up syndrome is a signicant complication of equineanesthesia but its incidence has been greatly re-duced based on the evidence found and the recom-mendations made in a series of papers. The topicwas the subject of a session at the 1978 annualmeeting of the American Association of Equine Prac-titioners. As part of the session, Klein 49presented a review of 50 cases of post-operative myopathy inthe horse and discussed intrinsic and management factors affecting risk. Between 3% and 4% ofhorses anesthetized over a 2-year period in had or muscular decits (localizedand generalized) following anesthesia. No directcauses were established although 46% of myopathichorses had mean arterial blood pressures below 55mm Hg for 30 minutes or longer and duration ofanesthesia (2.9 hours) was longer than in a compar-ison group. Cited potential contributors to myop-athy included difculties in maintaining anesthesiaincluding movement, pronounced cardiopulmonarydepression, and increases in body temperature.This paper supported the growing recognition ofpost-anesthetic complications and suggested thathypotension was a potential contributor. The signicance of arterial hypotension as a factor in postoperative myopathy was established by a pa-per from Grandy et al in 1987. 50Six horses were anesthetized for 3 hours on 2 occasions, once withmean arterial blood pressures maintained in therange of 85 to 95 mm Hg (normotensive) and oncewith mean arterial blood pressures maintained inthe range of 55 to 65 mm Hg (hypotensive). Therewere no signicant complications after the normoten- sive anesthesia but every horse in the hypotensive group had muscle dysfunction with increases in serumenzymes indicative of muscle damage. Three of sixanimals were euthanized due to their condition. Thisstudy provided dramatic evidence of the associationbetween arterial hypotension and post-anesthetic my-opathy. Its conclusions have been conrmed by anumber of subsequent retrospective studies and led toa number of additional investigations looking at meth-ods of monitoring and manipulating arterial bloodpressure under anesthesia. Monitoring arterial blood pressure in anesthe- tized horses and striving to maintain the mean ar-terial blood pressure in excess of 60 to 70 mm Hg arearguably the most important components of safeanesthetic practice, particularly when inhalant an-esthetics are employed. A number of methods havebeen and are being employed in support of bloodpressure including the administration of largevolumes of isotonic fluids, calcium anesthetic adjuncts, vasopressorsand drugs used to increase myocardial contractility.The most consistently useful drug for increasingarterial blood pressure in the anesthetized horse isdobutamine. Dobutamine was compared to a sim-ilar agent, dopamine, in a paper by Swanson et al in1985. 51Horses were anesthetized in two experi- mental groups and received dopamine (3, 5, 10 ug/kg/min, IV) on one occasion and dobutamine (3, 5, 10ug/kg/min,IV) on another. Both drugs producedpositive inotropic effects at doses that increased con-tractility without causing tachycardia. This studydemonstrated that dobutamine was more predict-able than dopamine for support of arterial bloodpressure in horses anesthetized with halothane. /H114082020 157FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURE8. The Recovery Period A recent publication suggests that the portion of morbidity and mortality once associated with themaintenance of anesthesia has been shifted to therecovery phase, presumably due to better anestheticagents and improved monitoring. 9Recovery re- mains the most problematic part of the anestheticperiod, primarily driven by the horse's apparent de-sire to stand soon after regaining consciousness.A number of strategies have been devised to facili-tate the safe return to a standing posture, but noneis without complication. The most comprehensivestudy of recovery was published by Whitehair et alin 1993. 52The paper reported an extensive labora- tory study of horses recovering from inhalantanesthesia without other drugs. Horses were anes-thetized on 3 occasions: twice with halothane (1-and 3-hour duration) and once with isoflurane (3-hour duration). Horses were placed in a recoverystall and allowed to recover undisturbed other thanfor sample collection. Rate of elimination of theinhalants was measured and the time to recoveryevents (eyelid, ear, head, and limb movement, andothers) were recorded. The importance of this pa-per is that it provided a context for evaluating theevents that occur during the transitions between theanesthetized and awake states. Useful signs forgauging the progress of the recovery included in-creasing eyelid and eyeball movement, ear move- ment, swallowing, lifting of the head, and limbmovement. This information allows personnel as- sisting recovery from anesthesia to better determinewhen a horse is ready to stand. Further, the studyprovided basic information for the development ofsubsequent research on methods to modify the re-covery period. 53 9. Morbidity and Mortality Equine anesthesia is more perilous than anesthesiaof the other domestic species as previously noted.A landmark series of papers on morbidity and mor-tality was published by Johnston, beginning in 1995with a preliminary report. 54This paper estab- lished m ortality rates for anesthesia in the horse. The authors collected and analyzed data on 41,824anesthetic episodes from 129 surgical centers. Theoverall death rate within 7 days of anesthesia was1.9%. Death rate of non-colic patients was 0.9%.Cardiovascular arrest or collapse during anesthesiaand fractures or myopathies in recovery accountedfor 33% and 32% of deaths, respectively, with theremainder due to various causes. Horses anesthe-tized for fracture repair, horses anesthetized outsideof normal working hours, and foals less than 1month of age were at increased risk. Risk in-creased with age with horses older than 14 years. Lack of any preanesthetic sedation increased riskand acepromazine administered as a single drug(not in combination) reduced risk. Inhalant anes-thesia without premedication was at higher risk andTIVA of shorter duration was at less risk. By com-parison, the mortality rate in humans was cited as 1in 10,000. Others have examined the issue andreported rates between 0.08 and 1.8% depending onthe design of the study. 7,9As previously noted, a recent paper from 2015, reported on mortality rates,suggesting that the incidence has not changed in 20years. 7,9 10. The Stress of Anesthesia Stress is a signicant component of equine anesthe-sia. The most comprehensive examination of this phenomena was conducted by Taylor 10and pub - lished in a series of articles highlighted by the 1989 publication, \"The Equine Stress Response to Anaes-thesia.\" In a series of accompanying papers, 6 po-nies were anesthetized at least 12 times using avariety of anesthetic drugs, techniques, and inter-ventions (ventilation, cardiovascular support). In-dices of stress (serum cortisol, catecholamines,insulin, glucose) were measured prior to and for 24hours after each anesthetic episode. Ponies anes-thetized with sodium thiopental alone and with TIVA showed little to no evidence of stress. All other anesthetic techniques were stressful. Nor-malization of ventilation and arterial blood pres-sures did not reduce stress. This series of papersestablished that anesthesia (without surgery) is astress for equines. Subsequent papers have largelyconrmed these ndings with the suggestion thatTIVA is less stressful than inhalant anesthesia orsuppresses the stress response. 55The validity of this suggestion is unproven, largely because mostprocedures completed using TIVA are of shorter du-ration, making parallel comparisons difcult. 11. The Things We Know We Know: The Current Practice of Equine Anesthesia The advances that have been made in the period of \"modern\" anesthesia have dramatically improvedthe ability of veterinarians to provide care to equinepatients. Many of these advances are the resultof the development of molecular biology and molec-ular pharmacology which fostered the discovery ofthe mechanism of action of many anestheticdrugs and paved the way for the formulation of newdrugs. The use of drugs in the horse has generallyfollowed their use in humans and other animals butoccasionally developed simultaneously (ketamine)or predated use in humans (alpha 2agonists).11 For example, when xylazine was rst marketed forsedation of the horse, the fact that the majority ofthe drug's effects were produced via stimulation ofalpha 2receptors was not known because the exis- tence of alpha2receptors was unknown until Langer discovered them in 1974. This knowledge facili-tated the development of detomidine, romidine,and dexmedetomidine, and the antagonist, atipam-ezole. In addition, the development and commer-cialization of anesthetic equipment specicallydesigned for large animals, cost-effective cathetersfor IV and intra-arterial use, and clinically useful 158 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREmonitoring equipment including electrocardiograms and blood gas analyzers have brought dramatic im-provements to current practices. The current practice of equine anesthesia is fur- ther shaped by a number of factors including thecollective experiences of equine veterinarians, thescientic literature addressing issues pertinent toanesthesia of the horse, legal considerations, theavailability or lack thereof of some anesthetic med-ications, and the economics of equine practice andthe horse industry. Most equine veterinarians uti-lize standing chemical restraint daily with alpha 2 adrenergic agonists, alone or in combination, beingthe predominant rst choice. 56Most equine veter- inarians performing long-term anesthesiaadminister an alpha 2adrenergic agonist, utilize ketamine alone or in combination with a musclerelaxant for induction of anesthesia and 56Despite these apparent common- alities with regard to the methods used, anesthesiaof the horse remains perilous. So what do we do?Do we accept that somewhere between 1 in 100 and1 in 1000 normal horses will die when anesthetized?Do we avoid anesthetizing horses in favor of stand-ing procedures? Or, do we provide support for in-vestigators to employ focused research to examineand improve our current \"best\" practices or perhaps,discover other pathways to make equine anesthesiasafer? We know we know these things about anesthesia for elective procedures in healthy horses: 1. Anesthesia is stressful for horses.2. Horses will attempt to rise to a standing procedure as soon as they are conscious. 3. Horses that cannot stand 2 hours after anes- thesia are unlikely to survive. 4. Shorter anesthetics ( /H1102160 minutes) are safer, longer anesthetics (/H11022 3 hours) have greater risk. 5. The very young and the old (sedentary) are at greater risk. 6. Horses should be sedated before they are anesthetized. 7. Mean arterial blood pressures less than 60 mm Hg for signicant durations in anesthe-tized horses are associated with increasedcomplications, primarily rhabdomyolysis andneuropraxia. 8. Some level of cardiovascular function, venti- lation, and oxygenation is necessary. 9. Standing chemical restraint is safer than general anesthesia. 10. Lateral recumbency is \"more physiologic\" than dorsal recumbency. Based on these \"knowns\" and other factors, groupsincluding the American College of Veterinary Anes-thesia and Analgesia formulated guidelines to pro-vide direction on appropriate techniques. 57,58Theguidelines recommend a thorough preoperative as-sessment, limiting TIVA to 60 minutes, and moni-toring arterial pressure if are used.Injectable adjuncts such as opioids or ketamine andlocal anesthetics may be indicated to improve thequality of anesthesia. Recommendations for recov-ery include continuous observation and the use ofsedatives to aid in the transition to standing. It isnot known how widely the American College of Vet-erinary Anesthesia and Analgesia guidelines areused, or if it would make a difference if they wereuniversally employed. 59 12. Standing Chemical Restraint in the 21st Century Some 30 years ago, the author penned an editorialtitled, \"The Search for the Ultimate Equine Seda-tive: Are We 'Waiting for Godot.\" 60We are still waiting. In the place of the ultimate equinesedative, veterinarians prefer to use drugs in com-bination. Satisfactory standing chemical restraintcan be produced in most adult horses for extendedperiods of time with alpha 2agonists in combination with opioids or opioid-like drugs being the primarymethod used. 61Longer duration standing chemical restraint in combination with appropriate local andregional anesthesia allows more extensive proce-dures to be performed. Local and regional anes-thetic techniques with longer acting local anestheticdrugs will allow more complex procedures such asdental extractions, sinus exploratory procedures, la-ryngeal tie-backs, and fracture xation to be per-formed in the standing horse, if desired. Additionalprogress will include the development of additionalalpha 2adrenergic antagonists to the currently avail- able tolazoline, yohimbine, and atipamezole. Thecurrent drugs enjoy some popularity but have sig-nicant side effects and durations of action that maybe shorter than the sedatives themselves. 62,63The new agents should have a longer duration of actionand fewer deleterious side effects. 64 13. TIVA in the 21st Century The combination of guaifenesin, ketamine, and xy-lazine remains a mainstay of TIVA in the horse. 33 This popularity continues despite the lack of acommercial pharmaceutical source for guaifenesinsolution, the volume of solution required, and thedifculties keeping guaifenesin in solution. 65The combination is used in eld conditions because itproduces minimal cardiovascular depression andmoderate hypoventilation but in the afrank overdose, rarely apnea. 33,66Perhaps, a phar- maceutical rm will decide to market guaifenesin.More likely, guaifenesin will be replaced by one ofthe benzodiazepines (likely midazolam). Midazo-lam has been investigated as a replacement forguaifenesin and appears to be a useful alterna-tive. 37,67,68Other reported techniques include re- peated boluses of a variety of induction drugs andpropofol-ketamine combinations. 69,70,71Recom - mendations for TIVA drug /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 159FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREinclude limiting duration of anesthesia to 1 hour unless oxygen can be supplemented and ventilationcan be provided, if necessary. If propofol is morewidely adopted, a method for the support of ventila-tion will be required, particularly in out-of-hospitalenvironments. 14. Inhalant Anesthesia in the 21st Century Signicant changes have occurred in the 50 yearssince the introduction of halothane and closed inhal-ant anesthetic systems. 6,11-13Halothane has been the halogenated ethers isoflurane, sevo-flurane, and desflurane. 72,73,74The development of more sophisticated procedures requiringlonger durations of anesthesia have resulted in theconsistent use of mechanical ventilation, an in-creased level of monitoring, a variety of strategies tosupport cardiovascular function, and modicationsin the methods used in recovery. Mechanical ventilation is used to restore normo- capnea and provide consistent delivery of the inhal-ants but standard mechanical ventilation strategies may not restore \"normal\" arterial oxygen tensions inhorses with suboptimal tensions. 43,44,47This has led to the development of a number of strategies forincreasing arterial oxygen tensions that are not con-sistently effective or only effective for short timeperiods. 47A continuing question is, what should the target level of PaO2be?47The question is posed because most techniques of mechanical ventilationused to increase PaO 2do so at the expense of blood flow and arterial blood pressure. Further, studiesassessing the effects of less than ideal PaO 2tensions in anesthetized horses have not shown increasedmorbidity/mortality. 75A recent paper by Hopster et al76suggests that intestinal oxygenation and per- fusion may not be signicantly compromised untilarterial oxygen saturations fall below 80% and meanarterial blood pressures fall below 51 mm Hg, re-spectively. If a PaO 2greater than 60 mm Hg is associated with 80% saturation of hemoglobin, howhard should we work to increase PaO 2above 60 mmHg? The author would argue that the mainte-nance of sufcient arterial blood pressure and car-diac output to deliver oxygen to the tissues is ofgreater importance than employing methods to in-crease PaO 2greater than 70 mm Hg. Monitoring recommendations include the use of direct monitoring of arterial blood pressures in allhorses anesthetized with inhalants. 58Strategies to counteract hypotension include the of and the co-administration ofanesthetic adjuncts allow a reduction in concentrations. 77-79 The currently used halogenated ethers are lesssoluble in blood than halothane so recovery fromanesthesia occurs more rapidly. 52,72-74This has led to the development of equipment, methods,and protocols designed to produce safe recoveryfrom anesthesia.15. Recovery from Anesthesia in the 21st Century Reports on morbidity and mortality rates indicate considerable variation with some reports suggestingthat mortality rates remain at 1% and others point-ing to lower rates. 7-9A recent publication reported no intraoperative deaths (approximately 30% ofdeaths in previous reports) and a shift to fractures inrecovery as the primary source of mortality. 9A number of recovery strategies have been developedincluding the use of head and tail ropes, inflatablepads, swimming pools, slings and drugs, both seda-tives and anesthetics. 80-85Clearly improvements are still required. Potential solutions are compli-cated by the difculty in determining which horseswill have problems in recovery. Many of the inves-tigated strategies are labor, time, and equipment/facility intensive and none eliminate the potentialfor complications. To which cases can they orshould they be applied? The author's best guess isthat some combination of sedation followed by phar-macologic reversal and physical assistance will pro-vide the most practical method of enhancing safetyuntil some, yet-unknown method or technique, ismanifest. 16. Anesthesia of the Neonate and the Young Horse in the 21st Century Horses are more mature at birth than are most of the domestic species and come in varying sizes andtemperaments. Approaches to handling foals arefrequently influenced by the husbandry practices ofthe caretakers, the breed, degree of prior humaninteraction, and other learned behaviors. 86-88The age, attitude, and behavior of the foal should beassessed prior to the administration of any sedativeor analgesic medication with sick foals requiringminimal sedation to accomplish tasks such as cath-eter placement. F oals requiring sedation and/or anesthesia because of temperament or the needfor more extensive procedures should receive acomplete physical examination prior to drugadministration. The cardiovascular system of the neonatal horse has less reserve than that of the adult, making thefoal more dependent on heart rate to maintain car-diac output. 89Foals have a larger surface-to-body weight ratio than adult horses and higher totalbody water, higher extracellular fluid volume, lowerbody fat, lower total protein, and a larger volume ofdistribution for some drugs. 90,91Foals breathe at higher rates than adult horses and have a higherminute ventilatory volumes based on weight. 92 In addition, foals are insensitive to changes in oxy-gen and carbon dioxide tension, thus they hypoven-tilate under anesthesia. Hepatic oxidative capacityfor drugs is lower in 4-day-old foals than in olderanimals but it appears to increase rapidly, reachingadult levels at 3 to 4 weeks of age. Protein bindingappears to be less in the foal than in the adult horsewhich could mean that drugs that are highly proteinbound would be more active. Withholding of food in 160 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREthe foal is not necessary and may be detrimental due to lower glycogen stores. Neonates are generally easy to restrain. Typi- cally, foals can be placed into lateral recumbencyusing physical restraint or by using the \"squeezing\"method. 93Young foals requiring sedation for pro- cedures, such as catheter placement, respond well tothe administration of butorphanol in combinationwith a benzodiazepine (diazepam or 94 The response to benzodiazepines seems tobe signicantly greater in foals compared to adulthorses and the combination produces less cardiopul-monary depression than alpha 2agonists. If this is not sufcient, small doses of xylazine or detomidineare administered IM. Intramuscular administrationreduces the negative cardiopulmonary side effects(bradycardia, respiratory depression) associated withalpha 2administration and increases the duration of action. Sedation combined with restraint and localanesthesia (as necessary) is usually sufcient forrepair of simple lacerations or application of splints. Short-term anesthesia in the eld is performed with the IV administration of ketamine in combina-tion with diazepam or midazolam. The combina-tion (given after sedation) provides approximately15 to 20 minutes of anesthesia. Longer durationscan be accomplished with a combination of guaife-nesin, ketamine, and xylazine. If more extensivesurgical procedures are planned, inhalation anes-thesia should be employed. Foals less than 100 to150 kg can be anesthetized with machines typicallyused for small animals. Retrospective studies sug-gest that the incidence of mortality is reduced infoals when adjuvant drugs such as xylazine andketamine are used in combination with inhalants. 8 Serum glucose concentrations should be monitoredand glucose containing fluids used in the very youngfoal under general anesthesia. Thermoregulationis impaired so it is important to monitor body tem-perature and warm the foal, if necessary, postoper-atively. The differences between foals and adulthorses that affect anesthesia are, for the most part,resolved by 3 to 4 months of age. 17. Pain Management in the 21st Century A recent review of pain control in horses begins withthe sentence, \"Currently, approaches to pain controlin horses lack a robust evidence base\" and notes thatpain control is both an art and a science. 95With the increasing life expectancy of the horse, it is for- tunate that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs pro- vide relatively consistent, low-cost pain relief formany arthritic conditions, allowing many aginghorses to live apparently comfortable lives. Whereefforts are inadequate is in the control of pain notalleviated by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugadministration that persists beyond a 24-to-48-hourperiod. This inadequacy is particularly apparentin horses with severe laminitis. 96A variety of strategies are currently employed including the ad-ministration of alpha 2adrenergic agonists, opioids,lidocaine, and ketamine, alone combination.86 drugs, gabapentin and tramadol, showsome in 97-99Soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors cur - rently being investigated may provide a novel methodof anti-inflammatory activity through their inhibitionof cytochrome P450 pathways. 100 Pain management in the horse as in other species requires at least 3 components: recognition thatthe pain exists; a desire to provide relief from thepain; and the ability to provide relief. Decienciesor controversies exist in each area. The develop-ment of pain scoring systems has provided methodsfor systematic assessment of pain and has served toraise consciousness, but their principles are not usedwidely. 101The author knows of no veterinarian who would not want to relieve a horse's pain, butrecent surveys indicate that there is considerablevariability within the profession with regard to whatprocedures or conditions are thought to produce alevel of pain that requires treatment or the level oftreatment that should be provided. 102Finally, new methods and medications must be developed oradapted to optimize comfort for our equine patients. 18. Managing Equine Stress in the 21st Century The role that stress plays in the complications asso-ciated with equine anesthesia deserves increasedattention as we try to improve outcomes. Anesthe-sia stresses horses more than it does other domesticanimals and the consequences of stress go beyondjust behavioral issues extending to decreases in im-mune function and other effects. 103Known poten- tial stressors that may be associated with surgeryand anesthesia might include transportation to anew facility, separation from a pasture mate, orwithholding of food. Stressors associated withanesthesia itself might include restraint, hypercar-bia, hypoxemia, hypotension, and pain. Transpor-tation, fasting, and anesthesia all signicantlyaltered intestinal microflora in horses. 104With- holding of food prior to anesthesia for periods of up to 24 hours was once widely recommended but the prac-tice is seemingly less prevalent. Recent work sug-gests that the incidence of post-operative colic may beincreased when food is withheld, potentially due tobetter maintenance of gastrointestinal motility in fedhorses. 105 Individual horses have variable responses to a variety of stimuli. Current anesthetic practicesand techniques do not consistently reduce the stressrelated to anesthesia. There is an interesting, rel-atively new, body of work in the area of horse per-sonalities including information about differencesdue to breed, use, husbandry, genetic variation,and receptor populations. Many equine veterinar-ians have developed different dosing regimens fordifferent breeds or types of horses based on theirexperiences and anecdotal reports. For example,the author believes that draft horse breeds andAmerican Saddlebreds require smaller doses of 161FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREalpha2agonists basis) to produce useful se- dation compared to mustangs, Arabian horses, and Appaloosas. Minimal hard data are available todirectly support such beliefs. Lloyd et al 106looked at the personalities of 8 different breeds in theUnited Kingdom, nding that Thoroughbreds, Ara-bian horses, cobs, and Welsh ponies were signi-cantly more anxious and excitable than the otherbreeds assessed. More recently, Sackman andHoupt 107assessed 16 behavioral traits in over 850 American horses via a survey of their own-ers. They determined that Arabians, Thorough-breds, and Walking Horses were the most nervousand American Quarter Horses, Paints, Appaloosas,and drafts were the least nervous breeds. Anotherinteresting paper from Sweden analyzing the ge-nome of Swedish warmblood horses identied longareas of homozygosity shared by 85% of the warm-bloods, suggesting that such \"signatures\" could beresponsible for behavior, physical abilities, and fer-tility. 108With regard to specic drug classes, Wet- more found differences in locomotor responses tofentanyl between horses with and without polymor- phism of the mu opioid receptor, which may helpexplain the previously reported differences in re-sponse to similar drugs. 109,110Others have com- pared the opioid and alpha2receptor populations of horse brains to other species and found differencesin the distribution of receptors, perhaps accountingfor the variability in efcacy and side effects of opi-oids across the horse, dog, guinea pig, and rat. 111,112 As work on the an alysis of the horse genome con- tinues, perhaps scientists will discover additionalinformation to help development of new receptor- specic agents or specic techniques to modify be-havior and reduce perianesthetic stress in equinepatients. A better method of assessing the stress level of patients prior to anesthesia with the goal of mini-mizing stress throughout the perioperative period isneeded. Historically, physiologic measures such asheart rate, heart rate variability, and blood or sali-vary cortisol levels have been used to measurestress. 113,114Other potential indices include height of head carriage, orientation of the ears, fre- quency of vocal behavior, and mouth movements.115 Each of these methods have limitations. Recently,an interesting paper suggested that assessing eyeblink rates and eyelid twitches may be useful as anoninvasive way to predict a horse's response tostress. The investigators utilized feed restriction,separation from paddock mates, and a startle test toinduce stress while recording eye movements, not-ing that eyelid blinks decreased and eyelid twitchesincreased as stress levels increased. 116Perhaps moving forward, there will be better methods toassess stress and when possible, adjust anesthetictimes and methods to minimize its effects onoutcomes.19. Moving Forward: Aspirational Goals for Equine Anesthesia The author has attempted to describe and provide evidence for the \"known knowns\" of equine anesthe-sia. 117As previously stated, the current practices of equine anesthesia have evolved by necessity andbecause of the work of a large number of dedicatedindividuals and groups who have provided veteri-nary colleagues with information. Many, but notall of these individuals are included in the refer-ences cited in this report. Much gratitude for theinformation that has fostered clinical progress isowed to them. What are left are the \"known un-knowns\" and \"unknown unknowns\" (things we don'tknow we don't know). 117Today, if we effectively manage the list of \"known knowns\" of equine anes-thesia, we position a horse in a recovery stall withsufcient faculties to regain consciousness and at-tain a standing position in a reasonable amount oftime. Currently, that results in a mortality rate ofsomewhere between 0.1% and 1% for \"physiologi-cally normal\" horses. We need to do better. \"Known unknowns\" include lack of knowledge on how best to facilitate the patients' smooth, uncom-plicated return to a conscious standing posture in arepeatable, practical, and widely applicable manner.As referenced above, a number of methodologieshave been proposed and reported but few are uni-versally and practically applicable. Most of the ev-idence currently available is from clinical studies,both retrospective and prospective, that comparecurrently available methods to determine whichmethod should be \"preferred.\" The problem is that\"preferred\" is not good enough. What is needed isan organized, focused, scientic approach to exam-ining equine behavior in the recovery stall with thegoal of modifying the transition from the inducedrecumbent \"sleep\" of anesthesia to an awake, stand-ing horse. Such an approach will require a coregroup of individuals from a variety of disciplines(anesthesiologists, surgeons, behaviorists, etc.) withthe interest, resources, and time not only to inves-tigate the \"known unknowns\" but also to discoverand solve the \"unknown unknowns.\" Success inthis regard requires nancial support to both facili-tate the work of creating new knowledge in equineanesthesia and to inspire both present and succeed-ing generations of veterinarians to take on the pres-ent challenges. Both actions, in turn, willmeaningfully improve health care delivery to equinepatients.

AAEP /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 J. MILNE Vets Martha Mallicote, DVM, MBA, DACVIM The impact of the current DVM student loan burden on the veterinary profession, and most particularly the equine veterinary profession, cannot be overstated. An important part of the solution to thischallenge is a clear understanding of loan repayment strategies that are realistic solutions for recentgraduates. This presentation will review the programs and strategies for student loans to assist grad-uates in planning their approach to this nancial challenge. Author's address: College of mfmallicote@gmail.com. \u00a9 2020AAEP. 1. Terminology Principal\u2014The total sum of money borrowed plus any interest that has been capitalized. Interest\u2014A loan expense charged for the use of borrowed money. Interest is paid by a borrower toa lender. The expense is calculated as a percentageof the unpaid principal amount of the loan. Interest rate\u2014The numerical percentage at which interest is calculated on a loan(s). Unsubsidized loan\u2014Interest on unsubsidized loans accrues from the date of disbursement andcontinues throughout the life of the loan. Theseloans are available to graduate students with nonancial need required and the school determinesthe amount available to borrow based on cost ofattendance (subsidized loans are only for under- grads\u2014the Department of Education pays intereston direct subsidized loans while in school). Capitalization\u2014The addition of unpaid interest to the principal balance of a loan. This increases theoutstanding principal amount due on the loan.Interest is then charged on that higher principalbalance, increasing the overall cost of the loan and the monthly payment amount. 2. Introduction\u2014The Basics of Getting Organized In order to identify the best plan for student loanrepayment, one must rst assess the details of whatthey will be managing\u2014from both a debt and incomeperspective. First, get the details about the loans: what type of loans were issued and how much money is owed?Who is the loan servicer? Will there be a graceperiod following graduation? For federal loans, this information can be found through nslds.ed.gov. For any private loans (these are much less common), check the borrower's creditreport to conrm all private loans and identify thelender. Grace periods of 6 months (9 months onPerkins loans and 12 months on Health Professionsloans) will be in effect after graduation\u2014ensurethat the borrower is still eligible on all loans and didnot use up this grace period after the completionof undergraduate training. A grace period is only 166 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRENGTHENING THE FOUNDATION OF YOUR PRACTICE NOTESavailable ONCE to any given borrower, even for new loans that are issued in a graduate program. Then, regarding income: what kind of payment will be affordable after graduation? What is theAdjusted Gross Income for the rst 6 months ofrepayment and then likely Adjusted Gross Incomefor the next year? Can automatic electronic debitbe set up? Finally, regarding repayment strategy: Is con- solidation or renancing right? What repaymentstrategy will combine realistic amounts and leasttotal amount paid out for the loan? Use a repayment calculator to assess WHICH plan will be best for each individual situation!Data used in the Free Application for Federal Stu-dent Aid required of all borrowers can be pluggedright into the calculators. Start this analysis rightafter graduation and ensure alternate payment planapplications are led no later than 2 months beforethe end of the grace period to allow time for accep-tance. It is incredibly important to consider eachindividual scenario in determining the ideal repay-ment strategy\u2014factors such as individual andspouse income, children, career goals (pursuit of spe-cialty training versus entering practice), householdexpenses and personal feelings about carrying debtall influence the selection of debt repaymentstrategy. After getting the repayment plan in place, set up automatic direct debit for payments in advance andget an interest rate discount of 0.25%. Be ready tostart paying the loan back on time\u2014a quarter to athird of borrowers are LATE on the very rstpayment. 3. Solution\u2014Details and Repayment Strategies DVM Student Loans Federal student loans that are currently being is- sued are Direct Loans\u2014the US Department of Edu-cation is the lender. Loans issued prior to July 1,2010 are likely Federal Family Education (FFEL)Loans, which were either federally issued/held orcommercially held loans with federal guarantees. Primary vet student loan types are listed below: Unsubsidized Stafford Loan (currently at 6.08% interest prior to July 2020 reset). Plus Loan (unsubsidized, currently at 7.08%interest prior to July 2020 reset). Health Professions Loan\u2014subsidized, 5%interest. Perkins Loan\u2014subsidized, 5% interest. Loan Consolidation It may be necessary to consolidate for eligibility forsome repayment programs. For example, FFELloans (prior type of loans) aren't eligible for the Payas You Earn (PAYE) program, but a consolidationloan IS eligible. Borrowers are eligible to consoli-date at graduation, departure from school, or belowhalf-time enrollment. It is important to discuss theadvantages/disadvantages of consolidation with theloan servicer\u2014some benets may be lost with con-solidation. There is no interest rate benet, but theborrower may be able to secure lower cost paymentswith an income-driven repayment scheme by consol-idating and waiving the grace period to immediatelyenter repayment. Consolidation will also likelygive the borrower less to keep up with in terms ofloans and paperwork. Loans MUST be in repayment or grace period to start the consolidation process. There is no appli-cation fee for consolidation, so avoid and beware ofprivate companies that offer to do that at a cost tothe borrower. Most federal student loans, including the follow- ing, are eligible for consolidation: Direct Subsi-dized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, SubsidizedFederal Stafford Loans, Unsubsidized Federal Staf-ford Loans, Direct PLUS Loans, PLUS loans fromthe FFEL Program, Supplemental Loans for Stu-dents, Federal Perkins Loans, Federal NursingLoans, Health Education Assistance Loans andsome existing consolidation loans. Private educa-tion loans are not eligible for consolidation. If indefault, certain requirements must be met beforeconsolidating loans. Loan Renancing Renancing is different from consolidation of loans\u2014some private lenders will offer renancing at interestrates that seem appealing (lower than rates paid forstudent loans). Be aware that the rules protectingstudent loan borrowers (allowing changes in paymentstied to borrower income and access to repaymentschemes based on type of employment) will not applyto these private loans. This is best used if the bor-rower intends to pay off the loan before it is due and iscomfortable with the maximum potential monthlypayment (more commonly with smaller loans and ag-gressive repayment plans). Repayment Plans The most common repayment plans are as follows: Standard/Fixed Plans Standard Repayment. Under this plan the bor- rower pays a xed monthly amount for a loan term of up to 10 years. Depending on the amount of theloan, the loan term may be shorter than 10 years. Extended Repayment. This plan is like stan- dard repayment, but allows a loan term of 12 to 30 years, depending on the total amount borrowed.Stretching out the payments over a longer termreduces the size of each payment, but increases thetotal amount repaid over the lifetime of the loan. Graduated Repayment. Unlike the standard and extended repayment plans, this plan starts off with lower payments, which gradually increase ev-ery 2 years. The loan term is 12 to 30 years, de- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 167BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRENGTHENING THE FOUNDATION OF YOUR PRACTICEpending on the total amount borrowed. The monthly payment can be no less than 50% and nomore than 150% of the monthly payment under thestandard repayment plan. The monthly paymentmust be at least the interest that accrues. Income-Driven Repayment Plans PAYE. Payments under the PAYE plan are based on the borrower's income and the total amount of debt. Monthly payments are adjusted each year asthe borrower's income changes and monthly pay-ments will be 10% of discretionary income, but nevermore than would be paid under the 10-year Stan-dard Repayment Plan. PAYE is for a loan term of20 years. Initial loans can be issued no earlier than2007 and disbursements must have been receivedafter October 2011. Revised Pay as You Earn (REPAYE) is similar to PAYE. If married, both the borrower and theirspouse's income or loan debt will be considered whencalculating the payment amount, whether taxesare led jointly or separately (with limitedexceptions)\u2014in PAYE this does not occur. Re-payment will likely continue into 25 years, due tograduate loans being included. Income-Based Repayment is similar to PAYE and REPAYE, but caps the monthly payments at 10% to15% of discretionary income. Repayment is over aterm of 20 to 25 years, depending on the types ofloans held. Income-Contingent Repayment is also similar to those above but monthly payment will be the lesserof 20% of discretionary income, or the amount onewould pay on a repayment plan with a xed pay-ment over 12 years. The loan term is up to 25years. Income-Contingent Repayment is availableonly for Direct-Loan borrowers. **It is important to note that income tax is due on any amount that is forgiven for thestandard income-driven repayment schemes.This tax is based on the fact that the forgivenamount is reported as income in the year it is for-given\u2014the entire tax bill will be due THAT year. An excellent chart comparing these options and their terms can be found at https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand/plans. Ultimately,the choice of which repayment strategy to take de-pends on factors including individual and householdincome, children, career trajectory, and householdexpenses. Personal feelings about carrying debtalso cannot be ignored\u2014for some individuals, theconcept of carrying a large loan that will not be paidoff by the borrower (as with income-based repay-ment schemes) is not acceptable. The use of repay-ment calculators can help determine which is thebest overall nancial approach, while also takinginto account the individual factors above. For standard borrowers who are recent or current DVM graduates, PAYE is typically the best income-driven repayment choice\u2014but everyone's variablesare different and individual assessment is impor-tant. For borrowers who determine that they willrepay their entire loan (NOT use income-driven re-payment with loan forgiveness), aggressive repay-ment to minimize interest charges will decrease thetotal nancial burden. For borrowers who utilizeincome-driven repayment and forgiveness, payingthe least amount of money into the loan will maxi-mize the nancial benet. Loan Forgiveness Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Programforgives the remaining balance on Direct Loans after120 qualifying monthly payments under a qualify-ing repayment plan while working full time for aqualifying employer. Private loans are not eligiblefor forgiveness with this program. Qualifying em-ployers include government organizations at anylevel (federal, state, local, or tribal), Not-for-Protorganizations that are tax-exempt [501(c)(3)], andother types of not-for-prot organizations that pro-vide certain types of qualifying public services.The PSLF has gotten substantial bad press over thelast 2 years as some borrowers have reached theirpoint of loan forgiveness. Unfortunately, many ofthe rst borrowers to enter PSLF were misinformedabout qualifying loans and payments\u2014many 2007loans did not qualify as is and needed to be consol-idated to qualify under the program terms. Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program will pay up to $25,000 each year toward qualiededucational loans of eligible veterinarians who agreeto serve in a National Institute of Food and Agricul-ture (NIFA)-designated veterinarian shortage situ-ations for a period of 3 years. Program details anda map of eligible areas can be found here: www. nifa.usda.gov/program/veterinary-medicine-loan-repayment-program. For m ixed large-animal vet- erinarians, this may be a useful adjunct to loanrepayment when working in relatively underservedareas. Armed Forces F. Edward He \u00b4bert Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship Program \u2014students receive full tuition at any accredited veterinary,medical, dental, psychology, or optometry program,plus a generous monthly stipend of more than$2,000. There is an active-duty service obligationto the US Army is 1 year of service for every year ofscholarship received. Army Active Duty Health Professions Loan Repayment Program pays up to $120,000 over 3 years to repay veterinary schoolloans for active duty; participants receive $40,000per year for 3 years. For reserve duty, veterinari- ans are eligible for loan repayment of up to $50,000over 3 years through the Healthcare ProfessionalsLoan Repayment Program; participants receive$20,000 per year for the rst 2 years and $10,000 thethird year. State-Funded Loan Repayment Programs \u2014some states have passed legislation establishing their ownloan repayment or loan forgiveness programs forveterinarians. 168 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRENGTHENING THE FOUNDATION OF YOUR PRACTICEAdvanced Training/Graduate Students The common \"old sage\" advice for DVMs in graduate or specialty training programs was to enter loandeferment during the training program due to lowincome. Deferment allows the borrower to com-pletely avoid making payments and borrowers canindeed qualify under the economic hardship clauseto do so, but there are consequences to this choice.Unsubsidized and private loans will continue to ac-cumulate interest in the deferment period and thisaccrued interest will be capitalized when the bor-rower reenters repayment. With the availability ofincome-driven repayment schemes, the lower-in-come trainee DVM can continue making very mini-mal payments tied to their income status. Thisallows the borrower to accumulate time paying onthe loan but with very small payments. If the bor-rower is utilizing an income-driven scheme withloan forgiveness over the long term, this is nan-cially advantageous\u2014particularly for those in thePSLF program with its shorter timeline. Withcareful investigation and planning, time spent inadvanced training programs may even be countedagainst the years of nonprot work required for for-giveness under the PSLF. 4.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 169BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRENGTHENING THE FOUNDATION OF YOUR PRACTICEWhy Veterinarians Are Leaving Equine Practice Amy L. Grice, VMD, MBA Data show that over the last 20 years, fewer new graduates are entering equine practice and nearly half have left the equine eld by the fth year after graduation. With a signicantnumber of AAEP members over the age of 50 years, there may be a shortfall in veterinarians tocare for our nation's horses in the near future. Author's address: PO Box 192, Virginia City,MT 59755; e-mail: AAEP. 1. Introduction American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) membership records show that more than50% of recent graduates have failed to renew their membership within 5 years following their gradua-tion, a gure that has been trending upward (Fig.1). 1For example, of those AAEP members gradu- ating in 2014, by 5 years later in 2019, 52% were nolonger members. In addition, the number of newgraduates that chose careers in equine practicedropped from 5.7% in 2003 to 1.1 in 2017, and thenincreased slightly to 1.5% in 2018, according toAmerican Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA)data (Fig. 2). 1 Over 200 job opportunities have been consistently available on the AAEP Job Board over the pastseveral years, and many practices report receivingfew to no applications. In veterinary medicine as awhole, the unemployment rate was 0.8% in 2019,and according to the AVMA Career Center, appli-cant to job ratios varied between states, with themajority having a ratio from 0.0 to 0.5. 2Currently, about two thirds of AAEP members are less than 50years of age, with 17.4% aged 51 to 60 years, and26.6% over the age of 60 years. aOver the next decade, it is likely that many of these practitioners,which represent 44% of the AAEP membership, will retire. If the attrition of new equine practitionerscontinues and the retirements of aging equine vet-erinarians expected, horse owners couldexperience difculty nding equine-focused doctorsto care for their mounts, especially in some morerural regions. Against this backdrop, an effort was made to de- termine possible reasons for the trend of decreasingattraction and retention of veterinarians in equinepractice. 2. Methods and Materials An eight-question survey link utilizing Survey Mon-key was distributed on several Facebook sites inMay 2019. The sites utilized were the closedgroups Women in Equine Practice, Equine Vet-2-Vet, Moms with a DVM, and AAEP Member VetTalk. The survey was open for about 10 days, and647 veterinarians responded. The survey instructions asked the doctors to an- swer based on the equine practice where they werecurrently working or where they had previouslyworked before leaving the career. Survey ques-tions to assess the proles of the respondents in-cluded the percentage of equine work done by thepractitioner, the year of graduation from veterinary 170 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRENGTHENING THE FOUNDATION OF YOUR PRACTICE NOTESschool, whether the respondent was an associate or an owner, and the size of the practice. The mostimportant questions in the survey were those thatfocused on leaving the profession. All of the ques-tions allowed the veterinarians to write comments. 3. Results When asked, \"How much of your practice is or wasequine?\", the majority of the respondents (63.8%)reported that they were currently or had formerlybeen at a 100% equine practice, followed by 24.6%that reported their practice was 75% to 99% equine.Few respondents reported less than 75% equinework (Fig. 3). Because the noted trend of attrition of equine graduates from AAEP membership showed an in-crease from 2000 onward, the survey broke the re-spondent cohort into fairly small groups in order tosee if there were differences among different sets ofgraduation years. Those graduating 10 years ormore ago were grouped together, while the mostrecent decade was grouped in 3-year increments.As might be expected, the majority (50.8%) of re-spondents graduated in 2009 or prior. The mostrecent decade was well represented in each of thethree segments of graduation years (Fig. 4).Another survey question asked, \"Are or were you an associate or owner in equine practice?\" Mostlikely due to about half of respondents graduating inthe last decade, associates (64.6%) outnumberedowners (35.4%) overall. When looking at just thosewho graduated in the last decade, 80.6% identiedthemselves as associates and 19.4% identied asowners. This is in contrast to those graduating in2009 or before, of whom 49% reported they wereassociates and 51% reported they were practiceowners. Respondents were fairly equally distributed among different sized practices, providing a view ofequine veterinarians across a variety of work set-tings. The equine veterinary industry is largelymade up of small practices. While only 20.9% re-ported being solo practitioners, well below theapproximately 35% of AAEP members that consis-tently report being solo, over 58% reported workingin practices of 1 to 3 veterinarians. This is consis-tent with the ndings of the 2016 AVMA AAEPEconomic Survey, which found that 52.5% of equinepractices have 2 or fewer full-time equivalent (FTE)veterinarians. 1Almost 20% of respondents re- ported working at large practices with more than 6doctors. Again, this result showed consistency with Fig. 1. Percentage attrition in AAEP membership in 5 years since graduation. Fig. 2. Percentage of new graduates entering equine private practice.

The rst questionin the survey asked, \"Which statement is true for you?\"and the answers included, \"I have never consideredleaving equine considered \"I am currently consid-ering leaving equine practice but have not decided,\"and \"I have left equine practice or have denitely de-cided to leave equine practice\" (Fig. 6). Somewhat shockingly, only 181 (28%) of the 645 respondents have never considered leaving the profes-sion of equine veterinary medicine, of whom 107 grad-uated in 2009 or before. Of the 80 respondents whograduated in 2016 to 2018, 22 (27.5%) had never con-sidered leaving and 30 (37.5%) had considered leavingand decided to stay. Similarly, 20.6% of the 126 re-spondent graduates of 2013 to 2015 had never consid-ered leaving and 35.7% had considered leaving anddecided to stay. Of those 110 respondents graduatingin 2010 to 2012, 22.7% had never considered leavingequine practice and 37.3% had considered leaving anddecided to stay. Because the recession of 2009 to2011 affected equine practice substantially, one mighthave expected there to be higher attrition in thosegraduation years, but the data do not support this. Sadly, 127 (19.7%) of the total 645 respondents have already left or have denitely decided to leave equinepractice, and another 113 (17.5%) are currently con-sidering leaving the profession. When considered bygraduation year, 19.5% of those graduating in 2009 orprior have left or have denitely decided to leave, Fig. 5.

When this question was analyzed by size of practice, interesting results emerged. Those respondentsworking for themselves as solo practitioners were theleast likely to have considered leaving equine practice,and the least likely to have left equine practice. Theywere similar in percentage to respondents from largepractices with more than 6 veterinarians in consider-ing leaving but deciding to stay. However, they weremore likely than those working at larger practices tobe currently considering leaving equine veterinarymedicine. Surprisingly, those in larger practices of 4or more doctors were the most likely to have left or bedenitely leaving the career (Fig. 8). When consideredadditively, those respondents in practices of 2 to 3doctors (39.58%) and 4 to 6 doctors (40.29%) werethose most likely to be currently considering leavingequine practice but not yet decided, or to have alreadyleft equine practice or denitely decided to leaveequine practice (Fig. 9). However, those in practiceswith more than 6 doctors were close behind with37.30%. Solo practitioners were lower at 29.85%. Understanding why talented equine veterinarians are leaving the profession was the main objective ofthis survey, and to that end, questions were asked toidentify both the contributing as well as the primaryreasons for the exodus. The top 5 contributing factorswhen respondents could select all factors that influ- enced their decisions were lifestyle and number ofwork hours required (57.7%), emergency on-call duty(53.0%), low salaries and compensation (51.8%), men-tal health and stress (44.5%), and culture of equineveterinary industry (36.6%).

Forty-one respondents chose \"Other\" as one of the reasons for considering leaving equine practice.Those respondents choosing \"Other\" were asked tocomment. A total of 81 comments were made onthis question. Included was the following: \"Ithink for me, the main reason I could not makeequine practice work was because of the culture anddemanding hours. It was a challenge before kids,but afterwards it became impossible. Being on call50% of the time with a newborn that didn't sleep wasan enormous strain on our family, and if I'm beingcompletely honest it put my marriage in jeopardy.Then taking time off to take my sick daughter to thedoctor was a strain on the practice. Planning toleave early one day to pick up my kid on a day myhusband had a late meeting was a lot to ask myemployer. Trying and failing to make it home intime for dinner was the norm. The list goes on.I did look for other equine jobs, but never found onein our area that seemed to be enough of an improve- ment to make it worth it. For now, I am doing SA[small animal], and hope to get back to equine aftermy kids are a bit older\u2014maybe solo. I hate to beanother female vet that couldn't make it in equinepractice. It's all I ever wanted to do, since I was 7;I completed an internship and almost accepted aresidency; I thought I was well prepared and fullyinformed on what to expect out of this career path.I love equine medicine, but could not nd a way to do it and also feel like I was being a good mother/wife\u2014or even daughter/sister/friend/etc.\" Another comment was, \"Equine practice is still very much a lifestyle, not a job. The lines betweenclients & friends is blurred. Not only must you beavailable 24/7 and are made to feel guilty if you arenot, forget about going to the barn to play with yourhorses uninterrupted. I go, only when I know oth-ers won't be there, and it causes me more anxietythan calm. As much as these clients act likefriends, I am a monkey that serves them. And if Idied, they'd nd another monkey. That's a toughreality when you dedicate your life to something.The people make it suck, the stupidly low pay andconstant on-call make it sick [sic]. The horsesmake it worth it.\" Other comments referenced un-ethical behavior, a \"good old boys club\", inability tocompete with online options that can sell below asmall practice's cost of goods, misogyny, inadequatesupport staff, and a lack of opportunity to buyshares. The most prevalent reasons chosen for leaving equine practice did not differ considerably betweengraduate year cohorts, but there were interestingtrends in the percentage of respondents choosingeach option. Lifestyle and number of work hoursrequired was the most frequently named contributorto respondents' decisions to leave or consider leavingequine practice across all graduation years, cited by52.7% of those graduating in 2009 or before, 58.9% ofthose graduating in 2010 to 2012, 67.5% of 2013 to2015 graduates, and 61.3% of respondents from2016 to 2018. Those from more recent graduatingyears were more likely to attribute low salaries andcompensation to influencing their departure, with Fig. 9. Survey question: \"Which statement is true for you?\" By size of practice with only, \"I am currently considering leaving equine practice but have not decided,\" and \"I have left equine practice or denitely decided practice.\" Answersconsidered Fig. 10.

One respondent com-mented, \"I could literally not afford to eat meat.I love the job, but it wasn't sustainable.\" Emergencyon-call duty, and mental health and stress were lessfrequently reported by those graduating in 2009 orprior compared to the most recent decade's gradu-ates. A sharply rising trend in the importance ofeducational debt and a smaller rise in influence ofthe culture of the equine veterinary industry wasseen across graduation years (Fig. 11). Respondents to the survey were asked to choose the most important factor in their decision to leave or consider leaving equine practice. Not surpris-ingly, those factors that were the most prevalentwhen multiple reasons could be chosen, again rose tothe top in the responses. Lifestyle and number ofwork hours required was the most frequently chosenresponse (27.5%), followed by emergency on-callduty (17.9%) and mental health and stress (11.6%).Low salaries and compensation (10.0%) garnered afourth place in importance, followed by culture of mypractice (9.8%) (Fig. 12). When responses were sorted by graduation year, clear differences in the most important factors be-came evident. While lifestyle and number of hoursworked was the primary factor across almost allgraduation years, after that a divergence was appar-ent. Low salaries and compensation was chosen asmost important by more of those respondents whograduated in 2016 to 2018 and decreased in impor-tance as a factor the more years the respondent hadbeen in practice. Mental health and stress werechosen by more 2016 to 2018 graduates as the pri-mary reason for leaving or considering leaving com-pared to all other graduation years, but those whograduated in 2009 or before showed an increasingtrend compared to those who graduated in 2010 to2012. Emergency on-call duty was lower in impor-tance as a factor among graduation years 2016 to2018, and showed an ascending trend from the mostrecent graduation years to later years, peaking foryears 2010 to 2012 as the most important factor forthose respondents at 19.64% and then decreasingsomewhat (14.24%) for those who graduated in 2009or before. The culture of the equine industry washigher in importance as a factor for the most recentgraduates, while the culture of the practice in whichthe respondent worked became more signicant asyears in practice accumulated, then waned in thosemore than 10 years out of school. Having childrenincreased in signicance to those who were in grad-uation years 2010 to 2012 and 2013 to 2015 beforedeclining somewhat, most likely reflecting child-bearing years. The same trend was seen with ed-ucational debt, which could be influenced by theincreasing nancial needs of those with families orthe purchase of a house. Physical injuries or wearand tear increased with time since graduation, notsurprisingly. The needs of elderly family membersand other nancial stresses were of little conse-quence in choosing to leave equine practice fornearly all respondents (Fig. 13). The nal question of the survey asked what those who had left practice were doing now. About 47%of respondents reported that they are now in com-panion animal practice and another 10% have anacademic position of some kind. Another 4% of re-spondents reported they are now working in indus-try and government positions. 4. Discussion The culture of the equine veterinary industry andthat of many individual practices has not changedas the demographics of the profession have changed. Fig. 11. Survey question: \"What factors contributed to you leaving or considering leaving equine practice?\" Top factors bygraduation years. Fig. 12. Survey question: \"What is the primary or most im-portant factor that contributed to you leaving or consideringleaving equine practice?\" 176 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBUSINESS STRENGTHENING THE FOUNDATION OF YOUR PRACTICETraditionally, many equine practitioners worked 10-12-hour days, often 6 or 7 days a week in thebusy season. Many practices operated (and somestill do) with doctors as silos, holding the expectationthat each will attend their \"own\" clients' emergen-cies whenever they arise. In some practices, thework ethic is that all doctors should work until allthe calls of the day are completed, rather than hav-ing emergency service begin at some designatedtime. This lack of a \"hard\" stop to the scheduledday makes it very difcult for veterinarians to haveother activities, responsibilities, or priorities afterwork. This culture is particularly hard for womenveterinarians who have families. About 80% ofnew graduates are female now, and if they follow atraditional path through their undergraduate, doc-toral, and internship studies, they enter the profes-sion in their prime child-bearing years. Thisupends many budding equine veterinary careers. Many respondents to the survey wrote comments that showed a deep love for the profession but afrustration with the constraints of the lifestyle andnumber of work hours required. The long hoursrequired in the profession were the focus of onerespondent's comment: \"When people ask me whatmy hobbies are, I don't know what to say anymore.Sleeping? I used to have hobbies. My mom sug-gested the other day that we shop for summer shirtsat TJ Maxx. I didn't know why she would say that,why would I need a summer shirt, I will be work-ing. . . and wearing work shirts. I truly love my joband I love what I do. But it takes my whole life.\" Changing the culture of equine practice with regard to the number of work hours and the expec-tations of clients for 24/7/365 access to their veteri-narian is not an easy task, because it will requirehorse owners to be more flexible and accept bound-aries. Historically, many equine practitioners havemade themselves available for their clients' needs atall times, making their profession their rst prioritybefore family, health, or personal time. Manynewer veterinarians are unwilling to make thesesacrices, wanting to live lives more balanced be-tween work and other needs. This has created fric-tion between practitioners accustomed to the oldways and newer veterinarians searching for a freshapproach. Recent developments suggest that nd-ing a new paradigm will be necessary to retain vet-erinarians in equine practice. In order to effect change, veterinarians will need to explore their priorities and set appropriateboundaries on their work lives. This may be hav-ing an automatic reply to non-urgent texts, phonecalls, and e-mails that come in after hours or onweekends, saying that a response will be made whenthe ofce reopens. It could take the shape of havinga \"hard stop\" on regular workdays when a veterinar-ian has no emergency duty, with the doctor on-calltaking emergencies starting at 4 or 5 p.m. in theafternoon. Practices can experiment with 4-daywork weeks or compensatory days off after workinga weekend. Importantly, doctors can create spacefor time away from the practice by supporting theircolleagues' competence in their communication withtheir clients. Horse owners may prefer a certainprovider, but they need to learn to accept care withgratitude from whomever shows up. Increasing efciency in ambulatory practice can increase doctors' time away from the practice. Uti-lizing \"area days\" where certain geographical areasare assigned to certain days of the week for farmcalls can cut down on driving time. If urgent callsare required to other regions, additional fees wouldapply. Clients often appreciate being able to plan Fig. 13. Survey question: \"What is the primary or most important factor that contributed to you leaving or considering leaving equine practice?\" By graduation year. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 177BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRENGTHENING THE FOUNDATION OF YOUR PRACTICEin advance, knowing that the practice routinely is in the neighborhood on Tuesdays, for instance. Emergency on-call shifts are a signicant factor in the loss of veterinarians from equine practice, rank-ing second in this survey among all respondents.Said one, \"As I'm sure many people will say, theon-call and the hours (working every weekend dur-ing breeding season whether on call or not, stayinglate frequently, etc.) are major contributors in con-sidering leaving equine practice. When most of myfriends were vets this seemed normal, but now thatmany of my friends have non-vet jobs I am insanelyjealous of their ability to make denitive evening &weekend plans, have entire weekends off, and not berestricted to the on call radius and tethered to thephone. I enjoy emergencies but have come to hatebeing on call.\" Many practices, especially those that are solo or small, have formed emergency cooperatives to shareon-call duties. These loose confederations are morefrequent in some regions than others, depending onlocal competitive pressures. Clients quickly be-come accustomed to understanding that in an emer-gency they may need to see a veterinarian that theydon't know, and most seem to adjust readily. Thisis common in human medicine, as well as in emer-gency clinic settings for companion animals, andpeople seem to be increasingly understanding theneed for change in veterinary medicine. Emergency care is often needed less frequently for horses that have the benet of regular primary care.In order to encourage routine wellness care, somepractices offer a discount on robust emergency callfees for horses that receive vaccinations and otherprimary care through the rm. Others offer well-care programs for a menu of services to help ensurethat horses get the care they need. Education canalso decrease the need for emergency care by earlyrecognition or through prevention. Client semi-nars about equine management and health can alsohelp minimize urgent visits. The 2012 AAEP Owner Trainer survey demon- strated that horse owners highly value emergencycare delivered in the home setting. The 2017AVMA Pet Owner Demographic Study revealed that89% of horse owners consider their horses to be petsor family members, not livestock. Providing emer-gency care that addresses this emotional bond is ahuge opportunity to create client loyalty, and mostclients are willing to pay high fees to obtain suchcare. Some larger practices strategically hire asso-ciates to provide emergency care services for sur-rounding small practices in order to reap therevenue from this highly valued service. Mental health issues and stress were shown by the 2016 AVMA AAEP Economic study to be in-creased in veterinarians from more recent gradua-tion cohorts. This survey supports those ndings,with stress and mental health the third most com-mon reason for respondents to leave or considerleaving equine practice. Exhaustion, lack of per-sonal time, and frequent on-call shifts can all con-tribute to lack of personal wellness. Seeking a lifemore conducive to wellness may be a healthy andappropriate choice for many veterinarians that arestruggling personally. The challenge is to makeequine practice sustainable for those enteringthe profession and all those currently serving theequine industry. It is very important for equine veterinarians to avoid a victim mentality and take responsibility forshaping the life they wish to lead. Creation of apersonal mission and personal vision statement canhelp in this regard. Joining a peer networkinggroup (e.g., Decade One) can help doctors feel lessisolated as they discuss shared challenges and solu-tions. Other strategies for wellness include regularexercise, adequate sleep, good nutrition, and timefor family and friends. The thread of the higher compensation, shorter hours, and minimal emergency duty found in com-panion animal practice was woven into many re-spondents' comments in this survey but was not theprimary reason most equine veterinarians left orconsidered leaving the eld. Over all the respon-dents, low compensation was the fourth most com-monly cited as the primary factor. However, formore recent graduating classes, low salaries (oftenwell below those found in companion animal jobs)were the second most commonly cited reason forleaving the equine sector. As educational debt hasincreased in recent graduating classes, nancialconcerns are more prevalent, but according to theresults of this survey, they still remain less of astumbling block than the lifestyle of equine practice. Real mean debt of all 2018 graduates from US veterinary colleges, including those without debt,was $143,111, an increase from $133,086 in 2017and AAEP Equine Economic Survey indicatedthat equine practitioners must use much more oftheir annual compensation than (primarily compan-ion animal) AVMA members, when considering allrespondents (Fig. 14). The mean percentage ofcompensation used to service debt for 2006 to 2016graduates in equine practice was found to be 20%. 1 In 2018, about 30% of graduates who entered equine practice had no debt, compared with approx-imately 20% of graduates who entered companionanimal practice. Perhaps, inadvertently, theequine profession is now becoming more accessibleand attractive to those with more personal or famil-ial nancial resources. This could have a positiveeffect if these veterinarians feel less stressed by debtand will then remain in the profession. Con-versely, will those with robust nancial reserves besatised with life in equine practice as it currentlyexists, or will they carve out niches that require lesstime and effort? A healthy debt-to-income ratio (DIR) for profes- sionals is considered to be /H113491.4, and veterinarians in equine practice well exceed this measure. For 178 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRENGTHENING THE FOUNDATION OF YOUR PRACTICEgraduates of 2001 to 2016, the average DIR of vet- erinarians who worked full time in The DIR full-time equine practice was 3.2 in2017 and 4.7 in 2018. Clearly, this is not sustain-able, and changes must occur that allow for highercompensation for veterinarians entering equinepractice. Veterinary business management experts recom- mend that payment for effort as a veterinarian,including all costs of employment, should not exceed25% of the doctor's gross revenue produc-tion. Those costs of employment include benets,payroll taxes, Workman's compensation, profes-sional liability insurance, etc. Because compensa-tion follows revenue production, higher salaries willnecessarily need to follow higher revenue productionin order for practices to stay nancially healthy.One of the most effective ways to increase revenue isto increase the prices charged for services. If in-stead, practice owners utilize prot to increase sal-aries, they will decrease the value of their practices,and will receive less when they one day sell theirshares. Because practice owners receive practice prot in proportion to their percentage of share ownership, inaddition to compensation for their effort as veteri-narians, total compensation for those veterinariansthat are practice owners can well exceed that ofassociates. Many young equine veterinarians havestarted their own (often solo) practices as a result.A well-managed small ambulatory practice can bequite protable, allowing these new entrants to theequine veterinary eld to be more nancially suc-cessful. The positive aspect of greater nancialsuccess must be balanced by the added stresses ofmanaging a practice, providing emergency service,and bearing the burden of needed equipment pur-chases alone. Some newer graduates choose tohave niche practices that concentrate on areas ofservice that do not require general emergencyservice, such as dentistry or integrative therapy.These young practice owners also can set boundaries on their own terms and minimize accounts receiv-able by setting strict payment policies from thebeginning. Interestingly, only 6.3% chose having children as the primary reason for leaving or considering leav-ing the profession. This may reflect the fact thatbecause having a family is a natural and expectedpart of many if not most adults' lives, those aspectsof practice that do not allow for this normal lifephase may have been called out as the reason, notthe act of having children. Comments in the surveyand on the Facebook pages where this survey wasposted certainly highlighted the difculties of veter-inarians blending young families with equine prac-tice as it exists today. Said one doctor, \"I never considered leaving until having my daughter. I was all-in, gung-ho equine.And then she came along and the time, nancial,and quality of life sacrices I was making for theprivilege of working with horses were not just mysacrices anymore... I miss horses, but I love myfamily more.\" Said another, \"I'm one of the \"darkside\" converts... never thought I would be, but hereI am. I was a solid equine ambulatory vet for 11 years, then worked a handful of small-animaldays while on maternity leave with my second kid.Ended up making the switch. It has been good forme and my family, but I still struggle with my choicesome days. The decision was primarily made tohave better quality of life with two kids. I nowwork only 4 days a week, with no on-call, and earnconsiderably more. I struggle with the decision,partly from the sense that I gave up my passion, mydream career... I had to accept that doing what wasbest for myself and my family ended up being moreimportant than my job. I still consider myself a'horse vet doing small animal' even three yearslater.\" Although opportunities in other areas of the vet- erinary eld abound, those who have trained for anddreamed of a career in equine veterinary medicineoften have sadness about their transition. Dr. J. J.Vautier-Brown planned to be an equine surgeon andwas proud to be chosen for an internship at Roodand Riddle Equine Hospital several years ago.She described her training there as exceptional andperfect for her career trajectory. After a secondsurgical internship at the University of Georgia, shewas poised to apply for a surgical residency whenshe became pregnant. \"It is horribly crushing toinvest eight years of your life to be a surgeon, lovingevery minute of two intense internships, but feelinglike your dream has been crushed. But my son isthe biggest blessing of my life, and I wouldn't evertrade him for a residency.\" Dr. Vautier-Brown wor-ries that her educational loans are a burden to herfamily and says, \"I don't know how to balance mylove for my family, my career aspirations, and mynancial obligations. We don't leave the equine Fig. 14. Percentage of annual compensation used to service ed- ucational debt. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 179BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRENGTHENING THE FOUNDATION OF YOUR PRACTICEprofession because we want to\u2014we leave because we have no other choice!\" Equine veterinarians often work very hard to con- tinue to work in the traditional cultural mores evenas they become pregnant and have a young familydepending on them. They often feel diminished bytheir inability to be perfect in all their roles simul-taneously. This is stressful and may lead to de-pression. The exhaustion of early motherhood isundoubtedly an additional factor in these veterinar-ians' struggle. One young equine veterinarian described that \"Being a horse doctor was always my dream since Iwas 7 years old.\" After her internship, which shedescribed as an amazing experience, she beganequine practice at a 6-doctor rm. Although thepractice seemed progressive in its medicine, the cul-ture was not family friendly. Neither the staff norother associates had children, and there was littleteamwork. \"Every doctor was a silo, never sharingcases or treatments, or helping each other.\" Whenthis veterinarian became pregnant, she felt sheneeded to prove that she could do the work withoutaccommodations because of the culture. Sheworked until the day she delivered, including emer-gencies. As her rst child grew, she felt torn by thedemands of her job, saying, \"I felt I had to choosebetween the two and couldn't have both. I felt likeI wasn't doing a good job in either role.\" She re-cently began a full-time job at a companion animalpractice working 36 hours a week with no emer-gency on-call hours. Her compensation is 50%more than her previous equine position for twothirds as many hours. This talented veterinarianstated, \"I feel guilty, embarrassed, and like I don'tbelong in the equine vet tribe anymore. I took aspot at a prestigious practice for my internship, andnow I'm not using that training. I used to judgepeople for leaving because they couldn't hack it.And now that's me.\" Dr. Brittany Breidenbach describes the loss of veterinarians from the equine side as \"a huge crisis.\"After her internship, she felt exceptionally qualiedto start as an associate at a busy equine practice.She was 5 months' pregnant when she was hired forher rst position post internship and found thepractice owners to be very supportive and accommo-dating. As so many amazing women do, Dr. Bre-idenbach worked until her delivery, doing a fullschedule of dentals the day before she gave birth toher son. The birth was physically traumatic, andshe suffered femoral nerve paralysis which affectedher ability to walk and balance for nearly 6 months.Overwhelmed by stress and anxiety, the doctor feltenormous pressure \"to be exactly the same and notlet everyone down.\" When she returned to workafter 8 weeks, still not entirely healed, she wentright back into the on-call schedule despite her ex-haustion and physical decits, as she felt the need toprove her worth. In time, life normalized and shebegan talking with the owners about partnership inthe practice. But when she and her husband de-cided to have a second child, the physicality of theprofession began to weigh on her when she wasinjured tubing a choked horse while pregnant.Several weeks ago, Dr. Breidenbach started work ata companion animal hospital where she earns thesame compensation for half the hours, with no emer-gency duty, and a regular schedule of hours. Shelaments, \"I must accept being the stereotype, but I'mdying inside from the loss of my identity. Idreamed of being a horse vet since I was four yearsold, and I have to tell myself that I'm still me eventhough I'm not an equine practitioner. It isheartbreaking.\" 4. Conclusion These stories highlight the fact that even the \"bestin class\" are affected by our industry's longstandingworkplace traditions and outdated cultural more \u00b4s. In 2018, the AVMA reports that there were 3,142 USveterinary school graduates and that 42 (1.3%) tookan equine job at graduation. Another 146 enteredequine internships. 4Many AAEP members are over the age of 50 years, and many are approachingretirement. Recent numbers of jobs on the AAEPCareer Center have well exceeded 200. Our profes-sion cannot continue to stay strong into the comingdecades with the loss of exceptional talent that weare now experiencing. New paradigms must evolvethat allow our changing workforce to have the flex-ibility and support that they need while still keepingpractices nancially healthy. We must all contrib-ute to bringing about the changes that will keep theequine veterinary industry viable for the future.

Introduction Equine veterinarians consistently cite ethics as one of their primary issues of concerna. This concern is well justied. The horse industry currently facesintense public scrutiny following widespread public-ity in mass media about horse racing deaths. Thisattention could easily turn toward perceived mis-treatment or abuse of horses in other disciplines, oreven horse ownership in general. Public perceptionis crucial for maintaining a social license to operatein today's society, and without societal support horsesports are at risk of traveling the same path asBarnum and Bailey's circus, which closed down in2017 after 146 years of operation, in large part dueto protracted legal battles with animal rights orga- nizations over the use of elephants in their perfor-mances. 1Ethical decision making by equine veterinarians is not only important for maintaininga high standard of care, it is essential for maintain-ing public support of the horse industry. While bioethics is an important and well- developed eld in the human medical realm, formaltraining in ethics is sorely lacking in both veterinaryschool training and continuing education opportuni-ties for veterinarians. Discussions about ethics inequine practice to date have focused primarily oneducating practitioners about following guidelinesoutlined in the American Association of Equine Practitioners' (AAEP's) Ethical and ProfessionalGuidelines or in the American Veterinary MedicalAssociation's (AVMA) Principles of Veterinary Med-ical Ethics. However, these documents are limitedin scope. Although they do offer concrete solutionsto many specic ethical questions, they are less use-ful when practitioners are faced with more complexdilemmas. Equine veterinarians need better training and a more extensive toolbox in order to effectively ana-lyze and make decisions when faced with difcultethical dilemmas. This effort can begin by examin-ing well-established methods in bioethics used inhuman medicine and adapting them to meet theneeds of the veterinary profession. The four-principles approach to bioethics proposed by Beau-champ and Childress 2provides just such a practical framework that could prove useful for application toveterinary practice. 2. Discussion The Four-Principles Approach The basis of the four-principles approach introduced by Tom Beauchamp and James Childress2assumes a \"common morality,\" or set of moral standards uponwhich most reasonable people would agree. Few AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 181BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRENGTHENING THE FOUNDATION OF YOUR PRACTICE NOTESwould argue that outright killing of horses for insur- ance money is unethical (\"Thou shalt not kill\"), orthat it is unacceptable to alter medical records toconceal a chronic soundness problem on a horsebeing offered for sale (\"Thou shalt not lie\"). For lessblack-and-white the four principles of au-tonomy, benecence, nonmalecence, and justicecan be applied to help make a decision about themost ethical course of action. Autonomy In human medicine, the principle of autonomy pro- tects a patient's right to make decisions regardingtheir own care. It protects the right of a patient torefuse treatment as well as to make choices regard-ing diagnostic tests, participation in clinical trials,and therapeutic options offered by physicians andcaregivers. Rights related to patient autonomy are protected by protocols involving informed consent and docu-ments such as advanced directives. If a patient isdetermined to be incompetent to make decisions ontheir own behalf (including infants, very young chil-dren, or patients with conditions such as dementiaor a state of unconsciousness), a surrogate such as aparent or spouse is recognized. A surrogate is ex-pected to make decisions on behalf of the patientrst using a \"substituted judgment\" standard; thesurrogate chooses options based on what they be-lieve the patient would have wanted, even if thatoption may not be what the surrogate would prefer.For example, using a substituted judgment stan-dard, an adult child might opt to forego ventilatorsupport for a parent at the end of life based on thatparent's previously stated desires, even if the childis reluctant to make that decision knowing it mayhasten the death of their parent. When a substituted judgment standard is not possible due to lack of knowledge of what thepatient would have wanted, as is often the casewith infants or severely mentally disabled pa-tients, the \"best-interest\" standard is applied.Using the best-interest standard, the surrogate isexpected to make decisions based on what theybelieve would be best for the patient. For exam-ple, discontinuing futile treatment for a severelyimpaired newborn. In veterinary medicine, respect for autonomy be- comes more complicated to navigate. Patients areincapable of making any decisions on their own be-half, requiring that the practitioner immediatelyskip ahead to surrogate decision making. Not onlythat, it is impossible for a surrogate to apply a sub-stituted judgment standard as there is no way ofknowing what the horse's preferences would be.In all cases, the principle of autonomy in veterinarymedicine depends on a surrogate making healthcare decisions based on the best-interest standard. The next question one must ask is \"who is the appropriate surrogate?\" In equine practice, themedical decision making often falls to the trainer.Trainers of athletic horses are expected to producewinning results. Owners hope to win prize money,see the value of an investment horse increase, andproudly watch their children earn accolades in theshow ring. Faced with these expectations, trainerscommonly feel the pressure to get a horse \"back tothe ring,\" which can represent a conflict of interestwhen faced with soundness or health issues thatthreaten that possibility. Unless owners questionthe medication charges on their training bill or com-municate directly with the veterinarian, they areoften kept in the dark about their horse's health.This situation begs the question of whether ownerswould be more appropriate surrogates than trainers.Would owners be more inclined to make healthcare decisions for their horses based on the bestinterest standard if they were fully informed ofthe potential positive and negative consequencesof those decisions? Benecence and Nonmalecence The next two principles by ples are benecence (\"do harm\"). These two principles areoften considered together, as making an ethical de-cision often requires balancing them against oneanother. The goal is to determine whether the ben-ets of a chosen course of action outweigh the neg-atives. Cases in human medicine commonly testthese principles when questioning whether treat-ment that prolongs life in the face of pain and suf-fering should be pursued. Simple examples inequine practice would include making difcult deci-sions regarding euthanasia (does the positive effectof relieving suffering outweigh the negative of end-ing life?), or whether to pursue treatments such ascolic surgery (does the positive outcome of saving thehorse's life outweigh the negative impacts of pro-longed recovery, including nancial burdens to theowner?). The answers to these questions typicallyrequire consideration of a number of mitigating fac-tors including age and overall health of the horse,prognosis, and the owner's personal situation. Justice Finally, the principle of justice tells us that all pa- tients deserve equal treatment and addresses wide-spread challenges in health care disparities amongdifferent populations in human medicine. Raciallydriven health care disparities and availability ofhealth care in impoverished areas are examples ofproblems where the principle of justice is applied inthe human medical world. The principle of justice can be adapted to veteri- nary medicine when considering what treatment op-tions are offered to different categories of patients.Is referral offered to every patient that has the po-tential to benet from specialist expertise? Orshould patients be chosen for more advanced diag-nostics based on their perceived value? Effortssuch as the Equitarian Initiative to improve health 182 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRENGTHENING THE FOUNDATION OF YOUR PRACTICEcare for working equids in third-world countries are another example where the principle of justice isapplied in veterinary medicine. Case Examples The Black-and-White At the 2019 AAEP ethics session, a case was dis- cussed where a trainer in a large barn requestedthat a Dr. X, a young veterinarian newly employedby a large practice, dispense antibiotics to a newhorse with a nasal discharge that had never beenseen by the veterinarian or the practice. Thetrainer, a long-term client and large source of in-come to the practice, claimed that Dr. Y, the practiceowner, \"does this all the time,\" and was resistant toDr. X's request to perform an examination on thepatient. Dr. X felt torn between pleasing thetrainer and meeting the expectations of her newboss, and insisting on performing the examinationbefore dispensing the requested medication. The appropriate course of action in this case is clearly supported simply by adhering to the AVMA'sPrinciples of Veterinary Medical Ethics, whichclearly states, \"A veterinarian shall provide compe-tent veterinary medical clinical care under theterms of a veterinarian-client-patient relationship(VCPR).\" 3Particularly in light of current concerns regarding antibiotic stewardship, Dr. X would bemaking the most ethical decision by refusing to dis-pense the medications. One would hope that Dr. Ywould support this decision. The Gray Case #1. A mid-level junior hunter presents with an acute right front lameness 2 weeks prior to an important competition. The horse flexes off withdistal flexion of the limb, and the trainer requeststhat Dr. X perform a cofn-joint injection in an effortto restore the horse to soundness prior to the com-petition. The trainer at this large competition barntypically makes all of the medical decisions on be-half of the horse owners. Dr. X agrees that a cofn-joint injection will most likely help relievesymptoms, but has concerns that there could be asoft-tissue injury in the foot underlying the lame-ness. Dr. X recommends radiographs and possiblymagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to rule-out asoft-tissue injury prior to providing treatment.The trainer refuses further diagnostics. As outlined previously, under the principle of au- tonomy, the rst question in this case should be who is the appropriate surrogate, and are the decisionsbeing made in the best interest of the horse? If theowner of the horse were made aware of the potentialrisks of treating the horse and proceeding to thecompetition, would they choose to take the diagnos-tic steps recommended by the veterinarian? Theveterinarian could address this question by speak-ing directly to the owner of the horse regardingexam ndings and recommendations rather than relying on communication with the trainer. When balancing the principles of benecence and nonmalecence, does the benet of treating thejoint, relieving pain, and allowing the horse to go tothe show outweigh the risk that a career-endinginjury could result if an underlying soft-tissue injuryis present but unidentied? If the veterinarian de-termines that the risk of a more serious injury issignicant, this would help justify a decision to re-fuse treatment without the benet of furtherdiagnostics. Finally, under the principle of justice, if this horse were a young Grand Prix jumper with potential forinternational success instead of an older juniorhunter, would the decision change? The veterinar-ian should take care to offer the same level of carefor every horse. Case #2. An older amateur dressage horse has had 3 colic episodes during the past month. All have been uncomplicated and resolved with a single doseof flunixin meglumine administered by the trainer,who communicated with the veterinarian over thephone. After the third episode, the trainer requeststhat the veterinarian prescribe an omeprazole/rani-tidine powder from a compounding pharmacy that the trainer believes he has had good luck with in\"ulcery horses.\" The veterinarian suggests thatgastroscopy would be the best next step in order tomake a denitive diagnosis, and that treatment rec-ommendations would depend on the results. Fur-thermore, the veterinarian informs the trainer thatcompounded omeprazole/ranitidine products are notreliably effective for treating ulcers. The trainerrefuses the gastroscopy and persists in demandingthe prescription. Once again, the rst question in this case is whether the trainer is the appropriate surrogatedecision maker for this horse. If informed aboutthe value of gastroscopy for making a diagnosis anddistinguishing between squamous and glandular ul-cers for the purposes of determining the best courseof treatment, the owner of the horse might make adifferent decision. In addition, the owner, who willbe nancially responsible for the medications,should have the option of choosing whether to treatthe horse with an effective medication that may bemore expensive in place of the unreliable productrequested by the trainer. The veterinarian shouldcommunicate directly with the owner rather thanrelying on the decisions of the trainer. What happens if the owner is involved in the decision-making process and aligns with the train-er's request for compounded omeprazole/ranitidinewithout gastroscopy? Adherence to the principle ofnonmalecence would guide the veterinarian to re-fuse this prescription request, as treating with anineffective medication could cause harm to thehorse. This should outweigh the benet of makingthe trainer and owner happy. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 183BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRENGTHENING THE FOUNDATION OF YOUR PRACTICEFinally, the request for a less effective medica- tion because of cost raises the question of justice. Would the owner or trainer of a successful interna-tional Grand Prix horse choose to treat that horsedifferently? Case #3. A middle-aged pony hunter is reported to be drinking and urinating more than normal. Rou- tine lab work indicates that the pony has renal in-sufciency. The pony competes heavily, and thebarn program includes administration of phenylbu-tazone every night during competitions for everyhorse. Veterinarians dispense medications totrainers in bulk, and owners see only a \"medication\"charge on their monthly bills. Could this situation have been averted if the owner had been acting as the surrogate decisionmaker for the pony instead of the trainer? If theowner were aware that the pony was being admin-istered medications on a regular basis, and thatthose medications could have adverse side effectssuch as renal damage, would they have opted to con-tinue daily administration? Alternatively, wouldthey have sought out other ways to manage the pony'slong-term soundness such as pursuit of diagnosticsthat might have led to targeted treatments? Veteri-narians should take care to establish relationships andcommunicate with horse owners directly regardingroutine care decisions. In terms of benevolence vs nonmalecence, should the veterinarian continue to support the trainer'sroutine administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) by dispensing large quantities of medications? Does the benet ofproviding pain relief to older campaigners andkeeping trainers happy outweigh the risk of doingharm to a horse that might suffer serious sideeffects or that would be better served with diag-nostics? The veterinarian can adhere to the prin-ciple of nonmalecence by dispensing medicationsonly to specic horses based on those horse's indi-vidual circumstances. Finally, considering justice, how does the prac- tice of routine administration of medications tonational level competition horses compare withthe medication controls in place for horsescompeting internationally? Should internation-al-level competition horses be treated differently? 3. Conclusion Equine veterinarians face ethical dilemmas everyday. Some are easy to recognize and answer, oth-ers are much less clear. Everyday issues that maynot even be identied as problems can raise ethicalquestions, and society is watching the equine indus-try. The time is now to begin developing methodsand formalizing education in ethics for veterinari-ans. This can begin by looking at the different the-ories and methods that have been established fordecades in the eld of human bioethics.

They share many characteristics: theybuy more, they are easier to work with, they paytheir bills on time, and they tend to refer new cli-ents. Having more loyal clients, stands to reasonthat businesses would grow and be more protable.Not only do loyal clients spend more but they alsorefer more new clients, which reduces the cost to get new clients. Studies show that clients with highlevels of customer loyalty increase sales more than2.5 times others in comparable industries and have2 to 5 times more protability over a 10-year period a. The problem is how can the loyalty of clients bemeasured? Veterinary practices tend to send sur-veys to their clients that are focused on customersatisfaction, the quality of service they received, andthe cleanliness of their facility. These surveys giveresults that are not quantiable. The answers areeither descriptive or vague. It is nice to know thata facility is clean, and the receptionist greeted cli-ents warmly, but there is nothing measurable thatpractice owners and managers can use to improvethe business or give them a score of how loyal theirclients are.There is a broadly used client survey called the Net Promoter Score (NPS) b. It is a system used to measure client loyalty by the majority of Fortune 500 companies, including Costco, Apple, Amazon,and Enterprise c. The latter value the score so much that they use it as the basis for bonuses andpromotions at each rental car location. Solution The basic premise of the NPS is that only one ques-tion needs to be asked to determine client loyalty\u2014how likely is it that one would recommend acompany/product/service to a friend or colleague?A recommendation to a friend or a colleague is thehighest form of support for a company because theirreputation is on the line. Nobody would recom-mend a terrible company to a friend or family mem-ber. This is why online reviews are so popular.When planning a vacation, it is wise to scour onlinetravel sites to evaluate the best restaurants or at-tractions at the destination. Imagine buying some-thing on Amazon without reading a review of theproduct rst. The NPS is measured from 0 to 10, with 0 sug- gesting \"not very likely\" and 10 indicating thatsomeone recommend company. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 185BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRENGTHENING THE FOUNDATION OF YOUR PRACTICE NOTESOn this scale, there are three categories of results: Promoters scorea9o r1 0a n dexhibit all of thepositive behaviors of a very loyal client. Passivesgive a score of 7 or 8 and are on the fence. They likethe company a lot but are open to other opportuni-ties. Detractors score from 0 to 6 and, dependingon how low a score they give, are actively looking touse another company. These are the people thatwill bad mouth businesses, argue over prices, or dothe minimal required for their pets. The NPS isdetermined by subtracting the percentage of re-sponses that are detractors from the those that arepromoters. This means scores can range from/H11002100 to 100. 2. Results The author's 3-location practice has been consis-tently sending the survey via an online survey plat-form to clients on a monthly basis for the past 2years and intermittently for the previous 10 years.In 2018, practice A had a score of 84%, and practicesB and C shared a score of 73%. In 2019, practice Aincreased their score to 85%, practice B rose to 80%,and Practice C increased their score by 1% to 74%. A couple of open-ended questions asking why someone scored 9 or above and why someone scored6 or below were added. For those offering a lowscore they were asked if they would supply theirname and contact information so the practice coulddiscuss where it had failed. Some of the typical comments that were received are listed below. Positive Peace of mind knowing best possible diagnosis,prognosis, and treatment will be offered. Very good at communicating with clients sothey can make informed decisions. Have the best interest in the horse and client. Knowledgeable, on time, and reliable. Great service from vets, techs, and ofce staff. Availability of great equipment to be able todiagnose the problem right away. Explains everything very well, from procedureto next steps. Excellent care and follow up. Areas for Improvement Cost. If a new vet examines a horse, they shouldknow the history and not ask the client for it. Send out invoices quicker. Saturday or weekend appointments. Easy access to the same vet. Reminders on when vaccinations are due andfollow up when booster or other follow ups aredue or recommended. Better quoting. Finally, a 33% response rate was typicallyreceived, far higher than the 10% of previous client satisfaction surveys. 3. Discussion The survey was rst used during the Great Reces-sion, and the high scores were very comforting dur-ing that scary time. Positive results providedcondence that the practice's clients were very loyaland would not flee for cheaper alternatives at therst opportunity. This high level of loyalty con-rmed another benet discussed by the authors ofthe original study on the NPS survey: good prots.They concluded that prots in a company that has ahigh NPS score are sustainable and will not easilyshrink in the face of new competitors or an economicdownturn. The comments were valuable because of the spe- cic reasons people gave for their score. Trendswere identied within a practice and between thepractices on areas where performance was good andneeded improvement. For example, comments overa couple of months identied that quoting for ser-vices needed to be improved. The author's practicewas able to take immediate action to resolve thatshortcoming and were rewarded with an absence ofcomments on the subject in successive surveys. There are challenges using the NPS survey in that sending the survey to every person that uses thepractice could become annoying because some cli-ents have frequent visits. So it's better to lterclient visits and only send the survey every 6months to frequent clients. Getting client visit in-formation is not easy with all practice managementsoftware programs, so it may be easier to nd some-one who is very comfortable using spreadsheets tomodify this information to send the survey in anappropriate manner. There is also not an industry standard for the NPS for practices to use for benchmarking purposes. Until a standard is established, practices should usethe survey to compare against themselves. Using the NPS has given the author's practice a consistent quantiable tool to appreciate the level ofclient loyalty. Over some months, the numbershave gone down at times, which serves as a wake upcall from complacency to look at why the score wasdeclining. The practice was able to look at the com-ments and make adjustments. Loyal clients help keep businesses growing and protable. The NPS is a tool validated by numer-ous companies in many surveys and is easily appli-cable to veterinary practices. Having a simple toolthat uses one question is invaluable to help veteri-narian practice owners and managers understandtheir level of client loyalty, which can make a hugedifference on the nancial health of a practice andhelp understand what needs to be done to continuestrong growth. 186 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRENGTHENING THE FOUNDATION OF YOUR PRACTICEAcknowledgments Mike Pownall is a partner in McKee-Pownall Equine Services and is also a partner of Oculus InsightsLLP that provides the Net Promoter Score Survey asa service to their clients.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 THE FOUNDATION OF YOUR PRACTICEReview of Equine Hospital Design Techniques for Controlling Infectious Disease Lucas Pantaleon, DVM, MS, DACVIM, MBA; and Heather E. Lewis, AIA, NCARB Hospital design is a key component of effective infection control prevention and biosecurity plans. Understanding the ways diseases spread must be part of the hospital planning. Veter-inarians should collaborate with architects to design hospitals that are functional and effectivein reducing the chances for hospital infections. AAEP. 1. Introduction Infectious pathogens are a serious threat to humans and animals. In human medicine, the improve-ments in medicine, public health, and social stan-dards have led to a paradoxical increase in exposureand susceptibility to pathogens. 1In veterinary medicine, increased knowledge and specializationhas allowed veterinarians to improve the way ani-mals are treated and cared for at equine hospitals.However, hospitalized horses are at a higher risk ofbeing infected by a healthcare-associated infection.Thus, preventing infectious diseases must be a keycomponent for providing the highest quality of careto hospitalized horses. Protecting the care teamfrom acquiring zoonotic diseases is also of para-mount importance when developing and implement-ing a disease-prevention plan. To implement effective measures for controlling the spread of disease, one must understand modes of transmission. 2This paper concentrates on 3 modes of disease transmission in equine veterinary facili-ties: fomite, oral, and aerosol. The paper also cov- ers the basics of cleaning and disinfection. Linkinghospital design with ways to minimize diseasetransmission creates a safer environment for pa-tients and allows practices to more easily managebiological risk and reinforce their infection control,prevention, and biosecurity (ICPB) protocols. This review paper presumes correlation between built environments for humans, companion animals,and equids because classes of pathogens and infec-tion control protocols share many commonalities be-tween species. It is accepted that there are alsosome critical differences between equine facilitiesand those for other animals, including but not lim-ited to, acceptable methods for cleaning, readilyavailable materials and nishes, and unique opera-tional requirements. 2. Fomites are inanimate objects (i.e., twitches, diag- nostic equipment, shoes, etc.) that if contaminated 188 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRENGTHENING THE FOUNDATION OF YOUR PRACTICE NOTESand in contact with a susceptible host, are capable of spreading disease. A common pathogen transmit-ted via contaminated fomites is Salmonella spp. 2 Fomite transmission is an important area of focusbecause it involves many design and operationalchoices. Hand Hygiene Every major healthcare agency, human and animal,as well as myriad human hospital groups such asthe Mayo Clinic, emphasize the critical importanceof hand hygiene in controlling the spread of infec-tious disease. Nevertheless, many of the nuanceddesign decisions regarding hand hygiene are notcommonly understood. Below are some of the im-portant concepts for incorporating effective hand hy-giene into an equine hospital design: Hand washing. Hand sanitizers can be used when hand washing is not available. However,alcohol sanitizers are not effective against non-enveloped viruses or bacterial spores. 3Fur- thermore, soiled hands will render handsanitizers ineffective. 4Proper hand washing with soap and water is the best protocol for hy-giene regardless of the circumstance because itremoves soil and microorganisms. Paper towels versus hand dryers. Some busi- nesses choose to put in hand dryers to reducewaste from paper towels. However, papertowels are best for two reasons. First, themechanical action of drying hands makes themcleaner and drier, and second, hand dryersaerosolize droplets and spray them against ad-jacent surfaces. 5 Sink placement. Make hand washing easy. If it is not easy, compliance will be low. In-stall hand wash sinks with soap dispensersaround critical areas. Transmission of dis-eases becomes more likely if an animal careteam member touches one or more door han-dles in between the area where his or herhands got soiled and the nearest sink. Sink design. Sink design should be an impor- tant part of ICPB design protocols. Usetouchless faucets: these are readily availablefor health care applications and work well for all locations, including surgery scrub-bing. Ensure the faucet is directed in a waythat allows the sink to contain splashing wa-ter. Several human hospital infection out-breaks have been linked to sinks that splashwater from the drains, thereby recontaminat-ing hands. 6As an example of proper design, a scrub sink is often manufactured with a slop-ing front face, which allows water to hit theinterior of the sink at an obtuse angle, direct-ing it safely to the bottom of the basin.Separate Patients and Patient Care Items Based on Risk Separating patients based on risk is a common prac- tice for managing potential disease outbreak in afacility. For example, inpatients need to be sepa-rated from outpatients. High-risk patients such asmare and foal, ICU patients, or patients with colicshould be hospitalized in separate areas. Horseswith fever and leukopenia should be hospitalized inisolation. High-risk patients should have their own groom- ing, care, feeding, and cleaning items. 7These items should be stored in individual prep areas thatare assigned to individual stalls. In facilities withlarger isolation barns, it is not unusual to designateeach stall prep area with its own set of cleanablebooties that are used by staff for caring for that oneparticular horse throughout its stay. Provide infra-structure such as wall-mounted hangers to storeitems off the floor or where they will be out of theway for cleaning. Design Cleaning Infrastructure with Fomites in Mind As mentioned above, improperly designed sinkscould facilitate disease spread by splashing and con-taminating surrounding areas. Hoses can havesimilar problems. Hoses are commonly draggedacross the floors in the hospital. In this way, a hosecould become a highly contaminated fomite, allow-ing for disease dissemination across the hospital.Below are some design considerations that reducethis problem: For high-risk patients, provide a hose bib ineach individual patient prep area. Hang thehose on the wall above each hose bib. Thisway, each hose bib and hose are separatedbetween patients, just as are all other patientcare items. For common-use areas such as corridors, pro-vide one of the following:\u2014Ceiling or high wall-mounted hose reel tominimize the hose dragging on the floor, and toallow the hose to be stored off the floor whennot in use.\u2014Some animal care facilities are plumbedwith integral cleaning systems that featureboth remote power and remote disinfectant in-jection. Hoses are plugged into remote out-lets. In addition to reducing the dragging ofhoses, integral cleaning systems can be ad-justed to various chemical dilution ratios tomatch infection risk. While they may seem tobe ideal, cleaning systems require mainte-nance, are very expensive compared with stan-dard hose reels, and they must be designed tobe compatible with the disinfectant to be used.For example, cleaning systems utilizing accel-erated hydrogen peroxide require stainlesssteel or cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) pipingwith /H11408Vol. 66 189BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRENGTHENING THE FOUNDATION OF YOUR PRACTICE3. Oral Transmission Oral transmission involves the ingestion of patho- gens from contaminated food, water, or licking sur-faces. The contamination of the environment withexudates, feces, urine, or saliva containing an infec-tious dose of a pathogen can infect susceptible hosts.Salmonella spp. and Clostridium spp. are examples of orally transmitted diseases. 2 Oral transmission prevention follows similar guidelines as for fomite transmission, but in addi-tion, special attention is paid to the quality of ma-terials and nishes within the environment,cleaning systems, and manure disposal. Nonporous Materials and Systems It is more difcult to design and construct non-porous materials and surfaces than it might seem tobe. Numerous disease outbreaks have been corre-lated with environments that are either improperlycleaned or are impossible to clean. For example,Salmonella spp. can persist on surfaces for long periods and is a notorious cause of nosocomial infec-tions in equine hospitals. 8The following materials are acceptable depending on the circumstance: Seamless flooring.\u2014For low-cost installations in lower-riskspaces such as healthy horse treatment roomsin smaller hospitals, rubber mats may be in-stalled if they are manufactured from virginrubber (as opposed to recycled rubber which isporous), are thoroughly adhered to each otherwith a high-performance, flexible joint sealant,and are sealed to the slab below. Loose rub-ber mats are unacceptable because they cantrap moisture and encourage biolms to form.\u2014For highest-quality flooring installations,utilize poured equine floors. These are man-ufactured from recycled rubber (which is po-rous) and then sealed with polyurethanebinders. Because the installation of a pouredfloor depends on many factors from the condi-tion and preparation of the underlying slab tothe skill of the installation crew, specic man-ufacturers are not listed here. Nevertheless,it is important to specify products from themost reputable companies for the equine mar-ket. The benets of properly installed pouredfloors include the following: A longer-lasting solution. A complete seal from wall to wall, and arounddrains. The ability to provide a seamless joint betweenthe floor and wall.\u2014The most sanitary design for the joint be-tween the floor and wall is a cove (rounded)prole, with the flooring continuing onto thewall surface several inches. 9Industrial Coatings for Walls Most equine facility medical areas are constructed of concrete block and sealed with various coatings,most of which are ineffective and require frequentrecoating. Anecdotal evidence suggests that thebest long-term option is a cementitious block llerthat lls the concrete pores, followed by two coats ofan industrial marine coating developed to coat metalships at sea. A system like this can remain intacton the walls over the lifetime of an equine hospitalfacility and decrease the chance for infectious dis-ease to remain in the environment, because thepores in the wall are sealed, leaving an easy-to-clean-and-disinfect surface. Match the Materials with the Cleaning Protocol One of the problems that facilities have is that in-stalled materials degrade over time in the presenceof water and disinfectants. Degraded materials aremore likely to become porous and allow biolms toform. 9Be aware of the effect of the cleaning and disinfection protocols on materials and select mate-rials that can withstand them. Below are someprinciples to consider: Cleaners and disinfectants should always bediluted properly. Using more disinfectantthan necessary is not only expensive, it is in-effective. Many surfaces repopulate them-selves with pre-cleaning microbial colonieswithin a few hours of cleaning, regardless ofthe vigor of the cleaning efforts. 9 Bleach degrades all nishes but especiallysteel. Exposed steel should ideally be galva-nized and painted with a high-performancecoating such as a urethane. Fiberglass mandoors hold up better than their steelcounterparts. Accelerated hydrogen peroxide has less effecton materials, but if not properly diluted, itdegrades some lower-quality metals, as well asconcrete and epoxy coatings. If the hospitalplans to use poured epoxy floors for the clean-able areas where horses are anesthetized andare therefore not standing on the floors (anexample is surgery), then specify a urethane-based, poured-floor coating instead, whichwithstands peroxide-based cleaning agents. Utilize moisture-resistant cabinetry in wet/dryzones such as medical barn nursing stations orin treatment rooms. Suitable products in-clude stainless steel or powder-coated metalcasework and plastic medical casework madeby companies such as Midmark. Manure Management Control of oral transmission requires design forcareful manure handling. The hospital shouldhave a designated, restricted area for containmentof contaminated manure. The path to this contam-inated manure storage should be disconnected from 190 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRENGTHENING THE FOUNDATION OF YOUR PRACTICEprimary healthy horse circulation paths. Place the containment dumpster downwind of all facilities.Plan trafc flow so that the containment dumpsteris the last to be picked up with the trash service. 4. Aerosol Transmission Aerosolized particles can be inhaled, deposited on mu-cus membranes or contaminate surfaces. Pathogenstransmitted via this route include influenza or equineherpesvirus-1. 2Methods for management of these diseases include physical isolation and careful air sys-tem design. Note that diseases that spread via aero-solized particles also spread via other means such asfomite transmission, and so all previously discussedpractices apply. Isolation Barns Infectious disease can spread via fomites or aero-sol over long distances. For example, equine in-fluenza virus spreads effectively as an aerosol overdistances up to 50 yards. 10Isolation facilities for horses should be placed at a distance from otherbuildings on the site. While recommendationsvary, a minimum of 60 feet is a useful guideline tominimize spreading of infectious diseases. Con-trolling the spread of diseases via aerosols withinthe isolation building requires several steps, in-cluding the following: Providing a solid barrier between patients andbetween patients and the human access areas.Windows are acceptable for looking into stallsbut maintain a solid front on the stalls. Providing direct exhaust for each equine isola-tion stall. This ensures separated ventilationand negative pressure. The largest hospitalsgo to great lengths to ensure that ventilationsystems are highly cleanable so they may beregularly purged of reservoirs of microbes. Differentially pressurize the isolation stalls,which should be negative, to the surroundingspaces, which should act as buffers, to preventair from isolated patients from flooding intothe surrounding areas. Consider properly designed air treatment sys-tems within the isolation facility. These sys-tems are not intended to replace proper airhandling and exhaust systems, but to treat airthat is in the surrounding partial-recirculatedzones, such as nursing stations. The most ef-fective systems utilize a combination of ltra-tion and ultraviolet (UV) light and can beeffective in eliminating 90% or more of aero-solized viruses and bacteria in laboratoryconditions. a Methods for Ventilating Hospitals Outside of the Isolation Zone Equine hospitals tend to be less rigorously condi- tioned and ventilated than their small-animal hos-pital counterparts. Some ideas, however, shouldalways be implemented to reduce the risk of aerosoltransmission and for basic healthy indoor air: Surgery rooms should be positively pressur-ized and If using a lter likethis, ensure the engineer who is designing theHVAC system is accounting for the pressuredrop across the lter. HEPA lters are un-necessary for most hospitals, except ones withvery heavy orthopedic caseloads. Ventilate conditioned medical areas at least to8 to10 air changes per hour and 40% to 60%outside air. Medical barns can be vented atfour to six air changes per hour and may notneed to condition the air except in very hot orcold weather. Control and reduce humidity. Humidity hasa tremendous impact on the growth of micro-organisms in the built environment. Humid-ity should not exceed 60%, which is the levelpast which American Society of Heating,Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers(ASHRAE) deems the growth of molds on sur-faces to be inevitable. 9 5. Cleaning and Disinfection Cleaning is dened as the removal of visible soil(e.g., organic and inorganic material) from objectsand surfaces. Normally it is accomplished man-ually or mechanically using water with detergentsor enzymatic products. Thorough cleaning is es-sential before disinfection because inorganic andorganic materials that remain on the surfaces inter-fere with the effectiveness of these processes. 11 Cleaning is a very important step that assures theremoval of organic and inorganic materials fromsurfaces and devices, hence allowing for maximaldisinfection efcacy. 11The microbicidal efcacy of disinfectants is inversely proportional to the degreeof soiling on the targeted surface. 12It has been shown that experimentally, cleaning can eliminateapproximately 90% of bacteria on concrete surfaces,hence the importance of physically removing patho-gens from surfaces prior to disinfection. 13 Disinfection describes a process that eliminates many or all pathogenic microorganisms, exceptspores, on inanimate objects. 11Objects and sur- faces are normally disinfected with liquid chemi-cals. 11There are several factors that affect the efcacy of disinfectants such as prior cleaning, or-ganic and inorganic load, type and level of microbialcontamination, concentration and contact time ofthe disinfectant, physical nature of the object, pres-ence of biolm, and temperature and pH of the dis-infection process. 11 It is well established that environmental contam- ination leads to hospital-associated infections.Therefore, implementing a well-designed disinfec-tion reduces the pathogens AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 191BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: STRENGTHENING THE FOUNDATION OF YOUR PRACTICEfrom environmental surfaces.14,15A recent study demonstrated that the daily use of a cleaner disin- fectant wipe on all patient areas produced asignicant methicillin-resistant Staph- housekeepingcompliance was at least 80% or greater. 16This ex- ample illustrates that education, training, and feed-back can help improve results and provide a moresuccessful infection-control plan. Veterinarians and animal caregivers need to un- derstand the role that disinfectants play when de-veloping an ICPB plan. Disinfectants should notjust be selected based on cost or tradition, but onsafety and efcacy, since the use of the wrong for-mulation for an inappropriate contact time gener-ates a false sense of security, which in turn risks thespread of pathogenic organisms over a wider areaduring the disinfection process. Therefore, regard-less of all other design considerations and opera-tional protocols, the hospital must use disinfectantsproperly and clean effectively to maintain a safeenvironment for horses and humans. 6. Discussion The following are the four key factors that influencehow disease spreads in a hospital: The patient population. The colonized or in- fected patient plays a key part in contamina-tion of environmental surfaces and fomites. The operations. If personnel are not following ICPB practices such as maintaining hand hy-giene and footwear cleanliness, these problemscan aid with the dissemination of environmen-tal pathogens. The design. Poor hospital design, such as lack of stall drains or porous stall walls, makethe implementation of ICPB protocols such ascleaning and disinfection unrealistic or cum-bersome, hence decreasing the chance for teamadoption and success. Cleaning and disinfection. Proper cleaning and disinfection as a key part of an ICPBprotocol. Maintaining a comfortable, clean, and disinfectedenvironment is critical for the health and welfare ofpatients visiting the veterinary hospital, as well asfor the animal care team's safety and wellbeing.A hospital that looks sanitary and smells clean alsoreflects well on the practice and fosters a profes-sional impression for clients. In veterinary hospitals, nosocomial infections have a negative impact on patient outcomes andclient experience. Infectious disease outbreakshave a negative effect for hospital operations bynegatively affecting revenue, client condence,public image, and staff morale. 17Therefore, the goals of properly implemented ICPB protocols areto reduce infection rates, morbidity and mortality,to improve personnel safety, and to reduce costs.A properly designed hospital makes achievingthese goals easier. In a recent consensus statement, it was concluded that veterinarians and managers need to be awarethat there is a recognizable standard of care withregard to infection control, meaning that mea-sures geared toward minimizing the spread of con-tagious infectious diseases and education must bepart of the care provided by veterinarians to theirpatients and clients. Not meeting these stan-dards constitutes malpractice and represents afailure to meet the ethical responsibilities to pa-tients and clients. 18,19 Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Authors have adhered to the Principles of Veter- inary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Introduction There are important evolutionary differences be- tween prey and predator animals.1Horses as a precocious species are born with a more developedbrain and fully functional vision and hearing thanaltricious species, such as humans. Although braindevelopment continues after birth, the cerebellarlayers in prey animals, such as the neonatal foal, arealready distinct histologically cell migra- continues to period (Fig.1). Cerebellar development and myelination invarious parts of the nervous system explain the\"bouncy\" gait typical of neonatal foals. Thisbouncy gait becomes less apparent as the foal ma- tures. Neonatal foals are not just little adulthorses, and major physiological and neurologicaldifferences exist compared to older foals and adult horses. 2-5Therefore, recognition of what is normal according to age is essential. Alertness, responseto the environment, and movement are different inutero, during birth, and in extra-uterine life. Foalsrespond and move in utero but not to the extent thatis seen in extra uterine life. In the birth canal, foals are in a drowsy state and become minimallyresponsive and movement is depressed. Duringthe rst few hours of extra uterine life, importantmilestones must occur for successful functioning andsurvival of the neonatal foal. This rapid transitionis remarkable (Fig. 2). As prey animals, horsesmust develop a menace response relatively quicklyafter birth (within 7 to 10 days) compared to preda-tors (several weeks). Many neonatal diseases present with similar clin- ical signs, such as lethargy, recumbence, weakness,and reduced or lack of suckle reflex, among others.These signs could be caused by systemic or neuro-logic disease, or both. Therefore, a complete thor- ough history must be obtained, followed by acomprehensive physical examination to determine overall health status. Do not forget signalment(breed, sex, and age) because there are disordersthat can be seen in specic breeds. A few examplesinclude juvenile epilepsy and lavender foal syn-drome in Egyptian Arabian foals. These two disor-ders are and genotypically different. 194 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: NEONATOLOGY NOTESThe principles on how to perform the neurologic examination are the same across species. The neu- rologic examination in foals can be done concurrently with the physical examination. Neurologic assess-ment must include the evaluation of behavior, state ofconsciousness, cranial nerves, posture and posturalreactions, segmental (spinal) reflexes, palpation, andgait evaluation. The tools required for the examina-tion are vision (lots of observation), touch (palpation),and listening. The main goal of the neurologic exam-ination is to determine if the foal is normal or abnor-mal. The second goal of the examination is todetermine the anatomical location of the decitswithin the nervous system and, nally, to considerpossible causes of disease. It is critical to rule outother disorders that might present with similar signs,especially in the neonatal foal (e.g., obtundation, 2. Neurologic Examination in Neonatal Foals The most important component in performing theneurologic examination in foals is the practitioner'ssenses for observation, listening, and palpation;then, a light source to examine the eyes (dazzlereflex [subcortical reflex to bright light] and pupil-lary light reflexes) and ears; and needle holders,forceps, or a pleximeter to check for segmental (spi-nal) reflexes. Know what is normal and do morethan one examination. Once more, observation isparamount. The neurologic status of the normalneonatal foal goes through a transition from in uteroto extra utero life. The APGAR (appearance, pulse,grimace, activity, respiration) score developed forthe assessment of neonates in the post-foaling pe-riod (1 minute post-foaling) consists of the followingvariables: 1. Heart rate (normal: regular, /H1135060 beats abnor- mal if blue, bright red, or yellow). 4. Muscle tone (normal: strong enough to be in sternal recumbency). 5. Responsiveness. A. Nasal stimulation (expected response: strong grimace, sneeze). B. Ear tickle (expected response: head shake). C. Back scratch (expected response: attempts to stand). Fig. 1. Cerebellum. Note the 3 layers of the cerebellum (molecular [M], purkinje [P], and granular [G]) organized in the neonatal foal are similar to the adult cerebellar layers. Cell migration and organization continue in the neonatal period. Fig. 2. Note this 32-hour-old Quarter Horse colt during move-ment following his mother (not shown), fully functional andcoordinated. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 195IN-DEPTH: NEONATOLOGYThis evaluation can be repeated at 5 and 15 minutes post-foaling to determine if veterinary interventionis needed. Important milestones include time tosternal recumbency (1-2 minutes), alertness andresponsiveness to external (tactile, visual, and audi-tory) stimuli (within 5 minutes), suckle reflex pres-ent (within the rst 20 minutes), vocalizing inresponse to the dam's nickering (within 30 minutes),time to stand (60 minutes [longer than 2 hours isconsidered abnormal]), and time to nurse (2 hours[longer than 3 hours is abnormal]) post-birth. Theauthor performs neurologic evaluation concurrentlywith the physical examination in neonatal foals.Similarly, multiple assessments of the neurologicstatus can be done concurrently with physical exam-ination. The examination consists of evaluatingthe neurologic status while the foal is at rest (static)and during movement (dynamic) if ambulatory.The examination could be divided in the following: 1. Behavior and mentation A. Behavior (examples of decits): a. Aberrant vocalization (e.g., barking or honking sounds). b. Walking compulsively. c. Lack of mare bonding. d. Sleeping behavior while standing. Neo- natal foals must lay down to sleep(drowsy to slow wave sleep and rapideye movement sleep); this behaviorchanges as the foal matures. (Fig. 3): a. Normal, bright, alert, responsive.b. Obtunded. This could range from mild to moderate to severe obtundation: fromstanding quietly to recumbent but re-sponsive to physical stimulus (tactile,auditory, visual). In this state, foalsshould always respond to non-painfulstimulus.c. Stuporous. Recumbent, only responsive to profoundly painful stimulus and onlywhile this stimulus is applied. d. Comatose. Not responsive at all, in- cluding to profoundly painful stimulus. 2. Cranial nerves and responses, reactions, and reflexes.A. Afferent, central, and efferent pathways must be intact for proper function. B. These can be evaluated individually (I through XII) or grouped into functions(e.g., olfaction [I], vision [II], menace re-sponse [II, neck, trunk, reactions (i.e., proprioceptive posi- reflexes. pelvic limb reflexes D. Anal and perineal 6. Palpation A. Muscle asymmetryB. Painful areas 7. Gait evaluation A. Consider age of foal (bouncy in neonates)B. Consider breed for specic gait 8. Nociception A. Evaluate for pain perception (conscious perception /H11005cerebrocortical acknowledg- ment of pain) only in foals with no appar-ent voluntary movement. B. Reflexive movement while applying a painful stimulus does not equal a con-scious response. The determination of mentation, behavior, and pos-ture can be done as the history is being taken or asthe foal is being examined. States of consciousnessinclude bright, alert and responsive, and obtunded, Fig. 3. States of consciousness (brainstem): and comatose (Fig. 3). Normal behavior is a bright, alert foal that is responsive to the envi-ronment; who has mare attachment; is udder seek-ing and nursing, curious of the environment; andwho sleeps. Head posture in neonatal foals has a\"flexed\" appearance at the atlanto-occipital jointcompared to adults, and their stance is wide-based,which becomes narrower within days of age. Themenace response (a learned response) develops atapproximately 7-10 days. Foals under 10 days ofage are visual but have not learned to blink inresponse to an approaching or menacing object.However, if a strong light is applied to the eye, thefoal is able to blink because this involves a subcor- tical reflex (dazzle reflex, Fig. 4) already present atbirth. Furthermore, cranial nerve reflexes are alsopresent in neonatal foals at the time of birth (e.g.,pupillary light reflex). Cranial nerve decits mightbe apparent during the initial observation beforeapproaching the patient. As mentioned earlier, au-ditory function is fully developed in the neonatal foal(Fig. 5). Palpation is essential to detect areas of apparent pain, local temperature, muscle tone and symmetry,joint extension and flexion, and tail tone amongother ndings. Tactile stimuli results in brisk ex- aggerated responses and reactions in normal foalscompared to older animals. Segmental (spinal) re-flexes that can order to assess segmental reflexesinvolving the thoracic and pelvic limbs, foals mustbe in lateral recumbency and relaxed. It is notpossible to properly evaluate these in the standingfoal. Also, if the foal is in lateral recumbency butthrashing or with increased muscle tone or rigidity,evaluation and interpretation of reflexes will becompromised, faulty, inaccurate, or simply not pos-sible to perform. The cross-extensor reflex may ormay not be present in the neonatal period. If pres-ent, it is not considered abnormal, and as the foalages, this reflex becomes inapparent. Extensorthrust reflex can also be seen in normal neonatalfoals. Neonatal foals have a hypermetric gait thatbecomes more coordinated by 3 days of age.

Cutaneous sensation can be evaluated toinvestigate the presence or absence of sensory func-tion. Nociception (conscious perception of pain) isonly evaluated if voluntary motor function is absentor difcult to interpret. It is important to considercongenital or hereditary disorders and other com-mon neonatal diseases that might affect the overallneurologic condition in foals. For examples seeTable 1. 3. Neuroanatomical Localization There are 3 major divisions of the nervous system:brain, spinal cord, and peripheral. These divisionsare further divided into various functional areas asfollows: 1. Brain A. CerebrothalamicB. BrainstemC. Cerebellum 2. Spinal cord (spinal cord segments): decit or pathologycaudal to T3 could be challenging to further localizeat times if segmental reflexes cannot be examineddue to patient cooperation, increased muscle tone, orin larger patients. However, alteration in cutane-ous trunci reflex and alterations in skin sensationcan be helpful. 3. Peripheral A. Nerve rootlets and rootsB. GangliaC. Nerves (motor and sensory) D. Neuromuscular junction a. Presynapticb. Synaptic c. Postsynaptic (muscle membrane) When localization to a specic or single area of thefunctional areas of the nervous system is not possi-ble, consider diffuse or multifocal localization.

Localizing the Lesion Based on Functional Anatomy Cerebrothalamus One or more signs might be observed, such as be- havior alterations (compulsive, bizarre, manic, andvocalization), lack of mare bonding and udder seek-ing, lack or delayed initiation of movement, centralblindness, wide meningoen-cephalomyelitis, trauma, and hereditary epilep-sies (Egyptian Arabian foals), among others. Brainstem Signs that might be observed when there is pathol-ogy in this location include an altered state of con-sciousness or mental status (obtunded, stuporous,and comatose), altered It is importantto note that cranial nerves have nuclei and tractswithin the brain (central components). All nervesare always peripheral. A description of cranialnerves is provided below. Vestibular nuclei are lo-cated in the brainstem; therefore, diseasesaffecting the caudal leaning to one side, ipsilateral cir-cling (small circles) to one side, and lack of with central vestibular disease. Cranial Nerves Responses, reactions, and reflexes can be evaluatedin the standing or recumbent foal. Cranial nervescan be evaluated in order from I to XII or by func-tional regions. The author prefers functional re-gions starting with the sense of smell (subjective);all eye functions (menace, palpebral ssure, palpe-bral reflex, corneal reflex, dazzle reflex, pupillarylight reflex, adaptation to light and darkness, eyeglobe and physiologic Vascular Hydrocephalus NAD ischemic encephalopathy Juvenile epilepsy /H114082020 199IN-DEPTH: NEONATOLOGYhension, suction, tongue tone and movement, and gag reflex). For clarication, dazzle reflex is a sub- cortical reflex that does not involve the brainstem.To check for dazzle and pupillary light reflexes, astrong light source must be used (Fig. 4).

Examples of diseases include cerebellarabiotrophy in Arabian horses and cerebellar hyp-oplasia. Dandy-w alker syndrome is a congenital malformation partial or complete ab-sence of the cerebellar vermis, resulting in the afore-mentioned signs. Cerebellar cysts have also beenseen by this author. Spinal Cord Decits, such as general proprioceptive ataxia, pa-resis, and upper motor neuron (UMN) or lowermotor neuron (LMN) signs, depending on locationwithin specic spinal cord segments, will be ob-served. Sensory decits include general proprio-ceptive ataxia (manifested as incoordination and body sway side to side) and proprioceptive decits.General proprioceptive ataxia is commonly knownas spinal noted, rule out othercauses of ataxia, such as cerebellar or vestibular.To determine the \"type\" of ataxia, look at the rest ofthe neurologic status of the foal. Does the foal havecerebellar tremors, and lackof menace response) or vestibular (pathologic nys-tagmus, head tilt, body lean, and circling in thedirection of the head tilt) signs? If the answer is yesto one of these, then you can answer the question. Motor decits include paresis (i.e., paraparesis, hemiparesis, hy-pometria (LMN), decreased muscle tone andweakness (more profound with LMN). Segmentalreflexes might be decreased or absent if LMN areinvolved. Sensory and/or motor decits will be ob-served depending on the location of injury withinthe spinal cord. For example, compressive myelop-athies present with a combination of sensory andmotor decits, whereas neuroaxonal dystrophy pri-marily affects sensory tracts within the spinal cordin addition to brainstem nuclei. Peripheral Nervous System This includes all areas of the nervous system thatare outside the brain and spinal cord. Note that allnerves are always peripheral (cranial nerves andspinal nerves). Therefore, it is redundant to sayperipheral nerves. Cranial nerve decits will bethose pertaining to specic (described above).Similarly, specic gait decits will be observed de-pending which nerves are affected in the thoracicand pelvic limbs. The brachial and lumbosacralplexuses are also part of the peripheral nervoussystem (outside the spinal cord). Neuromuscular System The neuromuscular system central (LMNs) roots, ganglia, nerves,and neuromuscular junction) components. 6Neuro- muscular disorders can be diffuse or focal. Signs ofdiffuse neuromuscular disease include generalizedweakness, difculty supporting /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: NEONATOLOGYparalysis, muscle and a become recumbent. Dysphagia, dysphonia, la-ryngeal collapse, and dyspnea could be clinical man-ifestations of neuromuscular disease. Segmental(spinal) reflexes can be decreased or absent in neu- romuscular disease. An example of a common dif-fuse neuromuscular disorder in foals is botulism.Electrolyte derangements ofnerves and cal-cium and magnesium are particularly important forproper neurotransmission. Note that alterations inpH affect the binding of calcium and magnesium toproteins, resulting in a decrease or increase of avail-able ionized calcium and magnesium. It is impor-tant to practice caution with the use of drugs andfluids that could further alter neuromuscular func-tion if neuromuscular disease is present. For in-stance, hypermagnesemia can cause similar signs tobotulism. Therefore, fluids containing magnesiummight not be the ideal type of therapy for foals withbotulism or other causes of neuromuscular weak-ness. Examples of drugs that might contribute tospecic signs pertaining to the region affected, suchas specic gait decits, decreased muscle tone, de-creased or absent tendon reflexes, and focal muscleatrophy. Neuromuscular Disease of Critical Illness Acquired neuromuscular dysfunction in the criticalcare setting is a recognized problem in human medi-cine, with an estimated prevalence of 46% in criticalpatients. Acquired disorders include critical illnessmyopathy, critical illness p olyneuropathy, or a com- bination of both. These disorders are associatedwith sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syn-drome, multi-organ dysfunction, and/or prolongedmechanical ventilation. The clinical hallmark ofthese is weakness. Weakness is a common clinicalsign in diseased neonatal foals, and recognition ofacquired neuromuscular disease might be challeng-ing. An increased risk of acquired neuromusculardisease has been associated with hyperglycemia andmechanical ventilation for over 7 days. Dysregula- tion of calcium and magnesium concentrations mightcontribute to neuromuscular weakness. Such dys-regulation has been reported in foals with septicemia,endotoxemia, and gastrointestinal disease. 6. What Is Next? Once it is determined that the foal has a neurologicproblem alone or concurrent with other illness, a diag-nostic work up can be performed. The diagnostic ap-proach should be tailored to the specic problem of thefoal and what is going to provide more information orguidance for diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis in alow-risk and cost-effective way. It is not necessary torun all the tests available, and risks and benets ofcertain diagnostic aids must be considered (e.g.,procedures that require anesthesia may be contrain-dicated in severely compromised foals due to neuro-muscular disease). A full description and indicationof diagnostic modalities are beyond the scope of thistext. A brief description is provided. Full blood work (complete blood count, chemistry panel, blood gases, and pH), and urinalysis should bepart of a minimum data base collection in critically illfoals. Although myopathies will not be discussedhere, for the purpose of clarication, muscle enzymeswithin reference values do not rule out a (e.g., hyperkalemic periodic paralysis diseaseand myotonia congenita). muscle may be elevated includeionophores, organophosphate toxicity, and those asso-ciated with tick infestation.

Introduction Genetic testing typically involves the analysis of an animal's DNA to determine the individual's geno-type for an inherited disorder or trait. Genetictesting may be used for permanent individual identi- cation and parentage determination. Breed regis-tries, including the Thoroughbred Jockey Club and,in certain instances, the American Quarter HorseAssociation, now require such verication to ensurethe accuracy of their pedigrees. Genetic testing isalso used to test for specic diseases or traits. Tointerpret genetic testing results for future breeding,an understanding of the mode of inheritance is re-quired. At this time, many of the genetic testsavailable for horses are for an autosomal-recessivedisorder to determine whether an animal is a car-rier. Carriers are usually phenotypically normalbut have the potential to produce diseased progeny.Dominant disorders also exist in the horse and ge-netic tests may be used to denitively diagnose af-fected horses. 2. Materials and Methods This presentation will focus on recently availablegenetic disease tests specic to foals and yearlings inthe United States, including the ve-panel genetictest in the American Quarter Horse (QH) and in QH and QH-relatedbreeds. 3. Results Five-Panel Genetic Test The American Quarter Horse Association has man- dated that all breeding stallions have a ve-panelgenetic test on le prior to registration of foals re-sulting from breedings after January 1, 2015. Thispanel includes genetic tests for hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (PSSM1), and malignant hyperthermia (MH).As of 2018, the American Paint Horse Association alsorequires breeding stallions to have the ve-panel ge-netic disease test results on le, plus lethal white foalsyndrome prior to the registration of their foals. HYPP HYPP is inherited as an autosomal-semi-dominanttrait and results in episodic weakness and paralysis.Episodes typically last between 15 and 60 minutesand horses may appear completely normal between 202 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: NEONATOLOGY NOTESepisodes. Muscle fasciculations and sweating in flanks, necks, and shoulders may be observed. During severe attacks, horses may dog-sit or become recumbent. Homozygous foals skeletal muscle sodiumchannel alpha-subunit (SCN4A). 2The mutation results in failure of a of sodium chan-nels to inactivate when serum potassium concentra-tions are increased. The excessive influx of sodiumand efflux of potassium results in persistent depo-larization of mu scle cells followed by temporary weakness. Treatment includes feeding grain orcorn syrup to stimulate insulin-mediated movementof potassium across cell membranes, acetazolamide(3 mg/kg every orally) or, in severecases, calcium glucon ate, dextrose, or sodium bi- carbonate administered intravenously. With se-vere dyspnea, a tracheostomy may be required.Long-term management includes regular exerciseand frequent turnout and feeding a balanced dietcontaining between 0.6% and 1.1% to 1.5% totalpotassium concentrations and meals containing/H1102133 g of potassium. 3 GBED GBED is inherited as an autosomal-recessive trait.Clinical signs include stillbirth, transient flexurallimb deformities, seizures, and respiratory or car-diac failure. 4,5GBED is caused by a nonsense mutation in the glycogen branching enzyme gene(GBE1). 6The mutation results in the inability to create a branched structure of glycogen. As a re-sult, cardiac and skeletal muscle, liver, and braincannot store or mobilize glycogen to maintain nor-mal glucose homeostasis. There is no hematomas, openwounds, or sloughing skin, are typically not evidentuntil about 1.5 years of age and are often associatedwith initial saddling or trauma. 7Skin is often loose and easily tented, primarily along the dorsum.HERDA is due to a missense mutation in the cyclo-philin B gene (PPIB). 8The mutation is hypothe- sized to affect protein folding of collagens. There iscurrently no targeted treatment for HERDA. Pre-vention involves maintaining horses indoors andaway from other horses to prevent development ofprogression of lesions. PSSM1 PSSM1 is inherited as an autosomal-dominant traitand affects QH-related breeds, in addition to draftbreeds, Rocky Horses, Tennessee WalkingHorses, Morgans, and Haflingers. Horses may beasymptomatic or demonstrate signs of exertionalrhabdomyolysis. 9Draft breeds may demonstrate muscle fasciculation and gait abnormalities. Thegenetic mutation is a missense mutation in the gly-cogen synthase 1 gene (GYS1). 10The mutation results in unregulated glycogen synthesis and po-tentially impaired aerobic glycogen metabolism.For treatment of acute episodes, stall connementmay be indicated for /H1102148 hours. Hydration status should be assessed and sedatives and anti-inflammatories administered to well-hydratedhorses to relieve anxiety and pain. For the preven-tion of future episodes, owners should follow a grad-ual return to exercise, using incremental trainingalong with dietary management aimed at providingadequate, but not excessive calories, by decreasing glucose load (dietary starch /H1102110% daily digestible energy) and providing fat as an alternate energysource (up to 13% of daily digestible energy). 11 MH MH is inherited as an autosomal-dominant trait andonly the heterozygous state has been described. Clinical signs, including hyperthermia, lactic acido-sis and muscle rigidity, are initiated by exposureto halogenated anesthetics or upon stress/excite-ment. 12Episodes may lead to death. The genetic etiology is a missense mutation in the ryanodinereceptor type 1 gene (RYR1). 13The mutation re- sults in excessive release of calcium into the myo-plasm and a hypermetabolic state. To prevent anepisode, pre-treatment with dantrolene (4 mg/kg)30-60 minutes prior to anesthesia is advised. 14 During an episode, hyperthermia and acidemiashould be treated with alcohol, chilled intravenousfluids with sodium bicarbonate, and mechanicalventilation. Arabian and Related Breeds Genetic tests are currently being offered for fourgenetic diseases in Arabians and Arabians and carriers have been identi- ed in Bashkir Curly Horses, Trakehners, andWelsh ponies, most likely due to Arabian ancestry.The mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive.Clinical signs are consistent with a cerebellarataxia, including dysmetria, spasticity, wide-basedstance, intention tremors and a lack of menace re-sponse, with an age of onset around 2.5 to 6 monthsof age. The genetic etiology was discovered in 2011as a missense mutation located in exon 4 of TOE1 (Target of EGR1) and approximately 1200 bp up-stream from MUTYH (MutY Homolog). 15TOE1 is expressed in the central nervous system, though not at high levels in the cerebellum, and is involved incell cycle regulation. As the missense mutationdoes not appear to cause a deleterious amino acidchange (arginine to histidine), its role 66 /H114082020 203IN-DEPTH: NEONATOLOGYopment of the CA phenotype is the subject of ongoing research. MUTYH is highly expressed in the cere- bellum and encodes for a DNA glycosylase involvedin post-replicative repair in the nuclei of rapidlyproliferating Purkinje cells as well as DNA repairdue to oxidative damage of m itochondrial genomes. There is no available treatment for CA. LFS LFS, also referred to as lethal LFS or coat color dilution lethal, affects Egyptian lineage Arabian ne-onates. Foals have a silver, pewter, lavender, orpale chestnut (pink) coat color and demonstrate te-tanic episodes with opisthotonus, paddling and ex-tensor rigidity from birth. 16Foals cannot become sternal or stand and suckling may be strong, weak,or absent. Direct and indirect pupillary light re-sponses are generally present, although ventralstrabismus and nystagmus may be observed. Re-flexes may be present but result in an exaggeratedresponse characterized by increased paddling and ri-gidity. 16It is unclear if paddling episodes are due to seizure activity or attempts for the foal to stand, aselectroencephalograms have not been performed.There are no specic clinicopathologic abnormalities,unless other conditions are present. Radiographs ofskull and cervical spine are normal. A denitive di-agnosis requires genetic testing. Treatment consistsmainly of supportive care. Diazepam and phenobar-bital may provide temporary relief; however, whetherthis is due to sedative or anticonvulsant effects of thesedrugs is unknown. The clinical condition deterio-rates despite treatment, necessitating euthanasia. LFS is inherited as an autosomal-recessive trait and was the rst equine disease to have the molec-ular genetic mutation mapped utilizing a single nu-cleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based study approach with the rst-generationequine a,16Six LFS-affected and 30 healthy relatives were genotyped and 14 highly sig-nicant SNPs were identied on chromosome 1spanning a region of 10.5 Mb. Homozygosity map-ping further narrowed the region to a 1.6-Mb blockthat was homozygous in all six affected horses andheterozygous in obligate carriers. Ten genes fellinto this region, including one of the two candidategenes for the disease, myosin Va ( MYO5A). Se- quencing of the 39 exons of MYO5A revealed a sin- gle base pair deletion in exon 30, causing the reading frame to shift and creating a premature stopcodon in the translation of exon 30. Based upon theknown function of the gene in other species and highconservation across the mutated region, it is hypoth-esized that the mutation impairs binding of myosinVa to organelles with appropriate receptors, whichleads to the loss of vesicle trafc (melanosomesand dendritic cargo) and interferes with the func- of melanocytes and neurons. 16A genetic test for LFS is available. This test can be used to de-nitively diagnose LFS and determine carrier sta-tus, especially of Egyptian lineage Arabian horses.A possible relationship between LFS and juvenile idiopathic epilepsy (JIE) has been postulated, asboth conditions occur in Arabian foals of Egyptianbreeding and overlap between mares producing bothLFS- and JIE-affected foals has been reported.In a study investigating known genetic mutations ofArabians, the MYO5A mutation was not found in 10 Egyptian Arabian foals with conrmed JIE via elec-troencephalogram. 17The clinical presentation of JIE and LFS is distinct. Foals with JIE demon-strate seizures during the rst year of life that spon-taneously resolve at 1 year of age. By contrast,seizures associated with LFS are present at birthand foals cannot survive past a few days of age, evenwith supportive care. Additionally, the dilute coatcolor phenotype observed with LFS is not seen withJIE. There is strong evidence that JIE is inher-ited 18and two candidate genes were excluded.19 A recent publication documented a putative geneticmutation for JIE, 20but this was disproven in a strin- gently phenotyped population.21Research into the genetic etiology of therefore ongoing. Occipitoatlantoaxial Malformation of Arabians Familial occipitalization of the atlas with atlanta- lization of the axis in Arabian horses leads to eitherstillborn foals or foals with neurologic abnormalitiesat birth. Clinical signs include symmetrical uppermotor neuron signs and general proprioceptive def-icits. An extended neck posture may be observed,with an audible \"click\" heard during neck movementdue to movement of the dens. A diagnosis can bemade using cervical radiography. For one variantof Occipitoatlantoaxial Malformation of Arabians(OAAM), a genetic test is available. 22 OAAM is suspected to be inherited as an autosomal- recessive trait in the Arabian breed. FamilialOAAM seen in Arabian horses is very similar to thatdescribed in Hoxd3 /H11002//H11002mice, which are homozygous for of the homeobox containinggene, Hoxd3. 23Mice homozygous for this mutation demonstrate occipitilization of the atlas and atlan-tization of the axis, an aspect of the phenotype thatis fully penetrant. The homeobox (HOX) gene clus-ter is involved in the development of the axial andappendicular skeleton. In 2017, whole-genome se-quencing was performed in an OAAM-affected horseand a 2.7-kb deletion was located 4.4 kb downstreamof the end of HOXD4 and 8.2 kb upstream of the start of HOXD3. 22Both parents of the OAAM- affected horse were heterozygous for the deletionwhile the affected foal was homozygous. The dele-tion was not found in 371 horses of other breeds.While the variant was found in the carrier state intwo other unaffected Arabians, two additional Ara-bian OAAM-affected foals did not have the 2.7-kbdeletion. An in-depth examination of the foals'phenotypes revealed notable variation, includingcardiac deformities, and it is postulated geneticheterogeneity the HOXD locus NEONATOLOGYSCID SCID is inherited as an autosomal-recessive trait in Arabian horses. At birth, foals appear normal butdevelop infections by 6 to 10 weeks postpartumwhen colostral antibodies decline. The genetic mu-tation is a 5-bp deletion resulting in a frameshiftmutation and 967-amino-acid deletion in DNA-protein kinase catalytic subunit ( DNA-PKcs). 24 The mutation results in the ability to recombineparticular gene segments in order to form codingsequences of immunoglobulin T-cell antigen re-ceptor variable regions recombination].SCID-affected B T lymphocytes.Due to infection, SCID-affected foals typically die by5 months of age. Friesians In the Friesian foal, there are currently two genetic tests available: hydrocephalus and dwarsm. Hydrocephalus Friesian hydrocephalus affects Friesian fetuses and foals, with no sex predilection. Affected Friesianfoals are aborted, stillborn, or born with severe neu-rologic debilitation and cranial distention, often as adystocia. The phenotype is clinically apparent, andradiographs can support a diagnosis. Denitive di-agnosis can be achieved through genetic testing.There are no treatment options available. Hydrocephalus, an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the central nervous system(CNS), is rarely encountered in the horse. It isassociated with known genetic mutations in mice,cattle, and humans. Friesian hydrocephalus is inher-ited as an autosomal-recessive trait. In 2015, agenome-wide association study of hydrocephalus in 13affected Friesians and 69 control Friesians found thata nonsense /H11022T) in exon 12 of the /H9252-1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 (B3GALNT2) gene on chromosome 1 was associated with Friesian hydrocephalus.25The mutation is identical to a B3GALNT2 mutation identied in a human case of muscular dystrophy-dystroglycano-pathy with hydrocephalus. B3GALNT2 is involved in glycosylation of dystroglycans, which are presentin skeletal muscle but also in many tissues like thebrain, where it impacts morphogenesis and earlydevelopment. Immunohistochemical examinationof muscle biopsies from Friesians with hydrocepha-lus would need to be performed to determinewhether muscular dystrophy is also present in thesehorses. From this study, the estimated allele fre-quency in Friesians was determined to be 8.5%. 25 Genetic testing for hydrocephalus in Friesians isavailable. Recently, the B3GALNT2 mutation was identied in an aborted Belgian draft horse fetus. 26 Further work is necessary to evaluate the inheri-tance of hydrocephalus across other breeds.Dwarsm Dwarsm is inherited as an autosomal-recessive trait in the Friesian. Clinical signs include dispro-portionate dwarsm characterized by a severelyshortened stature, shortened limbs relative to over-all body size, bowed forelegs, shortened neck and adisproportionally large cranium. The genetic mu-tation in Friesians is a splice site mutation in theB4GALT7 gene. 27 Other Breeds Hoof Wall Separation Disease of ConnemaraPonies Hoof wall separation disease is an autosomal-reces- sive trait affecting Connemara ponies. Clinical signs include separation and cracking of the outerhoof wall. This can lead to ponies having to sup-port their weight on the sole of the hoof instead ofthe hoof wall, which, in some cases, can result inchronic inflammation, severe lameness, and lamini-tis. A ffected ponies typically show clinical signs within the rst 6 months of life and all four feet aretypically affected. The genetic defect is a 1-bp in-sertion in SERPINB11, leading to a premature stop codon. 28 Warmblood Fragile Foal Syndrome (Type 1) Warmblood fragile foal syndrome type 1 is an autosomal-recessive trait affecting Hanoverians,Selle F rancais, KWPN, Oldenburg, horses. Clinical include hyperexten- sible, abnormally thin, fragile skin and mucousmembranes that are subject to open lesions. 29Af- fected horses may also have hyperextensible limbjoints, floppy ears, of fluid (hydrops),subcutaneous emphysema, hematomas, and prema-ture birth. 30The disease is present at birth and affected newborn foals are euthanized shortly afterbirth due to the poor prognosis of this untreatablecondition. The genetic defect is a missense muta-tion in the equine lysyl hydroxylase gene ( LH1), the orthologous gene responsible human cases ofEhlers-Danlos syndrome VI. 30 Junctional Epidermolysis Bullosa Genetic testing for junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) became mandatory for Belgian stallions as ofNovember 1, 2002 and for breeding-age mares in2015. This autosomal-recessive disease, caused bya cytosine (C) insertion in exon 10 of the LAMC2 gene, is characterized by extensive and debilitatingblistering of the skin and mouth epithelium as wellas hoof sloughing. Affected foals eventually suc-cumb or are euthanized before 10 days ofage. 31The same mutation has also been found to be associated with the JEB phenotype in other drafthorse breeds. 32 Genetic testing is available for a second form of JEB (termed JEB2) identied in the American Sad-dlebred. This disorder is associated a /H110116.5-kb AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 205IN-DEPTH: NEONATOLOGYdeletion spanning exons to 27 of the LAMA3 gene that was identied exclusively in leading to eitherwidespread muscle atrophy following an infectionor vaccination, or a nonexertional rhabdomyolysis.In 2018, a missense mutation in myosin heavy chain1(MYH1) was associated with IMM in the QH. 34 This mutation is also associated with nonexertionalrhabdomyolysis in this breed. 35Allele frequencies were estimated to be 0.034 in the general QH pop-ulation and highest among reining, working cow,and halter horses and was not detected in the barrelracing and racing QH's subpopulations studied. 36 4. Discussion It is important to realize that no association or com-mittee evaluates quality control of DNA tests thatare available in animals. Most tests are publishedin the scientic literature not as tests, but as articlesdescribing the discovery of the mutation. In 2018,the horse genomics research community developed aconsensus statement on the application of researchfor commercial use, which may assist animal ownersand clinicians in choosing a laboratory for testingand help in deciding which tests may be most ads/1cq72554i_ should bereproducible and subject to the peer-review processand clear differentiation should be made betweenscientic developments, commercial opportunity, andopinion.

Toribio, DVM, MS, PhD, DACVIM Critical illness in newborn foals activates multiple endocrine systems, with the ultimate goal of maintaining organ function to assure survival in the immediate post-natal period. Depending on thedisease process and foal maturity, endocrine dysregulation may develop, which can further impairbehavior, immunity, energy homeostasis, fluid and electrolyte balance, oxygen and nutrient delivery,tissue differentiation, cell function, and the likelihood of survival. Therefore, a better understandingof these endocrinopathies can improve preventative and therapeutic approaches to disorders of theequine neonate. Some of this information is already improving therapeutics in hospitalizedfoals. To move this eld forward and enhance understanding on endocrine regulation and dysregu- lation in the equine neonate, additional research will be needed to better elucidate the role offactors for which some information is available, but in particular for systems for which knowledgeis minimal and could have clinical implications.

Introduction immu- (NMS)/neonatal encephalopathy, and at a disadvantage, often resulting insepsis and death. 1-8Sepsis remains the main cause of mortality in newborn foals, with a prognosisfor survival ranging from 35% to 60%. 1-7Critically ill foals present to intensive care units with evidence (cerebral, renal, intestinal, hepatic, pulmonary, immune).1-7The survival rate under these conditions is dictated bythe ability of various homeostatic systems to coordi-nate and overcome derangements. Unfortu- nately, some foals remain refractory to aggressivetherapies and succumb to sepsis, in part due toendocrine failure. In foals, the maturation of a number of endocrine systems occurs in late gestation and continues in theearly post-natal period. 9-14These adaptations are accompanied by changes in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA), energy metabolism, and cardiovascular system. 11-17Research on hor- monal dysregulation of critically ill foals has beenminimal, but advances are being made in under-standing various endocrine systems in healthy andsick newborn foals. It is reasonable to assume thatas knowledge of equine neonatal endocrine patho-physiology improves, better therapeutic strategiesto reduce mortality will be developed. 208 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: NEONATOLOGY NOTESThis document provides an overview of endocrine imbalances of newborn foals, with emphasis on sep- sis, dysmaturity, and NMS. Information aboutmany endocrine systems is lacking, but some prog-ress with clinical value has been made in recentyears. 2. Adrenal Insufciency The HPAA represents a complex regulatory modulates multiple physiological functions(metabolism, pain, hunger, thirst, blood pressure,autonomic activity, immunity, inflammation) aswell as the stress response. Under stress or phys-iological needs, the hypothalamus secretes cortico-tropin-releasing hormone and arginine-vasopressin(AVP), (parsdistalis; adenohypophysis) to release hormone (ACTH), on theadrenal cortex release cortisol. Cortisol regu-lates energy metabolism, modulates immune andinflammatory processes, and contributes to tissuedifferentiation and function. A disruption of the HPAA (adrenal insufciency), which results in inappropriately low cortisol concen-trations could have negative consequences. In fact,recent studies have shown that some critically illfoals develop adrenal insufciency, which is linkedto disease severity and mortality. 7,12,18-21Despite disease severity, these foals do not have the ex-pected cortisol secretion poor (relative adrenal insuf-ciency [RAI]). 12,19,24A more recently adopted term for RAI is critical illness-related corticosteroid insuf-ciency, which, in addition to endocrine abnormali-ties, also takes into consideration clinical ndings,an tis-sue refractoriness to corticosteroids. /H1100555-1175 12,18,22which could contribute and electrolyte abnormalities. Clinical Relevance Abnormally low corticoid concentrations in sick foalscould exacerbate the systemic inflammatory re-sponse, reduce tissue perfusion, disrupt energy ho-meostasis, and alter a number of tissue functions.This opens the question on the justication of re-placement therapy. Glucocorticoid therapy can beconsidered in critically ill foals with endocrine orclinical evidence of RAI, including tissue hypoperfu-sion, poor response to vasopressors, persistent hypo-glycemia, and protracted hyponatremia. In dys-maturity, glucocorticoid be benecial topromote tissue differentiation and function. Hy-drocortisone (cortisol) is the preferred glucocorticoidbecause it is an endogenous steroid with a shorthalf-life in foals (0.43 hours), 27but dexamethasone or prednisolone are valid alternatives, althoughtheir stronger immune-suppressive effects should betaken into consideration depending on the underly-ing disease process (septicemia, bacteremia, prema-turity). A tapering course of hydrocortisone (1.3mg/kg/day divided q4h IV) may have benecial anti-inflammatory effects without major immune sup-pression in sick foals. 21Glucocorticoid therapies have not been prospectively evaluated in foals withRAI to further support their potential benets.Therefore, recommendations are based on the cur-rent understanding of perinatal newborn foals (range /H110050.2 to 30 ng/mL) are similar or higher than values measuredin mares in their luteal phase and throughout preg-nancy. 12,28,29The adrenal gland and gonads are the main source of progestogen precursors (preg-nenolone) in the equine fetus, which are furthermetabolized to other steroids by the placenta. Thefetal adrenal gland gonads usedby the placenta to produce androgens and estrogens.However, information in sex steroids in healthy andsick foals remains scarce. 29Days before foaling there is an adrenal shift from progestogen to gluco-corticoid synthesis, reflected as a drop in progesto-gens with a parallel increase in fetal ACTH andcortisol concentrations, indicating maturation of theHPAA. 8This maturation foal progestogen con-centrations elevated, delaying the neonate post-partum arousing response, with implications to fetalto neonatal transition and adaptation to extrauter-ine life. 8,19,30,31Progestogens have sedative effects because they activate gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) type A (GABA A) receptors, similar to diaz- epam and barbiturates, which could explain the le-thargic behavior or disorientation developed bysome sick newborn foals. 31Moreover, increased progesterone concentrations during hospitalizationis a consistent nding in septic foals, which is linkedto severity of illness and mortality. 12,19,29,30,32In other words, progesterone concentrations in hospi-talized foals could have prognostic value. Allopregnanolone, which is Areceptor agonist, has sed- effects in foals.31Recent studies have shown that septic foals and foals with evidence of NMSoften have abnormally elevated concen-trations. 8,12,19,30One can speculate that by activat- ing GABAAreceptors, this could contribute to lethargy, disorientation, and abnormal behavior inthese foals.

If progestogens contribute to disorders in the equine neonate, this opens the question as towhether exogenous progestogens such as altreno-gest could alter the endocrine balance in foals.A recent study showed that septic foals born to al-trenogest-treated mares have lower ACTH andhigher progesterone concentrations than those bornto untreated mares 29; however, no association with survival was found. Clinical Relevance Increased concentrations of progestogen (progester-one in particular) is a frequent nding in critically illfoals; however, it remains unknown whether theycontribute to disease progression or reflect severityof disease and organ dysfunction. Elevated proges-togens may play a role in the pathogenesis of NMSand could have prognostic value. 4. Energy Homeostasis The energy regulatory systems are complex and com-prise multiple (pancreatic, involved in energy homeostasis, thyroid gland (follicular cells), liver (hepato-cytes), and bone (osteoblasts). Disorders of energyregulation are common in critically ill foals. De-spite the clinical signicance of energy dysregula-tion in sick foals, just recently some hormonesinvolved with energy metabolism were investigatedin hospitalized foals. 9,33-36 Hypoglycemia is more frequent than hyperglyce- mia, and both are linked to mortality.9,37Septic foals often have low insulin,9,33but increased gluca- gon and triglyceride concentrations,9which likely reflects their metabolic balance and energy needs.The main function of glucagon is to increase bloodglucose concentrations by promoting gluconeogene-sis and glycogenolysis, which in sick foals could beseen as an appropriate response. The low insulinconcentrations in septic foals is likely a response tohypoglycemia; however, in foals with hyperglyce-mia, low insulin values should be considered inade-quate. These are the foals that could not regulateglycemia and may require insulin therapy. This isalso an indication of disease severity that often re-sults in death. The enteroinsular axis (EIA) is comprised of intes- tinal factors that stimulate the pancreas to secreteinsulin. glucose-dependent insulino-tropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide 1 se-creted by K and L cells, respectively. These factorsare also known as incretins and represent the basis forthe new generation of drugs used to treated diabetes inpeople. The EIA seems to be more important thanglucose in promoting insulin secretion. 38Horses have a functional EIA and it has been proposed thatincreased EIA activity may contribute to the patho-genesis of equine metabolic syndrome. 39It has been shown that the dynamics of the EIA in healthy new-born foals is different from horses, likely due to theirdiet (type and composition) and perhaps influenced byother endocrine factors in the immediate post-partumperiod. 36Information on the EIA in healthy and sick foals is lacking. A recent study found that some sep-tic foals have high glucagon-like peptide 1, but lowinsulin their normo- to hyper-glycemia. 40This indicates a \"disconnect\" between the intestine (incretins) and insulin secretion, whichcould explain glucose intolerance in some severely illfoals (e.g., hyperglycemia in premature or septic foals). The somatotropic axis consists of growth hormone (GH) from the pituitary gland, insulin-like growthfactor 1 (IGF-1), mainly produced by the liver, andghrelin from the stomach. The peripheral actionsof GH are mediated IGF-1, therefore, an increase inGH should be followed by elevations in IGF-1 levels.Ghrelin is produced by gastric glandular cells inresponse to anorexia to promote hunger, but is alsoa potent GH secretagogue. Critically ill foals oftenhave increased concentrations of GH, 35but reduced levels of IGF-1, suggesting abnormal somatotropicaxis signaling. This phenomenon has been termed\"somatotropic axis resistance,\" 35which appears to be similar to insulin resistance in horses, but itsclinical implications remain to be elucidated. Thisis supported by the fact the same foals with high GHalso have increased ghrelin concentrations, indicat-ing that the pituitary component of the axis is func-tional. Therefore, the evidence points at impairedsignaling at the hepatocyte level. This is likely aconsequence of systemic inflammation or endotox-emia, which are frequent ndings in septic adipocyte-derived hormone (adipo- leptin suppresses hun-ger) and its blood concentrations correlate withtotal body fat in horses, humans, dogs, and otherspecies. 41Leptin increases insulin sensitivity in different species. In newborn foals, leptin con-centrations rise after birth to decline few dayslater. 42No differences in blood leptin concentra - tions were found between healthy and sick foals.9 However, leptin concentrations were lower in sep-tic foals that died. 9Information on this factor in foals remains minimal to determine its role inenergy metabolism during health and disease. Adiponectin is another adipocyte-derived peptide hormone, which is negatively correlated with bodyfat mass in horses and other species, but also in-creases insulin sensitivity. 41,43Adiponectin pro- motes the cell membrane different between healthy, sick non-septic,and septic foals. 44Therefore, its role in the patho- /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: NEONATOLOGYgenesis of and flammation in the equine neonate remains to beelucidated. Clinical Relevance Critically ill foals often develop hypoglycemia due toenergy deprivation, minimal energy reserves, bacte-remia, or endocrine dysregulation. In foals withhypoglycemia or under a negative energy balance,low insulin, high glucagon, and high triglycerideconcentrations indicate a proper homeostatic re-sponse to restore energy balance 9; however, a failure of these mechanisms could be detrimental. In sickfoals with persistent hyperglycemia (when bloodglucose concentrations remain elevated for hourswithout minimal to no energy supplementation),reduced insulin secretion rather than insulin resis-tance should be suspected. 9,33Insulin resistance does occur in critically ill foals, but recent studieshave shown that most septic foals have low insulinconcentrations. 9,33In these cases, insulin replace- ment therapy to restore glycemia should be consid-ered. Care should be taken with insulinadministration to newborn foals because most areinsulin sensitive and hypoglycemia may develop.It is to use continuous-rate infusions (CRI)over intravenous or subcutaneous administration,with some exceptions hyperglycemia).The recommended starting CRI for regular insulinis 0.0025 to 0.01 IU/kg/hour with steady increasesevery 2 to 4 hour to 0.2 IU/kg/h, even higher untilnormoglycemia is restored. 45-49Glucose concen- trations must be monitored closely to avoid hypogly-cemia. It is important to mention that the conceptof hyperglycemia and its implications differ betweensick and healthy foals. concentrations of200 to 250 mg/dL (11.1-13.9 mmol/L) in healthyfoals can be normal, in particular after nursing, butin septic foals, these values are abnormal, in partic-ular when enteral feeding, parenteral dex-trose or parenteral inthese animals endocrine dys-regulation, organ dysfunction, or iatrogenic. Incretin analogs to enhance insulin secretion have not been evaluated in horses or foals; however, theyhave become central to diabetes management inpeople and cats. The functionality of the EIA inhealthy foals suggests that incretins could be a ther-apeutic alternative to insulin in sick foals with per-sistent hyperglycemia. 5. Thyroid Hormones Thyroid hormones (THs) modulate cell growth, dif-ferentiation, thermogenesis, and energy metabo-lism. THs also influence the differentiation ofother endocrine systems (adrenal gland, pancreas).Therefore, THs are essential for fetal developmentand subsequent survival. The secretion of THs isunder the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. THs are produced by the follicularcells of the thyroid gland. THs include total T4,free T4, T3, free T3, and reverse T3. Of T3 is the active hormone. The secretion of THsis influenced by a number of factors, including age,physiological status, season, caloric intake, exoge-nous compounds, and diseases. Due to their pleio-tropic functions, it is reasonable to assume that lowTH concentrations in the developing fetus and new-born foal could have negative consequences. Thisis evident respiratory failure, inappropriate ner-vous tissue development, as well as other abnormal-ities. Recent studies have shown that premature,septic, and maladjusted foals often have low THconcentrations that are linked to disease severityand mortality. 35,50,51Low thyroid hormone concen- trations during critical illness does not equate tohypothyroidism. This condition is known as \"eu-thyroid sick syndrome,\" but in human medicine theterm, \"non-thyroidal illness syndrome,\" is preferred.The clinical relevance of NTIS remains unclear. Clinical Relevance Low TH concentrations in sick newborn foals areassociated with disease severity and mortality,which supports their importance in tissue develop-ment and differentiation. The value of TH replace-ment therapy has not been evaluated in hospitalizedfoals, but should be considered in foals with evi-dence of dysmaturity and severe sepsis. Thissubject remains controversial in human intensivecare medicine. 6. Calcium and Magnesium Total calcium (TCa) in circulation exists bound toproteins (albumin), in a free/ionized (lactate, bicarbonate, citrate).Calcium has hor-mone renal reabsorptionof Ca 2/H11001, synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D3, as well as bone Calcitriol inhibits parathyroid cellfunction and PTH secretion. Blood and Ca lower in foals (TCa /H1100510 to 13 mg/dL; Ca2/H11001/H110054.1 to 7 mg/dL) than horses (TCa /H11005 11 to 13.2 mg/dL; Ca2/H11001/H110055.8 to 7 mg/dL),52-56which is important to know when assessing normal fromabnormal or using horse-specic reference ranges.While TCa is reported in most biochemistry seldom measured in foals. Foals with hy- can have low TCa concentrations, have clinical hypocalcemia because Ca 2/H11001concen- trations are normal.55,57The same principles ap- ply to magnesium (below). Hypocalcemia is frequent in critically ill equine patients (foals and horses).7,56,58In foals with sep- sis, hypocalcemia could lead to a of abnor-malities in other hy- have an appropriate PTH response.However, there are few foals with low PTH (inap-propriate secretion). 53,54,58There are also foals with an exaggerated PTH secretion, which could bereflecting low vitamin D levels (see vitamin D sec-tion below). 54,58 Other conditions associated with calcium dys- regulation newborn foals include hypocalcemia hypocalcemic of hy-pocalcemia in the immediate post-partum period,are refractory to medical treatment, can be hypo-magnesemic, and usually die. 55A putative gene mutation for this condition was recently identiedin Thoroughbred foals and this disorder was re-named equine hypocalcemia. 59 Hypercalcemia of unknown reasons hy-pocalcemia) has been reported in a subset of sickfoals. Some of these foals have a history pla-cental disease, dystocia, or perinatal asphyxia. Total magnesium (TMg), similar to TCa, exists bound to proteins, free/ionized (Mg 2/H11001), and chelated to anions.60Functions of acid neuromuscular excitability, and calcium ho-meostasis. Measurement of blood TMg and Mg 2/H11001 concentrations is becoming more common, in partresult of the increasing awareness of magnesiumdisorders in horses and foals. Blood concentrationsof TMg and Mg 2/H11001tend to /H110050.54 to Mg2/H11001/H110050.46 mmol/L; Mg2/H11001/H110050.46 to 0.8 mmol/L).52,53,56,60,61 Hypomagnesemia is frequent in septic foals, but rarely diagnosed because it is not reported in mostchemistry proles or considered a problem by clini-cians. 53,60Low magnesium could interfere with calcium homeostasis and energy regulation.57,60 Clinical Relevance Parenteral calcium supplementation is rarely donein critically ill foals, but should be considered insevere hypocalcemia A standard treatment protocolis to add 10 to 20 mL of 23% calcium gluconate perliter of parenteral fluids and administer CRIor intermittent boluses. 55Measurement of Ca2/H11001 and Mg2/H11001concentrations adjust dosing. Intravenous administration magnesiumsulfate (MgSO 4) is indicated for hypocalcemia, pro-longed fluid nutrition and hypergly-cemia (hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypomag-nesemia). It is also used to treat neurologicaldisorders such as NMS and brain trauma. 8,60A CRI of MgSO4(40 to 60 mg/kg/IV, loading dose; 50 to 150 mg/kg/day/IV, CRI) is the best way to supple-ment magnesium to hospitalized foals. 8,60One practical approach is to add 2 grams of MgSO4perliter of isotonic solution and administer intermit- tently (500 to 1000 ml/IV, every 4 to 6 hours). 7. Vitamin D Vitamin D derives from dietary sources (vitamin D2or ergocalciferol from fungi and plants; vitamin D3or of 3(cholecalciferol) after photolytic cleavage of 7-dehydrocholesterol. Subse-quently, cholecalciferol is converted in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3[25(OH)D3] by 25-hydroxylase, which is transported to the kidneys to be converted by1 /H9251-hydroxylase to the active metabolite, 1,25(OH)2D3 (calcitriol). Vitamin D2(ergocalciferol) is a major source of vitamin D for horses55,62; however, its rele- vance in foals, based on their type of diet, remains unclear. Once in circulation, ergocalciferol followsthe same processing steps as cholecalciferol in the liverand kidney. Hepatic activation of vitamin D is poorlyregulated and blood levels of 25(OH)D reflect totalbody stores. 55In contrast, renal activation of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D is highly regulated by PTH, calcium, phosphorus, broblast growth and 1,25(OH) 2D.55Therefore, 1,25(OH)2D concentrations reflect daily homeostatic adjustmentsmore than the vitamin D status. Vitamin D promotes intestinal absorption and renal reabsorption of calcium and phosphorus,modulates bone remodeling, and suppresses PTHsynthesis. Other functions of vitamin includeimmune and /H9252-defensins; both properties, epithelial/endothelial integrity, and energy metabolism. Vi-tamin D concentrations are lower in healthy foals(25[OH]D /H110059.3 to 22 ng/mL) foals and associated with mortality.54,58 Dysregulation of FGF-23/klotho axis seems tocontribute have tions potent inhibitor of 1 /H9251- hydroxylase, the enzyme responsible for vitamin Dactivation in the kidney. Due to its pleiotropic actions, vitamin D deciency could contribute to hypocalcemia, bone abnormali-ties, epithelial disruption, loss of endothelial integ-rity, bacterial infections due to reduced antibacterialpeptides, impaired immune response, energy dys-regulation, and a pro-inflammatory state (relevantto sick foals). This opens the question as towhether vitamin D replacement therapy should beinvestigated in hospitalized foals. In human med-icine, there are a number of clinical trials evaluatingthe benets of vitamin D therapy in critically illadults and children. 64,65 212 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: NEONATOLOGYClinical Relevance Based on recent studies in foals54,58as well as con- trolled human trials,64,65there is a valid justica- tion to evaluate the potential benets of vitamin D therapy in sick newborn foals. 8. Other Endocrine Systems Recent studies in newborn foals have docu-mented dysregulation other endocrine sys-tems; remain to be elucidated. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is activated in most critically ill hypotensive foals,22 which is an adequate response to improve intravas-cular volume and tissue perfusion. Foals with verycold extremities and a poor RAAS response are lesslikely to survive. 22,68The RAAS and HPAA are highly interactive systems and factors from onecan activate the other. As mentioned in the HPAAsection, a subset of septic foals with RAI have lowcortisol and aldosterone secretion, 7,12,18,19,22,23 which directly and perfu-sion and organ function. Vasopressin (AVP; anti-diuretic hormone) is a potent vasopressor and itsconcentrations are increased in most critically illfoals 7; however, low concentrations could contribute hypovolemia, foal mortal-ity. 18In fact, AVP and analogs are used to increase blood pressure and tissue perfusion in septicfoals. 7,49It has been shown that adrenomedullin, a potent vasodilator, can be increased in critically illfoals. 66This, combined with reduced vasopressors (angiotensin-II, vasopressin), can further impairthe effective circulating blood volume and organfunction. Catecholamines have a multitude of functions; they are essential in the transition from intra-uterine to extra-uterine life, energy regulation, car-diovascular activity, and tissue perfusion. Somedata on adrenaline and noradrenaline is available inhealthy foals, 14but not much in sick ones. For example, the sympathoadrenal response to stress(e.g., insulin-induced hypoglycemia) in equine fe-tuses at the end of gestation is noradrenergic, whilein the post-partum period it is mainly adrenergic. 14 Considering that noradrenaline is more effective be-fore birth, it has been proposed to be the vasopressorof choice for premature and critically ill foals. 14 One study found minimal differences in atrial na- triuretic peptide (ANP) in hospitalized foals com-pared with horses. 67The main function of ANP is to increase renal excretion of sodium; however, theclinical relevance of this peptide in sick foals re-mains to be determined. The FGF-23/klotho axis is a recently described system with central functions in calcium, phospho-rus, vitamin D, and PTH regulation. 69FGF-23 is considered the main phosphorus-regulating hor-mone and is secreted by osteocytes 2D, PTH, and phosphorus promotes phosphorusexcretion by its renal reabsorption andsuppressing 1 /H9251-hydroxylase activity, therefore, 1,25(OH)2D synthesis. It also inhibits PTH synthe- sis and secretion. Klotho is a transmembrane pro-tein that is also found in circulation and functions asthe co-receptor for FGF-23. 69,70It was recently shown that critically ill foals have increased FGF-23and reduced klotho concentrations that are linked tohypovitaminosis D, disease severity, and mortal-ity. 58In human medicine, there has been extensive research on the FGF-23/klotho axis, showing that ithas major clinical and prognostic implications, inparticular in renal and cardiovascular disease. 69,70 9. Take-Home Message The central goal of the endocrine systems inthe developing equine fetus and neonate is topromote tissue differentiation and maintainhomeostasis to assure survival in the transi-tion from a protected intrauterine environ-ment to the challenges of extrauterine life. Endocrine dysregulation is frequent in criti-cally ill foals, often associated with diseaseseverity and outcome. While information forsome endocrine factors is available, data formost is lacking, and their interplay could becentral to disease progression and survival. Endocrinopathies during critical illness con-tribute to imbalances of behavior, energy,fluid and electrolytes, oxygen and nutrientdelivery, immunity, inflammation, cardio-vascular function, neuromuscular activity,and tissue differentiation, ultimately reduc-ing the odds of survival if homeostatic sys-tems fail or therapies are not implementedtimely and appropriately. Additional research on endocrinopathies im-pacting the newborn foal (e.g., sepsis, dysma-turity, maladjustment syndrome) couldhave preventative, therapeutic, and nancialimplications.

Failure of this organ systemmay manifest as diarrhea, ileus, abdominal pain,obstipation, and weight loss. Clinical syndromesassociated with colic, clinical manifestation, diag-nosis, and treatments for equine neonatal diarrhea. Infectious causes in na\u00efve. 1Rotavirus is a genus within the family Reoviridae. By electronmicroscopy, the viruses are noted to be about 70 to80 nm in size and look like wheels ( rota is derived from the latin word \"wheel\") with short spokes radi-ating from a wide central hub. Rotaviruses are alldouble stranded, ribonucleic acid (RNA), non-envel-oped viruses. Rotavirus is subdivided into several groups (A through G) based on differences in thegroup specic inner capsid protein, VP6. There arethree rotavirus groups (A, B, and C) that causedisease in humans compared to only 1 group thataffects the equine species (Group A). 2Equine rota- virus can be further subdivided using neutralizingantibodies to the VP4 and VP7 outer Balasuriya processed 108 diarrhea samples fromfoals /H110216 months of age located at 38 farms in Central Kentucky, and 23/108 (21%) of the diarrhealsamples were positive for Equine Rotavirus Type A. 4 Further detected that werethe G14 Strain, 6/23 one foal was coinfected with both. Previous studiesconducted in Kentucky noted that 100% of theEquine Rotavirus Type A were the G3 Strain. Thisis particular disturbing because various genetic andantigenic variants of G3 and G14 are circulating inthe horse population in Central Kentucky, and theysignicantly differ from the vaccine strain currentlyused in the eld. 216 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: NEONATOLOGY NOTESClinical Signs Clinical signs of disease have been reported only among foals /H110216 months old and most often among foals/H110213 months old.5Signs include diarrhea, leth- argy, anorexia, and abdominal tympani. A 3-yearstudy of horse farms in central Kentucky during the1980s noted that rotavirus was the most commoncause of diarrhea in foals. 5Rotavirus is species specic with an incubation period of 1 to 2 days.The virus invades the intestinal epithelium on thesides and the tips of the villi. The brush borderepithelium of the small intestine synthesizes disac-charides to monosaccharides (glucose and galac-tose), which are absorbed in the gut. Destruction ofthe brush border villi results in decreased lactaseformation, which results in lactose not being di-gested. This sugar remains in the lumen of the gut,osmotically attracting more fluid. This effect iscompounded as bacteria in the large intestine fer-ment the lactose into acetate, propionate and bu-tyrate, which increase osmolality of the coloniccontents. 6 Foals infected with rotavirus may shed the virus for up to 10 days.7,8Some horses may shed the virus for up to 8 months. The virus can persist inthe environment for up to 9 months. 8 Diagnosis Diagnosis requires detection of the virus in feces.The tests include electron microscopy, enzyme-linked and latex agglutination virogen ro-tatest. aIn a recent study by the author it was noted that when comparing the human specic ro-tavirus antigen ofusing some human diagnostic tests in veterinarymedicine (false negatives). Analysis of 35 sampleswith the human specic rotavirus immunoassayresulted in no positive results. Within that groupof samples, 13 tested positive by real-time PCR.Real-time was thatthe human specicity may notdetect some of the equine isolates. Treatments Treatments are generally empirical and symptom-atic including precautionary antibiotics and anti-ulcer medications (Carafate, 1 gram per 50-kg bodyweight PO omeprazole, lactase U/50 kg q3-8h for 10 to 14 days have been usedto improve digestion of milk lactose. Antidiarrhealmedications such as bismuth subsalicylate (1 to 3mL/kg PO q24h to q6h) may help reduce bowel in-flammation and provide for secondary toxin absorp-tion and resorption when combined with activatedcharcoal (1 gram/kg q24h). Neostigmine (1 mg SQq1-8h, IV tympany) often used to helprelieve gastrointestinal tympany. Fluid therapy isnecessary to correct hydration, shock, and electro-lyte imbalances. Prevention of this disease in-cludes proper hygiene and the use of phenoldisinfectants because bleach is ineffective againstthis virus. A commercial modied live vaccine cis currently available for use in mares prior to foalingto help accentuate colostral antibodies. 5It has been noted that foals from vaccinated mares can stillbecome infected with rotavirus although the clinicalsigns may be attenuated. One novel treatmentplan that may be used as an adjunctive treatmentfor viral causes of diarrhea is the use of Bentoniteclay. d9 3. Coronavirus Equine coronavirus was isolated and characterizedonly recently in 2000 but described as an infectiousagent in sick foals in 1976. 10,11Several studies and case reports have identied coronaviruses in foalswith enteric disease but the pathogenicity and itsetiologic role in enteric disease have not been exam-ined. A recent prevalence study in Central Ken-tucky by the author clearly shows that healthy foalswithout signs of GI disease are equally infected withequine coronavirus as sick animals. This ndingsuggests low pathogenicity of signicantly associated with diseased animals:all ECoV infections in the GI diseased group wereassociated with coinfections (15 of 15) while foals inthe healthy group were mostly monoinfected (8 of10). 12This nding would support the theory that (certain) viruses primarily act as immune suppress-ing agents allowing opportunistic infections to takeplace. 13Opportunistic infections can be of different origin, including bacterial or protozoal, as shown inthis study. Coinfection data in piglets clearly indi-cate that coronavirus and bacterial coinfectionshave a signicant effect on the magnitude of theinflammatory immune response and the amount oftissue damage compared to single infected ani-mals. 14Furthermore, in young turkeys, coronavi- rus, and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) were shown to synergistically interact and causesevere growth depression and high mortality whencompared to monoinfected turkeys. 15In this study, turkeys infected rst with coronavirus and thenwith EPEC developed numerically greater mortal-ity, signicantly lower survival probability, and in-creased frequency of attaching and effacing lesionsthan that observed in turkeys inoculated with EPECprior to turkey coronavirus or simultaneously inoc-ulated with these agents; these observations notonly suggest a role for coronavirus in foals, they alsosuggest diagnostic value of detecting ECoV in appar-ently healthy foals to assess their susceptibility forpotentially detrimental coinfections. In coronavi-rus-infected healthy foals, the focus PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 217IN-DEPTH: NEONATOLOGYrected toward epidemiological aspects in order to reduce the likelihood of coinfections. Clearly, ad-ditional studies are needed to determine equinecoronavirus virulence factors and the relative im-portance as a coinfecting agent to contribute to GIdisease in foals. Diagnosis Diagnosis can be made using polymerase chain re-action, virus isolation, or electron microscopy. Treatment Refer to the Rotavirus section for treatment. Cur-rently there is an ultra-puried Bentonite clay thatis available for the use in horses that has the samecomposition as a product being investigated for hu-man rotavirus or coronavirus. d,11 4. C. the agent that causes pseudomembra- nous colitis associated with antibiotics in humans.It is now being identied in recent years as a signif-icant nosocomial pathogen for equine as well as hu-man patients. First described in 1935 by Hall andO'Toole, this anaerobic bacillus wasnamed \"the difcult clostridium\" resistedearly attempt at isolation and grew very slowly.The organisms were found in stool specimens fromhealthy human neonates (up to 50%), which led toits classication as a commensal and was subse-quently ignored as a potential pathogen. In the1960s and 1970s, antibiotic-associated pseudomem-branous colitis became a major clinical problem,which was attributed to mucosal ischemia or viralinfection. In 1977, Larson et al 16reported that stool specimens from affected patients contained atoxin that produced cytopathic changes in tissueculture cells. C. difcile was identied as the source of the cytotoxin. It is now clear that C. dif- cile is responsible for virtually all cases of human pseudomembranous colitis and 20% of the cases ofantibiotic-induced colitis. Pathogenesis Pathogenesis of antibiotic-associated diarrhea/colitis begins with a disruption of colonization resis-tance (disruption of the normal colonic flora) ofC. difcile. Colonization occurs by the oral-fecalroute. C. difcile forms heat-resistant spores that can persist in the environment for years. Thesespores can survive the acid environment of the stom-ach and convert to vegetative forms in the colon.Environment contamination by C. difcile is partic- ularly common in human hospitals that have re-ported isolation rates of 11.7% to 29%. 17Health care personnel may carry bacteria on their hands,under rings, or on stethoscopes, but fecal carriage bystaff is rare. High rates of infection can be isolatedfrom stalls (hospital rooms), scales, thermometers,and surgical preparation room. 17C. difcile has also been implicated in an outbreak of colitis.17,18When established in the colon, pathogenic strains ofC. difcile produce toxins that cause diarrhea and colitis. Strains that do not produce toxins are not pathogenic. Two large exotoxins, toxin A (en- terotoxin) and toxin B (cytotoxin) are produced by C. difcile. Toxins A and B appear to act synergisti- cally which cause fluid secretion, mucosal damage, and intestinal inflammation. Toxin A is also a che-moattractant for human neutrophils in vitro. 19 A third toxin, an actin-specic ADP-robosyltrans-ferase (binary toxin), has been identied in certainstrains of C. difcile isolated from human patients. The role and the pathogenesis of binary toxin isunclear, but it may act synergistically with toxins Aand B. 20,21The toxic effects appear to follow bind- ing of toxins to membrane receptors. After bindingto its intestinal receptor, Toxin A enters the cell andalters the actin cytoskeleton, leading to cell round-ing. Toxin B causes the identical rounding. In human medicine, difcile is generally acquired in the hospital setting. Neonatal colonization iscommon but almost invariably asymptomatic de-spite stool cytotoxin levels may be similar to those inadults with severe colitis. Over 50% of healthy hu-man infants have transient colonies of toxicogenic C. difcile. Baverud al 22demonstrated that nei- ther C. difcile or cytotoxin B was found in the fecal flora of 56 healthy foals (14 days to 4 months of age)not being treated with antibiotics. Similarly, asmall percentage of foals are reported to be asymp-tomatic carriers with reported rates ranging from0% to 3%. Reported rates of asymptomatic carriersin adult horse populations are very similar to that ofhumans (/H110211% to 15% of healthy adults) range from0% to 4%. 6,20This organism, therefore, is most likely a minor and uncommon component of theusual gastrointestinal tract flora. Diarrhea and fa-tal to withtoxigenic strains of C. difcile, and C. difcile may be a primary pathogen in foals, not requiring priorantimicrobial use for development of the disease. 20 Clinical Presentation Clinical presentation of C. difcile in foals range from low-grade diarrhea to fulminate colitis withileus. The foals with severe colitis become anorexicand dehydrated. In addition to the diarrhea, foalsbecome tachypneic, which may be, secondary to dis-comfort associated with the enteritis, pyrexia, met-abolic acidosis, or the anxiety of being in thehospital. Hypoproteinemia is also a feature of C. difcile secondary to the effects of toxins A and B leading to extravasation of plasma proteins. Met- abolic acidosis is tractloss be at-tributable to the gastrointestinal tract losses, aswell as to an excess of free water associated withwater consumption by these foals. 218 2020 /H11408Vol. toxins in the stool. Fecal PCR that incorporates primers for genes of toxins A and B can also be utilized. Thecytotoxin assay that uses tissue cell culture hadbeen the gold standard for diagnosis. It is the mostsensitive test (sensitivity, 94% to 100%; and speci-city, 90%), detecting as little as 10 pg of toxin B(this test is not used commonly because it is timeconsuming and expensive). Two enzyme immuno-assays have been introduced that 1) detect difcile TOX A/B test, Techlab, Blacks- burg VA) or 2) detect antigen of C. difcile and toxin A (TRIAGE \u00aeMicro; BIOSITE, San Diego CA 1-888- BIOSITE). These tests have good sensitivity(69% A/B test, Techlab has been validated for use in feces of horses. 23PCR that incorporates primers to detect the genes for Toxin A and Toxin Bcan be used for diagnosis. The author has conducted a study evaluating fecal samples that were C. difcile ELISA antigen posi- tive and toxin negative compared to culture. Inthat study a 54% toxigenic (conrmed with PCR ofthe culture) recovery rate of C. difcile from antigen positive, toxin negative samples is similar to the63% rate from a recent study of humans, 24and these results can represent a diagnostic challenge. Over-diagnosis can lead to failure to investigate the truecause or unnecessary treatment, while underdiag-nosis may result in missed treatment and infectioncontrol intervention opportunities. These resultsindicate that the presence of toxigenic C. difcile was not uncommon in those samples, suggesting theresults were due to lower sensitivity of the toxinELISA compared to the antigen ELISA or lack ofproduction of toxins in the gut. Differentiatingthese two is difcult. While the clinical relevanceof antigen positive, toxin negative results needs fur-ther study. Foals in this study all had enteritisthat could be consistent with CDI, and few had otherpotential causes of disease identied. As a diseasethat is potentially treatable and a pathogen withinfection control concerns, the presence of toxigenicC. difcile in a foal with signs consistent with CDI likely warrants treatment and use of appropriateinfection control measures. Therefore, in the pres-ence of clinical signs consistent with CDI in horses,it is prudent to consider an antigen-positive, toxin-negative result to be supportive of CDI. 24 Treatment Treatment in managing diarrhea and colitis withconrmed or suspected CDI is to discontinue antibi-otic therapy, if possible. Specic therapy is aimedat eradicating C. difcile from the intestinal tract. Oral metronidazole is the drug of rst choice. Foalsless than 6 months of age are dosed at 10 to 15 mg/kgq12h to q8h. 25The response rate for C. difcile in patients (humans) taking metronidazole is 98%.Patients who cannot tolerate oral medication be-cause of an ileus may either receive the same doseper rectum or can be effectively treated with intra-venous metronidazole at 10 mg/kg q8h to bile inflamed colon results in bactericidal levels inthe feces. 19Metronidazole resistant strains of C. difcile have been isolated, and there are even re- ports of metronidazole inducing colitis. It is recom-mended that treatment be continued for 5 days pastthe resolution date of the diarrhea. A substantialnumber of human patients (10% to 20%) will have arelapse of C. difcile diarrhea. Various other ap- proaches have been suggested for the managementof relapses, including slow tapering of metronidazoletherapy, bacteriotherapy with the use of nasogastricfecal transfaunation or fecal enemas, oral adminis-tration of nontoxigenic C. difcile, and treatment with the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii (may com- pete with C. difcile toxin A for binding sites on the intestinal epithelium). 26Saccharomyces boulardii anecdotally can be given to a foal at a dose rate of 5billion colony-forming units orally 2 times a day.One novel treatment plan currently used as an ad-junctive treatment for both viral and bacterialcauses of diarrhea is the use of Bentonite clay.Bentonite is effective because it bonds to a variety oftoxins and prevents the absorption of toxins by coat-ing the intestinal wall. 27There is a hyperimmu- nized Clostridium difcle Toxin A and B plasma that is currently available.eThe efcacy of the plasma in resolving diarrhea/toxic insult is cur-rently anecdotal. 5. C. perfringens C. perfringens is a relatively ubiquitous bacterium that has been associated with enteric diseases in anumber of diverse species. 28It is widespread in the soil and is found in the alimentary tract of nearly allwarm-blooded species. C. perfringens is a of bloating cadavers. one must becautious about drawing conclusions based on thepresence of the organisms in the tissues of theseanimals. Types of C. perfringens are differentiated (5 major types A, B, C, D, and E) based on theproduction of 4 major toxins; alpha, beta, epsilon,and iota. In addition, isolates may have the toxingenes known as CPE and NetF. It is produced bysporulating cells in an alkaline environment and isreleased upon lysis of these cells. It is resistant toproteolytic enzymes and will bind and insert on thebrush border membrane causing pore formation incells leading ultimately to cell lysis. Enterotoxincan be produced by all types of C. perfringens but is most commonly associated with type A. Many fac-tors are involved in the production of enterotoxin byC. perfringens. In one study, the prevalence of CPEin feces of adult horses with diarrhea was 16% anddetected in only 10% of the horses with colic regard-less of whether or not they had diarrhea. 29Studies AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 219IN-DEPTH: NEONATOLOGYinvestigating CPE in feces of adult horses and foals with diarrhea have produced variable results. CPEhas been detected in the feces of 7% to 33% of adulthorses with diarrhea and 28% of the foals with di-arrhea. 28-30Furthermore, out of 843 C. perfrin- gens type A isolates from dogs, people, and horses that were genotyped, only 62 (7.3%) contained theCPE gene. 30 Other toxins have been described associated with an unassigned type of C. perfringens that produces alpha-toxin and a /H92522-toxin was described.31It was isolated from piglets with necrotic enterocolitis andwas also found in horses with enterocolitis. Sincethe alpha toxin, which is produced by all types of C. perfringens including non-pathogenic type A strains, is not considered a primary cause of digestive le-sions, it was suggested that the /H92522-toxin, which is present in this new type of C . perfringens, is respon- sible for the lesions. In one study31/H92522-toxin was found in 52% of the horses with typical and atypicaltyphlocolitis. To a lesser extent, they were alsoisolated from horses with other intestinal disorders,in which they represented 37% of the isolates.No /H92522-toxinigenic C. perfringens has been found in healthy horses or in horses hospitalized for reasonsother than intestinal problems. 31Recently, a novel spore-forming toxin NetF been strongly foal-necrotizing enteritis. 32 Pathogenesis Pathogenesis of C. perfringens is based on their pro- duction of one or more of the 4 major exotoxins orenterotoxin. The factors that lead to the develop-ment of disease are not clear, but it is believed thatthere is an alteration of the normal flora that allowsovergrowth of the clostridia. Proposed causes in-clude diet changes, antibiotic therapy, stress, or con-current infection. In adult ponies, enterocolitis hasbeen produced when antibiotics (clindamycin or lin-comycin) were given to the animals orally with afecal cocktail containing clostridium. 33However, fecal cocktail alone did not cause disease. Otherfactors that may play a role in the development arehost factors such as age, immunity, and the presenceor absence of intestinal receptors for the perfringenstoxins. Beta toxin-producing types of C. perfrin- gens (Type C) appear to cause enterocolitis in neo- natal animals only. The digestive enzyme by older animals and can inactivate thetoxin. Neonatal animals have a less developed di-gestive enzyme production, thus may be more sus-ceptible to disease caused by this toxin. 33Most of the affected foals in one study had serum IgG con-centrations of /H11022800 mg/dL, indicating adequate passive nding helps support a the-ory that trypsin inhibitor in the dam's colostrum,which protects immunoglobulins from gastrointesti-nal breakdown, may potentially allow C. perfringens type C /H9252-toxin to persist in foals with adequate passive transfer and may allow type C bacteria toovergrow.Clinical Appearance Clinical appearance of the disease is usually associ-ated with foals /H110215 days of age with a history of being obtunded, colicky, and/or having diarrhea forless than 24 hours. The animals usually presentdehydrated with a severe colitis. Some of the ani-mals may develop an ileus with evidence of bothidentication of toxins and isolation of the organism from intestinal contents. Isolation of the organismwithout the analysis for toxins is considered inap-propriate because of the possibility of isolating anon-enterotoxigenic C. perfringens type A which can be isolated from normal horses' manure. In a pop-ulation study of fecal shedding of C. perfringens in 128 broodmares and foals, C. perfringens type 12% with the /H92522-toxin gene isolated; C. perfrin- gens with the enterotoxin gene was identied in 2.1% of samples, and C. perfringens type C was identied in /H110211% of the samples. A presumptive diagnosis may be made (until culture and toxin anal-ysis) by demonstration of abundant gram-positivebacteria in a fecal smear. However, this test didnot appear to be sensitive because C. perfringens was isolated from 59% of samples in which no gram-positive rods were seen. 34The diagnosis is sup- ported by culture of fecal clostridia and furtherverify the isolates as C. perfringens by the use of a polymerase chain reaction method that incorporatedprimers that allowed for classication of C. perfrin- gens types A, B, C, D, and E, as well as genes for /H92522-toxin and enterotoxin (CPE). However, toxin detection kits are commercially available for identi-cation of CPE (C. perfringens enterotoxin test, Treatment Treatment for neonatal C. perfringens is considered a medical emergency. Even with the best care,many foals can die if infected with C. perfringens type C. Neonates with clostridiosis are at a higherrisk for the development of peritonitis. When thereis a large volume of peritoneal exudate, the progno-sis is grave, and euthanasia would be recommended.If attempted, the treatment plan should be aggres-sive and aimed at the following areas: abdominalpain, septic shock, clostridial infection and toxinproduction, and maintenance of nutrition. The useof oral metronidazole 10 to 15 mg/kg 3 to 4 timesdaily (dose depends on severity) for foals and 15mg/kg 3 to 4 times daily for adults. If the animalhas an ileus and is intolerant of oral feeding, thenthe use of intravenous metronidazole is recom-mended at a dose of 10 mg/kg IV 4 times daily.Should the foal develop an ileus with marked colonicdistention, the author has used neostigmine 1 to 2mg (2 mg for foals greater than 250 pounds) SQ withgood clinical response. So far subjectively, foals 220 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: NEONATOLOGYgiven the hyperimmunized plasma appeared to have their manure become formed faster than the pa-tients not treated with the plasma. Bentonite clay can also be used for treatment since it has been shown to adsorb Clostridium perfringens alpha, beta, and beta-2 exotoxins without interfering with absorption equine colos-tral antibodies. 35 Numerous prophylactic measures can be insti- tuted on farms with a history of C. perfringens- associated enterocolitis in foals. Optimal hygieneefforts to ensure cleanliness of the foaling stall andthe mare (clean udder before and after birth, cleanthe perineal and hind-limb region) at parturitionshould be undertaken to decrease the degree of ex-posure of the foal to pathogens in the feces. 36Some farms have stopped their outbreak of foal diarrheaby foaling the mares out in pasture. S pecic pre- ventative methods addressing C. perfringens in- clude immunizing mares with the use of a toxoidvaccine (aluminum hydroxide-adsorbed culturesupernatant plus recombinant /H92522-toxoid). The vaccine strain is a C. perfringens Type A that carries genes for Alpha, /H92522, NetF, and CPE that has been developed (2007) by Equine Medical Insti-tute. Other oral enteric protectants include theoral and/or administration of hyperimmunizedplasma, which was previously mentioned. Specicimmune treatments for C. perfringens types C and D do provide some protection against alpha-toxin, butit is generally believed that this protection would beinadequate against C. perfringens type A organisms. 6. Salmonella Salmonella are gram negative, facultative, anaero- bic bacteria, which usually can access the intestinaltract via the fecal-oral route. Salmonella com- monly infects foals between 12 hours and 4 monthsof age. Young animals are more susceptible to Sal- monella infections maybe because of a less sophisti- cated or less well established microflora within thegastrointestinal tract. The most common source ofexposure and infection in the foal is another horse.Often, the mare herself is an asymptomatic carrier.Mares have been shown to shed Salmonella at or shortly after parturition despite having as many as19 negative cultures before foaling. 37Observations of foalings revealed that all mares defecate duringstage 2 labor and that contamination of fetal mem-branes and the perineum/udder of the mare waspossible if Salmonella was in the feces. During udder-seeking, the newborn foals will have exten-sive contact with the perineum and therefore may beat risk of Salmonella ingestion. Once Salmonella has overcome the host defense mechanisms (gastric acidity, intestinal flora, peri-stalsis, intestinal mucus, and lactoferrin) the bacte-ria migrate through the and accessthe lamina propria where they stimulate an inflam-matory response. Both phagocytized and free Sal- monella organisms travel via the lymphatics toregional lymph nodes where they persist in stimu-lating an inflammatory response. Salmonella canalso reach circulation from efferent lymphatics.The neonate predisposition toward bacteremia andsepticemia may be because of factors such as de-layed gut closure at birth, immature cellular im-mune response and decreased complement activity.Salmonella enterotoxins, cytotoxins, and general- ized inflammation within the bowel induces secre-tions of fluid from the intestinal epithelium. Clinical Signs Clinical signs of Salmonellosis are variable and can range from mild enteritis to severe septicemic shock.Diagnosis of Salmonella is demonstrated by a posi- tive fecal or blood cultures. The author has seenfoals present with fevers of unknown origin with nosigns of diarrhea that have had positive blood andfecal cultures for Salmonella. Intermittent shed- ding of Salmonella is common and therefore a min- imum of 3 to 5 consecutive 1-gram fecal culturestaken 24 hours apart are recommended. Treatment Treatment for salmonella is nonspecic and is aimedat maintaining hydration and electrolyte balance.Antibiotic therapy, even though it does not alter theclinical course of diarrhea or shedding of the organ-isms, should be initiated in foals to help been shown to reduce the effects ofendotoxemia. Bismuth subsalicylate (1 to 3 mL/kgPO q4-8h) is also commonly used as a gastropro-tectant secondary to its endotoxic and antiprosta-glandin properties. J-5 plasma may also be givento aid in decreasing the systemic endotoxin level. Prevention Prevention of Salmonella consists of proper hygiene. Before the foal is able to nurse, the udder and peri-neal regions of the mare are to be thoroughlywashed with dilute chlorohexidine or ivory soap andwater. During an outbreak situation, foals shouldalso be intubated with 6 to 8 oz of colostrum prior tocontact with the mare. An experimental inactivated bacterin ( Salmonella typhimurium and Newport ) vaccine has oped by Hagyard Equine Medical Institute and Dr.John Timoney at the Gluck Research Center in Lex-ington, KY. This vaccine has been used on endemicfarms since 2007. 7. E. durans (Group D Streptococcus) E. durans is a gram-positive coccus in the alimen- tary tract that has been implicated as a cause ofenteritis in foals, piglets, calves, and puppies. Theauthor has documented E. durans as a cause of diarrhea in 5 of 7 foals that had developed diarrheaduring the rst 10 days of life. 38In one study con- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 221IN-DEPTH: NEONATOLOGYducted in Australia, E. durans (isolated from a foal that had severe diarrhea) was experimentally in- fected in 7 foals (via stomach tube). All 7 foalsdeveloped profuse watery diarrhea within 24 hoursof inoculation with varying degrees of depression,anorexia, abdominal tenderness, and dehydration. 39 The pathogenesis of diarrhea and enteric diseaseremains unknown. Diarrhea induced by E. durans is not associated with enterotoxin production or sub-stantial mucosal injury. However, decreased activ-ity of brush border digestive enzymes such aslactase and alkaline phosphatase suggest that thereis a direct mechanical interference with digestionand absorption at the brush border. 39 Treatment Treatment for E. durans has not been adequately investigated but subjectively the /H9252-lactams appear to help decrease the duration of the diarrhea (ampi-cillin or penicillin). The ideal treatment is to im-prove husbandry on the farm. Formulating a Diagnostic Plan The goal of the diagnostic plan for detecting patho- genic organisms is 3-fold. 1. Can we detect a pathogenic organism (qual- itative testing)? 2. If a pathogenic organism is detected, then how much is present (quantication)? 3. If a pathogenic organism is detected, then identify it and if it is a bacterial organism,what is the antibiogram? Methods utilized for pathogen detection for foal di-arrhea may include microscopy, culture, immuno-logical methods (ELISA), and molecular methods(PCR). The effectiveness of a proper diagnosticplan depends on the appropriate sample collection.Clinicians must be cognitive of safety precautionswhen collecting the fecal sample. The fecal sam-ples should be at a minimum of 1 gram (size of anaverage adult's thumb nail) or 4 fecal swabs withadequate manure staining of the swabs. All sam-ple collections should be collected while wearinggloves and placed in a leak-proof container to pre-vent environmental contamination during trans-port. Most pathogens resulting in foal diarrhea cancause a wide spectrum of overlapping clinical syn-dromes that make it difcult for the clinician todecide which organism(s) they test for in the feces.PCR is a molecular technique for the amplication ofa DNA fragment via enzymatic replication. PCRhas many advantages over conventional laboratorydiagnostic techniques because it offers results thatare quick, accurate, and affordable with high sensi-tivity and high specicity. Multiplex PCR is cur-rently available that offers testing for a variety ofenteric pathogens in just one fecal sample with aquick turnaround. The author prefers the use of amultiplex PCR over the use of single pathogen test-ing because a study has documented that the rate of coinfections as a cause for diarrhea in foals in cen-tral Kentucky is not uncommon. 12If a veterinarian is in a situation where there are multiple cases ofdiarrhea occurring on a farm, they could pool thefecal samples in order to save money and perform amultiplex PCR for enteric pathogens. If a pathogenis detected then it can be assumed the pathogen thatwas detected is the causative agent. The authorroutinely performs fecal pooled testing for entericpathogens and acknowledges that pooling fecal sam-ples for equine enteric pathogens has been validatedonly for Salmonella enterica and not the other pathogens. 39 8. Conclusion Equine practitioners have always considered theavailability of a correct etiologic diagnosis, particu-larly in contagious infections, to make early deci-sions on the patient's care and management, toaddress appropriate treatment, and to allow timelynotication and discussion of management issuesregarding prevention of disease spread a priority.Over the past years, both the understanding andcharacterization of existing and new equine infec-tious agents as well as the development of rapid,comprehensive, and affordable molecular diagnostictools has experienced a rapid development. Recentadvances in diagnostic technology have allowed forthe development of various Equine Point of Carediagnostics (EPOCD). EPOCDs are able to achieveresults in less than an hour and in some instances inless than a minute. Advantages of EPOCD for theequine practitioner would be to treat faster with testresults while reducing the initial guess work andoffering the patient optimal care with the end goal ofbetter clinical outcomes. Several PCR Point ofCare (POC) systems have recently entered the vet-erinary market. Companies such as Fluxergy LLC(Irvine, PCR assays.Credo's QubeMDx PCR does not offer any equinetesting at this time but does offer canine and feline infectious disease testing. Fluxergy is unique inthat they have been concentrating on primarilyequine PCR POC technology. These advances willnot only help practitioners make an accurate diag-nosis but will be utilized to discover new pathogensaffecting the foal's alimentary tract.

Introduction Synovitis is a major feature of osteoarthritis, character- ized by macrophage-driven inflammation. Synovialmacrophages are essential for joint health; however, theybecome pro-inflammatory (M1) when their homeostatic(M2) functions are overwhelmed. Bone marrow mono-nuclear cells (BMNCs) are a rich source of macrophagesused to treat chronic inflammation and produce essentialmolecules for cartilage metabolism. This study investi-gated the response of normal and inflamed joints to au-tologous BMNC injection. 2. Materials and Methods Synovitis was induced (0.5 ng lipopolysaccharide [LPS]/joint) in both radiocarpal joints of six horses. After 8 h,one inflamed radiocarpal and one normal tarsocruraljoint received a BMNC (20 million cells/joint).Contralateral joints received saline. Synovial fluid wascollected at 1, 4, and 6 days for cytology, cytokine quan-tication, and flow cytometry. At 6 days, horses wereeuthanatized, joints evaluated, and synovium harvested.Data were analyzed using the General Estimating Equa-tions. Signicance was set at P/H110210.05. 3. Results Gross and analytical improvements in synovial fluidand membrane were observed in inflamed jointstreated with BMNC to saline 10%higher (Fig. 1). 4. Discussion BMNC-treated joints were ultimately comparableto healthy joints regarding histochemical pat-terns, which remained abnormally high in saline-treated controls, suggesting BMNCs provide 224 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSSPORTS MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION Research Abstract /L50093for more information, contact the corresponding author.

In healthy joints, macrophagesare central promoters of synovial health, but they be-come inflammatory (M1) when homeostatic functions(M2) become overwhelmed. Bone marrow mononu-clear cells (BMNCs) are a rich source of macrophageprogenitors that elicit an anti-inflammatory/pro-resolving response and promote the endogenous reso-lution of experimentally induced synovitis. The aimof this study was to evaluate the ability of intra-artic-ular BMNC therapy to improve clinical signs of natu-rally occurring equine OA. 2. Materials and Methods Horses presenting with clinical and radiographic evi-dence of moderate OA in a single joint were randomlyassigned to 1 of 3 treatments: saline (negative con-trol), triamcinolone (positive control), or BMNC (treat-ment group). Horses were evaluated for lameness(subjectively and objectively) and synovial fluid col-lected (cytology and cytokine/growth factor quantica-tion) at 0, and 7, and 21 days post-injection. Datawere analyzed using general estimating equations.Signicance was set at P/H110210.05. 3. Results No adverse effects were observed. Lameness decreasedin all groups over the study period but only signicantlyin the BMNC-treated group (between days 7 and 21) andnot in the saline or triamcinolone groups. 4.

Introduction The National Institutes of Health reports that up to 80% of humans experience lower back pain at somepoint during their adult life. In horses, the re-ported prevalence of back pain and/or dysfunctionvaries dramatically, from 0.9% 1to 94%,2and seems to be more common in lame horses. A study ofpredominantly English performance horses foundback pain in 32% of 805 lame horses compared withonly 12% of 339 control horses. 3In cutting horses, 70% of 140 horses that presented to a UniversityHospital for lameness or poor performance werefound to have thoracolumbar back pain. 4Consid- ering the prevalence and increasing focus on backpain among the equine veterinary community, 5it is important to explore ways to successfully treat, re-habilitate, and restore function to horses with backpain and/or dysfunction. Similar to treating hu-mans with lower back pain, the principles of treat-ing back pain and dysfunction in horses consists ofrst, breaking the pain cycle; and second, increasingand/or restoring muscle strength and function of theback. This paper will explore various methods andtechniques to achieve these goals. It is importantto state that while the focus of this paper is not ondiagnosing back pain, that an accurate diagnosis isparamount to successful management of back paincases.2. Materials and Methods Breaking the Pain Cycle Breaking the pain cycle is arguably the most impor- tant feature of managing back pain (genericallyreferring to pain and/or dysfunction of the thoraco-lumbar, lumbosacral, and/or sacroiliac [SI] regions),as it is the gateway that allows for building corestrength and restoring proper function. Anti-Inflammatory Medications In humans, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medi- cations (NSAIDs) are considered an effective treat-ment lower back pain. 6However, in the author's opinion, NSAIDs rarely provide sufcientpain relief in horses with back pain and corticoste-roids seem to be a more effective anti-inflammatorymedication. While corticosteroids can of coursebe administered systemically (e.g., 1 mg/kg pred-nisolone PO q24h), conventional reasoning and com-mon practice is to deliver the corticosteroids as closeto the site of pathology as possible. Therefore, thedelivery method for corticosteroid therapy dependson the underlying pathology. Horses suffering from impinging over-riding saline to increase the injectionvolume as needed (/H110112 mL per site), around the 232 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSSPORTS MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION NOTESaffected spinous processes. One study found that corticosteroid inltration resolved the pain in 89% of38 horses with kissing spines, although 56% of thosehad recurrence of pain in /H110211 year 7and repeating this treatment once or twice a year is often neces-sary. 8In cases of thoracolumbar osteoarthritis, corticosteroid injection of the articular facet jointscan be performed using ultrasound guidance. 9The author prefers triamcinolone ( /H110113 mg/ joint, up to 18 mg total body dose) diluted to 2 mL volume withsterile saline or hyaluronic acid. A less specic al-ternative, and one that does not require ultrasoundguidance yet is still clinically effective, is to performan intramuscular corticosteroid injection (of themultidus or longissimus muscle) in the region ofthe affected facet joints. The author has only per-formed this in a small proportion of horses usingtriamcinolone though others may use methylpred-nisolone or isoflupredone. While theoreticallymethylprednisolone could lead to mineralization ofthe soft tissues, the author has not appreciated thisclinically. In humans, injection of methylpred-nisolone into the multidus muscle was more effec-tive in treating lower back pain than a 10-weekphysiotherapy program. 10 Horses with clinical evidence of SI pain typically benet greatly from corticosteroid injections of thatregion. Interestingly, response to treatment is notcorrelated with the presence or absence of pathologicchanges of the SI joint identied with diagnosticimaging a. There are multiple published techniques for injecting the SI joints.11,12Regardless of tech- nique, it should be noted that the SI joint contains avery small volume of synovial fluid ( /H110111m L ) 13and an SI \"joint\" injection is a bit of a misnomer as theinjection is almost exclusively periarticular. 11For SI region injections, the author prefers to inject afairly large volume using the cranial ultrasound-guided approach (typically 100 mg methylpred-nisolone diluted to 15-20 mL in sterile saline perside); the cranial approach avoids the risk of pene-trating the rectum as is possible using the caudalapproach 12and the higher volume ensures diffusion to the cranial and caudal aspects of the joint as wellas the surrounding structures. In cases in whichcorticosteroid therapy is contraindicated, injectionof autologous conditioned serum has yielded goodclinical effects, anecdotally, in a handful of horses. Generally speaking, adverse reactions are uncom- mon, but a minority of horses will have some in-crease in muscle pain and spasm following intra-articular facet joint injection or SI region injectionsat the site of needle placement. In these cases, theauthor prescribes hot packing (apply a warm com-press, 20 minutes, and a centrally acting muscle relaxer used to decrease muscle spasms and excessive mus-cle tone (hypertonicity). One of the rst reports ofsuch use dates back to 1958 when a human physi-cian reported \"often prompt and striking\" results inpatients with acute orthopedic conditions, includingherniated lumbar and cervical disks. 14In a double blinded, placebo-controlled study, treatment withmethocarbamol was effective in 70% of 98 peoplewith acute lower back pain and spasm. 15Like the 30% of people in the aforementioned study whowere \"non-responders,\" so too in horses there seemsto be variable efcacy (from negligible to quite effec-tive). In the majority of cases, the author appreci-ates a good clinical result from administration of 25mg/kg q12h PO for 2 weeks followed by 25 mg/kgonce daily for an additional 2 weeks. In cases withunderlying back pathology, it is most effective whenadministered in conjunction with an initial cortico-steroid treatment of the back and/or SI region.However, in more mild cases of thoracolumbarepaxial muscle pain, it can be used effectively inisolation, as a sole treatment. Methocarbamol isgenerally safe but rarely can cause drowsiness.It is important to note that the above dose is notlegal under United State Equestrian Federation(USEF) drug regulations, which restricts its use to 5mg/lb (11 mg/kg) every 24 hours for no more than 5consecutive days. Bisphosphonates Despite the widespread clinical use of bisphospho- nates to treat horses with osseous pathology of thethoracolumbar spine, the supporting research isextremely limited. A single study reports on theoutcome of 29 horses with osteoarthritis of the tho-racolumbar vertebrae, with or without concurrentosseous changes of the spinous processes. 16The treatment group (consisting of 15 horses, each ad-ministered a single treatment of 1 mg/kg tiludro-nate in 1 L saline via slow IV infusion) hadsignicantly better dorsal flexion of the back incanter compared with the control group 60 daysfollowing treatment. At 120 days, treated horsesshowed improvement over the control horses, butthe difference between the groups was not statis-tically signicant. Another clinical study demon-strated decreased lameness scores in horses withdistal hock joint osteoarthritis 60 days after treat-ment with tiludronate (same dosing protocol asabove). 17These reports, in combination with the FDA-approved use for the treatment of navic-ular syndrome in adult horses, make the use ofbisphosphonates for other osseous pathologic con-ditions a reasonable choice. Thus, in cases ofosteoarthritis of the axial skeleton and/or kissingspine, judicious use of bisphosphonates could beconsidered. treating clodronate, ortiludronate constitutes off-label use. Bisphospho-nates are not approved for use in young ( /H110214 years old), pregnant, or lactating mares and can cause AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 233SPORTS MEDICINE AND REHABILITATIONcolic-like symptoms, although this seems to be more common with tiludronate than clodronate. Clodro-nate has infrequently been associated with acuterenal failure and therefore should not be given in theface of abnormal serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN)or creatinine levels, nor should it be given in con-junction with NSAIDs. Clodronate appears to bethe more widely used bisphosphonate in the UnitedStates, likely due to the ease of administration, thecost, and the infrequency of negative side effects.However, how the efcacy of clodronate compares tothat of tiludronate, especially in the treatment ofthoracolumbar conditions, is unknown. Mesotherapy Mesotherapy is a technique that began in human medicine in the 1950s that involves multiple, small-volume subdermal injections of analgesic and/oranti-inflammatory medications. One study in hu-mans (n /H1100584) demonstrated that mesotherapy (consisting of lidocaine, ketoprofen, and methylpred-nisolone injected at days 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13) was, atless than half the dose, as effective as systemic ad-ministration of the same medications for treatinglower back pain. 18In horses with thoracolumbar pain, the injections are typically administered inthree parallel rows, on either side of the spine (Fig.1). There are a variety of \"cocktails\" used by prac-titioners; the author prefers a combination of mepi-vacaine, flumethasone, and traumeel diluted insaline. Injection of methylprednisolone in meso-therapy should be avoided due to anecdotal reportsthat the hair at the injection sites can turn white.Like many treatments for the lower back and pelvis,mesotherapy is often insufcient when used in iso-lation, but it can be very useful as an adjunct ther-apy, in combination with other treatments, and/oras a way to lengthen the time required betweenmore aggressive therapies such as intra-articularinjections. The author has not experienced any ad-verse effects with mesotherapy but is aware of onehorse that developed diffuse, painful subcutaneousedema throughout the thoracolumbar epaxial regionafter being treated weeklyfor 3 weeks. Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy Shockwave therapy is another very useful adjunct therapy that, until recently, was being used basedon the positive effects reported anecdotally. A re-cent study reported the effects of shockwave therapyon a group (n /H1100512) of riding horses with thoraco- lumbar back pain. 19Treatment consisted of 1500 pulses applied to the epaxial muscles from T12through L5 with an 80-mm trode at an E4 energysetting, and was performed 3 times, spaced every 14days. The authors found a signicant and clini-cally relevant increase in mechanical nociceptivethreshold (MNT), measured with pressure algome-try along the thoracolumbar epaxial muscle, 7 daysfollowing the second and third treatments, but notafter the rst treatment. Interestingly, the in-creased MNT persisted for at least 1 month follow-ing the last treatment. In contrast to the results of this study, in clinical practice, many practitioners report signicantly de-creased back pain following even a single treatment ofshockwave therapy. It is a good option for treatingmuscle pain that may develop in the interim betweencorticosteroid injections, and should be strongly con-sidered as an alternate treatment for horses that can-not receive corticosteroid injections (e.g., for metabolicreasons or due to competition drug regulations). Ad-ditionally, it is a safe and non-invasive treatment, withfew to no reported side effects. It is also a good rst-line treatment, but in the author's practice the cost oftreatment is sometimes prohibitive. The author typ-ically treats the thoracolumbar epaxial muscles asneeded with a total of 1500 to 2000 pulses, half deliv-ered with a 35-mm probe and half with an 80-mmprobe, to try and target both supercial and deeperpain. Shockwave cannot be used within 5 days ofFe\u00b4de\u00b4ration Equestre Internationale (FEI) competition. Under USEF guidelines, shockwave of the back spe-cically (but not elsewhere on the body) is permitted/H1102212 hours before competition. Laser Therapy In general, the scientic evidence for the efcacy of laser therapy in the treatment of musculoskeletalconditions is lacking. However, a recent studyinvestigated the outcome of laser therapy in activelycompeting horses. 20Sixty-one Quarter Horses with acute lower back pain were treated with low-level laser therapy (series of 3 treatments over 5 to7 days), chiropractic, or a combination of both.Horses treated with laser alone had decreased epax-ial muscle pain, trunk stiffness, and muscle hyper-tonicity lending support toward the use of laser to Fig. 1. Photograph of the right side of a horse following meso- therapy treatment. Note the parallel rows of subdermal injec-tions along the thoracolumbar epaxial /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSSPORTS MEDICINE AND REHABILITATIONtreat lower back pain. An advantage to this treat- ment is that it is non-invasive and, in the case oflower-level laser therapy, can be performed byowners. Integrative Therapies Acupuncture and chiropractic treatments can be ef- fective adjunct therapies. Acupuncture mitigatespain through release of local neuropeptides thatstimulate systemic release of endogenous opioids,serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. A studyof 15 horses with chronic lower back pain evaluatedthe effects of electroacupuncture (administeredevery 3 days for 5 treatments) compared withtreatment with an oral NSAID (2.2 mg/kg phenylb-utazone PO q12h) to saline lumbar pain was not signicantly altered in thephenylbutazone or control groups, but was signi-cantly decreased following 3 electroacupuncturetreatments and the analgesic effects lasted up to 2weeks. Acupuncture is generally well toleratedthough in cases with severe thoracolumbar pain,hypertonicity and/or wind-up, acupuncture maynot be tolerated. In such cases, acupuncture canoften be used in subsequent visits once the pain levelhas been dampened with use of other rst-linetreatments. Chiropractic treatment can be used to restore nor- mal spinal motion and functional mobility and candecrease muscle spasm, nerve dysfunction, and painthat can occur as a result of joint hypomobility. 22 In a study of horses without back pain (n /H1100538), a single chiropractic treatment increased the MNT by27% for up to 7 days post-treatment whereas mas-sage therapy and phenylbutazone treatment in-creased 12% and 8%, respectively. 23 Kinesiotape Kinesiotape, or elastic athletic tape, has many pur- ported mechanisms of action including stimulatingproprioceptive pathways, increasing lymphatic flow,providing stability, and enhancing or inhibitingmuscle function, but overall, there is limited evi-dence in the literature to support such claims.The human literature is conflicting regarding theefcacy of kinesiotape and a single study in horses(n/H110058) did not show an alteration in thoracolumbar flexion-extension range of motion when kinesiotapewas applied to the abdominal muscles. 24Nonethe- less, kinesiotape is widely used in both human andequine athletes. In the author's practice, kinesio-tape, applied as pictured in Fig. 2A, can be helpful toalleviate mild to moderate muscle pain and tensionof the thoracolumbar epaxial muscles; the patternincludes a base anchor strip along the thoracolum-bar midline and multiple smaller strips crossingmidline applied in such a way as to \"lift\" the skinand, in theory, reduce myofascial restriction. Al-ternatively, for focal areas of edema, as can some-times occur with pressure points from tack, tapingin a star pattern (Fig. 2A) can help reduce edema.Finally, Fig. 2B demonstrates one version of a \"sta-bility\" taping pattern that can be useful in horseswith SI pain and/or in cases of mild pelvicinstability. Fig. 2. A, This horse has kinesiotape applied in two different patterns. The pattern along the thoracolumbar midline entailsan anchor strip on crossing thethoracolumbar muscles. This pattern is commonly usedto help alleviate thoracolumbar muscle pain. A \"star\" pattern,seen over the left tuber coxae, can be applied over an area of focaledema. B, Kinesiotape applied in a \"stability pattern\" from thetuber coxae to the opposite hamstring muscles. In this case, thetape is aimed to promote pelvic stability. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 235SPORTS MEDICINE AND REHABILITATIONSurgical Treatment Surgical treatment of kissing spines is becoming increasingly common. Surgical resection of im-pinging or over-riding dorsal spinous processes wasrst described in 1968 25and is still commonly per- formed. Results following ostectomy are quitegood, with 72% (n /H11005209) to 100% (n /H110059) of horses achieving normal function in the long term. 26-29 A newer procedure that is gaining favor is interspi-nous ligament desmotomy (ISLD), which can be per-formed standing. Outcomes of ISLD surgery arecomparable (95% of 35 horses) to previously re-ported ostectomy outcomes. 7The same study showed that while horses managed medically (withcorticosteroid injections of the affected sites) andhad good short-term outcomes (89% of 34 horses),recurrence of back pain was common (19 of 34).Horses treated with ISLD were 24 times more likelyto have long-term resolution of symptoms comparedto medically managed counterparts. In the author's opinion, many cases of kissing spines can be successfully managed medically, es-pecially when coupled with core strengtheningand conditioning exercises. However, surgicaltreatment is a good option for horses that requirerepeated corticosteroid injections to maintain pro-longed comfort. If the owner would like to pursuesurgery as an initial treatment step, the authorprefers to trial corticosteroid injections once, toensure the horse has an adequate response totreatment, prior to pursuing a more invasivetreatment option. Increasing and/or Restoring Back Strength and Function After breaking the pain cycle, building core strengthand stability is essential for the long-term, success-ful management of back pain cases. Dynamic Mobilization Exercises The function of the multidus muscle as a spine stabilizer, or a vertebral motion segment stabilizer,has been demonstrated in multiple species, includ-ing horses. 30,31Atrophy and inhibition of the mul- tidus muscles is a common nding in humans withacute and subacute lower back pain 32and can de- velop quickly (within 3 days) following induced backpain in an experimental animal model. 33This cre- ates instability of the vertebral motion segment, andperpetuates the underlying condition. Addition-ally, even once the underlying pain has been treated,the multidus muscles do not spontaneously resumenormal activity. 34Exercises that target strength- ening and mobilizing the multidus muscles greatlyreduce the recurrence of back pain in humans; withtargeted exercise, recurrence decreased from 84% to30% within 1 year and from 75% to 35% over 2 to 3years. 35Thus, increasing multidus strength, symmetry and function is a major focus of managingback pain in horses. Horses (n /H110058 Arabians not in ridden work) that performed a series of core strengthening exercises(consisting of 5 sets of 3 cervical flexions, 1 cervicalextension, and 3 lateral bending exercises to the leftand right) 5 days per week for 3 months had in-creased cross-sectional area (CSA) and symmetry ofthe multidus muscles at 6 different locationsthroughout thoracolumbar back. 30Similar results were seen in Thoroughbreds in race training; thosethat underwent dynamic mobilization exercises(consisting of 10 repetitions of 3 cervical flexions, 1cervical extension, 3 lateral bending exercises to theleft and right, performed 5 days per week for 12weeks) had signicantly increased CSA of the mul-tidus muscles in as soon as 6 weeks. 36Examples of some of these exercises can be seen in Fig. 3.Additionally, the book, Activate Your Horse's Core 37 is an excellent resource for these and other corestrengthening exercises. Elastic Resistance Bands Exercises that encourage hindquarter engagement are very useful in rehabilitation of back pain andinclude resistance band training, hill work, and cav-aletti exercises. A recent study of 7 general pur-pose riding horses showed that 4 weeks' trainingwith elastic resistance bands increased dynamic sta-bility of the back. 38The exercise protocol started with familiarization to the bands in week 1 and thenprogressed to lounging and ridden work 10 minutes5 times per week, to 20 minutes 4 times per week, to30 minutes 3 times per week, in weeks 2, 3, and 4,respectively. It is proposed that the bands (Fig. 4)provide proprioceptive input that results in in-creased recruitment of the abdominal and hindquar-ters muscles during exercise. Additional Core Strengthening Exercises Gymnastic-type exercise, both in hand and on the lounge can increase core strength and thereforeshould be incorporated into the long-term manage-ment plan. As discussed above, dynamic mobiliza-tion exercises can increase the size of the multidusmuscle, but this effect can be furthered with theaddition of gymnastics exercises. Horses that per-formed gymnastic exercises (including pelvis tilts,backing, turning small circles, and walking over araised pole) 3 days per week for 3 months, in addi-tion to dynamic mobilization exercises, had moreincrease in multidus muscle CSA than horses thatperformed only dynamic mobilization exercises. 39 Considerations for cavaletti work include varying pole placement and height. Placing elevated railscloser to one another will encourage more hindlimbflexion while placing rails on the ground spaced far-ther apart results in a longer stride, with more limbprotraction. Changing the spacing and height ofthe rails can have the added benet of challengingthe proprioceptive system, as can having only oneside of the rail elevated off the ground. Backing isan additional exercise that can be considered andseems to be particularly useful for horses with SIpain. Initially, backing is performed in hand on a 236 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSSPORTS MEDICINE AND REHABILITATIONflat surface; the difculty can be increased by back- ing up an incline as the horse gets stronger. Another method to address core strength and bal- ance are balance pads adapted from human physicaltherapy. While there are equine specic products,many human products work equally well. Thehorse is asked to stand on a dense foam block withboth front, both hind, or all four limbs (Fig. 5).Firmer pads are more stable and thus less challeng-ing than soft pads, yet many horses will have dif-culty maintaining their center of balance on rmpads. Even 5 minutes a day on balance pads canresult in noticeable improvement in core balance in Fig. 3. Examples of various core strengthening exercises. A, A lateral tail pull combined with lateral bending to the right. B, A lumbosacral tuck. C, Ventral cervical flexion. Fig. 4. Example of an elastic resistance band placed around thehindquarters. These systems can be used for a variety of rea-sons but in this case was prescribed to help increase core strengthand encourage more hind-limb engagement. Fig. 5. A horse standing on balance pads in order to increasecore balance and stability. Here the horse stands on rmer(green) pads in front and softer (blue) pads behind to increase thelevel of difculty of the exercise. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 237SPORTS MEDICINE AND REHABILITATIONas little as 2 weeks, at which point the exercise can be made more difcult by decreasing the rmness ofthe pads. Softer pads require more ne motor con-trol in order to limit postural sway. Whole-body vibration (WBV) therapy is a rela- tively common modality, largely due to consumer-direct marketing, that may be useful in increasingcore strength. A non-blinded study of 9 horses ex-amined the effects of WBV on the multidus muscleand found that, following 2 months of WBV per-formed 30 minutes twice daily 5 days a week, therewas a statistically signicant increase in multidussymmetry and CSA. 40The study utilized a com- mercially available, vertical vibrating platform witha frequency of 40 Hz, amplitude of 0.8 mm, and anacceleration of 4.9 m/s 2(0.5 g). The authors pro- posed that WBV could be an alternative to dynamicmobilization exercises. It is this author's opinionthat core strengthening exercises are superior toWBV in management of back pain and that the placefor WBV is not yet well understood. 3. Results and Discussion The treatment and rehabilitation strategies pre- sented here are a culmination of experiences gainedfrom managing more than 200 cases of back pain.In the most typical case, if there is osseous pathologysuch as kissing spine and/or facet joint osteoarthri-tis, the author would start by breaking the paincycle with corticosteroid injections or shockwave ofthe affected area(s) and prescribe a course of metho-carbamol. Additionally, basic core strengtheningexercises consisting of lumbosacral tucks, ventralflexions, and lateral bending exercises are pre-scribed. At the 2-week recheck, the clinical signs(e.g., pain to of the thoracolumbar epaxialmuscles, willingness/ability to perform basic func-tional tests) are often markedly improved but, ifthere is residual pain and/or the horse displays aver-sion behaviors under saddle that are consistent withback pain, additional therapies such as shockwave,mesotherapy, acupuncture, and chiropractic treat-ment are considered. Once the initial pain is ade-quately managed, a long-term plan is implementedthat usually entails gradually increasing the dif-culty of the core strengthening exercises, addingbalance pads, and incorporating elastic resistancebands and gymnastic exercises to the trainingprogram. In cases in which corticosteroids are contraindi- cated, the author often begins treatment withshockwave of the affected area and a course ofmethocarbamol, as well as acupuncture (if not al-ready being performed) and/or kinesiotape applica-tion. Mesotherapy can also be performed withoutcorticosteroids. For horses with indication of SIjoint pain/dysfunction, the author has been verypleased with the results obtained from injection ofautologous conditioned serum ( /H110115 mL administered per side, from a cranial, ultrasound-guided ap-proach) in the handful of horses in which it has been performed. If the initial pain cycle is managed and the horse is kept in a good strength and conditioning program,many times back pain will not recur until there is aninciting cause, such as becoming cast or enduring along trailer ride. Additionally, as managing backpain relies heavily on maintaining core strength, itis common for back pain to recur when the horserequires lay-up for another injury. In the majorityof instances, adequate core strength can be main-tained with daily dynamic mobilization exercisesand/or hand-walking (if able) with elastic resistancebands. Adjunct therapies such as acupuncture, la-ser therapy, and kinesiotaope can also be benecialin mitigating back pain during periods of decreasedtraining. In summary, successful management of cases of back pain and dysfunction requires rst breakingthe pain cycle and second, maximizing core strengthand condition. Treatment of pain can be accom-plished with various medical therapies and in cer- tain cases, surgical treatment may be warranted.Rehabilitation is critical and while there is no\"one-size-ts-all\" protocol, it entails various corestrengthening and dynamic exercises.

Introduction Postural stability maintains balance, protects the spinal column, and allows accurate responses to de-stabilizing forces. The m. multidus is the majorpostural muscle located adjacent to the vertebraealong the length of the spinal column. Increasedcross-sectional area (CSA) of the m. multidus hasbeen demonstrated in horses following rehabilita-tion strengthening exercises; however, correlationwith functional postural stability has not beenshown. The current study aimed to evaluate therelationship of the thoracolumbar m. multidusCSA and measures of postural sway performance inlame horses undergoing rehabilitation exercises. 2. Materials and Methods Seven horses admitted to a rehabilitation facilitywere included in the study. M. multidus CSA wasmeasured via ultrasonography at the start of a re-habilitation program (initial evaluation) and after12 weeks of rehabilitation exercises (nal evalua-tion). Postural sway data was also measured atthese time points.3. Results A signicant increase in m. multidus CSA was seenfrom initial to nal evaluation. A moderate tostrong correlation was present between m. multi-dus CSA and postural sway variables. 4. Discussion These results suggest that there is an associationbetween postural stability and m. multidus hyper-trophy in lame horses undergoing individualized re-habilitation programs. This suggests that posturalstability can be improved by performing rehabilita-tion exercises that promote increased m. multidussize.

Introduction Horses with laminitis can experience signicant pain, which can make their management extremelychallenging, and in fact a large proportion of horseswith laminitis are euthanized because of severe, un-manageable pain. 1,2Sources of pain in the lamin- itic horse include inflammation within the laminae,increased pressure within the rigid hoof capsule,tearing and contusion of the soft tissues withinthe foot, tissue ischemia, and altered/excessive con-tact between the sole and distal phalanx. 3,4In ad- dition, horses with chronic laminitis can develop aneuropathic component to their pain, which mayoccur following neural injury. Repetitive neuro-pathic and nociceptive stimulation can lead to cen-tralsensitization, contributing to maladaptive pain. 5-8 Allodynia (pain with a normally non-noxious stim- uli) and hyperalgesia (exaggerated response to anoxious stimuli) are features of central sensitizationand can result in plasticity of the central pain path-ways, further impacting the well-being of the horse. 9,10Thus, horses with chronic laminitis can experience nociceptive and neuropathic pain whichin the absence of treatment can lead to central sen-sitization and maladaptive pain that has no value tothe animal. Because of the com plex and multifaceted patho- physiology of pain in laminitic horses, many treatmentoptions have been suggested with none being univer-sally effective. Previous reviews have listed the painmanagement options that are available for the lamin-itic horse, but evidence for their use in treating thiscomplex condition has not been described. This re-view will describe the evidence behind pharmaceuticaland nonpharmaceutical-based pain management op-tions in the horse with laminitis. 2. Pharmaceutical Treatment Options Since studies specic to laminitis are limited, broad-based evidence for included drugs and therapeuticmodalities is also presented where available, allow-ing the reader to consider the sum total of literature AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 243SPORTS MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION NOTESwhen developing a therapeutic plan. To help guide this, treatment options for horses with acute versuschronic laminitis are listed in Table 1. Case exam-ples as to how these treatment options can be ap-plied are included in the text and reported drugdosages are listed in Table 2. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Mechanism of action: Non-steroidal anti-inflamma- oxidative of can help decrease pe - ripheral by products of ara-chidonic acid metabolism (prostaglandins andleukotrienes). 12There is also evidence that NSAIDs may help with pain due to inhibition ofcentral sensory neurons. 13 Phenylbutazone Phenylbutazone is considered by clinicians to be the most efcacious and consistent NSAID in relievingpain in the laminitic horse. 13Phenylbutazone, which inhibits both COX-1 and -2, has been shownto be more effective than selective COX-2 inhibitors(e.g., rocoxib) in the laminitic horse. 13Phenylbu- tazone is also effective in treating other musculosk-eletal disorders. In treatment of joint pain, itsanalgesic effects are likely the result of suppressionof synovial membrane PGE 2, and an in vitro study of equine synovial explants challenged with lipo-polysaccharide showed no detrimental effects on sy-novial membrane viability and function aftertreatment with phenylbutazone. 14In human pa- tients, phenylbutazone has shown to reachhigher concentrations in inflamed versus non-inflamed joints due to differences in pH. 15Given the inflammation associated with laminitis, it is pos-sible that phenylbutazone concentration will be higher in the affected digit of the laminitic horse.While the concentration of phenylbutazone withinthe equine digit has not been evaluated, a studyof induced subcutaneous inflammation in poniesshowed that a single dose of phenylbutazone (4.4mg/kg) given intravenously (IV) or orally (PO) sig-nicantly reduced exudate concentrations of PGE 2 and PGF1and reduced skin temperature.15 A dose-effect relationship has also been shown with phenylbutazone. In a study of induced carpal osteoarthritis in horses, no analgesic effect was seenwith a single dose at 1.1 mg/kg while maximumanalgesic effect was seen at 2.2 mg/kg. Furtherincreasing the dose did not change the analgesiceffect but increased the duration of effect (8 hourswith 2 mg/kg dose; 24 hours with 8 mg/kg dose). 16 In a separate study of horses with naturally occur-ring chronic forelimb lameness, no difference wasseen in force platform analysis between 4.4 and 8.8mg/kg phenylbutazone IV given daily for 4 days. 17 Because of increasing risk of toxicity with increasing dosage,15the lowest effective dose should be used. While there is evidence for efcacy of phenylbuta- zone, and some report it as having superior analge- sic effects when compared to other NSAIDs,3several studies contradict this. For example, in a group ofhorses evaluated for pain using response to thermalthresholds, phenylbutazone was indistinguishablefrom saline controls. seen between phenylbutazone and pla-cebo treatment in a group of horses undergoingarthroscopic surgery, 18suggesting that the origin and type of pain may have an influence on efcacy ofphenylbutazone. In addition, one study suggests that combining phenylbutazone with other NSAIDs may be moreTable 1.

While not spe-cically evaluated in the laminitic horse, analgesiceffects of flunixin (1.1mg/kg IV) and phenylbutazone(4.4 mg/kg IV) were comparable in horses with nat-urally occurring navicular syndrome evaluated us-ing both objective (force platforms) and subjectivelameness methods. 20 Ketoprofen One study evaluating horses with bilateral chronic laminitis demonstrated that when administered atan equivalent dose, ketoprofen was more effectivethan phenylbutazone for controlling pain in horseswith occurring chronic dose of 3.63 mg/kg (equimolar to 4.4 dose) was more than the 2.2mg/kg ketoprofen or the 4.4 mg/kg phenylbutazonedoses at reducing lameness hoof pain. 21 Firocoxib has not been specically evaluated in the laminitic horse; however, rocoxib has been effectiveTable 2.

In horses with naturally occur-ring osteoarthritis, rocoxib at 0.1 mg/kg PO q24hwas as effective phenylbutazone at 4.4 mg/kg POq24h in improving lameness. 22Firocoxib was also shown to improve signs of lameness in 80% of agroup of 390 horses with naturally occurring osteo-arthritis. 23Therefore, rocoxib administration can be considered in the laminitic horse, particularly ifgastrointestinal or renal side effects are of concern. Diclofenac The topical anti-inflammatory, diclofenac, has been shown to be effective for certain conditions. Inhorses with experimentally-induced carpal osteoar-thritis, signicant improvements in lameness andhistologic cartilage scores were seen with topicaldiclofenac (7.3 g applied twice daily) versus con-trols. 24Diclofenac also has the ability to readily cross into joints and subcutaneous tissues. In onestudy, topical treatment over the joint resulted inhigher concentrations in synovial fluid than theminimal anti-inflammatory levels needed controllocal inflammation. 25In a of subcuta- neous inflammation induced with carrageenan, top-ical administration of a single dose of diclofenacsignicantly reduced local PGE 2levels.26Based on these limited studies, it may be reasonable to applydiclofenac to the coronary band of a horse with lami-nitis when inflammation is suspected as a compo-nent of the clinical picture. In addition, due tolimited systemic absorption, 24topical diclofenac may be an option for horses in whom systemicNSAIDs are contraindicated or in horses that needadditional local anti-inflammatories. an- tagonist has also been used in the horse.3,28Trama- dol is a weak opioid receptor agonist a neuronal reuptakeinhibitor. 11Since work in horses with laminitis is limited for this class of drugs, the following informa-tion is largely based on studies of their use in unre-lated orthopedic and gastrointestinal conditions.It is worthwhile noting that moderate to high doses ofopioids when given alone in the horse can have signif-icant gastrointestinal, hemodynamic, and behavioralside effects. 1It is also worth mentioning that drugs in this class are scheduled (II-IV) by the drug enforce-ment agency and have potential for human abuse. Morphine While morphine can have negative side effects if given IV, other routes of administration have proveneffective. Morphine given at 0.1 mg/kg intramus-cularly (IM) to horses hospitalized for a variety ofconditions was shown to be at detectable levels inthe plasma for 3 hours after administration withminimal side effects; however, heart rate and respi-ratory rate were the only clinical parameters as-sessed 29; the level of analgesia this dose provides is unknown. In an equine study using a lipopolysac-charide-induced synovitis model, syno-vial protein, serum amyloid A) as compared toIV administration. 30Measurable concentrations of morphine (0.1 mg/kg) were reported in the middlecarpal joint between 20 minutes and for 5 hoursafter administration intravenous regional and 32Therefore, ad- ministration of morphine in the mayprovide pain relief and has anecdotally been usedperineurally. Butorphanol In a study of 203 horses undergoing surgery (the majority were elective orthopedic surgeries), intra- operatively in addition to the NSAID. Signicantlyfewer horses that received butorphanol during sur-gery required additional analgesics postoperativelycompared to those that received NSAIDs alone. 33 The duration of analgesia in response to super- cial and visceral stimulation after IM administra-tion has been reported to be 15 to 90 minutes with0.4 mg/kg dosage providing the most intense andlongest-lasting analgesia. 34However, other stud- ies have shown that the systemic availability afterIM injection is low (37%) with a dosage of 0.08 mg/kgIM q3h necessary to maintain plasma concentra-tions. 35In addition, horses assessed for pain fol- lowing castration showed no difference betweenbutorphanol (0.05 mg/kg IM prior to surgery thenq4h for 24 hours) and phenylbutazone (4.4 mg/kg IVprior to surgery then 2.2 mg/kg PO q12h for 3 days).Combining the drugs was not superior to each drugadministered alone. 36 In a different study evaluating administration of butorphanol constant rate infusion (CRI), delayedgastrointestinal transit time was seen without sub-stantially affecting somatic nociception; 4/8 horsesshowed signs of colic in the CRI. 37 Fentanyl Transdermal fentanyl (patch) may also be a viable option for managing pain in the laminitic horse.In a study of healthy research horses with 2 /H1100310-mg fentanyl patches applied to either the antebrachium 246 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSSPORTS MEDICINE AND REHABILITATIONor gaskin, mean serum fentanyl concentrations were consistent with those reported to be analgesic inother species (1 ng/mL) by 1 hour of application.This level was maintained until 32 hours after patchapplication with no hematologic or clinical sideeffects. 38 Another study looked at fentanyl patches admin- istered to client-owned horses suffering from a vari-ety of soft tissue or orthopedic conditions (includinglaminitis). All horses were thought to be refractoryto NSAIDs (phenylbutazone or flunixin). Serumfentanyl concentrations of 1 mg/mL were measured14 hours after patch application on the antebra-chium and stayed at this level for 18 hours post-application. However, while pain scores wereimproved in the horses, lameness scores were notsignicantly improved. 39In another report of sub- jective pain assessment in a group of hospitalizedhorses, only slight improvement in horses with lami-nitic pain was noted as opposed to signicant im-provement in horses with visceral pain. 40 It is worth noting that when given intravenously, fentanyl has been shown to provide ineffective anal- gesia with undesirable behavioral effects in adulthorses. 41,42A study of conscious, standing horses tested visceral and somatic pain using duodenal/colorectal distention and thermal thresholds, re-spectively. Fentanyl was administered as a CRI atfour doses (8, 16, 32, 64 ng/kg/min). Control horsesreceived either xylazine (positive control) or saline(negative control). None of the fentanyl groupsshowed a signicant increase in visceral xylazine a signicant increase.A trend toward increased somatic threshold wasseen 15 minutes after fentanyl CRI was initiated,but only in the highest fentanyl group. 42Based on these data, it appears that there is more benet totreating pain in the laminitic horse with transder-mal as opposed to IV administration. Methadone Methadone administration has not been evaluated in the laminitic horse. As with other opioids, thedosage of methadone must be chosen carefully\u2014sideeffects including spontaneous (0.2 mg/kg), ataxia (0.5 mg/kg), and muscle tremors (0.5mg/kg) have been seen. 43,44In a study of healthy horses, methadone administered at 0.2 mg/kg IValone showed no signicant analgesic effects, as de-termined by thermal and electrical nociceptivethresholds. However, when combined with detomi-dine (0.1 mg/kg IV), a synergistic effect was seenwith signicant increases in thermal and electricalnociceptive thresholds. This improvement in anal-gesia was also greater with both methadone anddetomidine than with detomidine alone. 43There- fore, administration of methadone could be consid-ered in combination with detomidine for treatmentof acute pain.Tramadol Tramadol has been shown to have poor oral bioavail- ability and rapid elimination in horses. 45It has, however, been shown to dose-dependently improvepain in horses with chronic laminitis. Analgesiawas reported at a dose of 10 mg/kg (not seen at 5mg/kg) q12h. 11However, signs of colic have been reported in horses at the 10 mg/kg dosage.46,47 Interestingly, when tramadol was administered inconjunction with a ketamine CRI, oral tramadol wasmore effective at a lower dose in a laminitis model.Dose administration included ketamine at 0.6 mg/kg/hr for 6 for 3 days and oral tramadol at5 mg/kg q12h for 7 days. Signicant improvementin /H9251-2 /H9251-2 affer-ent activity and activating descending inhibitoryneurons. 11/H9251-2 receptors are found on primary af- ferent terminals in peripheral and spinal nerve end-ings, the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, centrally inthe brainstem, and peripherally in the joint\u2014theiractivation can produce central anal-gesia. agonists also have a synergistic ef- that may impact duration of their use. 55Al- ternate routes (e.g., epidural, intra-articular) aretherefore Detomidine Antinociceptive effects of /H9251-2 agonists in the horse have been well demonstrated,56,57but controlled studies in the laminitic horse are lacking. For other forms of musculoskeletal pain, detomidine hasbeen shown to be an effective analgesic. In onestudy of induced hoof lameness, detomidine given at10, 20, /H9262g/kg IV effectively raised the mechan- ical hoof pain threshold and lowered the intensity ofhoof withdrawal response. This analgesic effectlasted for 55 minutes (mechanical hoof pain thresh-old) and 120 minutes (hoof withdrawal response).Lameness, as assessed by the modied Obel signicantly reduced at 20- and 40- /H9262g/kg doses.58In a study of horses with naturally occur- hindlimb lameness, to the coronary band up to30 minutes after administration. Small, but signif-icant improvements in lameness, as measured by aninertial sensor system, were also seen. 59 AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 247SPORTS MEDICINE AND REHABILITATIONXylazine Local administration of xylazine may be an option for managing pain in horses. In people, intra-articular administration of /H9251-2 agonists has been shown to mediate analgesia.49Similarly, an equine study by Scicluna60showed that xylazine offers analgesic benets for horses when adminis-tered intra-articularly. However, an in vitro study evaluating xylazine administration various con-centrations /H9251-2 agonists with local anesthetics has also been shown to increase analge-sia compared to anesthetics alone. 62Therefore, perineural administration in the laminitic horsecould be considered; however, intra-articular use inthe horse should be performed with caution. Local Anesthetics Mechanism of action: Local anesthetics inhibit pain by blocking sodium channels, thereby interruptingneurotransmission near the site of injury. 11Local anesthetics prevent initiation and conduction ofelectrical impulses in C and A-delta sensory nervebers. 63They have also been shown to reduce post- synaptic depolarization mediated by NMDA recep-tors at the spinal cord in laboratory animals. 64,65 This drug class has a long history of diagnostic andtherapeutic use in the horse. Lidocaine The antinociceptive effects of systemic lidocaine have been evaluated in horses. In a study of con-scious, healthy research horses, CRI of lidocaine (2mg/kg bolus followed by 50 /H9262g/kg/min CRI for 2 increased somatic pain (thermalthreshold) and visceral pain thresholds. 66Clinical have also shown effective analgesia with theuse of lidocaine CRI in horses with chronic lamini-tis. 67While not studied in the horse, IV lidocaine has also been established as having analgesic effectsin human patients with neuropathic pain. 67 In addition to blocking neurotransmission or af- ferent signals, perineural administration of local an-esthetics have also been reported to cause a decreasein gene expression of inflammatory proteins. 68 A suppression of inflammation with perineural an-esthesia has been suggested in humans and in lab-oratory animals, 69but has not been demonstrated in the horse. There is some controversy as to whetherlidocaine has any anti-inflammatory effects in thehorse. 9 Transdermal administration of local anesthetics are thought to have some local benet over the siteof injury, 70and it has been suggested that lidocaine patches could be applied over the digital nervesof laminitic horses for pain relief. 11A study of healthy, adult horses showed an increase in boththermal and supercial mechanical nociceptivethresholds after application of a 5% lidocaine patchto the withers and saddle region. Analgesic effectswere seen after product application and at 1 hourafter the patch was removed. 70Percutaneous cath- eter placement over the palmar nerves has also beendescribed in the horse to provide continuous nerveblockade. This allows treatment with lidocaine,mepivacaine, or bupivacaine. 71 Liposomal Bupivacaine Liposomal bupivacaine was developed and ap- proved for use in humans to help prolong theanalgesic effects of the local anesthetic bupiva-caine. 72,73This formulation allows the slow re - lease of bupivacaine over time and is approved forinltrative use in the dog and cat following specicprocedures. It is estimated to provide up to 72hours of pain relief. 74 To date, two equine studies have been performed. The rst evaluated use of liposomal bupivacaine in thejoint of healthy horses to assess possible chondrotoxiceffects. Minimal effect on markers of chondrode-struction were found, suggesting that this medicationcan be administered in the joint safely. 75The second study looked at use of liposomal bupivacaine comparedto bupivacaine administered perineurally(abaxial nerve block). Forelimb lameness was in-duced by inserting a screw into the sole. Objectivelameness (inertial sensor system) and mechanical no-ciceptive thresholds signicantly nociceptive thresholds administration. The for liposomal bupivacaine post-injection). 76This formulation of bupivacaine would be benecial to provide laminitic patient with lon-ger-lasting analgesia; however, a liposomal bupiva-caine formulation is not currently labeled for use in thehorse. Ketamine Mechanism of action: Ketamine is an NMDA antag- onist and is used to help mitigate central sensitiza-tion that can occur with chronic pain. 11Ketamine has been shown to have a short duration of action;therefore, administration via CRI is stronglysuggested. 77 As mentioned previously, ketamine in combina- tion with occurring report of ketamine resultedin signicantly reduced limb off-loading frequencyfor the entire treatment of 7 days. Signi-cant reductions in TNF- /H9251and TXB2 (a stable me- tabolite TXA2)were also seen in the ketamine-tramadol group,which was not seen with oral tramadol alone. 48 However, CRI of ketamine alone may not be ben- ecial. One study looked at ketamine given tohorses treated for a variety of conditions, includingosteomyelitis, joint sepsis, burns, and colic. 13Ket- 248 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSSPORTS MEDICINE AND REHABILITATIONamine CRI was given at 400 and 800 /H9262g/kg/hr for 5 days. Horses showed variable response with some horses showing no signs of comfort while othersshowed markedly increased comfort. However,pain was evaluated using only heart rate and asubjective comfort evaluation. 13 Gabapentin Mechanism of action: Gabapentin is used predomi- nantly for human and veterinary patients with chronic and neuropathic pain.78Gabapentin me- diates analgesia by binding to the /H9251-2-/H9254-1 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in the spinalcord and brain. It can then change the release ofthe neurotransmitters glutamate, GABA, andnorepinephrine. 79 Multiple case reports are available detailing suc- cess with use of gabapentin in chronic 83Therefore, high oral doses (5 to 20 mg/kg PO 2 to 3 times daily) are recommended.3 A recent study suggests even higher doses could beused in the horse. A single dose of gabapentin wasadministered to a group of 9 healthy horses at 10,20, 40, 60, 80, 120, and 160 mg/kg in a randomizedcross-over design. Plasma samples were taken upto 64 hours after administration. Horses were alsoevaluated for signs of sedation and ataxia. Whileplasma concentrations increased across the doselevel, the increase was not in a proportionalmanner\u2014the authors concluded that a dose higherthan 120 mg/kg would not provide any noticeabledifferences in pharmacological effect. Only onehorse showed signs of moderate sedation at thehigher dosages (120 mg/kg and 160 mg/kg). How-ever, evaluation of hepatic and renal values was notperformed and the authors comment that the safetyof repeated dose administration higher than 20mg/kg needs to be evaluated further. 84 Gabapentin has been reported to be ineffective at reducing the degree of chronic lameness in thehorse. In one study, horses with naturally occur-ring osteoarthritis in a variety of joints were givengabapentin orally at 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg q8h for14 days. No signicant improvement in lamenesswas seen for either group. 80In another report, no improvement was seen when gabapentin (20 mg/kgq12h PO) was added to treatment with phenylbuta-zone (4 mg/kg q12h PO) in a horse with severe lami-nitis. Authors also showed that the plasmaconcentrations were well below that reported to pro-vide analgesia in humans and treatment durationwas limited to 2 days. 81It is likely that both an increased dose and duration of treatment are neededif gabapentin is to have efcacy in treating action: Epidurals allow administra- tion of analgesics at lower doses than those required for systemic administration. Morphine given alone (0.2 mg/kg) and when com- bined with up to 6 hours after administra-tion. 85In addition, horses that received this same drug combination via epidural before stifle arthros-copy had signicantly reduced lameness and heartrates compared to controls. 86Hence it is possible that epidural morphine (alone or in combinationwith detomidine) might have for hind-limblaminitis. Efcacy of for horses withforelimb disease including laminitis remains a topicof debate. However, several studies suggest thatthere may be a benet. For example, in a study ofcarpal synovitis induced with lipopolysaccharide inponies, either a or istered. A signicant reduction in lameness wasseen at 30 minutes with the morphine group and at6 hours with the buprenorphine group, suggestingthat morphine epidural was an effective analgesicfor pain in the thoracic limbs. 87 Vasodilators Mechanism of action: Chronic laminitis is marked by aberrant vascular patterns and hemodynamicdisturbances of lamellar tissues. 88,89Endothelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictor has been shown to havesignicantly increased expression in connective tis-sues during chronic laminitis as opposed to acutelaminitis. 90While vasodilators have been used in the laminitic horse in an attempt to offset this dis-ruption, it is unknown if changes in blood flow con-sistently occur and help with healing or alleviatepain. Pentoxifylline Pentoxifylline is a rheologic agent 4that is thought to increase blood flow in compromised vasculature by increasing the malleability of blood cells.91Vasodi- latory effects are mediated through pro-duction of intracellular cyclic adenomonophosphateand nitric oxide. 92,93Pentoxifylline has been shown to have extremely variable absorption in thehorse after oral administration. 94,95Bioavailabil- ity is also somewhat variable. In one study,healthy horses received 10 mg/kg pentoxifylline POq12h for 8 days\u2014bioavailability after the rst dosewas 68% and decreased to 44% after the last dose.Pentoxifylline has been shown to produce endothe-lium-dependent and endothelium-independent re-laxation of the equine digital veins. Pentoxifyllinealso mediates improvements in systemic microvas-cular flow and tissue oxygen delivery. 92Relaxation of the equine digital veins was shown in vitro92; however, use of pentoxifylline (4.4 mg/kg PO q8h PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 249SPORTS MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION10 days) was not found to increase blood flow in the digit of normal horses in an in vivo study.91Use of pentoxifylline has not been evaluated in laminitichorses. Isoxsuprine Isoxsuprine is a peripheral vasodilating agent that has been described as a beta receptor agonist and analpha adrenergic receptor antagonist. 91,96Isoxsu- prine is also thought to decrease blood viscosity byincreasing blood flow or by increasing flexibility ofred blood cells. 91In a study of horses with navicu- lar syndrome, improvements in clinical assessments(lameness evaluation, hoof testers, flexion tests)were seen after oral administration (0.6 mg/kg, 1.2mg/kg, or 1.8 mg/kg q12h for 21 days) 97with no differences between dosages.98 However, in a study evaluating isoxsuprine ad- ministration to a group of healthy horses (1.2 mg/kgq12h orally for 10 days), no signicant increase inblood flow to the digit or dorsal laminae was seen. 91 Evaluation of use in the laminitic horse has not beenperformed. Additionally, reports indicate that thevasodilatory effects of isoxsuprine occur only atdoses that induce neurologic side effects in thehorse. 9,91A somewhat novel suggestion is that isoxsuprine may have some local anesthetic proper-ties, but again analgesia following administrationhas not been evaluated in the horse. 97 Acepromazine Acepromazine is a phenothiazine tranquilizer with no direct analgesic effects. Acepromazine has beensuggested for use in laminitic horses for its periph-eral vasodilatory effects and potential to restore dig-ital blood flow. 91Acepromazine has been reported to increase arterial diameter and blood flow in thedorsal metatarsal artery in horses. 99In addition, IV administration at 0.06 mg/kg has been shown toincrease digital arterial and laminar blood flow inmultiple studies using normal horses. 100,101While these studies have shown an increase in digitalblood flow in the normal horse, it is unknown ifincreased blood flow occurs in the laminitic horse.This dose is also on the higher side of what is com-monly used for tranquilization so other side effects(e.g., tranquilization, hypotension) occur. Biologics Mechanism of action: Biologic therapies including platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and stem cells have beenevaluated for use in the laminitic horse. These bi-ologic therapies are thought to help alleviate painmainly through their anti-inflammatory activity.Biologics may be particularly useful for cases ofchronic laminitis by antagonizing the self-perpetu-ating catabolic and proinflammatory mechanismsthat lead to local ischemia and neuropathic pain. 88 In addition to anti-inflammatory effects, stem cellsalso have immunomodulatory and anti-oxidative ef-fects that may be protective against hypoxia/reper-fusion injury. 102-104 A study evaluated return to use in a group of nine horses with chronic laminitis treated with stemcells. Horses received IVRP with adipose-derivedstem cells suspended in PRP. Horses received be-tween 3 and 6 treatments at 1-month intervals.All horses were back in use 6 months after treat-ment. One year after treatment, 7/9 horses werestill in work. 105 An additional study looked at treating a group of 15 horses with mesenchymal stem cells via IVRP orintra-arterial stem cells. Intra-arterial stem cellswere shown to have a better distribution within thefoot than IVRP; however, no signicant difference insuccess by treatment route was appreciated. Therewas a signicant relationship between timing oftreatment and success following treatment withstem cells. For horses treated sooner than 71.5days after onset of laminitis, 87% were successful.For horses treated after 71.5 days, only 53% weresuccessful. Treatment was also more successful inyounger horses (82% for horses /H1102111 years of age) versus older horses (50% for horses /H1102211 years of age); however, there was no signicant differencebetween age groups. While this study shows prom-ise, \"success\" of treatment was never dened. 106 There are also reports of several horses with chroniclaminitis treated with PRP injected into the coro-nary band. These horses showed decreased lame-ness and improved comfort level; however, nocontrolled studies have been performed. 88 Potential Treatment Options Cytochrome P450 Epoxygenases Mechanism P450 another which includestransformation into epoxides. 81Epoxides have multiple biological activities, including modulationof inflammation and nociceptive signaling. 107The biological activity of epoxides is limited by the en-zyme soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH inhibitor). 81 An equine study evaluated the use of an sEH inhibitor in 10 horses with naturally occurring acuteand chronic laminitis affecting 2 to 4 feet. Eight ofthe 10 horses showed signicant improvements incomfort level, as evaluated by visual analog scaleand reduced number of forelimb lifts observed (limbshifting). Histopathology of the laminae was per-formed on three horses who were not treated withthe sEH inhibitor. Evaluation showed increasedlevels of sEH activity in the laminae of laminitichorses compared to nonlaminitic controls. 108 An additional equine study by the same author looked at use of an sEH inhibitor in an inducedmodel of synovitis. Horses were treated with the 250 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSSPORTS in joint with lipopolysaccha-ride. A dose of 1 mg/kg of the sEH inhibitorproduced signicant antinociceptive effects, asevaluated by visual analog scale and subjectivelameness scores. No signicant anti-inflammatoryactivity was present as evaluated by cell numbers,joint effusion, and protein concentration. 109 Similar ndings were seen in laboratory rodent models. An sEH inhibitor showed signicantly im-proved pain in a model of inflammatory and neuro-pathic pain in rodents. 110,111In addition, stronger anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects have beenseen in rodents when compared to coxibs orNSAIDs. 111,112Unfortunately, to the author's knowledge there currently is no product that is com-mercially available. In the equine studies, the drugwas synthesized by one of the authors. 108,109 Resveratrol Mechanism of action: Resveratrol is found in the skins of certain red grapes, peanuts, blueberries, and the roots/stalks of Japanese knotwood.113Re- The antioxidative effects are thought to be due toactivity as a free radical scavenger. 115 Resveratrol has been shown to be as effective as COX inhibitors in decreasing production of IFN- /H9253 and TNF- /H9251by peripheral blood equine study, resveratrol administration to agroup of 20 older horses for 4 weeks was shown tosignicantly decrease serum inflammatory cytokineproduction. 116 Another study evaluated horses fed 2000 mg res- veratrol daily for 28 days. These horses had signif-icantly superoxide dismutase activity(provides vascular supplementation.However, the resveratrol product given also con-tained 200 mg sodium hyaluronic acid, so it is un-known which compound was of most benet. 116 An additional equine study evaluated supplementa-tion to horses with hindlimb lameness localized tothe distal hock joints. Client-owned horses had thedistal hock joints treated with corticosteroids andthen received 1000 mg resveratrol twice daily or aplacebo supplement for 4 months. Horses that re-ceived resveratrol showed signicant improvementsin performance compared to the placebo group ac-cording to client questionnaire. The resveratrolgroup on objective lameness evaluations demon-strated signicant improvements in the amplitudeof pelvic displacement. However, there was no dif-ference in subjective lameness scores or objectivemaximum/minimum pelvic height difference usinginertial sensor assessment. 117 Acetaminophen Mechanism of action: While the mechanism for pain modulation is not completely un derstood, acet-aminophen is thought to inhibit COX-3, which is involved in central pain perception.3Other re - ports have suggested that acetaminophen acts onserotonergic and cannabinoid pain pathways inthe central nervous phen also has activity as a vasodilator.100,118 Acetaminophen was reported as an effective ad- junctive treatment in a pony with laminitis119and has excellent oral bioavailability.3,77A recent study was performed evaluating the oral adminis-tration of acetaminophen in healthy, adult horses ata dose of 20 mg/kg for 14 days. Gastroscopy wasperformed at the start of the study and at the end ofthe 14-day course; no signicant changes in gastros-copy scores were seen. Liver biopsies were alsoperformed, which showed mild evidence of portalinflammation in all horses; however, horses showedno signs of hepatic dysfunction. A mild increase intotal bilirubin was also found on serum chemicalanalysis. 120 of action: Amitriptyline is a tricyclic an- tidepressant and is thought to have analgesic effects by its action on /H9251-2 adrenoreceptors and its ability to block sodium channels.77,121Amitriptyline also has anticholinergic and antihistamine properties122 and has also been shown to be a serotonin reuptakeinhibitor, which then enhances the action of sero-tonin at the spinal terminals of the opioid-mediatedintrinsic analgesic system. 49 In a rat study, addition of amitriptyline signi- cantly improved analgesia as measured by the tail-flick test when compared to administration ofmorphine alone. 123While there are reports of use in the horse,3,77to date no controlled studies have been performed. Grapiprant Mechanism of action: Grapiprant is a prostaglandin receptor antagonist with specic and potent activity against the PGE2EP4 receptor with anti-inflamma- tory and analgesic effects.124 Multiple canine studies have shown effective pain relief in dogs with osteoarthritis124with no signi- cant side effects with long-term use.125A study in 12 healthy, adult horses evaluated the safety andpharmacokinetics following a single dose of grap-iprant at 2 mg/kg by mouth. No adverse effectswere noted. Grapriprant was able to be measuredwithin the serum for 72 hours post-administra-tion. 126To date, no studies evaluating the analge- sic effects in the horse have been performed. 3. Non-Pharmaceutical Treatment Options Digital Hypothermia Mechanism of action: Digital hypothermia (icing) of the distal limb of the horse can decrease pain by decreasing inflammation within the foot.9In addi- tion, digital hypothermia may /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 251SPORTS MEDICINE AND REHABILITATIONfect on the tissues due to a reduction in energy metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, and free-radical production. 127The recommended hoof wall therapeutic surface temperature is 5\u00b0 to 10\u00b0C sus-tained for 48 to 72 hours. 128A comparative study evaluating various methods of icing the digit showedthat ice and water immersion methods that includedboth the foot and the distal limb were effective atreaching this temperature. Commercially avail-able dry icing units did not reach the targeted tissuetemperature. 128 In multiple experimental studies of induced lami- nitis, digital hypothermia performed just below the carpus for 72 hours at the induction of laminitis sig-nicantly reduced lamellar injury 129-131compared to controls. Horses also showed signicantly improvedclinical signs of laminitic pain for 7 days following 72hours of continuous digital hypothermia. 132 There is conflicting information about the efcacy of initiating digital hypothermia after lamenessassociated with laminitis is present. One studydemonstrated that a protective effect was still pres-ent with signicantly reduced lamellar injury ob-served. 130However, another study showed no reduction in the lamellar concentration of moleculesassociated with inflammatory signaling whendigital hypothermia was initiated after signs oflaminitis versus initiation at the time of laminitisinduction. 68 While no studies have shown a detrimental effect of digital hypothermia in the laminitic horse, thereis thought that therapy must be performed continu-ously rather than intermittently. Otherwise, vaso-dilation and rebound hyperemia could occur oncethe feet are removed from the ice water. 2 Acupuncture Mechanism of action: Acupuncture can m ediate an- algesia by modulating nociceptive input at the level ofthe dorsal horn of the spinal cord 133and by endogenous opioid release after stimulation of receptor sites in thedorsal horn of the spinal cord. 134Acupuncture stim - ulates descending inhibitory toendogenous opioids. Electroacupuncture uses stimu-lation of the acupuncture needles with a mild electricalcurrent, and may provide more analgesia than dry-needle acupuncture. 135 Several laboratory animal studies have shown positive effects of electroacupuncture. In one ro-dent study, rats with induced osteoarthritis receivedeither no treatment, treatment with electroacupunc-ture, or electroacupuncture with antago-nist, electro-acupuncture was performed. Signicantly moreweight bearing was noted in the electroacupuncturegroup versus the control and antagonist groups,demonstrating that the mechanism of action of elec-troacupuncture is similar to stimulation of opioid,serotonin, and dopamine receptors. 135Other ro-dent studies showed that electroacupuncture iseffective at modulating chronic inflammatorypain. 136,137 Benet has also been shown in horses. In one equine study, dry-needle acupuncture and electroa-cupuncture signicantly increased the cutaneouspain thresholds in the lumbar thermaland electrical stimulation. In addition, /H9252-endor- phin cerebrospinal fluid concentrations were signif-icantly increased at 30 and 120 minutes followingelectroacupuncture. 134An additional equine study showed alleviation of pain in 6/7 horses with chroniclaminitis following acupuncture treatment. In ad-dition, these horses had a reduced need for analgesicmedications; however, only subjective evaluation ofpain was used for assessment and the duration ofthe analgesic effect was not described. 98 Manual Therapies Mechanism of action: Horses with chronic laminitis can experience signicant comorbidities throughoutthe axial skeleton as they compensate for painoriginating from their feet. Manual therapies, in-cluding spinal manipulation, massage, and physio-therapy can be of benet to help treat this secondarypain. Manual therapies can induce relaxation andare thought to increase pain thresholds by stimulat-ing release of endorphins and serotonin. Spinalmanipulation alleviates pain by means of gate-control theory by inducing stretch of spinal mecha-noreceptors that then decrease central sensitization.Massage is thought to modulate local blood flow andoxygenation of tissues. 138 No studies have been performed in the laminitic horse; however, massage and soft-tissue mobiliza-tion are thought to increase blood flow, decrease mus- cle hypertonicity, and speed return to normal function;however, few controlled studies have been per-formed. 138A study of horses with back pain showed that following massage, mechanical nociceptivethresholds were increased in the thoracolumbar re-gion. 139Other studies have also demonstrated an in- mechanical nociceptive thresholds followingchiropractic treatments. 139-141An additional equine study showed that passive stretching helps signi-cantly increase stride length, increase joint range ofmotion, and improves overall comfort. 138 Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation Mechanism of action: transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) uses electrical current ap-plied via surface electrodes to preferentially stimu-late peripheral nerves and is used primarily for painmodulation. 142,143Similar to acupuncture, there are two proposed mechanisms for the antinocicep-tive effects of TENS: 1) Gate control theory: re-duction of pain input at the dorsal horn of the spinalcord secondary to stimulation of peripheral mecha-noreceptors, and 2) opiate-mediated pain control:TENS stimulates release of endorphins and theirprecursors into the cerebrospinal fluid. 134 252 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSSPORTS MEDICINE AND REHABILITATIONTo date, there are no studies evaluating use of TENS in horses. However, human studies sug- gest that TENS may be a viable option for paincontrol. TENS has been shown to alleviate proce-dural pain in humans during dental procedures (mi-nor tooth extractions, cavity preparations, intraoralinjections) and to reduce post-operative pain, anal-gesic consumption, nausea/vomiting, and speed ofrecovery. 143TENS was shown to be effective for reducing acute post-operative pain in people if elec-trodes were placed close to the incision and a strong,denite, subnoxious (maximal tolerable) sensationwas achieved. 142TENS is commonly recommended for use in humans with chronic pain in addition tomedication. Benets have been reported in 60% ofpatients during the rst few months of use. How-ever, this effect is noted to diminish over time. 142 Not all human studies show support for use of TENS. In a randomized human study evaluatinguse of TENS for chronic lower-back pain, there wasno signicant improvement in pain even when pa-tients were educated on how to correctly use theTENS unit. 144In addition, variable efcacy is present when evaluating pain modulation for peoplewith rotator cuff tears, sciatica, and bromyalgia. 142 Therapeutic Shoeing/Trimming Therapeutic shoeing and trimming can provide tre-mendous pain relief in the laminitic horse and is acritical component for long-term management ofthese cases. Because this topic has been coveredextensively elsewhere by experts in the eld, 4,106,145 it will not be covered in this review. 4. Case Examples The case examples below show a potential multi-modal approach to treating acute and chronic lami-nitis. Many treatment options are available, basedon clinician experience and preference. Acute Laminitis Treatment in the Field A 14-year-old Quarter Horse gelding unlocks the door to the feed room and consumes half a bag ofsweet feed. Within 24 hours the gelding is acutelygrade 4/5 forelimb lame with moderately increaseddigital pulses in both front feet and the horse hasadopted the classic laminitic stance. Pain Management Strategies NSAIDs: Administration of phenylbutazoneat 4.4 mg/kg PO twice daily for 3 to 5 days,then tapered to 2.2 mg/kg PO twicedaily. The dose is further reduced to 2.2mg/kg once daily as the horse's pain level willallow. If phenylbutazone alone is not suf-cient, administration of 2.2 mg/kg phenylbuta-zone PO twice daily plus 1.1 mg/kg flunixin POtwice daily for 2 to 3 days can be considered.Digital hypothermia: Ice and water areplaced in an ice boot that includes the foot anddistal limb and secured to the horse's frontfeet. This is changed as frequently as possi-ble by the owner. At times when the digitalhypothermia is not possible, the horse is keptin cushioned boots that provide frog and solesupport. If unable to ice, the horse is placedin a cushioned boot at all times. Acupuncture: Perform both dry-needle andelectroacupuncture, choosing points aimed attargeting the front feet. Treatment is per-formed 1 to 2 times weekly. TENS: A region of hair is clipped over thecranial thoracic region, just off dorsal midline.The TENS pads are applied after wetting thearea and applying a small amount of couplinggel. The TENS unit itself is secured to themane. Chronic pain settings are used despitethe acute nature of the laminitis and the unitis applied to 30 minutes twice daily. This is tostimulate endogenous opioid release\u2014this willallow pain relief that lasts beyond the time theTENS unit is removed. Topical diclofenac: The hair above the coro-nary band is clipped. When not icing, topicaldiclofenac ointment is applied over the coro-nary band, 1 to 2 times daily. Treatment in the Hospital A 12-year-old Warmblood mare is presented to an equine referral hospital for acute colitis and endo-toxemia. While being treated for this condition, themare develops acute bilateral forelimb laminitis. Pain management strategies to target the lamin- itis are below (other treatments are also being per-formed to treat the colitis and endotoxemia): NSAIDs: Administer phenylbutazone at 4.4mg/kg IV twice daily for the rst 3 to 5days. This dose is then tapered, as dictated by the horse's comfort level. Because of the endo-toxemia present, flunixin at 1.1 mg/kg IV q12h isalso a reasonable choice. If phenylbutazonealone is not sufcient, administration of 2.2mg/kg phenylbutazone IV twice daily plus 1.1mg/kg flunixin IV twice daily for 2 to 3 days canbe considered. Digital hypothermia: Ice and water areplaced in an ice boot that includes the foot anddistal limb and secured to the horse's frontfeet. The boots are regularly relled with ice,such that icing is continuous for at least 72hours. Acupuncture: Perform both dry-needle andelectroacupuncture, choosing points aimed attargeting the front feet. Treatment is per-formed 1 to 2 times weekly. TENS: A region of hair is clipped over thecranial thoracic region, just off dorsal midline.The TENS pads are after wetting the AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 253SPORTS MEDICINE AND REHABILITATIONarea and applying a small amount of coupling gel. The TENS unit itself is secured to themane. Chronic pain settings are used despitethe acute nature of the laminitis and the unitis applied to 30 minutes twice daily. This is tostimulate endogenous opioid release\u2014this willallow pain relief that lasts beyond theTENS unit is removed. Fentanyl patch: 2 /H1100310-mg fentanyl patches are applied over the antebrachium after clip-ping the hair. They are covered with elasti-con to keep them in place. The patches arechanged every 36 to 48 hours. Perineural analgesia: 3 mL of 0.5% bupiva-caine is injected over the medial and lateralpalmar nerves at the level of the fetlock (abax-ial nerve block) every 12 to 24 hours. Morphine: 0.1 mg/kg morphine is given IMas needed, not to exceed a frequency q3hadministration. Chronic Laminitis Treatment in the Field A 25-year-old Paint gelding previously diagnosed with pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID)has a history of multiple episodes of laminitis affect-ing the front feet. While previous episodes haveimproved after a few days of phenylbutazone, thisepisode has already lasted 14 days with no signs ofimproving. The horse has been on 2 g phenylbuta-zone by mouth twice daily for the last 14 days.His appetite has decreased, and he has mildly loosestool. Radiographs show 3\u00b0 to 5\u00b0 rotation of thecofn bone in both front feet and chronic remodelingof the distal aspect of P3. On palpation, markedmuscle hypertonicity sensitivity asover the thoracolumbar epaxial musculature. Thehorse appears to be hypersensitive to light touchover the back and neck, and wind-up pain issuspected. Pain Management Strategies NSAIDs: Because of the reduced appetite and loose stool, place the horse on rocoxib, 3 /H1100357-mg tablets are given on the rst day, followed by 1 /H1100357 mg tablet once daily by mouth. Supportive, therapeutic trimming/shoeing: Rec- ommend placing the horse in a therapeutic boot thatprovides support over the frog/sole as well as cush-ioning. Then consult with the horse's farrier tohave therapeutic Gabapentin: Gabapentin is prescribed at 20 mg/kg q12h PO. This dose is slowly tapered over 3to 4 weeks once the wind-up pain has resolved.Tapering of the dose (reducing total dose by 12every week) has been advised to prevent rebound pain. Acupuncture: Perform both dry-needle and elec- troacupuncture; acupuncture points are chosen thattarget the front feet. Treatment is performed onceweekly for 3 to 4 weeks, then once every 2 to 4weeks, depending on the horse's response to treat-ment. Local points are also chosen over the neckand back to help with secondary muscle pain, astolerated by the patient. This treatment may notbe tolerated by the horse until the wind-up pain isaddressed. TENS: TENS is applied for 30 minutes 2 to 3 times per day in the same manner as for acutelaminitis. Manual therapy: Advise the owner to purchase a massager to gently massage over the back and neck,as tolerated by the patient. Gentle physiotherapyexercises, such as back wiggles, are also prescribed.It may not be possible to perform this treatmentuntil the wind-up pain is addressed. Topical diclofenac: The hair above the coronary band is clipped. Topical diclofenac ointment is ap-plied over the coronary band, twice daily. Lidocaine patches: After clipping the hair in the pastern region, 5% lidocaine patches are placed overthe palmar digital nerves and secured with elasti-con. The duration of effect of the patches is notknown, so it is elected to change the pads every 8 to12 hours. Biologics: IVRP with mesenchymal stem cells is performed at 1-month intervals for 3 to 6 treat-ments. After placing a tourniquet above the fet-lock, 20 to 30 million stem cells suspended inlactated ringer's solution are infused in the palmardigital vein. Intra-arterial administration via thepalmar digital or medial artery could also be consid-ered. No tourniquet is used if intra-arterial injec-tion is to be performed. Treatment in the Hospital A 5-year-old Thoroughbred gelding has been hospi- talized for the past 3 weeks following fracture repairof the left hindlimb (LH) proximal phalanx. Thehorse has intermittently limb and has laminitis in the righthindlimb (RH) foot. The horse also has markedsensitivity to palpation the gluteal and lumbarepaxial musculature, and central sensitization issuspected. Pain Management Strategies NSAIDs: The horse is maintained on 2.2 mg/kg phenylbutazone IV twice daily, care-fully monitoring the horse's kidney values,albumin, appetite, and stool. alone is not sufcient, of4.4 mg/kg phenylbutazone IV twice daily or 2.2mg/kg phenylbutazone IV twice daily plus 1.1mg/kg flunixin IV twice daily for 2 to 3 dayscan be considered. Supportive or therapeutic boot: A cushionedboot is applied to the RH foot. Acupuncture: Perform both dry-needle andelectroacupuncture; acupuncture points are 254 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSSPORTS MEDICINE AND REHABILITATIONchosen that target the hind feet. Treatment is performed once weekly for 3 to 4 weeks, thenonce every 2 to 4 weeks, depending on thehorse's response to treatment. Local pointsare also chosen over lumbar and gluteal regionto help with secondary muscle pain, as toler-ated by the patient. This treatment may notbe tolerated by the horse until the wind-uppain is addressed. TENS: TENS is applied for 30 minutes 2 to 3times per day in the same manner as for acutelaminitis. Manual therapy: A massager is applied overthe thoracolumbar and gluteal musculaturedaily, as tolerated by the patient. This treat-ment may not be tolerated by the horse untilthe wind-up pain is addressed. Epidural: An epidural consisting of morphineat 0.2 mg/kg and detomidine at 30 is administered via epidural every 12hours. Gabapentin: Gabapentin is prescribed at 20mg/kg q12h PO. This dose is slowly taperedover 3 to 4 weeks once the wind-up pain hasresolved. Tapering of the dose (reducing totaldose by 12every week) has been advised to prevent rebound pain. Biologics: IVRP with mesenchymal stemcells is performed at 1-month intervals for 3 to6 treatments. After placing a tourniquetabove the fetlock, 20 to 30 million stem cellssuspended in lactated ringer's solution are in-fused in the palmar digital vein. Intra-arte-rial administration via the palmar digital ormedial artery could also be considered. Notourniquet is used if intra-arterial injection isto be performed. 5. Summary Pain management of the laminitic horse can be ex-tremely challenging. Given the various types ofpain these horses experience, a multimodal ap-proach to pain management of the laminitic horse isnecessary. While evidence for pharmaceutical andnon-pharmaceutical approaches in the laminitichorse is somewhat limited, multiple treatment op-tions are available.

Materials and Methods Shear properties and vertical displacement werestudied with eight paired equine cadaver hooves ondirt (sand) and synthetic (sand with ber) surfacesat increasing normal loads (50, 100, 150, 200, and225 lb). Hooves were shod with positive, neutral,and negative traction characteristics; and unshodhooves served as a control. Shear data were usedto calculate angle of internal friction and cohesion.A repeated-measures ANOVA assessed the effects ofhorseshoe characteristics, surface material, andtheir interaction on shear properties ( P/H11021.05). 3. Results and Discussion Surface material had a greater effect than horse-shoe traction characteristics on shear properties.This may indicate that the addition of ber alone to surface material can signicantly alter theshear forces. The synthetic surface experiencedgreater forces that resist horizontal movement ev-idenced by larger values of normalized maximumshear force (P /H11021.05) and angle of internal friction (P/H11021.05). Surface-specic differences among horseshoe traction characteristics were more pro-nounced on the synthetic surface.

Introduction It has been established that many catastrophic injuries (CIs) occur in limbs with underlying or pre- existing pathology. While the detection of proteinbiomarkers for equine injuries has been explored as ameans of early injury detection in racehorses, the mea- surement of messenger RNA (mRNA) has not. Theobjective of this study was to determine whether thosehorses with a CI during racing demonstrate increasedinflammatory mRNA expression at the time of theirinjury when compared to non-injured control horses. 2. Materials and Methods Prospective study in which peripheral blood sampleswere collected into Tempus tubes either pre-race imme- diately (n /H11005100). Sample collection took place from September 2017 to January 2020 and included 5 different racing jurisdictions from acrossthe United States. RNA was isolated from Tempustubes and subjected to RT-qPCR for 20 differentgenes. Relative quantities of expression were cal-culated and analyzed for each gene using analysis ofvariance and receiver operating characteristic curveanalysis. 3. Results Twelve genes were excluded from data analysis dueto post-race, exercise-related effects. Of the IL-6, and MMP2 were signicantly different injured horses com- 260 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSSPORTS MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION Research Abstract /L50093for more information, contact the corresponding author NOTESpared to non-injured horses, and calculated sensitiv- ities/specicities for horses 72%, respectively. Addition-ally, proximal sesamoid bonefractures) and non-injured controls. The largestnumber of CIs in this study involved horses in claim-ing races (50%) and horses that were 3 to 4 years oldat the time of their injury (66%), while proximalsesamoid bone fractures (uniaxial or biaxial) werenoted to have the highest frequency in injuredhorses (38%). 4. Discussion Although ALOX5AP and IL-6 had relatively low sen- sitivities/specicities with respect to identifying in-jured horses, increased IGF1 and MMP2 expression was such that they could play a role as a predictorfor impending CI. This is further supported by sig-nicantly increased expression in certain fracturetypes as well as the important role these two bio-markers are known to play in bone development andfracture repair. While these ndings should beconrmed through a large-scale study utilizingpre-race/pre-training samples only, the data pro-vided by this study suggests that mRNA expression analysis may provide an economical, effective, andnon-invasive means by which most horses at risk forCIs can be identied.

Introduction The landscape of veterinary practice is denitely changing, with corporate buyers investing heavily\u2014and this isn't a brand-new trend. In fact, DVM 360offers up these examples from 2007: Summit Partners, a private equity and ven-ture capital rm, invested $128 million in Na-tional Veterinary Associates (NVA); at thatpoint, NVA owned the most freestanding vet-erinary hospitals in the United States: 99 ofthem in 29 states. VCA Antech, Inc. bought Healthy Pet Corp.and its 44 hospitals for $152.9 million, bring-ing their holdings to 450 /H11001clinics in the country. By 2016, approximately 10% of practices are corpo-rately owned. Some people, upon hearing these stories, have rung the death knell for single-doctor practices.DVM 360, in the 2007 article, begged to differ, point-ing out that VCA Antech\u2014after more than 20 yearsof being in business\u2014still only owned approximately450 hospitals out of the country's 31,000-pluspractices. So, is it possible to continue to maintain a prac- tice, and even compete with the corporate giants?Denitely. Although the percentage of corporatelyowned practices has increased, in 2016 there arestill 90% that are NOT owned by corporations. But what if a private practice owner wants to sell a practice? Does it make sense to consider a corpo-rate buyer? To help answer that question, here are insights into why a veterinary practice can be seen as anattractive investment by corporate buyers; the prosand cons of selling to one; maximizing the salesprice; tax and legal implications and more\u2014alongwith information about how a private practice canbuy another one when going up against a corporatebuyer. 2. Behind-the-Scenes of Corporate Decisions Reasons that investors like veterinary practicesare listed below: Veterinarians get paid at time of service, un-like human medicine, where doctors need towait for insurance reimbursement. Malpractice insurance costs are signicantlylower than in human medicine and emotionaldamage payments are still much lower. The veterinary industry has grown steadily formore than 40 years, even during 5 recessions. 262 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: NAVIGATING IMPORTANT CORPORATE AND LEGAL MATTERS NOTESLest this seems like a slam dunk for corporate buy- outs, consider this: investors need to buy approxi-mately 50 hospitals before they benet fromconsolidated infrastructure. So, even if they wereto buy one hospital a month, it would still take morethan 4 years to reach that tipping point. 3. Selling a Practice to a Corporate Buyer Some practice owners willingly sell to corporate buy-ers. Advantages of selling include the following: Being offered a good price: if a veterinariansees an excellent way to maximize prot\u2014andcorporate investors often offer top dollar\u2014thenit may make sense to sell. Speed of transaction: whereas an associatebuy-in can take several years, corporate inves-tors can close a deal much more quickly. Reducing the challenges of management:if a veterinarian just wants to practice medi-cine and dislikes business aspects, selling canmake good sense. Having necessary capital to upgrade facilitiesand equipment. Receiving the benets of collective wisdom. Other potential reasons for selling range from theincreasing numbers of baby boomers who are readyto retire without an associate ready to buy to youngveterinarians with plenty of student loan debt whodon't want to go even further in debt by buying apractice. Disadvantages to selling a practice to a corporate buyer can include the following: Impact to the clients: If clients have chosen apractice because of the one-on-one relation-ships formed with practice doctors and staff,they may not be satised with a corporatepractice environment, perhaps seeking out anew veterinarian even before giving the newcorporate buyer a chance. Impact on the staff, including other doctors:Employees are a practice's most valuable assetand, if a sale causes them to have concernsabout their future employment (perhaps as-suming that a corporate buyer will ease in itsown team or that the work culture will changetoo drastically), then key employees may de-cide to seek a job with another practice. Corporate requirements: A corporate buyerwill likely ask for continuing owner/veterinar-ian employment for a period of time after thesale, along with a large non-compete geogra-phy and non-compete agreements with prac-tice associates. 4. Managing Staff and Client Expectations and Fears If a sale to a corporate buyer is going to take place,it can make sense for current practice owners towork in tandem with the corporate buyer to shareinformation about the sale/transition as transpar-ently as possible with both the practice team andclients. When a family- or founder-run practice is being sold, it can be hard for employees and clients toseparate the people who have cared for their petcompanions from the business itself. They mayhave concerns about how the practice will now berun differently and how the care may change. Tocalm the waters, it can help to acknowledge that thiswill be a change, but that quality of care and con-cerns for employees' wellbeing will remain para-mount. If the practice team has largely agreed tostay, it can help to share that with the clients. 5. Selling Versus Leasing When selling a practice, there are two main compo-nents: selling the practice itself and selling thereal estate. Typically, the corporate buyer willwant to purchase both\u2014and may not consider thedeal under a leasing agreement. So, if a practice/real estate owner is otherwise happy with the saleparameters, the only choice may be to sell the realestate\u2014or to start all over with another buyer. If leasing the real estate is a consideration on the table, here are a few pros and cons to consider.First, here are some pros of leasing: This will create a stream of rental income. If the real estate appreciates, a higher saleprice can be secured in the future. Taxes that would be owed on the real estateportion of the sale will be deferred. Now, here are some cons: Some owners may not want the responsibili-ties of being a landlord/property manager. Real estate values can go down or stagnate. If the corporate buyer ultimately moves thepractice to another location, perhaps one theybuild, this can lead to complications whenseeking another renter or buyer. Also consider current leasing agreements of equip-ment and how that may affect the sale. In mostcases, leases must be paid off at the close of a sale,not being transferable to a new owner. How muchwill that cost and who will pay them? Plus, evenwhen leases are assignable, the corporate buyermay not want to accept the transfer and associatedobligations. So, during the negotiations with thebuyer, it's important to go through leases on equip-ment with a ne-toothed comb and discuss themuntil a resolution can be found. 6. Maximizing the Price An appraisal will be necessary as part of the nego-tiations process. To maximize the sales price, itcan make sense for a practice owner to get one assoon as it seems likely that the practice will be sold AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 263BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: NAVIGATING IMPORTANT CORPORATE AND LEGAL MATTERSwithin the next few years. Recommendations will be made on the appraisal that the practice ownerscan implement in ways to maximize the property'svalue. 7. Tax and Other Legal Implications The seller must be clear on how the sales price willbe taxed and, for optimal tax planning, the legalstructure of the practice may need to be changed\u2014something that may not happen as quickly as eitherparty may prefer. Plus, the buyer may not agreewith the legal structure preferred by the seller. The owner should obtain legal advice on any lia- bilities that should be addressed before a sale takesplace and to deal with any personal guarantees thathave been given to the practice. Are there anythird-party claims to consider? The seller shouldalso address any tax or legal issues that are uniqueto the practice or situation with the attorney. 8. Continuing Employment This is a key issue to address with a corporate buyer.The buyer may want, for continuity's sake, for theowner to stay at the practice for a pre-determinedamount of time\u2014perhaps 2 or 3 years. If so, whatsalary arrangements will be made? Continuing employment may be a sticking point for some sellers, especially ones who want to sellbecause they're ready for retirement; have healthissues; or who are not interested in becoming anemployee again, especially under operational sys-tems that may be quite different from how the prac-tice has been run. 9. Wanting to Buy? Finally, look at the other side of the equation. Howis it possible to compete against corporate competi-tion if wanting to buy a private practice? Well, chances of success are clearly higher if the sellerlikes the idea of his or her practice staying in privateownership. In that case, it can be important toshare with the seller how the practice would con-tinue providing the quality personal attention andservice that his or her clients are used to receiving. As far as nancing, it's possible that the seller will allow the practice to make payments for a pre-determined amount of time to eliminate the need forimmediate bank nancing. This is similar to a landcontract arrangement that some home buyers andsellers create. If this arrangement can be made,this will facilitate the building up of equity in thepractice, which will help when the practice ulti-mately needs nance; this equity may count as thedown payment, at least in part. Having equity in the practice may also help to convince a bank to agree to a longer-term loan whennancing does occur, which will reduce monthly pay-ments. It's possible that the Small Business Ad-ministration can provide nancing, especially with apractice in a rural area. Also consider going in with multiple associates to buy a practice together. This will facilitate theability to offer the seller a better price, reduce theamount of personal nancial investment, and other-wise spread the risk and workload.

Introduction When offered a job at a veterinary practice, it's im- portant to get as much information as possible aboutthe specics. Typically, a certain wage will be of-fered, often along with benets such as health in-surance, retirement benets, vacation time, etc.However, the offer may not mention workplace flex-ibility and other perks that can have a signicantimpact on the job\u2014and so it's crucial to negotiate allof the key elements of the offer. Many people feel uncomfortable when negotiating a work package, but gaining the ability to negotiatewill help one be more successful and work long afterbeginning a particular job. As a part of a veteri-nary practice team, negotiation with vendors andchallenging clients will be necessary\u2014and almostcertainly there will be times the employee needs tonegotiate with the employer about a raise, a revisedbenets package, and evolving workplace perks andpolicies. Negotiating fair compensation can make the em- ployee more committed to the practice, which trans-lates into better care for the practice's clients andtheir pets. As an employer, negotiating fairly withemployees helps to build loyalty that will stabilizeand strengthen the practice. 2. What Negotiations Are and Why They're Needed A negotiation is a process in which two or moreparties attempt to resolve differing needs and inter-ests through a series of communications. An em-ployer, for example, may want to offer someonehigher wages, but needs to consider the overall prof-itability of a practice. Meanwhile, an employeemay understand and support the need for a thrivingpractice, but also needs to earn a certain wage tosupport his or her family. Employers and employees negotiate because they each have what the other one needs, and they be-lieve they can obtain a better outcome through theprocess than if they simply accept what the otherparty is offering. Sometimes, negotiations occurbecause the status quo is no longer acceptable forone or both parties. Negotiations take nesse because, besides dealing with specic tangible points (wages, insurance ben-ets and workplace perks, as just 3 examples), emo-tions play a part and ongoing relationships areinvolved. The parties are choosing to try to resolvetheir different positions through discussions, ratherthan arguing, ending the relationship, having oneperson dominate the relationship, or taking the dis-pute to another party with more authority. 3. Negotiation Terminology Using the example of wages, employers and em-ployee alike have a target point, which are the wages they would like the other party to agree to. Thedifference between what an employee wants to bepaid and the employer wants to pay is the bargain- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 265BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: NAVIGATING IMPORTANT CORPORATE AND LEGAL MATTERS NOTESing range. Meanwhile, the resistance point is where a party would walk away from negotiations; if too low of a wage or raise is proposed, an employeemay begin job searching or a job candidate maydecline an offer; the employer also has a point atwhich he or she will reject a wage request and endnegotiations. When the buyer (employer) has a resistance point that's above the seller's (employee), this situationhas a positive bargaining range . The employer, in this case, is willing to pay more than the employee'sminimum requirements, so this situation has a goodchance of being satisfactorily resolved. With a neg- ative bargaining range , though, one or both of the parties must change their resistance point(s) forthere to be a possibility of resolution. In a wage-negotiation scenario, either the em- ployer will offer a starting wage or raise, or anemployee or job candidate will request a certaindollar amount; the rst person to name a dollaramount is making the opening offer. If at least one of the parties has a BATNA\u2014best alternative to negotiation agreements\u2014then he or she will proba-bly approach the discussions with more condence,having another alternative. So, if an employer of-fers someone a job, but has another excellent candi-date waiting in the wings, the employer has anotheralternative and can set a higher and/or rmer resis-tance point. Conversely, if an employee or job can-didate has a unique set of skills that are needed intoday's practices, that person probably has moreoptions in the job market\u2014perhaps even other pend-ing offers. The quality of a negotiator's alterna-tives drives his or her value by providing the powerto walk away and/or set a higher and/or rmer re-sistance point. 4. Bargaining Styles There is more than one type of bargaining style.One way to differentiate them is to divide them intodistributive bargaining and integrative bargaining. In distributive bargaining, parties' needs and de- sires are in direct conflict with one another's, witheach party wanting a bigger piece of a xed tangiblesuch as money or time, so these negotiations aretypically competitive. Parties are not concernedwith a future relationship with the other person.A slang term for this type of negotiation is \"playinghardball\" or \"one upping\" someone. Strategies of-ten include making extreme offers, such as an em-ployer offering a very low wage or a job candidateasking for an exceptionally high one. Tactics in-clude trying to persuade the other party to recon-sider his or her resistance point because of the valuebeing offered\u2014in this example, the job candidatemight say that a high salary was required because ofhis or her abilities or an employer could say thatlower wages would be compensated by a great workenvironment. With integrative bargaining, although, the goal is win-win collaborations that will provide a good op-portunity for both parties. The employer would ac-knowledge the employee's value and need for adecent wage, and negotiate accordingly, while theemployee or job candidate would recognize the valueof working at a particular practice as well as the factthat the employer has numerous other nancialcommitments to fulll. Each must recognize thatthey need one another to maximize their respectiveopportunities and negotiate from a place of trustand integrity, with a positive outlook that recognizesand validates the other party's interest in thetransaction. psychological truth: Nego- tiators are more satised with nal outcomes ifthere is a series of concessions rather than if theirrst offer is accepted, because they feel they couldhave done better. 5. Negotiation Styles To successfully negotiate, it's crucial to clearly de-ne the issues involved, and to prepare for the ne-gotiations. Each party should be clear about his orher target point, opening offer, resistance point, andBATNAs. Multiple negotiation styles exist, each on the spec- trum of assertiveness and cooperativeness. Beloware summaries of common styles: Competing (high in assertiveness, low in coop-erativeness): these negotiators are self-con-dent and assertive, focusing on results and thebottom line; they tend to impose their views onothers. Avoiding (low in assertiveness and coopera-tiveness): these negotiators are passive andavoid conflict whenever possible; they try toremove themselves from negotiations or passthe responsibility to someone else without anhonest attempt to resolve the situation. Collaborating (high in assertiveness and coop-erativeness): these negotiators use open andhonest communication, searching for creativesolutions that work well for both parties, evenif the solution is new; this negotiator oftenoffers multiple recommendations for the otherparty to consider. Accommodating (low in assertiveness, high incooperativeness): these negotiators focus ondownplaying conflicts and smoothing over dif-ferences to maintain relationships; they aremost concerned with satisfying the otherparty. Compromising (moderate in assertiveness andcooperativeness): these negotiators searchfor common ground and are willing to meet theother party in the middle; they are usuallywilling to give and take and nd moderatesatisfaction acceptable. As long as both parties are committed to the busi-ness relationship and believe there is value in com- 266 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: NAVIGATING IMPORTANT CORPORATE AND LEGAL MATTERSing to an agreement, negotiations can typically proceed. If one or both parties, though, are unrea-sonable, uninformed, or stubborn\u2014or listening toadvisors with those characteristics\u2014negotiationscan fall through. Other challenges exist when oneparty doesn't necessarily need the deal, isn't in ahurry, or knows that the other party is without otheroptions and/or in a time crunch. 6. Negotiation Fears Many people dread negotiation. Common reasonsfor this include the following: The employee's position has not yet been solid-ied: in this case, more preparation is clearlyneeded. Fear of looking stupid. Nobody likes lookingfoolish, so some people will avoid negotiationsaltogether rather than take the risk of notnegotiating well. Liking people and wanting to make them happy (butperhaps not being able to give them what theywant!)/not wanting to affect someone else in a neg-ative way: when interviewing for a promotion at apractice, and the employee really like the practicemanager, they may worry that negotiations will up-set the manager or put them in a difcult position. Fear of failure. Some people would prefer tonot negotiate at all, rather than make an un-successful attempt. Feeling uncomfortable with money. Somepeople were taught that it wasn't polite to talkabout money! Still, other people have an aversion to conflict, over-all, and so they avoid the potential by not negotiat-ing. Yet others feel vulnerable when negotiating. Women in particular are reluctant to negotiate, with only 7% doing so. 1They suffer the costs asso- ciated with not negotiating because they tend tohave lower expectations, fear being considered dif-cult, and can be penalized for negotiating. As asolution, women can consider framing their wantsinto the value that they will bring to the other party,and share how they can solve the underlying prob-lem of the other party. Areas where negotiating may not feel as intimi- dating include the following: Negotiations for resources, whether it's askingfor more equipment or for a practice to hiremore people. Negotiations about how to use resources; witha common purpose, solutions can be reverseengineered fairly easily. Negotiations where the employee hasexpertise. Negotiations with big companies where noth-ing is personal.Negotiations where the employee has evidenceto support their position, including facts, data,and logical reasoning. 7. Salary and Benets Negotiation Tips Even though the examples given so far have focusedon monetary compensation, when negotiating, don'tfocus solely on wage or salary. Also discuss bene-ts offered and workplace perks\u2014meaning the en-tire package. This can include, but is not limitedto, health care coverage, life insurance, retirementprograms, vacation time, and flextime. When jobhunting, investigate what companies are offering.Where does the interviewing company/practice fallon that spectrum? What is the minimum pay levelthat is acceptable? What is the preferred wage?What benets are important? If someone wants to work at a particular practice, but the pay rate isn't ideal, they could request asalary review in 6 months. This doesn't mean ac-cepting a salary that is clearly sub-par, nor does itmean putting more pressure on a potential employerwho is already offering a good deal. It is simplysomething to consider in relevant circumstances. What workplace perks might be desired? Would a company cell phone help? Better equipment orsoftware? If so, consider accepting somewhat lowerpay if more tools are offered to help get the job done. Although telecommuting is seldom an option for veterinary staff, outside of perhaps nancial orother purely administrative functions, a potentialemployee could negotiate coming in half an hourlater to accommodate children's school drop off orpick up. If the employee brings crucial skills to thenegotiating table, it is more likely they will receivethese concessions than an employee in an entry-level position. If relevant, ask about practice policy regarding pregnancy. How acceptable is the policy? Howimportant of a negotiating point is this? Whatabout injury in the workplace? Be educated onworkplace rights before negotiations occur, as wellas company policy. If the employee is valuable tothe practice, perhaps some additional flexibility canbe negotiated. Who should be the rst to make an offer? Some experts believe that, if the other party provides astarting dollar gure, then their hand has beenshown. But, research indicates that nal gurestend to be closer to the original number stated thanwhat the other party had originally hoped. 8. What NOT to Do Beware of \"between\"! It probably feels reasonableto ask for a certain salary range\u2014or range for araise. But if done with a current or prospectiveemployer, the employee has basically tipped theirhand as far as how low they would go. Using theword \"between\" is actually a concession! Another risky term: \"I think we're close.\" A savvy negotiator will recognize fatigue\" on the AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 267BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: NAVIGATING IMPORTANT CORPORATE AND LEGAL MATTERSemployee's end and perhaps stall in the hopes for a concession, just to complete the deal. 9. Negotiating with Brokers If buying or selling a veterinary practice, then nego-tiating skills will likely come in handy. For exam-ple, let's say an owner is selling a practice. In thelisting agreement contract, it is typical to agree on aperiod of time wherein the broker has exclusiverights to sell, perhaps 6 months or a year. If notsatised, can the owner terminate the agreement?It depends! It depends upon how well the originalcontract was negotiated with the agent. For exam-ple, negotiate a clause stating that the listing can beterminated immediately for good cause or with ashort period of prior notication if the termination iswithout cause. In exchange for that clause beingincluded, perhaps agree to reimburse expenses in-curred by the agent during the listing period and/orpay commission if the buyer is one that the agentinitially identied. 10. Negotiating Lab Contracts Contracts with labs that provide diagnostic servicesfor the practice will also need to be negotiated.Work on a pay-as-you-go arrangement, sendingwork to different labs, as needed. The flaw is thatnancial incentives may not be offered to practiceswho sign contracts. By signing a contract, lowerfees or better rate schedules can be negotiated.When paying less in lab fees, lower rates could beoffered to customers, which will probably make moreof them agree to pay for diagnostic testing in therst place. Signing a multi-year contract with a labmay also allow the owner to lease in-house labequipment as part of the deal. Know what's most important, run the gures, and negotiate! 11. For Best Results People tend to feel more condent during negotia-tions when it focuses on an area of their expertiseand/or where solid evidence exists to back up thenegotiations. Overall, success is achieved when: Determining the interests of the other party. Embracing compromise. Observing the Golden Rule, treating othersfairly and reasonably, without defensiveness. Be prepared, both in factual information andin strategy. Good luck! Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of Veteri- nary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Introduction A performance management program (PMP) strives to ensure the right people with the right competen-cies are in the right jobs at the right time. Aneffective PMP will also look to achieve the followingobjectives: Shape the culture and reinforce the core valuesof the practice\u2014Assessment of performance in-cludes behavior, specically behaviors that fallunder core values. An example of a core valuewould be honesty. Has the employee behavedin a way that demonstrates honesty? Facilitate communications between supervi-sors and subordinates\u2014Performance reviewsallow the subordinate and supervisor to dis-cuss any gaps between their individual assess-ments of performance. For example, if anemployee, Elaine, thinks she is excellent at ablood draw, but the supervisor has had 4 com-plaints about her blood draws this week, itopens the door to discuss those items in a con-structive way. Motivate and reward superior performance\u2014Creating a PMP template will help the em-ployer see across the board how staff areperforming by comparing apples to apples. Ifeveryone is reviewed based on a certain set of criteria, it will create a performance standard.If one of the criteria is teamwork, and Elaine isalways helping out her coworkers, this wouldprovide an opportunity to give positive feed-back and possible rewards. Effectively manage unsatisfactory perfor-mance\u2014As stated above, this will also identifythose employees who are performing below thehospital standard and allow managers to focuson the items those employees need to improve. Identify opportunities for personal growth anddevelopment\u2014Using the previous example ofElaine, if an employee is rated poorly in blooddraw, then an opportunity can be created forthem to take a course. Or perhaps a mentorday could be scheduled where one of the doc-tors practices blood draws with the em-ployee. This results in a better employee and benets the practice as well. Link pay to performance\u2014When setting goalsfor the employee, tie nancial rewards toachievements. Either next year's raise or endof year bonuses. Stimulate individual and collective productiv-ity\u2014If Elaine and the other teammates werenot meeting expectations, it lets the supervi- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 269BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: NAVIGATING IMPORTANT CORPORATE AND LEGAL MATTERS NOTESsors know this is an area where work is needed as a whole. The staff can be incentivized bymaking this a team goal and focusing for theyear. 2. Why PMP's Fail While PMPs have been utilized for many years, theyare not universally considered an effective manage-ment tool. In some cases, performance manage-ment is more about checking a box than aboutaligning employee performance and development.Instead of viewing the performance review as a valu-able communication and recognition tool, manypractices think of it as a necessary evil; a paperworkexercise that managers love to hate. Exacerbatingthis feeling of disdain is the fact that supervisorsoften spend a majority of their time focusing on thesmall minority of employees who do not meet expec-tations and not enough time giving appropriatepraise, recognition, and appreciation to those whodo. Even the best workers can be better, but if theyare not given the guidance they deserve, then theirfull potential will never be reached. Some of themore common shortcomings of a PMP include thefollowing: Individual goals are not tied to the strategicdirection of the practice\u2014i.e., the goal does nothelp the practice's vision. For example, a goalto create a protocol for remote working, whenthe practice does not allow a remote workenvironment. Senior management is not fully committed orinvested in the process\u2014When PMP's are notmade a priority, and not done in a timelymanner, oftentimes employees feel devaluedand not important. This can kill practiceproductivity. Performance objectives are only looked at every6 or 12 months and not on a continuing basis\u2014Evaluations should be all year long. For exam-ple, Elaine was late to work 34 times over thesummer (June to August), and called out sickevery Friday. It's now November and Elaine isdue for her performance review. The last 30days she's been on time and seemingly doingne. If only recent attendance was taken intoaccount, and not what has happened over thelast year, then there is a skewed vision ofperformance. Performance appraisals are not included aspart of a larger employee development initia-tive\u2014Supervisors want teams to grow. Whena team continues to evolve and grow, the prac-tice is more efcient and productive whichcan lead to increased revenue and clientsatisfaction. Little or nothing is done with the actual ap-praisal results\u2014Evaluations can take a lot oftime and effort on both the employee and thesupervisor. When next steps aren't taken toreward positive behavior, create goals, andgrowth opportunities for the employee, theycan feel discouraged and disengaged. Management fails to develop and administer acoaching and improvement plan for any em-ployee not meeting expectations\u2014If an em-ployee is not meeting expectations, but nothingis done, the employee will keep doing the samethings over and over leading the supervisor tolikely repeat the conversation the followingyear. There is a lack of clarity in the link betweenpay and performance. If goals, or the criteriathat an employee will be reviewed against arenot set, it often leads to a disparity betweenwhat the employee thinks their performancecan be vs what the supervisor believes perfor-mance is. 3. Developing a Performance Management Program A PMP can be a valuable resource for a supervisor tohelp employees identify and develop needed skills,knowledge, and abilities. However, if used inap-propriately, a PMP can demoralize employees, frus-trate managers, and expose a practice to potentiallegal risks. Therefore, several questions must beaddressed when developing a PMP: Who will beinvolved in the performance review process? Will thereview be horizontal, vertical, or a 360\u00b0? Howmuch time can each contributing party commit tothe PMP? Will the review focus on objective resultsand/or subjective perceptions? How often shouldthe reviews be performed? Who will oversee thePMP to ensure it is being used properly? Who willprovide training to the reviewers? What will bedone with the results of the reviews? And, mostimportantly, how will the success of the PMP bemeasured? 4. Conducting the Performance Evaluation Review Prior to meeting with an employee to conduct theperformance evaluation review, it is advisable tohave them complete a self-evaluation form. Givethe employee approximately 1 week to complete theperformance evaluation form and return it to his/hersupervisor 1 week in advance of the performanceevaluation review date. Only after the supervisorhas completed the performance evaluation form forthe employee, should the supervisor review the em-ployee's self-evaluation form and rating. Followingthis process will help ensure the supervisor per-forms an independent performance evaluation thatis not biased by the employee's perceptions of howhe/she performed. Other important points to con-sider when preparing for and conducting a perfor-mance evaluation review include the following: Be sure to deliver the performance evaluationreview at the designated time. Giving the re-view after the date can leave an employee feel-ing slighted, anxious, and devalued. It also 270 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: NAVIGATING IMPORTANT CORPORATE AND LEGAL MATTERSsends the unintended message that the perfor- mance evaluation review cannot be that impor-tant to the practice. Be mindful of overrating an employee. Rat-ing an employee higher than is warranted maybe an easier message to deliver, but it cancreate other problems. For one thing, it maygive failing employees a false sense of securityand make it difcult to administer neededdiscipline. When discussing a performance issue with anemployee, be sure verbal and written com-ments support the rating and always use spe-cic examples that clearly demonstrate thelevel of performance. Be sure to rate the entire performance evalu-ation review period. Supervisors often fallinto the trap of rating only the most recentactivities and actions. If an employee is beingevaluated annually, the performance evalua-tion review should consider everything, goodor bad, that has occurred during the pasttwelve months vis-a `-vis the employee's perfor-mance. In this case, it is helpful to reviewnotes of conversations that have taken placewith the employee throughout the year prior tomeeting with them. For example, if an em-ployee is late and has been reprimanded, anote should be placed in that employee'sle. Also, if the employee receives a compli-ment from a client, this should be included inthe le as well. Ask for feedback. There may be mitigatingfactors and circumstances that affected theemployee's performance during the review pe-riod. It is critically important to provide anemployee the opportunity to discuss and pres-ent an explanation of any factors and influ-ences that may have contributed to his/herperformance. Encouraging this two-way dia-logue ensures \"everything\" is considered whendeveloping the performance rating. 5. Developing Performance Goals Another key piece of a PMP involves developingperformance goals and expectations. Goals arewritten statements that clearly describe certain ac-tions or tasks with a measurable end result. Goalsshould be well dened, detailed declarations of spe-cic actions to be taken during the upcoming reviewperiod for which measurable outcomes are expected.Each goal should be specic enough to let the em-ployee know what is expected to be accomplished,why it is to be done, and the target date for accom-plishing it. The following acronym is often used toassist supervisors in developing goals for theiremployees: S: Specic\u2014Answers what, why, and when ac- tions or activities should be accomplished. M: Measurable\u2014Claries how to determine whether the goal has been achieved. A: Agreed Upon\u2014Both the employee/supervi- sor should agree on what is expected to successfullycomplete the goal. A: Aligned\u2014Supports the practice's mission and overall objectives. R: Realistic\u2014Ensures goals are doable but with a stretch challenge. T: Time Specic \u2014Establishes a deadline for completion. An example of a smart goal would look like this: The practice has identied a goal to improve commu-nications with administrative staff by implementingan internal departmental newsletter. Elaine willcomplete a business writing course by January 2021and will publish the rst monthly newsletter by March2021. Elaine will gather input and/or articles fromothers in the department and draft the newsletter forthe supervisor to review, and when approved, distrib-ute the newsletter to staff by the 15th of each month. 6. Summary In order to determine the effectiveness of a PMP, itmust rst and foremost support achievement of thepractice's mission and goals. It should help em-ployees understand what is expected of them andagainst what measurement criteria their perfor-mance will be assessed. If the program is utilizedproperly, a welcomed byproduct of the PMP isimproved communications between supervisors andsubordinates. As the PMP evolves, a practiceshould begin to notice a stronger link between payand performance. Rather than giving arbitrary in-creases to all employees, the PMP will provide jus-tication for differences in salary increases andrewards. Finally, documented differences in per-formance should help identify employees able to as-sume additional responsibilities as well as thoseindividuals requiring additional development and/ordiscipline.

Introduction Cannabis products in the veterinary industry have become a hot topic in the media lately and little isknown about the products on the market, includingtheir safety or efcacy. The goal of this paper is toexplore how cannabis products have gained popular-ity, and to share any scientic backing behind treatingveterinary patients with cannabis, and to provide ad-vice of the legal ramications that can result fromusing these treatments. Unfortunately, while canna-bis may have potential for treating ailments, theproducts on the market are illegal as well as poten-tially dangerous. Therefore, veterinarians should notstock, treat with, or recommend cannabis products asthis usage could result in a formal investigation by theVeterinary Board in the state in which they arelicensed. 2.

However, in a world ofever-changing trends, how do owners know what isbest for their pets and what is just the newest healthfad? Traditionally, veterinarians have been soughtout to help guide these decisions but, in this changingclimate, reliance upon Dr. Google is becoming morecommon\u2014and vet visits are becoming less so. Anincreasing number of people are searching for naturalalternatives to medications and opting for diets fortheir pets that are grain free, raw, and antibiotic free. Pet owners are also more commonly using their ownhomeopathic remedies. While these trends aremainly driven by consumerism and distrust in bigpharma, the growing desire for at-home remedies canresult in unsafe, unethical, and even illegal outcomes. 3. Veterinarian Responses to Fads Veterinarians must rely upon scientic research andlaws as guidance. Fortunately, with two of the morewell-known fads, scientic evidence is relatively cutand dry: grains are not evil and eating raw meat cancause a slew of health problems, such as contractingsalmonella. However, when it comes to homeopathicremedies for fleas and ticks, joint pain, dry skin, andeven neurologic conditions, the evidence is muchharder to come by. This is largely due to the lack ofregulations on many products that consumers are us-ing for remedies. There are no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, for example, on es-sential oils, herbs, or nutraceutical pills, meaningthere is no regulatory body conrming what is on thelabel; therefore, nothing conrming what is in thebottle. Despite the lack of FDA regulation and any asso- ciated concerns expressed by veterinarians, the de-sire to use natural derivatives is growing among petowners and, one specic derivative is getting plentyof press 272 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: NAVIGATING IMPORTANT CORPORATE AND LEGAL MATTERS NOTES4. Two Types of Cannabis Compounds Cannabis, dating back 6000 years, is the only plant genus that contains the molecular compounds calledcannabinoids. The two most notable compounds aretetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabinol (CBD). 1 While poorly divided, taxonomically speaking, canna-bis is easily divided into two broad types based on thebiochemical makeup. These two divisions are com-monly referred to as marijuana and hemp. The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) classies marijuana as a schedule 1 drug, whichfalls in the same category as heroin and cocaine.Due to its recreational use, it is the more well knownof the two cannabis plants. Marijuana containshigh amounts of THC, low amounts of CBD, the antipsychoactivecompound. Hemp, on the other hand, is grown for its seed and ber properties. Hemp has low levels of THC andhigh levels of CBD (at least when compared withmarijuana). Unlike marijuana, it is not possible toget high off the hemp plant. In fact, one would dieof smoke inhalation before reaching high enoughlevels of THC from hemp to achieve a recreationalhigh. 2This is due to the low concentration of THC and the fact that CBD is the antipsychoactive thatblocks the marijuana high. Because of that, somepeople refer to hemp as \"anti-marijuana.\" Industrial hemp usage is legal in the United States but, oddly enough, actually growing indus-trial hemp is illegal. In fact, since 1937, it has beenillegal to grow any variety of hemp in the UnitedStates. Under current law, imported hemp prod-ucts are subjected to zero-tolerance standards forTHC, even though the average amount of THC inmarijuana is 20%, while the average amount inhemp is 0.3%. Somewhat illogically, the UnitedStates government does not distinguish betweenthese two very different plants grown for completelydifferent purposes. 5. Note About State Laws In 2017, the number of states permitting industrialcultivation of hemp exceeded number of statesthat have legalized medicinal marijuana (33 versus29 to date). So far, though, few farms have beguncultivating hemp due to resistance from the DEA.This is because, while legalized in certain states,both marijuana and hemp are illegal federally. 6. Cannabis for Human Medicinal Purposes So, what is it in these plants that has led to medicinaluse? About 20 years ago, scientists discovered a sys-tem in the brain that responds to the compounds foundin cannabis, specically in marijuana. 3The system is called the endocannabinoid system and has beenshown to play a role in the cardiovascular, digestive,endocrine, immune, reproductive, and nervous sys-tems. The discovery sparked interest in nding spe-cic chemicals in marijuana that could be targeted totreat specic conditions. Since that time, research onmedical marijuana has increased signicantly but,with the schedule 1 classication, doing approved re-search is still difcult. While there are plenty of studies that show prom- ising results in treating conditions, in order to of-cially conduct research on cannabis, scientists mustrst get approval from the DEA and the FDA.While such studies have shown that cannabis canhelp manage pain and muscle spasms in multiplesclerosis, as well as improve symptoms of schizo-phrenia and Tourette's syndrome, too few of thestudies were controlled clinical trials with placebotreatments. 4 These results have been mirrored in the series of studies permitted by the DEA at the Center of Med-ical Cannabis Research, University of California-San Diego. The conclusion of these 13 studies wasbroad but simple: \"cannabis may be useful medi-cine for certain indications.\" Many researchersworried about the risk to users though, with somepatients becoming addicted (10%) and others ndingthe effects \"intolerable.\" 5 7. FDA-Approved Marijuana Drugs for Humans Despite the unanswered questions and research-re-lated challenges, there are currently three FDA-approved drugs made from marijuana in the UnitedStates. Marinol \u00aeand Cesament\u00aeare used to treat nausea in chemotherapy and AIDS patients, whileEpidiolex \u00aeis used to treat children's epilepsy. Fur- thermore, Sativex\u00aeis a drug developed in the United Kingdom that has been approved in over 24countries to treat muscles spasms from multiplesclerosis and cancer pain, and it may be approved inthe United States soon to treat pain associated withbreast cancer. 8. Cannabis-Based Products and Pets Because of the clinical evidence performed to dateand experimental evidence by marijuana users, whohave self treated successfully, it is no wonder thatpeople want to use cannabis-based products to helptheir animals. Given how difcult it is to get re-search approved for cannabis use in humans, onecan imagine the level of difculty involved in per-forming cannabis research in animals. The most commonly used cannabis products on the veterinary market for treatment of animals allcontain CBD oil. CBD can be extracted from mar-ijuana or hemp and has claims to treat numerousdisorders, including behavioral issues, seizures, andpain. While many veterinarians would welcome asafe and effective new way to treat diseases such asarthritis or epilepsy, lack of legality and solid clini-cal studies makes the situation uncertain. Veterinary medical uncertainty has not stopped an array of products from popping up on the market.At conferences, one can be bombarded by naturo-pathic vendors that appear reputable, makingclaims on their products that cannot be substanti- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 273BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: NAVIGATING IMPORTANT CORPORATE AND LEGAL MATTERSated. This makes it difcult to differentiate fact from ction and, unless veterinarians are up to dateon the current American Veterinary Medical Asso-ciation (AVMA) and federal standards, they may betricked into stocking these products at theirpractices. In a study that was performed by the Department of Clinical Sciences and College of Veterinary Med-icine and Biomedical Sciences at Colorado StateUniversity, published in the Journal of the Ameri- can Holistic Veterinary Medical Association and Sci- entic Report, 6veterinarians were assigned three objectives: nd out which cannabis products petowners purchased, their reasons for the purchase,and whether they perceived a difference in their petwhile using the product. The results of this studyincluded 632 pet owners (88.1% dog owners, 11.9%cat owners) who have purchased hemp productsfrom an online site. Most of the dog and cat owners(77.6% and 81.8%, respectively) indicated that theyuse the hemp product for an illness or conditiondiagnosed by a veterinarian. The most common conditions eliciting treatment in dogs included seizures, cancer, anxiety, and ar-thritis. The illnesses or conditions treated in catswere comparable, with cancer, anxiety, and arthritisas the most common. The most common side ef-fects reported by both dog and cat owners were se-dation and overactive appetite. When dog ownerswere asked about the perceived positive impacts ofthe hemp, they reported the highest impact in relieffrom pain (64.3%), followed by helping with sleep(50.5%), and relief from anxiety (49.3%). Cat own-ers perceived the highest impacts as relief from pain(66%), followed by reduced inflammation (56.3%)and help with sleep (44%). This information sup-ports the growing anecdotal stories of the effects ofcannabis in pets. In addition, this information pro-vides a platform for researchers seeking to performclinical studies on not only the effectiveness of hempbut also the adverse outcomes associated with theuse of hemp. Interestingly, this study also surveyed pet owners about their disclosures to their veterinarian aboutthe hemp products used. Just under half of theparticipants had spoken with their veterinarianabout the product, with most indicating that theirveterinarian responded positively (61.7%), some ex-pressing no opinion (30.7%) and very few respondingnegatively (7.7%). While most veterinarians wouldagree that anything having a positive impact on apet is, in fact, positive, in this case, it is still illegal.In a recent article by the AVMA titled, \"Cannabis:What Veterinarians Need to Know,\" 7the AVMA cautions pet owners against the use of chews, oils,and nutritional supplements containing CBD, citingthe FDA as its regulatory beacon. Currently, the FDA does not approve the use of marijuana or hemp in any form in animals becauseof the lack of evidence about the safety and effective-ness of the products. The DEA stated in 2017 that\"cannabinoids are not found in hemp, except in traceamounts. Therefore, extracts that contain morethan trace amounts of cannabinoids must be part ofthe cannabis plants that are dened as marijuanaand regulated as a schedule 1 controlled substance.\" In all this legislation, it might appear that hemp is unfairly getting a bad name; however, the AmericanSociety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals(ASPCA) poison control center has recently reportedan influx of calls and claims that ingestion of hemp-based CBD products causes the same clinical signsas ingestion of marijuana (products containingTHC). It is not known whether toxicity is due toquality control issues in unregulated products, dif-fering metabolism rates of CBD, or varying amountsof CBD in products despite label claims. The mostcommon clinical signs include ataxia, depression,mydriatic pupils, hyperesthesia, and urinary in-continence. While rare, other signs include vom-iting, tremors, and seizures with multiple deathsreported due to aspiration. 8For this reason, the FDA and AVMA caution pet owners against usingthese products and the FDA has issued numerouswarnings to companies that sell products contain-ing cannabidiol. 9. Conclusion Overall, studies indicate great potential for canna-bis as a treatment modality. If research was lessrestricted, more safety and dosing studies could beconducted. This would likely help explain, and ul-timately prevent, poison-related deaths and begin toaddress concerns. What is important to remember is that pet owners aren't the people who face signicant consequencesfor trying these products. Although it is illegal tosell products containing cannabinoids, and illegal topurchase products containing them, the only partiesas of now who have been threatened to be heldlegally responsible are veterinarians and the canna-binoid-producing companies. Here is just one example of how a state medical board perceives veterinary use of cannabis-basedtreatments: The California Veterinary MedicalBoard states that, while marijuana is legal foradults 21 years and over, cannabis is illegal for usein animals. a In conclusion, the use of cannabis products for ani- mals warrants the attention of veterinarians and re-searchers and could one day be a wonderful treatmentmodality, but it cannot currently be recommended orstocked by veterinarians. It is suggested that boththe promises and perils of medical marijuana for ani-mals point to the need for science-based education,regulation, and research. So, while the aim is to dowhat is best for the patient, it is most appropriate toadvocate for change while remaining within the con-nes of the law. It is possible that one day cannabiswill be a legal and accepted treatment in the veteri-nary community, but many steps must be achievedbefore then. 9 274 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: NAVIGATING IMPORTANT CORPORATE AND LEGAL MATTERSAcknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of Veteri- nary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Chapman, Esq*; and Ted P. Vlahos, DVM, MS, DABVP (Equine) Whether the veterinarian is a prospective owner, trainer, agent, or veterinarian, the pre-purchase examination process is where a lot of things can go wrong which can cause a multitude of problems,and accusations, later. This exposure is true whether the examination is for a purchase, a leasewith a purchase option, or only for lease. This paper provides an outline of common ethics concerns and proposes best practices for the practitioner. Authors' addresses: Equine Law Group, LLC, 12008 respect to pre-purchase and pre-lease exami- nations, ethical concerns for the veterinary practi-tioner fall into several categories of concerns. Notall of these concerns involve lapses, acts, or omis-sions by the veterinarian, but all of them implicatethe veterinarian's role as an agent having a duty tothe client of the veterinarian. The general catego-ries of ethical concern, which are further discussedbelow, include the following: Failure to identify the client. Existence of a conflict of interest by relation-ship, ownership, fee structure, or agency. Full disclosure of known and potential conflicts. Full disclosure of pre-existing conditions andtreatments. Reasonable investigation of pre-existing condi-tions and treatments. Proper recordkeeping of the examinationprocess.Consistency between invoicing and examina-tion report. This article therefore discusses the ethical consider-ations when working with prospective purchasersand lessors during pre-purchase and pre-lease ex-aminations, the exposure from the perspective of theexamining veterinarians, and then suggests bestpractices from the various perspectives of whomeverthe veterinarian might represent in the purchase orlease transaction examination. 2. Identify for Whom the Veterinarian Is Working Knowledge of the identity of the client, the principalfor whom the veterinarian is examining the horse, isvery important. Often, the intermediaries in thepurchase or lease transaction have economic andnoneconomic interests at stake in the completion ofthe transaction, which may cause the information inthe examination to be conveyed to the prospectivepurchaser or lessee in a biased manner. If the vet-erinarian does not directly communicate ndings 276 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSPRE-PURCHASE EXAMINATIONS: ETHICAL DILEMMAS AND BEST PRACTICES NOTESand report to the person or entity for whom the veterinarian is the agent, then the veterinarian canhave no condence that the examination ndingshave been accurately conveyed. For the veterinar-ian, this is problematic, because if there is a disputelater between purchaser and seller relating to apre-existing condition or treatment and whether thecondition or treatment was properly disclosed, theveterinarian may nd the accused seller misrepre-senting the information conveyed to the veterinar-ian or his or her ndings conveyed to the purchaser. The practitioner, in a pre-purchase or pre-lease examination posture, is working as an agent on be-half of a principle: someone orsome entity. Because of this special relationship, the veterinarian willhave duties to that principal: to provide properexamination and to properly report. Those dutiesfall into not only the category of malpractice, whichis not the subject of discussion here, and into thenature of duciary duties, and ethical failings dis-cussed herein. 3. Fiduciary Duties of the Veterinarian The existence of a special relationship, created by the relative positions of the parties, such as in aveterinarian-client relationship, wherein the veter-inarian knows that the client is relying upon theexperience and specialized skills and position ofthe veterinarian to properly conduct, and convey thendings of, a pre-purchase or pre-lease examination.This duty arises from the position in which the par-ties place each other, whether or not there is acontract for services. a The most basic duciary duty is the duty of loyalty, which, in the context of pre-purchase ex-aminations, obligates the veterinarian to put theinterests of the client rst, ahead of the veterinar-ian's self-interest. That duty of loyalty requiresthe veterinarian to refrain from exploiting therelationship with the client for the veterinarian'spersonal benet, meaning for benet beyond beingpaid to conduct the pre-purchase examination. d A duciary duty arises expressly by contract whenthe parties specically agree to a relationship,such as the attorney-client or agent-principal re-lationship, that is considered to be a duciaryrelationship. eBy that denition, such duties ex - ist equally in the veterinarian-client relationship. The client justiably relies upon the veterinarian, as the agent, to exercise a certain requisite level ofskill and diligence in the pre-purchase or pre-leaseexamination. That duty does not end by clearingconflicts of interest and then examining the horse.Rather, duties extend to properly investigating theprior history of the horse, noting the limits of theinvestigation and disclosures obtained, and in en-suring the examination report actually arrives inthe hands of the client. Should the practitioner get past the \"relationship test,\" then the next areas of concern for the exam-ining practitioner relate to what the veterinarian is told and by whom. Consider that specter of the presence of a pre- existing medical condition of the horse and an owneror owner's agent's failure to disclose that medicalhistory has the potential to directly affect the pro-spective purchaser's ability to make an informeddecision whether to lease and ultimately purchasethe horse. It is customary in the equine industry tohave a horse evaluated extensively by a licensedequine veterinarian prior to purchase (hereinafterreferred to a pre-purchase examination [PPE]).It is also customary for a potential lessee to have aless extensive evaluation of a horse at the time alease commences, only to have their veterinarianperform a more extensive radiographic, ultrasound,and endoscopic evaluation prior to any eventualpurchase. However, the scope and extent of PPE imaging and diagnostic testing is often premised upon theprevious medical history of the horse as provided bythe seller, lessor, or their agent. Consider that ifthe selling or leasing party is not forthcoming to theexamining veterinarian, then the scope of the exam-ination will be curtailed. This places the examin-ing veterinarian, in a difcult position, opining as tothe present health of the horse, while potentially nothaving been fully informed of the pre-existing con-ditions or prior treatments of the horse. When this delta between present examination to past, relevant information is compared against theethical consideration that the single most importantgoal of the examining veterinarian is to provide thebuyer or lessee with information as to the health andsoundness of the prospective horse, then the poten-tial for misleading information being construed fromthe pre-purchase or pre-lease examination is great. Prospective purchasers and lessors rely upon the veterinarians to provide adequate information sothat those parties may make an informed decision toproceed or decline the purchase or lease. Consider,however, upon whom the veterinarian relies. Atthe time of the examination, the examining veteri-narian relies extensively, if not exclusively, on themedical history and related information as providedby the seller or lessor at the time of the examination. The failure to disclose the pre-existing conditions of a horse denies the client of the examining veter-inarian the opportunity to make an informed deci-sion to lease the horse, and may subsequently placethe purchaser or lessor, as well as the horse, at riskof serious injury. Consider that the American As-sociation of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) Guidelines for Reporting Pre-purchase Examinations contains two material statements: \"...It is the buyer's responsibility to determineif the horse is suitable...\"; and \"...It remains the sole responsibility of the vet-erinarian to determine the extent and depth ofeach examination.\" b AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 277PRE-PURCHASE EXAMINATIONS: ETHICAL DILEMMAS AND BEST PRACTICESIn some cases, given the extent of the chronic dis- ease, condition, or off-label medication use presentin a horse at the time of the examination, had thehistory been disclosed, a reasonable equine veteri-narian would not nd such a horse healthy for theintended purpose then or at any time in the future.Therein lies several ethical pitfalls for the veterinar-ian. The AAEP Position on Sale Disclosure pro- vides guidance that: \"AAEP supports the position that when ahorse is sold, any known invasive surgery, dis-ease, injury, or congenital defect which is notapparent, should be disclosed to the intendedbuyer by the owner and/or agent.\" \"The AAEP supports disclosure of ownershipby single or multiple owners of a horse at thetime of offering for sale.\" c 4. Conflicts of Interest and Self Dealing Conflicts of interest arise when the practitioner hassome relationship, interest, or inherent bias that isaffected by the examination of the horse. An equityinterest in the horse or business that owns the horseis a clear example. More nuanced is a present busi-ness relationship with the seller of the horse. Apersonal, intimate relationship with the seller orone of the selling entity's principals presents an-other form of ethics conflict. Most commonly, a con-flict arises when a business relationship of thepractitioner with the seller exists. Any of theserelationships should cause the practitioner to eitherclear the conflicts through written disclosure andacceptance by the client, or (and appropriate in mostcircumstances of conflict) decline engagement forthe pre-purchase or pre-lease examination. The veterinarian's duties to identify and clear or avoid conflicts of interest are part of what waspreviously described herein as \"duciary duties.\"Such duties are not always considered by examiningveterinarians, although the ethical guidelines of theAAEP promote their existence and observance. f 5. Concerns from the Perspective of the Prospective Purchaser or Lessee If the veterinarian is examining a horse as the vet- erinarian for a client intending to purchase or leasea horse, there are key considerations to keep inmind: What disclosures as to the health and sound-ness history has the client of the veterinarianand the veterinarian received from the selleror lessor or their agents? What disclosures as to the health and sound-ness history has the client of the veterinarianand the veterinarian received from the client'sown agents? What disclosures have been made from theseller or lessor or their agents to the client ofthe veterinarian or the veterinarian as to theregular course of treatment, maintenance,medication, medicine, training, and shoeingfor the horse? How have any of those disclosures been trans-mitted, such as in writing or orally? Is the examining veterinarian (or the practice),someone (or an entity) who has little or nonancial or business relationship to the selleror lessor or their agents? Has the examining veterinarian disclosed tothe client any relationship that does exist be-tween the veterinarian and the seller, lessor,or their agents? Who recommended the veterinarian as the vet-erinarian for the examination? What is the understanding as to by whom theveterinarian is employed? The actual pur-chaser/lessor or their agent? Someone else? Has the veterinarian conrmed who is the cli-ent and how so? Has the veterinarian been informed by theseller/lessor and their agent, as well asthe client's agent of the intended purpose ofthe horse which the veterinarian isexamining? Has the veterinarian been told whether thehorse is being considered for competition at aparticular level of a particular discipline, forinvestment, resale, or for use and retirement? Who is directing the veterinarian as to thescope and extent of the examination (i.e., num-ber and location of radiographs)? Did the veterinarian provide a written exami-nation directly to the client? Did the veterinarian do so before the clientapproved the purchase or lease and closed thetransaction? If the veterinarian is then asked to execute aninsurance health certicate for the new owneror lessee, what statements will the veterinar-ian be required to make to the insurance com-pany? (To wit: the veterinarian's certicateoften makes statements in answer questionsas to past history or conditions of the horse). Upon whose information did the veterinarianrely when executing that insurance certicate?(Note that knowingly providing false informa-tion to an insurance company could negatecoverage or form the basis for a claim againstthe veterinarian by the client of the veterinar-ian or the insurance company). Clients have certain legal rights to full disclosure.Florida, Kentucky, and California in particular havelaws that specically address horse sales, whileother states follow their consumer protection laws. g Without proper disclosure to the veterinarian, as the examining veterinarian, of the prior conditions,health, and treatment of the horse, the veterinariancannot render an opinion upon which the client canuse to make an informed decision whether at all to 278 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSPRE-PURCHASE EXAMINATIONS: ETHICAL DILEMMAS AND BEST PRACTICESpurchase, lease with an option, or lease. Further, the client cannot insist upon removal of disclaimers,or the inclusion of exceptions or pre-conditions in thetransaction to account for any pre-existing condi-tions of the horse. The veterinarian really is traveling in the dark without guidance if not informed of what has beengoing on with the horse and what the program is tokeep the horse healthy and sound. Further, theveterinarian may not appreciate the complex busi-ness and nancial relationships amongst all of theparties to the transaction that might affect the ac-curacy or level of detail that flows to the veterinar-ian as the veterinarian makes decisions. Theveterinarian should also save texts, emails, scans,photos, and attachments related to the examinationand discussions of the ndings thereof. The veter-inarian should preserve what the veterinarian wasinformed concerning the history of the horse andabout the pre-purchase examination or pre-leaseexamination. 6. Concerns for Agents Agents in equine transactions are those who repre- sent a principal, usually for commission or othercompensation. If the veterinarian is being compen-sated by anyone in an equine purchase or leasetransaction, it is likely the veterinarian is an agent.If others are speaking to the veterinarian on behalfof the buyer or seller, then they are agents. Often,whether the veterinarian was an agent, and forwhich party or parties, becomes an issue. If theveterinarian is working for, or being compensatedby, multiple parties to a transaction, then the vet-erinarian is considered a \"dual agent.\" Somestates, for example Florida, require disclosure of aveterinarian's agency, dual agency, commission, andrequire consent of the buyer and seller or lessor andlessee. h Because these general principals apply to agents, as an agent of the purchaser or lessee, the veteri-narian may have his or her own perspective on theabove set of bullet-point concerns, which the veteri-narian should consider during the pre-purchase ex-amination or pre-lease examination process. As anagent, the veterinarian should be mindful and takecare to note where information is coming from, howit is relayed, and how the veterinarian discloses it tothe agent's principal. It is not infrequent that in apurchase or lease dispute, someone says, \"I told theagent,\" or \"the agent did not tell me.\" If the veterinarian is the prospective buyer's agent, the veterinarian should insist on copies of allof the seller's or lessor's veterinary records, or thecontacts to obtain them. The veterinarian shouldthen obtain those records and be sure they are givento the pre-purchase veterinarian. The veterinarianmust obtain a written pre-purchase examinationfrom the veterinarian and send that, along with therecords, to the prospective buyer, the principal.If the veterinarian is the seller or lessor's agent, the veterinarian should be sure to disclose any knowledge about the horse and make it clear, anddocument the transmission of information and pro-vide or offer access to the veterinary records. Re-member the examining veterinarian, is relying uponthese representations while examining the horse, soaccuracy is important. Further, the veterinarianmay nd the representations are included in a laterinsurance certicate, so be accurate to avoid anymisadventure in an insurance coverage disputelater. The point is, as the veterinarian conducting the examination goes about the role in a purchase orlease transaction, whether speaking to the otherside of the transaction, be it other agents or princi-pals, or communicating with the pre-purchaseveterinarian, or communicating with their ownprincipal, the veterinarian should keep a docu-mented record of what is being said, by whom andwhen. The veterinarian should also save texts,emails, scans, photos, and attachments. Thatdocumentation may be useful later. 7. Best Practices for Pre-Purchase and Pre-Lease Examining Veterinarians With the above concerns in mind, there are some best practices the examining veterinarian mightconsider undertaking the following practices: Note in written records and written pre-pur-chase examination report who exactly waspresent at the pre-purchase examination. Note as well who dened the scope of theexamination. Find out and note the intended purpose of thepurchase or lease. Note what was disclosed about the past healthand soundness history of the horse and fromwhom each of the disclosures was made. Obtain the contact information of the principal(the prospective buyer or lessee) for whom theveterinarian are actually working and sendthat principal a copy of the written pre-pur-chase examination report. Prepare a written pre-purchase examinationreport contemporaneously or immediately af-ter with the examination. Avoid subjective opinion in any report. Thereport should consist of clinical observations,from which the buyer can draw conclusions. Avoid the same when interpretingradiographs. The veterinarian should, however, explainndings adequately in the report for a lay per-son to understand, and in further detail ifasked. Do not accept an agent's word that the agentwill send the report to the principal. The ex-amining veterinarian will want to do this andretain a copy of that transmittal. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 279PRE-PURCHASE EXAMINATIONS: ETHICAL DILEMMAS AND BEST PRACTICESNote in written records any subsequent con- versations the veterinarian has with theprospective buyer or lessee should the veteri-narian have occasion to speak with them. Do not let the agent retain the veterinarian asthe agent's veterinarian for the examination\u2014the veterinarian is working for the prospectivebuyer or lessee and any reports and billing andreport distribution should reflect that agency. Experience has shown that a large part of equinetransaction disputes concern allegations of non-disclosure of prior health or soundness is-sues. When the ngers start pointing, the veteri-narian does not want to be accused of not informingsomeone of something. Conversely, to avoid accu-sation, the veterinarian should be able to dive intothe records and demonstrate who told the veterinar-ian what, or did not disclose, during the pre-pur-chase examination or pre-lease examinationprocess. The veterinarian should also be able todenitely articulate for whom the veterinarian wasworking at the time of the examination. An ounceof prevention to understand and record matters atthe time of the examination is worth a pound of cureto try and recreate from memory and intention whathappened at a pre-purchase examination or pre-lease examination in the past. With those thoughts in mind, the next time a pre-purchase or pre-lease examination is on the ho-rizon, take a moment to stop and go through stan-dard practices and adjust them so that they becomebest practices.

Introduction The musculoskeletal architecture of the modern horse is a textbook study in the specialized anatom-ical adaptations of cursorial locomotion. Duringthe peregrination of the equid from North Americato the steps of Asia, the frame of the horse grew instature as they migrated from semitropical intomore open savanna environments where speed andendurance were necessary for survival. 1It is dur- ing this period of the horses' evolution that uniquelocomotor adaptations to the musculoskeletal sys-tem developed. 2 2. Modern Equine Development Over approximately 55 million years, the fossil re-cords show that multiple toes evolved into a singletoe and the bones of the lower limb elongated thatresulted in greater potential leverage powered bythe major muscle groups concentrated in the upperpart of the limb. The sesamoid bones becamehighly developed, giving the tendo-ligamentousstructures of the suspensory apparatus mechanicaladvantage. The arrangement of a single hardenedtoe, skeletal adaptations, elongated tendons, andproximal migration of muscle groups made way for astrong, energy-efcient animal whose lower limbfunction used a high degree of automaticity. 2,33. Structure and Function of Specic Anatomy The specic adaptations that influence the pelvic limbs work on the principles of u sing bone shape, bone length, and bone position to increase lever-age; tendinous muscle development for passiveweight bearing and synchronous the elongation of distal tendons for elasticrecoil. 4These systems work in concert to facili- tate the transfer of potential, kinetic, and elasticenergy, reducing the chemical energy required ofskeletal muscle. 5 The locomotion characteristics of the horse result in the hindlimbs contacting the ground before theforelimbs in gaits having a suspension phase. 6 Therefore, the ability of the hindlimbs to dissipate the forces of ground impact is essential for lifelongsoundness. In comparison to the straight force vector position of the knee when receiving load, the capability of thehindlimb to dissipate energy is signicantly in-creased by the reciprocal flexing actions of the hockand stifle while decelerating. At no point of thestride do the proximal joints of the pelvic limb re-ceive load in a straight force vector position. 6 An underpinning function of the tarsal joint is to actively stabilize the leg while dissipating energyduring the deceleration phases of the stride. 6The 281HOW TO MANAGE HOOF LAMENESS I NOTEStarsocrural joint has the greatest range of motion of the hock, and the increased leverage provided by theextended moment arm of the calcaneus adds me-chanical advantage to the supercial digital common tendon in re-sisting the tensile forces developed during stancephases. In contrast to the \"open kinetic energy chain sys- tem\" of thoracic limbs (in which the body mass issuspended within the shoulder girdle by brousmuscles), the pelvic limbs (via the ball and socketjoint of the hip) are in direct contact with the axialspine, which results in a \"closed kinetic energy chainsystem\" that is more efcient in storing and releas-ing energy. 7 Pelvic limb muscles have been found to have larger volumes and shorter fascicle length thanthoracic limb muscles, 8which facilitate a greater ability to generate explosive power and enduranceand serve as a spring dampener to dissipatevibration. 2 The mechanical apparatus of the hindlimbs has to provide energy for propulsion through the concentric action of muscles, provide energy for decelerationand stability through the eccentric and isometricaction of muscles, and store elastic energy withinadapted muscle, ligament, and tendon. 4,6,9 The makeup of the proximal joints of the pelvic limb function to resist the frictional coefcient of theground reaction by the eccentric action of musclescontrolling hip, stifle, and hock flexion during thedeceleration phases of the stride. 7,10In addition, the tendo-musculature and collateral ligaments sup-porting these joints must resist torsional momentsand maintain stability until midstance 2,10,11and, simultaneously, elastic energy is stored in theadapted soft tissue structures and is used to facili-tate propulsion. 4 There are signicant morphological and func- tional differences between the thoracic and pelviclimbs. Basic functional requirements of the fore-limbs and hindlimbs will show that the front limbsbear approximately 60-65% of body weight, as thehorse stands and at critical times of the stancephases. Hindlimbs function to dissipate shock,provide stability for deceleration, and provide im-pulsion for forward movement. These explanationsdescribe basic functions but are too simple for accu-rate biomechanical assessment and comparativestudies with other species. In general, anatomical morphology dictates the function of structures or physical systems and isbest described in this quote by Dr. MiltonHildebrand: \"The degree of specialization of an anatomical structure is proportional to the importance for thespecies survival.\" Some examples of forelimb to hindlimb anatomi- cal differences are as follows:Stay apparatus: patellar locking (skeletal) of the stifle and tendon of the biceps brachii (softtissue) of shoulder. MT3 is longer than MC3. Geometry of MT3 results in a greater resis-tance to medial/lateral (M/L) and dorsal/plan-tar (D/P) bending proximal sesamoid bones of the foreleg arelarger and more rounded than those of thehindleg. The fourth metatarsal bone is larger than thefourth metacarpal bone, providing a greatersurface area for the tendons andstructural ligaments. The supercial digital flexor tendomuscularsystem of the hindlimb has very little musclemass compared to the forelimb, resulting in amore ligamentous function. The overall increased length of the caudal in facilities agreater capacity for elastic recoil compared tothe front limb. Energy saving reciprocal apparatus of the hockand stifle: there is no such apparatus in theforeleg. The hock is designed to receive load dynami-cally, whereas the knee must remain staticwhile loading and at midstance. There is no superior check ligament associatedwith the SDFT in hindlimbs. The inferior check ligament associated withthe DDFT is signicantly smaller inhindlimbs. 4. Anatomy of the Reciprocal Apparatus and Suspensory Apparatus The supercial flexor tendon/muscle and the bu- laris tertius work in concert as mainstays of the\"reciprocal\" apparatus during rest and to simultane-ously flex the hock and stifle during liftoff and initialphases of protraction with a marked degree of auto-maticity and minimal expenditure of energy. The supercial flexor muscle originates from the supracondylar fossae situated caudoproximal thelateral condyle of the femur. Its mass is signi-cantly less than but is much more tendinous than itscounterpart on the forelimb. The actual musclebelly is encased in thick myofacia and is reduced toan elongated brous muscle adapted to resistchronic tension. The SDFT has no accessory liga-ment, as its tendon forms a cap,and its on the calcaneal tuber-osity continues distad until its terminal inser-tion at the plantar/proximal border of the middlephalanx. The bularis tertius (formally peroneus tertius) originates on the lateral femoral condyle andcourses down the cranial aspect of extensor, lateral extensor, and tibialis cra-nialis. Distally, it passes deep to the tendon of the 282 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO MANAGE HOOF LAMENESS Itibialis cranialis and divides into two branches ex- tending and inserting dorsally and laterally into thedistal row or tarsal bones, the metatarsal tuberosityof the cannon bone, and laterally onto the fourthmetacarpal, respectively. 14 The bularis tertius is constituted mainly of ten- dinous ber with little skeletal muscle mass lendingto its static tensile resistance capabilities. The deep digital flexor muscle heads originate from the proximal caudal bula and the caudola-teral margin of the proximal tibia. The less-devel-oped deep digital muscle mass and diminished sizeof the subtarsal accessory ligament of the pelvic limbare consistent with its diminished function com-pared to the increased need for tensile resistance ofthe thoracic limb. The \"suspensory apparatus\" of the distal limb is the term that describes the mechanism of supportand function of the joints of the equine distal limbduring the static and dynamic loading phases of thestride. Soft tissue and skeletal adaptations work inconcert to provide the loading capacity of the jointsof the digit that give horses the fluid locomotioncharacteristics that humans value. The suspen-sory apparatus of the modern horse is another ex-ample of developmental adaptations that minimizethe use of musculature, resulting in an overall de-crease in weight and an economical expenditure ofenergy. The suspensory apparatus has three primary functions: Support Shock dissipation Impulsion The anatomical structures involved in the suspen-sory apparatus are as follows: The main body of the suspensory ligament. The medial and lateral branches of the suspen-sory ligament. The medial and lateral extensor branches ofthe tendons. The collateral ligaments of the distal interpha-langeal joint. This system, in combination with the palmar/pas-tern and collateral ligaments of the digit, functionsto maintain the fetlock, pastern, and cofn joint in astraight phalangeal alignment when standing.It also serves to resist over dorsiflexion of the fetlockand hyper flexion of the cofn joint under load. The suspensory ligament originates from the pal- mar proximal aspect of the 2 nd,3rd, and 4thmetatar- sal bones. It courses distally between the splintbones, adjacent to the plantar aspect of the cannonbone, and bifurcates into medial and lateralbranches prior to the nodules of the splint bones andsubsequently inserting onto to of sesamoids. extensor tendon, ultimatelyinserts extensor process of the distal pha-lanx. Muscle bers found in the body of the sus-pensory ligament are evidence of the interosseousmuscles' adaptation into its present ligamentousmorphology and perhaps its ability to withstand thetensile forces generated during the loading phases ofthe stride. The tensile load on the suspensory lig-ament increases and decreases dependent of the an-gulation of the fetlock within each case. Theproximal sesamoids and navicular bone are criticalto the system by providing signicant mechanicaladvantage to the tendons and ligaments. The well-developed sesamoid bones, in particular the proxi-mal sesamoids, serve to increase the skeletalmoment arm of the plantar aspect of the sesamoid a consistent angle of insertion for theDDFT as it fans out to insert onto the semi-lunarcrest of the distal phalanx or P3. The navicularbursae interposes between the flexor surface of thenavicular bone and surface DDFT.The DDFT signicant brous insertions theaxial projections of the ungular cartilage. The straight sesamoidian ligament originates from the distal sesamoidian bro cartilage situateddistally on the medial and lateral proximal sesamoidbones. Functionally, it is a continuation of themain body of the suspensory ligament and is theonly one of four distal sesamoidian thatextend distally to the proximal plantar aspect of themiddle phalanx. The middle or oblique sesamoid-ian ligament has two branches. Each branch orig-inates from the bottom of the medial and lateralsesamoid bones, respectively, join together, and in-sert onto the middle plantar pedicle of the proximalphalanx. As the middle sesamoidian ligament doesnot cross over the interphalangeal joint, the tensileloads are not directly attributable to the angularposition of the fetlock joint. There is very littlereporting in the literature as to the specic functionof the oblique sesamoidian ligament, but most bio-mechanical anatomists believe its function is to aidin support of the tensile load on the suspensoryapparatus and to give torsional stability to the fet-lock joint under load. The cursorial adaptations to the musculoskeleture of the horse that occurred from his smaller digit-grade posture to the relatively large framed animalof the modern ungulate are examples of the efcientuse, storage, and return of energy systems devel-oped over the horses' evolution. The migration oflarge muscle mass to the proximal body results inthe ability to generate large eccentric, concentric, AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H114082020 283HOW TO MANAGE HOOF LAMENESS Iand isometric forces in the stance phases of the stride. The adaptation of musculotendinous bodieslike the supercial flexor muscle, the bularis ter-tius, and the interosseous muscle results in the abil-ity to resist chronic tensile forces in the decelerationand midstance phases and initiates joint flexion ofthe pelvic limb during the late stance phase andearly swing phase. The resulting loss of musclemass has made the distal limb much lighter andeasier to control the centrifugal forces generated inlate swing phase and moment of ground contact. 2 The size of and locomotion characteristics of the horse dictate a musculoskeletal system that is ableto dissipate concussive forces and resist tensile andtorsional forces generated during athletic competi-tion. It is this architecture of specialized skeletal,ligament, and tendon adaptations that facilitate theathletic potential of the horse.

Thus, conformational traits comprisesegment lengths, segment angles, and the orientationof the leg to the ground. Many authors consider theratios of the lengths and angles and their (a)symmetryto be more important than the absolute values. Con- formation is mainly influenced by the genetic makeupof a horse and is often breed specic, while other fac-tors (such as nutrition, aging, podiatry) have a muchsmaller influence. Foot conformation describes the size, shape, and (a)symmetry of the foot and while genetics also playa large role, the foot\u2014unlike conformation of therest of the body\u2014is much more influenced by envi-ronmental factors, such as usage, nutrition, and es-pecially podiatric management. The foot forms theinterface between the ground and the horse andconformation of the foot hence not only influenceshow the load of the body weight of the horse isdistributed over/within the foot, it also influenceshow it is affecting the rest of the horse.2. Understanding the Relationship Between Extensor and Flexor Moments Following Newton's third law, for every action (force) in nature there is an equal and opposite re-action. 1The force the body generates when in con- tact with the ground is called ground reaction force(GRF). The GRF has a magnitude and a direction.Its magnitude is dependent on only two factors:how heavy the horse is and how fast it moves.Nothing but those two factors can change that and each foot (and the rest of the leg) has to cope withthat. What is influenced by foot conformation (andall the factors that determine foot conformation) isits direction, especially where the GRF vector entersthe foot. This point is called the \"point of forceapplication\" or the \"point of zero moment\" (POZ).This in turn influences where the GRF vector runsin relation to the joints. As the horse's leg is notstraight, the GRF exerts a rotational force (especially the fetlock and cofn joints);this rotational force is called a \"moment.\" The dis-tance between the GRF vector and a joint (the centerof rotation to be precise) determines how much \"le-verage\" the GRF has on this joint and it is called theGRF moment arm. The further the GRF vector is AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 285HOW TO MANAGE HOOF LAMENESS I NOTESaway from a joint, the bigger its moment arm and hence leverage on this joint. If nothing would coun-teract this, the leg (and the horse) would simplycollapse. The GRF acts on the front of the horse'sleg, also called the extensor side (as this is where legextension happens). To prevent the leg from col-lapsing, there needs to be an equal force on the otherside (the flexor side of the leg) to counteract this.This is achieved by the spring-like properties of thesuspensory apparatus and the deep and supercialflexor muscle-tendon units and their supporting lig-aments in combination with their moment armsaround each joint 2; the moment arms are the dis- tances between the tendons and the center of rota-tion of each joint; hence, the flexor moment is theproduct of the force in those soft-tissue structuresand their moment arms. These moment arms donot change as they are morphologically constrainedby the presence of sesamoid bones: the proximalsesamoid bones at the level of the fetlock and thenavicular bone at the level of the cofn joint. In-creasing the moment arm of tendons/muscles is in-deed the \"job\" of sesamoid bones, thus decreasingthe force on the tendon/muscles and hence protect-ing their associated soft-tissue structures from over-loading. In the case of the horse leg, every increasein extensor moment will require an increase inflexor moment. As the flexor moment arm is con-stant this will result in an increase in force in theflexor tendons/suspensory ligament. A more de-tailed explanation of horse leg biomechanics can befound in the book by Wilson and Weller. 3 3. How Does Foot Conformation Influence the Extensor/Flexor Moment System? In the most simple terms: the longer the toe, the further forward the POZ is positioned and the fur-ther away the GRF vector is from the joint center ofrotation, thus increasing the extensor moment armat all joint levels and increasing the total extensormoment. This requires an increase in flexor mo-ment to prevent the leg from collapsing and in-creases the force on the flexor tendons/suspensoryligament. Lengthening of the toe is obviously anormal physiological effect that is caused by horngrowth and its effect has been described. 4,5Short- ening the toe or elongating the heels moves the POZfurther back and the GRF vector closer to the centerrotation of the joints, thus resulting in smaller mo-ment arms on the extensor side, an overall smallerextensor moment, and hence flexor moment andsmaller forces in the flexor structures. Shorteningthe toe can obviously be achieved by trimmingand/or shoeing. Heel extensions and heel wedgeshave a similar effect in terms of moving the POZbackward and an overall decrease in flexor moment;however, heel wedges have the additional effect ofunloading the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) andshifting the load to the other flexor structures. Changes in conformation and moments not only affects the tendons, but also other musculoskeletalstructures. For example, a change in tendon forcealso affects the sesamoid bones they are associatedwith. As the force in the tendons go up,the more pressure and strain they exert on theirrespective sesamoid bone. This is well documentedfor the navicular bone where every degree change inthe solar border of the pedal bone results in a 4%change in strain in the DDFT and the pressure itputs on the navicular bone under. 6 Changes in conformation (natural or podiatry re- lated) also changes the way bones and joints areloaded. For example, heel wedges increase thepressure in the dorsal area of the cofn joint. 7 4. Lateromedial Conformation So far only the leg has been considered as a two-dimensional structure with its movement con-strained to the sagittal plane. While horseanatomy is optimized for movement in the sagittalplane, there is of course movement in the otherplanes as well albeit to a much smaller degree.At each joint the GRF vector exerts a moment in 3Dand if there is an increase of the moment on one side,this will result in an increase on the other side andan uneven loading of the joint surfaces as well as anuneven strain in the collateral ligaments. TheGRF always follows the direction of the extension.If there is a lateromedial imbalance of the foot withthe medial side higher than the lateral side, this willresult in an increase in pressure on the medial sideand an increase in strain in the lateral collateralligament. 5. How Does This Translate into the Real World? Using Newtonian physics to explain leg mechanicsin a horse leave one vital component out: the \"bio\"in \"biomechanics.\" Unlike (most) manmade struc-tures, biological tissues can heal and horses can usetheir legs differently. Indeed, looking at the confor-mation of horses standing does not equal how theyuse their legs, 8,9and horses show change in their locomotion changes to compensate for growth re-lated changes in conformation. 10It also does not take into account the effect of surfaces on biome-chanics or on vibrations (which are also an impor-tant factor in the development of orthopedicdisorders). Despite all these other factors, epidemiological studies have shown that there is a correlation be-tween foot conformation and injury. It has beenshown that the odds suffering from DDFT lesionsand navicular bone pathology change with solar an-gle of the pedal bone. 11Horses with a mediolateral foot imbalance have been shown to be more prone tocollateral ligament problems, 12although this corre- lation was much more subtle than the relationshipbetween dorsopalmar foot conformation and prob-lems with the navicular apparatus. Due to the clinical nature of these studies it is, however, unclear as to what is cause and what iseffect. Many horses suffering from foot-related 286 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO MANAGE HOOF LAMENESS Ilameness enter a vicious cycle as it has been shown that horses with palmar foot pain adopt a toe-rstlanding pattern, which shifts the POZ forward andin turn increases the strain in the flexor structuresand the pressure on the navicular bone. 13 6. Conclusion Foot conformation influences the load distributionnot only within the musculoskeletal structureswithin the foot but also the rest of the leg. Themajority of orthopedic problems in horses are degen-erative in nature and the result of repetitive over-loading that exceeds the natural repair capacity ofthe body tissues. Their development is multifacto-rial; however, considering the fragility of some of themusculoskeletal structures optimization of load, dis-tribution is key and paying attention to foot confor-mation is absolutely vital.

AAEP IHow to Understand Lameness: The Link Between Force and Movement Asymmetry Thilo Pfau, Dr.-Ing., FHEA Veterinary decision making during the equine lameness examination follows a logical structure that is well suited for the incorporation of additional knowledge. The \"lameness mechanism\" nicely linksreduced force production with the affected limb to the major visual indicators of lameness: head nodand hip hike. Newtonian mechanics provides supporting evidence for this link. Modern sensor orcamera-based techniques allow for a straightforward quantication of head and pelvic movementasymmetry as decision-making aids\u2014in particular for overcoming the limits of the human visualsystem and for reducing bias after the elimination of pain via diagnostic analgesia. Because allstages of the lameness examination can be quantied with technological aids, i.e., straight line, lunge,ridden exercise, flexion tests, and improvement after diagnostic analgesia, these aids can also be usedin symmetrical bilaterally lame horses. Additional measurements, such as the movement of thewithers (compared to the movement of the head), provide extra information that is not easilyappreciated by eye and can help differentiate between true forelimb lameness and horses showing acompensatory head nod. Author's address: Department of Clinical Science and Services, TheRoyal Veterinary College, University of London, the Lameness Examination The veterinary lameness examination typically fol- lows a logical structure with the overall aims of (1)establishing w hether the horse is lame or not, (2) grading the severity of one (or more) detected gaitdecit(s), and (3) to localizing the source(s) of the def-icit(s). 1The structure, which typically involves a gait assessment in different gaits, on different surfaces,in-hand, on the lunge and/or ridden, before/after flex-ion tests, and before/after diagnostic analgesia, ismeant to facilitate the detection and grading of lame- ness as well as identication of the most promis-ing regions for conducting further investigativesteps, typically involving diagnostic imaging.However, the multitude of different exercise con-ditions, under which the horse needs to be as- sessed, also poses a challenge to human decision making: not always will all detected signs be inagreement. Thus, human decision making in sit-uations like these can be \"suboptimal.\" 2The level of intra- and interobserver agreement for theveterinary lameness exam is well documented. The reported low level of agreement 3,4may be related to the fact that there seem to be a multi- tude of \"features\" that experienced veterinarianswill consider when visually observing a horse forsigns of lameness and sometimes lameness scoringalso involves a second source of variability, such as a rider and his/her influence on the horse's movement. 5 288 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO MANAGE HOOF LAMENESS I NOTES2. A Common Mechanism As a consequence of the multistage process followed during the lameness examination, identifying a uni-fying \"mechanism\" that is applicable to most (orideally all) lame horses would be advantageous forreducing the complexity of quantifying sensitive andspecic movement parameters for differentiating be-tween nonlame and lame horses. Commonly, diag-nostic analgesia is instrumental in identifying theanatomical region that appears to be causing painduring movement, i.e., the horse moves substan-tially differently after eliminating the pain from ananatomical region or from a specic structure. 6,7 Common logic indicates that if pain is experiencedwithin a limb that an animal will aim to reduce theforce that is produced by this limb; as an analogy,imagine a stone in one of your shoes and how thisaffects your willingness to make use of the affectedlimb during walking (or even running). 3. How to Assess Force After having identied a (unifying) mechanism,namely decreased forces produced with the affectedlimb, the next question is: what is the best method todetect a change in force production? Of course, onecan make use of sophisticated (and more or lessexpensive) devices, such as force platforms, forceshoes, or pressure mats. These devices measurethe force produced during ground contact and pro-duce accurate and precise readings of the groundreaction forces, i.e., the force exerted from theground onto the animal when a limb (or multiplelimbs) is in contact with the surface. 8-11 4. Kinematics of Lameness For centuries, veterinarians and farriers have founda much easier way of identifying the affected limbthat does not require the measurement of force. 12 It simply involves careful visual observation of ahorse in motion. Typically performed, and mosteasily explained, in trot, it comes down to identify-ing the existence and severity of a head nod, hiphike, or pelvic hike as an indicator of the existenceand grade of lameness. Newtonian mechanics can then be used to explain how these kinematic (movement) features are di-rectly related to kinetic changes (changes in force),in particular the reduction in force production dur-ing the stance phase of the lame limb. 13 5. Head Nod and Hip Hike and the Link to Force Asymmetry Head nod and hip hike are features that have been described in multiple studies with two- or three-dimensional kinematics and more recently also withthe use of inertial measurement units. 14-17Both features are typically described in trot, a two-beat,diagonal gait with simultaneous ground contact ofdiagonal pairs of limbs. 18The two-beat nature of the trot is advantageous, as there is a clear differ-entiation between the period of ground contact of adiagonal pair of limbs, the following aerial phase,subsequently followed by the ground contact of theopposite diagonal pair of limbs, and nally a secondaerial phase. This means that the full stride cyclecan be divided easily into two halves, namely, \"downthen up\" during ground contact, upward movementcontinued into the aerial phase and then downwardmovement in the second half of the aerial phase,leading into the stance phase of the other diagonalpair. In the nonlame horse, the two halves of the trot stride are expected to follow near-identical verticalmovement of the upper body, and the horse is pro-ducing the same amount of force with both frontlimbs. In the front limb lame horse, which pro-duces less force with the affected front limb, therewill be less vertical movement during the stancephase of the lame limb and more vertical movementduring the stance phase of the sound limb. 9,14 The situation is slightly more complicated for the hindlimb lame horse: the hip hike, often describedas an increased vertical movement of the tubercoxae on the side of the lame limb, is a paramountsign of hindlimb lameness. 15At rst sight, this indicator may appear counter-intuitive: why wouldthere be increased movement on the side of the lamelimb? Does this not contradict the paradigm of\"less force, less movement\"? A closer look at thetiming of the increased movement amplitude on theside of the lame limb indicates that this movement isactually happening during the ground contact of thenonlame limb. 13,15,19 The same mechanism applies to forelimb and hindlimb lameness: less vertical movement dur-ing the stance phase of the lame fore or hindlimb.It is simply the case that the increased rotation ofthe pelvis during nonlame stance further ampli-es the increased vertical movement during thenonlame stance phase. The nature of the rotation\u2014when the nonlame limb is in groundcontact\u2014means that it amplies the movement am-plitude on the contralateral side, i.e., on the side ofthe lame limb. The reduced force during lamestance has the opposite effect: restricted rotation ofthe pelvis. Hence, the already reduced verticalmovement is not amplied to the same degree on thecontralateral (nonlame) side. 6. Newton's Laws of Motion and Math Newton's laws of motion explain why head nod andhip hike are such important parameters for identi-fying and grading lameness. Experience showsthat head nod and hip hike are reliable indicators oflameness. However, there is a more compelling ar-gument that links the kinematic signs of lamenessto the underlying force changes-Newton's secondlaw of motion. It states that when a force F isacting on an object of mass m, it causes the object toaccelerate by a (or in equation form, F /H11005m*a). So, less vertical force F will lead to less vertical AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 289HOW TO MANAGE HOOF LAMENESS Iacceleration a (the mass m of the horse of course stays the same). Secondly, mathematically, accel-eration is related to velocity (the speed of the move-ment) and to displacement (how much the objectmoves) by integration over time. Effectively, re-duced force production means less acceleration ofthe attached body part, a lower speed, and a reducedamplitude of movement (displacement). As a consequence, head nod and hip hike, which logically relate to reduced force production in thelame limb, can also be derived from Newton's secondlaw of motion and some math. 7. Quantication of Movement Asymmetry Now that the relationship between head nod and hiphike and the underlying mechanism of reduced forceproduction are clear, think about how to make use oftechnology to aid human decision making during thelameness examination. It has been shown that hu-mans have a limited ability to appreciate movementasymmetry below a threshold of 20 to 25% ampli-tude difference. 20In a horse with a typical vertical movement amplitude of 60-100 mm for the upperbody during a trot stride cycle, this level of 20-25%translates into 12-25 mm of movement asymmetrythat may be necessary to detect this asymmetrywith condence. Modern technology is more ad-vanced than that. Camera-based three-dimen-sional motion capture systems can be calibrated tobelow millimeter accuracy over capture volumes large enough to cover an entire riding arena. 21 Inertial sensors are accurate (for quantifying dis-placement during near-cyclical movement) down toa few millimeters 22,23and have the additional ad- vantage of in-built data loggers or wireless linksextending to ranges of 50 m or more. Hence, thesetechniques provide the necessary freedom for thehorse to move naturally (without the need for atreadmill that might cause unwanted movementartefacts 24) and allows movement asymmetry to be quantied during all stages of the lamenessexamination, including the response to diagnosticanalgesia. 25-29 8. What About Bilateral Lameness? In the context of movement asymmetry measure-ments to aid lameness examinations, sooner or laterthe question arises: \"But what about the bilater-ally lame horse? It does not move asymmetrically.\"The answer to this question is two-fold: rst, asoutlined above, technology may pick up subtle move-ment asymmetries that can be hard to detect consis-tently by eye. Previous research shows that somebilaterally lame horses indeed show subtle move-ment asymmetries 30and some mild pre-existing asymmetries on the straight may be exacerbated onthe lunge. 31,32The second point, however, is more essential: in much the same way that horses areput on the lunge, flexion tests are being performedand diagnostic analgesia is administered and thenthe horse is observed by eye. These same tools(lunge, flexion tests, and diagnostic analgesia) stillexist when measuring movement asymmetry, 33 and the freedom of movement afforded by moderntechnology makes it easy to do this wherever thehorse may be. Hence, a near-symmetrical bilater-ally lame horse will then show changes in asymme-try measurements either on the lunge, after flexiontest, or after diagnostic analgesia. Having an ob-jective, quantitative measurement might contributeto limiting the \"expectation bias\" that can affectjudgment of intrahorse changes, e.g., after diagnos-tic analgesia. 34 9. Lameness Versus Movement Asymmetry A recent editorial has initiated discussion about thedenition of lameness and the impact of technolog-ical aids on that denition. 33Although there clearly are different opinions about this topic,5,35it appears important to gather further relevant infor-mation that can feed into the continued discussionand address topics, such as the variability of gait asymmetry measurements and its sources, 21,36the agreement with expert decision making,37in gen- eral, and for various applications and disciplines,and contemplating to what extent incorporating fur-ther measurements into the decision making processcould be useful. 38 10. More Than Head Nod and Hip Hike? An example of a recent advancement is the (re-)incorporation of withers movement into the mea-surement process. 39First investigated many years ago,14,40a recent study in horses with induced lame- ness has shown the potential benet of making useof withers movement asymmetry when differentiat-ing between a \"true\" head nod shown in a forelimblame horse and a \"compensatory\" head nod in reac-tion hindlimb pat- terns of in horses with naturally occurring gaitasymmetries 41and also in horses presented to vet- erinary specialist centers for lameness investiga-tions (Persson unpublished). a 11. Future Trends? Further miniaturization of sensor and wireless tech-nology combined with improvements in wirelessdata transmission and data storage capacity as wellas availability of cheaper sensor technology drivenby ubiquitous usage in smartphones, intelligent t-ness, and home management-related products willlikely lead to further development of the eld ofequine movement asymmetry assessment. De-creased costs will make technology available tomany more people in the equestrian eld. The pos-sibility to synchronize many sensors with little effortand transmit or log data will lead to tools that canmeasure additional anatomical areas of thehorse. 38Increasing the use of articial intelligence will lead to many more tools combining differentsensors. 290 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO MANAGE HOOF LAMENESS IAcknowledgments Thank you to all horse owners of horses participat- ing in our cited manuscripts, all collaborators onpast and current research grants, and The Horser-ace Betting Levy Board for continued support of avariety of horse-related research activities.

Introduction Farrier science has long been appreciated for its effectiveness against differing equine lamenesses.Basic biomechanical principles have been notedthroughout published literature since the beginningof farrier practice. 1As farrier ideals and concepts have matured, a hoof care provider's approach to theapplication of therapeutic shoeing may also need tobe reviewed to enable a more progressive approach to equine foot care. While there may be a correlation between aesthet- ically pleasing workmanship and functional shoe- ing, sometimes practitioners have to look furtherinto the foot when lameness enters the equation.Basic shoeing principles may fall short when pathol-ogy is cited in the distal limb. In many cases, at-tention to the smallest of details can mean thedifference between success or failure for the equineathlete and for the farrier. While the mature equine skeleton offers a robust, bony structure, the hoof capsule can adapt in vari-ous ways to accommodate loading pressure due to itsstructure and pliability. The structural integrity ofthe capsule can be altered by weight, conformation, moisture, and the horse's adaptation to pathology. 2 Therefore, a practitioner must consider the effec-tiveness and sustainability of the shoeing principles that are being employed during the shoeing process. Managing diagnosed pathology with the integra- tion of therapeutic shoeing can be effective, but alsohave a sense of fluidity. When dealing with equinepain, the lameness level can fluctuate in both apositive and negative direction over time. This canbe due to the progressive nature of certain lame-nesses or successful rehabilitation. To offer the horse the best possible prognosis, it can be benecial for both the farrier and veterinar- ian to meet to discuss cases. Gaining detailedinformation about each other's perspective can en-able a rehabilitation roadmap to incorporate theright components of both professions. Therapeu-tic shoeing can easily be contradictory if opposinghoof distortions, topical diseases, and pathologiesare present. Therefore, the use of diagnostic im-aging to appreciate the affected structures, cou- pled with a thorough examination of the hoofcapsule, can be the most streamlined approach toimplementing a well-thought-out shoeing pre-scription. Both practitioners should be aware ofthe capsule's ability to respond to changes thataccompany differing therapeutic shoeing modali-ties. Appreciation of this can be experienced inthe clinical lameness level changing, or visualized response to loading forces and hoof capsule adaptations. 2. Static Assessment Static evaluation is an invaluable tool in assessinglimb and hoof capsule abnormalities. The authortypically starts static evaluation of the horse dis-cussing the performance issues with the rider,owner, or trainer. Performance notes from therider can be benecial to the hoof care provider.Within this conversation, dialogue regarding train-ing tendencies and/or difculties can be discussed inrelation to shoe modications to offer support orenhancement of movement. Static evaluation can also include interpretation of imaging, historical shoeing, hoof quality, andfunctionality. 3. Hoof Function Hoof capsule landmarks have been noted in the lit-erature to reference the center of rotation, 3and the apex of the cofn bone. These reference points canbe used to assess balance and locomotive function. The hoof capsule can also be assessed in terms of robustness, correctness, and its ability to rejuvenatehorn in an even and balanced manner. While the concept of hoof capsule balance is im- portant in terms of locomotion efciency, the hoofcapsule's fundamental role of protection and dissi-pating large amounts of energy must be consideredto encourage healthy horn rejuvenation. Ensuringthe internal structures of the hoof are correctly stim-ulated and supported can be considered a primaryprinciple of hoof care practice. A variety of hoof balance principles are often as- sessed in a stationary position. The author regu-larly nds that high-level sport horses often fail tomeet these expectations and prefers to trim andshoe the horse based around balance principles thatinvolve dynamic movement. Shoe placement,when based around the center of rotation, can offera reliable means of limiting stress on the limb dur-ing locomotion. 4Once the foot is balanced in an anterior/posterior plane, the shoe can then be as-sessed into individual quadrants to assess shoe bal-ance. Ideally, the shoe would offer even supportunder the limb around the bordering margins of thecapsule. Shoe balance can offer the sport horsegreater limb stability under peak force loading dur-ing locomotion (Fig. 1). Due to the hoof capsule's pliability under the body weight of the horse during stance and locomotion,the capsule can become distorted and therefore in-efcient at dampening the vibrations causedthrough locomotion if not corrected at regular inter-vals. The hoof capsule has been well noted fordeformation in the heel region. 5Contracted, un- derslung, and crushed heel structures are some ofthe most common forms of heel region distortion.External hoof capsule distortions can often impactthe structure, health, and function of the relativeunderlying anatomical dermal layers. This dys-function is often one of the rst causes of concussion-based lameness. 5 The solar region of the hoof capsule is the primary interface between the distal limb and the groundsurface. 4The neuro-sensory capabilities of the hoof capsule are relayed to the horse's brain by wayof the outer hoof wall. This sensory feature canenable the horse to perceive ground undulations,load, and pain. Hoof mass is a key component of a structurally functional capsule. The use of hoof testers can al-low identication of sensitive areas across the cap-sule's solar surface, while also providing anindication of hoof mass or density. Without the use of diagnostic imaging to establish baseline sole metrics, a practitioner can use hooftesters to decipher hoof mass or density. Hooveswith high saturation levels or poor sole mass willdeform and create an unfavorable reaction almostimmediately against light hoof tester pressure.In the author's opinion, hooves that lack solid den-sity often acquire dysfunctional capsule distortionswith more ease than their counterparts with well-formed, functional foot quality. The frog can be used to help identify hoof capsule depth to assist basic balance guidelines. The cofn bones solar elevation\u2014the distance and angulation from the terminal arch to the distal/dor-sal border of the cofn bone\u2014can be a reliablemeans of assessing solar contour. 6To further elab- orate, trimming the frog to the live apex, the solarelevation of the capsule can be identied by measur-ing the distance and angulation of the horny solarsurface (Fig. 2). Fig. 1. Shoe balance can offer the sport horse greater limb stability under peak force loading during locomotion. 294 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO MANAGE HOOF LAMENESS IThis landmark can be fundamental to restoring function to the capsule. The author nds that once the solar contour is identied, often there is no needto remove any extra sole mass to otherwise gaintrimming landmarks (Fig. 3). This can allow the farrier the opportunity to leave more sole mass within the trim and gain furtherintegrity within the capsule. The hoof capsule's ability to perform can also be influenced by the interaction with bacteria, fungus,and environmental conditions. Hoof quality can benegatively affected by keratinophilic infections andalternating saturation levels. Neutralizing satura-tion levels with topical treatments can be an effec-tive means to avoiding not only hoof distortions butinfections that lay on the epidermal structures of thecapsule. 2Therefore, animal husbandry can posi- tively impact a standardized shoeing prescription. The assessment of skeletal conformational devia- tions can play a signicant role in understandingthe loading and enrollment patterns of each limb.Conformational misalignments may be repre- sented by way of hoof distortions or localized de-crease in foot quality or minimized proliferation ofhorn. The capsule's response to loading pressurecan also be seen in wall separations, crushed heels,and prolapsed frogs. Uneven dissipating force canbe responsible for some hoof capsule distortions. 4 In the author's experience, conformational mis- alignments can also be represented internally byasymmetric cofn bone architecture and this can beviewed radiographically. This relationship is prob-ably caused through uneven loading pressure overthe capsule, internal vascular compression, and thecofn bone's ability to demineralize and reabsorbbone (Fig. 4). To accurately dene the severity of common limb deviations, it can be benecial for the practitioner toalign himself in front of the horse's carpus duringthe viewing process to ensure a standardized andreliable means of observation. From this perspec-tive, the practitioner can assess the relevance of thehorse's age in relation to physis maturity or limb/hoof capsule-loading expectations. Common limbdeviations Conformationally, skeletal misalignments may re- quire the hoof care provider to make adjustments tothe shoe to help ease the loading and/or enrollmentphase. This can be made possible by way of shoeselection with differing break-over patterns or shoebranch modications. 4. Dynamic Assessment Initial dynamic evaluation can be considered an ex-tension of the static conformation assessment.The author will watch the horse move in straightlines on a hard surface that offers some reliabletraction for the horse. Observing the interaction of Fig. 2. Trimming the frog to the live apex, the solar elevation of the capsule can be identied by measuring the distance andangulation of the horny solar surface. Fig. 3. Once the solar contour is identied, often there is no needto remove any extra sole mass to otherwise gain trimminglandmarks. Fig. 4. Conformational misalignments can be represented inter-nally by asymmetric cofn bone architecture which can be viewedradiographically. This is probably caused through uneven load-ing pressure over the capsule, internal vascular compression, andthe cofn ability hoof capsule and initial ground contact during locomotion can offer valuable information to the ex-pectations of the limb in relation to medio-lateralbalance. Trying to view the nal milliseconds ofthe landing phase can offer the practitioner valuableinformation on how the horse is landing in a medio-lateral plane but also in an anterior/posteriorarrangement. Breaking the evaluation into 2 segments may al- low the practitioner a better observation of thehorse's movement and potential lameness. The thoracic limb is generally best observed when the equine is trotting directly toward the assessor.During this assessment, interference and landingpatterns of the front limbs can be noted. Lamenessmay be represented in asymmetric gait abnormali-ties, or the limb's axial or abaxial changes in limblanding and placement. The pelvic limb is best assessed when the horse is moving away. It is during this evaluation methodwhen hind-limb abnormalities are best represented.Conformational implications can be viewed alongwith lameness. Pelvic limb lameness, like otherlamenesses, can be subtle and multifaceted due tothe complex arrangement of the reciprocal appara-tus. Viewing hip movement, or fetlock descent mayoffer some initial insight to any potential affectedlimb. In addition to straight-line dynamic assessment, viewing the horse on a lunge line can offer insightinto lamenesses that occur while the horse is per-forming in a circular motion. It is also during thisphase of dynamic assessment that the horse may beviewed transitioning through lead changes. Abnor-malities to evaluate are reluctance to initiate leadsand dorso-cranial phases of stride. To supplement dynamic evaluation, palpation of the digital pulse, located at the fetlock, can offerinsight to potential inflammation. The horse's abil-ity to enhance blood flow to the digit can be a reliablemeans of locating which limb is affected if inflam-mation is present within the capsule. 5. The Application of Therapeutic Shoes The sustainability of a shoeing prescription must betaken into consideration when implementing anyshoeing concept. This aspect of therapeutic shoe-ing can be one of the most challenging aspects of footcare. Manipulation of the capsule can be detrimen-tal to the hoof capsule's structure, function, andperformance if the shoeing prescription challengesthe capsule's structural integrity. The center of pressure can have a signicant im- pact on the sustainability of a shoeing prescription. 4 The center of pressure's stationary landmark is typ-ically 3/8 inch back from the apex of the frog, andslightly axial in placement. The center of pressureis also transient in nature when the horse is inlocomotion due to the changing body mass above. While some shoe packages are well known for their effectiveness against certain lamenesses, con-sideration of the effect of the center of pressure movement must be assessed in order to ensure theshoeing prescription is sustainable. The center of pressure can affect a shoeing pre- scription in various ways. Pressure plate studieshave indicated that the center of pressure can bemanipulated through the use of graduated or wedgeshoes. 7While this aspect of hoof care can be appre- ciated in terms of anterior or posterior elevation,shoe modications that alter the medio-lateral land-ing patterns can also inherently manipulate thecenter of pressure. Therefore, asymmetric shoepatterns, when used in a deformable surface, mayaffect the center of pressure movement. Any shoeing prescription's effectiveness can alter when the capsule is elevated or suspended off theground for long periods without the recruitment ofother structures within the hoof capsule's solar sur-face. 4The capsule's ability to resist the mechanical redirection of pressure may need to be assessed on acase-by-case, breed-by-breed basis. While some horses will adapt to change well, others may, overtime, see a decline in overall foot health and quality.Indications of negative effects of the center of pres-sure shifts can include crushing of the heel struc-ture, deforming wall quality, or induced medio-lateral balance issues. Poor horn structure mayneed to be put into a load-sharing capacity to reducethe negative effects of center of pressure move-ments. Incorporating the sole and frog into a load-sharing capacity may help the hoof care provider toimplement therapeutic shoeing with less complica-tions over longer durations. When evaluating the sustainability of a shoeing prescription or concept, one must consider the entireshoeing period to offer a valid shoeing prescription.Horses that perform in a deformable substrate mayexperience the effects of asymmetric shoe shapes ina greater capacity depending on the depth of footing.In theory, while the asymmetrical shoe shape maybe transferring energy to opposing structures, itmay often also set up a passive anterior/posterior ormedio-lateral capsule imbalance. In cases where shoe modications are employed for soft-tissue injury, in the author's opinion, veter-inary diagnostics are needed to assist the therapeu-tic shoeing program. In cases of soft-tissue injury,repeated imaging can offer insight as to when toreduce or remove the therapeutic value of differingasymmetric shoe shapes. 6. Surface Conditions Track and arena surfaces can offer differingamounts of shock and slide reduction. Arena sur-faces can alter the slide phase of stride. 8While the ideal amount of slide upon landing is not yet quan-tied, the shoeing package must offer the necessaryamount of traction to allow rider safety and for thehorse to perform in a controlled manner. Shoe se-lection can be fundamental in offering the correct 296 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO MANAGE HOOF LAMENESS Iamount of traction for the horse, rider, and discipline. The level of pathology and shoe selection may need to be assessed in relation to the horse's work-load. While some therapeutic shoeing modalitiesoffer little traction but signicant therapeutic value,therapeutic be of themore difcult shoeing modalities to navigate due tothe necessity of traction. Retaining effective trac-tion in a shoeing prescription can be achieved byensuring concavity on the distal surface of the shoe-ing package. 4 Alternative methods of adding therapeutic value to a shoeing can include the use of temporary orthot-ics, bar shoes, or stabilizer pads that are welded orriveted into place. 7. Summary While historically the farrier's role in foot care hasbeen widely accepted as a means of maintenanceand capsule protection, it can also be a valid andeffective means of lameness management. New information in the form of force plate studies coupled with revised biomechanical principles hasseen a near revolution in farriery in the past decade.The review of these principles with attention to thehoof capsule's response to conformation, disease,and pathology may be the most effective means ofveterinary and farrier response to lameness. As an accompaniment to distal limb imaging and sports medicine, therapeutic shoeing can be an ef-fective means of addressing equine lameness, ensur-ing that the shoeing prescription is detailed, isessential to success. For farriers, the detection of the smallest of de- tails may contraindicate standardized approaches towidely accepted equine foot care. This element of farriery may be one of the dening aspects of thecraft. Therefore, the interpretation of the capsule'soverall health, integrity, and conformation shouldbe taken into consideration when therapeutic casesare presented or being reevaluated.

Introduction The purpose of this study was assess the efcacy and safety of ciclesonide, administered via a novelequine-specic non-pressurized inhaler a, in horses with severe equine asthma (sEA) under eldconditions. 2. Materials and Methods This is a prospective, multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blinded study. Two-hundred and twenty-four signs of sEA were randomized (1:1 ratio) toreceive an inhaled ciclesonide (343 /H9262g/actuation) so- lution or placebo (0 /H9262g/actuation) via the inhalerafor a total of 10 days, 8 actuations q12h for 5 days,followed by 12 actuations q24h for 5 days. Theprimary outcome was a success/failure analysis,with treatment success dened as a /H1135030% reductionin weighted clinical score between day 0 and day 10/H110061. Additionally, owner-perceived improve- ments in Quality of Life (QOL) were assessed atdays 5 /H110061 and 10 /H110061. 3. Results At day 10 /H110061, the treatment success rate was sig- nicantly (P /H110210.0001) greater in ciclesonide-treated horses (73.4% [80/109]) than in the placebo group (43.2% [48/111]). At day 5 /H110061 and day 10 QOL was signicantly ( horses and 69.3%, respec-tively) than in the placebo group (32.7% and 43.4%,respectively). The overall number of adverseevents (AEs) was low, with no serious AEs, and wasequally distributed between the groups. 298 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSMEDICINE: NON-INFECTIOUS DISEASES Research Abstract /L50093for more information, contact the corresponding author NOTES4. Discussion Despite the markedly superior clinical efcacy of ciclesonide relative to the placebo, a \"placebo effect\"was identied, which likely contributed in partto the clinical improvement observed in theciclesonide-treated group. Ciclesonide inhalationsolution administered by the inhaler awas well erated and effective at reducing clinical signs andimproving QOL in severely asthmatic horses.

Introduction This study was to evaluate the bronchoalveolar la- vage (BAL) fluid cytological results of barrel racinghorses with exercise-induced pulmonary hemor-rhage (EIPH), asthma, or both. 2. Materials and Methods A retrospective study was conducted of 95 horsesdiagnosed with noninfectious respiratory diseaseand BAL results at a private practice in Texas. 3. Results EIPH only was diagnosed in 28/95 (30%) BAL sam-ples, asthma only was diagnosed in 25/95 BALsamples, and EIPH and asthma was diagnosed in42/95 (44%) BAL samples. A history of EIPH wasnot predictive of a diagnosis of EIPH or asthma.Of the BAL results consistent with asthma only, theprimary elevated cell type was mast cell; followed bysamples with both elevated eosinophils and mastcells. No cytological differences in frequency of el-evated inflammatory cell types were found betweenhorses diagnosed with EIPH and those without adiagnosis of EIPH. 4. Discussion The study showed a substantial percentage (44%) ofthe horses examined had evidence of both EIPH andasthma on BAL cytologic evaluation. Comorbidi-ties of EIPH and asthma is a common diagnosis inbarrel racing horses in this study.

Introduction The authors were unaware of studies examining envi- ronmental exposures, neonatal dysphagia and athlet-icism. Foals born on the affected Pennsylvania (PA)farm and an unaffected New York (NY) farm owned bythe same proprietor were evaluated. Dams eitherspent their entire 11-month gestation on one farm ormoved to the other farm in late gestation. 2. Materials and Methods A comprehensive investigation of equine physiologicalparameters and environmental chemical exposures(2014-2016), and racing performance of foals born(2012-2017) on the PA and NY farms was performed. 3. Results Seventeen of 65 foals born (2014-2016) weredysphagic; all on the PA farm. Odds of dysphagiaincreased with the dam residing on the PA farm for each additional month of gestation. Colts weremore likely to be dysphagic. Prior to installation ofa ltration system, PA water concentrationsof 3,6-dimethylphenanthrene, fluoranthene, pyrene,and triphenylene exceeded and 13/18 dysphagic foals raced;47/67 normal NY raced. There were no differ-ences in the p ercentage to race, or earnings per start or speed indices between dysphagic and nor-mal foals. 4. Discussion Evidence showed an increased prevalence of dyspha-gia in foals born near unconventional natural gasdevelopment, which did not impact subsequent rac-ing performance.

Haffner, DVM*; Rhonda M. Hoffman, PhD, PAS, DACAN; PhD, DACVIM; Kayla N. and Greg L. Pearce Authors' address: Middle Tennessee State University Horse Science Center, stimulation of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has becomea method for diagnosis of pituitary parsintermedia dysfunction (PPID). 1When testing for PPID, factors to consider include repeatability oftesting during the year, 2time requirements for cen- trifugation after blood collection,3effects of stress on basal ACTH concentrations, the duration of efcacyof thawed TRH after it has been frozen for storage,and the stability of ACTH concentration after freez-ing. All of these factors potentially may affect testresults and were investigated to aid practitioners toobtain consistent reliable results when testing forPPID in horses. 2. Duration of Effectiveness of Frozen/Thawed TRH to Stimulate ACTH Release in Horses Introduction Many equine practitioners freeze single doses of TRH following removal of a single dose from a mul-tidose vial. Typically, prior to use, the TRH isthawed and taken to the farm to be used whentesting a potential PPID horse. If the horse owner declines testing, the veterinarian has TRH that hasbeen frozen and thawed. Anecdotally, TRH canonly be frozen and thawed once for an optimumand consistent response. The potency and stabilityover time of TRH after one freeze/thaw cycle is un-known. This study was designed to determine theduration of effectiveness of TRH in horses followingone freeze/thaw cycle when stored at 5\u00b0C over time. Materials and Methods The TRH stimulation test used in each of thesestudies was conducted as follows: blood was col-lected into a purple top tube afor basal ACTH (T0- ACTH) followed by IV administration of 1 mg TRHb (1 mL). Blood was then collected exactly 10 min-utes post-TRH administration (T10-ACTH). Bloodsamples were centrifuged and plasma at/H1100280\u00b0C until ACTH analysis using a chemilumines-cent immunoassay at the Animal Health DiagnosticLaboratory, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY. Deter-mination of positive, negative, and equivocal statusfor PPID was according to the 66 /H114082020 303MEDICINE: NON-INFECTIOUS DISEASES Group recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of PPID. Ten horses (PPID/H11001and PPID/H11002) were enrolled, mean age, 18.8 years (range, 12-25 years). Horseswere rst paired by PPID status and randomizedinto 2 groups of 5 horses (each group contained 4PPID /H11002and 1 PPID/H11001). Thirty 1-mg/mL doses of constituted TRH were frozen (/H1100220\u00b0C) 28 days priorto testing. Fourteen days prior to testing, ten dosesof TRH were thawed and kept at 5\u00b0C until admin-istration. The remaining 20 doses of TRH werethawed on the rst day of testing (Day 0) and storedat 5\u00b0C until administration. On Day 0, all horseswere TRH stimulation tested using TRH thawedsame day. The TRH stimulation procedure was re-peated post-thaw on Days 14, 28, 42, and 56. Inorder to avoid potential carryover effects of multipleTRH stimulation procedures administered every 2weeks, horses in Group 1 had the TRH stimulationrepeated on Days 14 and 42 (post-thaw TRH),whereas Group 2 horses had the TRH stimulationrepeated on Days 28 and 56 (post-thaw TRH). AllT10-ACTH were centrifuged following col-lection and plasma frozen ( /H1100280\u00b0C) until analysis at Cornell Animal Health Diagnostic Center. Datawere analyzed using a mixed model with repeatedmeasures to compare T10-ACTH and the percentincrease (T0-ACTH to T10-ACTH) of ACTH afterTRH stimulation, using horse as the subject andday as the repeated effect. Pearson's correlationcoefcients were used to examine relationships, andBland-Altman plots were constructed to compareT10-ACTH on Days 14, 28, 42, and 56 to the T10-ACTH on Day 0. Results There was no effect of Group ( P/H11022.25), so when appropriate, data were combined for analysis. Therewas no effect of day post-thaw on T10-ACTH ( P/H11005 .13) or the percent after TRH stimulation indicated relation-ships 0 and all otherdays (R /H110220.98, P/H11021.001). Bland-Altman plots indicated an average day bias of 9.4 pg/mL in allhorses compared to day 0, with 95% limits of agree-ment at /H1100238.8 to 57.4 pg/mL. Discussion In this study, the TRH stimulation procedure pro-duced repeatable ACTH concentrations in samplescollected 10 minutes after administration of TRH inhorses when using TRH that had been frozen,thawed, and stored at 5\u00b0C for up to 56 days. 3. The Effect of Trailering and Dentistry on Resting Adrenocorticotropic Hormone Concentration in Horses Introduction Several studies have concluded that pain, stress, and concurrent illness were only likely to affect di-agnostic usefulness of resting ACTH when severe.4 The objective of this study was to identify whethertrailering or teeth floating (common stressful situa-tions/procedures) increase plasma ACTH levels inhorses that might interfere with testing for PPID. Materials and Methods Twelve PPID-negative horses were randomized into3 groups of 4 horses per group. Each group wasrandomly assigned to an initial treatment: den-tistry (DN), trailered (TR), or stabled controls (CN).Following initial treatment, each horse group wasrandomly assigned to each of the two remainingtreatment groups; thereby, each horse group under-went all three treatments. Plasma was collectedfrom all horses prior to each treatment and used asthe baseline basal ACTH. The DN horses wereplaced in stocks, sedated with 0.1 to 0.3 mg/lb xyla-zine IV, and following mouth speculum placement,teeth were floated c. The TR group was loaded on a 6-horse slant trailer and hauled for 40 minutes.Immediately following the dental procedure andtrailer ride, post-procedure (P0) plasma sampleswere collected. Plasma samples were then col-lected from all horses at 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutespost-procedure. Plasma P0 samples from the CNhorses were taken when the TR h orses returned. Plasma samples were frozen ( /H1100280\u00b0C) until analysis at Cornell Animal Health Diagnostic Center. Datawere conrmed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk statistic, and then analyzed using a mixedmodel with repeated measures (i.e., each horse as itsown control), with main effects of treatment (CN,DN, TR) and time, and day /H11003time as the repeated effect. Statistical signicance was designated atP/H11021.05. Data were summarized as mean /H11006SE. Results No change occurred in ACTH over time in the CNor DN horses (P /H11005.14). ACTH was higher in TR compared to CN (P /H11005.026) and DN (P /H11005.016) horses. In TR horses, ACTH was higher than base-line (PRE) immediately after trailering (T0; P/H11005 .0003). By 30 minutes post-trailering, as were no differences in mean basal ACTH com-pared to PRE concentrations ( P/H11005.55). One horse in the study maintained elevated ACTH concentra-tions until the 120-minute time point. No signicant difference in resting ACTH concen- trations over time was observed in horses undergo-ing dentistry procedures compared to baseline.A 40-minute trailer ride resulted in signicantlyincreased basal ACTH concentrations in horses upto 30 minutes post-unloading. Discussion In these horses, collecting blood within 30 minutes(in all horses) and up to 120 minutes (in one horse)after trailering resulted in elevated resting ACTHconcentrations that could interfere with PPID test-ing. Based on results of this study, blood should 304 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSMEDICINE: NON-INFECTIOUS DISEASESnot be collected for resting ACTH concentration de- termination for at least 30 minutes after trailering. 4. TRH Repeatability in PPID-Negative and PPID-Positive Horses Introduction Even though TRH stimulation of ACTH has been used as a diagnostic test for equine PPID, it is un-known whether the T10-ACTH response to TRH isrepeatable in individual horses. The purpose ofthis study was to conduct TRH stimulation tests at4-week intervals, beginning in February and endingin June, in horses with and without PPID to deter-mine the repeatability of the T10-ACTH, over time. Materials and Methods Twelve horses, 5 PPID positive (PPID/H11001), 5 PPID negative (PPID-), and 2 PPID equivocal with a mean age of 18.8 years (range, 12 to 25 years) were en-rolled. Basal ACTH concentration from blood col-lected in January was used to identify PPID statusof each horse. The TRH stimulation procedure wasperformed on day 0 (February 13) and repeated onDays 28, 56, 84, and 112. The subsequent sampleswere compared to the T10-ACTH samples collectedon Day 0. Data were conrmed for normality usingthe Shapiro-Wilk statistic, and then analyzed usinga mixed model with repeated measures to compareT10-ACTH and the percent increase of ACTH afterTRH stimulation, using horse as the subject and dayas the repeated effect. Pearson's correlation coef-cients were used to examine relationships betweenT10-ACTH on days 28, 56, 84, and 112 to T10-ACTHon day 0. Bland-Altman plots were constructed tocompare T10-ACTH on Days 28, 56, 84, and 112 tothe T10-ACTH on Day 0. Results The mean basal ACTH increase in T10- ACTH after TRH stimulation. Repeated measures analysis indicated no effect of day on T10-ACTH(P/H11005.40), or the percent increase of T10-ACTH after TRH stimulation (P /H11005.12). Pearson's correlation coefcients indicated strong relationships betweenT10-ACTH on Day 0 and all other days (R /H110220.70, P/H11021.01). Bland-Altman plots indicated an average day bias of 27 pg/mL in all horses compared to day 0,with a day bias of 10 pg/mL in PPID -(with 95% limits of agreement at 122 pg/mL) and 43 pg/mL in PPID/H11001(with 95% limits of The Immulite intra-assay CV for most of theobserved day bias.Discussion The TRH stimulation procedure produced repeat- able ACTH concentrations in samples collected 10minutes after administration of TRH in horses col-lected at 4-week intervals over 112 days from Feb-ruary through June. Observed variation of T10ACTH over the duration of the study resulted in 2/5PPID negative horses classied as positive, once andtwice, respectively. Additionally, the T10 ACTHin 1/5 PPID positive horses tested equivocal at onetime point. The results of this study stress theimportance of using the combination of owner his-tory, clinical signs, and laboratory data when deter-mining the proper diagnosis of PPID. 5. Effect of Delayed Plasma Centrifugation on Equine ACTH Concentration Introduction If stored at room temperature (21\u00b0C), ACTH level in blood decreased soon after collection.6Multiple recommendations exist for the timing of centrifuga-tion of chilled samples from sample collection. Inthe United States, a discordance exists between lab-oratory recommendations concerning centrifugationtime from sample collection. Realistically, manyequine ambulatory practitioners do not have theability to centrifuge the sample within 2 to 4 hours.This study was conducted in order to determine thelength of time whole blood can be stored refrigeratedprior to centrifugation and maintain accurate ACTHconcentration. Materials and Methods On day 0, 5 mL of whole blood from each of 10 horse(Five PPID positive and 5 PPID negative) was col-lected into each of 6 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid(EDTA) tubes and immediately placed in a refriger-ator at 7\u00b0C. One tube from each horse was centri-fuged within 15 minutes of collection, followed bycentrifugation of one tube from each horse at 4, 8,12, 24, and 36 hours following collection. At eachtime, centrifuged plasma was pipetted into 1.5 mLpolypropylene tubes and stored at -80\u00b0C. None ofthe plasma samples were turbid, hemolyzed, or ic-teric. Plasma was shipped frozen with cold packsovernight to the Animal Health Diagnostic Center ofCornell University in Ithaca, NY for an alysis. The percent change from baseline (PCFB) was re- ported to standardize the data given that baselinevalues differed. Results The absolute changes over time revealed no patternof variation. The mean PCFB was 2.8% 7.0%). There evidence time effect from the repeated measuresmodel with a P-value of .5056. There was no evi- dence of signicant time effect on the level of ACTHin PPID positive or PPID negative horses. Three of10 enrolled horses exhibited variation AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 305MEDICINE: NON-INFECTIOUS DISEASESconcentration at 1 time point that changed the diagnostic interpretation of PPID status from PPIDnegative to equivocal, PPID positive to equivocaland PPID negative to equivocal, respectively. In 2of the 3 horses, the variation was less than theintra-assay variability (9.3%) whereas the ACTHwas increased 16.7% in the third horse. Discussion This work demonstrated that refrigeration (4\u00b0C) ofwhole blood for up to 36 hours prior to centrifuga-tion and freezing did not signicantly affect plasmaACTH concentrations. Laboratory diagnostic re-sults alone should not be utilized to classify a horseas PPID positive or negative. The history and clin-ical signs in conjunction with laboratory diagnosticresults should always be utilized for the diagnosis ofPPID. 6. Effect of Various Freezing Protocols on ACTH Plasma Concentration Introduction ACTH has been reportedly understood to be fragile in whole blood samples and is affected by heat andtime spent on erythrocytes prior to centrifugation. 7,8 Equine ACTH has been shown to be stable withoutcentrifugation for up to 8 hours stored at 21\u00b0C or4\u00b0C 6and was stable in plasma stored at /H1100220\u00b0C and /H1100280\u00b0C for 30 days.6If plasma samples cannot be shipped the day of collection to the respective labo-ratory, plasma should be frozen until shipment. It is imperative for the veterinarians to understandif freezing plasma has any negative effects on thestability of equine basal ACTH concentration. Theobjective of the study was to determine the stabilityof ACTH in plasma after freezing for differentlengths of time prior to determination of basalACTH concentration. Materials and Methods Twelve horses (5 mares, 6 geldings, and 1 stallion)ranging in age from 14 to 29 years from the MiddleTennessee State University herd were screened forACTH in May with levels found to range from 12.4pg/mL 62.0 pg/mL mg of TRH asuspended in 1 mL of saline was administered intravenously to the same 12 horses.Ten minutes later, blood samples were collected inEDTA tubes and refrigerated at 5\u00b0C until centri-fuged at 1000/H11003g for 10 minutes within 2 hours of collection. Plasma was stored in microcentrifugetubes and frozen for variable lengths of time andconditions. Basal ACTH concentrations were mea-sured at day 0. Plasma samples were stored at/H1100280\u00b0C for 3, 7, 30, 60, and 90 days, or stored at/H1100220\u00b0C for 3, 7, 30, and 60 days, or stored between icepacks in a freezer to mitigate fluctuation of temper-ature due to opening and closing of the freezer doorat/H1100220\u00b0C for 3 and 7 days prior to determination ofbasal ACTH concentration. Plasma was shippedfrozen with cold packs overnight to the AnimalHealth Diagnostic Center, Cornell University, Ithaca,NY. Samples were batch analyzed for plasmaACTH concentration determined by chemilumines-cent immunoassay previously validated for horses.ACTH concentrations were compared to baseline(non-frozen day 0 plasma) for each storage methodusing a mixed model with repeated measures inwhich each horse served as its own control and daywas the repeated effect. Statistical signicancewas set at P/H11349.05. Results Mean basal ACTH concentration on day 0 392.2 pg/mL by 90 ( P/H11005 .047). Through day 60, the PCFB never variedmore than 2% and was not different ( P/H11022.62) from day 0. On day 90, the PCFB was /H110026.9% and dif- ferent from baseline (P /H11005.030). Across the 90-day storage, degradation was observed ( P/H11005 .034). Mean basal ACTH concentration on day 0 at 392.2 pg/mL that de- by day 60. The ACTHconcentrations at day 0 and day 60 were not differ-ent (P /H11005.18). The PCFB was lower by day 60 ( P/H11005 .035). Across the 60-day storage, degradation wasobserved at /H1100220\u00b0C (P /H11005.004). Mean basal ACTH concentration at day 0 for plasma stored between ice packs at /H1100220\u00b0C was 392.2 pg/mL that declined 1.1% degradation of basal ACTH was day 7 in either the ACTH concentrations ( P/H11022.36) or the PCFB (P /H11022.24). Discussion In a practice situation, it is unlikely that sampleswould be held for more than just a few days. Thiswork shows that keeping frozen plasma stored inan ordinary household refrigerator freezer withoutkeeping it between ice packs to reduce temperaturefluctuation is sufcient to preserve testing reliabil-ity. For research or epidemiologic purposes, itshould be considered that after 60 days ACTH levelsdeclined when stored at /H1100280\u00b0C. 7. Conclusions TRH that has been frozen and thawed (once) waseffective for at least 56 days when TRH was keptrefrigerated after thawing. Trailering horses for 40minutes increased basal ACTH for at least 30 min-utes (and up to 120 minutes in one horse) post traile-ring. Results of T10 ACTH from TRH stimulationtesting was repeatable from January through earlyJune in the United States (Latitude 35\u00b0 50 /H1103244\" North). Basal ACTH concentration determinationis reliable from whole blood that has been refriger-ated for up to 36 hours prior to centrifugation.Plasma samples for ACTH determination can be 306 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSMEDICINE: NON-INFECTIOUS DISEASESfrozen in a refrigerator freezer at /H1100220\u00b0C, for up to 30 days or up to 60 days at /H1100280\u00b0C with no decrease in ACTH concentration.

Acid-suppressive therapy the cornerstone for treatment of equine gastric ulcer syndrome.1 The efcacy of oral formulations for the treatment of equine squamous gastric disease is well docu-mented, 2-4although it has been demonstrated that monotherapy with oral omeprazole is lessefcacious for the treatment of equine glandulargastric disease (EGGD). 5-7However, a recent study with a long-acting, injectable formulation ofomeprazole reported high healing rates for EGGDwith acid suppression alone. 8This reinforces the need to optimize the efcacy of oral omeprazole forthe treatment of both equine squamous gastricdisease and EGGD. However, despite its wide-spread use, until recently little attention has beengiven to the factors that affect efcacy of oralomeprazole. The purpose of this article is to dis-cuss these factors with specic focus on the rolethat diet, feeding, and administration of concur-rent medications play. The review is based onthe published, peer-reviewed literature. 2. Materials and Methods Feeding has signicant impact on both the bioavail-ability and acid-suppressive capacity of oral omepra-zole. When compared with administration on an empty stomach, the feeding of ad-libitum hay re- duces the bioavailability of oral 66%. re- flected in a decreased acid-suppressive capacity suchthat the average percentage of time each day thatthe pH exceeds 4 within the ventral stomach wasless than 40% in one study, even at a dose of 4 mg/kgPO q24h. 12Although the benchmark for healing in horses is not known, in humans the percentage timethat pH should exceed 3 or 4 is 66% for glandularand squamous disease, respectively, 13meaning that the average effect achieved under ad-libitum feed- ing conditions in horses is likely to be subtherapeu-tic in many animals. Further, in the groupreceiving ad-libitum hay, minimal, if any acid sup- pression was observed over a 5-day period in 3/6 animals at the same dose. 12 The timing of feeding is also important in maxi- mizing oral omeprazole's efcacy. Horses are con-sidered constant acid secretors, but there is asignicant prandial component to the pattern of gas-trin release. 14Proton pump inhibitors are pro- drugs that require the parietal cell to be activatedfor the prodrug to be converted to its active form, 308 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSMEDICINE: NON-INFECTIOUS DISEASES NOTESand thus to inhibit acid secretion. Coinciding the timing of feeding, and as such peak gastrin concen-tration, with peak plasma drug concentrations isexpected to maximize the number of proton pumpsinhibited with any given dose. Maximal serumconcentration occurs at around 45 to 90 min-utes 10,11,15,16and it is important that feeding occurs within this period. Lastly, the type of meal may be important. Gas- tric distention plays a role in gastrin release withlarger amounts of gastrin released more rapidly inresponse to voluminous, roughage-based mealswhen compared with smaller grain meals. 14 3. Results Combining the effects of overnight fasting, the tim-ing of feeding, and the type of feed given, the authorrecommends the following approach to optimizingthe efcacy of oral omeprazole: 17 Withhold feed from 10:00 pm the evening be-fore (or limit evening feeding such that theevening meal is consumed by 10:00 pm). Administer omeprazole orally at 6:00 to 7:00am. Feed 60 to 90 minutes later. The feed at thistime should consist of 1 to 2 large flakes ofalfalfa hay or a highly palatable roughage sub-stitute, followed by concentrate feeding (ifnecessary). The impact of concurrent administration of othermedications should also be considered. In otherspecies, sucralfate has been shown to decrease thebioavailability of omeprazole. As such, sucralfateshould not be given at the same time as omeprazole.Instead, the timing of its administration should bealongside the morning and evening feed-ing. Lastly, other acid suppressive drugs such asranitidine (and other H 2-receptor antagonists), or misoprostol (a parietal cell PGE2-receptor agonist), should not be administered concurrently as theyreduce activation of the proton pump and, in turn,decrease the rate of conversion of the omeprazoleprodrug to its active form. If drugs such as miso-prostol are going to be administered concurrently,then timing should be offset similarly to the admin-istration of sucralfate. 4. Discussion The technique described above is relatively easilyimplemented in many stables where horses are nor-mally stalled overnight. The main drawback of theapproach is the negative perception of owners ofhaving the horse off feed overnight, particularly be-cause the ad-libitum provision of feed has been con- sidered a cornerstone of equine gastric ulcersyndrome prevention for many years. However,the author views this approach as one that rein-forces the natural behavioral tendency for horses tofast overnight, 18,19and one that simply ensures thatdrug administration occurs prior to the horse eatingin the morning. It is also important to considerthat, although the horse is not eating for 8 to 10hours overnight, the stomach is only empty for arelatively short part of this period. Importantly,the advantage of the above approach is to maximizeabsorption and efcacy of oral omeprazole, which inturn is expected to optimize its efcacy. 5. Conclusion The enforcement of small management changes dur-ing the treatment period with oral omeprazole canresult in signicantly longer durations of intra-dayacid suppression, and in turn optimize the efcacy oforal omeprazole. Further, an awareness of the po-tential for drug-drug interactions can also optimizethe likelihood of a positive therapeutic outcome.

Introduction Transfusions in equine medicine are a relatively rare occurrence when compared to their usage insmall animals or humans. The volume of bloodproduct required, availability, potential reactions, and cost are all factors for their limited use. De-spite these constraints, a transfusion can be a life-saving procedure that can be accomplished in theeld with some forethought. While this topic hasbeen described previously, there are some new andvery important updates that must be consideredwhen deciding on donor h orses. In addition, fur- ther research has altered our understanding oftransfusion reactions and transfused red blood cellsurvival times. Goals of Transfusions The goals of a blood product transfusion usually fallwithin one of four categories in horses: 1. To improve oxygen delivery to tissues2. To provide immunoglobulins3. To provide oncotic support4. To provide clotting factors Some of most common reasons for a whole bloodtransfusion are as follows:Adult laceration\u2014Internal\u2014fractured rib, internal organtrauma Triggers for Whole-Blood Transfusion Therapy When deciding whether a patient requires a trans-fusion, it is important to evaluate the entire patientin addition to any laboratory data. It may be obvi-ous in a patient with severe acute blood loss who isshowing signs of cardiovascular shock, but a patientwith a more chronic condition may be signicantlymore difcult to assess. Assessment of heart rate,respiratory rate, DISEASES degree of pain will assist in de- termining the need for a whole-blood transfusion.1 In cases of anemia, there are many hematological parameters that can be measured to help determinethe need for a transfusion including packed cell vol-ume protein (TP), that PCV and TP will not assist in determiningthe need for a transfusion in acute blood loss as thevalues will remain with reference range for up to 24hours or until fluid therapy is commenced. Serialmonitoring of PCV and TP can provide valuableinformation on the patient and thus in conjunctionwith clinical appearance of the horse determine theneed for a transfusion. In many acute hemorrhagecases, a decrease in TP will precede the drop inPCV. 2Clinical signs are usually not seen in horses with acute anemia until the PCV drops below 20%,while chronic cases of anemia may not show signsuntil the PCV is approximately 12%. L actate con- centration will rise with decreased oxygen deliv-ery to tissues and values greater than 4 mmol/L after crystalloid fluid resuscitation may indicate theneed for a transfusion assuming the horse does nothave any other conditions which could lead to hy-perlactatemia (i.e., colic). Point of care lactate me-ters are inexpensive ( /H11021$350) and easy to use, thereby increasing the ability of many ambulatorypractitioners to use this stall-side test. A handheldstall provide lactate, hemoglobin, PvO2, Hct, and anion gap, although the device is cost prohibitive to most non-referral practices. If stall-side laboratory testing is not available, the practi-tioner will need to rely on clinical signs of pooroxygen delivery, specically tachycardia, tachypnea,and peripheral perfusion. 2.

Check to ensure donor PCV/TP is adequate for donation and meets all donor guidelines (seeResults section). 2. Prepare collection bags with appropriate amount of anticoagulant. a. A 1:9 ratio is used (ACD:blood) this works out to adding approximately 100 mL ofACD to each 1-L bag or 400 mL to a 4-L bag. b. Ensure that all the lines have been coated with the anticoagulant also to prevent clotsfrom forming in the lines during collection. 3. The horse's mane should be braided or taped out of the way to ensure it will not contami-nate your catheter site or your hands duringthe procedure.Table 1.

This will drastically improve your ability to insert the large bore catheter by reducingskin drag. 8. Perform another sterile skin preparation to the entire shaved area. 9. Don sterile gloves. 10. Place the 10-gauge catheter into the jugular vein aligning the catheter up the jugular(pointing to the head). 11. With this large bore catheter, it is sometimes easier to place the catheter all the way into thevein with the stylet seated in the catheter(instead of pushing the catheter off the stylet). a. By placing the catheter opposite to normal downward placement, gravity will assist inflow and increase collection speed. b. If blood flow is slow, the catheter should be replaced as it may be against the side of thevessel or on a blood valve. A normal 30-minute blood collection may end up takinghours if the flow is impeded. 12. Secure catheter to neck by suture ties or tape (Fig. 1).13. Aseptically, connect the catheter to the collec- tion tubing and bag. 14. Hold off the jugular vein below the cathe- ter. This must be continually held throughoutthe collection. a. A leftover cardboard roll from self-adhesive bandage rolls can be placed in the jugulargrove and rmly taped to the neck withwhite tape to occlude the jugular and re-duce the need for personnel to maintainocclusion. 15. Place the collection bag as low as possible to allow gravity flow of blood and unclamp the col-lection tube to start the collection (Fig. 2). 16. Gently rock the collection bag as blood is col- lected to gently mix the anticoagulant and theblood. a. If mixed too vigorously, the red cells may be damaged, and the quality of blood will bemarkedly reduced. 17. Throughout the blood collection, donor mu- cous membrane color, capillary rell time,heart rate, respiratory rate, peripheral ex-tremity temperature should be monitored. 18. Once the bag is lled (weighing the bag is the most accurate method of determining the vol-ume of blood in the bag), clamp the lines en-suring that no air enters the bag. 19. A maximum of 20% of blood volume can be collected at one time from a donor horse. a. Example: Blood volume (body weight 500 kg/H110038%)/H1100320%/H110058L . Fig. 1.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 315MEDICINE: NON-INFECTIOUS DISEASESAdditional Notes on Blood Collection Blood transfusions should be treated as an aseptic procedure and all materials should be handledappropriately. Having access to a hay net or feed during the collection process can reduce boredom and improvecompliance. If necessary, light sedation can beused. Administration of crystalloid fluids to the do-nor is recommended if the maximum blood with-drawal has been performed. Five to 10 L oflactated Ringer's solution is usually given when 8 to10 L of blood have been collected. The fluids can beadministered through the collection catheter afterthe procedure is completed or during the blood col-lection through a second intravenous catheter. Administration of Transfusions Whole-Blood Volume The volume of blood transfusion required can be calculated using various formula; however, in mostcases it is impractical to collect and administermore than 8 to 10 L at one time. The volume ad-ministered should reflect the patient status and re-sponse to the blood transfusion. If the patient is inhypotensive shock, it is key to provide your patientwith resuscitation fluids to improve peripheral per-fusion and cardiac output prior to commencing the blood transfusion. 2,3It is also important to discuss with the owner that administration of intravenousfluids (either crystalloids, colloid, or whole blood)will increase peripheral blood pressure and may in-crease bleeding (thereby worsening the patient'scondition); however, lack of fluid therapy will causehypoxemic damage to tissues and organs. As a general guide, whole blood is administered at a rate of 20 mL/kg. Usually 30% to 40% of the blood decit is corrected with a single transfusion.If you like to do math, you can also calculate thefollowing: The blood decit can be determined using the Blood Deficit/H11005(desired PCV /H11002current PCV) desired PCV /H110030.08/H11003body Or you can use the following formula: Litres of whole blood needed /H11005Desired PCV /H11002(recipient PCV /H110030.08/H11003body weight (kg)) Donor PCV Transfusion Rates of Administration The rate of administration of a transfusion is bestdescribed as \"the rate that is best for your patient.\"If the patient is in hemodynamic shock and will diewithout the immediate transfusion administration,then administering the transfusion as fast as possi-ble is the ideal rate in an emergency. If the patienthas been stabilized (even partially) then the admin-istration should start slower to allow for time toidentify potential transfusion reactions. In mostcases, it will be very difcult to reach the upperrange of the administration rates as most availableblood administration sets have narrow bore tubingand slow flow through the in-line lter. Do not run a transfusion without the use of an in-lineblood lter as clots and brin from the blood prod- uct can cause fatal outcomes (Fig. 3). It is very important that the blood transfusion be completed within 4 to 6 hours as the risk of bacterialcontamination of the product is much higher afterbeing left at room temperature for this amount oftime. Whole blood should not be administered coldand proper warming (if refrigerated) needs to bedone very gradually to reduce damage to cells and/orproteins in the product. Whole-Blood Administration (Fig. 4) Start at 0.1 mL/kg over at least 10 to 15 minutes Start at 1 drop every 1 to 2 seconds in a 500-kghorse with a 20 drop/mL administration set Gradually increase the rate over the next 20minutes Continue at 10 to 20 mL/kg/hour until completed Essentially a very fast drip in a foal or fullopen administration in adults with a 20drop/mL administration set 3. Results Blood Donors In the ideal situation, a blood donor horse will be blood typed and identied as Aa, Ca, and Qa nega- Fig. 3.

If this is not possible, the donor should be a healthy male horsewith no history of previous blood product adminis-tration (including whole blood, serum, plasma, anti-toxins, etc.). Alternatively, a maiden mare can beused with the same criteria. The donor horseshould be at least 450 kg, negative for equine infec-tious anemia (EIA), equine viral arteritis (EVA),be Qa and Aa antigens, making good donorcandidates. Recent Primate Hepacivirus)as possible causes of the highly fatal condition.It is therefore strongly recommended that all blooddonors are tested for viremia prior to blood collectionto reduce the risk of equine serum hepatitis in re-cipients. 4-6While not possible in emergency situ- ations, potential clinic donors should be screenedand a commercially available test for viruses asso-ciated with equine serum hepatitis is now available f. When considering commercial blood products, thecenter for veterinary biologics notice No. 19-03 in-dicates that \"All horses used as animals forthe manufacture of APHIS -regulated antibody, an-titoxin, serum, and plasma products must for the presence of equine parvovirus-hepatitis inblood samples.\"Blood Typing and Cross Matching Blood typing and cross matching are an importantpart of ensuring safe transfusion; however, commer-cial laboratory cross matching may take up to 24hours and blood type results can take up to 3 weeks.Currently, a commercial stall side major /H11006minor crossmatch gel column agglutination test is avail-able for horses which can be completed in less than20 minutes g. A recent study found fair agreement that was blood type dependent, between this majorcrossmatch test and reference standard methods inhorses. 7A second study used a modied canine rapid gel assay which if commercialize may also be auseful alternative test for stall side testing. 8A stall-side blood type immunochromatographic striptest is available for Ca blood types h; however, the more important Qa and Aa blood types strip testshave yet to be released. 9 In an emergency scenario, the delay of laboratory test results is impractical, and most transfusions aredone without compatibility results. Fortunately,most horses do not have pre-formed alloantibodies(pre-existing antibiotics against red blood cell (RBC)antigens). 2Mares who have given birth or horses that have had previous transfusion of blood products(including plasma) are at higher risk of a transfu-sion reaction. Blood typing and testing for alloantibodies is rec- ommended for any potential clinic donors to identifypossible horses to be used in emergency situations. Cross matching both major (recipient plasma to donor RBC) and minor (donor plasma to recipientRBC) is recommended if a blood transfusion is an-ticipated. For example, in cases of ongoing hemor-rhage, when a horse might require a second transfusion, or if the horse has a planned surgicalprocedure which may result in severe bleeding.It is important that the laboratory cross match pro-cedure identies both hemolysis and agglutinationincompatibilities. A cross match is also recom-mended if a horse requires repeated transfusions asalloantibodies can be produced in horses in less than7 days. 10 4. Discussion Monitoring During a transfusion, the patient should be moni- tored very closely for any signs of a transfusionreaction. It is recommended to assess the patientevery 5 to 10 minutes for the rst 30 minutes of thetransfusion then every 15 to 30 minutes until thetransfusion is completed. A mon itoring form will assist in identifying any trends in parameters andis an important piece of the medical record. Ateach assessment, the horse should have the heartrate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature, mucousmembranes, and attitude recorded. Monitoringshould also assess for the presence of any skinreactions (urticaria), agitation, tremors, or signsof anaphylaxis. Fig. 4. A horse receiving a blood transfusion. It is important that the blood transfusion be completed within 4 to 6 hours toreduce the risk of bacterial contamination of the blood product. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 317MEDICINE: NON-INFECTIOUS DISEASESTransfusion Reactions In horses, plasma transfusion reactions have been reported in 10% of foal transfusion cases and 0% to10% of adult transfusion cases, 11,12whereas a rate of 16% of adult horses receiving whole blood had atransfusion reaction with 3 of 44 transfusions beinglife threatening or fatal. 1Transfusion reactions can be categorized into hemolytic and non-hemolyticreactions. Hemolytic reactions result in hemolysisof RBCs and can be acute as a consequence of pre-formed alloantibodies or delayed through rapid pro-duction of antibodies. Unfortunately, there are nospecic treatments for hemolytic reactions only sup-portive therapies, therefore, it is best to preventpossible reactions through cross matching or bloodtyping. Recently, it has been shown that trans-fused red blood cells survive longer in circulation(T 12, 33.5 days) than previously thought and that the incompatible cross matched transfusions have adrastically decreased RBC survival in the donor(T 12, 4.7 days).13Evidence of a hemolytic reaction include signs of worsening cardiovascular shock(tachycardia, tachypnea), fever, restlessness, hemo-globinemia, hemoglobinuria, and worsening anemiafollowing the transfusion. The delayed immune-mediated hemolysis may be seen up to 3 to 5 days after transfusion. Non-hemolytic reactions include volume overload, bacterial contamination, microembolization, electro-lyte imbalances, fever, allergic/anaphylaxis, andTheiler's disease (equine serum hepatitis). not appear to be a specic protection from non-hemolytic reactions in cross match compatible bloodtransfusion in the literature. 14 If signs of a transfusion reaction are noted, stop the transfusion and perform a complete evaluationof the horse. If the reaction is mild and there is nosign of hemolysis or bacterial contamination of theblood product (i.e., concerns over asepsis or time atroom temperature), the transfusion can be restartedat a slow rate and the patient monitored closely asthe rate is once again gradually increased. If allergic or anaphylaxis reactions are observed, the transfusion should be stopped and the patientmay be treated with anti-inflammatories, antihista-mines, or epinephrine depending on the severity ofthe reaction (Table 1). The efcacy of anti-histamines in h orses is generally poor; however, the author has had some success with hy-droxyzine. Horses may become agitated after ad-ministration of an anti-histamine, especiallydiphenhydramine, and should thus be avoided in aseverely compromised patient. Again, with mildreactions the transfusion may be restarted at a slowrate after administration of the appropriate medica-tions and the patient monitored closely as the rate isonce again gradually increased (Fig. 5). For moresevere reactions, a new blood donor may be required. Donor information, commercial product lot num- bers, and details of the transfusions including allmonitoring sheets should be included in the medical record. This information can be invaluable if thehorse requires another transfusion or has a transfu-sion reaction.

Introduction There are many horses that appear sound in hand but have underlying pain-related musculoskeletalproblems when ridden. However, horses show avariety of gait modications in an attempt to reducepain and minimize lameness, including reducing therange of motion of the thoracolumbosacral region, 1 taking shorter steps, altering limb flight, and in-creasing body lean. 2Owners, riders, and trainers may not be able to recognize the signs of lameness.In a study of 506 sports horses in normal work andpresumed to be sound, 47% were overtly lame or had other pain-related gait abnormalities (e.g., stiff andstilted canter). 3In an unrelated study of 201 rid- ing horses in full work and functioning normally,53% had gait asymmetry when evaluated trotting inhand, which was determined using inertial mea-surement units. 4An analysis of 57 dressage and showjumping horses in normal work revealed that65% exhibited lameness either in hand on the lungeor ridden; 47% showed lameness ridden and 7%were only lame ridden. 5Riders and trainers oftenlabel performance problems experienced during rid- den exercise as training-related, rider-related, orbehavioral or 'that is just how the horse has alwaysgone. 6,7Consequently pain-related problems often get insidiously but progressively worse. The inabil-ity to perform satisfactorily may result in a declinein the value of the horse and the standards of care. 6 Improved pain recognition will enhance equinewelfare. Many veterinarians have had little training in pain recognition and limited education in identica-tion of low -grade lameness, especially in ridden horses and, therefore, struggle to recognize muscu-loskeletal pain as a cause of poor performance.Owners are frustrated when they think that theirhorse has an underlying pain-related problem butare informed by their veterinarian that there is nodetectable lameness and the problem must be be-havioral. It would, therefore, be useful to have ad-ditional tools for owners, trainers, veterinarians, and other paraprofessionals to recognize signs ofmusculoskeletal pain. 334 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIMAGING AND REHABILITATION NOTESBehavioral changes related to experimentally induced orthopedic pain in horses have been de- scribed,8,9but the features described, such as paw- ing the ground, are generally not applicable toridden horses. The most recent advance in the rec-ognition of subtle behavioral changes associatedwith pain is the investigation of facial expressions. 10 The spectrum of facial expressions exhibited by nor-mal horses under non-ridden circumstances hasbeen described in detail. 11An \"equine pain face\" was developed to describe facial features of horseswith induced limb pain at rest. 12A Horse Grimace Scale, consisting of six features (\"the ears held stifflybackwards; orbital tightening [the eyelids are par-tially or completely closed]; tension above the eye;the mouth strained with a pronounced chin; thenostrils strained with flattening of their prole; andprominent strained chewing muscles\") was devel-oped to categorize the facial expressions of horses undergoing routine castration, with or withoutperioperative analgesia. 13However, it has been suggested that posture changes and overall bodytension in resting horses may confound results andthat further research is required to test for relia-bility of \"pain grimace\" measures. 14The Equine Utrecht University Scale for Facial Assessment ofPain was developed to assess facial pain expressionsin horses with or without abdominal pain and useda 3-point system from \"normal /H110050\" to \"maximal visible pain\" for nine facial parameters to derive anoverall pain scale. 15This system showed good re- liability among four veterinary students and twoveterinarians when looking at 10-minute video re-cordings of stabled horses. An initial outline of a scheme to assess some as- pects of facial expression in ridden horses has beendescribed; 16however, a detailed description of the results was not documented. Head movement, earposition, teeth grinding, and lip movements weredescribed in a study comparing two groups of younghorses (3.5 years of age) when rst lunged under asaddle and rst ridden at a trot following either a\"conventional training approach\" or a \"sympathetictraining approach.\" 17 An ethogram is a catalog of behaviors with specic denitions. An ethogram purpose designed to de-scribe facial expressions in ridden horses (FEReq)was developed, 18and it was shown that it could be applied by observers from variable professionalbackgrounds with satisfactory agreement. It wasalso demonstrated that a trained assessor could dif-ferentiate between lame and non-lame horses basedupon application of the FEReq to photographs of thehorses' heads. 19,20 It has frequently been recognized by the review of patient history that the presence of musculoskeletalpain in horses has long pre-dated its recognitionbecause owners and trainers have failed to recognizethe signicance of behavioral changes during riddenexercise. 21-30In horses, some behaviors such as bucking,29head tossing,31and rearing32during rid-den exercise have been associated with mu sculosk- eletal pain, and classical headshaking has been associated with trigeminal neuralgia.33-36How- ever, the association between other behaviors and pain, such as unwillingness to go forward or being\"above the bit,\" has been poorly documented. It was postulated that these relatively easily ob- served signs might be used to develop a RiddenHorse Ethogram that could improve the ability ofminimally trained observers to differentiate horseswith musculoskeletal pain from those with otherbehavioral, training, or rider problems. 2. Development of the Ridden Horse Ethogram The purpose of the initial study was to develop aRidden Horse Ethogram and to determine whetherit could be applied repeatedly by one trained ob-server (Repeatability Study, 9 horses) and if, byapplication of a related pain behavior score, lamehorses (n /H1100524) and non-lame horses (n /H1100513) could be differentiated. 37It was hypothesized that there would be some overlap in pain behavior scores among non-lame and lame horses and that, overall,non-lame horses would have a lower pain behaviorscore than lame horses. The ethogram was devel-oped with 117 behaviors and horses were gradedtwice in random order by a trained observer usingvideo footage. Overall, there was good correlationbetween the two assessments ( P/H110210.001; R 2/H110050.91). Behaviors that were not consistent across the twoassessments were omitted, reducing the ethogram to70 behaviors. The modied ethogram was appliedto video recordings of the non-lame horses and lamehorses (Ethogram Evaluation). By the amalgama-tion of similar behaviors and by omission of markersthat showed unreliable results in relation to lame-ness the Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram was ulti-mately developed. This comprised 24 behaviors,the majority of which were at least 10 times morelikely to be seen in lame horses versus non-lamehorses (Table 1) (Figs. 1-6). The maximum individual occurrence behavior score for lame horses was 14/24, with a median scoreof 9 and a mean score of 9 (standard deviation [SD]/H110062), compared with a maximum score of 6 for non-lame horses, with a median and a mean score of2 (SD/H110061.4). The following behaviors occurred sig-nicantly more frequently in lame than non-lamehorses (P /H110210.05, Chi-square): one or both ears be- hind vertical for /H113505 s, mouth opening with separa- tion of the teeth for /H1135010 s, tongue out, change in eye posture and expression, front of head /H1135030\u00b0 in front of the vertical for /H1135010 s (above the bit), head tossing, tilting the head, unwillingness to go, crookedness,hurrying, changing gait spontaneously, poor-qualitycanter, resisting or not following the direction of therider's cues, and stumbling and toe dragging. Itwas concluded that the presence of 8 or more of the24 behaviors was likely to reflect musculoskeletalpain. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 335IMAGING AND REHABILITATION3. Application of the Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram to Horses with Musculoskeletal Pain and ComparisonBefore and After Diagnostic Anesthesia To provide further evidence that the behaviors were a reflection of musculoskeletal pain, video record-ings of 10 lame horses were reviewed blindly inrandom order by a trained assessor before and afterdiagnostic anesthesia resolved the baseline lame-ness and improved any gait abnormalities seen incanter. 38The mean and median scores before diag- nostic anesthesia were 12.1 and 12 out of 24, respec-tively (range, 6-14). After lameness resolution,the mean and median scores reduced to 5.9 and 5,respectively (range, 3-10). The marked reductionin behavior scores following resolution of lamenessveried a causal relationship between musculoskel-etal pain and the behaviors. An additional study demonstrated that non-trained assessors from different professional backgroundscould differentiate between lame horses before andafter diagnostic anesthesia had abolished low-gradelameness (most frequent lameness grade, 2/8) byapplication of the Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram. 39 Anonymized video recordings of 21 lame horses, rid-den by professional riders in trot and canter beforeand after diagnostic anesthesia had abolished lame-ness, were reviewed in a random order by a trainedassessor and 10 untrained assessors. For eachhorse, the duration of the recordings before and af-ter diagnostic anesthesia was time matched. Thenumber of behaviors exhibited by the 21 lame horsesprior to diagnostic anesthesia ranged from 3.6 to11.6/24 (median, 9; mean, 9.1). After lameness andoverall performance had been substantially im-proved using number ofbehaviors was signicantly P/H110210.0001), ranging from 1.6 to 8.5/24 (median, 4.5; mean, 4.2). 4. Application of the Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram in Real Time Ten equine veterinarians (the \"test observers\") (af- ter preliminary training) and an experienced asses-sor applied the Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram to 20horse-rider combinations performing a purpose-designed dressage test (8.5 minutes). 40The horses were a convenience sample, in regular work, andcapable of working 'on the bit.' Video recordingsof the test were analyzed the ex-perienced assessor. or muscletension/pain, and rider-skill-level were determinedby independent experts. Sixteen horses were lame,11 had an ill-tting saddle, and 14 had epaxial mus-cle tension/pain. The experienced assessor deter-mined total behavior scores of 3-6/24 for the non-lame horses, 2 lame horses scored 3 and 6, and 14lame horses scored 8-16.

There was no signicant effect of muscle pain, saddle-t, or rider-skill on behavior. It wasconcluded that the Ridden Horse Pain Ethogramwas applied consistently by veterinarians with dif-ferentiation between non-lame and most lamehorses. After appropriate training in its applica-tion, the ethogram may provide a useful tool fordetermining the presence of musculoskeletal pain inhorses performing poorly. 5. Application of the Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram and Its Association with Performance The potential power of the Ridden Horse Pain Etho- gram was demonstrated by its application to horseswarming up for dressage for a four-star (now ve-star) 3-day event. 41Thirty-ve consecutive horses competing on day 2 dressage were each assessed fora minimum of 10 minutes during trot and canter.Horses were classied subjectively as non-lame,lame, or showing a stiff, stilted gait. The RiddenHorse Pain Ethogram was applied by a trained as-sessor. Cross-country performance was obtainedfrom the competition website; horses were classiedas completing, eliminated, or retired. Twenty-seven non-lame horses scored 0-4/24 behaviors(mean and median, 2/24); the most frequently ob-served behaviors were head behind the vertical/H1135010s and mouth open /H1135010s. Eight horses with gait abnormalities scored 3-9/24 (median, 7.5; mean, 6).Thirty-four horses started cross-country. Of 28horses that scored /H110217, 8 (28.6%) were eliminated or retired. Of 6 horses that scored /H113507, 4 (66.7%) were eliminated or retired. The proportion of horses fail-ing to complete was signicantly higher ( P/H110210.01, t test) for scores /H113507, compared with /H110217. However, one horse with a stiff, stilted gait scored 9 but completed.Horses can pass a veterinary inspection but showgait abnormalities when ridden, highlighted by be- Fig. 1.

Gait abnormalities may compro- mise cross-country performance in some horses,although a causal relationship between failure tocomplete and gait abnormalities cannot be proven. 6. The Influence of Rider Size on Ridden Horse Behavior In a prospective, cross-over, randomized trial, six non-lame horses in regular work, 500-600 kg bodyweight, were ridden by four riders of similar ability,but different body 42Horses were evaluated throughout the test for the presence of lameness and the Ridden HorsePain Ethogram was applied in real time. Testswere abandoned for /H11350grade 3/8 lameness or /H1135010 behavioral markers (assessed in real time). TheRidden Horse Pain Ethogram was also applied ret-rospectively to video recordings of predened partsof the test in trot and canter by an experiencedassessor. All 13 H and VH rider tests were abandoned (tem- porary lameness, n/H1100512; behavior, n/H110051 [10/24 behaviors in was 1 of 12 M rider tests(temporary lameness). For the retrospective videoanalysis, there were signicant differences amongriders in the total sum of behaviors for trot (ANOVA,Bonferroni: M vs H, P/H110210.01; L and M vs VH, P/H11021 0.001; H vs VH, P/H110210.05). The total number of behaviors correlated positively with rider weight(Spearman: R /H110050.4, P/H110210.01), although in only 1 of 37 tests was the total behavior score /H113508. The numbers of behaviors reflecting head position andfacial expression were signicantly higher with theheavier riders (ANOVA, Bonferroni: P/H110210.001- 0.05), whereas body markers (head and tail move-ment) and gait markers (behavior, not kinematics)showed non-signicant changes. Statistical com-parisons for canter could not be performed becauseof early abandonment of tests for the H and VHriders. It was concluded that rider size (height and weight) may influence ridden horse behavior, whichmay reflect discomfort. 7. Discussion The observation of 8 or more of the 24 behaviors ofthe Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram is likely to reflect Fig. 3. The horse has an intense stare. The bit is pulled through to the left. The tail is swishing. The lips are sepa-rated, but not the teeth, so this does not constitute mouth open-ing. The horse is sweating disproportionately. Fig. 4.

It isimportant to observe horses from all perspectives(from in front, behind, and the side), performing atleast trot and canter and transitions between gaitsboth going around the periphery of an arena andperforming 10-meter diameter circles in rising trotto ascertain comprehensive scoring. Some horsesshow more signs consistent with pain in canter thanin trot or vice versa. However, pain may only bemanifested in some horses doing more specia-lized and physically demanding movements (e.g.,shoulder-in, collected trot half-pass, and canter fly-ing changes), so inclusion of these movements in theassessment for some horses is recommended. Obser-vation of a horse working for 5 to 10 minutes shouldbe adequate. There is no correlation between lameness severity when ridden and the number of behaviors of theRidden Horse Pain Ethogram that are displayed.It should be borne in mind that if lameness is pres-ent in more than one limb, it may not be gradedaccurately. There is also marked diversity of theoccurrence of each of the 24 behaviors, which is notnecessarily related to lameness grade but to physi-cal musculoskeletal discomfort and perception ofpain by the individual horse. 37-40However, the presence of eight or more behaviors indicates pain,even if overt lameness is not observed. This is im-portant when assessing a horse prior to purchase,evaluating a horse with a history of poor perfor-mance, and when performing routine assessmentsof sports horses to determine if performance could beenhanced. Early recognition of musculoskeletal pain and accurate identication of the source(s) ofpain may enable the successful treatment and, thus,improved performance and minimize the risk of thedevelopment of secondary problems. Training improved the accuracy of interpretation of the FEReq, 37and the Ridden Horse Pain Etho- gram40and is strongly recommended. On-line training is available.43The denitions for each be- havior need to be recognized, understood, and cor- rectly applied. A number of factors need to be assessed before application of the Ridden HorsePain Ethogram. In some horses, the sclera is visi-ble at rest in one or both eyes, so this observationshould not be included in the behavior score. If thebit is too wide, it may erroneously be concluded thatit has been pulled through to one side. If the foot-ing is very deep, this may induce hindlimb toe drag,which may not be observed on a better surface. Some of the features of the Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram could also be influenced by the type of bitand its use and the rider's skill, balance, and use oftheir hands. Preliminary results indicate that thebehavior scores of lame and non-lame horses riddenby riders of differing ability are similar, althoughwork quality may differ a. The mouth repeatedly opening with separation of the teeth and the tongueprotruding were both signicantly associated withlameness. 38It has been suggested that such eva- sions could also be a reaction to the presence of abit 44-47or an ill-tting noseband.48-51However, such evasive behavior may prompt owners to intro- Fig. 5.

Although saddle t did not signicantly influence behavior scores in one study,40an ill-tting saddle does have the potential to induce abnormal behav-iors, which disappear if a better tting saddle is used. There are a number of additional features that have not been assessed objectively but that are ofpotential clinical relevance during ridden exercise:teeth grinding, abnormal breathing noises, grunt-ing, and sweating disproportionate to the level andamount of work, tness, and environmental temper-ature. There are features that may be felt by arider: episodic shooting forwards, absence of reintension (not taking a contact), symmetrically in-creasing rein tension (hanging on the reins), asym- metrical rein tension (hanging on one rein morethan the other), reduced range of motion of thoraco-lumbosacral region (\"back stiffness\"), tension, lackof hindlimb impulsion, and being on the forehand.There are also features of gait that are difcult toreliably measure without high-speed video, such asalterations in canter (e.g., temporal and spatial sep-aration of the hindlimbs during the stance phase).Assessment of blink rate was not performed but maybe useful for future studies. Increased blink ratehas been linked positively to the amount of dopa-mine in the basal ganglia of the brain, 52and dopa- mine levels may increase as a result of pain.53Denitive differentiation between pain or discom- fort induced by tack and other innate behavioralreasons cannot be made on the basis of these stud-ies. When a horse is learning a new movement, itmay misunderstand the rider's cues or nd it phys-ically difcult due to the unaccustomed use of spe-cic m uscle groups, which may result in delayed onset muscular stiffness. 54,55Conflict behavior56 or resistant behavior may be displayed, but persis-tence of such behaviors would not be expected unlessthere was an underlying pain-related problem.Recognition of changes in behavior facilitates recog-nition of improvement in performance and willing-ness to work following improvement or resolution ofpain causing lameness using diagnostic anesthesia.The persistence of 8 or more of the 24 behaviors ofthe Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram is likely to indi-cate residual musculoskeletal pain, requiring fur-ther investigation. The Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram was developed in sports horses used in the Olympic disciplines inwhich the horse is expected to work with the frontof the head in a vertical position, on the bit, whenperforming schooling-type work. However, otherthan head position, the ethogram is readily trans-ferable for other types of work (e.g., jumping), whenworking individually, although close proximity ofother horses may influence behavior. 8. Conclusions It is concluded that the demonstration of 8 or moreof the 24 behaviors of the Ridden Horse Pain Etho-gram is highly likely to reflect the presence of mus-culoskeletal pain in sports horses, although somelame horses score less than 8. It is considered im-portant that those interacting in any way with orresponsible for horses are educated about the signsthat may reflect pain when horses are ridden (e.g.,ears back, mouth opening, tongue out, change in eyeposture and expression, going above the bit, headtossing, tilting the head, unwillingness to go, crook-edness, hurrying, changing gait spontaneously, poorquality canter, resisting, and stumbling and toedragging). If changes in body postures and resistanceto following commands could be used to alert riders ofpotential pain, then the welfare of horses could besignicantly improved. Horses would not fall victimto harder training practices that could further aggra-vate musculoskeletal pain or to a punishment-basedtraining regimen to address the animal's unwilling-ness to follow commands of the rider.

Introduction High-power laser therapy (/H11022 15 W) is used for treat- ment of soft-tissue injuries in humans and horses, but standardized controlled studies on its efcacyare lacking. In this study the effect of high-power laser was evaluated in a standardized le-sion model in horses.2. Materials and Methods In 12 Warmblood horses, lesions were created in all 4lateral suspensory branches. For 4 weeks, each horsewas treated with high-power laser on 2 of the 4 le-sioned branches. Follow up with ultrasound andDoppler was performed blinded during and after treat-ment period. In the short-term study, 6 horses were AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 343IMAGING AND REHABILITATION Research Abstract /L50093for more information, contact the corresponding author NOTESeuthanized 4 weeks post-surgery, whereas in the long- term study, 6 horses were further rehabilitated until 6months and then euthanized. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation was performed blinded onall cadaver limbs. 3. Results and Discussion Transverse lesion size on ultrasound was signi-cantly smaller in the treatment group after 2 and 3months (P /H11005.026 and P/H11005.015). The enlargement of the circumference and cross-sectional area of thelesion over time was signicantly lower in the short-term treatment group (P /H11005.016 and P/H11005.010). During treatment, laser treated branches showed asignicantly increased Doppler signal ( P/H11021.001).On MRI, both short- and long-term groups, the mean signal was signicantly lower ( P/H11005.006) and the cross-sectional area of the lesions signicantlysmaller (P /H11005.002) in the treated branches. These diagnostic imaging parameters indicate signicantenhanced healing of a suspensory branch lesion af-ter high-power laser therapy.

Merriam-Webster dictionary, a bench- mark is dened as something that serves as a stan-dard by which others may be measured or judged. a In business, benchmarking means the purposefulstudy and comparison against outside referencesources, such as industry-aggregated data or a com-petitor, to improve the performance of one's owncompany. In small business, the number-one order of nan- cial interpretation is to assure internally generateddata is reliable, accurate, and consistent. To oth-erwise embark on benchmarking expeditionsagainst outside data citations is a fool's journey.Until internal data accumulation is commandeeredand practice results understood, an external bench-mark endeavor is a waste of time and resources.First assure internal practice data trends are wellunderstood and acted upon. A good analogy can be made with the conduct of veterinary medical practice: the widely understood language of scientic nomenclature and medical ter-minology allows swift and accurate communicationamong veterinary medical professionals. Consis-tent ways of describing patient history, physical ob- servations, and surgical and medical proceduresincrease practice quality and efciency. Similarly, understanding accounting and busi- ness intelligence terminology aids communicationabout the nancial health of a veterinary practice inthe same way. Wise use of technology further en- hances nancial data visualization and interpreta- tion. The combination of affordable software,cognitive computing, accelerating application de-velopment, powerful personal computer proces-sors, and cloud computing in the space of \"bigdata\" requires an even greater level of businessintelligence sophistication in successful veteri-nary practices. The basis of reliable nancial and other essential practice data is a sound organized approach for me-thodic collection, recording, sorting, and summariza-tion. In the case of operational and nancial data, areliable accounting system depends on accurate cate-gorization of each practice's nancial transaction byknowledgeable and trained personnel. Veterinarypractice bookkeeping and accounting systems also re-quire logical organization of data into reports that AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 345BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING THE HEALTH OF YOUR PRACTICE AND PERSONNEL NOTESenhance management assessment of economic out- comes, including benchmarking activities. 2. Solutions and Discussion System of Data Organization Required Veterinary practice nancial data organization re- quires a chart of accounts. In 2005, the author'srm expressly designed the Equine Veterinary Prac-tice Chart of Accounts (EVPCOA), an organized listof all the asset, liability, equity, income, and expenseaccounts used in an equine veterinary practice forcategorizing and recording each nancial transac-tion. 1In 2017, Veterinary Study Groups with American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) andAmerican Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA)published an updated version of a Chart of Accounts(COA) geared toward companion animal practices. Because the author's rm was the primary author of this latter project, the EVPCOA and CompanionAnimal COA are not tremendously dissimilar. Oneor the other implemented by well-trained bookkeeperswill put the practice's accounting house in order, lead-ing to the consistent and efcient collection and aggre-gation of data that can be reasonably benchmarkedagainst practice history, as well as the potential forcomparison to other practices using similar businessprocesses. Foundational Work Leads to Practice Financial Health2 In the second of two conference papers3the impor- tance of underlying practice principles to guide anddrive success is discussed: Mission, Vision, Profes-sional Ethics, and Core Values. These critical elements lead directly to the specic measures of practice nancial health. Considerthem equally to that of establishing internal sys-tems of accounting and measurement that allowspractice leadership to optimize healthy nancialperformance over the long haul. Methodical approaches to planning eventually il- luminates the need for historical trends and under-standing of current practice activities, that lead toestablished activities to drive future performancewith predictability. Avoiding Analysis Paralysis With the proliferation of computer applications rep-resenting the new normal of business life, managerseasily become overwhelmed with data and reports tothe point that detail may obscure the overall prac-tice situation. As the saying goes, the forest view is lost because of the trees. Too much detail potentially causes inertia and con- fusion. More to the point, how can anyone nd thetime to sift through all this information, let alone actupon the information it conveys in the moment? Thus, businesses emphasize real-time \"bird's-eye\" views of selected data, most often called KPIs.KPIs are presented in innite varieties of interac-tive formats. While technology increasingly pro-vides self-serve applications to achieve the 10,000-foot perspective, all share common elements: KPIs /H11005mission-critical indices that give \"at-a- glance\" data points. Data trends /H11005KPIs are followed over time and indicate and predict practice economic health. Reliable systems /H11005KPIs and KPI trends are only as good as the data input, by trainedpersonnel with attentive eyes to accuracy andconsistency, and through appropriate over-sight by administration, and using the veteri-nary practice COA. Timeliness /H11005quick report turnaround is needed to guide practice decisions. Goal accountability /H11005practice strategic plan- ning and goal setting leads to methodic choiceof key performance drivers, activities that en-courage employee success in advancing se-lected objectives. The foundation for operational KPIs and manage-ment reporting rests on consistent protocols for datacollection. The typical baseline operational KPIsoriginate from both the nancial accounting andveterinary practice information management soft-ware (VPIMS) reports. Because data are plentiful and time is scant, a limited number of KPIs are usually chosen based onsignicance to sustaining practice protability. Prot is crucial to practice longevity.Prot replenishes the supplies used.Prot allows planning for contingencies.Prot leads to adequate reserves when equip- ment suddenly breaks and must be replaced. Prot allows more compensation for those de- serving through their work ethic and effort. Benchmarks of Success That Everyone Should Consider 1. Protability a. What is itb. How is it measured 2.

Marketing outreach\u2014social media goals Desperately Seeking Causality Ask any veterinary practice owner or consultant if theywant to see benchmarks that imply causality to highprot. They will immediately lean in with rapt atten-tion. Unfortunately, linking one piece of operationaldata to another does not necessarily provide the reasonsfor success or create a road map to improvement. Unique, ambiguous, and perceived-as-unmeasur- able characteristics are often considered possible cor-relating factors but are difcult to conrm or verify:a veterinarian's charismatic persona, positive teamattitude, satised client perceptions, tidy practice ap-pearance, and convenient location, and many more. What performance characteristics lead to nan- cial success that aren't measured? To a large ex-tent, the missing components relate to lack of aclearly documented, contemporaneous understand-ing of what clients and employees think and feel.Why does one practice have high turnover and an-other doesn't? How do such factors impact eachpractice entity's protability and ability to grow overtime? Why do some hospitals successfully optimizeclient attendance and referrals and others fail? Connecting the X's and O's These squishy questions relate to what is now calledexperiential data, otherwise called X-data. This isa different kind of data that gains practice insightinto why operational data (O-data) show what itdoes on an historical basis. By contemporaneouslycollecting information and opinions, thoughts, andfeelings from the people important to business suc-cess, practice stakeholders can increasingly under-stand where they can do better to improveoperational data outcomes. X-data provide important, missing insight into business challenges faced in a new virtual world fullof social media influence, information overload, andcompetition that spans far beyond local colleagues.It is easy to relate to massive business environmentchanges when a veterinary practice managementteam experiences the horror of an angry client opin-ing untruths on Facebook or through a Yelp review.Businesses of all kinds are punished by an upsetclient when employee experience is not up to par. Veterinary managers and practice owners have long intuited that there must be missing compo-nents that can be measured, correlated to prot, andmanaged, especially when they get very interestedin analyzing operational data and then guring outhow can they make it better. The missing compo-nents are measurements of the human experience,and the gaps between what managers think is hap-pening, what the client feels, and what actual mea-surements might show.Articial intelligence and machine learning allow powerful and capable collection and interpretationof data, including experiential. In business, fourfoundational aspects of X-data have been described:Brand, Product, Client, and Employee. Each ofthese arenas is of intense articial intelligence de-velopmental interest: robust applications can cu-rate surveyed opinions and perspectives and exploitthe results to identify gaps that a business can nar-row to gain competitive advantage. Net Promoter Score A good example of the new business world, wherecompanies increasingly seek shortcut approaches toassessing experiential data is the Net PromoterScore (NPS; Fig. 1). NPS is a simple pulse surveymethod that attempts to measure client loyalty to acompany or brand. Introduced by a 2003 HarvardBusiness Review article (\"The One Number YouNeed to Grow\"), NPS has evolved into the mostcommonly used measure of purported customer sat-isfaction and revenue growth correlation. NPS is measured by a one- or two-question sur- vey. The rst, and sometimes only, question asks\"On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recom-mend our practice to a friend?\" The second op-tional follow-up question seeks client explanation ofthe rating. As for any data point that is measured and mon- itored, the regularly tracked NPS trend for a prac-tice may be the most important benchmarkingfactor. An internet search for veterinary NPS data,turned up a 2019 reference citing an average of 30,with a score of 55 correlated with clients who feelhighly empowered about care of their pets. bAn older 2012 article based on \"hundreds\" of UK prac-tices, yielded a NPS of 75.8 (promoters of 81.3% anddetractors of 5.5), while a survey across 15 Europeancountries via an online pet forum with 304 respon-dents scored 55. c In a June 21, 2018 blog, the author explained his practice's score was 84%, and mentioned an overall Fig. 1. The net promoter score is the number one key perfor- mance indicator. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 347BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING THE HEALTH OF YOUR PRACTICE AND PERSONNEL33% response rate to the NPS survey, that was far higher than previous response rates of 10% to othertypes of customer surveys. d Prot is the ultimate KPI. Actually, prot will comprise TWO KPIs to manage: prot as a mone-tary amount and net prot as a percentage of grossincome, otherwise called prot margin. Prot mar- gin provides a better idea of practice nancialstrength than does prot. A veterinary practicecan show some level of prot in dollars, but a lowprot margin suggests a weak nancial position. There are many more metrics that include prot as a component of the calculation, but for the pur-poses of nearly all veterinary practices, managersfollow and tend these two. Very generally, prot is dened as revenues mi- nus expenses. Yet prot is measured in differentways, with nuanced denitions. Here oper-ations (operating prot). This last term, operatingprot, is of most interest from a managerial perspec-tive since it measures prot from the activities lim-ited to veterinary practice. Operating prot equals operating revenue minus operating expenditures,and excludes taxes, interest expense, and interestincome. The unique aspects of each and every veterinary practice affects its operating prot and prot mar-gin: location, local demographics and householdincome, species mix, competing service-provider op-tions, pricing strategies, mix of service and productofferings, market presence, practice size (revenuesand doctor numbers), and many more factors. The industry range of veterinary practice operat- ing prot margin is 1% to 25%, but most 5%to Excellent prot margin is generally consid-ered 17% to or more, good is 13%, and underperforming 5% to 10%. Fourpercent or lower is cause for long-term survival con-cern, unless there are mitigating factors such asrecent startup or transitioning into a signicantlylarger facility. Even so, a practice generating $6 MM with steady annual growth, and operating prot margin of 8% Fig. 2. Prot margin computation. 348 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING THE HEALTH OF YOUR PRACTICE AND PERSONNEL(operating prot of $480,000), would be considered by many to be a superior practice to one with $1.5MM of operating revenue and operating prot mar-gin of 20% (operating prot of $300,000). Ofcourse, numerous other factors would come to bear.Value is very much in the eye of the beholder. Managers should know how to measure operating prot, even if it is just an approximation. In small,closely held businesses, interpreting prot usuallyrequires a robust understanding of the elements ofthe nancial statements, especially those of theprot and loss statement. The nature of small-business nancial report preparation obscuresresults. Examples are listed below:Small-business bookkeeping fullls dual purpos-es: annual tax reporting and managementinterpretation/decision making. Most all prac-tices keep one set of books for both purposes. These two purposes conflict: taxpayers striveto defer tax payment to the extent possiblethrough a variety of strategies that reducetaxable income. At the same time, practiceowners wish to see prot trending at improvedlevels year over year and against industrybenchmarks. For advanced analysis of practice prot, engageexperts for practice valuation services (also called Fig. 3. Sample practice budget.

Common ranges of equine practice operating expenses compared to operating revenues.

Otherwise, professionals (CPAs, valuation experts) can perform lower-level protability analytics that are extraordinarily help-ful for strategic planning, budgets, and nancialprojections. Good nancial management requiresannual assessment of practice operating prottrends. As for all KPIs, the starting point of operating prot measurement is reliable data availed throughthe annual prot and loss reports. Because thisnancial statement is primarily structured for taxreporting purposes, one can expect the strategiesused to reduce taxable prot and taxes will cloudoperational prots and practice nancial perfor-mance. The strategies used often depend on thechosen type of legal entity: proprietorship, part-nership, corporation. Taxable prot for income tax reporting purposes usually approximates the bottom line of the smallbusiness prot and loss statement. Each legal en-tity type determines the required bottom-line ad-justments to estimate operational prot. For mostveterinary practices, the required adjustments in-clude the following: Restating owner (and owner family member)compensation and benet expenses to amountsthat reflect owner value to the practice as em-ployees, providing services in exchange forpayment. Compensation and benets shouldbe comparable to what the practice would nor-mally pay a non-owner employee for similarexpertise and duties. If one or more practice owners also own thepractice real estate, restate rent expendituresto the amount that reflects fair rental cost forthe use of the real estate by the veterinarypractice occupant. Depreciation and amortization expense mustbe adjusted to reflect a reasonable estimate ofannual wear, tear, and obsolescence of medicalequipment, and other tangible capital assets/property (called \"economic decline\"). Any expensed equipment costs should beadded back. Any lease payments for equipment that willeventually be owned ( purchase-lease orcapi- tal-lease) should be added back. Any extraordinary expenditures deducted in asingle year should be adjusted. For example,a major website overhaul or signicant main-tenance or repair expenditures hitting all in 1year. Interest income and other non-operationalsources of revenues are excluded. Interest expense and non-operating expensesare excluded. Corporate income taxes are added back (ifany). Fig. 2 shows a prot margin calculation applied totypical veterinary practice prot and loss report ortax return. Practice Budgets\u2014The Foundation for Operational Objective Measurement A crucial element of business scorecard and KPI use is the art of projecting the practice's nancial results Fig. 5. Continued 352 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING THE HEALTH OF YOUR PRACTICE AND PERSONNELthrough annual budgets. Financial budgets and plans are important to strategic planning in twomain ways: 1) budgeting measures progress to-ward goals, and 2) good planning and budgeting areneeded to fund each part of the strategic plan. The minimum level of serious nancial manage- ment is traditional budget preparation. Since re-cent nancial history is a general predictor ofexpected practice performance in the coming 12-month cycle, traditional budgeting starts with themost recent 2 to 3 years of prot and loss reports, incomputer spreadsheet format. Operating revenues and expenses, as well as per- centages of gross income, are projected forward, us-ing documented assumptions such as the rate ofpractice income growth, client numbers, fee adjust-ments, vendor pricing changes, and employee com-pensation requirements. Spreadsheets allow easy manipulation of budget data, computed in different and often complex waysthat aid \"what-if analysis.\" What-if analysis is apowerful scenario-planning process using spread-sheet models, where different numbers are appliedto key variables to see what the overall effect will beon projected results. For example, \"What if Cost ofProfessional Services is reduced by 2 percentagepoints? What resulting net prot result could beexpected?\" Well-designed and maintained practice budget spreadsheets become powerful tools over future pe-riods, as they are carried forward, modied, andadapted to new assumptions and current situations.With increasing levels of expertise, spreadsheet us-ers will keep projections updated with monthly op-erational results, comparing them to previouslypredicted targets and revising the 12-month forecastso that it is regularly rolled forward with new tar-gets established. During this process, budget variances are identi- ed. Budget variances are the gaps between pro-jected targets established in the budget process andthe actual results achieved as time progresses. Variances are most often displayed in dollar amount differences, the percentage increase or de-crease, and the differences in each monetary lineitem expressed as a percentage of gross income.Selected variances become important KPIs in theirown rights, that will be important to track. Fig. 3 shows the initial page of a practice budget depicts how arranged columns display actual resultsand budgeted amounts and the resulting variances,highlighting practice performance for each metric.Please note that not all pages of the budget areshown. Breakeven analysis also derives from nancial re- sult measurement. Like budgeting, breakevenanalysis can be adapted for different, important ar-eas of practice planning. Daily break-even targets Breakeven analysis of pharmaceutical sales inconcert with employee commissions, to deter-mine appropriate pricing Breakeven analysis of equipment investmentand use, to assist in procedure pricing anddaily or weekly use targets Primary goals of budget variance tracking andbreakeven analysis are to: Support targeted practice protability Use predictive analysis to identify gaps in realtime, allowing timely prescriptive action Inspire and challenge leaders to improve prac-tice nancial health through actionable insight Successful strategy implementation requires nan-cial plans created through budgets and breakevencalculations, because it often takes money to bringtactical and operational plans to fruition. Manag-ers must be able to predict expenditures with somesemblance of reality. Resource allocation to imple-ment a strategic plan typically includes outlays forequipment, payroll, supplies, and contracted ser-vices, in addition to deciding pricing and fee assign-ment (Fig. 4). An interesting application of daily breakeven rev- enue targets involves posting the targets by day on amonthly calendar. Daily comparison results areposted for employee visualization, in green or red orany other simple way to illuminate accomplishmentor deciency (arrow up/down). Daily breakeven revenues and client activity can be projected in real time, once the data is drilledwith A.I. applications. With seasonality and desireto plan stafng levels, past history and trends can beused to plot forward to the exactness of day and hourpractice activity. Since payroll and related humancapital expenses are the largest part of the cost piefor most every veterinary practice, any tools an hu-man resources (HR) manager can leverage becomeextremely valuable for creating efciency and ele-vating prot. Operating Expense KPIs The nal KPI graphic to share is that presently com-mon ranges of equine practice operating expensescompared with operating revenues (Fig. 5). Surpris-ingly, these have changed little over the last 3 decades,although some new accounts have been added to theCOA listing, such as for internet pharmacy revenuesand costs of website and social media marketing.

Introduction How does a veterinarian know a horse's long-term response to their comprehensive laminitis manage-ment protocols unless they track its health progresswith uniform measurement? How does a practicemanager determine that implementation of fee in-creases resulted in projected nancial outcomes?What metrics does an administrator purposefullydesign to ascertain client satisfaction and employeeengagement? Each of these questions highlights the veterinary business need to strategically plan and measure se- lected data that does more than document historicalresults. Businesses must choose data collectionand reporting wisely, preferably actionable datathat drive continual improvement. Data are plen-tiful and time is scant; successful business strat-egy requires an intelligent selection of relevantmetrics. Before assessing a practice's nancial health, rst ensure the practice uses tools and procedures tomaintain accurate records. 1Reliable internal dataallow a reasonable evaluation of performance. Too many practices have not invested in dependable sys-tems that allow nuanced interpretation. Strategic execution requires fact-based informa- tion. To gain competitive advantage, make contin-uous effort toward data quality improvement viainternal processes and policies, use technology andmachine learning, and explore new options tostreamline data collection and interpretation time. In veterinary practice nancial management, the prime requirement for benchmarking is the practiceitself: how does it currently compare to the base-line nancial health of last month or last year?Second, well-curated data ideally allow a managerto compare the practice to others of a similar\"breed,\" such as to other equine ambulatory or re-ferral hospital practices. Everyone wants benchmarks, and yet, aggregated industry data can mislead. Does a comparison ofany particular practice's nancial health to pub-lished benchmarks have meaning? Is a practiceowner or manager able to make that determination?In the end, managers are best served understanding AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 355BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING THE HEALTH OF YOUR PRACTICE AND PERSONNEL NOTESthe practice's internal analytics, being comfortable with their interpretation, and maintaining balancedskepticism of external benchmarks. Solution and Discussion A discussion of practice nancial health bettermentcan only begin by enumerating certain principles.These essential principles underlie everything a man-ager will undertake with data mining, applicationselection, industry benchmarking, and executive deci-sion-making. Long-term, sustainable nancialhealth has the following characteristics: A dened business purpose. Stakeholder core values and vision. Veterinary professional ethical guidelines. Retained and reinforced in institutional memory,these factors form the foundation of a practice's mis-sion and vision statements. From these two state-ments, business strategy will flow, with a cascade ofstated strategic objectives propagated throughoutthe organization. Strategic objectives dene the data selected for collection, measurement, comparison, and dissemi-nation through various reporting mechanisms.Measurable data allow an understanding of wherethe practice has been and where it is going. Good practice management decisions are founded in facts. Facts are derived from observations ofday-to-day occurrences; yet, it is impossible to remem- ber everything that has occurred without systems ofdocumentation and measurement. Even a good man-ager cannot be everywhere at once. Concurrently,data exponentially increase. Paucity of data is notthe challenge. The struggle is wrangling data intomanageable, timely, and usable chunks. A signicant practice-managed duty is that of monitoring data trends as well as directing day-to-day activities in accord with the overall practicestrategy. Data wrangling historically demanded(and still does) much labor to isolate raw datapoints, compute them into desired key performanceindicators (KPIs), compile them, and trend them.Despite what feels like an overwhelming sea of data,managing a veterinary practice by the numbers isbecoming easier because of increasingly seamlessapplications to sort and present information in eas-ily consumable visualizations. Influence of Cognitive Computing and Business Intelligence in Practice Management Cognitive computing is the assimilation of massive volumes of structured and unstructured data intomanageable content. Business intelligence (BI)uses tools and techniques to deliver relevant, reli-able, and real-time information with the goal ofmaking better decisions faster. BI takes a vastamount of practice data and presents the informa-tion in meaningful, actionable ways. BI applica-tions include employee performance management,customer experience feedback, operational analyt-ics, data and text mining, predictive and prescrip-tive process modeling, and much more. With an increasingly nuanced ability to self-serve and visualize real-time data, managers should seekadvantage through applications that allow system-atic data collection and reporting. The valuabletime saved from manipulating data into usable for-mats can instead be used to strategize operationalimprovement and the employee training required toenable it. Employees likewise gain timely feedbackon the results of their work efforts through mobileapplications. Organizational Framework for Selecting Actionable Data2 Business intelligence tools and design are based inwell-known and established models. An especiallyuseful model for veterinary practice management isthe balanced score card. In the early 1990s, Dr. Robert Kaplan aand Dr. David Norton at Harvard Business School publisheda model for innovative strategic planning and per-formance management: the balanced scorecard.The model organizes a business into four equallyimportant themes. Each focused area is dened byspecic critical success factors that are distilled intomeasurable targets and become the basis for action-able data in the form of KPIs. The balanced scorecard helps leadership clarify the practice's vision and strategy (which are oftenrather abstract) and translate them into dened,measurable activities that guide progress in creat-ing value through investment in patients, clients,employees, suppliers, processes, and technology. The author's rm modied Kaplan's model for vet- erinary practice implementation, calling it the Vet-erinary Practice Scorecard (VPS) and used it todesign and plan specic tactics in each of the fouraspects of business focus: The patient care/internal processes perspective. The client perspective. The employee growth, learning and innovationperspective. The nancial perspective. To maintain a healthy balance in leadership andmanagerial effort, each perspective receives equalattention and weight in the analysis. State objec-tives for each aspect and determine metrics that willmost effectively measure progress and drive behavior leading to successful accomplishment of the objectives.Consider the questions posed for each perspective thatdrive objective development (Fig. 1). Figure 2 shows an example of a balanced score card, demonstrating objectives, KPI choices andmeasurement, targets, target gaps, and estimates oftarget achievement. In a real-time digital environment (think Smart phone), the user would be able to click through onany current KPI measurements to observe its trend 356 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING THE HEALTH OF YOUR PRACTICE AND PERSONNELover any period of time and obtain a comparison with any prior selected period or date range. Self-serve options are useful when seasonal practiceactivity is a complicating factor to baseline compar-ison, and alternate date ranges can clarifyinterpretation. The following examples of KPI trends use Excel spreadsheet models, updated by month, and includea moving trailing 12-month total (TTT). The TTTtrendline is extremely helpful for visualizing prac-tice improvement or adverse changes that should bequickly addressed (Fig. 3). Many available business intelligence applications are built on balanced scorecard modeling. The for-ward thrust of these apps is to extract and combinedata from multiple databases within the business.The apps knit the results together into effective datavisualization through virtual dashboards.

Nothingis static; the aggregated data are real time. The data dashboards integrate into the scorecard presentations often in a simplied manner. Figure4 shows an example of effective data visualization,using a single KPI data point with its trend. Moving from KPIs to Key Performance Drivers Measurement is an ever present and im portant fun- damental of practice nancial health, but only somemeasurements mean much. The measurementsmost important to organizational progress are calledKPIs.To see how a veterinary practice is evolving, mea- surements, trends, correlations, and comparisonsare needed. KPIs that provide actionable insightsin real time are the lifeblood of business intelligence. KPIs can be lagging, giving an historical perspec- tive, and providing a reasonable prediction of futureactivity. Forward-looking KPIs that prompt desir-able employee behaviors and thus cause perfor-mance change are called key performance drivers(KPDs). These metrics shape desired activity to Table 1.

A well-designed balance of KPIs and KPDs support management guru Peter Druck-er's famous quote, \"what gets measured, gets done.\" Use KPDs to improve behavior to hit pre-deter- mined targets and the desired level of performance. Some examples of KPIs and correlating KPDs can be found in Table 1. Obstacles to KPI Use in Managing a Practice The primary reason for KPI problems and analysisparalysis is a failure to use a disciplined methodol-ogy, such as balance score card modeling and settingdened strategic objectives that form the basis forthe KPIs your practice uses. Simply measuring thedata you always have or because it is easiest toobtain results in underperformance. Likewise,brainstorming KPIs without a purposeful vision is aproblem. Successfully developing and implementing KPIs is a disciplined process. Achieving any successfulbusiness intelligence methodology for improvementover time uses the dened process, such as the step-wise KPI development graphic (Fig. 5). Given that the long-term sustainability of KPI implementation requires discipline, the critical fac-tors for success are as follows: 1. Engaged practice leadership that is commit- ted to the process. 2. Effective change management through lead- ership's concerted support of change, includ-ing clear team communications of clearlyidentied key steps. 3. Healthy practice culture using fact-based de- cision making (rather than dependence on gutinstinct). 4. Intentional culture shift through learning to use performance measurement methodsappropriately. 5. Strong project management skills for improved execution of KPI implementation and use.6. Employees supporting team focus on continu- ous process improvement. 7. Long-term commitment to using KPIs to man- age the practice. a,b To gain competitive advantage, practice leaders andmanagers should make continuous effort towarddata quality improvement via internal processesand policies, use technology and machine learning,and explore new options to streamline data collec-tion and interpretation time.

Introduction Once you are trying to become pregnant or have conrmation that you are, you must take precau-tions for your developing child. Working in a phys-ically strenuous job during pregnancy creates ahigher risk prole, though it can also have benets.An overview of general risks and common issues willprovide a basis of awareness that can assist in max-imizing the safety of your developing child and in-creasing your comfort. 2. Discussion General Risks Each woman is an individual, and some will have a higher risk tolerance than others, and each preg-nancy will be different. Flexibility and good com-munication will go a long way toward having asmooth experience. All workplaces, includingthose outside of veterinary medicine, can affect yoursafety, even when you are not pregnant. Slippingon a wet floor, tripping on a cord, lifting somethingheavy, reaching overhead, using a stool or ladder,and climbing stairs are all hazards that can causeinjury in most workplaces. Being pregnant exacer-bates those general risks due to changes in balanceand hormonal softening of ligaments. Traumatic Injuries Ambulatory equine practitioners often drive 30,000 to 50,000 miles each year, increasing their risk of anauto accident. Even those with less mileage oftenmultitask while driving, which increases the risk ofinattention to the road. Those veterinarians whowork in large-animal practice are also at risk forinjury simply from the size of the animals they treat.Taking normal precautions may be inadequate, as apregnant woman has a changed balance and bodyshape. Do not hesitate to utilize sedation and askfor help in restraining animals for treatment. \"Various anatomic and physiologic changes of pregnancy may alter the type of injury experiencedby pregnant women. These changes may also alterthe manifestations of given injuries and the treat-ment required to re-establish maternal-fetal hemo-stasis.\" 1Trauma in pregnancy remains one of the major contributors to maternal and fetal morbidityand mortality. Potential complications include ma-ternal injury or death, shock, internal hemorrhage,intrauterine fetal demise, direct fetal injury, abrup- 360 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING THE HEALTH OF YOUR PRACTICE AND PERSONNEL NOTEStio placentae, and uterine rupture. The leading causes of obstetric trauma in the general populationare motor vehicle accidents, falls, assaults, andgunshots. These injuries are classied as blunt ab-dominal trauma, pelvic fractures, or penetratingtrauma. 2Unique to equine and bovine work are kicks, strikes, and crushing by patients. Lifting, Standing, and Long Shifts According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, heavy lifting, standing for longperiods of time, or bending a lot during pregnancycan increase your chances of miscarriage, pre-termbirth, or injury during pregnancy. 3Consult with your obstetrician about appropriate restrictions, ifany. Jobs involving high physical demands, suchas bending at the waist more than 20 times per dayor lifting objects more than once every 5 minutes,may increase risks for adverse birth outcomes.Pregnant women are at higher risk of an injurywhile lifting due to differences in posture, balance,and an inability to hold things close to the bodybecause of changing abdominal size. In addition,changes in a pregnant woman's hormones have aneffect on ligaments and joints in the spine. Thesechanges make a pregnant woman more prone toinjury from lifting heavy equipment or strenuouswork with patients. 3 Generally, 25 pounds is the limit for lifting in most healthy pregnancies, and past 20 weeks, thisamount decreases. Specic recommendations canbe found for recommended weight limits in early andlate pregnancy for 3 lift frequency patterns. 4In all types of lifting, proper form is essential. Bend atyour knees, not your waist, keep the load close toyour body, and lift with your legs, not your back.Avoid twisting your body while lifting. In the prac-tice, use your assistant or a client to carry heavyequipment, and be cautious with holding up hooves.In the small-animal hospital, don't try to lift heavierpatients by yourself. Equine practitioners are generally moving around frequently all day, which can ease muscle tensionand help prevent fluid buildup in legs and feet.Elevate your legs whenever possible if you are expe-riencing swelling. If you must be on your feet forlong periods of time, rest one foot alternativelywith the other on a stool or other slightly elevatedplatform, wear comfortable shoes with good archsupport, and take breaks to sit down. You mightalso consider wearing compression socks and looseclothing. 5 Nausea and Other Discomforts Being pregnant can present additional physical challenges at the workplace. To stay productive atwork, you must try to alleviate common pregnancydiscomforts. One of the most distressing of symp-toms can be nausea and vomiting. It may be called\"morning\" sickness, but it can hit at any time.Studies have shown that women with nausea andvomiting during the rst trimester have a lower riskof miscarriage than do women without these symp-toms. 6Morning sickness affects around 80% of all pregnant females.7To ease nausea at work, avoid your triggers as much as possible. Some odors inveterinary medicine may be particularly difcult totolerate, and these differ from woman to woman.Increase ventilation and avoid smelly things likeanaerobic abscesses, anal sacs, and parvo or rotavi-ral diarrhea. It may help to snack often on crack-ers and other bland foods, or drink ginger ale orginger tea. If you are vomiting, you will need tomaintain your hydration. If you are queasy, youmay want to prepare your client before you have theneed to rush out of the stall or exam room. Handling the fatigue of pregnancy can be tough. It might help to eat foods rich in iron and protein,because fatigue can be a symptom of iron deciencyanemia. Take short, frequent breaks if you can.Getting up and moving around for a few minutesoutside may reinvigorate you. Or if you are on yourfeet continually, spending a few minutes with youreyes closed and your feet up also can help you re-charge. If you are an ambulatory equine practitio-ner, pull your truck over for a 5-minute catnap.Don't neglect to drink plenty of water. Cuttingback on activities that are not essential can help youget more rest when your workday ends. Considerhiring someone for domestic tasks or simply loweryour standards. Go to bed early in order to get atleast 8 hours of sleep every night. If you're repeat-edly feeling depleted, listen to your body and con-sider cutting back on your work hours or the timeyou spend standing. If you are still in an emer-gency on-call rotation and are exhausted, considerstopping until you return from your maternity leave. Stress Veterinarians are often perfectionists and feel they should be able to perform at their peak at allthings at all times. This can result in feeling likeyou are failing to be your best at anything you do.In order to keep stress under control, be kind toyourself. Growing a baby is hard work! Priori-tize your tasks by making daily to-do lists andconsider what you could delegate or eliminate.Maintain supportive relationships and share yourfears and frustrations. Find some time for delib-erate relaxation, even if it is just 5 minutes ofmeditation and focused breathing. Consider aprenatal yoga class, if your health care providerfeels you are physically able. Rest. Many stud-ies have shown the negative effects of stress onyour health. Your Rights as a Pregnant Worker Title VII of the Civil Rights Act forbids employerswith 15 or more workers on their payroll fromrefusing to hire, discharging, or otherwise dis-criminating against any person because of thatperson's gender. However, the Supreme Court AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 361BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING THE HEALTH OF YOUR PRACTICE AND PERSONNELruled in a mid-1970s case that discrimination based on pregnancy was not the same as discrim-ination based on sex. As a result, the PregnancyDiscrimination Act of 1978 was passed, which ex-plicitly requires that all employers treat pregnantand non-pregnant employees equivalently, both interms of benets received and all other respects.This act requires employers to treat a pregnantemployee the same as any other temporarily dis-abled worker, if she is unable to perform her workbecause of her pregnancy. Since the Americanswith Disabilities Act was passed in 1990, accom-modation of employees with disabilities has been astandard feature of antidiscrimination law for USemployers having 15 or more employees. Somestate disability laws are applicable to businesseswith just a few employees. Links to these state lawsare available at https://www.workplacefairness. org/ disability-discrimination-state-law. Maternity Leave Most veterinary practices do not offer paid mater-nity leave. In fact, in the United States, 88% ofwomen do not receive any paid time off after givingbirth, and 25% return to work within 2 weeks ofgiving birth. 8The disability after a vaginal birth is considered to be 6 weeks, and a C-section, 8 weeks.There is an increased risk of injury when returningto work before this time. You may wish to take out a short-term disability insurance policy if you plan to become pregnant inthe future and are not covered under your employ-er's policy. Pregnancy, as well as the postpartumperiod, is one of the most commonly covered \"dis-abilities\" that prevent an employee from working.Carefully evaluate the coverage you are purchas-ing to be sure it fullls your needs. Typically,short-term disability leave policies cover 6 weeksof pay at some percentage (up to 100% dependingon your policy) for a vaginal birth and 8 weeks ofpay for a Caesarean birth. Inquire of your practice owner whether you can accumulate unused vacation time from the previousyear to use in the current year for a maternity leave.If not, at least try to save all your paid time off foryour leave. Begin saving some of each paycheck fora year before your delivery. Just $50 a week willadd up to $2600 in a year. Every little bit will help.Consider your budget for each month's expenses andmake a nancial plan for your anticipated length ofmaternity leave. Because you can't be certainwhether health issues for you or your baby will arise, try to be generous in your planning. With the current difculty that practices are hav- ing in nding and keeping veterinarians, leave pol-icies may change in the veterinary industry. If youexpect to have a family, inquire about maternityleave policies before accepting a position. If you arecurrently working at a practice with no paid mater-nity leave, consider negotiating for some. Remain-ing healthy with minimal injuries will allow you to stay in the career for the long haul. Planning Your Return to Work Because you cannot anticipate how you or your babywill fare after birth, keep all discussions about thelength of your maternity leave tentative. Be honestabout your intention to return in a certain timeframe but be clear that this could be limited byhealth concerns. If it is your health that is im-paired, and your doctor has not cleared you to returnto work, you will be considered disabled. Then youmust be treated as any other disabled employeewould be treated. If your baby has health concerns,perhaps you can return to work on a modied sched-ule or delay your return. The individual circum-stances of the practice will dictate what is possible. If at all possible, plan to return part-time at rst for at least a few weeks, to allow both you and thebaby to adjust. You are much more likely to beinjured or have an auto accident when you are sleepdeprived. If you are generally in the on-call sched-ule, see if you can return to it just 1 night a week atrst. But remember, your team members haveprobably been picking up extra shifts in your ab-sence, and their patience may be wearing thin.Practices with many childless employees are oftenless willing to accommodate the inconvenience of a maternity leave with grace. Express your appreci-ation for their sacrice. Even though they may bedrawing more pay for more work, there's a goodchance they would rather have the time off. Re-member this as you adjust to your new life with achild and try to express your respect for their needfor time away from the practice, giving it equalweight to the time you need for your family. 3. Conclusion Educate yourself about the risks in your workdayand the common hardships of pregnancy. Deter-mine what areas concern you most. Most employ-ers will be understanding, but not all. The practicewill be affected for about a year with each preg-nancy, and as the child grows, the company may be affected further with childhood illnesses, doctor'sappointments and school events. Some family-oriented practices celebrate those parts of life, andothers don't. Remember that you have manychoices. It is your responsibility to shape the lifeyou want to lead.

Introduction Whether you are an associate, an owner, or a staff member at a veterinary hospital, once you are tryingto become pregnant or have conrmation that youare, you must take precautions for your developingchild. Working in veterinary medicine increasesyour risks due to possible exposure to radiation,anesthetic gases, pharmaceuticals, zoonotic dis-eases, and viruses or bacteria. An overview ofveterinary specic risks will provide a basis ofawareness that can assist in maximizing yoursafety and that of your developing child. In ad-dition, employers with a thorough understandingof the risks veterinary medicine holds for theyoung women on their team can better navigatenecessary accommodations. 2. Discussion General Considerations Since the rst trimester is the time of the most crucial development, avoiding risks in pregnancy assoon as possible simply makes sense. In the veter-inary eld in particular, it's important to share thenews of your pregnancy promptly to avoid exposureto many workplace hazards. When you decide to announce the news, make sure your boss is the rstone to know; you want her (or him) to hear itstraight from you, not through the ofce grapevine.Schedule an appointment to tell her that you're ex-pecting and to let her know when your baby is due.Keep your tone positive and upbeat, and don't feel compelled to share any overly personal details.If you are the pregnant owner of a practice, it makessense to share the news with your team fairly earlyfor the same reasons. Generally, folks gure it outpretty quickly on their own anyway, if you changeyour work habits. While it may seem to be tempt-ing fate to share this information so early, it's inyour child's best interest. If you are an employer ofwomen of reproductive age, it is recommended thatyour employee manual state that employees shouldreport their pregnancy to their supervisor as soon aspossible, in order that information about possiblehazards can be shared. Current occupational exposure limits were set based on studies of non-pregnant adults. What isconsidered safe for you may not be safe for yourunborn baby. A fetus may be more vulnerable to 364 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING THE HEALTH OF YOUR PRACTICE AND PERSONNEL NOTESsome chemicals because of its rapid growth and de- velopment, particularly early in pregnancy when itsorgans are developing. Changes in your metabo-lism also may increase how quickly you absorb somesubstances. When pregnant, changes in your im-mune system, lung capacity, and even ligaments canincrease your risk of injury or illness. In addition,because of physical changes, the personal protectiveequipment that you could wear correctly beforepregnancy, such as a lab coat or lead apron, maynow not t properly. It is important to discuss possible job hazards with your physician. Although most women areable to safely do their job throughout pregnancy,sometimes they must adjust their job duties tempo-rarily, or take extra steps to protect themselves andtheir babies. Your ability to continue workingthrough your pregnancy depends on your overallhealth, the health of the fetus, and what sort of workyou do. Many aspects of your job may be safe tocontinue through the entire pregnancy. Othersmay be ne at the beginning of pregnancy, but un-tenable near the end. Later in pregnancy, someduties may need to be changed or stopped. Some-times your schedule or hours may need to bechanged. As you continue working, the goal is tostay safe and comfortable. Specic Risks in Veterinary Medicine Radiation While taking radiographs, you may be exposed to small amounts of radiation. If you work in a mixedpractice, exposure can also occur with use of radio-active iodine treatment for hyperthyroid cats or in ahospital setting with the use of fluoroscopy. Youmay decide to try to eliminate the risk during yourpregnancy by avoiding these duties, but for equinepractitioners, especially in smaller practices, thismay be impossible. If you choose to ask other staffmembers to pick up your radiology duties, it makessense to discuss with your boss if there are otherways that you can still be productive by picking upother tasks. If you are the practice owner, don'texpect others to work longer and harder to do thesetasks for you without some compensatory action.This could be monetary, extra time off, or by youperforming some of their usual tasks. For those who cannot avoid taking radiographs, take steps to reduce the risk. Radiation exposureduring your entire gestation should not exceed 500mrem. The most dangerous time for radiation ex-posure is following conception (pre-implantation) upto the eighth week of pregnancy. 1Many pregnant women wear the same protective equipment whiletaking radiographs as they normally do, includingan apron, thyroid shield, and lead gloves. How-ever, because of changes in body shape, a wrap-around lead apron may be better suited. Inaddition, wearing an additional dosimeter badge atthe level of your uterus can provide more specicmeasurements of exposure to the fetus. If you willbe taking radiographs while pregnant, review thereports from your dosimeter badge for the last yearto ensure that your equipment and radiation safetytechniques are protecting you from excessive expo-sure. As always, keep the time of exposure as shortas possible, maximize your distance behind the gen-erator, or in hospital settings, be out of the room orbehind appropriate shielding. In some equine practices, nuclear scintigraphy is used for diagnostics because of its sensitivity andnoninvasive nature. A 99mTc labeled radiopharma- ceutical is injected intravenously into the horse andimages are acquired immediately post-injection andseveral hours later. Staff members are often in theroom with the horse during the acquisition process.If you must be involved, avoid additional radiationexposure in a clinic with this diagnostic modality bywearing all recommended protective gear, and min-imizing contact with the patient and patient's wastefor 48 hours after the procedure. Waste Anesthetic Gases Waste anesthetic gas (WAG) exposure concerns many pregnant health care workers in human aswell as veterinary medicine. Although a recentmeta-analysis concluded that occupational exposureto WAG is associated with increased risk of sponta-neous abortion, most of the studies included in themeta-analysis were conducted before WAG scaveng-ing had become a legal requirement, and none of thestudies attempted to establish a relationship be-tween amount of exposure and magnitude of risk ofspontaneous abortion. The meta-analysis included19 studies of various designs with anesthetists, op-erating room physicians and nurses, dental assis-tants, operating-room workers, hospital workers,health workers, and veterinarians and veterinaryassistants as subjects. 2More recent studies have demonstrated that \"rates of spontaneous abortionand low birth weight infants were statistically sim-ilar among female veterinarians and lawyers,\" 2 leading one to conclude that WAG is being effec-tively scavenged in most settings. However, if you can smell anesthetic gas, the level is entirely too high for safe exposure, whether youare pregnant or not. Appropriate operating proce-dures for safe anesthesia include always checkingthe machine for leaks before use, ensuring the scav-enging system is connected and operational, andusing a cuffed and properly inflated endotrachealtube. The most dangerous times for exposure areduring induction and recovery. In order to allowtime for the system to be flushed through the scav-enging system, once the procedure is complete, theanesthetic gas should be turned off and the patientmaintained on high oxygen flow. This will help tominimize exhaled WAG after the patient is discon-nected from the anesthesia machine. Vapor respi-rators can also be purchased and worn as an extrabarrier. If possible, swapping with a coworker dur- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 365BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING THE HEALTH OF YOUR PRACTICE AND PERSONNELing the recovery period can decrease your risk of inadvertently being exposed by horses exhaling an-esthetic gases on the way to or while in the recoverystall. Because of the much greater risk of exposurewith mask and box inductions, pregnant employeesin mixed practices who utilize these methods shouldavoid these entirely. Bone Cement Bone cement is the common term for the chemical substance methyl methacrylate (MMA) (also knownas polymethyl methacrylate). Bone cement particularlyin orthopedic or neurology specialty prac-tices. Bone cement is a clear liquid with a veryidentiable sharp and fruity odor. It can be easilydetected at levels far below those considered to beharmful to human health. In equine practice it iscommonly used as a component of an adhesive forgluing on shoes, adding to the bottom of a cast, orrepairing hoof cracks. Toxicity studies performed on animals have had mixed results. Some studies have shown no seriousadverse effects to the fetus. Other studies havefound that pregnant animals exposed to very highlevels of MMA experienced fetal abnormalities.These abnormalities included birth defects, issueswith bone growth, and an overall decline in fetalweight. Because MMA carries a potential risk ofharm to a human fetus, it is commonly advised thatpregnant women avoid direct contact with MMA andinhalation of MMA fumes. 3 Pharmaceuticals Some drugs prescribed to veterinary patients are dan- gerous for pregnant women to handle. Common ex-amples are diethylstilbestrol, chloramphenicol,misoprostol, cyclosporine, altrenogest a, and dinoprost tromethamine.b Diethylstilbestrol is a synthetic female hormone that is used to treat urinary incontinence in spayedfemale dogs and was widely prescribed for pregnantwomen from the 1930s to 1960s but was later foundto increase cancer risk in babies that were exposed. 4 While there are few literature reports linking the use of chloramphenicol in pregnancy to birthdefects, it has been associated with adverse effectsin the neonate as well as heritable genetic damageand cancer. 5In addition, and fatal hypoplastic therapy. Chloram-phenicol-associated aplastic anemia terminating inleukemia has also been reported. 6 Misoprostol may cause adverse effects on the de- veloping fetus, miscarriage, uterine rupture, bleed-ing, and death. 7 Cyclosporine is an immunomodulatory drug used to treat an increasing spectrum of diseases in dogs.It is associated with premature delivery and lowbirth weight in human infants. 8Altrenogest is an oral progestin used to suppress estrus or as an adjunct to help maintain pregnancyin mares. Skin contact must be avoided as altreno-gest is readily absorbed through unbroken skin.The product label warns that pregnant women orwomen who suspect they are pregnant should nothandle this product, as accidental absorption couldlead to prolongation of pregnancy. 9 Dinoprost tromethamine is used for estrus induc- tion and synchronization in farm animals andhorses. It is readily absorbed through the skin andcan cause abortion in pregnant women. 10 These are not the only pharmaceuticals that can cause harm. Use care, read labels, and avoid han-dling hazardous substances as much as possible.If you do handle these drugs while pregnant, usedouble gloves or consider wearing thicker chemo-therapy gloves. Wash your hands thoroughly andconsider wearing a mask if handling tablets thatcould result in dust inhalation. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is designed to ght cancer by killing fast-growing cells. Hence, these cytotoxic drugsare very harmful to the fetus's fast-growing cells.Ideally, pregnant women shouldn't interact with pa-tients receiving chemotherapy or be involved in itsadministration. If there is no alternative, at leasttry to avoid the preparation of chemotherapy agents,the mixing of IV fluids containing chemotherapeuticagents and the injection or inltration of tissueswith these drugs, such as the injection of an equinesarcoid with cisplatin. Wear a gown and mask, aswell as double chemotherapy gloves when perform-ing treatments, if you must perform this service. The waste of patients receiving chemotherapy is often toxic for a period of time as it is eliminatedfrom the body. To the extent possible, let othersperform clean-up of these patients' cages or stalls.Because certain chemotherapeutic agents are moredangerous than others, it is prudent to learn asmuch as you can about these drugs before handlingthem, if you're pregnant. Formaldehyde and Formalin Formalin is the name for saturated (37%) formalde- hyde solution. Study results vary with regard tothe degree of risk that formaldehyde can pose forpregnant women, but it is known to be a carcinogen,and is linked to spontaneous abortion, congenitalmalformations, and premature birth. Pregnancy isa particularly vulnerable time for exposure to indoorair pollutants such as formaldehyde. Avoiding con-tact with formaldehyde and formalin is wise duringpregnancy. Toxoplasmosis Most pregnant women are aware of the dangers of toxoplasmosis. The feces of cats may contain a par-asite called Toxoplasma gondii , which can cause the rare but serious blood infection. Toxoplasmosis can 366 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: MANAGING THE HEALTH OF YOUR PRACTICE AND PERSONNELalso be contracted by eating infected, undercooked meat or by eating contaminated fruit or vegetables.Interestingly, the most frequent exposure to toxo-plasmosis is by eating undercooked pork. If you have lived with cats for some length of time, work in a small animal practice, or have eaten un-dercooked pork, you may have already been exposedto toxoplasmosis and developed immunity to it.Pregnant employees may choose to be serologicallytested, because with a seropositive result, they arenot at risk of contracting the protozoa. For womenwho are not immune to toxoplasmosis, exposure tothis parasite just prior to or during pregnancy maycause the fetus to be infected. According to theOrganization of Teratology Information Services,when infection occurs between weeks 10 to 24, therisk for severe problems in the newborn is about 5%to 6%. Effects on the baby include premature birth,low birth weight, fever, jaundice, abnormalities ofthe retina, mental retardation, abnormal head size,convulsions, and brain calcication. During thethird trimester, a fetus has an increased risk ofbecoming infected, but the risk of damage to thefetus is decreased since most of the important devel-opment has already occurred. 11 During pregnancy, if you do not have immunity, allow other people to clean litter boxes. It is alwayswise to take sanitary precautions when handlinglitter boxes, even if you aren't pregnant. In addi-tion, washing your hands thoroughly between han-dling patients (as you probably already do) is simplygood biosecurity and good personal hygiene. Other Zoonotic or Infectious Diseases Exposure to or infection with diseases like rabies, tetanus, C. difcile diarrhea, listeriosis, and Q fever have all been docu-mented in veterinary workers. Pregnant womenare more susceptible to certain zoonotic infectionsowing to physiologic suppression of cell-mediatedimmunity. Conditions to include choriomeningitis, brucellosis, listeriosis,and psittacosis. transmission of certainzoonotic agents may result in miscarriage, still-birth, premature birth, or fetal congenital anom-alies. The NASPHV Compendium of VeterinaryStandard Precautions is recommended as a re-source to minimize these hazards. 12In addition, the University of Wisconsin has a Web page de-voted to zoonoses and pregnancy. 13 3. Summary Educate yourself about the specic risks in yourworkplace. Discuss these risks with your obstetri-cian and your concerns with the practice owner soonafter you nd out you're pregnant. There will bemany decisions to make, some of which will be dif-cult, but the detrimental effect of failing to takeprecautions could cause a lifetime of difculty foryour child. Together with your employer and phy-sician, you can decide whether you need to takespecial precautions or modify your work duties dur-ing your pregnancy. You need to feel comfortablewith your choices. Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of Veteri- nary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Introduction While the administration of therapeutic substances is necessary for effective treatment of equine ath-letes, equally as important is ensuring the safetyand welfare of the horse. This includes assuringthat injuries, which would otherwise keep a horsefrom racing, are not \"masked\" by the administrationof drugs. To that end, the use of therapeutic com-pounds in racehorses is tightly regulated. Whilethe oversight bodies differ depending on the disci-pline, the goal of medication monitoring and anti-doping programs remain the same. First, these programs are meant to ensure the safety and wel-fare of the horse and jockey; second, to ensure a fairand level playing eld/maintain the integrity of theindustry and third, in the case of horseracing, tosafeguard the public where pari-mutuel wagering exists. In horse racing, many racing jurisdictions in North America have adopted the National UniformMedication Program (NUMP) recommendations, a setof regulatory recommendations (thresholds andwithdrawal times) for therapeutic medications meantto encourage uniformity throughout the industry.These recommendations are made by the Racing Med-ication and Testing Consortium (RMTC) to the Asso-ciation of Racing Commissioners International (RCI) who then votes to incorporate them into the NUMP.In 2015, the American Association of Equine Practi-tioners (AAEP) announced that the organization fullysupports the adoption and implantation of NUMP inall racing jurisdictions as part of the AAEP's Prescrip-tion for Racing Reform. 1As discussed in more detail below for specic classes of therapeutic medications,recently some racing jurisdictions within the UnitedStates have begun to adopt/implement stricter medi-cation regulations that are more in line with interna-tional standards. 2. Therapeutic Medications Used in Racehorses While certainly not an all-inclusive list, what followsis a discussion of a few of the more commonly usedtherapeutic substances in racehorses, including thosethat have been of concern as of late. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)remain the mainstay of treatment for horses withmusculoskeletal pain and inflammation and as suchare arguably the most commonly prescribed medica-tion in racetrack practice. These drugs are potentanti-inflammatory drugs by virtue of their ability to 368 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: MEDICATION AND THERAPEUTICS FOR RACEHORSES NOTESdecrease production eicosanoids of that have a greater selectivity for COX-2,which is oftentimes associated with the signs of in-flammation, relative to COX-1, the so-called house-keeping enzyme, are considered to have a bettersafety prole. There are currently six US Food andDrug Administration (FDA)-approved NSAIDs la-beled for agents, they vary with re-spect to their COX-1:COX-2 selectivity, as well aspharmacokinetics properties. While the use of this class of drugs is unarguably imperative in veterinary medicine for the effectivetreatment of pain and inflammation in equine pa-tients, it is important that they be used judiciouslyin racehorses. As a result of their potential to maskinjuries during racing or interfere with detection oflameness during pre-competition tness and lame-ness examinations, the use of NSAIDs is highly reg-ulated in racehorses. With respect to pre-racinglameness evaluations, the examination may occur as many as 14 hours prior to post time and thereforeconcerns have been raised with respect to the regu-latory examining veterinarian's ability to effectivelyconduct an examination if PBZ is administeredat 24 hours prior to racing (the current recommen-dation under the NUMP). In 2015, the AAEPrecommended to the RMTC, a 48-hour restrictedadministration time for NSAIDs as part of NUMP,citing research supporting anti-inflammatoryeffects lasting beyond 24-hours and emphasizing theneed to evaluate horses without the effect of anti-inflammatory drugs effecting this decision. Al-though not yet part of NUMP, within the last year, select racing jurisdictions have adopted a 48-hourstand-down time for NSAIDs. \"Stacking\" of NSAIDs is a practice employed by some racetrack practitioners. As only one NSAIDis permitted within 24 hours under NUMP, in thisscenario, a \"secondary threshold\" with a 48-hourwithdrawal time exists for the second NSAID. Ad-ministration of multiple NSAIDs in close proximitydoes appear to prolong the inflammatory effect in anex vivo model, assessing the effects of administration of multiple NSAIDs, specically flunixin meglumineand PBZ on the production of inflammatory media-tors in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated blood. a Aside from the prolonged anti-inflammatory effects,from an animal welfare standpoint, it should also benoted that multiple NSAIDs may increase the risk ofand/or compound the adverse effects (i.e., gastriculcers) associated with administration of drugs inthis class. In keeping with stricter regulations onthe administration of NSAIDs in horseracing, theRMTC has recently recommended eliminating thesecondary threshold to help end the practice of\"stacking\" of NSAIDs and this recommendation has already been adopted by some racing jurisdiction. Corticosteroids Similar to NSAIDs, the effectiveness of corticoste-roids in the treatment of musculoskeletal and jointpain and inflammation make them particularly use- ful in racetrack practice. These extremely potentanti-inflammatory agents are administered by bothintra-articular and systemic (IV, IM, and PO) routesof administration. Intra-articular corticosteroidsare oftentimes formulated as esters (i.e., acetate,acetonide), prolonging the residence time in thejoint. In order for the drug to elicit its pharmaco-logic effect, the corticosteroid must be liberated fromthe ester by enzymes present within the joint. Asthis process takes time, formulating these drugs asesters, gives them the properties of a \"slow-release\"formulation. Sim ilarly, in order for the drug to leave the joint and enter the systemic circulation, itmust be free from the ester group. With respectto exiting the joint, the corticosteroid leaves veryslowly, resulting in a disproportionately high con-centration of drug in the joint compared to what isdetected in the blood. This suggests that the phar-macologic effect in the joint is also prolonged and thelow to non-detectable levels of corticosteroid in theblood are not a good indicator of what is occurring inthe joint. In one study with methylprednisolone acetate, concentrations of drug in the joint weredetected for 70-77 days post administration, longafter drug concentrations were below detectable lev-els in the blood. 2This nding supports previous research, which demonstrates prolonged therapeu-tic effects for most of the commonly used intra-articular corticosteroids. 3 Corticosteroid administration, both intra-articular and systemic, are tightly regulated in horseracing.Current recommendations under the NUMP is thattriamcinolone acetonide, isoflupredone acetate and be-tamethasone be administered a minimum of 7 daysprior to racing and methylprednisolone acetate at 21days. Some racing jurisdictions, at the recommenda-tion of the RMTC have extended the intra-articularadministration time for triamcinolone acetonide, isof-lupredone acetate, and betamethasone to 14-daystand-down the RMTC recom-mends prohibition of corticosteroid stacking, wherebythe presence of more than one corticosteroid would beconsidered a violation. Furosemide Perhaps one of the most controversial topics in horseracing, both nationally and internationally, is theuse of race day furosemide. Furosemide is admin-istered to decrease the severity of bleeding associ-ated with exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage(EIPH), which has a reported incidence of 43% to75% in Thoroughbred horses when examined within2 hours of racing. 4-7 AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. RACEHORSESStudies of pharmacological interventions for EIPH have focused primarily on decreasing the severity of hemorrhage and to date, the only pharmacologicintervention that attenuates the bleeding associatedwith EIPH is furosemide. 8While the mechanism of action is still unclear, furosemide has been shown toattenuate the increases in pulmonary pressures as-sociated with strenuous exercise, thus decreasingthe severity or incidence of EIPH. 8,9 Due to the high incidence of EIPH in racehorses and the potential impact in the short term on ath-letic performance and over the long term on theanimals' health, in many North American racingjurisdictions, furosemide administration is permit-ted as a preventative measure for EIPH up to 4hours prior to post time, making furosemide the onlypermitted race-day medication. Recently, manyracing jurisdictions are re-examining the allowanceof race day furosemide. Two studies describing theeffects of furosemide, administered 24 hours prior torace, on EIPH scores and red blood cell counts inbronchoalveolar lavage fluid had mixed re- sults. 10,11One study conducted at the racetrack using horses in active race training failed to demon-strate a signicant difference in EIPH scores or redblood cell in bronchoalveolar lavage fluidwhen furosemide administered at 24hours and a saline control. 10It should be noted that the EIPH history of horses enrolled in thatstudy was unknown and the authors suggested per-haps the outcome would have been different hadhorses with a known history of EIPH been utilized. 10 In the second study, investigators assessed the ef-fects of six different treatment protocols, including different doses of furosemide and with and without water restrictions, on the mitigation of EIPH inhorses when the drug was administered 24 hoursprior to treadmill and racetrack exercise. 11Of the six treatment protocols, a combination of 0.5 mg/kgfurosemide, administered at 24 hours prior to stren-uous exercise in combination with water restriction(6 mL/kg at 20, 16, 12, and 8 hours prior to exercise)decreased the severity of EIPH. 11It should be noted that the authors also recommended that alarger study is indicated to fully evaluate thisprotocol. While currently, many racing jurisdictions do still permit race day (outside of 4 hours prior to posttime) administration of furosemide, some have re-stricted its use starting with horses turning 2 yearsold in 2020. Additionally, the AAEP has supportedinvestigation of alternative management strategiesfor EIPH with the intent of eliminating race-dayadministration of furosemide should a more efca-cious strategy become apparent. Bisphosphonates Bisphosphonates are potent anti-resorptive agentsthat have been used for several years in humanmedicine to increase bone density and decrease frac-ture risk in individuals with osteoporosis. 12-15In2014, the FDA approved two bisphosphonate prod-ucts for use in veterinary medicine, labeled for thetreatment of navicular syndrome in horses greaterthan 4 years of age. Prior to this time, bisphospho-nates were used in horses in an extra label fashionfor conditions such as back soreness, 16hock osteo- arthritis,17and navicular disease.18 Despite the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine not recommending the use of bisphosphonates inhorses less than 4 years of age, 19anecdotal reports exist of its use in this age group. While there are nopublished reports describing the effects of bisphos-phonates on the skeleton of growing horses becausethey are known to inhibit osteoclasts and osteoclastsplay a role in bone development, 20inhibition by bi- sphosphonates may have detrimental effects on nor-mal bone development. Furthermore, as has beenreported in young human athletes, 21the adverse effects of bisphosphonates on bone in juvenile horsesmay be exacerbated if these young horses are under-going high-impact exercise, such as race training. The use of bisphosphonates in racehorses, regard- less of age, is controversial. 22One argument in favor of their use is that because bisphosphonatesare known to inhibit the effects of osteoclasts, thatadministration may prevent weakening of bone andthus the occurrence of stress fractures. 22However, in Thoroughbred racehorses microcracks are knownto occur as part of high-intensity training, 23and the rst step in the healing process is resorption, whichis mediated by osteoclasts. 24It would then follow that bisphosphonates, through inhibition of bone re-sorption, may impair the normal healing process.An additional proposed mechanism of bisphospho-nate activity is inhibition of osteocytes which play arole in osteoclast recruitment, further reducing theability of the body to repair microcracks, 21,25there- fore adding to bone fragility. While not specicallyrelated to the healing of microcracks, studies in miceand rats have demonstrated a delay in remodeling ofthe cartilaginous callus in fractures when animalswere treated with bisphosphonates. 26-30 It has been well established in humans that al- though BPs have a short residence (and detection)time in blood that they can remain in bone formonths to years. 31Recently, bisphosphonates were detected in bone and teeth from horses administeredeither clodronate or tiludronate at 4 and 30 daysprior to collection of samples. bUsing a liquid chro- matography-tandem mass spectrometry assay, bothbisphosphonates were detected in the right and leftmolar, right and left radius, right MC3 and righttuber coxae, providing the rst evidence that similarto humans, BPs reside in horse bone for extendedperiods of time post administration potentially pro-longing the duration of effect and inhibiting boneremodeling in young athletic animals. Bisphosphonates also reportedly have analgesic effects. While the exact mechanism for this anal-gesic effect has not been denitely determined, somehave theorized that it is due to either direct inter- 370 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: MEDICATION AND pain associ- ated with active bone resorption.25One group of researchers have proposed that type 5 acid phospha- tase (TRAcP5b), a marker of subchondral osteoclastactivity, 33may also be an indicator of bone pain associated with osteoclast behavior in individualswith osteoarthritis. 33One study in humans dem- onstrated a signicant the bis- phosphonate alendronate. 34In horses, there are anecdotal reports of analgesic effects lasting up to 30days. Both clodronate and etidronate have beenshown to have analgesic effects in mice. 32 Due to concerns regarding the use of bisphospho- nates in young animals in active training, wherebone development and remodeling are of great impor- tance, some racing jurisdictions have adopted a policyprohibiting the use of this class of drugs in racehorses.Additional research on bisphosphonates in horses isneeded to fully understand the effects on bone remod-eling and development. 3. Concluding Remarks Judicious use of therapeutic substances in racetrackpractice is imperative to ensure the safety of equineathletes and regulatory recommendations aremeant to aid the practitioner in this endeavor.Regulatory thresholds for therapeutic drugs are setat a concentration in which the drug has no or min-imal pharmacologic effect and that which can beeffectively regulated. In many North Americanracing jurisdictions, a pharmacokinetic study is conducted, and a statistical approach is then used toestablish a withdrawal time that is representative ofthe time that drug concentrations will fall below thethreshold value, plus a statistical margin of safety. 35 When utilizing these recommendations, it is impor-tant to note that they are based on a specic drugformulation, route of administration and dosage andtherefore if treatment deviates, it may be necessaryto extend the withdrawal time accordingly. It isalso imperative that the treating veterinarian do hisor her own risk assessment based on relevant clini-cal factors and that the regulatory recommendationbe adjusted accordingly. Lastly, the preceding discussion includes only a small subset of therapeutic drugs used in racetrackpractice, and discussion of additional therapeuticmedications, including regulatory recommenda-tions, can be found elsewhere.

Introduction In North America, professional horse racing is entirely regulated by the individual states. Eachstate has legal authority over pari-mutuel wagering,by which all bets of a certain category are placedtogether in a pool; excise taxes and the house share(i.e., margin) are deducted from the winning bets.The original intent of funds collected from pari-mutuel excise taxes were to support rural andagricultural economy. As a consequence, equinedrug testing/anti-doping regulations are controlledthrough adopting Model Rules and by redrafting therule language to ensure these are suitable for indi-vidual states. Each state has its own legislature,therefore each jurisdiction may have different re-quirements for changes to Model Rule language.For example, some state guidelines are statuteswhile other states use regulations. Statutes arelaws made by the legislature and regulations/rules are adopted by Commissions/Boards to ll in thegaps of legislation. State codes are books wheresimilar subjects (statutes/laws) are grouped to-gether. Regardless, each process has unique re-quirements when notifying the public of any rulechange; additionally, there are built-in timelines per state law for approving and enacting these changes.There are numerous examples where these differentprocesses create delays in Model Rule implementa-tion, and frequently there are unintended languagediscrepancies between states. Currently, standardized methods for equine anti-doping laboratories do not exist. All Racing Medication and Testing Consortium-accredited lab- oratories perform the initial testing procedure orscreening of performance-enhancing drugs usingboth gas chromatography and liquid chromatogra-phy, coupled with mass spectrometry. In general,these nontargeted techniques acquire the essentialdata to monitor large numbers of substances. Indoing so, they provide coverage for nearly all prohib-ited pharmaceuticals. In most jurisdictions, urineand blood samples are analyzed using advanced LC-high-resolution accurate mass spectrometry, LC-HRMS, ato acquire the necessary data for small- molecule drug detection. LC-HRMS is now themost important screening technique used in equineanti-doping laboratories. Personnel training iscritical as typical processing involves manual as- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 373IN-DEPTH: MEDICATION AND THERAPEUTICS FOR RACEHORSES NOTESsessment of thousands of data les, requiring signif- icant personnel time to review and evaluateindividual chromatograms and spectra per le. 2. Dene Roles of the Anti-Doping Laboratory Horseracing anti-doping programs test for more sub-stances and at lower limits of detection than anyprofessional or amateur sport, including the Olym-pics. While racing establishments may logicallyconsider the racing chemist only in relation to rou-tine analysis of urine and blood samples, the impres-sive amount of research work also carried out eachyear should not be overlooked. It is true that theprimary function of the racing laboratory is theroutine testing of pre- and post-race samples. How-ever, before this can be efciently accomplished, many months of carefully organized research andvalidated work have to be completed by qualiedscientists. Equine pharmacology is an under- funded discipline in veterinary medicine. Of late,resources previously dedicated to support exercisedhorses for targeted projects have been substantiallydecreased or eliminated entirely. The most produc-tive research conducted in equine pharmacology in-volve well-designed studies, precise execution andcomprehensive data analysis. The administrationof drug targets to university-owned research horsesis the foundation for obtaining accurate pharmaco-kinetic and pharmacodynamic information. Onlythen can research samples be effectively utilized forimproving extraction methods, increasing sensitiv-ity of techniques, developing methods for new drugs,and adapting new instruments to this highly spe-cialized type of analysis. Monitoring Medication Usage of Racing Population Analytical Capabilities and When to Use the MostSensitive Method One of the primary responsibilities of racing of- cials charged with the regulation of racing is toensure that the sport is conducted without any ille-gal external influence and with impartial judgment.This responsibility is shared to some degree by ev-eryone involved in racing and all those interested inthe continued well-being of racing as a sport and abusiness. Foremost among these responsibilities isthe prevention of prohibited practices and the de-tection and punishment of those misguided per-sons whose decisions may compromise the sport'sintegrity. Few of these practices are more detri-mental to racing in the eyes of the public than theuse of a drug with the intention of altering theperformance of a horse during a race. It followsthat those concerned with the reputation of racingand with its honest conduct can leave no method,which offers promise of providing an effectiveweapon against those determined to cheat,unexplored. The concept of threshold values for therapeutic substances was introduced in the early 1990s. TheCalifornia Horse Racing Board authorized \"decisionlevels\" for 8 therapeutic medications. In the past 3decades, racing authorities have employed differentapproaches to doping control of therapeutic medica-tions. There are 4 basic ideological approaches; 1)zero tolerance, 2) permitted medication (thresholds),3) screening limits, and 4) restricted administrationtime. Prior to development of thresholds for ther-apeutic medications, veterinarians and equine phar-macologists had their own opinions about agentsand their effects on performance. Creating theconcept and framework for evaluating therapeuticthresholds has provided a useful foundation for ex-change of knowledge among experts, as well as valu-able information for horsemen and regulators. Zero tolerance, terminology often embraced by laymen, is an old approach used widely in Europe.This approach implies that the qualitative detectionand conrmation of a prohibited substance would beall that is required to invoke the rule. In general,there is no reference to any quantiable concentra-tion, thereby making it immaterial if the substanceis present in milligrams, nanograms, or femtogramsper milliliter. The inherent problems are evidentbut not limited to the following: 1) naturally occur-ring substances (e.g., morphine and scopolamine), 2)prolonged elimination times for some therapeuticmedications, 3) limited information regarding newtherapeutic medications, and 4) variable methodol-ogies/capabilities between laboratories. More re-cently, the majority of regulatory agencies havecome to the realization that zero tolerance is scien-tically and morally flawed with regard to manysubstances. Permitted medications is often the term associ- ated with therapeutic medications with a detectiontime exceeding the pharmacological effects mostassociated with a therapeutic dose. With thisapproach, the regulatory body establishes a \"thresh-old\" concentration, which is determined from phar-macokinetic studies. Concentrations in regulatorysamples that exceed the threshold concentrationwould then be considered a violation. The term, screening limit, is the concentration of a particular therapeutic substance in urine or plasma,above which the racing laboratory would report thesample as being positive. This ideology is usedthroughout the world but is particularly popular inEurope and Asia. This approach doesn't requirethe laboratory to report a measured concentration.The racing chemist would only need to establishthat the sample contains a therapeutic substanceabove the screening limit prior to conducting nalconrmatory analysis. The nal conrmation doesnot require quantitation analysis. Analytical chemists require guidance with respect to chemical agents with the potential for abuse andtherefore that are of the highest priority for methoddevelopment. In addition, the racing laboratoriesrequire guidance on establishing detection level(sometimes referred to as \"threshold,\" \"reporting 374 2020 /H11408Vol. RACEHORSESlimit,\" or \"screening limit\") necessary to control mis- use of legitimate therapeutic drugs. With inputfrom stakeholders and veterinary experts, the rac-ing authorities establish the proper \"limit\" neededto prevent threats to racing that involve improperadministration of drugs. Once the guidelines areissued, the laboratories are then responsible for se-lecting and applying the analytical method requiredto best verify compliance. In these cases, the labsuse the fully validated quantitative methods re-viewed and approved by an external accreditingorganization. Sample Analysis is a 2-Step Procedure Initially, all samples undergo a multi-stage solid phase extraction procedure, followed by analysis us-ing numerous screening methods. These screeningmethods most often employ chromatography sepa- ration coupled with mass-spectrometry detection.This combination affords simultaneous identica-tion of thousands of compounds while providinglimits of detection in the low parts-per-trillion con-centration. These extraordinary sensitivities areadvantageous for detecting prohibited substanceswhich have no therapeutic purpose in horse racing.However, if interpreted incorrectly, such as in thecase of therapeutic drugs, these highly sensitivetools can result in positive ndings days to weeksbeyond any pharmacological effect. To avoid irrel-evant ndings for therapeutic medications, compre-hensive standard operating procedures and methodvalidation must be routine in all racing chemistrylaboratories. A properly dened workflow includ-ing sample preparation, sample analysis, and dataprocessing to meet predened criteria are a mini-mum requirement. High-resolution accurate mass spectrometry is particularly important for biological samples thatinvolve complex matrix (e.g., urine and blood).Full-scan approaches permit detection of unlimitednumbers of analytes simultaneously. For a screen-ing method aiming at detection of both targetanalytes and unknowns, high-resolution instrumen-tation is a distinct advantage. Conrmation The use of mass spectrometry for conrmatory anal- ysis is mandatory in order to report a therapeuticexcess or prohibited substance nding, in effectmaking this technique the gold standard for legallydefensible data. The analytical technique of massspectrometry is a measure of the mass-to-charge(m/z) ratio of ions, with the ratio of the analytesignal to the noise measured with a blank (back-ground). Contemporary mass spectrometers canoperate in modes that provide very low backgroundnoise and have the ability to detect individual ions,enabling the extreme lower limits of detection (fem-tograms /H110051/H1100310 /H1100215grams).Limit of Detection and Limit of Quantitation The limit of detection for analytical procedures is the endpoint of achievable determination by sta-tistical based measurement of the target analytewhere the signal-to-noise is no less than 3:1. Thelimit of quantitation is the achievable determinationby statistical-based measurement of the target ana-lyte where the signal-to-noise is no less than 10:1.When samples are analyzed the resultant data mustbe evaluated to determine whether the therapeuticmedication is found and if administered within theparameters set by the method validation studies. Method Validation In common with human testing laboratories, the racing industry requires quantitative methods toestablish the concentration of an analyte relative toa scientically determined threshold medication.These quantitative methods must be validated usingpredened acceptance criteria to characterize anddocument performance limitations. Experimentaldata must be collected to evaluate for accuracy, limitof detection, limit of quantitation, linearity, preci-sion, range, and specicity per US Food and DrugAdministration-recommended guidelines. In addi-tion, it is a requirement of all quantitative methodsto estimate the measurement of uncertainty for theprocedure at the threshold value. Measurement ofuncertainty is used when reporting the range ofpossible values within which the true value of themeasurement lies. Combining these validationsteps enhances the integrity of the analytical pro-cesses and provides assurance to stakeholders re-garding the reported ndings. 3. New Emerging Trends/Threats Proteins/Peptide A wide range of unregulated peptide-based drugs are now available through the internet with numer-ous Web sites offering an innite array of purportedperformance poor drugs but they theoretically can makegood doping agents. Peptides have poor bioavailability due to their low diffusion rate across cell membranes. They arerapidly degraded by endogenous proteases/pepti-dases, rapidly secreted by the kidneys and exhibitshort half-lives after administration. All of thesecharacteristics make peptides a challenge to detectin biological samples. The bulk of these products are intended to stimu- late cellular processes or mimic the effects of endog-enous equine growth hormone, subsequently tobuild muscle, bone strength and speed recovery frominjuries. The majority of the peptide products com- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 375IN-DEPTH: MEDICATION AND THERAPEUTICS FOR RACEHORSESmercially available are untested but nonetheless en- dorsed through anecdotal statements posted onlinesuggesting they have many different applications,including to increase muscle mass, decrease fat,decrease injury recovery time, restore structuralmaladies, stimulate glucose uptake, and treat acute/chronic illness. The ample supply of these com-pounds provides unrestricted access to anabolicpeptides for abuse by dishonest trainers. Biological emerging threats are listed below: 1. Equine somatotrophin\u2014Elevate insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and binding protein 3 (IGFBP3)production. 2. GH-releasing hormones (GHRH)\u2014elevate GH production. 3. GH-releasing peptides\u2014Mimics GHRH production. The ideal goal, to counter these illegal biologicalagents, would be to understand the specic cellularprocesses that are affected when the drugs are ad-ministered to the horses. To achieve this goal, thebiology of the drug class needs to be understood.This is often done through the study of interactionnetworks. The studies to establish effect must beperformed on a large cohort to evaluate each bio-marker's specicity. Then, an initial screeningmethod could be used to identify ideal biomarkercandidates without having to know the specic drug(within a class) that was administered. The bio-marker screening would include a specic panel oftargets (proteins in known pathways) from the en-tire equine proteome and indicate critical changesby identifying up/down regulation from what is con-sidered the baseline proteome. Biotherapeutics Over the past 15 to 20 years, biological therapeutics have become a large portion of the pharmaceuticaland biotech drug development pipelines. The num-ber and variety of new, large molecule therapeuticswill continue to increase in the next decade. Thehuman market has many biotherapeutics targetingarthritis, inflammation, and pain that are all localtargets for equine biotherapeutic molecules. Thisexpansion in the human eld has led to a surge intherapeutics in specialized veterinary disciplines.Canine and feline oncology have already made prog-ress with the introduction of numerous species-specic therapeutics. The market is much smaller,but the global players in equine healthcare are activelyadding new drugs into their development pipeline. Large molecules present unique challenges for anti-doping laboratories. Unlike the detection ofsmall molecules, which are often based on theirphysical and chemical characteristics, biotherapeu-tics frequently require extensive clean-up proce-dures consisting of tryptic digestion and/orimmunochemical methodologies, such as Further complicating matters, large-molecule therapeutics often have endogenous coun-terparts in matrix (e.g., erythropoietin). The size ofthe analytical molecule (molecular weight) alonepresents an obstacle very different than small-molecule drugs. For example, some biologics areproduced by cell culture, and each batch generatesunique outcomes; therefore, individual productionlots will vary slightly in terms of the molecularstructure, which will affect the end products. Con-sequently, analytical method validation must belinked to reference materials prior to validation ex-periments, making the traceability of referencestandards even more important. Genetic Practices (Gene Editing/Gene Doping) Gene editing is a type of gene engineering, whereby DNA is inserted, deleted, modied, or replacedwithin the genome of a living organism. Gene ed-iting is most commonly considered within the realmof gene therapy research, with the aim of curingdisease by altering malfunctional genes. To date,over 2300 gene therapy clinical trials have beencompleted in humans focused on the treatment ofcancer and cardiovascular disease. However, likepharmacological therapies, gene therapy has the po-tential for misuse, specically to enhance perfor-mance in athletes. This has been recognized as arisk to human sports for approximately the last 15years. Gene doping poses a signicant threat to theintegrity of horseracing, and without the develop-ment of new methods, will go undetected. Whenviral vectors carrying genes encoding certain pro-teins are introduced into cells of the equine athlete,those cells will begin to produce these proteins. The cell will use endogenous components to pro-duce these proteins, making the products virtuallyindistinguishable from their endogenous counter-parts. The most frequently used technique is the so-called CRISPR/Cas9-system, which has fasttracked a wide variety of applications including ba-sic biological research and the development of newtherapeutics. Developing analytical methods to de-tect gene doping has been particularly slow andproblematic since both the doping gene and the pro-tein produced are likely highly homologous, if notidentical, to their organically occurring counter-parts. To overcome this imminent threat, novelmethods must be developed, such as monitoring thenumber of copies of gene within the cell. Baselinedata from genetically unmanipulated horses shouldbe collected, and the \"normal\" number of copies foreach gene of interest should be predetermined.Candidate genes that may be targeted would likelyinclude those which 1) induce desirable changes inthe muscle phenotype to increase strength and im-prove sprinting ability, 2) may increase oxygen de-livery or blood flow to working muscles for enhancedcapability, 3) alleviate pain to resist fatigue andimprove post-race recovery, and 4) target mentalaptitude, e.g., 376 PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: MEDICATION AND THERAPEUTICS FOR RACEHORSESThe real challenge is with the Biotech industry and their aggressive growth strategies to identify newgene targets. While only a small number of thesemolecules will become US Food and Drug Adminis-tration-approved drugs, the potential misuse of theremaining unapproved candidates presents a bigchallenge to the racing industry. Phytotherapy (Herbal Medicine) Phytotherapy is the use of plant extracts or prepa- rations containing active drugs from plant origin(e.g., cannabidiol [CBD]). Approximately, between40% to 50% of pharmaceuticals registered for hu-man use are natural products or derived from anatural product. Well-known examples include as-pirin, atropine, cocaine, digoxin morphine, and qui-nine. Racing laboratories recognized the need todetermine a threshold for substances of dietary ori-gin, even before thresholds were established fortherapeutic medication. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) expert panel determined that CBD oil was not a cannabimi-metic, and therefore is not prohibited under theWADA Code. Conversely, the following year, theUnited States Equestrian Federation (USEF) an-nounced they would prohibit CBD and all related cannabinoids. They stated CBD and its activemetabolites are likely to affect the performance ofa horse due to their reported anxiolytic effects.They further noted that CBD is only one of 113cannabinoid molecules that scientists have identi-ed. Some estimate there could be a 100 or moreundiscovered cannabinoids. USEF's position isthat any horse competing under USEF rules foundto have any form of a natural cannabinoid, syntheticcannabinoid and other cannabimimetic in their sys-tem at the time of competition will be in violation oftheir rules. The use of herbal remedies (e.g., dietary supple- ments) is prevalent in humans, due in part to theprohibitive cost of many prescribed pharmaceuti-cals. Frequently referred to as \"nutraceuticals,\"equine dietary supplements are widely used andoften viewed as a required part of equine welfare.While these products are rarely harmful in theirintended form, many people presume that supple-ments are safer than drugs. In spite of this belief,there have been numerous cases when wrongly for-mulated or contaminated supplements have causedpositive drug tests in racehorses. Several ndingsof xanthine alkaloids (e.g., caffeine, theophylline,theobromine) have been reported and were attrib-uted to nutritional supplements bor feed contamina- tion (e.g., bakery biproducts). There have beennumerous positive reports of ephedrine that wereattributed to herbal products containing Ephedra. One product, cresulted in 9 positive cases in Califor- nia. Other examples include the use of Chineseherbal remedies at racetracks. These products arenot permitted since they are potential sources ofdrug violation largely because of the lack of regula-tion of the facilities used in the manufacturing process. Implement Out-of-Competition Testing Protocol (Industry \"Best Practices\") Various means have been proposed for the purpose of keeping a horse off the track that has been givena drug. Several approaches for out-of-competitiontesting prior to the race have been implemented inmany states, many of which have been met withsubstantial resistance from horsemen's organiza-tions. Any pre-race test of this sort, to be practical,must conform to certain requirements. First, sincethe results will be used to prevent horses from com-peting in races for which they have been entered, thetest must be accurate, validated, and legally defend-able. No innocent trainer will accept having theirhorse scratched because of the \"possible\" presence ofa drug, and they would justiably resent the implicitsmear on their reputation and character. There-fore, any out-of-competition testing method result-ing in regulatory action must be capable of detectingand identifying the drug beyond reproach. Train-ers utilizing performance enhancing-substances toalter outcomes, create an unfair advantage and un-dermine the condence in the competitors and thesport. The end goal is to protect horse racingevents by creating the strongest possible deterrentto prevent competitors from any improper behavior. 4. Concluding Remarks Medication Uniformity Throughout North America The existing equine drug testing industry has struggled for many years to maintain effectiveanti-doping programs throughout the UnitedStates. The allocation of testing funds each statereceives has been unchanged for many years.As a result, inflation results in rapidly decliningrelative funding. In addition, there has been noadditional funding for most states' mandated test-ing or new testing technologies, and funding forresearch or quality improvement is inadequate.Consequently, several equine labs have not beenable to invest in updated facilities or equipment,resulting in deciencies reported by external au-ditors and delayed accreditation. One mushrooming criticism of horse racing in the United States is that there is no centralized regula-tory organization. As discussed previously, one ar-gument is that since each state has control of its ownmedication regulations, uniformity for testing and enforcement will never occur, and therefore the onlypathway to uniform rules would require federal leg-islation. As a result, there have been two nationalbills drafted and put in front of Congress, with theintent to create a level playing eld and protect thewelfare of equine athletes. If approved, these fed-eral bills would strive to provide uniform anti-dop-ing and medication control programs by establishing AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 377IN-DEPTH: MEDICATION AND THERAPEUTICS FOR RACEHORSESstandards for the use of therapeutic medications and oversight through a single national authority.

We must take care to maintain a high level of awareness of why we exist as an organization, lest we lose our bearings in the midst of therapid pace at which things are changing and increasing in complexity.

Introduction Medication use in the equine industry is under con- siderable scrutiny by the general public, and in ef-fect, is threatening the veterinary community'ssocial operating license. The social license to oper-ate has been dened as existing when an industryhas the ongoing approval within the local commu-nity and other stakeholders, ongoing approval orbroad social acceptance and, most importantly, on-going acceptance. It is consequently granted by thecommunity, hence, the social license to operate hasto be earned and must be maintained. Where is theequine industry now and where does it need to be inthe next 5 years relative to medication in the per- formance h orse? Many believe that less is best. However, the question rem ains: while ensuring the survivability of the industry in which the horsecompetes, what is best for the horse? Stakeholders,including veterinarians, are recognizing that medi-cation use in performance horses is no longerdeemed universally acceptable, despite scientic ev-idence of benet. Numerous industry attempts toeducate the public on the difference between thera-peutic medication versus performance enhancingmedication have fallen in vain as permissive use ofmedication in equine sport is becoming less and lesstolerated by society. The need to educate the public AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 379IN-DEPTH: MEDICATION AND THERAPEUTICS FOR RACEHORSES NOTESthat therapeutic medication is necessary to main- tain a healthy athlete is laudable yet it is becomingmore difcult to obtain validation from a non-agrarian-based society. This is not a new frontier.However, in the public lens, responsible medicationuse in equine sport is becoming increasingly impor-tant and the equine veterinary community mustadapt to a changing world if racing and performancehorse sports are to remain viable and relevant. Rest assured that the sky is not falling when it pertains to use of medication in performance horses.That said, equine veterinarians are a trusted re-source, must remain so, and must be tolerant andaccepting to public interest and concerns pertainingto medication in the competitive equine athlete.The focus of this presentation will be directed pri-marily to the racing industry and its stakeholders,whose utmost priority needs to be the safety andwelfare of the horse. However, many of the sameprinciples and concepts presented here can be ap-plied to the majority of disciplines in the perfor-mance horse industry as well. 2. Discussion Medication issues in equine sport have been at theforefront of veterinary medicine for many years.In fact, medication issues in racing have been aprovocative issue since the inception of the Am eri- can Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP).A headline in the Los Angeles Times read, \"Cops Ride with Vets\" depicting the poor image of theracetrack practitioner, thus serving as the primaryimpetus of the founding members of the AAEP b. For the past 60 years, medication use in racing hasbeen a recurrent topic of conversation and debatewith the results sometimes coming full circle. Forexample, in 1965, the medication rule, which pro-hibited the use of specic medications 48 hours priorto a race, was abolished in California. Interest-ingly enough, in 2019 due to political pressure fromanimal rights activists, in conjunction with a mediacrisis surrounding fatalities at Santa Anita, a 48-hour medication rule was reinstated in California. Throughout the years, and in large part due to the service of many equine practitioners, model rulesand standards of practice were developed for com-petitive equine sports, specically horse racing.The 1960 AAEP Guidelines contained the PoliciesPertaining to Medication of Race Horses, essentiallybecoming the rules of racing at that time pertainingto medication. In 1963, the premise of medicationuniformity and responsible use of medication hadalready been born. According to Dr. Jack Robbins,\"If rules pertaining to medication could be moreclearly dened and standardized, the practice of eth-ical veterinary medicine would be greatly simpliedand facilitated\" c. Today, racing industry struggles with the same issues as uniformity of 38 racingjurisdictions adopting different sections of the Na-tional Uniform Medication Program (NUMP) hasbeen challenging. NUMP, developed through thework of the Racing Medication and Testing Consor-tium, is designed to provide unprecedented reformfor horse racing in the areas of uniform medicationrules, penalties, and testing guidelines. Muchprogress has been made, but because of differing issues among states, more work needs to be done toachieve medication uniformity in racing. The horse show industry has not been exempt from the perception of illicit drug use in medication.As such, the rst American Horse Show Association(AHSA) Drug and Medication Rules committee wasformed in 1971 to address illicit drug use with med-ication. Over the years, governing bodies such asFe\u00b4de\u00b4ration Equestre Internationale (FEI) and United State Equestrian Federation (USEF) havediligently attempted to provide medication guide-lines that are responsible and in the best interest ofthe horse. They have for the most part been suc-cessful in establishing regulations in performance,while protecting the horse, and ensuring the integ-rity of fair competition. However, due to the short-coming of inappropriate human competitiveness andthe desire to prevail and gain monetarily, these or-ganizations must remain steadfast in their regula-tory efforts to maintain stakeholder condence. In racing, the Racing Medication and Testing Consortium, established by the AAEP in 2001, hasbeen the most impactful and relevant organizationrelative to rules and regulations in the last severalyears. They have developed science-based industrystandards pertaining to medication withdrawaltimes and laboratory standards. They serve as aresource to industry stakeholders, specically veter-inarians and horsemen, when applying rules of rac-ing in a practical manner. The organizationcontinues to be the most germane and progressiveorganization in racing as far as rules, regulation,and policy are concerned. Rules and regulation insport are mandatory, and with the current sophisti-cated level of testing, they must remain practicaland fluid. The management of the aforementionedaspects of fair competition in racing is dependentupon veterinary practitioners and organizationssuch as the AAEP. Groups such as Racing Medication and Testing Consortium, which are veterinary centric, provideresources from veterinarians whereby the horse isthe central focus. Veterinarians are regarded asthe most trustworthy stewards regarding equinesafety according to a 2019 survey d. Racetrack and performance horse veterinarians must engage pro-fessionally and politically to defend the horse. Butequally important, is the need to continually man-age the veterinary profession in performance horses,thus providing a means for social license to operateas a professional entity within the realm of compet-itive equine sports. The social license to operate isconstantly evolving and based on public trust. Ifthat trust is lost, veterinarians could potentially losethe ability to maintain leadership in the equineindustry. 380 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: MEDICATION AND THERAPEUTICS FOR RACEHORSESSocial license to operate is a subjective concept, often used in the corporate world, and is essentially based on an industry's stakeholders, what theythink of equine veterinarians, in addition to publicperception of what veterinarians do. It is criticallyimperative to maintain a signicantly impactful so-cial operating license in the racing industry if vet-erinarians are to be at the stakeholder table to affectchange. Veterinarians need to be involved in med-ication issues relative to the performance/racingindustry. However, it is paramount to demon-strate a meaningful presence based on actions,thereby strengthening a position as advocates ofthe horse. In doing so, a social operating licensebecomes validated and signicant within theindustry. This is accomplished by establishing a profes- sional, ethical, and moral level of commitment to the welfare of the horse and the integrity of an entireindustry. The legitimacy of equine practitioners inthe racing or performance industry facilitates theircredibility given by stakeholders and eventuallyevolves into public trust. Public trust is necessaryfor the racing industry and the performance indus-try to survive. In order to provide that trust andmaintain a social license to operate as veterinarypractitioners, practitioners must remain ethical andresponsible in the use of medication, and at all costs,put the welfare of the horse rst; above nancialgain, recognition, and infamy. Additionally, continual assessment of a social op- erating license as a veterinary profession must occurto ensure relevance to the horse and the industrythat is served. It is a dynamic process, and as such,continual evaluation and measurement is needed toallow for change, acceptance, approval, and providemetrics of co-ownership of the veterinary social li-cense to operate in the racing and performanceindustry. So begs the question, how does the veterinary profession obtain and maintain social license to op-erate? Over the years, veterinarians have been re- garded as a trusted resource. How do practitionersmaintain that and continually develop that trust andacceptance from the public and stakeholders? The solution is relatively simple; however, it requires change and continual evolvement in aworld that is (was) constant and familiar. Racing,whether one recognizes it or not, will need a para-digm transformation in order to survive. Equinecompetition in general needs a cultural change if itis going to continue to exist and thrive. Mostwithin the industry are reluctant to accept this.However, how is horse racing destined to exist,much less survive, in a world where horses die?Horse racing, a multi-billion-dollar industry, cannotsurvive in its current format. Change needs to occur, and in an industry whereby change is hard, it needs to occur post hasteto prevent a perilous outcome. Leadership, spurredby the veterinary community, must lead this chargebased on science and fact, devoid of emotion wherepossible. 3. Conclusion The equine veterinary profession can affect change,in essence a cultural change, in equine sport andestablish responsible use of medication in racing/performance horse disciplines. As such, as a pro-fession and an organization of equine practitioners,racetrack and performance horse veterinarians havea proven track record since 1954 of doing so. Inorder to facilitate the industry to survive and thrive,several important areas of interest need to be ad-dressed and managed professionally by the veteri-nary community. They include, but are not limitedto the following: 1. Ethics\u2014As a profession, adherence to the pro- fessional conducts of ethical principles estab-lished by the American Veterinary MedicalAssociation (AVMA) and the AAEP eis critical. 2. Integrity\u2014Represent the profession and the industry with honesty and character. 3. Transparency\u2014Maintaining and providing complete medical records detailing responsi-ble treatment is in the best interest of thehorse. 4. Accountability\u2014Veterinarians must be ac- countable for their actions and must defendthe reasoning for their actions. 5. Uniformity\u2014Operating in a united manner is necessary for the sustainability of the industry. 6. Compassion\u2014Review the veterinarian's oath that was sworn upon graduation and neverlose focus on why veterinarians chose thisprofession in the rst place. 7. Morals\u2014This denes, in conjunction with eth- ical principles, the basis of the equine practi-tioner's social license to operate within theindustry. 8. Trust\u2014Validate by actions the role of the vet- erinarian as the steward for the horse. As a profession, equine practitioners must prescribe,administer, and treat based upon an accurate diag-nosis, with a valid veterinarian-client-patient rela-tionship (VCPR) in order to do what is best for thehorse. As veterinarians, it is imperative that ac-tions and treatments are based on what is best forthe horse. The sustainability of the industry is se-cured in that the welfare and safety of the horse isthe guiding principle, and the profession must neverabandon that principle. History has revealed thatresponsible medication use in competition by veter-inarians, whether it be in performance horse disci-plines or racing, has been a contentious andadvancing issue in the public lens. With the issues that occurred in racing in Califor- nia in 2019, the industry stakeholders, including theveterinary community, are recognizing the need for AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 381IN-DEPTH: MEDICATION AND THERAPEUTICS FOR RACEHORSESurgent change to secure the sustainability of the racing industry in particular. Change is often hard, but with change comes growth. Racing, the performance horse industry,and the equine veterinarian are in the midst of thegreatest change, and perhaps the most profoundgrowth that will ever be experienced in the equineindustry. It will require the commitment and ded-ication of all industry stakeholders in order to besuccessful. At the end of the day, the beneciary ofthis change and growth will be the horse. And isn'tthat what it's all about! Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of Veter- inary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

The veterinarian is integrally involved in all aspects of these equine safety protocols as the attending veterinarian, race-dayofcial, or regulatory veterinarian and association veterinarian. Author's address: \u00a9 2020 AAEP. 1. Introduction Racing and training injuries have always been a concern and the focus of countless initiatives to im-prove safety of the participants. Much progresshas been made in reducing injury rates; however,clusters or specic high-prole incidents continue tokeep the issue of safety in the public conversation.Recently, the preponderance of social media andreal-time fatality chronicling is challenging the in-dustry to eliminate fatalities or face racings' extinc-tion. In North America, equine safety protocolsfocused on reducing fatal fractures have been devel-oped and implemented over the last 30 years, pri-marily from the epidemiological contributions ofthe California Postmortem Examination Program(1990) and the Equine Injury Database (EID) (2008). Evolution of Thoroughbred Racing Safety Protocols In 1990, the increasing incidence of Thoroughbredracing injuries resulted in the California legislatureestablishing the California Postmortem Examina-tion Program. The program mandates the nec-ropsy of all equine fatalities at state-licensed racingand training facilities. Early ndings identiedpre-existing bone conditions in horses with fatal fractures, leading to the implementation of nuclearscintigraphy imaging at Santa Anita racetrack. 1 An epidemiological cohort study, conducted in Ken-tucky and reported in 1996, validated the ofcialveterinarians' role in identifying horses at higherrisk of injury (\"at risk horse\") based on prerace phys-ical inspection ndings. 2-4In 2008, the EID was established out of a proposal rst put forth at the2006 Welfare and Safety of the Racehorse Summit.Funded entirely by The Jockey Club and designedand developed through its commercial subsidiaries,along with leading regulatory veterinarians in theUnited States, the national database records inju-ries during racing and training, capturing 96% ofannual race starts in North America. Data fromthe EID are instrumental for developing mitigationstrategies for injury prevention. 5For example, fac- tors for horses at risk of fatal fracture are used byofcial veterinarians to identify \"horses of interest\"requiring extra scrutiny to soundnessprior THERAPEUTICS FOR RACEHORSES NOTESIn 2012, the governor established The New York Task Force on Racehorse Health and Safety6in re- sponse to a cluster of 21 racing and training fatali- ties at the Aqueduct racetrack. The task forceconcluded New York should modify several existingcritical protocols, including identication of pre-ex-isting conditions, stand down period for intra-artic-ular (IA) injections, restriction on other pre-racemedications, criteria for attending veterinarian in-tervention, and the need for treatment records on allhorses. In early 2019, The Stronach Group (TSG), owner and operator of Santa Anita racetrack in California,introduced several \"house rules\" as part of the En-hanced Safety Procedures in response to a clusterof racing- and training-related fatalities. 7These rules included mandatory examination by the at-tending veterinarian and intensied ofcial veteri-narian scrutiny of horses of interest prior to timedwork outs and race entry. This represents the rsttime any organization has mandated that the at-tending veterinarian participate in assessing thehorses' suitability to safely complete high-speed ex-ercise (timed work out or race). The California Horse Racing Board issued a re- port on 23 fatalities that occurred during the rst 3months of the Santa Anita race meet in 2019. 8 This report examined each of the fatalities and pub-lished key ndings and recommendations in variousareas, including track maintenance, management ofthe racing ofce, training practices, private veteri-nary practitioners and practices, horse safety andwelfare, and regulatory veterinary procedures andpractices. A number of factors combined as caus-ative agents; however, 21 of the 22 fatal fracturecases exhibited signs of pre-existing pathology \"pre-sumed to be associated with high exercise intensity,which predisposed these horses to catastrophic in-jury.\" Furthermore, 19 of the 22 fatal fracture casesinvolved the proximal sesamoid bones of the meta-carpophalangeal (fetlock) joint. 8 2. Veterinary Safety Protocols\u2014Identify Horses of Interest I. Pre-Existing Pathology\u2014Greater than 85% of fatal musculoskeletal injuries have pre-existing pathology at the site of fatal fracture,9and it is estimated that 40 to 60% of fatal fractures worldwide involve the fetlock. 10,11Multiple factors affect the accumulation of bone stress injury(BSI) or bone damage that result in frac-ture. These factors include the repetitive cy-cling nature of training (galloping), the speed ofthe horse during training and racing, and the distances that racehorses train and race. Re-petitive high-magnitude loads incurred duringtraining and racing exceed concurrent damageremoval and replacement, resulting in transientperiods of focal osteoporosis and bone weaken-ing. 12Strategies to identify horses with clini-cal signs or history of BSI, especially involving the fetlock joint include the following: a. Lameness\u2014lameness associated with high- speed exercise (timed work out or race) may beindicative of BSI. The protocols inserting theattending veterinarian for mandatory pre-work/racehorse evaluation provides an oppor-tunity for recognition and intervention inthe BSI process. Fracture can be preventedby early diagnosis and adequate bone injurymanagement. 12-15The attending veterinar- ian (racetrack practitioner) is perfectly posi-tioned as the primary diagnostician oflameness in these pre-exercise evaluations. b. Previous injury\u2014horses with medical history of lameness within the preceding 3 months areat a higher risk of fatal fracture. 16Fractures occur during high-risk periods caused bythe events in the previous 2-3 months, al-though sometimes 6 months to years, preced-ing the acute fracture. 4,11The attending veterinarian, as the primary care veterinar-ian, possesses the critical patient history andknowledge of prior medical procedures to bestdiagnose lameness and establish a criticalpathway for resolution. c. IA Injections\u2014there was medical history of IA therapy in 11 of the 22 fatal fractures at SantaAnita 8and \"...intra-articular corticosteroids may have impaired veterinarians and trainersfrom accurately assessing the horses' sound-ness leading up to a race\" was a nding of theNew York Task Force. 7 II. Risk Modeling for Fatal Fracture\u2014The EID annually publicizes statistical summaries ofracing injuries and signicant ndings of on-going epidemiological studies. To date, over20 factors for horses of increased risk of fatalinjury or fracture have been identied. 17Ex- amples of horse-level risk factors utilized toidentify horses of interest include the follow-ing: a. 4-year-old or older non-starterb. 120-day lay-off c. Vet List appearance for \"unsoundness\" d. Previous EID injury e. Recent trainer change 3. Overview of the Veterinarian in Thoroughbred Racing Safety Protocols Ofcial Veterinarian Equine Medical Director (State Regulatory Authority) The equine medical director (EMD) is employed by the state, commonly with a university position orafliation, serving as the chief veterinary stewardfor the racing authority (commonly known as \"com-mission,\" \"board,\" or The EMD AND THERAPEUTICS FOR RACEHORSESsees the equine drug testing program and provides veterinary oversight, scientic and clinical exper-tise, strategic planning, and recommendations tothe regulatory authority. The EMD acts in a su-pervisory role to regulatory veterinarians perform-ing drug testing, examinations to determine tnessfor racing and training, and emergency care for rac-ing horses. Regulatory Veterinarian (State Regulatory Authority) The regulatory veterinarian is employed by the State Regulatory Authority with duties to enforcethe rules of racing. Regulatory veterinarians maynot engage in the veterinary care of racehorses,horses in training, or any horses owned by individ-uals licensed by the regulatory authority beyond thescope of their duties. Specic duties include thefollowing: direct and supervise the collection of pre-and post-race samples for the testing of horses forprohibited substances, inspect and record ndingsconcerning racing soundness for horses entered, andmaintain the ofcial veterinarian's list (\"Vet List\") ofhorses that are ineligible to race because of sicknessor unsoundness. Association Veterinarian (Racing Association) The association veterinarian is licensed by the State Regulatory Authority (as racing ofcial) and is em-ployed by the racetrack or entity that owns the race-track. The association veterinarian enforces therules of racing (State Regulations) where appropri-ate (as designee, and house rules as set forth bythe racetrack. They are also known as the EMD,equine safety director, chief veterinary ofcer, ortrack veterinarian. Attending Veterinarian (Racetrack Practitioner) The attending veterinarian is licensed by the State Regulatory Authority (as practicing veterinarian)and is employed by the horse owner or trainer.All attending veterinarians administering drugs,medications, or other substances are responsible forensuring that the drugs, medications, or other sub-stances and the veterinary treatment of horses areadministered in accordance with regulations, rules,and conditions for racing and training. 4. Safety Protocol Implementation\u2014State Regulations, Rules, and Conditions for Racing and Training I. State Rules and Regulations (Regulation)\u2014 Each state has an independent agency of state government charged with the responsibility ofregulating the conduct of horse racing andpari-mutuel wagering on horse racing and re-lated activities within the state. The agency(also known as commission, board, or author-ity)enforces statues (laws) and the regula- tions under these statutes. The agencycreates, modies, and amends regulationsthrough the legislative process and employsstaff to perform and/or oversee regula-tions. For example, most all states employveterinarians to perform and oversee drugtesting procedures. The legislative process ofcreating or amending regulations requiresjustication, the identication of fundingsources, set timelines for debate, and publiccomment before becoming law. Therefore,the timeline for implementation of regulationscan vary from months to years from state tostate. II. Rules and Conditions for Racing and Training (House Rule)\u2014The racetrack association isthe business entity holding a license from theState Regulatory Authority to conduct racingand/or pari-mutuel wagering. The associa-tion has inherent articles, policies, and proce-dures to conduct racing and pari-mutuelwagering. As a prerequisite for participation(compete in a sanctioned pari-mutuel race) orto have access to association stabling andtraining facilities, trainers agree to and enterby contract to abide by association rules andconditions for racing and training (commonlytermed house rules). These contracts tradi-tionally are included in the \"entry document\"(horse nominated or subscribed to participatein a pari-mutuel race) or the \"stall application\"that the trainer completes for the allocation ofstabling at association facilities. By right of\"exclusion,\" the act of preventing a personfrom participating, entering, or remaining onassociation grounds, the association enforcesthese rules and conditions. House rules canbe implemented immediately at the discretionof the racetrack. The Enhanced Safety Pro-cedures enacted at California racetracks inMarch 2019 in response to the cluster of fatal-ities at Santa Anita were implemented imme-diately by a combination of house rules andemergency regulation. 7 5. Race-Entered Safety Protocols Risk Assessment: Identify Horses of Interest I. InCompass Solutions \"Pre-Race Veterinary Exam\" Software\u2014InCompass Solutions, a commercial subsidiary of The Jockey Club,provides a central database that serves as aplatform for several industry initiatives,including the EID and the Race Track Opera-tions system. The Pre-Race VeterinaryExam module is designed for use by ofcialveterinarians for the purposes of performingand maintaining a database associated withthe pre-race and limb examinations performeddaily at racetracks. The aim is to provide ahistory on each horse to enable ofcial veteri-narians to determine if an ailment is new andshould be watched carefully or is an old injurythat has had no ill effect on the racehorse in AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 385IN-DEPTH: MEDICATION AND THERAPEUTICS FOR RACEHORSESthe past. Racing and work out history is also provided to assist in making race-day deci-sions on whether to allow a horse to race ornot. II. InCompass Solutions \"Targeted Algo- rithms\"\u2014These custom daily reports are pro-vided to ofcial veterinarians using criteria pertinent to individual racetracks or jurisdic-tions. Each entered horses' racing data, con-tained in the Race Track Operations systemdatabase, is screened for EID markers of in-creased risk of injury, identifying horses ofinterest. Horse-level risk factors include pre-vious EID injuries, appearance on the VetList, and duration of time with same trainer. 18 III. Mandatory Published Work Outs\u2014Horses in EID categories of increased risk of injury, as acondition of race entry, require mandatorytimed work outs with added requirements(i.e., ofcial veterinarian pre-work examina-tion, minimum distance and time, post-worktesting, and others). These mandatory workouts are stipulated by regulation or houserules. IV. Training Patterns and Published Work Outs\u2014Individual horse racing and training(published work outs) history is reviewed forfrequency, distances worked, and irregulari-ties in work patterns indicating a potentialissue requiring additional scrutiny. Medical History: Identify Horses of Interest I. Daily Treatment Records\u2014In most jurisdic- tions, by regulation, Daily Treatment Recordsare condential records of treatments and pro-cedures performed by the attending veterinar-ian and are provided daily to the regulatoryauthority. Attending veterinarian medicalrecords for individual entrants are reviewedfor treatments, examinations, or diagnosticsperformed corresponding to training, and/orrace pattern irregularities. II. Lameness Examinations and Diagnostics\u2014 These procedures are documented in therequired Daily Treatment Records. Thetrainer and/or attending veterinarian are re-quired to produce individual medical records(e.g., dates, procedures, and results) for en-trants when requested. III. Intra-Articular Injections and Electric Shock Wave Therapy Treatments\u2014By regulation,these procedures are reported with a manda-tory stand down from racing, enforced byplacement on the ofcial Vet List. Veterinary Examinations: Identify Horses of Interest I. Attending Veterinarian Examination Within 3 Days of Entry\u2014All potential entrants mustbe examined by the attending veterinarian forthe express purpose of evaluating the horse'stness to race as a condition of entry. Theevaluation must include, at a minimum, watching the horse jog. The attending veter-inarian records of the examination are docu-mented on the Daily Treatment Records, orindividual medical records are made availablefor review when requested. II. Ofcial Veterinarian Examination\u2014Select horses of interest are subject to examinationby the ofcial veterinarian prior to raceday. Examination ndings are recorded inthe InCompass Pre-Race Veterinary Exammodule, enhancing the pertinent medical in-formation available for future reference. 6. Training Population Safety Protocols I. Observed/Monitored Training\u2014Ofcial veter- inarian observation and monitoring of horseswhile training on association-provided sur-faces has been a component of the Breeders'Cup Veterinary Inspection Panel and otherselected events since 1993. 19In early 2019, \"Morning Training Oversight\" by ofcial vet-erinarians was instituted in response to ahigher death rate experienced at Lone StarRacetrack in Texas 20and as one of the Enhanced Safety Procedures at SantaAnita. Ofcial veterinarians are presenttrackside during training hours to observe thepopulation perform routine exercise ses-sions. Horses exhibiting unsoundness with the attending veterinar-ian regarding criteria for flagged horses to continue or return to training. In somecases, horses may be placed on the Vet Listand subject to specic requirements forremoval. II. Mandatory Work Outs/Ofcial Veterinarian Examinations\u2014Horses with specic risk pa-rameters for horses of interest are required towork out, with varied requirements depen-dent upon the risk parameter. For example,in California, unraced 4-year-olds are placedon the Vet List and must complete a Vet List-level work out (examination pre-work andpost-work by ofcial veterinarian, minimum 5furlongs in sub 1:03 and post-work drug test-ing), in addition to other requirements for arst time starter. III. Attending Veterinarian Examination within 5 Days of Work Out\u2014Included in the CaliforniaEnhanced Safety Procedures is a demonstra-tion of the horses' tness to work prior tospeed exercise (published work out). The at-tending veterinarian performs and recordsthe examination (the evaluation shall include,at a minimum, watching the horse jog) on theDaily Treatment Records or makes other med-ical records available for review whenrequested. 386 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: RACEHORSESIV. Forty-Eight-Hour Work Out Notice\u2014Notica- tion of intent to work is a requirement of the California Enhanced Safety Procedureswork monitoring program. Internal re-views of past performance data and all avail-able information from the horses slated towork are used to identify individuals worthyof further scrutiny (horses of interest). Theofcial veterinarian then works with all par-ties to determine if the horse is approved towork or whether another course of action isrequired. V. Out of Competition Testing\u2014The state regulatory body propagates regulations re-stricting or prohibiting the use and admin-istration of drugs or stimulants or otherimproper acts to horses prior to the horseparticipating in a race. Any horse eligibleto race is subject to testing without advancenotice for specied substances. A horseshall be presumed eligible to race if (a) it isunder the care, custody, or control of a li-censed trainer; (b) it is owned by a licensedowner; (c) it is nominated to a race at alicensed association; (d) it has raced at alicensed association within the previous 12calendar months; (e) it is stabled on thegrounds of a licensed association or a train-ing facility; or (f) it is nominated to partici-pate in a specied race (i.e., Breeders'Cup). The denition encompasses the en-tire racing population regardless of currentlocation. 7. Conclusion More than 83% of racing and training fatalities areattributable to musculoskeletal injury. 21An early nding of the California Post-Mortem ExaminationProgram, which has been veried annually in the 30years since the programs' inception, is evidence ofpre-existing pathology in more than 85% of the fatalmusculoskeletal injuries. The nding of prior pa-thology at the fracture site means most fatal injuriesare preventable. To date, the Thoroughbred industry approach has been to identify horses at a higher risk of injuryprior to racing. In fact, this risk modeling devel-oped through the EID has yielded a 20% reduction inthe national fatal injury rate since the databases'inception in 2008. Horses of interest are scruti-nized on race day to determine suitability to start,which is ultimately the decision of the ofcial veter-inarian. Practically, the question is \"if this horsestarts, will it end in fatal injury?\" If the answer is\"no\" for every starter entered, then all horses wouldcompete in the race. In these cases, the ofcialveterinarian is correct 99.47% of the time (2019 EIDnational fatal injury rate was 1.53 per 1,000starters). The cluster of fatalities at the Santa Anita race- track in early 2019 led to the implementation ofhouse rules and Enhanced Safety Procedures. Par-ticular procedures applied risk modeling by ofcialveterinarians to the training population and man-dated that attending veterinarians evaluate horsesprior to high-speed exercise events (timed work outsand races). The Enhanced Safety Proceduresyielded a 30% reduction in racing fatal injuries anda remarkable 50% reduction in training fatalinjuries. a Veterinarians implementing stringent safety pro- tocols to the entire at-risk training and racingpopulation have the greatest potential to decreasefatalities and improve the safety of racings'participants.

KY 40383 (Redden); University of Florida, College of Veterinary Medicine, and therapeutic shoeing are terms often used interchangeably to describe specialshoeing required to address a variety of lower-limband foot issues to career- and life-threatening inju-ries and disease. Pathological shoeing is a veryserious process that demands the greatest respect ofveterinarians and farriers. Obtaining success de-pends on adequate preparation, knowledge of thesubject, strong principles, and skills of two highlyrespected professional elds of public service. Rec-ognizing the gravity of the specic issues and beingwell prepared to think through the medical and me-chanical requirements is paramount for success.These two highly respected professionals must shareequal responsibility for the health of the foot, yetthey do not have a common thread of education,knowledge, or skills required for collaborativeefforts. 1 There is a steep learning curve for the veterinar- ian/farrier team to shift from their routine dailytask to using radiographs as a guide for mechanicalsolutions. The veterinarian must obtain workingknowledge of the foot and a basic understanding of farrier principles and the farrier must become famil-iar with radiographic parameters and how theyrelate to the external landmarks of the foot. Asfarriers learn to read and interpret the radiographicinformation that relates specically to the task andveterinarians develop working knowledge of howmechanics can offer medical benets, the learningcurve begins to flatten out. Additionally, high-levelpathological shoeing requires considerably differentfarrier supplies and equipment than most farrierswould normally have and a much larger time com-mitment from both professionals. Without a thor-ough understanding of the task at hand by either orboth professionals, success is left to chance. This isthe weakest link in pathological shoeing. Whenboth the veterinarian and farrier understand thevalue of the mechanical thought process, the infor-mation offers predictability and improved success rates. The strategy for pathological shoeingbased on radiographic information offers unlim-ited mechanical options that would notbe available. AAEP PROCEEDINGS 66 /H114082020 389HOW LAMENESS for this how-to session is the chal- lenge that faces veterinarians and farriers that are not accustomed to using radiographs to plan themechanical strategy. The objective is to describethe basic methodology and consequences of usingradiographic data as blueprints when pathologicalshoeing is required as a treatment for foot issues. 2. Visual Assessment and How It Relates to the Mechanical Thought Process The exam should rst start with evaluating the ex- ternal characteristics of the foot and should be per-formed in a systematic fashion. The external hoofcapsule and the sole should be cleaned of all debristo allow accurate evaluation. The evaluator shouldfocus on the dorsal face of the hoof capsule, coronaryband, ground surface, heel and heel bulbs, and pas-tern plane and digital alignment relative to planesof the foot. During the exam, it is important torealize that there is a range of normal for hoof char-acteristics that is dependent on the horse's age,breed, environment, use, and previous injury or dis-ease. It is helpful to know what may be considered\"normal\" for that particular foot in order to identifysubtle deviations from \"normal\" that are of clinicalsignicance. The hoof prole and growth ring pat-tern can change every few millimeters and eachalteration is there for a reason. Growth ring pat-terns, from toe-to-heel and medial-to-lateral andsole growth describe the response to the nutrientsupply to the tubular and solar papillae. The horngrowth centers are in turn influenced by the me-chanical forces within the foot, thus giving meaningto the word, \"mechanics\". The mechanical thought process is not well under- stood; therefore, success with pathological shoeingin the past was routinely thwarted by the lack of ameans to develop a sound mechanical plan. Untilmore recently, shoeing recommendations were with-out a specic plan and as a rule were focused ontrimming the capsule in a fashion to make it appearas if the ill effects of the issue suddenly were elim-inated. Trimming and shoeing without regard tothe mechanical imbalance of forces that oppose in-jured or diseased components can be counterproduc-tive and result in escalation of further imbalancethat can become a devastating vicious cycle. Morerecently, the perception of the foot as a mechanicalmodel with suspension and complementary supportcomponents has made it possible to better under-stand the cause and effect of the internal forces onthe healthy foot, as well as those with a variety ofpathological issues (Fig. 1). Through this model,the distal phalanx is suspended within the hoof cap-sule by and flexor tendon (DDFT), theDDFT provides suspension to the caudal as-pect of the distal phalanx. The author has theo-rized that the DDFT exerts considerable influenceon the digital structure and function and is thus akey factor in many of the causes of pathologicaldistortion of the hoof capsule. 2This theory was de- rived from the author's years of clinical experienceand is supported by gross exam, radiographic andvenographic assessment, as well as monitoringclinical outcome. This work suggests that there isa consistent and direct correlation between theamount of tension in the DDFT and patency of dor-sal lamellar and the circumflex vessels in bothhealthy feet and those with pathological issues.It was also concluded that mechanical manipulationcould remarkably reduce DDFT tension and aidreperfusion to compromised components and horngrowth centers, ultimately producing medical bene-ts. Scientic in vivo biomechanical research could further knowledge concerning the tendon theory.The mechanical approach has provided an array ofefcient trimming and shoeing options that are de-signed to offset or attenuate the offending force ofthe DDFT as it opposes and/or influences the failingantagonist or adjacent components. 3. The Value of Podiatry-Focused Radiographs When used in combination with the external char-acteristics of the foot, radiographs further enhanceand ne tune the clinician's ability to identify andmonitor changes in the feet. Traditional foot radio-graphs are taken with the primary beam centeredjust below the coronary band with the purpose ofidentifying pathology in either the cofn joint ornavicular apparatus. They fail, however, to pro-vide information for the veterinarian-farrier team tocondently or correctly assess the relationship of theexternal landmarks (hoof capsule) relative to theinternal (DP) radiographic Fig. 1. This mechanical diagram is a very basic representation of the suspension and support components of the foot. When thefoot is balanced, these components work in harmony and have theability to have full recall. 390 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO MANAGE HOOF LAMENESS means to measure the soft-tissue pa- rameters relative to the task to be undertaken are arequired precursor to the mechanical planning stageof pathological shoeing. 3,4Crucial details regard- ing the trim, shoe fabrication, and placement arebased on pertinent radiographic information. Thetechniques for taking podiatry-focused radiographshave been previously described by the author andare represented in Fig. 2. 3-5Podiatry-focused foot radiographs are typically taken with the shoes on asit is important to understand how the previous shoe-ing influenced the horn growth rate and pattern andhow the current trim and shoe relates to the soft-tissue parameters and digital alignment. Under-standing the sole depth prior to pulling shoes canhelp prevent unwarranted pain and further damageto feet with shallow and or convex soles and mayhelp anticipate the need for the application of pro-tective boots prior to putting the foot down. Theviews should be taken with both the front and hindfeet on blocks of adequate and equal height, so thatthe cross hairs of the generator are at height ofapproximately 12to34inch (12-18 mm) higher than the height of the positioning blocks. This assuresthat the primary beam is aligned between the pal-mar rim and the ground surface of the barefoot orshoe, which should produce a radiograph with thebranches of the shoe superimposed over each other.There are certain situations, which represent excep-tions to this rule, where the shoe thickness, pads, orexcessive sole depth raises the palmar rim height(sole depth) approximately 25 mm above the pri-mary beam and requires the primary beam to beraised. In this scenario, the branches of the shoewill not be superimposed and so a second low-beamLM will need to be taken so the branches of the shoeare superimposed in order to accurately interpretground palmar angle (palmar angle [PA]; see below)(Fig. 3) and digital breakover. Foot radiographstaken in this fashion offer a more accurate and con-sistent representation of the areas of interest thanthe traditionally recommended \"high-beam\"-orien-tated foot radiographs focused navicular apparatus. espe-cially foot radiographs, should be taken with a spe-cic goal in mind, and sometimes that maynecessitate taking both high- and low-beam LMand DP images, each with their own purpose inmind. There are several points that need to be addressed in order to enhance the quality of images to avoidmisinterpretation of radiographic assessment sec-ondary to radiographic artifacts such as distortionand magnication. First and foremost, the usershould always seek to obtain radiographs on a flat,level surface with the horse standing as squarely aspossible and the blocks positioned relative to anytoe-in or toe-out conformation to assure the bestrepresentation of natural, static conformation, digi-tal alignment, and joint surfaces. These tips addi-tionally assure that the radiographic beam isoriented perpendicular to the cassette to minimizedistortion. Magnication can be minimized by en-suring a consistent zero subject-lm distance (platetouching the subject) and a consistent focal-lm dis-tance (24 to 28 inches). Magnication increases asthe distance from the cassette to the subject in-creases or when the distance from the focal spot tothe object decreases. Magnication cannot beavoided on the DP image due to interference withthe fetlock unless a palmar-dorsal image is taken.Fortunately, measurements are not always requiredon the DP image, so these are usually taken out ofconvenience unless a specic reason arises. Themajority of digital x-ray units do not have a calibra-tion aid to compensate for the magnication of theparameters along the sagittal plane as the softwareis designed to measure distance at the level of thedetector and are therefore not reliable. A knownlength of metal placed on the sagittal plane andanother of identical length on the detector conrmsthe need for the calibration device. Radiographicmarkers should be applied to the dorsal hoof wall aseven with advances of digital radiography, there isalways some evidence of burnout (saturation arti-fact) of the dorsal lamellar wall. The author pre-fers to use a line of barium paste as it highlights thecontour of the dorsal hoof wall more accurately thandoes a piece of wire or other metallic object. Itshould be applied along the dorsal hoof wall startingat the horn-coronary band junction; it can also beused to accurately measure the relationship be-tween the coronary crest and the extensor process.Lastly, interpretation of radiographs should bemade with the knowledge of the most recent trim orshoeing. A trim alone can initially change many ofthe soft tissue parameters; however, these parame-ters can slowly start to drift back to their originalmeasurements within a matter of days.

Processing the Data Obtaining the desired images is the rst step towardplanning the mechanical goals and options. Whenradiographs are obtained in a consistent fashion, theuser can then precisely and repeatedly measure thesoft-tissue parameters, identify the mechanical lim-itations, and formulate a treatment plan. Soft-tissue parameters that are of interest to the farrierinclude sole depth, PA, bone angle, horn-laminaezone, and digital breakover (Fig. 3). Medial-to-lat-eral balance is also a parameter that can be esti-mated from the LM image but best evaluated on theDP image. The data is only as valuable as one'sability to process it in a manner that offers realisticguidelines relative to the mechanical decits as wellas viable reversal treatment options. When usedcorrectly and in conjunction with the external char-acteristics of the foot, these parameters can shedlight on the mechanical decit that often contributesto the seat of the problem (Fig. 4). Having a diag-nosis is great as long as the mechanical require-ments of restoring healthy horn and othersuspension and support components are under-stood as the presumably primary issue is treated. 2 Sole Depth Sole depth is the distance measured from the solarmargin at the apex of the third phalanx to the radi-olucent border of the sole. This is typically a pa-rameter that is routinely estimated by the farrier,but a relatively accurate interpretation of the soledepth can represent a challenge for even the mostexperienced farrier. It is quite easy to know if it isadequate, or in excess but knowing precisely the soledepth distal to the apex requires a proper lateralradiograph especially when it is extremely thin, 5 to6 mm. Based on venographic studies, a sole depthof less than 15 mm is considered clinically signi-cant. As the sole depth decreases, the solar papil-lae are usually bent, compressed, or absent,respectively. Inadequate solar papillae on veno-graphic studies can translate to inadequate bloodsupply and in the author's experience, leads to poorsole growth and ultimately creates a vicious cycle ofthin, tender soles. The lack of adequate foot massoccurs for reasons other than at the hands of farri-ers, therefore radiographic sole depth is an impor- Fig. 3.

B, The low-beam LM reveals one branch of the shoe, two branches of the cofn bone thatindicates medial listing in this case, and accurate sole depth. C, High-beam LM with the same foot as in panel B, revealing twodistinct branches of the shoe that is superimposed over the sole and the wings are deceptively superimposed. A low-beam DP imagewould verify the presence of medial listing. Fig. 4. A, Positive PA with sole depth equaling the HL zone plus equal amount of cup.

C, Negative PA, combination ofsole and cup is greater than the HL zone. Where are the most probable hot spots? Visualize the PA being dependent on the tensionof the DDFT as it regulates the pitch of these feet. The hoof apparently grows subsequent to the capabilities of the solar and tubularpapillae that are dependent on circulation. 392 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO MANAGE HOOF LAMENESS IItant consideration before trim and equally important after the trim when there is a specicmechanical plan. PA The PA refers to the angle between the solar marginof the distal phalanx and the ground surface. Theground surface can either be dened as the groundsurface of the hoof capsule or the ground itself andbecause of this there could be two separate PAs(capsule PA and ground PA, respectively) dependingon the level of mechanics of the shoe. To obtain anaccurate assessment, both branches of the shoeshould be superimposed on the LM projection.The PA alludes to the function of the DDFT and is avery important consideration when designing me-chanics. Increased suspension increases PA andequivalent heel growth. This is consistent withclub feet that have a relatively healthy foot butincreased DDFT tension relative to the increasedcontraction forces of the muscle belly (Fig. 5A).Chronic laminitis has an increasing PA as the DDFTchallenges its direct antagonist, and the failing lam-inae anchor no longer resists the relentless imbal-ance of forces. In both of these conditions, there istoo much suspension, leading to sole papillae thatare compressed and not capable of growing adequatesole. Clinically, a growth ring pattern that has aremarkably wider distance between the adjacentrings at the heel than at the toe is an indication of increased suspension via the action of the DDFT(Fig. 5B). On the other end of the spectrum, adeciency in the suspension components of thefoot is apparent when the adjacent ring spaces arewider at the toe than heel. When this occurs, theheel papillae are compressed and not capable ofgrowing adequate horn tubules. The dorsal tubu-lar papillae remain uninhibited by load and subse-quently grow excessive toe that is consistent withthe crushed heel, negative PA foot (Fig. 6, A and B).Radiographic evidence consistently reveals the con-sequences of sagging or excessive suspension andgives support to the tendon theory. The crushed heel, negative PA foot is one of the most common problems that farriers and veterinar-ians face and a study in mechanics. Farriers are often accused of removing too much heel creatingthe issue, radiographic evidence disconrms this ac-cusation. It has been thought in the past that thetension on the DDFT steadily increases as the heelis lowered. However, crushed heels and negativePA feet have various degrees of broken back digitalalignment and when the pastern becomes more up-right the distance from origin to insertion of theDDFT remarkably shortens. This results in fur-ther decreased tension and unrestricted blood flowto the productive solar papillae distal to the apex of Fig. 5. A, Soft-tissue parameters reveal useful information for the veterinary/farrier team. Note the PA is quite similar to the angle between the diverging growth rings in panel B. B, The external characteristic describes the heel-to-toe ratio growth rate and is ahelpful reference, especially toward the end of the reset schedule. Fig. 6. A, Note that the toe grew approximately twice as much as the heel over the past 2 months, increasing sole depth. B, Notethe similar negative angle, one branch of the shoe, and two wings of the cofn bone. Most often it will be the medial wing. A DPview is required to conrm. cofn bone. The lateral image consistently re- veals an adequate sole along with a natural cup.The lateral image also reveals some degree of cofnjoint luxation that supports inadequate tension ofthe DDFT as a possible contributing factor. These mechanical alterations are only discernible with podiatry focused radiographs. A helpful tip is that the frog trimmed to its natu- ral base also lies along a very similar plane as thepalmar rim of the third phalanx. The linear area ofthe deepest part of the sulci along the frog is quiteclose to the same plane as the palmar rim. Pastedening this area (sulci) on a lateral view can be ahelpful teaching aid as it can help guide the trimplane that oftentimes is strikingly different thanthat of a routine trim. An imaginary line that con-nects a dot of paste placed at the skin frog junctionand another at the apex of the frog also will be in avery similar plane as the palmar rim. Using theselandmarks helps the farrier develop an eye for amore precise trim when specic goals are indicated. Bone Angle The bone angle is the angle made by the dorsal andsolar surfaces of the cofn bone. Why is it impor-tant to measure bone angle? The answer is thatbone angles typically differ between right and leftand front and hind feet. Farriers are most oftenexpected to match toe angles as it is assumed thatall feet should match and be symmetrical. The oldsaying, \"assumptions and expectations are differentthan fact,\" is an understatement. Feet seldom ifever match and certainly are not symmetrical insideor out. The bone angle is approximately 50\u00b0 in themajority of feet however it can vary 10\u00b0 to 12\u00b0 less orgreater than 50\u00b0. Exceptionally low bone angles are often the cause for low toe angles in spite of adequate PA and solemass. The mismatched syndrome is prevalent inmost all breeds and it is common to nd mismatchedbone angles, especially in the front feet that vary asmuch as 10\u00b0 or 12\u00b0. When the bone angle is re- markably larger in one front foot than the other,trying to match toe angles with a rasp can be a futileattempt and go against the natural mechanical bal-ance of the foot. It is not uncommon to nd variousgrades of club feet with 5\u00b0 to 10\u00b0 greater bone anglethan the opposing foot. Therefore, the commonlytermed \"high/low\" horse can have matching PAs yethave toe angles that are 10\u00b0 different. Attempts tomatch them without this radiographic evidence canbe futile as well as detrimental. One should also beaware of the bone angle relative to the capsule PAwhen considering an inferior check ligament desmo-tomy as a high bone angle (60\u00b0) and a low PA (5\u00b0)will not offer favorable results due to the low PA(Fig. 7, A and C). As a rule, the majority of light-boned breeds have a bone angle of 50\u00b0 give or take a couple degrees,although, much lower bone angles are also relativelycommon (Fig. 7B). Horn-Lamellar Zone The horn-lamellar zone (HL) is dened as the dis-tance between the dorsal surface of third phalanxand the outer surface of the dorsal hoof wall, mea-sured perpendicular to the dorsal face of thirdphalanx. It is commonly measured just distal tothe extensor process and near the distal tip of thethird phalanx. It consists of horn wall andthe opaque dermal/epidermal zone that borders the horn and the laminae. Ranges of normal vary de-pending on type and size of the horse and so thismeasurement is best used when comparing serialradiographs over time. It is also important to mea-sure both the horn (H) and lamellar (L) zone sepa-rately, as signicant, life-threatening lamellarswelling can occur without rotation. One must alsoconsider that the horn portion of the HL can bedrastically altered by the farrier in an attempt tomake the foot look normal and so measuring the HL Fig. 7. A, Yearling with a Grade 2 club, 55\u00b0 bone angle that was 5\u00b0 larger than the opposite foot and a 15\u00b0 capsule PA. This could be a good candidate for the check desmotomy but will always have a slightly steeper foot than its opposite due to bone angle. B, Thisfoot has a 45\u00b0 bone angle and a positive capsule PA but appears as a long toe underrun heel foot. C, This weanling had a 60\u00b0 boneangle, 10\u00b0 greater than the opposite foot. HL zone, 15/10 mm and a 5\u00b0 PA. The opposite foot had a 50\u00b0 bone angle and zero PA and15/10 HL zone. This was a 20\u00b0 difference in hoof angles. This appearance would lead one to believe a check desmotomy was highlyindicated. Unfortunately, that would only result in a 5\u00b0 advantage due to the low PA still leaving a 15\u00b0 difference in toe angles,therefore surgery would not be very benecial both functionally and cosmetically. 394 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO MANAGE HOOF LAMENESS IIby itself can be misleading unless used in conjunc- tion with other soft tissue parameters. In the past, \"capsule rotation\" was considered pa- thognomonic for laminitis; however, other commonfoot issues result in horn alterations that may re-semble laminitis at rst glance, yet not involvethe laminae. For example, white-line disease fre-quently has capsule rotation radiographically but asa rule, the disease process is limited to the horn walland the laminae only become altered to some degreein the ultra-chronic case. Clinically, white-line dis-ease can resemble laminitis and require similar me-chanical benets as the wall is also an antagonist tothe DDFT, and once it loses its natural function dueto invading bacteria and fungi, the wall fails to re-sist the relentless pull of the tendon. Radiograph-ically, the gas line is distinctly different from white-line disease as it is within the inner non-pigmentedhorn, starts at the ground surface and has an erraticpattern of destruction. The etiology of capsule ro-tation and lesion intensity sets the stage for specicshoeing recommendations and goals. The farriershould be involved with formulating the mechanicalplan based on the radiographic data that relatesspecically to the trim, shoe design, and application. Digital Breakover Digital breakover is the distance from a vertical linedrawn at the tip of the cofn bone and 90\u00b0 to thepoint of break-over or the most dorsal location ofthe solar aspect of the hoof or shoe that contacts theground. The point of break-over can be variablebased on whether or not the shoe is flat or has aradius (rocker-type shoe). It is common practice toback the toe up to enhance break-over and to makethe low-prole foot with crushed heel appear to havea stronger toe angle. Unfortunately, it is not aproblem with the toe but a stark loss of heel mass.The natural heel-to-toe ratio is out of balance andreducing the strategic strength of the dorsal wall forthe sake of making the heel appear stronger can becounterproductive. This practice fails to remark-ably improve mechanics and it can be counterpro-ductive (Fig. 8). Medial/Lateral Balance Balance is dened as even distribution of weight.This term is frequently used by farriers and vetswith a wide range of interpretation based on a vari-ety of external and radiographic reference points.Even though subjective and without regard to soledepth, bone asymmetry, and PA, it is commonlythought that radiographic medial/lateral imbalanceof the solar rim of the cofn bone is the cause forunsoundness. Therefore, oftentimes the farrier isinstructed or inclined to remove foot on the longerside and/or add shims to the lower side in an effort toleave the wings horizontal with the ground surface.Unfortunately, when the foot has less than adequatemass (depth of sole and heel) removing more solethat is the rst line of defense for the underlyingsensitive structures is counterproductive. Discre-tion is due as there are more points of interest toconsider when assessing static radiographic bal-ance. The DP view for podiatry issues requires as-tute attention to assure the horse is standing assquare as possible, with each foot on a proper posi-tioning block and with the head straight forward toassure the most accurate representation of rim andjoint balance. The slightest shift of load will alterboth rim and joint balance. Cofn bone asymmetryfrequently occurs with toe out conformation. Oftenthere is less sole depth medial versus lateral and thebone is remarkably smaller in the vertical and hor-izontal plane than the lateral half. A large major-ity of these will also have medial joint listing alongthe same plane as the solar rim. Despite the ver-tical bone asymmetry and/or medial listing, the jointspace will often be uniform. This description ofimbalance can be consistent with sound, top athletichorses provided they have adequate foot mass.A more descriptive term may be natural imbalanceas it is apparent that it is the result of permanentcongenital limb and hoof deformities that we aren'tgoing to change but can manage the ill effects (Fig. 9and Fig. 10). The growth rings along the medial lateral quarter will also reflect a despairing rate of growth betweenthem when load distribution is altered by undesir-able limb conformation. The excessively loadedside will have less distance between the rings.This decit in medial wall growth is consistent withthe lighter breeds that have toe-out conformationdue to a valgus carpus, outward rotation of the en-tire limb (extorsion), or both. When the conforma-tion defect is more severe, a pushed up or displacedmedial heel with this conformation can be seen aswell. The pushed up or displaced heel is oftenerroneously referred to as a sheared heel. Thepushed-up heel remains rmly attached to the op-posing quarter, whereas the sheared heel no longerremains rmly attached to the adjoining heel bulb Fig. 8. The lateral image reveals that the wall was backed up with a rasp along the distal 2/3 of the dorsal face. Note thelocation of the dermal/epidermal opaque line relative to what wasremoved. The dorsal wall is the thickest and apparently themost strategic part of the capsule and removing it has little if anybenet. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 395HOW TO IIand can be quite easily manipulated proximately. It has long been assumed by horsemen, farriers, andveterinarians that the heel bulb is a reflection ofmedial/lateral wing balance and correcting it usingthe heel bulb length as reference requires loweringthat side of the foot. However, a DP radiographwill reveal the opposite has occurred. The wing ofP3 is already lower and lowering further is counter-productive. Radiographic information can be vitalfor success as relying on external landmarks alonecan be misleading (Fig. 11). For example, the me-dial and lateral sulci can be valuable landmarks forthe farrier as they attempt to balance the heels, butonly if the cofn bone is symmetrical. The sulci arevery close to the plane of the concave surface of thecofn bone, as well as the wings that form the pal-mar rim on radiographs.5. Radiographs Are Not Just for Planning Clients should be made aware of the value of radio- graphic assessment throughout the mechanical ap-plication as this information assures the detailedplan is followed as closely as possible. Radiographs before shoeing set the planning stage. Images pro- duced during the trim and various stages in the application of the mechanical aid are often indicated even for the most experienced podiatrists. The im- ages made of the nal application are of utmost value as they either conrm or disconrm that theplan was followed and offer baseline values for thenext exam. Comparative exams should be performed with each reset for the cases that remain in the healingand or rehab status. By comparing images taken Fig. 9. A, Right front natural medial listing of the palmar rim, cofn, and pastern joints with even joint spaces. Note also that the metacarpophalangeal joint slopes medial to lateral. This is a distinguishing point of interest that conrms the left from the right footunless the images are flipped, another valid reason to never flip images. B, The left foot of the same horse in panel A. This is thesteeper foot of the mismatched pair; note the bone shape and the apex is remarkably lower than the wings, evidence of a higher PA.There is evidence of imbalance as the medial side of the cofn and pastern joint is narrower than the lateral side. To balance the cofnand pastern joints, the medial side of the foot should be lowered accordingly. C, This horse has an extensive medial listing of thepastern and cofn joints and palmar rim. However, this horse becomes sound when the lateral side of his foot is lowered just enoughto balance the joints but not enough to make the palmar rim parallel with the sole. The external hoof characteristics offer no clue tothis degree of congenital imbalance. Fig. 10. A, Asymmetrical cofn bone likely secondary to load-induced changes to the medial side of the cofn bone secondary to aconformational wide stance. Note pastern angle and the symmetric joint spaces. B, The palmar rim is parallel with the ground butthere is narrowing of the cofn joint (circled in red). C, Hind foot with plantar rim balance but an asymmetrical cofn bone and secondphalanx. The above examples reveal the value of radiographic data when foot issues occur. 396 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO MANAGE HOOF LAMENESS IIat each reset it is possible to recognize where treat- ments have worked and also when there is digres- sion or no response. This can be particularlybenecial in treatment of life-threatening syn-dromes. Radiographs used in this fashion for path-ological shoeing provide a progressive learningcurve for the veterinary/farrier team. 6. Conclusion Career and life-threatening foot issues that requirepathological trimming and shoeing continue to be acommon occurrence in equine practice and requiresthe services of a farrier to apply the mechanicalmanipulation to the hoof via trim and/or shoe ormechanical aid in an effort to enhance the healingenvironment. Determining exactly what the far-rier has to work with relative to goals and mechan-ical decits of specic suspension and/or supportcomponents is critical to determining an appropriatetreatment plan for the horse. Consistently measur-ing parameters as accurately as possible can helpdevelop the eye for the slightest alteration from thatof healthy feet of various ages and breeds. The goalof the team is to develop instinctive skills that cor-relate the internal parameters with external char-acteristics. Using the image as a guide forplanning the trim lines and specics of the shoe canreveal flaws in the plan as well as other options.Cellular phones that offer a pen are an asset for theteam to sketch their plans over the digital radio-graphs. The farrier should understand the impor-tance of processing the information to his or herhands and the rasp. It is one thing to observe pro-posed trim lines and a shoe superimposed over thelateral radiograph but quite another to fully under-stand that the trim should mimic the sketch. Tak-ing lateral and DP views during the trim processhelps adhere to the specics of the plan and preventsover trimming that can drastically alter the plan aswell as the outcome. Understanding how to thinkthrough the mechanical requirements and develop-ing a realistic strategy is dependent on radiographsthat are critical for both the veterinarian and farrierto know how to manage the case.

Introduction Despite signicant research and recent ndings over the past decade, a complete understanding oflaminitis and its complex pathophysiological pro-cesses remain uncertain. Preventative measure-ments and strategies of this devastating diseaseremain largely empirical and anecdotal with littleinformation from evidence-based medicine. Re-cent technological advances offer some promisestowards the effective treatment or the rehabilita-tion process of the laminitic horse. Laminitis canbe one of the most frustrating, but rewarding dis-eases to treat. Anyone interested in working with foot problems in the horse must have aneffective strategy for treating the laminitic horse.It is these cases in particular which are in themost need of veterinary expertise. There are afew instances when there is the opportunity todramatically improve the quality of an animal'slife. With the appropriate treatment approach, alarge proportion of laminitic horses can be reha-bilitated to pasture soundness, light use, and evensome degree of athletic performance. 1However, some advanced cases cannot be rehabilitated to anacceptable level of comfort and therefore euthana-sia is advised to prevent needless suffering. If the distal phalanx continues to displace and/or if the foot fails to show continuous improvementdened as hoof growth with shoeing mechanicsalone, oftentimes a deep flexor (DDF) tenot- omy is warranted. A DDF tenotomy is the fastest way to counteract the forces at play and restoreperfusion and tissue mass to the dorsal regions ofthe foot (Fig. 1). These feet generally respond withsignicant distal dorsal sole growth at the tip of thecofn bone over 4-6 weeks (Fig. 2). One of the most signicant developments not only in the evaluation and treatment of laminitis but alsounderstanding the mechanics of the foot in generalhas been the venogram: a simple but technique sen-sitive procedure that allows visualization of the vas-cular tree of the foot. 2-4The venogram has become an invaluable tool that also allows visualization of the effects of pathology and various treatment con-cepts, making it one of the most valuable tools fordiagnosis and treatment strategy. 5The venogram provides the rst detectable evidence that conrmslaminitis, clearly distinguishing it from other syn-dromes with similar clinical signs, and reveals thedamaging effects of laminitis earlier in the syn-drome than radiographs. Having this informationat the time of rst clinical signs or shortly there- after allows a treatment window with the largestresponse, enhancing the ability to make more timely decisions concerning reversal therapy and also pro-viding a baseline that facilitates monitoring the ef-ciency of the chosen treatment regimen. This canoffer a much more favorable prognosis than wait- 398 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW has occurred. By re-establishing vascular perfusion, the ulti- mate goal is to maintain health of the cofn bone and eventually re-establish normal cofn bone align-ment and adequate sole depth. Transection of theDDF tendon allows immediate re-alignment of thecofn bone in relation to the ground surface. Tim-ing of the DDF tenotomy and re-alignment shoeingprocedure is critical. The procedure should beperformed before the patient experiences ad-vanced structural failure. The most important Fig. 1.

Combination of surgery with the appropriate trimand therapeutic shoeing is imperative for long-term success. Performing the DDF tenotomywithout realignment shoeing of the hoof capsulewill have a short-term clinical improvement andmost likely won't affect the survival rate. 1 Transection of the DDF tendon is a controversial treatment for chronic laminitis largely because ofthe variation in personal experience with the proce-dure and the varying success rates reported in pre-viously published data. 1Differences in reported success rates are more likely because of the dissim-ilarities in foot pathology and the foot managementassociated with the procedure. Outcomes are de-termined based on the degree of bone disease, solarpenetration, degrees of rotation, sinking (distal dis-placement of the cofn bone but no rotation), num-ber of limbs involved, and front or hind feet affected.There are several issues to consider when makingthe decision to perform a DDF tenotomy: initialdamage assessment, short- and long-term goals ofthe client, aftercare capabilities and responsibilitiesof the caretakers, mechanical knowledge, and skilllevel of the farrier and veterinarian relative to thepatient, and nancial impact. The DDF tenotomyhas often been viewed merely as a salvage proce-dure. It is only considered late in case manage-ment and is often performed without considering thebenets of repositioning the palmar/plantar (hereinreferred to as palmar) and the articular surface ofthe cofn bone with healthy load zones. However,if performed early in case management, at the rstindication that the vascular supply is not respond-ing to optimum mechanics before permanent dam-age occurs, the DDF tenotomy can greatly enhancethe prognosis by increasing the potential for rapidvascular reperfusion to severely compressed ar-eas. This can preserve the integrity of the pal-mar rim and optimize solar and tubular papillaefunction, which accelerates sole and horn growth. Transection of the DDF tendon as a treatment for chronic laminitis has been reported with variablesuccess rates in the previously published data.Eastman et al 6reported the results of 35 cases between 1988 and 1997. A total of 77% of the casessurvived a minimum of 6 months, and 59% survived/H110222 years. Allen et al 7reported on 13 cases. Five of these (39%) returned to limited athletic activity,six (46%) were pasture sound, and the remainingtwo cases (15%) improved initially but were eventu-ally euthanized (one due to further deteriorationafter 9 months, and the other due to economic rea-sons). Hunt et al 8reported the experience with 20 cases. In these cases, 55% survived less than 1month, 30% survived longer than 6 months, 15% ofthese remained lame. None of the cases in that studyreturned to athletic performance. These studies hada large variation in case specics and included thedegree of cofn bone injury at presentation, chronicity,shoeing and/or trimming protocols at the time theDDF tenotomy was performed, and follow-up care. In Hunt's study, there were several cases which allreceived the same shoeing protocol and postsurgicalfoot management. To better evaluate the efcacy of the tenotomy procedure, Morrison 9subclassied 245 cases that received a DDF tenotomy into the following catego-ries: degree of displacement of the cofn bone, cof-n bone disease, medial, lateral, or vertical sinkingof the cofn, and cofn bone that penetrated thesole. 5Of the 245 cases, 51% were considered a success. Success was dened as survival for /H110221 year after surgery, maintaining good body condition,and an Obel lameness Grade of 2 or less (movingfreely at the walk but possibly having a stiff gait,sore on turning, and able to pick up each foot whenasked). Cases with no cofn bone disease and nosigns of sinking or solar penetration had an 83%success rate. Cases with moderate cofn bone dis-ease, and no sinking or solar penetration had a 93%success rate. Cases with severe cofn bone diseaseand no sinking or penetration had a 44% successrate. Cases with signs of sinking (medial, lateral,or vertical) had an overall success rate of 18%, while non-sinkers had a success rate of 71%. Cases with penetration and no sinking had an 88%success rate while cases with penetration andsinking had a 25% success rate. The number oflimbs involved and their location was also associ-ated with outcome: success rate for one limb was52%; two limbs, 50%; four limbs, 50%; front limb,51%; and hind limbs, 50%. During laminitis and the rehabilitation process, it is important to minimize further damage to the foot.As a team, the veterinarian and farrier should havean understanding of the normal supporting struc-tures of the digit, biomechanical forces on the foot,and the structural failure that results when theseforces act on a diseased and damaged foot. In a healthy foot, the antagonistic forces between thelaminae that support the cofn bone dorsally andthe deep DDF that pull palmarly are in bal-ance. In the laminitic foot, these forces are out ofbalance due to the loss of dorsal laminar support.This allows the unopposed palmar force of the DDFtendon to pull the cofn bone away from the hoofcapsule and creates instability. Venograms clearlyoutline the blood circulation in the foot, and perfu-sion decits that are a consequence of laminitis.This is an invaluable diagnostic that could help withprognosis. The clinical information gained from a physical examination of the foot, venograms, andradiographs will dictate which treatment modali-ties need to be implemented. The multitude ofprognostic factors that affect outcome in the horsewith laminitis make treating these cases a chal-lenge. Treating the horse with laminitis requiresexperience, expertise, realistic expectations, and aunied effort by the farrier, veterinarian, andowner. 400 HOOF LAMENESS IISerial venograms play a major role in the decision to perform a DDF tenotomy as it can reveal clear evidence that the vascular damage has progressedbeyond the benets of optimum mechanical treat- ment (Fig. 3). The information obtained will clearlydistinguish the case that was tted with an efcientmechanical aid at the onset of the syndrome fromthe case that was not. The value of frequent veno-grams to monitor the integrity of the blood supply,especially in the absence of remarkable growth, isthe best way to detect the reason for horn growthdecit. Most cases with moderate to severe vascu-lar damage will not have noticeable horn growth forthe rst 30 to 45 days even with mechanical aid, andwill not have detectable rotation of the cofn bone.Without the diagnostic benet of a venogram, essen-tial information about perfusion will delay surgeryby several weeks, causing the optimum treatmentperiod to be missed. Waiting for the horse to de-velop complications such as seromas/abscesses dueto the vascular damage, which occurs approximately6 to 8 weeks from onset of clinical signs, to makesurgical decisions can save lives for a while but signif-icant irreversible damage sets the stage for ongoingcomplications and often euthanasia. When there islittle if any growth 30 days post onset it is most probable that there is declining vascular supply inspite of the soundless level. 5Do not rely on the pain scale to assess progress as it can be verydeceptive. 5 The role of the venogram is pivotal to proper case management and outcomes. Assessing internaldamage with the venogram allows a better under-standing of the correlation between the vascularpattern and healing response and how the mechan-ical component greatly influences both. Usingsheer mechanics and shifting the load from the dor-sal half of the foot palmarly to the heel proves to bethe most reliable means of treating the laminitichorse. Doing so expeditiously, ideally before thedestructive cycle to the blood supply has causedirreversible damage to soft tissue growth centersand the palmar rim including the respective termi-nal papillae, can p roduce favorable results in a large majority of cases. 10Prognosis is related principally to vascular integrity and damage atthe time of insult. Vascular compromise createssoft tissue damage, followed by mechanical dis-ruption of the equilibrium between the supportiveforces of the laminae and tensile force of the DDFtendon. Timing of treatment and a DDF tenec-tomy is essential for an optimal outcome byquickly re-establishing healthy vascular supply,which can prevent the mechanical phase from de-stroying the suspension network. Realignment shoeing is also known as derotation shoeing 6(Fig. 4). Transection of the DDF tendon allowed immediate realignment of the cofn bonerelative to the ground surface. The goal for therealignment shoeing was to apply a tenotomy railbar shoe aonto the foot to re-establish parallel align- ment of the ground surface and the cofn bone.Additionally, the shoe should have a heel extensionto prevent the distal interphalangeal joint from dor-si-flexing after transection of the tendon. The pal-mar extension of the shoe should be continued to a Fig. 3.

The heel ex-tension serves to improve sole mechanics by pro-viding additional support to the palmar aspect ofthe foot. The sole support material bis then mixed and applied to the sole. The shoe is thenrmly placed onto the foot at the same angle as thesolar surface of P3 as viewed on the radiographs.At this point, the sole support material was oftenmolded into a toe wedge to achieve proper shoealignment. Once the proper angle is achieved,the shoe is glued in place using berglass clothimpregnated with the adhesive cleaving the toe open to minimize the chances for abscess forma-tion which can be caused when the toe is covered with the adhesive material. Successful management of the laminitic horse begins with the understanding of the normal sup-porting structures of the digit, the disease process,vascular compromise, and the structural failure thatresults in the laminitic foot. An early accurate di-agnosis, and appropriate treatment are imperativefor a successful outcome. Rehabilitation of thelaminitic horse requires a dedicated team and coop-erative efforts between the farrier, veterinarian,and owner. As with any surgical and therapeuticprocedure, timing and proper case selection are es-sential for the best long-term outcome. The infor-mation presented here provides useful informationthat can assist the equine professionals in formulat-ing a prognosis for laminitis cases requiring theDDF tenotomy and the realignment shoeing proce-dure. To be qualied as a competent equine podi-atrist is one of the most rewarding and treasuredcredential that a pathological focused farrier or vet-erinarian could possess. Saving the career or life ofa horse that is suffering from developmental compli-cations can be one of the most gratifying experiencesone could ever have.

The distal interphalangeal joint (DIP) is the major articulation of the digit. It is the center of articu-lation about which many structures of the distallimb act upon during locomotion. The DIP joint istherefore considered a focal point of the digit and isa major landmark when assessing hoof form, func-tion, and balance. The DIP joint, being the distalmost joint of the limb, is most affected by asymmet-rical loading patterns when ambulating on uneventerrain and is also greatly influenced by foot manip-ulations, such as trimming and shoeing. The rangeof motion is higher than the proximal interphalan- geal (pastern) joint. At the trot, the range of mo-tion of the cofn joint has been shown to be 47\u00b0 andthe pastern joint 35\u00b0. 1,2The DIP joint is the articulations of the distal phalanx, distal endof the middle phalanx, and the two articular sur-faces of the navicular bone (Figs. 1 and 2). The joint is stabilized by soft-tissue structures: the common digital extensor tendon acts to extendthe DIP joint as it courses down the dorsal pastern,combines with the extensor branches of the suspen-sory ligament, and inserts on to the extensor processof the distal phalanx. The the dorsal pastern and isadhered to the joint capsules of the and DIPjoint, and the ungual cartilages. The extensor ten-don acts to the dorsal aspect of the joint andprevents dorsal luxation of the joint (Fig. 2). The palmar aspect of the joint is stabilized largely bythe deep digital flexor tendon (Figs. 1, 3, and 4) andthe impar ligament, which originates on the distalend of the navicular bone and inserts on the distalphalanx just proximal to the deep digital flexor ten-don (DDFT) on the semilunar crest. Thesuspensory the navicular bone also aidin stabilizing the palmar/plantar aspect of the joint.The lateral and medial regions of the joint are sta-bilized primarily by the collateral ligaments (Fig. 5),and the chondrocoronal (attached collateral liga-ment to ungual cartilage). The joint capsule assistsin stabilizing the entire joint (Fig. 4). The DIP joint is primarily designed to move in flexion and extension; however, there are rotational/transverse plane and collateral /frontal plane move-ments as well. These planes of motion allow thejoint to tolerate uneven ground. It is believed thatexcessive rotational and collateromotion are thecause of excessive wear and tear on the articularsurfaces. To limit the stress on the joint and max-imize foot function, maintaining a balanced foot pro-portioned around the center of rotation of the DIP isnecessary. Joints have a limited and slow rate of repair. 3 When joint damage accumulates and outpaces the repair process, clinical manifestations of joint dis-ease arise. Gross and histological changes in os- 404 2020 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW synovial in- flammation, and periarticular brosis.4Fig. 6 shows a normal DIP joint on the left and an abnor-mal joint on the right, with cartilage erosions and aninflamed and thickened joint capsule. Damage to the DIP joint can be caused by an acute injury to the joint or peri-articular supporting struc-tures or can be from chronic wear and tear. De-grees of lameness can be variable depending on thenature and extent of the damage. Cases presentwith variable degrees of sensitivity over the frogregion. Distension of the joint can usually be de-tected by palpation of the dorsal pouch just proximalto the coronary band. Palpable joint distension isnot pathognomonic for DIP joint disease. Joint dis-tension can occur secondary to any cause of footinflammation. It is common to detect joint disten-sion with foot abscesses, fractures, soft-tissue inju-ries, and severe bruising. Cases typically have apositive response to lower-limb flexion and areworse on hard surfaces. Diagnostic analgesia is re-quired to accurately diagnose the DIP joint as asource of pain. The DIP joint blocks out with apalmar digital nerve (PDN) block (along with mostof the structures of the foot 5). Intrasynovial anal- gesia of the DIP joint will desensitize the joint, butover time will also desensitize the navicular appa-ratus and toe region of the sole. It is believed thata positive response to DIP joint analgesia within5-10 minute is most likely the joint. After 10 min-utes, diffusion of anesthetic will begin to desensitizeother structures. Navicular bursa analgesia is dif-cult to perform in some cases, but is fairly specicfor desensitizing the navicular apparatus without Fig. 1.

Lateral view of the digit displaying the anatomical struc-tures stabilizing the distal interphalangeal joint. LAMENESS negative response to navicular bursa analgesia and a positiveresponse to DIP joint analgesia is a strong indicationthat the DIP joint is the source of pain. Radio-graphs in acute cases rarely show much. In chroniccases, osteophytes, narrowed joint spaces, subchon-dral sclerosis, and enlarged syn ovial invaginations on distal border of navicular bone are all signs of joint disease. MRI is very helpful in evaluating theextent of the cartilage damage and peri-articularstructures. MRI is also helpful in determining ac-tive inflammation and physiology of the adjacentbone. Treatment of cofn joint disease involves manag- ing the inflammation and its destructive action onthe cartilage. Systemic and intra-articular anti-inflammatories, hyaluronic acid, and polysulfatedglycosaminoglycan (PGAG)s are used. 6Acute con- ditions require rest and rehabilitation whereaschronic conditions require a more lon g-term man- agement program. Severe cases may require a decrease in performance level or retirement. Sys-temic or articular treatments with steroids, hyal-uronic acid (HA), and PGAGs have been shown to beof clinical benet in decreasing inflammation andmaintaining joint health. Special attention totrimming and shoeing is most likely to have thebiggest impact, especially in cases with poor confor-mation or foot-balance issues. Trimming to establish even loading medial to lat- eral is the goal. Radiographs should be used incases with a history of DIP disease, to help establisha balanced trim. Trimming perpendicular to thelong axis of the pastern is recommended when ra-diographs are not available. When shoeing, pre-serving the natural function of the foot is the goal.Taking into consideration the shock absorbingmechanism and loading characteristics of a healthybarefoot. There are several mechanisms in place to accom- modate shock absorption: 1) hoof wall, 2) lamellarinterface, 3) soft tissue (joint, joint capsule, sole co-rium, digital cushion, tendon/ligament, bone), and 4)movement of blood into and out of the foot. Whenthe foot is loaded, the elastic hoof capsule deforms,soft tissue is compressed and stretched, and theelastic/pliable lamellar interface allows the bone col-umn to displace slightly within the hoof capsule.A well-formed hoof capsule with proper mass, shape,and moisture content are the foundation for a well-functioning foot. As the foot is loaded, the compression and tension within the foot squeezes the blood out of the foot andhelps drive it up the limb through low-resistancevascular pathways in the collateral cartilages.The structure most responsible for transmitting ex-ternal shock into movement of blood are the bars,digital cushion, and collateral cartilages. It hasbeen hypothesized, by Dr. Rooney, 7as the heels impact the ground, the bars receive vibrations andforce, which then transmits it to the collateral car-tilages, which lie just deep to the bars (Fig. 7).The collateral cartilages are rich in vasculature andcontain a pool of blood, which receives these vibra-tions and converts it to the movement of fluid/bloodup the limb. Basically, the collateral cartilage andits vasculature provide a low-resistance pathway forthe rapid movement of blood out of the foot duringground impact, acting as a hydraulic shock absorber.Feet, which are efcient at shock absorption, havethick, robust collateral cartilages (with abundant Fig. 5. Probe inserted into the collateral ligament of the distal interphalangeal joint. Fig. 6.

Caudal view of the dissected foot revealing the digitalcushion and collateral (ungual) cartilages. 406 IIvasculature), well-developed digital cushion, and strong, well-developed bars. This is one example of why feet must have proper form to function. This simply means that the ana-tomical structures need to be of proper mass andspatial arrangement to execute the sequence ofevents needed to accommodate the dissipation ofvibrations generated during ground impact and sup-port the weight of the horse. There are severalgoals that should be achieved in order to promote ahealthy and functioning hoof (Fig. 8): 1) The centerof rotation (red dot) should be lined up with thecenter of the weight-bearing surface of the foot.The center of rotation can easily be identied on thefoot, because it usually corresponds to the widestpart of the sole. 2) A positive palmar/plantar angle(blue line), ideally between 2\u00b0 and 5\u00b0. 3) Adequatesole depth, ideally the sole depth would equal thethickness of the Horn-Lamellar thickness (yellowlines). 4) Heel position should be at the widest partof the frog (orange circle). 5) The moment arm act-ing on the DIP joint needs to be appropriate. Themoment arm is simply the length between the jointaxis and the point of force, in this instance theground surface of the shoe. This means they needto be long enough to provide support and stabilitybut short enough to prevent excessive leverage andtorque on the joint and supporting structures. Thedegree of leverage reduction combined with thepitch (how steep and elevated the angle of roll is onthe shoe) dictate how much stress is reduced butalso how unstable the foot functions as a platform orbase of support. Fig. 9 shows shoes with medial/lateral leverage reduction, the image on the left ismore suitable as a therapeutic shoe, whereas theimage on the right would be more suitable as aperformance shoe.Shoeing Around the Cofn Joint in the Sagittal Plane An underrun heel, where the heels are migratedforward and consequently the entire foot includingthe toe also migrate forward. As a result, the footbecomes out of balance in the sagittal plane, mean-ing that the weight-bearing surface of the foot is nolonger centered around the COR. This imbalancecreates dysfunction in the shock absorbing and sup-porting roles of the foot. In this common scenariothe bars and collateral cartilages are not lined upand cannot absorb shock as well as a foot with well-positioned heels that line up with the collateral car-tilages (Fig. 10, A-C). When a foot has properform, it is \"balanced.\" Fig 10A is an example of awell-balanced foot with ideal heel position and nor-mal proportions to the weight bearing structures ofthe foot. Figs 10B and C are feet with under-runheels. The weight-bearing portion of the heels aremigrated forward and no longer line up with theshock absorbing mechanism of the foot. Causes of Under-Run Heels Arches and straight lines are strong architecturalshapes. Strong feet have a sole arch and straightwalls. Sigh ting the foot from the coronary band, the walls should be straight without flares or dishes.When feet become weak and distorted the sole archtypically flattens and the walls bend, creating dis-tortions. Hoof capsule distortion refers to misshap-en/imbalanced hooves such as flares, cracks, under-run, collapsed, and sheared heels, all of which are aresult of long-term abnormal weight distribution onthe foot. Distortions affect function and have beenshown to be correlated to musculoskeletal injuriesand lameness. 8-11 Distortions are a result of either overloading a healthy structure, causing it to collapse or bend, orcan be the result of underloading a structure, suchas the case of a contracted heel on a clubfoot. Inthis case the heel is underloaded and the toe isoverloaded, causing the heel to contract and the toeto bend or dish. Distortions can also result fromdisease processes, such as laminitis, where the hoofwall in the toe region is separated, creating flares or Fig. 8. Diagram illustrating and demarcating key areas to be evaluated when formulating a shoeing plan (sole depth, heelposition, palmar/planter angle, and center of rotation). Fig. 9. Anterior-posterior radiographic view of two examples ofshoes with medial/lateral leverage Fungal infections or white-line disease can also cause weakening of the hoof and subsequentdistortion. In the case of the Thoroughbred race-horse and other disciplines, a lot of stress is put onthe hooves, therefore, it is necessary to have ahealthy structure that is put under repetitive highloads. Speed training puts high force on the heels,which lowers the hoof angle over time. As the an-gle gets lower, more force is placed on the heel,creating a vicious cycle that can be difcult to cor-rect. The combination of a lighter hoof with thin-ner hoof wall and sole depth combined with rigorousspeed training makes the Thoroughbred hoof sus-ceptible to distortions such as under-run heels,quarter cracks, crushed heels, and sheared/shuntedheels (Fig. 11). The heel region of the hoof is softerand more pliable than the toe and is designed todissipate shock. The heel houses such structuresas the collateral cartilages, digital cushion, and anabundant vascular system, all designed to absorbshock. The toe is more rigid, designed to penetratethe ground to establish traction. Since the heel ismore pliable and hits the ground rst, hoof distor- tions typically present here rst. Many heel problems tend to be reoccurring. This is because the primary problem has not been effectivelycorrected. Having knowledge of the etiology of a footproblem will help formulate a successful treatmentplan to heal the condition, prevent reoccurrence, andimprove the longevity and wellbeing of the horse. The most common hoof capsule distortion is the under-run heel. The horn tubules in the heel be-come bent forward, making the heel grow more for-ward at an acute angle rather than down. Thishoof capsule distortion makes it particularly dif-cult to shoe around the center of articulation as theentire hoof migrates forward. It can be argued thatthe under-run heel is caused by the act of shoeingalone in which a normal hoof's natural wear is pre-vented. The hoof wall grows in length over theshoeing cycle, increasing toe length and decreasinghoof wall angle over time. 12As the toe grows long, it pulls the heels forward. When due to be shodagain, the foot is trimmed and rebalanced to startthe entire process all over again. This continuousrepetitive process trains the horn tubules to migrateforward. Other considerations with shoeing, is thealteration in the foot's loading pattern. In the un-shod foot, load is distributed to the sole, bars, frog,and hoof wall, whereas the shod foot load is primar-ily concentrated on the hoof wall. Although whenin soft footing the shod foot will incorporate the sole,bars, and frog into weight bearing. Some may argue: since horses train on soft foot- ing, which packs into the foot and loads the sole,bars, and frog, doesn't this offset the effect of theshoe overloading the hoof wall? Sport horses spendthe majority of their time standing in a straw ordry-shavings bedded stall. It is during this periodthat the foot is m ostly dependent on the architecture of the foot tissues for support. Long-term, low-mag-nitude loading creates distortion rather than short-term, high-magnitude force. 13Horses standing in a Fig. 10. Three different feet showing variations in heel contour (A is ideal, images B and C are under-run or forward migration of the heels). Fig. 11.

The insidious nature of a hoofcapsule distortion slowly compromises the foot, ren-dering it more susceptible to an acute injury. The horse's foot is capable of handling huge im- pact forces without structurally collapsing. This isdue to the fact that when a horse is traveling, themoving foot lls with blood during the swing phase.Probably from centrifugal force lling the non- weight-bearing tissue maximally with blood, creat-ing turgor pressure. This fluid in closed spacesmay help support the architecture of the foot duringground impact. It is with the help of this mecha-nism that the foot is able to withstand high-impactforces. Most hoof capsule deformities (under-run,collapsed heels) slowly develop over time. It is inthe author's experience that most of these distor-tions occur while the foot is semi-static (while thehorse is just standing around). Prevention and Treatment of the Under-Run Heel Prevention of a dysfunctional heel begins as a foal.The foal is born with a small, soft hoof. The solarsurface is smaller in circumference than the coro-nary band. The soft, contracted hoof is a normaladaption to prevent injury to the mares' birth canalduring the birthing process. If you look at a new-born foal's hoof you will see they are born with anunder-run heel (Fig. 12). In nature, the newbornfoal quickly becomes very mobile and the abrasive terrain quickly wears the horn away to achieve a nor-mal heel position. The heel position should betrimmed back to the widest part of the frog at eachtrimming. Care should be taken not to trim the heeltoo low creating soreness and sole bruising. Ideally,the growing horse should remain barefoot as long aspossible to encourage a strong well-adapted heel.The most important element in preventing a com- promised heel from occurring is maintaining idealweight-bearing proportions to the weight-bearingsurface of the foot. Recognizing a compromisedheel and addressing it before it creates lameness issues is paramount to a successful foot-manage-ment program. The rst morphological sign of an overloaded heel is a frog that begins to prolapse orbreak the plane of the solar surface of the hoof wall(Fig. 13). The wall in the heel region begins to col-lapse or recede as it is overloaded, and the frog planebecomes lower than the hoof wall. Another sign ofexcessive heel concussion are hairs that begin to raiseand irritation/dermatitis of the heel bulbs (Fig. 11). The most effective way to rehabilitate a weakened or compromised heel is to go barefoot for a period oftime. The frog plane improves and the under-runheel position corrects quickly. Often, this is notpossible and cases will need shoes to stay sound fortraining and competition. In this instance, shoeingmodalities that mimic the barefoot condition arerequired to manage and rehabilitate the heel struc-tures. Figure 14 shows a race lly's foot before andafter going barefoot for 3 months. Notice the im-proved heel position, weight-bearing proportions,and overall shape of the foot. There are severalfeatures of the barefoot condition that can be simu- Fig. 12. Ten-day-old foal foot showing the typical under-run heel conformation of a newborn. Fig. 13.

AAEP /H11408Vol. MANAGE HOOF LAMENESS IIlated with shoeing to create a similar effect. These features are frog support, rolled heel, rolled toe,broad toe shape. If you look closely at a healthybarefoot, you will notice the foot is not completelyflat. The heels and the toe are rolled slightly.The rolled heel helps decrease excessive concussiongenerated during heel rst landing. The rolled toe helps decrease resistance to break- over and allows the foot to rollover in any directionthat is the least stressful for that limb's conformation(Fig. 15). The rolled heels provide the ability to improve the heel position, by trimming the heels back to thewidest part of the frog without invading sole massbeneath the wing of the pedal bone. Horses need asmuch protection beneath the wing of the bone aspossible. This is a common area of soreness in ath-letes. If the entire foot level and the heels weretrimmed back to the widest part of the frog, then thetrim would take away too much sole depth. Thelast component is frog support, which is best done byadding a heart bar, frog cradle, stabilizer plate, ther-moplastic form-tting heel pad, or in some cases,temporary orthotics/sole support (Fig. 16). Manytrainers do not like the added weight and decreased traction created with a bar shoe, therefore othermechanical solutions to deal with this problem mustbe found. One option is to train in the bar shoe andswitch to a normal race plate on race day or shortlybefore. Some cases experience some discomfortwith a metal bar or heart-bar. Perhaps the weightof the limb coming down on a metal unyielding bar istoo rm for some feet. A thermoplastic heel plate isoften tolerated well by even the most sensitive feet. The thermoplastic pad is heated and molded to theheel area. The thermoplastic is rm enough to pro-vide adequate support but yields and flexes slightly. Temporary orthotics are sole support materials that are placed or wrapped in the soles while thehorse is in the stall and then removed when out ofthe stall. The concept is to provide arch/sole sup-port while the horse is in the stall and allow thehorse to train in a normal shoe. This is a 2-partelastomer dental impression putty that is used tomake a custom orthotic or arch support for each foot.The removable orthotics are placed into the feet andwrapped in place with Vetwrap. The orthotics canbe removed for training and placed back in the footwhen the horse is in the stall. The orthotics willprovide arch support and help unload the perimeterwall to strengthen the arch and improve the heelstructure. Fig. 17 shows a racehorse foot after 5months of shoeing with a rolled toe/rockered heelshoe and frog support. The club foot is recognized as having strong heel structures and plenty of heel mass; however, thisfoot type can also be affected with chronic heel pain.Since the club foot overloads the toe and bone col-umn, arthritis, sidebone, pedal osteitis of the apex ofthe P-3, osteoarthritis, andcontracted heels are pathologies seen.The compressive forces on the navicular bone areincreased as the DDFT is pulled taut against theflexor surface of the navicular bone. Club feet oftenhave increased wall growth in the heels and slowwall growth at the toe. This is the foot's attempt toraise the heels and unload or accommodate the con-tracted DDFT. The foot remodels to accommodate all phases of the stride. Since the DDFT is under the most tension just before heel lift off (breakover), it is this phase of the stride, which must beaddressed when re-balancing the club foot. Sig-nicantly enhancing/easing break over can allowthese feet to return to a normal appearance.Figure 18 shows the same club foot after severalshoeings to accommodate the contracted DDFT. Most club feet can achieve equal toe/heel growth and resolve the anterior dish with these simple me-chanics. It is important to realize that the contrac-ture is not being \"xed\" or resolved, it is merely Fig. 15. A foot trimmed in 3 different planes to establish an ideal heel position without compromising the sole depth/protec-tion beneath the wings of the distal phalanx and to increase thepalmar angle of the cofn bone.

High-speed video and gait analysis studiesare needed to better understand how these clubfeet respond to this shoeing; however, anecdotal re-ports and observations reveal these horses seem tolengthen the stride and load the heels more. It ishypothesized that these don't have to take a \"shortstep\" to accommodate the tendon in the caudalphase of the stride since the break over is eased theylengthen the caudal phase and thus take longerstrides. The other possibility is that they are justmore comfortable in this style shoe and change theirgait for the better. When presented with a lower-limb lameness that may be secondary to the tendoncontracture, it is logical to rst address the tendoncontracture and secondary club foot/hoof capsuledistortion. The club foot is rebalanced by trimmingthe heels down and moving the breakover point backbeneath the anterior coronary band. This makesthe foot behave or function more like a normal footand oftentimes the secondary lameness resolves orgreatly improves. As these feet load the heels, theheel contracture tends to improve with time and use;however, in cases with atrophied frogs and robustbars, the heel is encouraged to spread by thinningout the bars, \"unhooking\" the point of the heels (oropening up the collateral sulci in the region of the heel buttress with the rasp), and loading the frog, sulci, andbars with elastic impression material. These feet of-ten benet from building the material up slightlyabove the ground surface of the shoe. Almost creat-ing a \"bumper\" or articial frog. This technique helpsengage the foot's shock-absorbing structures. Contracted heels can occur as a result of a chronic heel pain condition in which the heels have not beenloaded normally. Heel contracture can also be seenin club feet from mechanical under-loading of theheel region. Contracted heels should be differenti-ated from collapsed heels; some heel-collapse casescan also look contracted. Collapsed and under-runheels occur from overloading and bending of thehorn tubules, whereas heel contracture results fromunder loading, the horn tubules are usually straight and strong and aren't bent or folding over. Heel con-tracture can become a secondary source of lameness,worsening the lameness grade, and contributing to thecycle of abnormal landing, foot dysfunction, and lame-ness. Most heel contractures and collapse improve asthe foot is rebalanced and supported. There are many types of materials and styles of shoes to choose from. The ground surface and thediscipline of the horse dictate what type of shoe is mostappropriate. For example, too much or too little trac- Fig. 17.

Shoes should be t appropriately to provideadequate support and protection, without creating un-necessary leverage and torque. The COR of the DIPjoint should line up to the center of the weight-bearingsurface of the shoe. Depending on the degree of pa-thology, other shoe modications are helpful such asease of break-over, shock absorbing pads (Fig. 19), andarch support. Cases of DIP joint pain typically do notrespond well to heel elevation. Studies show thatelevating the heels increases pressure in the DIPjoint. 14Roller-motion shoes and a flat pad with soft arch support have the most positive effect on thesecases (Fig. 20). Roller motion shoes have a rolled heeland rolled toe. The mechanics of this shoe is believedto decrease the \"jarring\" at initial ground contact, anddecrease resistance to rollover or breakover, therebydecreasing the moment arm about the DIP joint, anddecreasing stress on the joint and peri-articularstructures. Synthetic shoes are available, which allow for more flexibility in the shoe compared to metal shoes. When appropriately applied, these shoes may mimicthe barefoot condition more closely while also allowingfor protection. If a case needs support for faulty con-formation or for a damaged ligament for example, thena metal shoe is probably the best choice as most syn-thetic shoes are designed to move and flex, and lack the structural rigidity required for support. There aremany shoes, sole support materials, and pads available;every case has very specic needs. Evaluating the entirehorse, its environment/footing, discipline, pathology, andconformation are necessary to recommend the most ap-propriate shoeing regime for each case.

Introduction The horn capsule is an amazing protective feature forming the interface between the horse and theground, enclosing and protecting multiple vital mus-culoskeletal structures. On the downside, this in-hibits veterinarians from directly visualizing andeasily accessing those structures for the assessmentof problems. Foot problems that can be directly visualized in- clude disorders affecting the horn capsule itself, such as wounds, horn cracks, bruising, and kerato-mas. Laminitis secondary to systematic diseasecan also be visualized, resulting in the typical lami-nitic stance in acute disease or indicative horn cap-sule changes in chronic disease. Certain features(e.g., low underrun/collapsed heels) may predisposehorses to certain problems or may be an indicator ofan ongoing or historic process (e.g., foot asymmetrywith one contracted and one \"normal\" foot as anindicator of chronic lameness). Anecdotally, many vets believe that certain move- ment characteristics are indicative of foot lameness,for example reluctance to turn or a shortened cranialphase of the stride (would specify the gait or gaits)on the straight, resulting in a \"pottery\" gait in bilat-erally foot lame horses. There is currently no sci-entic evidence for a characteristic foot lamenesspattern of movement as far as the author is aware.These beliefs may simply reflect the fact that thelikelihood that the lameness comes from the foot is higher than from it coming from other anatomicalareas. Most orthopedic problems in horses are degener- ative in nature, constituting the result of \"wear andtear\" through repetitive minor overloading. Thefoot is the most common site of front limb lamenessin the horse, 1and the most common structures af- fected are the deep digital flexor tendon, the navic-ular bone and its associated ligaments and bursa,and the cofn joint and its collateral ligaments. 2,3 All of these structures are inaccessible to direct vi-sualization or palpation and hence require addi-tional investigative methods. What Can Be Palpated? Direct palpation of foot-related soft tissue structuresis limited to structures proximal to the horn capsule.Veterinarians can assess the dorsal pouch of thecofn joint for effusion; palpate the origin of thecollateral ligament of the cofn joint, the heel, andpastern area for pain; and can get an impression ofsinking by palpating the rim of the horn capsule.Hands can be used to assess the temperature of thedorsal hoof wall in suspected laminitis cases, bear-ing in mind that this cannot be appreciated in alllaminitis cases for a variety of reasons and thatsome people have more sensitive hands than others. Indirect palpation by using hoof testers is a valu- able tool to locate pain points and is arguably the AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 413HOW TO MANAGE HOOF LAMENESS II NOTESmost useful in hunting for abscesses. Horses with pain originating from the navicular region show avariable response, making it a less reliable tool.Practitioners often rely on comparing the with-drawal response between left and right legs, and theuser ought to be conscious of the fact that the pres-sure the user applies varies between sides depend-ing on the handedness and experience of the user. 4 What Can Be \"Blocked\"? The author's \"go to method\" in localizing the site ofpain in horses is diagnostic analgesia. Nerve andjoint blocks intend to selectively anesthetize ana-tomical structures or areas. Unfortunately, overthe last few years, it has become apparent that these\"blocks\" are less specic than previously thought.The palmar digital nerve block has traditionallybeen used to selectively anesthetize the palmar partof the foot. However, studies have shown that thisblock can numb the whole foot and extend consider-ably proximally. Other diagnostic analgesia in thefoot include the cofn joint block and the navicularbursa block. Both are more specic than the pal-mar digital nerve block but can also result in anes-thesia of surrounding structures. 5,6 What Can Be Imaged? Radiography of the foot has been a standard compo-nent of assessing suspected foot lameness for de-cades. Indeed, the rst radiograph ever taken inanimals was that of a horse's foot. 7,8Due to the complex anatomy of the foot and the 2D nature ofradiographs, multiple projections are standard.These include lateromedial, and a palmaroproximal-palmarodistal (skyline, flexor) view. They areamended by additional views as required by theindividual case (e.g., oblique projections to assessthe wings of the pedal bone if a fracture is suspectedon the basis of history, clinical sign, and hoof testerndings). The integrity of sheath) can be assessed in thecase of wounds or penetrating injuries by injectingpositive contrast medium into the structure in ques-tion and imaging it afterward. The limitations of radiography, namely its inher- ent lack of sensitivity, should be considered. A 30-50% change in bone density is required before itbecomes radiographically apparent, which is onlyachieved in a more chronic state of disease. Itshould also be considered that once morphologicalchanges become radiographically apparent, they arewell established and often remain unchanged foryears (a prime example would be osteophytes as aradiographic sign of osteoarthritis). Thus, radio-graphs serve as a \"historic record\" of a diseaserather than evidence of an acute process; hence,there is often little correlation between radiographicand clinical ndings. Exceptions to this rule arefractures and also some lytic processes, such asflexor surface lesion of the navicular bone, which can be considered pathognomonic. In addition to its lack of sensitivity, and to a certain degree of specicity, radiography's biggestdisadvantage is that it does not allow visualizationof soft-tissue structures. With most foot-relatedpain originating from soft tissue, 3it seriously limits diagnostic ability when it comes to foot lameness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging method of choice for the evaluation of soft-tissuestructures, and it is also the only imaging methodthat allows the visualization of bone edema. Theadvancement of MRI, in general, and standing MRI,in particular, has simply revolutionized the diagnos-tic ability in relation to foot lameness. Prior toMRI, practitioners already knew from the clinicalpicture that a variety of problems existed in horses suffering from heel pain due to the differences in thedegree of pain, response to treatment, and prognosisbetween horses. MRI can now differentiate exactlywhich structure(s) are involved and how severe theproblem is. This is crucial as both lesion type andseverity affect prognosis and determine choice oftreatment. For example, a lesion in the deep digi-tal flexor tendon requires a completely different ap-proach compared to a lesion in the collateralligaments of the cofn joint. Having said that, inthe author's opinion, diagnostic abilities are farahead of treatment options and additional workneeds to be done to develop more differentiatedtreatment strategies (podiatric as well as medical) totarget specic lesions. 2. Conclusion In conclusion, the foot remains a diagnostic andcertainly a therapeutic challenge despite the hugeadvancements made with the development andmore widespread use of MRI. The diagnosis of footlameness requires a multimodal and extremely sys-tematic approach combining a thorough clinicalexam with careful application and interpretation ofdiagnostic analgesia with radiographs and MRI. As most horses presenting to the vet with lame- ness never go back to the previous level of perfor-mance, 3the author would like to suggest that the ways forward are preventative measures. Biome-chanically, the horse is a very \"ne-tuned machine\"and especially its musculoskeletal system operateswithin a very narrow safety margin. To minimizethe effect of wear and tear and slow down degener-ation of tissue, load should be reduced by keepingthe horse lean and optimizing load distributionthrough trimming and shoeing.

Introduction Equine podiatry issues are a common occurrence in equine practice and present a challenge to the ma-jority of veterinarians who are understandably inex- perienced with general maintenance requirements,trimming, forging, and shoeing. Therefore, they must depend on the experienced hands of a farrier.The farrier trade is a learned art that requires yearsof hands-on experience with multiple breeds anddisciplines to reach a competent level of service.Farriers are expected to have developed an eye forexternal alterations and the knowledge and skillsrequired to help maintain soundness despite theill effects of gate issues, developmental deformities,and hoof distortion relative to excessive or lack ofgrowth and pathological related problems. Withthese credentials farriers can become the eyes andhands that help determine the most appropriatemechanical treatment application. However, work-ing knowledge using radiographs as blueprints forplanning treatment strategy is essential for consis-tent pursuit of success. This is where both highlyrespected professionals step out of their comfortzone and into the eld of podiatry. Podiatry-focused radiographs are the common thread thatoffer the team members a means to detect mechan- ical decits relative to the diagnosis, consider op-tions that would best meet the mechanicalrequirements, and guide the hands responsible forthe strategic details. 1-3This common thread re- quires interpretive skills that carry the radiographicclues from the brain to the hands, the hands to therasp, and nal application. \"There is a ne line that runs from the eye to the brain and some things just do not make it across.\"\u2014Kevin Ashton from the book, \" How To Fly A Horse\" How true and no one escapes this proverbial learning curve. The rationale of this how-to session are the prob- lematic issues that face the veterinary/farrier teamas they develop and employ the treatment strategyusing radiographs as blueprints for pathological footissues. The objective is to describe a method thatoffers the operator a means of designing the mostappropriate pathological aid using the lateral/me-dial (LM) and dorsal/palmar or plantar (DP) im-ages as a blueprint and a means of bringing thespecic goals to fruition. Converting the specictrim lines of the chosen mechanical plan to the 416 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO MANAGE HOOF LAMENESS II NOTEShoof capsule is a critical step in the treatment plan. 2. Designing the Step-by-Step Plan Designing the strategy and the specic shoe require-ments requires a sound mechanical plan and this iswhere the learning curve gets steep. Current low-beam LM and DP images reveal the informationthat sets the stage for the mechanical thought pro-cess. Digital radiography offers immediate infor-mation and the ability to make measurements atthat moment. This seemingly minute detail en-hances the collaborative team efforts between theveterinarian and the farrier, as both professionalsare present and involved in the planning process.The team should study the radiograph and correlateas many parameter ndings to the external charac-teristics of the hoof as possible. A notepad andpencil offer a means to learn to feel the forces at playby sketching or tracing the lateral image along withthe balance of opposing forces (Fig. 1). The deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) and lami- nae are the two basic suspension components of thecofn bone and digits and in the healthy foot theyshare equal force on their respective side of thecofn bone. 2The support components (sole, frog, digital cushion, and associated horn wall and bars)lie distal to and complement the suspension. Whenload is transferred through the digits, it appearsthat it must rst engage the suspension and thencompress the support components maxing out thenatural limitations of the remarkably plastic com-ponents during peak load. When harmony existsbetween the suspension and support components,the foot is believed to be \"balanced\" as it has theability of full recall following peak load. Hoof capsuledistortions appear when this harmony is lost; thefoot is \"out of balance\", and the certain componentsof the foot no longer have full recall. Appropriate DDFT tension is important for nor- mal digital structure and function. 4However, if the hoof capsule is weakened by genetics, overload,injury, disease, en vironmental factors, or human interferences, the pull of the DDFT is believed to cause or exacerbate distortion of the hoof capsule.The authors share a reliable tendon theory that hasevolved from years of exclusive podiatry practiceand awareness of tissue response and the medicalbenets that are consistently gained by remarkablyreducing DDFT tension that opposes compromisedcomponents. The application of shifting load away from load-induced vascular compromised tissue tomore healthy zones brings meaning to the phrase,\"applying more mechanics.\" Understanding the forces at play that underlie the mechanical failure allows for a more precise strate-gic plan to be formulated. Recognizing the subtleor not-so-subtle changes in hoof conformation andunderstanding what changed internally enables theteam to begin to realize how to alter the internalforces in an effort to treat the ill effects of capsuledistortion. Designing the strategy and the specicshoe requirements requires a sound mechanicalplan and this is where the learning curve gets steep. Fig. 1. A, Sagittal cut of a low-grade club foot reveals the evidence of slightly increased DDFT tension producing an increased ground PA, healthy digital cushion but a relatively shallow sole depth. Note the linear arrangement of the pastern and dorsal hoof wall.B, Sagittal cut of prole contralateral front foot reveals DDFT laxity, which produces a negative ground palmar angle,weak digital cushion but adequate sole depth. Note the pastern sits well behind the dorsal face of the wall but it would be morevertical in the live horse increasing load on the sagging tendon and compressed digital cushion. Fig. 2.

This exercise helps train the eye tocorrelate landmarks with internal anatomy. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 TO MANAGE HOOF LAMENESS IIThe blueprint can be sketched on a piece of paper or made right on the radiograph using the measuringsoftware available on most units. Alternatively, apicture of the radiograph can be taken on a Smart-phone or tablet and manipulated as needed. Eitherway, reference points should be clearly marked sothat everyone on the team understands the mechan-ical goals of the trim, fabrication, and application ofthe mechanical aid. The eye, brain to hand exer-cise programs the information and repetitive rein-forcement starts the development of an instinctiveeye for mechanics. Understanding the precise loca-tion of the bone before putting the rasp to the footcan only be known with radiographic data. Apply-ing radio-opaque paste to the sole and the wall out-lining the cofn bone helps train the eye (Fig. 2).The palmar angle (PA), whether positive or nega-tive, will be reflected in the growth ring patternprovided it has been a few weeks post trimming.As a rule, the PA is lowered proportionally to theamount of heel removed. Therefore, the fresh trimand existing pattern may not coincide. Strategy for Increasing Heel Mass Wide growth rings at the toe and narrow at the heelwill indicate the toe is growing much faster than theheel and most of these feet will have a negative PA(Fig. 3). In the authors' opinion, this is an exampleof a suspension decit or lack of DDFT tension. Support for this theory lies in the fact that mostlow-prole feet have an upright pastern, which sub- sequently decreased the distance between the originand insertion of the DDFT. Imagine the effect ofphysically lifting the PA via the DDFT. If this werepossible, the digits would be realigned and effectivelyreverse the crushing effect due to inadequate suspen-sion, accelerate stronger horn growth, and aid regen-eration of the excessively compressed digital cushion.However, a modality has yet to be developed that canincrease DDFT suspension capabilities. Three basic concepts are prevalent relative to treating the crushed heel. Option 1. Back the obvious long toe up as hard as possible to make the toe angle appear larger andthe heels appear stronger. The low-prole foot isoften referred to as a long toe underrun heel, but acloser exam reveals a very healthy toe and no heel.Therefore, it is counterproductive to sacrice the toein hopes of making the heel appear stronger. Need-less to say, this is purely cosmetic and can be frus-tratingly unproductive. Option 2. Increase the toe angle and improve the digital alignment with wedged pads and/orwedged shoes. Despite its obvious initial improve-ment in toe angle relative to the ground, digitalalignment, and temporary soundness, this is consid-ered a temporary x. Wedging reduces tension onan already weak DDFT suspension that results infurther heel crushing and frog sag. Farriers world-wide have learned this lesson the hard way. Option 3. Trim to a zero, or if possible, a posi- tive PA and remove the crushed, folded heel tubules.It is normally not possible to start off with a negativePA and trim to a positive PA from toe to heel. There-fore, the strategy must change. Using the lateral ra-diograph as the blueprint, the treatment strategy canbe planned and followed to meet these prescribedgoals. Determining how to raise the PA of front feetby lowering the heels would sound impossible were itnot for working knowledge of the influence the DDFTappears to have on the high/low syndrome (Fig. 4). Trim the crushed, folded heel tubules back to the widest point of the frog, starting well behind thewidest point of the foot, taking the horn off at anangle that exposes stronger tubules on end. This Fig. 3. The growth rings are wider at the toe than at the heel. The angle they form is similar to degree of negative pal-mar angle. Fig. 4. A, Difference in heel prole in the left vs right forelimb. The left forelimb has inadequate DDFT suspension producing crushed heels and a sagging frog.

It is erroneously re-ferred to as a prolapsed frog; however, it is the extreme nature of the folded, crushed heel tubulesthat gives it the prolapsed appearance. It shouldbe left intact as it offers a means to push the digitalcushion dorsally relieving the sagging effect. Totrim to a positive PA from behind the widest point ofthe foot forward in a flat or slightly rockered prole,the farrier should know precisely the sole depth andPA. When radiographs aren't available, the solecan be trimmed as low as possible (Fig. 5). Using the curved tip of the farrier's knife, the exfoliated sole just off the apex of the frog can betrimmed to live sole just inside the nonpigmentedwall or just in front of the apex of the frog. Eithertechnique can be a reliable means of understandinghow much sole can be removed to establish a posi-tive PA and flat plane from the tip of the wingsforward without fear of getting into the solar papil-lae. To help replace the frog and digital cushion,weld a bar into the shoe that offers direct, positivefrog pressure. The peak of the rocker should bedirectly distal to the center of articulation and de-signed to offer adequate positive PA. Sole mass isexpected to double when the peak of breakover isdirectly distal to the center of articulation. Whentted to the foot, the frog bar and only the toe quar-ters are in contact with the foot, the heels of the shoeshould sit 5 to 6 mm away from the heel tubulescreating an air gap. Two nails secure the shoe andattention should be given to the response of thehorse when the foot is loaded. If there is too muchpressure, the horse will usually pick the foot up.If it likes it, it will usually off-load the contralateralfoot. Slow m otion video can capture the ascend- ing frog and cushion and expansion of the heelbulbs. This helps realign the digits, relieves the excessive load on the heel tubules, and utilizes thetough strong frog to enhance heel mass. Soundssimilar to the effect one would obtain if it werepossible to physically lift the palmar aspect of thecofn bone by the DDFT, doesn't it? The high/lowsyndrome is not a problem with the farrier, but aproblem for the farrier. It is not curable but cer-tainly manageable. Strategy for Crushed, Negative Plantar Hindlimbs The foot that follows behind the steeper foot in frontwill invariably have a lower heel height and steepercoronary band than its opposite. The mechanicalthought process is similar to the crushed, negativepalmar forelimb with a few exceptions. The folded heel tubules are rasped back at an angle just behindthe wings of the cofn bone; however, the shoe isforged to follow the trim line. Additionally, a shoe ischosen with a narrow stock thickness so that the veryprominent frog can make contact with the ground andpush the digital cushion back up into the foot (Fig. 6).Full rockers behind are reserved for the extremelythin sole, negative PA rear feet. Thinking throughthe mechanical and specic requirements of thebreed and disciplines and using radiographs to planthe strategy this concept offers the operator a meansto eliminate the negative PA, aid heel and digitalcushion restoration all the while allowing the horseto remain in training and competition.

Based on this clinical feature, the rst author came up with a grading system that encompasses the differentdegrees of hoof capsule distortion seen in the high-prole or club foot. 4 Grade I: Hoof angle is 3\u00b0 to 5\u00b0 higher than the contralateral limb and the pastern is set forward. Grade II: Hoof angle is 5\u00b0 to 8\u00b0 higher than the contralateral limb with growth rings noticeablywider at the heels than the toe. The heels do nottouch the ground when trimmed to a normal length. Grade III: The dorsal hoof wall is dished and the growth rings at the heel are twice as wide as atthe toe. Grade IV: The dorsal hoof wall is heavily dished, and the angle is 80\u00b0 or more. The coronaryband is as high at the heels as it is at the toe.The sole is below the ground surface. A positive PA with diverging growth rings may vary relative to breed stereotype and pathologicalconditions. The PA and degree of growth ring di-vergence will increase relative to the degree ofcontinuous muscle tension of the DDFT and areindicative of too much suspension. Externally,the degree of growth ring divergence correspondsroughly to the PA at the end of a trimming or shoe-ing cycle. In addition to the increased PA, most ofthese feet will also have poor sole depth ( /H1102110 mm). This indicates that the increased DDFT tension ismechanically restricting toe and sole growth by in-hibiting full papillae function that can consistentlybe demonstrated with venography. When the lackof sole protection presents soundness issues, morebenecial options other than traditional flat shoeingconcepts should be considered. Mechanical optionsare focused on reducing DDFT tension subsequentlyfreeing up the inhibiting ill effects of under perfu-sion to solar and dorsal tubular growth centers. Several treatment options are advocated.Option 1. Regular farrier care focused on removing the excessive heel growth has been advocated by horsemen as well as professionals.Unfortunately, this has more immediate cosmeticappeal than benets. Removing excess heel with-out regard for the reason it steadily outgrows the toecan be counterproductive as it increases the veryforce that contributed to the heel to toe growthimbalance. Option 2. Inferior check desmotomy can be very effective with the grade II and III club feet,especially when performed prior to load-inducedbone damage. Optimum results are obtained whenthe largest possible surgical gap is obtained at thetime of surgery. Reducing the existing 10\u00b0 to 15\u00b0PA to zero using radiographic guidelines assures thelargest surgical gap offering optimum results. Pre-and post-shoeing radiographs are paramount for thefarrier to determine how to trim to a zero capsule PAwith maximum heel mass for the placement of aslightly extended toe shoe. Farriers are accus-tomed to trimming toe to heel when lowering theheel, but this will not result in a zero PA. Instead,farriers should be familiar with transferring thetrim lines from the lateral image to the foot as it isa totally different trim plane. To help visualize thistrim line on the foot, place a dot of radio-opaquepaste on the skin frog junction and another on theapex of the frog. Connecting these two dots on thelateral image should reveal this plane is parallel tothe palmar rim but slightly distal. The rasp shouldlie in the same identical plane as the heel is re-moved. This technique can have a steep learningcurve but using the image to plan the trim line andshoe placement helps flatten the curve. Checkingthe trim plane frequently with an LM image canhelp prevent over trimming and/or an inaccuratetrim plane before it's too late. The shoe will onlycontact the short, flat area of the heel and requires acomposite ato glue it onto the foot and maintain the zero capsule PA. Caution should be used as manytimes the toe will be worn very thin and may havehorn defects that should be protected with wax toprevent unwarranted abscesses. The authors pre-fer to apply the pathological shoe prior to surgery toprevent unwarranted trauma to the surgery sitewhen the foot is shod post-surgery. Derotating thePA to zero would greatly increase the tension on theDDFT and compression on the solar corium if al- Fig. 7. A, Thoroughbred yearling with grade 3 club.

To avoid unwarranted trauma, apply a custom trubber wedge with one of many cushion supportproducts. The wedge should establish a 20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0ground PA and be secured to the shoe with tape orcast. This offers remarkable DDFT tension releasewhen the surgeon and farrier are unable to simul-taneously coordinate the shoeing and surgery. Themechanical benets of the post-shoeing wedge alsofacilitates the mid-cannon standing approach whenelected and provides an easy PA let down that helpsprevent post-surgical pain. Option 3. Application of a rocker shoe. The rocker concept is an option when the checkdesmotomy is not an option for clients who are sell-ing prospective high-level sport and racehorsesas the surgical blemish and potential risk of associ-ated unsoundness issues can remarkably reducetheir value. Therefore, an efcient shoeing optionshould be elected that can help manage the exces-sive heel and lack of toe growth. It is obvious thatthe tension on the DDFT must be remarkably re-duced. The goal is to lower the heel length to a zerocapsule PA without lowering the ground PA, as thatwould immediately defeat the purpose of removingheel. The rationale behind these goals is to loadthe heel tubules at the peak of suspension (the ex-isting PA) in order to increase load on the heel andlimit heel papillae production as well as decrease thecompressive forces on the solar papillae in order toenhance sole production. The specic trim linesare transferred to the foot based on the specica-tions made from the LM image with these two goalsin mind. A variety of aluminum fabricated shoescan be rockered to t the zero capsule PA andslightly rockered toe. The shoe should have ade-quate depth of the branches and the peak of therocker placed directly underneath the center of ar-ticulation to allow the horse to stand comfortably.Post-shoeing radiographs conrm how well the planwas followed and can reveal glaring flaws that re-quire immediate rethinking and alterations (Fig. 7). When nails are used to attach the rocker shoe to the more mature foot, the pattern varies consider-ably from the flat shoe nail pattern. The nailsshould be placed in the center of the shoe instead offorward of the widest point of the foot because therocker design allows the shoe to move at the samespeed as the foot, which limits the stress betweenthe shoe and the hoof. Evidence of this benet isrevealed in the nail holes that do not show wearfrom reset to reset and in reduced wear on the foot Fig. 8. A, RF LM image. Note the large calcication within the navicular suspensory ligament. B, This very painful lesion (3/5 Obel grade) was treated with a rockered aluminum shoe that raised the ground PA from 3\u00b0 to 12\u00b0 and the tendon surface angle from40\u00b0 to 50\u00b0. Note the location of the lesion and foot mass 6 weeks later. Fig. 9. A, RF LM image shows a zero capsule PA and a 37\u00b0 tendon surface angle (TSA) before shoeing.

Remarkable sole and toe growth and reduced heel growth is to be expectedwith reasonable predictability. The long-term goalis maintaining an even growth ring pattern and 15to 20 mm of sole mass. Case Example 1 Aged trail horse presented with bilateral lameness that was thought to be due to laminitis. Radio-graphs and clinical exam indicated that the pathol- ogy identied within the navicular suspensory ap-paratus was the most probable cause of lameness(Fig. 8). Trigger showed a favorable response tomechanical-enhanced rockers within days and re-turned to trail riding soundness. Case Example 2 An 11-year-old barrel mare presented with an acute onset of a 3/5 right fore (RF) and 2/5 left fore (LF)lameness. Radiographs and clinical exam indi-cated that the bilateral, remarkable navicular le-sions were supportive evidence for the current lameness (Fig. 9). The mare was shod with rockersand showed a steady im provement over 6 weeks and returned to full training and competition fol- lowing a second reset.Laminitis A torrent of clinical evidence supports the tendon theory as a means to complement the treatment oflaminitis with mechanical applications designed to re-duce the imbalance between the DDFT and its failingantagonist, thereby reducing the ill effects of laminaeand solar corium compromise. Vascular compromisemay be the cause and/or secondarily the victim of thecompartmental syndrome and is yet to be determined.Venographic evidence between the loaded and un-loaded images consistently reveals the compromisingeffect of DDFT tension as it resists the anchoringforces of its direct antagonist in the healthy foot and iseven more clearly revealed in feet that have remark-able laminitic damage. The imbalance of the two op-posing forces is apparently analogous to a game of tugof war between the DDFT and laminae and the lami-nae suddenly loses strength. Employing efcientDDFT tension-reducing pathological aids in a timelyfashion can diminish the devastating ill effect of theimbalance in forces, ultimately producing remarkablemedical benets. The goal of pathological shoeing inthis case is effectively aiding perfusion to mechanicallydeprived strategic components as soon as possible withthe intent to slow or halt the destructive process.

B, Unloaded LM image reveals moderate improved patency to the dorsal sub-lamellar and palmar supply. C, Initial loaded DP image. Note the starkloss of contrast both medial and lateral and along the palmar rim. D, Remarkable improvement in perfusion on the unloaded DPimage. This evidence, coupled with the horn response following the tenotomy, strongly supports the tendon theory. Fig. 11.

It is apparent that the cumulativeeffect of the initial vascular insult and the additionalmechanical force that contributes to further compro-mise sets the stage for the cascading series of events that can steadily destroy the integrity of the stra-tegic components. Unfortunately, the lam initic horse is often presented days to weeks after the mostresponsive window has long passed. Even when penetration has occurred, the traditional recommendation for euthanasia demands further consid-erations as a well-planned strategic protocol can stilloffer a favorable outcome. However, it does not comeeasy or inexpensive. Dean Richardson said it best con-cerning the many obstacles that face catastrophic ortho-pedic injuries and his thoughts parallel the authors'concerning laminitis: \"There is little qu estion that the option, acceptance, and ease of euthanasiacombined with the expense and practical difcultyof treating 'laminitis' have thwarted more rapidadvances in the eld of podiatry.\" Case Example 1 Polly, a trail mare, was presented with bilateral chronic laminitis, abscess draining RF and protrudinggranulation along the dorsal face, presented 8 weekspost-onset grade 4 out of 5 lame. The degree of dis-placement did not allude to the lesion intensity thatwas revealed in the venograms (Figs. 10 and 11).The remarkable level of improved perfusion betweenthe loaded and unloaded images was valuable infor-mation that helped advise the client concerning theurgent need to perform a DDFT tenotomy combinedwith derotation shoeing and decompression of the sole/wall versus the more conservative mechanicaloption. Information obtained from venogram is beingutilized more often as veterinarians learn the tech-nique, indications for performing, and developing in-terpretive skills. They can be helpful when planningtreatment strategies. Fig. 12. Right forelimb. A, LM image with the application of a wedged cuff shoe showing a 25\u00b0 capsule PA and 38\u00b0 ground PA.

Note theparallel arrangement between the palmar rim and the foot side of the shoe. This is an important mechanical requirement. Apositive capsule PA at the time of surgery limits reperfusion to the solar plexus. Fig. 13. Left forelimb. A, Initial loaded LM image revealed marked perfusion decits at the coronary plexus, dorsal sub-lamellar and circumflex vessels. B, The coronary cap, circumflex and solar plexus revealed very little response in the unloaded view. C, Post-shoeingLM image reveals useful data.

The foot is returned to a 20\u00b0 device to prevent unwarranted DDFT tension prior to the tenotomy.D, A wall ablation was performed to relieve the impaired circulation. A custom t piece of half-inch, betadine-impregnated felt was placedin the hoof wall defect and wrapped tightly below the coronary band with 2-inch elasticon and changed daily until the laminae fully Example Broodmare in foal, rst trimester with bilateral lam ini- tis approximately 8 weeks post onset. There was drainage at the dorsal coronary bands bilaterally,but the mare was surprisingly quite sound (1 of 5).Both front feet were placed in 15\u00b0 cuffed wedgeshoes for the exam to minimize further damage tothe vulnerable apex and traumatized solar coriumwhile radiographs were performed and the planneddetermined. Baseline radiographs showed markedrotation with minimal bone damage. Venogramswere certainly not needed to know that tenotomieswere indicated but provided information that offeredencouragement for a reasonably good prognosis eventhough the ultimate prognosis was dependent on thequality and speed of vascular reperfusion to thelaminae and solar corium. The degree of lamenessis not a reliable damage indicator and even radio-graphs can offer strikingly different conclusionsthan venograms. Both feet were derotated usingradiographic control with the goal of setting thecapsule PA to zero and leaving 20 mm of heel mass.A 5\u00b0 wedge rail shoe with an extended heel is ap-plied to prevent toe lift and excessive luxation of thecofn joint when the tendon is cut. The mechan-ical requirements that are necessary to optimizethe post-surgery medical benets are paramountand demand the greatest respect and interest(Figs. 11-16). This ongoing case was showing afavorable response at the time of this report due tothe intense collaborative efforts of Harvey Sch-neiter DVM; his farrier, Craig Wilson; and therst author. These cases point out the potency of mechanics when used to temporally eliminate the function of theDDFT and the contributing ill effects of it opposing thedysfunctional laminae anchor. The medical benetsthat can be obtained are the summation of the tenot-omy, wall ablation and ongoing strategic follow up. 4. Conclusion Planning the strategy for pathological shoeing basedon radiographic data and the mechanical require-ments necessary to enhance the healing environmentwas found to be very useful in treating career- andlife-threatening foot issues. The learning curve forthe mechanical thought process based on the tendontheory is steep for both farriers and veterinarians.It is quite clear that all parties need good experience;must understand the subject matter, their roles, andthe gravity of their responsibilities, as well as be ableto allocate sufcient time and effort to see the task tofruition. Podiatry issues can often be frustratingwhen team members are not experienced with theintensity of gathering adequate information requiredto develop a realistic treatment strategy and utilizing Fig. 14.

Introduction Vaccines from different manufacturers are often used interchangeably despite differences in strains,adjuvants, and antigen masses. There are no stud-ies that show if this practice leads to an adequateantibody response in horses. The objective of thisstudy was to use the hemagglutination inhibition(HI) assay to investigate the humoral immune virus (EIV) vaccinefrom different manufacturers' administered to pre-viously immunized healthy adult horses. 2. Materials and Methods This was a prospective study using 64 healthy, adulthorses historically vaccinated with the same EIVcommercial product over the years. Experimentalsubjects were divided into 3 groups of 20 horses(groups 1, 2, and 3) and vaccinated with 3 differentcommercially available vaccines. Each group wasfurther subdivided into subjects that received onedose of the respective vaccine and those that re-ceived a second dose 30 days later. A fourth groupof 4 horses served as environmental sentinels.Serum was collected at different time points from allsubjects over 180 days in order to assess antibodyresponses to contemporary EIV Florida sublineageclade 1 and 2 strains by HI assay. The KruskalWallis test was used to determine signicant differ-ences in antibody responses among groups. Statis-tical signicance was set at P/H110210.05. 3. Results For all three vaccine groups, there was a signicantdifference between antibody titers measured pre-and postadministration of the rst dose of vaccine.In contrast, there was no signicant difference be-tween day 30 titers and titers at subsequent time-points, even in those horses that received a seconddose of vaccine on day 30.

Introduction Bacterial infections are common in adult horses and foals and are associated with substantial morbidityand sis(C. pseudotuberculosis), are among the most prev- alent and important bacterial pathogens, causing disease in the respiratory tract and other body sys-tems. 1Potentiated sulfonamides (trimethoprim/sul- fonamide combinations) are frequently included intreatment protocols for infections with these and otherbacteria because a broad spectrum of pathogens aresusceptible to these drugs. 2Additionally, potentiated sulfonamides are well absorbed following oral admin-istration to both adult horses and foals.3-7Of the potentiated sulfonamides, only trimethoprim/sulfadia- zine (TMP-SDZ) formulations are currently FDA ap-proved for use in horses; the label indication beingtreatment of lower respiratory tract infections causedbyS. zooepidemicus. For many years, TMP-SDZ for- mulations for oral use were not available in the UnitedStates; therefore, practitioners instead used thehuman-label trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) formulations in an extra-label manner, in com-pliance with the provisions of the Animal MedicinalDrug Use Clarication Act (AMDUCA). 8Now that several FDA-approved TMP-SDZ products are avail-able, there is minimal justication for use of the hu-man-label TMP-SMZ formulation because such use israrely justied under the provisions of AMDUCA. 432 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSMEDICINE: INFECTIOUS DISEASES NOTESThese include the provision that there is no approved new animal drug that is labeled for such use and thatcontains the same active ingredient, which is in therequired dosage form and concentration, except wherea veterinarian nds, within the context of a validveterinarian-client-patient relationship, that the ap-proved new animal drug is clinically ineffective for itsintended use. 8Two important determinants of clini - cal efcacy antibiotics pharmacokinetics, includ-ing bioavailability following administration by routesother than intravenous, and susceptibility of com-monly encountered bacteria to the antimicrobial drugor combination in question. 1,9Several studies have shown that TMP-SDZ is well absorbed after oral ad-ministration to horses and has a pharmacokinetic pro-le that is consistent with efcacy following oraldosing at 12-hour intervals. 4-7,10To date, there is a paucity of data regarding the comparative in vitro susceptibility of S.zooepidemicus and other equine- origin bacterial pathogens to TMP-SDZ and TMP-SMZ. The objective of this study was therefore togenerate such data for S.zooepidemicus and other common equine pathogens. 2. Methods Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was biovar 2 (n /H110055). These bacteria had been collected between 1986 and 2016 from adulthorses and foals with clinical disease, and had beenstored as frozen stabilates at /H1100280\u00b0C in skim milk or on glass beads. aThe identity of each bacterial isolate was conrmed based on colony morphology,Gram-staining characteristics, biochemical charac-teristics, and results of genetic testing laser desorption ionization-time offlight mass spectrometry system. Susceptibilitytesting was performed using the broth microdilution procedure b, following Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute protocols.11Briefly, one bacterial colony was inoculated into brain heart infusion broth and incubated for 4 hours at 35\u00b0C. A small amount ofthis inoculated broth was then added to 0.85% NaClsolution to achieve a 0.5 McFarland Standard con-centration, as measured using a nephelometer.Ten microliters of this suspension were added toMueller Hinton broth, and plates bwere inoculated with 100 /H9262L of the Mueller Hinton broth in each well. The following bacterial strains were runweekly as controls in accordance with the standardquality control procedures in place at the VeterinaryMedical Teaching Hospital Microbiology Laboratory(MDL): Staphylococcus aureus custom made MDL by the manufacturer. The range of TMP-SDZor TMP-SMZ concentrations tested was 0.12/2.4 /H9262g/mL to antimicrobial combi- nation. The minimum inhibitory concentration(MIC) was recorded as the lowest concentration ofantimicrobial drug combination (TMP-SDZ or TMP-SMZ) that inhibited visible growth of bacteria.An isolate was considered to be susceptible to TMP-SDZ or TMP-SMZ if its MIC value was /H113492/38 /H9262g/ mL, as recommended by the Clinical LaboratoryStandards Institute. 11The respective concentra- tions at which 50% (MIC50) and 90% (MIC90) ofisolates of a particular bacterial species were sus-ceptible to TMP-SDZ and TMP-SMZ, were also de-termined. In order to create numerical data thatcould be analyzed, only the concentration of TMP inthe xed ratio combination was used. Concentra-tions that were at or below the lower limit of quan-titation of the MIC test (i.e., /H113490.12 /H9262g/mL) were ascribed a value of 0.12 /H9262g/mL to facilitate statisti- cal analysis using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test forpaired data. A P-value of /H11349.05 was used to ascribe statistical signicance to differences between groups(TMP-SDZ vs TMP-SMZ). 3. Results Overall Findings The MIC values for both TMP-SDZ and TMP-SMZ against isolates of S. zooepidemicus, S. equi, C. pseu- dotuberculosis, and A. equuli are shown in Table 1. Of the 479 isolates tested, only 1 (0.21%), a S. zooepi- demicus isolate, was resistant to TMP-SDZ. The same isolate was also resistant to TMP-SMZ. S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus Of the 282 S. zooepidemicus isolates tested, 281 (99.6%) were susceptible to both TMP-SDZ andTMP-SMZ (MIC /H113492.0/38 /H9262g/mL), whereas 1 (0.4%) isolate was resistant to both drug combinations(MIC /H110058/152 /H9262g/mL). With the exception of the resistant isolate, all S. zooepidemicus isolates were highly susceptible, with MIC values ranging be-tween /H113490.12/2.4 /H9262g/mL and 1/19 /H9262g/mL for both TMP-SDZ and (Table 1). One hundredthirty-four of the 282 S. zooepidemicus isolates (47.5%) had an MIC value that was the same forboth TMP-SDZ and TMP-SMZ, whereas 148 isolates(52.5%) had an MIC value for TMP-SDZ that wasone concentration higher than for TMP-SMZ. Inother words, 52.5% of isolates were one dilution lesssusceptible to TMP-SDZ than to TMP-SMZ. Statis-tical analysis showed this difference to be highlysignicant (P /H11021.0001). The MIC 50values was 0.25/4.75 /H9262g/mL. S. equi subsp. equi Of the isolates, all (100%) were highly sus- ceptible to both drug combinations (MIC range of AAEP 66 isolates had an MIC of /H113490.12/2.4 /H9262g/mL, 33 had an MIC of 0.25/4.75 /H9262g/mL, and 1 had an MIC of 0.5/9.5 /H9262g/mL (Table 1). For TMP-SMZ, 50 isolates had an MIC of /H113490.12/2.4 /H9262g/mL and 5 had an MIC of 0.25/4.75 /H9262g/mL. Twenty-three (42%) of the 55 S. equi isolates had the same MIC for both TMP-SDZ and TMP-SMZ, 33 (60%) had an MIC for TMP-SDZ that was oneconcentration higher than for TMP-SMZ and 1 (1.8%)had an MIC value for TMP-SMZ that was 1 concen-tration lower than for TMP-SMZ. Statistical analysisshowed MIC values for TMP-SMZ to be signicantlylower than those for TMP-SDZ (P MIC were highly susceptible both TMP-SDZ TMP-SMZ; MIC values ranged from/H113490.12/2.4 /H9262g/mL to 0.5/9.5 /H9262g/mL for both drug com- binations (Table 1). MIC values for TMP-SDZ wereidentical to those of TMP-SMZ. Forty-four of the47 isolates (93.6%) had MIC values of /H113490.12/2.4 /H9262g/mL for both drug combinations, 2 isolates (4.3%) had MIC values of 0.25/4.75 /H9262g/mL and 1 isolate (2.1%) had an MIC value. of 0.5/9.5 /H9262g/mL. No signicant differences were observed in MIC valuesbetween TMP-SDZ and TMP-SMZ. C. pseudotuberculosis All isolates of C. were highly sus- ceptible to both TMP-SDZ and TMP-SMZ and the twodrug combinations showed equal antimicrobial activ-ity (Table 1). The MIC value for 95 of 96 isolates was/H113490.12/2.4 /H9262g/mL for both TMP-SDZ and TMP-SMZ. The remaining isolate had an MIC value of 0.25/4.75 /H9262g/mL for both drug combinations. The MIC50and and no signicant differenceswere observed between them. 4. Discussion The almost universal susceptibility of the commonlyencountered equine bacterial pathogens tested inthis study to the potentiated sulfonamide antimicro-bials attests to their potential utility for treating arange of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterialinfections in sulfon-amide antimicrobials, only the TMP-SDZ combina-tion is licensed for use in horses; the label indicationbeing treatment of respiratory infection caused byS. zooepidemicus . In addition to the favorable pharmacokinetic prole of TMP-SDZ after oral ad-ministration to both adult horses and foals, the labelindication is supported by the ndings of this anti-microbial susceptibility study. Two hundredeighty-one of 282 (99.6%) S. zooepidemicus isolates were found to be susceptible to TMP-SDZ (MIC/H113492/38 /H9262g/mL). Of these, 276 (97.2%) were suscep- tible at concentrations /H113490.25/4.75 /H9262g/mL. Al- though statistical analysis using the Wilcoxonsigned-rank test showed that MICs for TMP-SMZwere signicantly lower than those for TMP-SDZagainst S. zooepidemicus and S. equi, this difference was typically one dilution and is unlikely to be ofclinical signicance because the MIC was approxi-mately 10-fold lower than the cut-off for susceptibil-ity (2/38 /H9262g/mL). Additionally, those isolates that had MIC values greater than 0.25/4.75 /H9262g/mL for TMP-SDZ also had higher MIC values for TMP-SMZ. Furthermore, Diagnostic Laboratories rarelyinclude concentrations lower than 0.5/9 /H9262g/mL in quantitative (MIC) susceptibility tests on clinicalisolates or use the non-quantitative Kirby-Bauertest. Under these circumstances, reported suscep-tibility proles for TMP-SDZ and TMP-SMZ wouldtypically be identical. The above results do not support the extra-label use of TMP-SMZ in preference to approved formu-lations of TMP-SDZ; in fact, such use of TMP-SMZcould be interpreted as violating the provisions ofthe AMDUCA and should be discouraged.

Introduction Current diagnostic testing for strangles requires conrmation of S. equi detection via conventional bacterial culture and/or polymerase chain reaction(PCR). The latter analytical platform is consideredto be the gold standard for detection of the strepto-coccal organisms. The study aimed at validating apoint-of-care (POC) PCR assay for the ros- tral nasal swabs from horses with suspected acutestrangles and to compare the results against themolecular gold standard of quantitative polymerasechain reaction (qPCR). 2. Materials and Methods Two hundred thirty-two individual swabs collectedfrom the rostral nasal passages were positive, equi subspecies zooepidemicus (S. zooepidemicus) positive, and S. equi and S. zooepidemicus negative by qPCR. The samples were analyzed using the POC PCR accord-ing to the manufacturer's recommendations. Fur-ther, limit of detection was determined using 10-folddilutions of a plasmid containing the S. equi target sequence (eqbE gene). 3. Results and Discussion The overall agreement between the two PCR plat-forms was 85.8%. The specicity was qPCR and thePOC PCR analyzer was 3 and 277 eqbE target genes ofS. equi, respectively.

Hay, DVM Author's address: Teigland, Franklin, & Brokken, 12277 Lauderdale, e-mail: hay@tfbequine.com. \u00a9 2020 AAEP. 1. Introduction Endoscopy of the upper airway is an integral part of the examination of racing and prospective racing horses. Since the development of flexible endo- scopes, the procedure has become more and morecommonplace. Although video endoscopy has beenavailable for decades, portability to make video en-doscopy a simple stall-side procedure has only beendeveloped in recent years. This portability makesproduction of a large number of video-endoscopystudies in a short time frame a much more feasibleprocedure. 2. Why During public auction, often, large numbers of buy-ers are interested in individual horses for purchase.Many of these buyers will have enough interest inan individual horse that they will engage their vet-erinarian to examine the animal via upper airwayendoscopy. It is not uncommon for popular horsesto have multiple exams of more than 10 veterinari-ans performing endoscopic examinations in a singleday. As a m atter of fact, at some very popular sales, it becomes commonplace. There are concerns that multiple upper airway examinations on a particular horse could lead toinjury or inflammation that may either harm thehorse or lead to changes in its airway appearance over a short time frame. Other concerns are basedon the thought that many endoscopic proceduresunder restraint on individual horses representsome level of unnecessary discomfort to the animal. More than 20 years ago, it was recognized that multiple examinations of horses with radiographyduring the presale period was cumbersome and dif- cult to complete for both the veterinarian and thesales consignor. To address this issue, sales repos-itories were created to house presale radiographstaken by the consignor's veterinarian during thedays leading up to the sale. Although endoscopy of horses is less of a time commitment to the veterinarian, having video-endoscopy studies also placed in the sales repositoryhas advantages. It may reduce the number of ex-ams performed on an individual horse, thus decreas-ing the amount of stress and discomfort placed onthe animal. It will also allow the veterinarian thatis employed by a potential buyer to be more timeefcient in their workload when they must negotiatemultiple exams during a short time period. 3. Current Examples As of the 2019 US auction season, availability ofvideo-endoscopy studies that have been produced by 440 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSCURRENT CONCEPTS IN THE ENDOSCOPIC EVALUATION OF THE UPPER AIRWAY NOTESthe sales consignor's veterinarians has become more and more commonplace. Many of these have beenplaced in the sales repository for viewing yet, at thetime of this writing, there are very few protocolsestablished as far as requirements or m inimum standards for these videos. Also, the major US auc-tion companies have not currently altered their con-ditions of sale warranties on airways to reflect anyrelationship to the video-endoscopy exam provided. Other Thoroughbred sales throughout the world, such as those held in England, Ireland, France a, Australia, and New Zealandbhave seen varying ac- ceptance of the use of repository video-endoscopy exams. None of the auction companies in thesecountries have mandated that video-endoscopy stud-ies be provided for buyers to view. 4. American Association of Equine Practitioners Guidelines In 2016 a working group of the American Associa- tion of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) was establishedto develop standards and protocols for video endos-copy at sales due to continued interest and discus-sion by the industry stakeholders. This workinggroup produced the following: Protocol for Pre-Sale Video-endoscopic Examina- tion of the Upper Airway at Public Auction (2016) c Equipment must be capable of producing adigital video image of excellent quality. Horse must be identied appropriately, andthat identication must be in digital formatwith character generation on the screen,and/or video of the catalog page, followed byunbroken video of the face prior to introductionof the scope into the nares (right or left) and upto the larynx. This is a single-stream videowith no editing. The veterinarian performingthe video, or the con signor will submit each upper-airway video on an individual flashdrive or CD. Upper airway videos should bestored in a le separate from the radiographsin the repository in case of client request forone or the other. Standard technique must include maximumabduction of the arytenoids induced by swallow-ing (multiple times) and nasal occlusion. Theduration of the video must be sufcient to iden-tify all laryngeal and pharyngeal structures aswell as observing their maximal function withinthe context of a resting exam. The interval between the pre-sale video-endo-scopic exam and the selling session will notexceed 10 days. 5. Equipment As mentioned before, recent developments in video-endoscopy equipment has allowed more portabilityand thus ease of use to make production of qualityendoscopy studies more common. It is no longerrequired to transport large-tower video-endoscopyunits to the horse or to transport the horse to a facility with such equipment to create a good study.There are cu rrently several portable units on the market. These units vary from video camera-equipped beroptic endoscopes to digital scopes with video viewing attached or with Wi-Fi orBluetooth wireless connectivity. Several of theseunits have simple character generation capabilityand some even have the capability to read the sub-ject horse's identifying microchip and add that in-formation to the video produced. 6. Procedure Producing the video requires one to approach theprocedure in a standardized fashion so that eachvideo created is similar in basic format. Althoughit may be required from time to time, tranquilizationshould not be a standard procedure as it may affectfunction of the airway to some degree. Most horsestolerate the procedure well under traditional meth-ods of restraint and will not need tranquilization. As discussed in the AAEP-approved protocol above, the exam requires either character genera- tion that identies the horse embedded in the videoproduced and/or the visualization of the horse's cat-alog page and the horse's face in one continuousvideo stream as one introduces the scope into thenares. The author suggests doing both so that there is little question as to the identity of the horsebeing examined. It is important that when doing the exam, that one is conscious to not only visualize all importantpharyngeal and laryngeal structures but to also beaware that frequent movement of the scope withinthe upper airway can make the video hard to watch. Nearly all exams will be done visualizing only one nasal passage as it is somewhat rare in horses at asale to be concerned about issues with the structureswithin that part of the airway. Once in the phar-ynx, it is important to view the guttural pouch open-ings and the pharyngeal recess as well as directingdownward to visualize the larynx and soft palate.Fields of view among video endoscopes vary andalthough many scopes will have a large enough eldof view to see the entire pharynx/larynx withoutmoving, others will have to be repositioned to see allstructures. The examination of upper airways at sales is mostly concerned with laryngeal structure and func-tion, epiglottis structure and soft palate dynamics.These structures and functions must be viewed onthe video in sufcient fashion as to give the vieweran adequate idea that they would feel as comfortableviewing the video as they would if they performedthe examination themselves. This requires the vet-erinarian creating the video to take appropriatetime to adequately view all structures, make thehorse swallow multiple times and also to occlude thehorse's nares to make the horse take several deepbreaths to exhibit its maximal arytenoid movement. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 441CURRENT CONCEPTS IN THE ENDOSCOPIC EVALUATION OF THE UPPER AIRWAYIt is understood by most that even an excellent video may not be satisfactory to all that would view them due to multiple issues. Some veterinariansmay not be satised with the length of the exam ortimeliness of the procedure related to the actualtime of the sale. There also may be concerns bysome examining veterinarians that sales conditionsdo not adequately protect the buyer from a changingairway due to conditions of inflammation from thetime of the initial exam to the time of the actual saleof the horse. But a well-produced video that is rep-resentative of the horse at the time the exam isperformed will likely reduce the number of exami-nations needing to be performed on the individualsale horse. 7. Sales Conditions At the time of this writing, none of the major salescompanies in the US have addressed any con ditionsof sale that would be affected by the placement ofvideo-endoscopy studies that are placed in therepository.

Introduction Nasal discharge can represent something benign, life threatening, or anything in between. For thesereasons, the examiner should have an idea of whatcould be causing the discharge based on the historyand clinical signs so they are sure to look thoroughlyin the correct area during an endoscopic examina-tion. Most cases of nasal discharge will be un ilat- eral and the examiner can focus on one side.However, it is always important to evaluate both sides, preferably the \"normal side\" rst to see whatnormal is for this particular horse and to see if thereare any abnormalities that are not yet clinically evident. The source of any nasal discharge can usually be determined by a comprehensive upper airway endos-copy. Split the examination into the main compart-ments: guttural pouch, pharynx, sinus cavities, andnasal passage. Discharge emanating from the cau- dal aspect of the middle meatus is almost always theresult of fluid exiting the sinus cavity through thenasomaxillary opening and is indicative of either aprimary or secondary sinusitis. Infrequently, thedisease process drains into the nasal cavity furtherrostrally, and the origin of the discharge can only beseen if the endoscope is passed down the entiremiddle meatus. For this reason, the endoscopeshould be passed through the ventral meatus andnot just look at the caudal aspect of the nasal pas-sage. Unlike the nasomaxillary opening, any dis- charge at the opening of the guttural pouch can bedraining from the pouch or can be the result ofdischarge within the pharynx being pushed into theopening during swallowing and may not represent aguttural pouch problem. Therefore, evidence ofdischarge at the guttural pouch opening is not al-ways because of the material coming from the gut-tural pouch. Nasal discharge is typically not an emergency, but any horse with nasal hemorrhage more than atrickle should be evaluated immediately. Althoughbilateral epistaxis is most commonly from exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, is not a large vol-ume, and is not life threatening, a moderate tosevere bleed not associated with extreme exercisecan be secondary to guttural pouch mycosis, could befrom one or both nares, and could be life threaten-ing. If a large clot or volume of blood is evident onendoscopic examination at the guttural pouch open-ing, no further evidence is needed prior to referralfor surgery. Trying to endoscopically evaluate theinside of the guttural pouch close to the time of asevere bleed is usually futile because the amount ofblood within the pouch will obscure visualization and attempting this may only make matters worse. Other causes of epistaxis to consider are trauma, neoplasia, fungal infections, retropharyngeal ab- PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 443CURRENT CONCEPTS IN THE ENDOSCOPIC EVALUATION OF THE UPPER AIRWAY NOTESscess rupture into the guttural pouch, or ethmoid hematomas.1All of these conditions typically cause a much lower blood volume relative to guttural pouch mycosis. Blood emanating from the nasomaxillary opening can also be the result of traumatic bleedinginto the sinus without external evidence of trauma.Neoplasia or fungal infection that cause epistaxisis usually seen easily on endoscopic examination,and blood is often mixed with purulent discharge.These conditions may only show evidence of dis-charge at the nasomaxillary opening, from the re-gion of the ethmoid recess, or other locations alongthe nasal cavity. Fungal infections are most com-monly dorsal and rostral margins ofthe septum. Purulent discharge usually represents a response to bacterial infection of the guttural pouch or sinuscavities. 1Complete examination of the ventral and middle meatus is recommended because a separateopening into the nasal cavity may be infrequentlypresent or the material becomes so inspissated thatit becomes contained entirely within the m iddle me- atus. Primary bacterial infections of the sinuswithout an underlying cause are common. Culturefrom the nasal passage with a swab is not usuallyrewarding, but a promising technique has been de-scribed to culture directly from the nasomaxillaryopening and can provide some support for primaryvs. secondary sinusitis. 2 Uncommonly, sinusitis can also become severe enough to cause nasal obstruction and/or facial de-formity, but more commonly these distortions areassociated with a neoplastic or cystic mass. Eth-moid hematomas can also cause some nasal obstruc-tion but rarely cause facial deformity and will produce small-volume epistaxis, not purulent dis- charge. Cysts usually cause facial or nasal defor-mity and typically do not cause any nasal dischargeunless a secondary sinusitis occurs. Differentiat-ing the cause of the symptoms is important priorto any decisions about treatment because mostneoplastic diseases have a poor prognosis. Sig-nalment, history, and diagnostic imaging should provide enough information for the clinician todifferentiate the etiology of the disease. 2. Endoscopic Evaluation of the Sinus When there is a clear indication of sinus disease vianasal endoscopic evaluation, further imaging (com-puted tomography or radiographs) can provide moreinformation about the possible etiology. Yet, thereis still limited information from those diagnostictechniques, and endoscopic examination of the sinuscan provide more information and a possible method oftreatment. 3There are several descriptions of sino- scopic approaches. A frontal 22-mm trephinationis preferred. Familiarity with normal anatomy isessential. This app roach will allow access to the major sinus cavities and allow the treatment of many abnormalities with minimal surgical traumato normal structures. Although the approach pro-vides direct access to the frontal, dorsal conchal, andcaudal maxillary, breaking down the the ventral conchalsinus and rostral maxillary sinus. 3 Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of Veteri- nary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Introduction Epiglottic entrapment is often associated with younger racehorses and can be associated with ex-ercise intolerance, respiratory noise, and coughing,but can also be observed in non-racehorses and maybe intermittent initially. 1-4Acute or simple en- trapments consist of a thin portion of the subepiglot-tic membrane engulng the epiglottic cartilage andin itself is unlikely to cause respiratory obstruction, 5 but may precipitate dorsal displacement of the softpalate. 6Other commonly recognized features of an epiglottic thickeningand/or ulceration of the entrapping as deformation of epiglottic cartilage par- ticularly in chronic entrapments. The \"outline\" of the epiglottis underneath the entrapping membranecan provide some indication the degree of pathologyand the prognosis. 7 Many approaches have been described for surgical correction of epiglottic entrapment.7-15Axial divi- sion of the entrapping fold is a commonly utilizedtechnique and several methods to perform axial di-vision have been described. Axial division is usu-ally completed under endoscopic guidance and maybe performed completely via the endoscope using alaser through the endoscopic biopsy channel, or maybe performed using a bistoury knife passed along-side the endoscope (Fig. 1). Common approaches include transnasally or transorally and division maybe accomplished either with the horse standing us-ing sedation and local anesthetic or with the patientunder general anesthesia. The presence of a thick-ened or ulcerated entrapping membrane may neces-sitate alternative methods such as the resection oftissue through similar surgical approaches or througha laryngotomy (Fig. 2). In general, it appears thathorses that undergo resection to resolve the entrap-ment will not have as good a prognosis. 7,11For this reason efforts should be made to resect tissue onlywhen necessary. To perform a standing transendoscopic axial divi- sion, horses should be moderately sedated and thethroat blocked topically. If the horse is heavilysedated, they will not swallow at all during theprocedure. Having them infrequently swallow isadvantageous because it creates the normal tension on the membranes. With a laser setting of 18W, abare laser ber is dragged in contact fashion fromthe central caudal edge of the entrapping membranetoward the rostral tip of the epiglottis to cut theentrapping membrane. If the membrane over thedorsal surface of the epiglottis is not under sufcienttension such that each cut leads to a greater sepa-ration of tissues, the laser ber is used to perform AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 445CURRENT CONCEPTS IN THE ENDOSCOPIC EVALUATION OF THE UPPER AIRWAY NOTESsimilar cuts to the membrane on the ventral surface of the epiglottis. This often results in a resumptionof greater tension on the membranes over the dorsalsurface and the further cuts are dictated by areas ofgreatest tension until complete division of the mem-branes allowed visualization of the dorsal surface ofthe epiglottis and reduction of the membranes to aposition ventral to the epiglottis. Swallowing isstimulated to the membranes will not re-entrap over the epiglottis. Resection of any mem-brane is performed when tissue is judged to beexcessively thick or brous, such that the tissue willnot reduce into a position ventral to the epiglotticedge after initial axial division. If resection of thetissue is performed, a transesophageal grasping for-ceps ais passed up the contralateral nostril and assmall a margin of the membrane as possible isgrasped and resected until complete exposure of thedorsal and lateral margins of the epiglottis. Alternatively, a hook can be used to keep the membrane dorsal to the epiglottis off the epiglottisand under tension. The tissue just over the hookis transected. Postoperative recommendations arefor 3 weeks of stall rest and hand walking, prior tore-evaluation and likely return to training with sim-ple entrapments. Several more weeks of rest arerecommended for most horses that required resec-tion of any membrane. Follow-up endoscopic ex-aminations to particularly evaluate the ventral surface of the epiglottis are recommended for anyhorses that require resection of any membrane tobetter determine time to resume training.

Introduction In general, a tie-back surgery is indicated when the arytenoid cartilage collapses into the airway duringexercise causing airflow obstruction, which usuallyproduces upper airway (UA) noise and usually ad-versely affects performance. However, the need toperform a tie-back procedure depends on the use orintended use of the horse. It is well known that re-current laryngeal neuropathy (RLN) clinically thedistal axonopathy of the recurrent laryngeal nerve isnot known, but this causes atrophy of the cricoaryte-noideus dorsalis muscle, adversely affecting abductionof the arytenoid cartilage. Incomplete abduction ofthe right arytenoid cartilage is generally due to laryn-geal dysplasia, arytenoid chondritis, or right recurrentlaryngeal nerve trauma. These conditions can alsoaffect the left arytenoid cartilage, but are infrequentcauses of inadequate abduction compared to RLN. Horses that cannot fully abduct the arytenoid car- tilage during a resting exam do not all need a tie-back procedure. There are several factors thatneed to be considered when determining what rec-ommendations to make, with cost of the procedurebeing a consistent factor. Most of the other factorsare as follows: What is the history and/or presenting complaint? Is UA noise the primary problem? If so, this canoften be signicantly improved with a bilateral ven-triculocordectomy (VCE). It is important to recog-nize this procedure is not always effective. Isperformance the primary problem? In the race- horse, evaluation of the race record is helpful. If so,a tie-back procedure and usually a left VCE areindicated. Is this an incidental problem found on apre-sale exam? If so, recommendations should bemade based on the intended use of the horse. What is the intended use of the horse? Is this a Thoroughbred (TB) racehorse, an eventer, jumper,dressage horse, show horse, draft horse, Westernperformance horse, pleasure horse, etc.? The tie-back procedure is needed more for horses that per-form using strenuous physical exertion for extendedperiods. For example, an accomplished event horseis more likely to benet from a tie-back than a showhunter. However, if exercise intolerance from RLNis a problem for a horse regardless of discipline, atie-back would likely be benecial. It should benoted that, although not commonly used, a nervetransplant surgery may be of benet in a sport horsewith an anticipated long career. 1 What is the age of the horse? Generally, in the author's opinion and that of others, tie-back proce-dures should not be performed prior to about 24months of age, as the cartilage does not hold thesuture as well in an immature horse. Also, in theauthor's opinion, left arytenoid paresis in the imma-ture TB (long yearling) may best be approached with a nerve transplant surgery. 1It often takes /H110226 months to see the results of the nerve transplantsurgery and during this period it is usually too earlyto perform a tie-back procedure. 448 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSCURRENT CONCEPTS IN THE ENDOSCOPIC EVALUATION OF THE UPPER AIRWAY NOTES2. What Do the Diagnostic Tests Show? Physical Exam During the physical exam, are there abnormalities other than arytenoid paralysis that could adverselyaffect performance of the cricoid andthyroid cartilages on the affected side. UA Endoscopic Exam at Rest During the endoscopic exam, are any abnormalitiesnoted other than abnormal arytenoid cartilagemovement? What is the arytenoid movementgrade at rest (nasal occlusion being part of thisexam)? In competition horses, grade IV and mostgrade III arytenoids will collapse during exerciseand need a tie-back paresis. Laryngeal Ultrasound Exam The laryngeal ultrasound exam is a very helpful toolfor examining the UA. 3Are the left cricoarytenoid lateralis and vocalis muscles hyperechoic when com-pared to the right? This is a very reliable ultrasono-graphic nding in support of RLN. Is the leftcricoarytenoid dorsalis muscle smaller than the right?This is also proving to be a useful ultrasonographicnding supporting RLN. 4Is the arytenoid cartilage of abnormal size and shape? With chondritis thearytenoid is usually thickened. Is there evidence oflaryngeal dysplasia? The hallmarks of this abnor-mality are lack of the cricothyroid joint and a thyroidcartilage that extends further dorsal than the muscu-lar process of the arytenoid cartilage. The ultrasoundexam ndings regarding changes to the laryngealmusculature are not consistent in long yearlings andvery early in the development of RLN. UA Endoscopic Exam During Exercise This exam is now usually done with remote over-ground endoscopy rather than on the treadmill andremains the gold standard for evaluation of aryte-noid cartilage function. Does the arytenoid carti-lage collapse during strenuous exercise? Do anyother tissues collapse into the airway? Do both ar-ytenoid cartilages collapse when the head is flexed(dynamic laryngeal collapse)? The latter conditionis more commonly seen in Norwegian Cold-BloodedTrotters, Saddlebreds, and Hackney ponies. 3. Does the Client Understand the Possible Complications Following a Tie-Back Procedure? Inadequate Abduction (Failed Tie-Back) A failed tie-back is not uncommon. This is gener- ally the result of the sutures cutting into the carti-lage. This may require another tie-back procedure,which is generally more effective than approachingthis with an arytenoidectomy. Aspiration and Coughing Aspiration and coughing is not common. This isgenerally a result of an adverse affect on swallowingmechanics, with ingesta gaining access to the air-way. This can be, but is not always associated withexcessive abduction. Surgical Site Infection Surgical site infection is not common. This is usu-ally associated initially with a postop seroma. Gen-erally easy to resolve if promptly addressed. Suture Penetrating into the Airway Lumen A suture penetrating into the airway lumen is veryuncommon. This should be noticed during surgicalplacement of the sutures using intraop endoscopy. Chondritis Chrondritis is very uncommon. 4. Conclusions In summary, assuming the diagnosis of RLN is ac-curate, in horses where the problem is performancelimiting or will be performance limiting (e.g., 2-year-old TB racehorse), a tie-back procedure should beconsidered. In horses where UA noise is the pri-mary problem, a bilateral VCE may be adequate toresolve the noise.

Introduction For the purposes of this presentation, arytenoid chondropathy refers to any disease affecting thestructure of the cartilage or the mucosal covering.The varied presentations in general include ulcers,granulomas, chondromas, and chondritis (active andinactive). Ulcers are areas loss over thecartilage. Granulomas refer to granulation typetissue protruding the lumen the larynx fromthe cartilage surface. Chondromas refer to carti-lage masses protruding into the lumen of the larynxfrom the cartilage surface that are covered by mu-cosa. Chondritis refers to thickened cartilage,which can be active and inflamed, or inactive andquiet. The disease is usually unilateral, affecting the left or right side, but can be bilateral. The cause ofthese abnormalities is likely the result of inflamma-tion. The cause of the inflammation is likely re-lated to infection. More than likely the mucosalintegrity has been compromised, allowing bacteriato gain access to the submucosal tissue andcartilage. 2. Clinical Signs The most common clinical sign seen with arytenoidchondritis, granulomas, or chondromas is upper air-way (UA) noise. Mucosal ulcers or small granulo-mas may be found in yearlings on a presale examthat make no noticeable UA noise. 1Arytenoid chondritis is noticed in athletes early in the course ofthe disease as small changes in the larynx createairflow turbulence and UA noise. Chondritis inbroodmares and pleasure horses is generally notnoticed until the arytenoid is large enough to createUA noise at a walk or trot. Broodmares that areaffected are often in respiratory distress when rstnoticed. 3. Diagnostics Arytenoid cartilage structural abnormalities aregenerally easily diagnosed during an endoscopicexam of the UA. However, some abnormalities canbe subtle, e.g., slight thickening of an arytenoid car-tilage may mimic an arytenoid with grade III move-ment. An ultrasound exam can be very usefuldiagnostically. 2The size and thickness of the ary- tenoid can be evaluated. Abnormal echogenicity ofthe cartilage and/or tissues around it can be noted,including the status of the laryngeal musculature. 4. Mucosal Ulcers Mucosal ulcers are infrequently found, usually justdorsal to the area of the vocal process of the aryte-noid. These presumably form from excessive con-tact between the left and right arytenoids, possiblyalso related to concurrent UA inflammation. Theyare more commonly found in athletes, but have been 450 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSCURRENT CONCEPTS IN THE ENDOSCOPIC EVALUATION OF THE UPPER AIRWAY NOTESfound in Thoroughbred sales yearlings. The ulcers generally respond to decreased exercise, anti-inflammatory medication, and antibiotics. 5. Granulomas Granulomas of varying size can protrude into thelaryngeal lumen. The base of the granuloma usu-ally starts at the cartilage surface and many actu-ally form around an entrance to a tract thatcontinues into the arytenoid cartilage. These usu-ally can be resected endoscopically with a laseror laryngeal or can be approached througha laryngotomy. It is difcult to predict which gran-ulomas will reform, which is not unusual. 6. Chondromas Chondromas are generally mucosal covered inactivecartilage masses that protrude into the lumen of thelarynx. The adjacent body of the arytenoid carti-lage is often mildly thickened. If the arytenoid canabduct reasonably well, these masses are best leftalone. 7. Chondritis The arytenoid can vary greatly in thickness. As mentioned above, a slightly thickened arytenoid maylook like a grade III arytenoid. An ultrasound examhelps make an accurate diagnosis in these cases.An endoscopic exam during exercise in questionablecases may also be helpful to determine the appropriatetreatment. Most arytenoid chondritis cases are obvi-ous during an endoscopic exam. Acute cases showactive inflammation with reddening and swelling ofthe laryngeal tissues. The inflammation also affectsthe surrounding tissues. Initially these horsesshould be treated aggressively medically to reduce thesize of the inflamed tissues. Treatment should in-clude systemic antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflam-matory drugs, and steroids. Nebulizing the UA /H11006a throat spray is helpful. Once the arytenoid cartilagebecomes thickened, it is very difcult to signicantlyreduce the size of the cartilage. As the cartilage itselfbecomes thickened, the cartilaginous tissue separatesand the center lls with brous tissue. The broustissue core does not reduce in size. Thus, the carti-lage remains enlarged. The recommended treatment for horses with a clinically signicant enlarged arytenoid cartilage isarytenoidectomy. Many athletes can still performfollowing this procedure. 3,4However, very few can reach the level of performance that they had previ-ously achieved. For bilaterally affected horses,e.g., broodmares, removal of the largest arytenoidcartilage or a permanent tracheotomy is benecial.

Introduction in right-sided laryngeal function in horses are seen infrequently. There are causes ofloss Damage to the right recurrent laryngeal nerve andsubsequent partial or complete loss of right-sidedarytenoid function is rare and nearly always associ-ated with some sort of trauma to the nerve. Right-sided laryngeal hemiplegia (ILH), similar tofar more common left-sided ILH, probably does not occur. The most common recognized causes ofright-sided laryngeal hemiplegia (LH) are perivas-cular injections, leaking or malpositioned IV cathe-ters, direct blunt or penetrating trauma to the neck,or infectious processes resulting in abscessation inthe laryngeal or perilaryngeal regions (e.g., stran-gles, cellulitis in the neck). In many cases it ispossible to elucidate a history of previous right jug-ular venipuncture or catheterization or there may bean obvious thrombophlebitis present on physical ex-amination. Occasionally there will also be damageto the adjacent vagosympathetic trunk resulting insigns of Horner's Syndrome. The endoscopic ndings will be identical to the typical ndings seen with left-sided ILH and theyare graded in the same manner. There should also be obvious (by either laryngeal palpation orlaryngeal 1). The treatment options areconservative (anti-inflammatory therapy includingNSAIDs and steroids) in acute cases and surgical(right-sided laryngoplasty) in chronic cases. Theprognosis for return to athletic function should besimilar to the prognosis for left-sided ILH as long asadequate and long-lasting abduction of the rightarytenoid is achieved. 3. Arytenoid Chondropathy Loss of right-sided function in cases of arytenoidchondropathy is due to a mechanical inability of theaffected arytenoid to abduct because the enlargedarytenoid impinges on the adjacent thyroid carti-lage. The degree of loss of function is directly re- lated to the amount and direction of arytenoid bodyenlargement and can vary from no loss of function tocomplete inability to abduct the arytenoid and po-tentially even further of enlargement of the arytenoid. The endoscopic ndings are well recognized and are characterized by one or more of the following:1) misshapen, \"S\" shaped, or enlarged granulation tissue orthickened epithelialized into the 452 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSCURRENT CONCEPTS IN THE ENDOSCOPIC EVALUATION OF THE UPPER AIRWAY NOTESlaryngeal lumen, or 3) unilateral rostral displace- ment of the palatopharyngeal arch. It is importantto recognize that there should be no CAD muscleatrophy detected on laryngeal palpation (or CALatrophy on ultrasound exam), emphasizing the use-fulness of learning one or both techniques in evalu-ating any laryngeal function abnormality (Fig. 2). The treatment options depend to some degree on the chronicity of the problem and the degree of loss offunction. Acute chondropathies with associated la-ryngeal edema should always be treated m edically (antibiotics, topical and systemic steroids, andNSAIDs), regardless of the degree of function loss.In some cases, complete function may return once theedema has resolved. In more chronic cases with onlyslight loss of function, medical therapy or medicaltherapy in association with laser removal of axial lu-minal granulation tissue and cauterization of drainingtracts is indicated. Once chronic arytenoid enlarge-ment has caused a signicant loss in function, the onlyoption is a partial arytenoidectomy. It is important torecognize that a tie-back procedure will not work inthese cases because the laryngoplasty sutures will notbe able to abduct the arytenoid any further than thenormal CAD muscle is able to abduct it due to themechanical impingement of the enlarged arytenoid onthe lamina of the thyroid cartilage. 4. Fourth Branchial Arch Defects Fourth branchial arch defects (4-BADs) are seenfrequently enough as a cause of upper airway prob-lems that they must be in the differential diagnosis for any loss of arytenoid function with normal endo-scopic anatomy (e.g., no arytenoid enlargement).In fact, a 4-BAD should be the primary differentialin right-sided function abnormalities until provenotherwise. The distribution of 4-BADs is 65% rightsided, 10% left sided, and 25% bilateral. 1 The embryonic fourth branchial arches are re- sponsible for the formation of the wings of the thy-roid cartilages, the cricothyroid articulations, the cricothyroid muscles, and the cricopharyngeus andthyropharyngeus muscles (upper esophageal sphinc- ter). The primary clinical signs are variable de-grees of exercise intolerance and upper airway noise.The degree of exercise intolerance with the conditionis extremely variable with some horses unable toperform even low-level athletic activity whereas oth-ers are able to race successfully. Less common clin-ical signs are chronic colic and dysphagia related tothe abnormal upper esophageal sphincter. In casesof 4-BAD the CAD muscle is normal but the aryte-noid does not abduct due to either a mechanicalimpingement of the arytenoid on a thyroid laminathat extends dorsal to the muscular process or, per-haps more likely, an abnormal course of the CADmuscle due to rotation of the cricoid cartilage andloss of the caudal cornu of the thyroid cartilage onthe affected side resulting in the larynx forming anincomplete \"box\" with one side of the box unable tosupport the contraction of the CAD muscle.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 453CURRENT CONCEPTS ENDOSCOPIC EVALUATION OF THE UPPER AIRWAYThe endoscopic ndings in unilateral cases of 4-BAD can look exactly like cases of laryngeal hemi- plegia. There is usually some loss of function onthe affected side with otherwise-normal endoscopicanatomy. In bilateral 4-BAD cases there is palatopharyngeal arch(so-called hemiplegia from a 4-BAD. In the case of a4-BAD, the muscular process will be difcult to iden-tify due to dorsal extension of the thyroid cartilagelamina. In addition, there will be a palpable spacebetween the caudal cornu of the thyroid cartilageand the cricoid cartilage due to the absence of acricothyroid articulation. An ultrasound exam ofthe larynx is diagnostic and unless there is a clearand incontrovertible history of the horse havingpreviously normal laryngeal function, horses withright-sided loss of laryngeal function should have anultrasound exam of the larynx performed to rule out4-BAD before considering tie-back surgery. Theultrasound in 4-BAD cases 1) cricothyroid articulation, 2) the thyroid carti-lage extends dorsal to the muscular process, and 3)the CAL muscle is in an abnormal location (thespace between the thyroid and cricoid cartilages).There is currently no surgical treatment for the con-dition, although in some horses that are able toperform at near normal levels of their intended use,management of secondary dynamic airway prob- lems disclosed by over the ground endoscopy canimprove performance and reduce or eliminate upperairway noise. While resting endoscopy is extremely useful and essential in evaluating abnormalities in laryngealfunction, some laryngeal problems laryngeal palpation and/or la-ryngeal ultrasound is nearly always needed in thesecases to make an accurate diagnosis. This is par-ticularly true when evaluating right-sided abnor-malities and when considering surgery.

Materials and Methods Sixty-ve horses aged 8 months to 2 years wererandomly assigned to the CCFA (N /H1100533) or PPG (N/H1100532) treatment groups. Horses were castrated using general anesthesia and closed castration tech-nique with scrotal ablation. Measurements ofquantitative (serum amyloid A values, protein) and qual-itative (scrotal preoperatively and postoperatively on days3, 8, and 14. Complications in the post-operativeperiod were recorded.3. Results No clinically signicant difference in any post-oper- ative inflammatory markers between the CCFA andPPG group was detected. In the CCFA group 48%of horses experienced post-operative complicationscompared to 31% in the PPG edema (P /H11021.0001) at day 3. These values re- turned to baseline levels by day 8. Horses withgrade 3 or above preputial edema were also found tohave elevated serum amyloid A values (P /H11021.001). 4. Discussion The data from this study indicates CCFA used as apre-operative antibiotic for routine castration offersno advantages over PPG. The difference in compli-cation rate between groups is likely of minimal clin-ical importance as all complications were mild andself limiting.

Introduction Prior research has identied lumbosacral anatomi- cal variations and physeal closure abnormalities inQuarter Horses (QHs) investigated for lumbar ver-tebral fracture. Therefore, the study objectiveswere to characterize anatomy and growth plate clo-sure of the lumbosacral vertebrae in QHs. 2. Materials and Methods Lumbosacral specimens were collected from 16 QHshumanely euthanized for reasons other than lumbo-sacral disease (aged 0 to 22 years old). Specimenswere assessed using computed tomographic, gross,and histological (H&E) examination. 3. Results Six were found in 15/16 (94%)cases, with dorsal spinous process divergence at L5to L6 in 3/16 (19%) cases. Physeal inactivity waspresent in cases as young as 4 months of age, withL4 to S1 physes inactive in all cases 2 years of age orolder. Residual physeal cartilage was present incases 5 to 8 years of Chondrocyte disorganiza-tion (7/12; 58%) and retention (11/12; 92%) in cases with unfused physes. Lumbosa-cral articular facet present in 11/16(69%) cases. Articular subchondral linear lucencywith associated sclerosis was present in 9/16 (56%)cases (aged 4 months to 22 years). 4.

Introduction Tibial stress fractures are a common cause of acute hindlimb lameness in racehorses. Complete tibialfractures cause /H110113% of deaths in racehorses. It is unknown if pre-existing stress fractures are associ-ated with tibial fractures. 2. Materials and Methods Necropsy reports of 115 racehorses that had a com-plete tibial fracture (1990-2018) were retrospec-tively reviewed. Signalment and exercise historiesof affected horses were compared to those of race-horses that died because of non-tibial musculoskel-etal injury or non-musculoskeletal cause and ofcontrol live racehorses (chi-square, Fisher's exacttest, matched logistic regression [ P/H113490.05)]). 3. Results Most fractures occurred during training (68%) andin 2- to 3-year-old horses (73%). Most horses (97%)had unilateral fractures without side predisposition. Most fractures were diaphyseal 44 and oblique(40%). Of 61 fractures examined for callus, 64% had periosteal callus associated with the fracture. Callus most prevalent in the proximolateralcortex (72%) and caudal cortex of the racehorses exercise his-tory, 57% never raced, and 36% had recordedlayup period, and those horses were /H113493 years of age. Affected horses had fewer high-speedevents, cumulative distances, and active careerdays than control horses. 4. Discussion Tibial fractures were associated with pre-existingstress fracture early in a horse's career. Most cat-astrophic fractures were associated with proximolat-eral stress fractures, which may be challenging todetect clinically. 462 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSNEW INNOVATIONS AND TIMELY CONSIDERATIONS IN EQUINE LAMENESS AND SURGERY Research Abstract /L50093for more information, contact the corresponding author NOTESAcknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Authors have adhered to the Principles of Veter- inary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.Conflict of Interest The Authors have no conflicts of interest.

Introduction Bisphosphonates are potent antiresorptive agents that have been used for several years in humanmedicine. There are currently no reports describ-ing the residence time in horse bone; however, inhumans, bisphosphonates can remain in bone foryears, equating to an extended pharmacologiceffect. Knowledge of the residence time of bis-phosphonates in bone could allow for a better un-derstanding of the long-term effects of thesecompounds and ultimately more judicious use.To that end, the objective of this study was tobegin to characterize the disposition of bisphos-phonates in the bone of horses. 2. Materials and Methods Two horses received clodronatea(1.8 mg/kg [intra- muscular]) and two tiludronate disodiumb(1 mg/kg[intravenous]). Bone and teeth were collected at 4 days from 1 horse in each drug group and at 30 daysfrom the second horse in each group. Additionally,postmortem blood, synovial fluid, aqueous humor,and bone samples from racehorses with various his-tories of bisphosphonate administration were col-lected and concentrations determined. 3. Results and Discussion Clodronate and tiludronate concentrations exceededthe highest calibrator (0.338 /H9262g/gram) in all bones and teeth tested at 4 and 30 days postadministra-tion. In a post-mortem sample, clodronate was de-tected at concentrations exceeding 0.338 /H9262g/gram in bone from a horse with a reported administration of18 months. This drug was not detected in othersample types collected from this horse. 464 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSNEW INNOVATIONS AND TIMELY CONSIDERATIONS IN EQUINE LAMENESS AND SURGERY Research Abstract /L50093for more information, contact the corresponding author NOTESAcknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Authors have adhered to the Principles of Veter- inary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.Conflict of Interest The Authors have no conflicts of interest.

It is important for equine practitio- ners, technicians/nurses, and their staff to know how to safely, efciently, and effectively restrainanimals without injury either to the horse or to personnel. Every equine practitioner and technician/nurse is expected to perform this task on demand, but is taught on the job.

Introduction Horses that are \"down\" in recumbency experience fear, they may cause self injury, or they may injurea person while struggling to rise. The musculosk-eletal region of the neck is a powerful lever and isused by the horse to rise from recumbency. Thus,restraint by a handler (Fig. 1) is useful to minimizestruggling while the practitioner is deciding on a protocol for treatment, chemical restraint, or eutha- nasia. Rotating the head back, aligned with the neck, and tipping the nose up delays the horse's attempts to roll into a sternal position, then stand. 1,2Even if a horse is physically incapable of standing, such aswhile waking up from general anesthesia, it canmake uncoordinated efforts to stand and flail (Fig. 2)due to powerful flight instincts if sympathetically stimulated. 3Legacy Knee-on-Neck Method The Legacy \"knee-in-the-neck, tip-the-nose-up\" method has been used for gen erations, especially since effective chemical sedation and anesthesiaweren't available to equine practitioners until the20th century (Fig. 3). This Legacy method of at-tempting to hold down a laterally recumbent horseduring clinical veterinary procedures places thehandler's knee onto the neck of the horse, usingthe full weight and pressure of a kneeling personto physically restrain the horse, then the handleruses upper body strength to rotate the head andtip the nose skyward by pulling on the halter. Legacy methods have caused injuries to personnelvia kick, strike, and ergonomic injuries. Practi-tioners, technicians/nurses, and professional ani-mal handlers in the industry share personalnarratives of being thrust backward, kicked orstruck by a hoof, or suffering rope injury while 466 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSNEW INNOVATIONS AND TIMELY CONSIDERATIONS IN EQUINE LAMENESS AND SURGERY NOTESattempting to hold down a 1,000-lb (453-kg) or larger recumbent horse.a,b Clearly, a larger, heavier, and stronger person increases the odds of success at restraining an ani-mal that is far quicker, stronger, and heavier thanone person, or even several persons.

Legacymethods have resulted in injuries to personnel in-cluding ergonomic injuries (back, hip, knees) by peo-ple attempting to rise; horses striking with the hindfoot to the person on the head; horse rolling to ster-nal then standing reflexively faster than the hu-man's ability to get out of the way when the horsestands up; and pulling the handler headlong into thespace between the neck and front legs while strug-gling, etc. d Fire/rescue organizations work hard to reduce ex- posure and in juries to re/rescue personnel re- sponding to incident scenes, depending on \"lessonslearned\" and they make continual improvementsto methods and techniques to increase safety. 4 Hard questions about obvious risks of using theLegacy method (Fig. 4) have been asked by rstresponders. Over the years, re/rescue organiza-tions adopted mandatory improvements to equinerestraint methodologies taught to their personnelfor large-animal rescue\u2014including rejection of theLegacy and adoption of the \"foot-on-neck\" method. These restraint improvements are shared herewith veterinary professionals to improve safety foranyone involved in response to recumbent equinesituations. Modern best practices as taught to re/rescue per- sonnel now include an improved \"foot-on-neck\"method that provides greater leverage for the han-dler while increasing the handler's ability to moveout of the way of a lunging animal (Fig. 5). Itimproves personal safety for animal handlers whileallowing improved jugular and facial area access forthe equine practitioner (IV access, catheterizationand maintenance, facial artery pulse, ocular re-flexes, and oral mucous membrane evaluation.) 2.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 AND SURGERYDescription of Foot-on-Neck Method \"Best practices\" for handling as taught to re/rescue personnel (who are commonly not familiar withhorses) include restraint methods for lateral recum-bence to provide greater control to the handler at thehead, while increasing their leverage and weightadvantage. This increases the handler's ability tomove out of the way if the horse struggles to get up,keeps personnel out of the way of flailing hooves,and prevents potential ergonomic injuries by allow-ing the handler's weight to be balanced on their legsinstead of kneeling. The \"foot-on-neck\" method is more ergonomic. It allows the animal handler to use the lead-rope forleverage to tip the nose skyward, while placing thebottom of their foot on the neck of the horse (directlybehind the atlanto-occipital joint; Fig. 6) and usingtheir body weight to discourage the horse from ris-ing. Tipping the nose up slightly is desirable as itmakes it more difcult for the horse to rise, 7and keeps the animal handler out of the way of the neck.This also provides the veterinarian with better ac-cess to the jugular vein (catheter insertion andmaintenance, administration of drugs) and the fa-cial area (assessment of capillary rell times, facialartery pulse, orbital, and oral mucous membranes).It is still possible for a trained animal handler toassess respiratory rate (watching chest rise or nos-tril movements), assess ear and eye reactions, andcover the eye with a blindfold while holding in thismanner (Fig. 7). 3. Results Horses do not instinctively comprehend how to lethumans help them, nor do they have the capacity tounderstand that the responders' intent is to help.When dealing with a fearful recumbent horse, per-sonnel must adopt defensive strategies to stay safe. e One person (the handler) must maintain control ofthe head until the animal is evaluated, treated, re-covered completely, euthanized, or packaging iscomplete (if using a rescue glide for transport).Dangerous places for humans to be positioned in-clude directly in front of the legs or head, betweenthe legs, or standing over/above a recumbent horse(Fig. 8). All personnel must stay clear of the horse'slegs (recumbent horses can flail or struggle with nowarning). Fig. 8.

Complacency, lackof exposure, or inappropriate training may causehandlers to underestimate the extreme weight,strength, and speed of a recumbent horse. Controlof the head is crucial to equine restraint. The han-dler should place a halter and lead-rope or emer-gency rope halter on the recumbent horse beforedoing anything else. Next, place some type of headprotection (towel, shirt, cheap human personal floa- tation device, Ha \u00a8st Head Protector, for similar full head protection device) on and under the horse'shead. Special attention should be paid to preven-tion of nerve paralysis and myopathy, and efcientrecoveries prevent medical issues seen with slowresponse. gA blindfold should be used to protect the eyes and limit visual stimulation. From theirstanding position, the handler can watch the horsefor movement reflexes, observe breathing rate bywatching the chest rise, and report changes in mus-cle flaccidity or reflexes, while the veterinarian canaccess the head and neck more freely. 4. Discussion In both clinical and eld\u2014owners, veterinarians,staff, and rst responders have been injured by re-cumbent horses while attempting to assist or treatthem. hProper restraint by a trained animal han- dler, with or without sedation/anesthesia, preventsneedless injuries to both humans and horses.

The handler, in full personal protective equip-ment and under direction of a veterinarian, has assessed minimalconcern for struggling; thus, she is supporting the head on herknees in preparation for adding head protection. However, thisis a difcult position to arise from quickly if the animal shouldstruggle. Photo courtesy of Washington State Animal ResponseTeam. Fig. 10.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 471NEW INNOVATIONS AND TIMELY CONSIDERATIONS IN EQUINE LAMENESS AND SURGERYmic to the point of not struggling, animals should be profoundly sedated or anesthetized for procedures toreduce the chance of injury to personnel. The Horse's Perspective Recumbency, from the perspective of the animal, isvery different from human perception. Horses thatmay appear to be lying calmly are extremelystressed and fearful (Fig. 9). Recumbent horses of-ten lie quietly for a few minutes due to exhaustion,but their instinct drives them to struggle unpredict-ably and violently. The primary problem of recum-bency quickly becomes overshadowed by thesecondary problems (decrease in gut motility, downlung congestion, nerve and muscle impingement anddamage), thus a plan must be made efciently to getthe horse to the recovery position (sternal), then onits feet. 8 For many technical rescue manipulations, the an- imal handler must be able to lift, support, and movethe head in coordination with the team rolling, slid-ing, moving, and/or packaging the recumbent horsepatient. 9Standardization of animal handler train- ing for technical animal rescues by the re service isongoing. 10,11 Factors To Consider What is the weight and size of the horse? Is there an injury to the horse's neck or headthat prevents use of this method? What is the disposition/breed/reactivity of thehorse? Is the horse in pain? Has analgesia beenadministered? Training: Does the animal handler have ex-perience and training with use of physical re-straint of mannequins iand real recumbent horses? Are they in a safe position? Equipment: Does the handler have a goodquality halter and lead-rope to maintain con-trol of the head, with head protection or at aminimum a towel to use as a blindfold? Is there egress room for handler or are thereobstacles? What is footing quality? Are there going to be questions from observersabout why you are using this method thatlooks different from past methods (i.e., stand-ing versus knee in neck)? Obstacles Add Danger Recumbent animals in certain scenarios (connedspace: entrapped in an overturned trailer, with aleg through the bars of a stall) are subject to abnor-mal orientation and make for extremely dangerouspositions for the animal handler. Always consideradministration of sedation (IM, oral) before puttingany handler into such a dangerous position (Fig. 10).5. Conclusion Use of these updated methods and simple equip-ment with personal protective equipment will con-tribute to effective equine restraint and improvedergonomic and kinetic safety for veterinary handlerpersonnel while allowing successful and efcientoutcomes of lateral recumbency in clinical, eld, andtechnical rescue incidents.

However, the infor-mation on this disease in the equine veterinary lit-erature is sparse. 1-4The disease is frustrating to treat, labor intensive on the part of the caregiver,and is often non-responsive to treatment. CBD isdescribed as an idiopathic defect in cornication ofthe coronary band that predominately affects theheavy breeds of horses, a,bbut in the study described in this paper, the cases were either Warmblood or Warmblood-cross horses. There appears to be noapparent age or gender predisposition, all fourhooves are generally affected to a variable extent,and long-term treatment may often be palliativerather than curative. 1An immune-mediated path- way appears to be the logical explanation as thedisease is responsive to systemic corticosteroids andrecently, a report describing methotrexate beingused to treat CBD appears to be promising. cThe response to these two drugs may indicate that theterm, CBD, is not actually correct and that chronicimmune-mediated coronitis may be more appropri-ate. A form of pemphigus foliaceus termed pemphi-gus coronitis has been incriminated but has not beencompletely proven. This report describes the suc-cessful (although it must be emphasized, not cura-tive) treatment of greater than 20 horses that were diagnosed with CBD. Interestingly, 7 horses sub-sequently developed chronic proliferative pododer-matitis (canker) secondary to CBD. 2. Materials and Methods The records of 18 horses treated for CBD from 2015until the end of 2019 were reviewed. Horses wereselected from referral cases that had severe clinicalsigns of hyperkeratosis of the coronary bands involv-ing all 4 feet and where other causes for theselesions could be excluded. The form of hyperkera-tosis noted consisted of the formation of thick crustson the coronet, showed hemorrhage and ulcerationwhen removed, interfered with normal hoof wallgrowth, and did not respond to routine veterinarycare. Furthermore, the lesions were not limited tothe coronet but also appeared on the bulbs of theheels and the base of the frog. The breed distinc- tion was either Warmblood or Warmblood crossedwith Thoroughbred. Interestingly, quite a few ofthese horses (6) were imported to the United Statesat least a year prior to showing clinical signs. Sexwas divided into 10 geldings, 7 mares, and 1 stallionand were aged between 7 and 18 years. The bulk ofthe cases were either treated by or personally over-seen by the author while the remainder of the horseswere treated through the author's consulting prac-tice and although there were good follow-up reports AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 473NEW INNOVATIONS AND TIMELY CONSIDERATIONS IN EQUINE LAMENESS AND SURGERY NOTESfrom the caregivers, the results could not be person- ally veried. Clinical Signs When the horse is presented with CBD, the horsemay or may not show lameness depending on theextent of the disease. In general, the coronarybands are proliferative with crusting, scaling, vari-able erythema, in-stances, the ergots and chestnuts are also affectedwith the same lesions. 1-4Hooves may be thickened with poor consistency of the hoof wall, irregularridges, scaling and closely packed growth rings.While the severity of the disease may vary, the initial changes at the coronary band may be subtle but can rapidly progress until the clinical signs areapparent. Generally, the hair that lays flat againstthe proximal coronet will begin to rise off the coronetand the proximal extent of the coronet will begin tothicken. As the disease progresses, a thin bead ofdark brown, eroded, soft horn will be noted justbelow the hair and the hair will begin to stickstraight out. At this point, hoof wall growth distal to the coronet will decrease as noted by the tightlypacked growth rings (Fig. 1). Over time, the coro-net at the hairline will swell, the bead of soft hornwill enlarge, and the hoof wall below the abnormalhorn will show crusts and scaling. The abnormalhorn will start to widen toward the heels and thenextend over the bulbs of the heels down to the frog(Fig. 2, A and B). In the palmar or plantar sectionof the foot, the abnormal growth at the coronet at theheels will grow down into the hoof capsule and thecrusted horn will grow distally and cover the bulbextending to the frog. The hair overlying the bulbswill now be standing erect. The crusted horn willoften crack, ulcerate, and a clear serous exudatemay be present. At this point, the abnormal hornmay extend onto the surface of the frog if the frog islocated below the ground surface of the hoof wall atthe heels or ultimately may develop canker if thefrog is recessed between the walls of the hoof cap-sule. In some cases, the thick crusted horn thatcovers the bulbs of the heels and the base of the frogwill turn into a light brown, soft epithelium that iscovering a caseous white exudate that resemblescottage cheese. This type of tissue is indicative ofproliferative pododermatitis or canker. 5Horses may be lame if the CBD is so severe that there isulceration at the coronet, a deep ssure present at Fig. 1.

A complete blood count andserum chemistry was performed on each horse andfound to be within normal limits. Diagnosis A tentative diagnosis is made on the clinical appear-ance and progression of the lesions localized to thecoronet and heel bulbs. A denitive diagnosis isattained by ruling out other skin conrmed with noted that conrmation of pemphigus requiresimmunofluorescence staining which is com-monly done nor commonly available. dAn inci- sional biopsy was obtained under local anesthesiafrom the coronet at the junction of the heel quarterand the heel bulb. The biopsy reports in thisstudy showed the epidermis to be hyperplasticwith marked acanthosis and the formation of longpapillary fronds in the dermis. A moderate layerof orthokeratosis hyperkeratosis covered the sur-face of the epithelium over the coronary band der-mis (Fig. 4A). Increased numbers of lymphocytesand plasma cells can be seen in the dermal papilla(Fig. 4B). The presence of lymphoid cells in thedermis is potentially compatible with an immune-mediated condition. cA recently published pa- thology paper has an excellent photomicrograph ofa section of the coronet illustrating the histologyof CBD (Fig. 4C). As the biopsies were similar inthe rst few cases in this report, biopsies werediscontinued because the wounds were difcult toheal. Treatment Medication Treatment is labor-intensive and an owner/client commitment is necessary for success. The horse isplaced on a descending dose of oral prednisolone e administered at 1 mg/kg q24h for 10 days, 0.5 mg/kg, q24h for 10 days, and 0.25 mg/kg, q24h for 10days. 6After 30 days, the dose is continually de- creased, and the days of administration are spacedfurther apart until the lowest possible dose to pre-vent reoccurrence is administered once or twiceweekly. Also, at the onset of treatment, minocycli-ne fis given orally at 4 mg/kg, q12h in an attempt to treat any possible low-grade infection present in thecoronary band. 7Firocoxibgis given orally at 171 mg, q24h for 3 days as a loading dose,8and the 57 mg, q24h for a total of 14 days.

Topical Treatment of the Coronet If the clinician does not perform this type of work,the initial foot care should be performed with aninterested and skilled farrier. Most of these casesshow either poor hoof conformation or hoof capsuledistortion conformation. Im-proving the foot conformation will redistribute theforces on the solar surface of the foot which in turnwill decrease the stresses on the coronet. To ac-complish the appropriate farriery, the author hasfound the best method is to remove the shoes ini-tially and begin treatment in the barefoot state.If the frog is prolapsed below the hoof wall and thereis a ssure in the central sulci of the frog, leaving thehorse barefoot will reposition the frog to the sameplane as the heels of the hoof capsule, the ssurewill heal and the frog will no longer be trauma-tized. Otherwise, the heels of the hoof capsuleare trimmed to where the frog and the hoof cap-sule are on the same plane and the rest of the hoofcapsule is shaped as described in a recent paper onbarefoot methodology. 9 The horse is mildly sedated with the clinician's medication of choice allowing the horse to remaincoordinated. The hair around the entire coronaryband is clipped using a number 40 surgical clipperblade. All loose exfoliating horn is removed fromthe frog with a sharp hoof knife. The affected hoofis placed on a farrier foot stand and the bulk of theabnormal hoof wall, crusts, and scales are removedwith the smooth side of a farrier rasp. The sameprocedure is performed over the bulbs of the heels tothe base of the frog. A medium-grit sanding blockis then used to continue sanding the coronet andbulbs until there is a clear demarcation betweenthe skin and the coronet. Following debridement,there may be some serous exudate or mild hemor-rhage in which case a dry bandage can be placed for24 hours. The horse is bedded with wood shavingsor sawdust for the drying effect and turned out in asmall dry paddock for a few hours per day if dry.The wear on the frog should not exceed new horngrowth being produced, so it is important that thefooting is not too hard, or shoes can be replaced ifnecessary. The coronary bands are cleaned everyfew days with a medium grit sanding block, thenwiped with a moist gauze pad with saline and a thinlayer of either a hydrocortisone a betamethasone 0.5%/allantoin 1.5% ointmentiis ap- plied. The frogs are cleaned daily with a wirebrush and then painted with solution of benzoylperoxide in 10% acetone j. This treatment is contin- ued by the horse's caretaker until the new growthhas normalized and then as needed if symptomsbegin to return (Fig. 5). Canker Seven of the horses developed canker in various feetsubsequent to showing signs of CBD. This mayshow a correlation between the two disease entitiesand CBD may predispose the foot to canker. Thegross appearance of canker is generally diagnostic,but a biopsy is always an option for conrmation inthese cases. The is generally read out aschronic proliferative pododermatitis. 10The coro- nary bands and the bulbs showing CBD weretreated as described earlier in the text. Briefly, thetreatment of canker consists of placing a tourniquetabove the fetlock to provide a bloodless eld whichwill enhance careful and thorough debridement ofall disease tissue to where there is a clear demarca-tion between normal and abnormal tissue. The de-marcation can be observed by a change in theappearance and consistency of the frog along withsmall pin-point hemorrhages noted in the tissue.Debridement is then followed by cryotherapy. Ben-zoyl peroxide in 10% acetone combined with metro-nidazole powder is applied to the debrided area andthe foot is bandaged. The bandages are changedevery second day, the debrided tissue is cleaned witha suitable mild antiseptic solution, rinsed with sa- Fig. 5.

Once the frogs havehealed and cornied, the treatment continues asoutlined for CBD (Fig. 6). The treatment may seeminvolved but can be performed very efciently by thehorse's caretaker on a daily or every-second-day ba-sis in a short period of time. 3. Results All horses in this study responded to the describedtreatment protocol and returned to full work. Suc-cess was described as marked improvement in coro-nary band and hoof appearance within 3 to 6 weeksafter treatment was initiated. In addition, horsesreturned to full work when shoes were replaced,horses had an acceptable macroscopic appearance ofthe coronary band and hoof wall, required minimaldaily foot care, and were able to be reduced to atleast every-other-day steroid administration and re-main disease free (Fig. 7, A-C). Again, it must beemphasized, that due to the suspected genetic andauto-immune implications of this disease, perma-nent remission is generally not achieved.4. Discussion To the author's knowledge, there are only two re- ports in the literature on CBD and one is a pathologyreport. 3,4These reports described the clinical signs and diagnosis but provided minimal information ontreatment. This report details both systemic treat-ment as well as in-depth foot care as the combina-tion appears to be necessary for improvement. As long-term corticosteroids are necessary for treat-ment, it strongly suggests CBD to be an immune-mediated disease. These horses appear to have aspecic antigen associated with the keratinized hoofwall that is involved. Pemphigus remains a possi-ble cause as it has several subtypes that could affectan antigen located in a single type of tissue. Adescending dose of prednisolone was chosen due toits good bioavailability, excellent anti-inflammatoryeffects and appears to be a minimal risk factor fordeveloping laminitis. 11Minocycline, an oral anti- biotic with good bioavailability and good tissue pen-etration, was used at the initiation of treatment forthe possibility of a low-grade infection in thecoronet. Foot care combined with the initial systemic ther- apy appears to be essential for a successful outcome.Taking the horse out of work during the initial treat-ment phase allows the feet to rest and preventstrauma to the healing tissue. Removing the shoesallows the feet to be trimmed properly, effectivelyimproves any hoof capsule distortions or abnormalhoof conformation, and leaves all the affected tissuereadily accessible for daily treatment. It appearsimportant to remove all abnormal horn and crustsfrom the coronet and bulbs to allow penetration ofthe topical medication at the skin coronet junction.The topical corticosteroid ointment or the combina-tion of anti-inflammatory ef-fect and allantoin for its astringent propertiesappear to be effective in decreasing abnormalgrowth. The affected tissue at the bulbs (and frogs)will generally be soft, void of adequate horn thick-ness, and contain multiple ssures. The use of ben-zoyl peroxide in 10% acetone as an astringent seemsto improve the horn and promote cornication.If canker is present, the frog is treated as a separate Fig. 6.

The nal, essential, and extremely important as- pect of this treatment is the commitment of theowner/caretaker to persevere through with thetreatment plan. Although the treatment is not dif-cult; it is time consuming and the treatment notonly has to be performed daily or on a frequent basisbut must be thorough, consistent, and with atten-tion to detail.

Thus, needle arthroscopy canallow practitioners to bypass the diagnostic limita-tions found in certain areas difcult to image withtraditional and advanced imaging (i.e., stifle and shoulder), to improve the diagnostic capabilities be-fore recommending surgery or advanced diagnosticsunder GA for cases with unrewarding results aftertraditional imaging (i.e., carpus, tarsus, and carpalsheath) or to perform standing arthroscopic removalof simple osteochondral fragments in standing pa-tients (i.e., dorso-proximal rst phalanx fragments). The objective of this paper is to describe how to perform standing needle arthroscopy in several sy- novial structures where its use could be benecialfor diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. In addition,the benets and limitations of the technique forevery region will be highlighted. 2. Materials and Methods The procedures were carried out with a 1.2-mm di-ameter and 65-mm long or 100-mm long (only for theshoulder joint) needle arthroscope a. This arthro- scope has a 10\u00b0 forward-viewing angle and is reus-able (5 to 8 times in general) after performing gas orcold sterilization. A custom-made splint adjustable in length and foot angle and a splint base adjustable in heightand angle were designed in collaboration with anorthotics research center to ensure stable limbflexion during arthroscopic examination of the car- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 479NEW INNOVATIONS AND TIMELY CONSIDERATIONS IN EQUINE LAMENESS AND SURGERY NOTESpus, tarsus, and carpal sheath (Fig. 1). Several segments of the splint were adjustable (verticallength, hoof piece and base angle, height andthickness of padding blocks) to accommodatelimbs of different sizes and to warrant sterilityduring the procedure. Minimal pre-operativesplint training was performed with the horses toavoid an acclimation effect. The technique and feasibility of the needle ar- throscope to arthroscopically explore wasrst assessed in cadaveric specimens. Then, 6horses without history of musculoskeletal diseasewere enrolled to validate the use of the needlearthroscope in the aforementioned synovial struc-tures except the MCP/MTP joint (clinical casesonly). The studies were approved by the localInstitutional Animal Use and Ethics Committee.For the MCP/MTP joint, horses admitted forstanding arthroscopic removal of simple osteo-chondral fragments located in the dorsal recess ofthe joint were enrolled. For the synovial structures experimentally evalu- ated, an intra-articular visualization score was at-tributed to every articular structure, with 3 forcomplete visualization, 2 for sub-complete (approxi-mately 51% to 99% of the structure visualized), 1 forpartial (approximately 1% to 50% of the structurevisualized) and 0 for no visualization.The pre-operative protocol, arthroscopic technique and post-operative care followed after horses wereintroduced in standing stocks and sedated withdetomidine and butorphanol will be described nextfor every synovial structure. During the procedure,a light plane of sedation was maintained with aconstant rate infusion (CRI) of 0.1% /H11006 butorphanol titrated as needed. Horses were ad-ministered phenylbutazone before and 8 to 12 hoursafter the procedure. To prevent urine contamina-tion of the surgical eld from males, a bag attachedto a metallic ring and held in place with a roll ofgauze around the abdomen of the horse (Fig. 2) wasplaced below the prepuce for forelimb surgeries ex-cept the SH joint and catheterized in astandard fashion for hindlimb surgeries. Formares, a plastic sheet was attached to the back ofthe stocks and placed right behind the thigh area toprevent urine spillage into the surgical eld forhindlimb surgeries. The region of interest wasclipped immediately before the procedure. Metacarpo/Tarsophalangeal Joint (Dorsal Recess) Horse position was adjusted within the stockswith a transverse bar placed either cranially(forelimb surgery) or caudally (hindlimb sur-gery) to increase the distance of the operatedlimb/s from the stocks' frame. If available, amodied stocks door as used to perform stand-ing tie-back surgery may facilitate distancingthe affected limb from the stock frame. The Fig. 1.

If unilateral hindlimb surgery was performed,a Kimzey splint bwas placed in the contralat- eral limb to prevent the horse from resting theaffected hindlimb during the procedure. Ad-ditionally, butorphanol was not used forhindlimb surgeries to further prevent limbresting. Local analgesia, limb preparation, and drapingwas similar to previously described. 8Briefly, after aseptic preparation of the fetlock region,a line block just above the dorsal (30 mL) from proximal cannonbone to mid-radius/tibia to prevent hair fromfalling into the surgical eld. Next, a sterileadhesive drape was placed around the fetlockand then the foot and kneeling mat were cov-ered with a surgical drape rst and then, by anadhesive \"U\" drape. The surgeon should kneel just laterally to theaffected limb on a soft mat or wear knee padsunless the stocks can be lifted. Additionally,the arthroscopic screen can always be placedcranially (author's preference) or alternatedbetween cranial or caudal according to location, limb affected dominanthand (Fig. 3A). A 65-mm-long needle arthroscope and a2.4-mm outer diameter cannula (regular can-nula is 2.2-mm diameter) is recommended to be able to provide enough fluid delivery afteran instrument portal is placed (Fig. 3F). Ei-ther a pressure infusion bag or a peristalticpump c(author's preference) is used to ensure joint distention during the procedure. Spe-cial attention to fluid delivery settings duringeach phase of surgery is critical to prevent fluid extravasation or joint capsule rupture if aperistaltic pump is used. A standard approach to the MCP/MTP jointwas carried out after a 3-mm skin incision withan 11# blade was performed. 14A sharp obtu- rator was used to penetrate the joint capsuleperpendicularly to the incision. At this level,cartilage is covered by the synovial plica andcannot be damaged. After joint penetration,the sharp obturator was replaced by a bluntobturator and the cannula and obturator wereadvanced into the joint in a horizontal direc-tion. Lastly, the blunt obturator was re-placed by the arthroscope and joint explorationstarted. At the end of the procedure, 250 to 500 mg ofgentamicin or amikacin were injected into thejoint. The 3-mm arthroscopic portal was leftunsutured to improve cosmetic appearanceand prevent suture removal complicationsfor that portal. Routine bandaging was per-formed for 2 weeks. At 2 weeks, sutures wereremoved from the instrument portal and handwalking was started. Fig. 3.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 481NEW INNOVATIONS AND Carpal and Radiocarpal Joints (Dorsal Recesses) The animals were placed slightly outside of the stocks to prevent interference with the stocks'frame. A lower limb bandage was placed andthen the splint was attached to the limb to beoperated on (Fig. 3B). After a rst scrub of the carpal region, a lineblock with lidocaine hydrochloride 2% of both jointswith 20 mL of hydrochloride 2%were performed. The carpus was then ster-ilely prepped and draped as follows: a sterileelastic bandage was placed proximally and dis-tally to the carpus and a sterile adhesive drapewas placed around the carpal region. After draping, the splinted limb was attachedto the splint base to achieve a carpal angle of110\u00b0 flexion, which achieved satisfactory eval-uation of both joints in cadaveric speci-mens. This step was purposely done rightbefore arthroscopic exploration to minimizethe time horses were held with their carpiflexed. The surgeon sat cranio-laterally to the limbduring the procedure and used one hand todirect the scope while the other hand was usedto held/stabilized the limb. Thus, the 360\u00b0sterile draping is recommended. Routine dorsal arthroscopic approaches to thecarpus were performed after a 3-mm skin in-cision was done. 14 During the procedure, an assistant was avail-able to hold the splinted limb as needed toreduce limb movement. Additionally, thesplint base was designed with a wide base toprevent limb rocking and also to allow thesurgeon to step on it to further prevent limbmovement (Fig. 3B). The described featuresto minimize limb movement can-nula) was used. A pressure infusion bag wasused to ensure joint distention during theprocedure. Joints were injected with 250 mg of gentamicinat the end of the procedure, incisions were leftunsutured, and limbs were routinely bandagedfor 4 to 5 days. After this period, horses re-turned to paddock turnout. Tarsocrural Joint (Dorsal Recesses and Plantarolateral Recess) Horses were placed inside the stock as far as possible from the back to prevent interferencewith the stocks' frame. A lower limb stablebandage was placed and the splint applied.As for the carpus, a regional line block just proximal intra-articular anes-thesia with 20 mL of mepivacaine hydrochlo-ride 2% diluted in 30 to 40 mL of an isotonicsolution was administered. The tarsal regionand the contralateral limb were next draped asdescribed for the carpal region. Lastly, thesplinted limb was attached to the splint basewith the tarsus flexed at 90\u00b0. The surgeon sat cranio-laterally to the limbduring the procedure and used one hand todirect the scope while the other hand held/stabilized the limb. Thus, the 360\u00b0 steriledraping (regular can-nula) was used. A pressure infusion bag wasused to ensure joint distention during theprocedure. As for the previous joints, it is recommended touse the sharp trocar rst to pierce the jointcapsule and then replace it by the blunt trocarbefore further advancing the cannula withinthe joint. This approach ensures a tight sealaround the arthroscopic cannula and mini-mizes fluid extravasation. The to the centerof the dorsolateral outpouching and the cannu-la/obturator were introduced toward the lat-eral malleolus of the tibia. The dorsomedialapproach was made between the extensor ten-don bundle and the saphenous vein to maxi-mize joint visualization and the cannula/obturator were introduced toward the medialmalleolus of the tibia. The plantarolateralapproach was made in the caudocentral to cau-doproximal aspect of the outpouching to pre-vent interference with the lateral trochlea ofthe talus (Fig. 3C). Joints were injected with 250 mg of gentamicinat the end of the procedure, incisions were leftunsutured, and limbs were routinely bandagedfor 4 to 5 days. After this period, horses re-turned to paddock turnout. Carpal Sheath (Proximolateral Recess) Horses were either placed slightly outside ofthe stocks or completely caudally to preventinterference with the stocks' frame. A lower-limb bandage was placed and the splint wasattached to the limb to be operated on (Fig.3D).

A sterile elasticbandage was placed proximally and distally tothe carpus and an adhesive drape was circum-ferentially placed around the carpal region. After draping, the splinted limb was attachedto the splint base to achieve a carpal angle of30\u00b0 from the vertical plane. The surgeon sat cranio-laterally to the limbduring the procedure and used one hand todirect the scope while the other hand was usedto hold/stabilize the limb. Thus, the 360\u00b0sterile draping is recommended. A routine tenoscopic approach through theproximolateral recess of the carpal to the radial physis) wasperformed. 14In this case, a blunt obturator was used to enter the sheath perpendicular tothe limb and then tenoscopic higher torque needed toexplore the intertendinous recess. A pressureinfusion bag was used to ensure joint disten-tion during the procedure. The sheath was injected with 250 mg of gen-tamicin at the end of the procedure. Theincision was left unsutured and the limb wasroutinely bandaged for 4 to 5 days. Afterthis period, horses returned to paddockturnout. Scapulohumeral Joint Horses were placed slightly outside of thestocks to prevent interference with the stocks'frame. After a rst scrub of the shoulder region, skinand subcutis were anesthetized using a lineblock proximal to the joint with lidocainehydrochloride 2%. Next, the SH joint wasanesthetized and distended with 20 mL ofmepivacaine hydrochloride 2% diluted in 25mL of an isotonic solution via a cranio-lateralapproach with a 18-G spinal needle. No draping was used for this joint and thesurgeon stood cranio-laterally to the limb dur-ing the procedure (Fig. 3E). A routine cranio-lateral approach to the SHjoint was performed. 14To facilitate joint en- try, the needle used for joint anesthesia anddistension was left in place and the cannulaand a blunt obturator were directed in thesame direction until entry. A long-needle arthroscope and a2.4-mm outer-diameter cannula was used inanticipation of the higher torque needed toexplore this joint. A pressure infusion bagwas used to ensure joint distention during theprocedure.The joint was injected with 250 mg of genta- micin at the end of the procedure. The incisionwas left unsutured and a sterile adhesive ban-dage was applied for 24 to 48 hours. Horseswere kept in stall rest for 2 to 3 days after theprocedure before being turned out in a smallpaddock. 3. Results Metacarpo/Tarsophalangeal Joint (Dorsal Recess) Eight females and 13 geldings, from 1.7 to 11 years of age (mean, 4.5 years; median, 4 years) of differentbreeds (12 Warmbloods, 4 Quarter Horses, 3 Stan-dardbreds, 1 Friesian, and 1 Lusitano) were oper-ated with the technique. Dorso-proximal rst phalanx fragments were found in 18 horses (24 joints, 30 fragments), frag-ments embedded in the distal aspect of the synovialplica in 2 horses (2 joints, 4 fragments) and a free-floating fragment believed to have come from thedorsal sagittal ridge of the third metatarsal bone(MT3) in one horse (1 joint). Fifteen of 21 horses(71%) were unilaterally affected and 6 (29%) bilat-erally. werearthroscopically removed from 27 joints: frontlimbs (9 right and 6 left) and 12 (44%)hindlimbs (7 right and 5 left). One solitary frag-ment was removed from 19/27 joints (71%) and 2from 8 (29%) joints. Patient preparation was approximately 60 min- utes while the surgical procedure took 15 to 20 min-utes for most patients. Joint visualization wasconsidered equivalent to performing the surgerystanding with a 4-mm arthroscope. Intra-operative complications included mild fluid extravasation in two horses and one horse urinatedat the end of hindlimb surgery despite urinary cath-eterization but did not contaminate the surgical eld. Moderate movement during the procedureleading to arthroscope exit and reintroduction wasseen in 5/21 horses but only in one after the tech-nique was rened (use of a contralateral Kimzeysplint for unilateral hindlimb surgeries and per-forming the line block just proximal to the jointrecess) after the rst 5 horses. No equipment damage occurred and the arthro- scopes were reused approximately 5 to 8 times (itwas not necessary to reuse them more than 1 to 2times for the other synovial structures in the study).None of the joints became septic and all arthroscopicincisions were macroscopically healed 2 days post-operatively. This was also the case for the othersynovial structures investigated. The following synovial structures were evaluated in 6 healthy medium-sized breed horses (4 maresand 2 geldings) with a mean age of 9 years old(range, 3-13) and mean weight of 450 kg (range,380-528). AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 483NEW Carpal and Radiocarpal Joints Arthroscopy of the RC joint was performed on all horses (3 left and 3 right forelimbs), whereas ar-throscopy of the MC (rst joint evaluated) was onlycarried out on the rst 3 horses (2 left and 1 rightforelimbs). Mild weight-bearing movements dur-ing the procedure transiently limited visualizationof the caudal aspect of the weight-bearing surface ofthe bones in the MC joint. This made thorough MCjoint evaluation time consuming, which subjectivelyaffected procedure tolerability/movement during RCarthroscopy. Thus, for the following three horses itwas decided to explore only one joint and the RCjoint was chosen. For both joints, most IA structures were com- pletely visible from the dorsolateral approaches (ra-diocarpal joint [RCj] visualizationscore: 2.75 and middle carpal joint [MCj]: 2.83)while they were mainly completely to subcompletelyvisualized the dorsomedial approaches (RCjmean dorsomedial visualization score: 2.28 andMCj: 2.12). Despite the superior scores for thedorsolateral approaches, both arthroscopic ap-proaches are recommended for a thorough jointevaluation. Mean /H11006SD times for the RCj and MCj 6.24 /H110061 minute and 9.75 /H110061.75 minute, respectively. Splint wear was well tolerated by allhorses. The procedure was considered feasiblewith only minor complications (mild hemarthrosis in1/6 and mild iatrogenic damage in 2/6) associated tothe technique other than movement. Moderatelimb movement occurred in 2 of the 3 rst horseswhere both joints were evaluated during the sameprocedure. Tarsocrural Joint A mean visualization score of 2.53 was obtained forthe dorsal arthroscopic approaches (2.69 for the dor-solateral [rst and 2.38 for thedorsomedial approach [second approach performed])while only a mean score of 1.88 was obtained forthe plantarolateral approach (third approach per-formed). The main visualization limitation for thedorsolateral approach was partial to subcompletevisualization of the medial malleolus and shortmedial collateral ligament thereby, thorough evalu-ation of the dorsal joint recesses requires both ar-throscopic approaches. The lower scores for the dorsomedial and plan- tarolateral approaches were associated with the presence of profuse hemarthrosis and therefore,limited visualization in 3/6 horses during the dor-somedial approach. The dorsomedial vascula-ture was damaged during the initial arthroscopicapproach in one horse and due to movement (can-nula exit and reintroduction) in the two otherhorses. Additionally, residual deep digital flexortendon tension prevented arthroscopic evaluationof the plantaromedial structures in one horse.No other complications were seen during the pre- operative or post-operative period. Mean /H11006SD arthroscopic time to perform minutes, and 5.06 /H110062.05 minutes, respectively. All 6 horses tolerated the splint and base during the procedure. Nonetheless, 2 horses were shorterand did not require the splint base to achieve a 90\u00b0of tarsal flexion. Carpal Sheath The procedure allowed complete visibility of mostproximal carpal sheath structures up to the carpo-metacarpal joint level. Nonetheless, visualizationof the intertendinous recess was partial in mosthorses (4/6) due to remaining flexor tendon tensionin standing horses. The splint was well toleratedby all horses (6/6) but placement of the splintedlimb on the splint base resulted in occasional drasticlimb movement during the procedure in one horse.Mean tenoscopic time was 7 /H110063 minutes. Besides the aforementioned movement in one horse, only mild complications were found: mild and transient intrathecal bleeding in 3/6 horses,mild-to-moderate fluid extravasation in 3/6 horses,and cannula accessing the tightintertendinous recess in 2/6 horses. Scapulohumeral Joint Joint distraction and limb adduction without jointcollapse is not possible in the standing horse, andtherefore it was anticipated that the medial aspectof the joint would not be visible. The joint was arthroscopically accessed on the rst attempt in all but one case (2 attempts). Theglenoid rim up to 2 cm medially, humeral head andsynovial membrane were completely visualized cen-tro-laterally in all cases and caudo-laterally in 3/6.The visualization of the most caudal aspect of thejoint was partial in three cases. Visualization ofthe cranial aspect of the glenoid rim and glenoidnotch was partial in two and three cases, respec-tively, and complete in the remaining cases. Arthroscopic evaluation took a mean time of 7 minutes (ranging from 5 to 10 minutes). Arthro-scope manipulation and maneuverability was con-sidered easy in all instances and all horses toleratedthe procedure well without any undesirable move-ments. Fluid extravasation was encountered in allcases, being mild in 5 cases and moderate in one.Mild iatrogenic cartilage damage during trocar pen-etration was seen in 2 horses; however, no lesionswere identiable when horses were euthanized 8months later for reasons unrelated to the project.

Discussion The mortality rate associated with GA has been reported to be approximately 1% in horses. Addi-tionally, other perianesthetic risks are also preva-lent and remain signicantly higher in horses thanin other species. 9Nonetheless, GA is required to perform arthroscopy and advanced imaging in mostinstances due to the size and temperament ofhorses. Moreover, traditional imaging has a lim-ited diagnostic accuracy in certain regions (i.e.,shoulder), yields a moderate diagnostic rate forcertain articular lesions and does not offer infor-mation regarding cartilage health. 4,14,15For ex- ample, radiography and in the medial malleolus (sensitivity of71% and 83%, respectively). 7,8In the carpus, some lesions such as nonmarginal osteochondral fragments, cartilage damage, and palmar intercarpalligament tearing can radiographically silent anddifcult require an expert ultra-sonographer and tenoscopy remains the goldstandard for diagnostics. 19Thus, the use of stand- ing arthroscopic techniques for diagnostic pu rposes will eliminate the risks associated with GA andmay improve the diagnostic rate before a treat-ment is pursued. Additionally, good character-ization of the lesions will provide clients with amore accurate prognosis before pursuing surgeryand will help veterinarians with surgical plan-ning. Finally, the technique could also be used asa second-look arthroscopic technique for clinical orresearch purposes.The techniques reported offered a quick, safe, and reliable diagnostic evaluation of the investigated sy-novial structures but as for other diagnostic tech-niques, they are not exempt of limitations. Generaland specic limitations and tips are discussed below. 1. Needle arthroscopy is mainly conceived for diagnostic purposes but a therapeutic usehas been shown for the dorsal compartmentof the fetlock and could also be possible forsimple osteochondral lesions in other re-gions. Nevertheless, further investigationsare needed before it can be recommended. 2. The needle arthroscope has a 10\u00b0 lens view- ing angle and the eld of view issmaller. This translates to working closerto the area of interest and having a sub-complete to partial visualization for certainstructures during specic arthroscopic ap-proaches (i.e., limited visualization of themedial malleolus of the tibia from thedorsolateral approach and of some carpalstructures from a contralateral ar-throscopic approach). To minimize thislimitation, a good arthroscopic knowledgeis mandatory before attempting the tech-nique. Also, some joints (i.e., MC, RC, andTC) will require two arthroscopic ap-proaches to obtain a thorough joint evalu-ation. Lastly, the required arthroscopeand console are specialized equipment andrequire a practice investment. 3. Fluid delivery could be a problem if an in- strument portal or intense joint lavage (i.e.,moderate hemarthrosis is present) is re-quired. This could be completely or par-tially solved by using the 2.4-mm diameter Fig. 4. Representative arthroscopic and tenoscopic images of the metacarpophalangeal joint (A), radiocarpal (B), middle carpal (C), tarsocrural (D), carpal sheath (E), scapulohumeral joints (F). AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 66 /H114082020 485NEW INNOVATIONS AND TIMELY CONSIDERATIONS EQUINE LAMENESS AND SURGERYcannula and a peristaltic pump. Addition- ally, a needle can be used to allow joint la-vage in cases of mild hemarthrosis ordarkening of the synovial fluid. This needlecan also be used to retract the synovium fromthe eld of view as required. 4. Joint distension is usually achieved at the same time that anesthetics are deliv-ered. Nevertheless, anesthetics can leakinto the subcutis by the time of the procedureand lead to suboptimal distension. In thosecases, it is recommended to redistend thejoint immediately before arthroscopic entryto minimize the possibilities of iatrogeniccartilage damage. 5. A custom-made splint and a base were de- signed to obtain the required tarsal and car-pal angle for the procedures while ensuringsterility. The current splint ts forelimbsand hindlimbs of different sizes and has aheavy and wide base to minimize horsemovement during the procedure. Unfortu-nately, the splint is not yet commerciallyavailable and performing the procedure withother commercially available splints willlikely jeopardize sterility. In contrast, theauthor anticipates that standing carpalsheath tenoscopy could be performed withcommercially available splints without risk-ing the sterility of the procedure. 6. Horse temperament should be taken into consideration before attempting the tech-nique to prevent horse, personnel, or equip-ment damage. Anxious or unbroken horsesor horses that cannot get rapidly acclimatedto splint use are not good candidates. Theresearch horses used for the experimentalarthroscopies received minimal splint train-ing before the procedures to prevent an ac-climation effect. Additionally, the behaviorwas unknown before acquiring these horsesfor the studies. 7. Despite good splint tolerance, horses may move during the procedure and limit orlengthen the procedure. Several steps canbe put in place to reduce/minimize this move-ment: 1) Appropriate sedation and analge-sia. A relatively light plane is preferred toprevent animals from resting the limb to beoperated on or being wobbly. 2) Local andintrasynovial anesthesia is mandatory. 3)Excellent arthroscopic knowledge is crucialto minimize procedure time. 4) Minimizethe time horses wear the splint base, if re-quired for the procedure, and therefore, theyare partially weight bearing on the limb. 5)Have an assistant available to hold the limbas required and step on the wide splint baseto further improve limb stability. 8. The unsutured arthroscopic portals are mac- roscopically healed around 2 days after theprocedure and no septic synovitis have beenencountered. Leaving the portals unsu-tured avoids a recheck appointment for su-ture removal, which reduces cost for clientsand improves cosmetics. Nevertheless, theuse of cyanoacrylate glue or wound closurestrips could be used if desired. 9. When the technique was used for diagnos- tic purposes, horses required a short con-valescence period (4 to 5 days maximum)before turnout was resumed. This periodis signicantly shorter than after perform-ing therapeutic arthroscopy. Neverthe-less, a therapeutic procedure may followdiagnostic needle arthroscopy in manycases. 10. No clinical cases were included for the syno- vial structures experimentally evaluatedand therefore, further investigations areneeded to determine other benets andlimitations of the technique. As clinicalcases are recruited, it will be easier to deter-mine the diagnostic accuracy of the tech-nique for the different pathologies andsynovial structures. 11. MC/MTP joint: Standing arthroscopy of the joint for for removalof simple dorsal osteochondral fragments isundoubtfully benecial for horses. How-ever, many surgeons still prefer to do thetechnique under GA due to concerns regard-ing surgeon position during the procedure,equipment damage, or familiarity with thetechnique. The reported technique is safefor horses and personnel and in case of dam-age, needle arthroscopes are signicantlycheaper than a traditional 4-mm arthro-scope. Nonetheless, equipment damage israre to occur with either arthroscope. Theauthor found that the learning curve for thetechnique was not steep and the MC/MTPjoint is likely a good starting point for sur-geons willing to initiate on standing arthros-copy. The landmarks and intra-articularstructures of the MC/MTP joint are simple toidentify for surgeons already familiar withtraditional arthroscopic techniques. 12. MC/RC joints: Horses only tolerate partial weight bearing on a forelimb for a very lim-ited time. Thus, moderate movement oc-curred in 2/3 horses when both joints wereperformed at the same time and only the RCjoint was evaluated for the remaining 3horses. It is recommended to explore onejoint at a time to minimize limb flexion timeand movement and therefore, increase pro-cedure tolerability. Nevertheless, it is un-common that both joints will need to beevaluated in clinical cases. For most clin-ical scenarios, it is recommended that bothdorsal approaches be performed for a thor- 486 2020 /H11408Vol. 66 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSNEW INNOVATIONS AND TIMELY CONSIDERATIONS IN EQUINE LAMENESS AND SURGERYough joint evaluation. This is also recom- for traditional carpal arthroscopyunder GA. 14 13. TC joint: The dorsolateral approach is safe and allowed an exhaustive evaluation of thejoint except for the medial malleolus and theshort medial collateral ligament. Thus, it ispossible to perform only this approach unlessconcerns are focused on the most medial as-pect of the joint or a thorough joint evalua-tion is desired. Profuse hemarthrosis was asignicant complication when the dorsome-dial approach was performed. This wasmostly related to reintroduction of the ar-throscope after the horse has moved (2/3horses). At this point, the dorsomedial vas-culature may have rolled under the originalincision and the surgeon inadvertentlypunctured it. Thus, critical attention isrequired while performing the original dor-somedial approach or reintroducing thecannula to avoid the saphenous vein andits branches. Alternatively, a larger inci-sion could be performed to clearly deter-mine the absence of vasculature beforecannula introduction. 14. Carpal sheath: This technique offered a thorough evaluation of the proximal sheathstructures, where pathology tends to occur,except the intertendinous recess (partialevaluation in 4/6 and complete in 2/6). Thiswas associated with residual tendon tensionduring the standing procedure, which couldpotentially be resolved by having the limbheld by an assistant while the practitonerexplores the region. Evaluation of the in-tertendionus region is important to detecttearing of the supercial digital flexor tendonaccessory ligament. Nevertheless, all cases lesion have also beentenoscopically identied medial craniome-dial to the deep digital flexor tendon and thistechnique has the potential to identify themat this location. 20 15. Scapulohumeral joint: This technique did not offers thorough a joint evaluation as ar-throscopy under GA does because it was im-possible to obtain joint distraction and limbadduction with the animal standing. None-theless, the craniolateral, centrolateral, andcaudolateral aspect of the glenoid humeral head are visible and pathologycan be identied at this level. The tech-nique described does not identify some con-ditions involving the SH joint but thesimplicity of the procedure should encouragesurgeons to use it due to its diagnostic poten-tial. The technique is very similar to per-forming an SH joint injection. Moreover,the technique could also be used as a screen-ing tool to better select surgical candidates.5. Conclusion The described techniques mainly offer an alterna-tive diagnostic tool for a subset of cases where tra-ditional imaging modalities are unrewarding or failto obtain a denitive diagnosis. Additionally, itmay be useful for horses where an accurate progno-sis is required before arthroscopic treatment underGA is pursued (cartilage evaluation and extent ofcartilage and soft-tissue damage). Lastly, the tech-nique has the potential to be used as a second-lookarthroscopic technique to monitor healing/damagein clinical and research settings. Further investi-gations are needed to determine its applicability inclinical cases as joint visualization, limb movement,and splint tolerance may be challenging in horseswith pathology.

Introduction Cyathostomins are pervasive parasites of horses. In rare cases, mass excystment of larvae can lead tolife-threatening disease. Anthelmintic treatmentcan target both the adults in the large intestineand/or the encysted larvae. Anthelmintics that are adulticidal only, such ivermectin, have been im-plicated in cyathostomin disease. However, con-cerns have been raised that killing larvae whileencysted within the mucosal walls could lead to ad-verse reactions as well. 2. Materials and Methods This study evaluated the local and systemic inflamma-tory reaction to two different macrocyclic lactones:moxidectin, which is both adulticidal and larvicidal, and ivermectin, which is adulticidal only. Briefly, 36horses were allocated into one of 3 groups: moxidec-tin treated, ivermectin treated, and an untreated con-trol group. Half the horses from each group wereeuthanized at 2 weeks posttreatment, and the otherhalf at 5 weeks posttreatment. Weekly blood sam-ples were collected throughout the study for gene ex-pression evaluation. Tissue samples were collectedfrom the cecum, ventral, and dorsal colon for histopa-thology and gene expression at the 2 and 5 weeksposttreatment. 3. Results Of the three groups, the moxidectin-treated grouphad a signicantly lower proinflammatory response, AAEP PROCEEDINGS 491NEW INNOVATIONS AND TIMELY CONSIDERATIONS IN EQUINE LAMENESS AND SURGERY Research Abstract /L50093for more information, contact the corresponding author NOTESfollowed by the ivermectin-treated group, and then the untreated controls. 4. Discussion The data suggest that removal of cyathostomins willreduce the proinflammatory response associatedwith infections. In conclusion, anthelmintic treatment was minimal,but lowest for moxidectin-treated horses. Furtherwork is needed to elucidate the exact mechanismsinvolved with the regulation of worm burdens andworm expulsion.Acknowledgments Finding Source This project was funded under 19ERGPAR-01-01 by Zoetis, LLC.
