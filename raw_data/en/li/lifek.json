Metabolic cardiology as a therapeutic strategy utilizing nutritional biochemical interventions that preserve and promote the cellular energy adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production which supports heart health and cellular energy. The heart requires a constant supply of ATP to maintain regular rhythm and pressure. D-Ribose, L-Carnitine, CoQ10, D-Ribose, Magnesium are essential nutrients to heart health. D-Ribose is a naturally occurring sugar that has been shown to support the production and recycling of ATP which helps to increase energy formation in stressed tissues. Some studies also suggest that ribose may nutritionally support heart function. DMG is a metabolic enhancer that helps the body overcome various forms of stress such as aging, poor oxygen availability, free radical damage and supports the immune system. As a methyl donor it contributes methyl groups to keep ATP levels high. CoQ10 is a free radical scavenger and a naturally occurring cofactor in cellular energy and play a vital role to the production of ATP. CoQ10 levels decline after age 35. Acetyl-L-Carnitine is a derivative of the amino acid Carnitine. It supports heart function by transporting fatty acids from the blood through to the mitochondrial membranes and into heart cells so the fatty acids can be converted into ATP. Beyond and Above Cholesterol Family history is at most 50% of your risk of chronic disease. The other 50% is lifestyle and environment. A coronary calcium score (Cardioscan) of zero is not reassuring? How about the non-calcified arterial plaque which is more likely to break off and cause a heart attack or stroke than calcified plaque? Medications that increase the Cardio Risk - amphetamines - nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) - antidepressants - birth pills - decongestants - atypical antipsychotics - systemic corticosteroids Risk factors for increased blood pressure: High sodium diet, obesity, alcohol consumption, coffee, hormone imbalance, inflammation, lack of physical activity, overweight Recommended reading - Personalized and Precision Integrative Cadiovascular Medicine by Dr. Mark C.

What is the main risk factor of Metabolic Syndrome? Overweight and obesity are the main risk factors for metabolic syndrome because they can raise \"bad\" LDL cholesterol, blood triglycerides, and blood pressure, and lower \"good\" HDL cholesterol. Overweight and obesity during pregnancy can raise your child's risk of metabolic syndrome Heart Rate Variability and Metabolic Syndrome While heart rate refers to the number of times your heart beats per minute. Heart rate variability (HRV) measures the fluctuation in the time intervals between adjacent heartbeats. This beat-to-beat interval variation is measured in milliseconds and can vary depending on a number of factors. Such minor variations tell us a lot about critical factors like your physical fitness, stress, sleep and over all metabolic syndrome. What is heart rate variability? Heart rate variability (HRV) measures the fluctuation in the time intervals between adjacent heartbeats. This beat-to-beat interval variation is measured in milliseconds and can vary depending on a number of factors. What HRV does show to you? Like smoking, diabetes and elevated lipids, low HRV is a risk factor for mortality in all patients. For several decades it has been known that low heart rate variability predicts sudden cardiac death from arrhythmias after a heart attack and that it also predicts post-heart attack survival High HRV is usually a sign that show you have low risk of Metabolic Syndrome How can we help?
