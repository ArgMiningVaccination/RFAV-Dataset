Michelle Golding, ARNP About: Our bright and shiny Michelle, and her love of healing makes her such a beautiful pillar of experience here at Mind Body Spirit Care. She has over 30 years of experience in various forms of women's health from Midwifery to Natural Bio-Identical Hormone Therapy. Michelle began her career in 1986 and ignited her appetite for healing others when she graduated with honors with her BSN in Nursing, from Western Carolina University. During her time in the Air Force Nurse Corps, she became interested in women's health and became an OB nurse, manager, and educator. In 1997, she graduated from Georgetown University with a Masters in Nursing, specializing in OB/GYN and midwifery. As a midwife, she dedicated her life listening to women, ensuring her patients made the best decisions amidst the plethora of often confusing choices for their own individualized care. Her passion for dedicating herself to listening to her clients enabled a transition into bio-identical hormone therapy, thyroid management, and adrenal health to address the many similar complaints from which her clients suffered. Most of her clients simultaneously complained of fatigue, mood swings, weight gain and hair loss, and it became her mission to help her clients ease these distresses and balance their health. So in 2011, she began studying Bio-Identical hormone replacement therapy and natural hormone pellet therapy and joined Dr. Shemesh and Mind Body Spirit Care with a desire for a comprehensive integrative medical approach to ease her clients' symptoms. Michelle also offers cosmetic procedures to help her clients look as vibrant on the outside as they feel on the inside. Michelle's clients benefit from her client empowerment with holistic knowledge on rebalancing thyroid and adrenal issues naturally with supplementation, and she also offers Botox and facial fillers such as eyebrow lifting, restoring cheek volume, and one of her personal favorites, Silk, which restores lips back to their luscious youthful state, all while still maintaining a very natural appearance. Michelle also offers a non-invasive 15-minute out-patient laser vaginal rejuvenation procedure to help women relieve symptoms including incontinence, dryness, painful intercourse and menopause. Michelle's ambition is improving her patients' quality of life, a multi-layered process. Not only is she passionate about naturally balancing or replacing hormones, slowing down the aging process, preventing disease, and patient empowerment, but she also helps her clients to look as good as they feel! We here at Mind Body Spirit Care are so happy to have a tuned-in healer like Michelle helping our medical staff assist both male and female patients to feel their best, inside and out.

Nurse Practitioner Education: - Syracuse University, BSN, 1979 - Simmons College, MSN, Primary Care 1988 - Jung Tao School of Classical Chinese Medicine, Dipl. Acupuncture 2011 About: Cathy Heideman has been a board certified nurse practitioner of adult health since 1988 and practiced allopathic primary care for years in the greater Boston area, New Mexico, Virginia and Washington, D.C. She began to realize early in her career that while our allopathic (traditional) system of medicine and illness care has much to offer, it is limited, and many patients continued to be ill after standard treatment options were exhausted. Since then she has actively pursued the addition of safe, complementary and integrative options into her practice. She studied herbalism with Rosemary Gladstar in the 1990's and continues to include supplements, herbs, and homeopathic remedies in her treatment plans. As often as possible, she follows Hippocrates' simple rule, \"Let food be thy medicine and medicine by thy food.\" Hippocrates is also credited with the quote, \"Wherever the art of medicine is loved, there is a love of humanity.\" Cathy strongly believes that is true and practices the art she loves with passion. Cathy has 12 years of experience in aesthetics including dermal fillers and neurotoxin injections (i.e. Dysport and Botox), facial PRP, and facial rejuvenation. She knows it helps people feel better when they look better. As a Nurse Practitioner, Cathy looks for the root causes of chronic diseases, including chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia. Cathlene Heideman is licensed to provide a full range of health care services for adults including ordering and interpreting diagnostic tests, diagnosing and treating acute and chronic conditions, prescribing medications, supplements, treatments, managing overall care, and educating patients on disease prevention, diet and other positive lifestyle choices.
