Or have you been in pain for quite some time due to a chronic sports injury and are ready to get back to feeling better? A sports injury session with us might just be what you need for overall wellness. Here's what you should know about integrative medicine for treating sports injuries. What are Sports Injuries? Sports injuries occur while playing a variety of sports at all levels of intensity. They can be acute or chronic in nature and can also be minor or more serious injuries that require rehabilitation or surgery. Common acute sports injuries include: - ACL knee injuries - meniscus tears - dislocations - fractures Common chronic sports injuries include: - recurring sprains - patellofemoral knee syndrome - tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis) - baseball elbow (medial epicondylitis) - sports hernias What Are the Benefits of an Integrative Approach to Sports Injuries? There are multiple benefits to undergoing integrative therapy to manage and treat both chronic and acute sports injuries. Integrative medicine is a holistic approach and aims to treat the entire body rather than just the injury. The team at One Source Integrative Medicine will meet with you to review your history and determine a plan to kickstart healing and promote recovery. The goal of an integrative approach is to: - Reduce pain and swelling - Increase range of motion - Improve strength and stamina - Prevent future injuries or re-injury What to Expect During a Sports Injury Therapy Session A trained physician or sports medicine specialist at One Source Integrative Medicine will begin by asking a detailed set of health questions to determine your current health, including symptoms and severity of the injury along with other contributing factors. From there, the most appropriate treatment plan will be developed for you. The treatment plan will include a series of sessions over several weeks and it may take a few sessions before you experience a change in wellness.
