At UPMC, your bariatric surgeon and a dietitian will work with you to develop an individualized plan that meets your [unique nutritional needs](/services/bariatrics/surgery-process/post-surgery/diet). The recommendations will differ depending on the procedure you undergo. Vitamins After Bariatric Surgery Your post-surgery bariatric vitamin and mineral supplements are available without a prescription. They are recommended to be chewable or liquid initially, but you will likely be able to take them in pill-form over time. Post-surgery bariatric multivitamins (containing minerals) No matter which bariatric procedure you undergo, you can expect to consume less food following your surgery. This makes it difficult to meet your nutrient needs each day, and puts you at risk for nutritional deficiencies. Complete bariatric multivitamins simply contain a combination of vitamins and minerals that make it easier to fill in your nutritional gaps. Calcium The mineral calcium is critical for bones, muscles and nerves function. Your calcium supplement will typically come in the form of calcium citrate or calcium carbonate. Vitamin B12 Commonly used to combat memory loss, Vitamin B12 also strengthens the immune system and bolsters energy levels. Some bariatric procedures make it more difficult for the stomach to properly release B12 during food digestion, so a B12 vitamin is recommended following surgery. Other Bariatric Vitamins Your vitamin regimen following your bariatric surgery is based on: - The type of procedure you undergo. - The result of your nutritional lab work. - Other specific health needs and concerns you may have.
