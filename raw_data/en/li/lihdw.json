We aimed to determine the 12- month period prevalence and nature of AT use among paediatric patients and paren t perceptions of AT use. Methods We undertook a cross -sectional survey of a convenie nce sample of parents of paediatric patients in three ED s in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia (January -June, 2015) . Parents were invited to complete a validated, anonymous, s elf-administered questionnaire . The main outcom es were AT use by the patient and parent perceptions of AT. Results 806 parent s were enrolled. In the previous 12 months, 393 (48.8%) patients had receiv ed at least one AT. There were no gender or ethnicity differences between AT users and non- users. AT use was more common among older patients (p<0.05). Patients with chronic illness tended to use more AT (p=0.12). 1091 courses of 43 different AT had been provi ded. The most common were massage (16% of patients), chiropractic therapy (9.8%), relaxation (7.2%), meditation (6.2%) and a romatherapy (6.1%). ATs were generally used for musculoskeletal problems, health maintenance, stress and anxiety. Parents who a rranged the ATs were significantly more likely to report that ATs are safe, prevent and treat illness, assist prescription medicines, and offer a more holistic approach to healthcare (p<0.001).

Complementary medicines ar e widely used among paediatric populations although both definitions and period prevalence vary. 2-5 One recent Australian study reported a 43% 12- month period prevalence of use of complementary medicines for paediatric emergency department (ED ) patients .5 Although there is no standardized definition for AT, the National Centre for Comple mentary and Integrative Health defines AT domains as 'whole systems' (e.g. naturopathy, homeopathy); (e.g. hypnosis, biofeedback). 1 Unlike complementary medicine use, there is a paucity of literature on AT use . This study aimed to determine the period prevalence and nature of AT use among paediatric ED patients, the patient demographics associated with AT use, and the percepti ons of the parents regarding AT use and safety . This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. 4 METHODS We conducted a cross -sectional survey of the parents of paediatric patients in the EDs of two tertiary and one secondary paediatric care centres in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia (annual paediat ric census 17,000- 82,000) , between January 2015 and June 2015. Ethics committee approval was obtained at each centre. We enrolled a convenience sample of parents during periods whe n inves tigators were available (mostly 09:00 -20:00). Parents were suitable for inclusion if their child was aged d 18 years . They were excluded if they were upset, distracted or anxious , or were unable to read and/or complete the study questionnaire. Participa tion was voluntary and anonymous. Whether completed or not, the parent was asked to deposit the qu estionnaire into a sealed box. Completion of the questionnaire was deemed as implied consent . The questionnaire was the sole source of data. It was based on a questionnaire that was validated and employed in a paediatric complementary medicine study. 5 Minor revisions ensured its suitability for this AT study. The cover page defined AT and gave examples. Data were collected on the child's demographics and current prescribed medication. Indigenous status was not collected. A list of 40 commonly used AT wa s presented and the parent was asked to report if any had been administered that day, in the previous week, or the previous 12 months. Details of unlisted AT s admin istered were also requested. Alternative Therapy 'users' / 'non - users' were patients who had/ had not had a course of AT in the previous 12 months , This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. 5 respectively. Any patient who regularly (daily or intermittently for symptom control) required prescribed medication (e.g. salbutamol) was defined as having a chronic disease. Data on general percepti ons of AT were also collected. Six separate statements were provided e.g. 'Alternative Therapies can prevent children from becoming ill'. For each statement, the parent was asked to record their agreement on a 5 -point L ikert scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree). To demonstrate a cli nically significant difference between relevant patient subgroups (e.g. males versus females) in AT use of 5% versus 15%, at least 160 patients w ere need ed in each subgroup ( alpha 0.05, 2- sided, power 0.80). We aimed to enrol at least 800 patients in the expectation that any one of five patient subgroups would have approximately 160 patients. Data analysis was largely descriptive. The Chi square test was employed to determine variables associated with AT use and to comp are item responses. SPSS for Windows statistical software (version 21.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA) was used for all analyses ( alpha 0.05). This article is protected by copyright.

The mean (SD) patient age was 6.7 (5.1) years, 427 (53.3%) were male, 448 (57.4%) had Australian/New Zealand/British ethnicity, and 184 (22.8%) had a chronic disease (Table 1) . On the day of presentation, in the previ ous week, and in the previous 12 months, 45 (5.6%, 95% CI 4.1, 7.5), 150 (18.6%, 95% CI 16.0, 21.5) and 393 (48.8%, 95% CI 45.3, 52.3) patients had received a course of AT, respectively. Older children were significantly more likely to be AT users (p=0.03) . There was no gender or ethnic group difference between AT users and non- users. Patients with chronic illness tended to use more AT (p=0.12) (Table 1). A total of 1091 courses of AT had been provided in the previous 12 months. These comprised 43 different AT, including all 40 listed in the questionnaire and 3 not listed (kinesiology 9 courses, salt therapy 3, myotherapy 2). The most common ly AT used were massage, chiropractic therapy, relaxation techniques, meditation and aromatherapy (Table 2). One child had a total of 18 different AT within the previous year. Two hundred and thirty three parents (60% of AT users) reported details of the 350 AT courses administered within the previous 12 months (Table 2 ). AT were used most commonly for musculoskeletal s oreness, stiffness, pain and injury (massage, This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. 7 chiropractic therapy, osteopathic manipulation), general health maintenance and wellbeing (chiropractic therapy, meditation, yoga, osteopathic manipulation, naturopathy, Chinese traditional medicine), upper res piratory tract infections including colds, flu and cough (aromatherapy, naturopathy, homeopathy, Chinese traditional medicine) stress relief and relaxation (relaxation techniques, meditation, aromatherapy, yoga, arts therapy) as well as physical alignment and adjustment (chiropractic therapy, osteopathic manipulation). Specific diseases for which AT were used included ga strointestinal disease (C oeliac and Crohn's disease) , atopic disease (eczema, asthma and allergic rhinitis ) as wel l as cerebral palsy, auti sm, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder s. Table 3 describes AT use as a function of age. Overall, mind -body medicine courses were used most often . However, mind- body medicine was uncommon in the 0- 2 year age group. Manipulative and body based practices were also common, including within the 0 -2 year age group. AT use (AT courses/child) fo r children aged 12- 18 years was highest except for whole medical systems. Only nine cases of adverse effects (AEs) associated with AT use were reported: yoga (2 cases), play therapy (1), osteopathic manipulation (1), massage (1), craniosacral manipulation (1), hypnotherapy (1) chiropractic therapy (1) and aromatherapy (1). Details of the AEs were not reported except for one child who experienced increased anxie ty following hypnotherapy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. 8 The use of AT had not been recommended by a third party in 121 cases. In other cases, the AT had been recommended by a friend/relative (81 cases), a doctor (42), an alternative therapist (33) and other s. In 130 cases, the AT use was not disclosed to other individuals. However, the family doctor was aware of the AT use in 122 cases. Of those wh o had used an AT within the previous week, 21(20%) parents had informed the ED doctor. For tho se who had not informed the ED doctor, rea sons for this were that the doctor did not ask (40 cases), AT were harmless (22), the doctor did not need to know (8) and the doctor would disapprove (1). Overall, 494 (61.4%, 95%CI 57.9, 64.7) parents agreed/strongly agreed that AT can be used to assist prescription medicines, 409 (50.8%, 95% CI 47.3, 54.3) that AT could treat illness, 383 (47.7%, 95%CI 44.2, 51.2) that AT are safe, 293 (36.4%, 95% CI 33.0, 39.8) that AT could prevent illness and 256 (32.0%, 95%CI 28.8, 35.4) that AT offered a more holist ic approach to health (Table 4) . For each of these items, t he perceptions of parents of AT users differed significantly from parents of non- users (p<0.001). In addition, 87 (10.8% , 95% CI 8.8, 13.2) parents agreed/strongly agreed that AT were more effectiv e than prescription medicines. For this item, the perceptions of parents of AT users and non- users did not differ . This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. 9 DISCUSSION The use of AT i s common and a wide range of AT are used . Indications of AT prevalence can be gleaned from CAM studies which report 12 month period prevalence of 'non- medicinal' CAM or 'CAM practices' that range between 12% to 23%.2,3,6 However, our 12 month period prevalence is considerably in excess of these earlier reports . Alternative therapy use is likely to vary with the study setting and sample population. As patients with chronic illnes s tended to use more AT , it is possible that AT prevalence may be higher in other hospital settings . This is the case for CAM, with high CAM prevalence reported in paediatric oncology (6% -91%) 7, epilepsy (22.6% - 95%)8-10 and cerebral palsy (56%)11. The differences between our AT prevalence and those of other reports are difficult to explain. D efinitions of AT and CAM are often confused or used interchangeably. Differing study met hodologi es is also likely to affect the results. Although m ost reports have i ncluded AT as a subgroup of CAM, we defined and targeted AT specifically. Finally, it is possible that AT use has increased in recent years. The most common ATs were massage, chiropract ic therapy, relaxation techniques, meditation and aromatherapy. These findings are consistent with other reports . Adam et al. 6 reported that the more common 'CAM practices' or AT include d massage, faith healing, chiropractic therapy, aromatherapy and relaxation. It has been reported that children account for 14% of visits to chiropractors, a proportion very similar to This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. 10 ours.12,13 Dieter et al.14 reported that massage therapy is used routinely in neonatal Intensive Care Units in preterm infants. Other common AT, including natu ropathy, osteopathy, homeopathy and acupuncture , have been reported previously .3,4,15,16 Homeopathy is used in 2- 10% of children to treat simple respiratory conditions as well as ear, nose and throat conditions.13,17 Zuzak et al.18 report ed that 45% of Swiss paediatric ED patients used homeopathy. The main reasons for AT use included musculoskeletal problems, health maintenance, and relief of stress and anxiety. S imilar reasons for CAM use have been reporte d including m usculoskeletal, ps ychological and infectious disease4, physical stabilization, relaxation16, general health maintenance, upper respiratory symptoms and eczema3, and gastrointestinal disease19. However, as with AT and CAM use prevalence, the reasons for AT and CAM use cannot be c ompared directly. In this study, older children were more likely to be an AT user . This is similar to the findings of a number of CAM studies . Adams et al. 6 reported that, for every 5 year increase in age, the odds of CAM use increased by 1.4. Lim et al.3 and Taylor et al.5 found CAM use to be higher among those above 2 years of age . The finding that ethnicity and gender are not associated with AT use is consistent with those of CAM studies.2,3,16 Patients with a chronic illness tended to have greater AT use. To date, no reports have specifically examined this association and the findings of CAM studies have been mixed. Gottschling et al. 16 reported comparable usage between healthy children and those with chronic conditions . While Hughes and Wingar d20 associated CAM use This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. 11 with children in good health, Adams et al.6 asso ciated CAM use with poor health. Taylor et al.5 reported that CAM use was significantly greater among patients who had a chronic disease. Given the popularity of AT and their potential cost, there is a need for better evidence of the ir efficacy and safety . Hunt et al.21 revealed a benefit for acupuncture in post - operative nausea and vomiting, hypnosis in procedure related pain, and massage therapy for the growth and development of prete rm infants and sleep. However, the majority of studies they examined show ed weak or no evidence of AT efficacy and many were limited by their methodology. Posadzki et al.22 report ed that osteopathic manipulation had no effect on a number of conditions incl uding asthma and cerebral palsy. Although some trials had shown AT to be effective in infanti le colic and postural asymmetry , these trials also had poor methodology. Despite this lack of evidence, osteopathic manipulation was, in fact, used for cerebral palsy and postural asymmetry in our study. Adverse events have been reported following AT use . Adams et al. 6 reported 80 AE s associated with CAM, including a number associated with AT. Although our study was not des igned to assess the safety of AT s, adverse effects were associated with a range of AT . However, these AEs were self -assessed and not further specified. Parent knowledge of AT efficacy and safety was generally poor. Many parents viewed AT as a suitable method to both prevent and treat illness, an d viewed AT as safe. There are similar reports of pe rceptions of CAM. Adams et al. 6 reported that 76.2% of parents believe d that AT were healthy, a finding consistent with other This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. 12 studies.15,16 It has been reported that 75% and 61% of parents of children wit h epilepsy10 and otolaryngological conditions23, respectively, believe that CAM are effective. Parental perceptions of safety are not as widely known, although one study showed that 75% of CAM users believed that C AM induced no AEs .4 In our study, the clear differences in perceptions of AT between parents of AT users and non -users were expected and consistent with one CAM study.5 Hurvitz et al.11 also reported greater AT/CAM use and positive perceptions when the par ents used these therapies themselves. The high prevalence of AT use and positive AT perceptions have implications for medical practice. T he use of AT on the day of presentation and in the preceding week was substantial . Concurrent treatment regimens may impact upon efficacy, safety and management compliance. As AT use is infrequently disclosed to the ED doctor, this information should be deliberately sought. This may inform management decisions and patient education . Patient education needs to be informed and non- judgmental .24 Accordingly, suitable reference resources should be available and accessed . This study has a number of lim itations . Non -participation and t he exclusion of non- English speakers may have introduced selection bias . Participation may h ave been affected by parental perceptions of AT, including a belief that the doctor may disapprove of their use. With the self -administ ration of the questionnaire, the characteristics of non -respondents are not known. However, the response rate was high an d substantial selection bias is unlikely.

Hence , details of the reasons for the AT use and AEs are incomplete. R ecall bias may have affected the results . There may have been bias towards the 40 AT listed in the questionnaire with under -reporting of those not listed. The participating EDs are likely to have paediatric populations representative of child ren in multi- cultural Melbou rne. However, there may have been an over - representation of children with chronic disease as some of the EDs were within major paediatric centres. This article is protected by copyright.

The most commo nly used AT include massage, chiropractic therapy, relaxation techniques, meditation and aromatherapy. Alternative therapy use i s associated with older age but no other demographic characteristics . The perceptions of the parents of AT users and non- users differed significantly with the parents of users being significantly more favorable to AT use . As AT use is rarely reported to ED physicians, they should seek this information in order to provide the most informed management strategies. This article is protected by copyright.
