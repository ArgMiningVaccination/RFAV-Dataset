Archaeologists have found remnants of plants that were used for medicinal purposes that date back to the paleolithic age, more than 60,000 years ago. During this time roots, fungi, flowers and plants were used to treat common ailments, including constipation and wound infections. Over time, humans began to document the natural healing properties of various herbs and foliage, leading to a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of how these resources could be of benefit. One amazing example of this is the Papyrus Ebers, an ancient Egyptian document that contains medicinal information on more than 850 plants, including aloe, garlic, and coriander. Today, herbalism is a thriving international enterprise. In fact, experts estimate the global herbal medicine market will be worth $111 billion by the year 2023.
