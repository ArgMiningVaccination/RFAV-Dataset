In fact, the liver is needed to help flush out toxins and support immune function, metabolism, digestion and more. Many popular supplements claim to help enhance the liver's ability to detoxify the body\u2014but does scientific evidence support such claims, and are these products even safe? In this article, we take a look at the purported benefits of liver detox supplements, along with the potential risks and safety concerns. Plus, we explore a few other expert-recommended ingredients that may be beneficial for maintaining liver health. What Are Liver Detox Supplements? Many liver detox supplements on the market claim to help enhance the function of your liver, which plays a key role in [detoxification](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/how-to-detox-safely/), along with several other aspects of health. Some of these products contain a blend of botanical ingredients formulated to promote liver health, along with various vitamins and minerals. Common ingredients in liver detox supplements may include: - Milk thistle - Artichoke extract - Turmeric - Dandelion root powder - Chicory extract - Burdock extract However, although the term \"liver detoxification\" is often used in alternative medicine and marketing, it doesn't have a clear definition, according to Saurabh Sethi, M.D., a board-certified gastroenterologist and hepatologist in Fremont, California. Still, while no specific supplement can guarantee liver health, some ingredients might be beneficial for supporting liver function, he adds. Do Liver Detox Supplements Work? \"The liver is a remarkable organ that naturally detoxifies the body by filtering toxins and metabolizing substances,\" says Sam Schleiger, a Milwaukee-based functional medicine dietitian. \"Naturally, the liver performs this function efficiently without the need for additional supplements.\" While Schleiger points out that supplements may not be necessary for maintaining a healthy liver, she adds that they might offer some benefits. \"Supporting the liver through a quality diet and specific supplements has been shown to support liver health,\" says Schleiger. \"Common liver detoxification supportive supplements contain ingredients that have potential health benefits, such as milk thistle, turmeric or artichoke extract.\" Benefits of Liver Detox Supplements Some liver supplements claim to offer a wide range of health benefits. A few of the purported benefits of liver supplements, according to the companies that offer them, include: - Enhanced bile production - Optimized metabolism - Enhanced detoxification - Support for liver regeneration - Support for liver cell function Dr. Sethi notes that not all of these benefits are backed by science. \"While certain supplements may claim to support liver health, there isn't sufficient scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of specific liver detox supplements in enhancing the liver's natural detoxification processes,\" says Dr. Sethi. Additionally, while some specific herbs and nutrients may be beneficial for certain aspects of liver health, keep in mind that not all liver detox supplements contain the same set of ingredients. Therefore, it's best to choose a high-quality product with clinically-studied ingredients to maximize the potential liver-boosting benefits. Liver Detox Supplement Side Effects Like most other supplements and medications, liver detox supplements can have some adverse side effects and risks. For starters, the quality of liver supplements can vary quite a bit, says Schleiger, and some products may contain undisclosed ingredients or contaminants that can negatively affect health. Some supplements might also interact with certain medications and increase or decrease their effectiveness, she adds, noting that certain ingredients could trigger allergic reactions. She recommends checking the label of supplements if you have any allergies. Specific ingredients in supplements could also cause side effects. For example, dandelion (a common ingredient in liver supplements) may cause [heartburn](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/acid-reflux/heartburn-treatment-prevention/), stomach pain, diarrhea and skin rash. Other herbs used in these supplements, such as milk thistle, can lower blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes and cause digestive issues. Are Liver Detox Supplements Safe? \"The safety and side effects of liver detox supplements can vary depending on the specific product and ingredients used,\" says Dr. Sethi. He adds that certain liver detox protocols or extreme fasting methods can also be harmful to health, and may cause issues like electrolyte imbalances or nutritional deficiencies. Plus, some supplements may do more harm than good by causing drug-induced injury to the liver. Instead of relying on supplements to keep your liver healthy, making a few changes to your diet and lifestyle might be more beneficial. Some of the ways that you can maintain liver health and protect against liver disease include: - Maintain a [healthy body weight](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/how-to-lose-weight-fast/)by staying active and following a balanced diet. - Avoid activities that can put the liver at risk for harm and certain diseases (such as hepatitis), including illicit drug use or unprotected sex with multiple partners. - Get screened regularly if you're at risk for liver disease. 4 Vitamins and Minerals for Liver Health Though there isn't much research to back up the benefits of liver detox supplements, there are several vitamins, minerals and herbal ingredients that some research suggests may support liver health. Read on for a few ingredients recommended by experts. Vitamin E \" [[Vitamin E]](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/vitamin-e-benefits/) is an antioxidant that may help protect liver cells from oxidative stress,\" explains Dr. Sethi. Some research shows that it might also be beneficial for liver function. In fact, one review found that vitamin E could improve liver enzymes in people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [[1]](#footnote_1). However, Dr. Sethi also points out consuming high amounts of vitamin E can actually be harmful, and advises against relying solely on supplements alone to meet your needs. Milk Thistle \"Milk thistle, specifically its active compound called silymarin, is one of the most well-known supplements for liver health,\" says Schleiger. She notes that it has antioxidant and [anti-inflammatory](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/anti-inflammatory-supplements/) properties, which may support the function of the liver. In fact, Schleiger says, milk thistle is sometimes used as a complementary treatment for liver conditions like cirrhosis and hepatitis. According to one review of eight studies, silymarin (derived from milk thistle) improved liver enzyme levels effectively in people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [[2]](#footnote_2). Turmeric Curcumin, the active compound in [turmeric](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/turmeric-health-benefits/), may have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and could have a protective effect on the liver, according to Dr. Sethi. One review of four studies reported that high doses of curcumin or turmeric could improve liver enzyme levels in people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease after eight weeks [[3]](#footnote_3). What's more, other research suggests that [curcumin](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/best-turmeric-supplements/) can support liver health by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress [[4]](#footnote_4). N-acetylcysteine [N-acetylcysteine (NAC)](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/what-is-nac/) is a precursor to glutathione, which is an antioxidant involved in liver detoxification. \"NAC has been studied for its potential in treating liver toxicity caused by substances like acetaminophen (paracetamol) overdose,\" says Schleiger. For instance, one 2022 review found that NAC may actually improve survival rates and reduce damage to the liver caused by acetaminophen overdose [[5]](#footnote_5). When to See a Doctor If liver function is a concern, it's a good idea to consult with a doctor or dietitian before turning to supplements. This is especially important if you have any underlying health concerns or are taking other medications, as some supplements may not be recommended. According to Dr. Sethi, a health care professional can provide personalized guidance and advice based on your specific situation.
