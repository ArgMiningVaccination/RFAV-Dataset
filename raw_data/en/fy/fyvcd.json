Naturopathic medicine is a system of primary healthcare that blends modern scientific knowledge with traditional and natural forms of medicine. It emphasizes the use of natural modalities\u2014such as nutrition, lifestyle counseling and botanical medicine\u2014to promote wellness and treat illness. Naturopathic doctors (NDs) work according to a set of basic principles\u2014the [Principles of Naturopathic Medicine](https://cnme.org/naturopathic-medicine-an-overview/#principles)\u2014that include such things as stimulating the healing power of the body and addressing the underlying causes of disease, rather than focusing on alleviating symptoms. The practice of naturopathic medicine requires understanding illness within the context of a person's whole life. The naturopathic approach to healthcare also emphasizes patient education and self-care. Naturopathic medicine can be used in conjunction with conventional medical therapies to support the body's healing processes\u2014an approach referred to as \"integrative medicine.\" In some clinics and hospitals, NDs work in collaboration with MDs, DCs, DOs, acupuncturists, and other healthcare practitioners, and they refer patients for emergency and other situations when necessary. While NDs primarily use natural healing approaches, they are also trained to perform minor surgeries, such as removing cysts or suturing superficial wounds, as well as to utilize prescription drugs under certain circumstances. Conditions Treated by Naturopathic Doctors Naturopathic doctors (NDs) provide individual and family primary healthcare, and treat a wide range of chronic and acute ailments. Chronic conditions treated by NDs include: - allergies - chronic pain - digestive issues - hormonal imbalances - obesity - respiratory conditions - heart disease - fertility problems - menopause - stress-related conditions - cancer - fibromyalgia - chronic fatigue syndrome - diabetes - high blood pressure - mental health concerns (e.g., depression, anxiety) - headaches - neurodegenerative conditions - autoimmune conditions (e.g., thyroid disease, lupus) - autism and ADHD - chronic skin conditions - chronic infections Acute conditions treated by NDs include: - infections (e.g., ear infections) - influenza - strep throat - skin rashes - diarrhea - urinary tract infections - hepatitis - musculoskeletal conditions and injuries Principles of Naturopathic Medicine Naturopathic medicine is distinguished by a set of core principles that underlie and determine every aspect of its practice. First Do No Harm Utilize the most natural, least invasive and least toxic therapies. Identify and Treat the Causes Look beyond symptoms to the underlying cause. The Healing Power of Nature Trust in the body's inherent ability to heal itself. Doctor as Teacher Educate patients in the steps to achieve and maintain health. Treat the Whole Person View the body as an integrated whole in all its physical, psychological and spiritual dimensions. Prevention Focus on overall health, wellness and disease prevention.
