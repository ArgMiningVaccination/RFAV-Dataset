Msg frequency varies. Msg & data rates may apply. Top Frequently Asked Questions [Am I allowed to carry my CPAP machine onboard the plane, do I have to remove it from my carry-on?](#quickset-customer_service_sub_disabilitie_0) A nebulizer, CPAP, BiPAP and APAP must be removed from its carrying case and undergo X-ray screening. Facemasks and tubing may remain in the case. You may provide a clear plastic bag to place the device through the X-ray. [I am traveling with medication, are there any requirements I should be aware of?](#quickset-customer_service_sub_disabilitie_1) All passenger items must undergo security screening. It is recommended that medication be clearly labeled to facilitate the screening process. You may bring medically necessary liquids, medications and creams in excess of 3.4 ounces or 100 milliliters in your carry-on bag. Remove them from your carry-on bag to be screened separately from the rest of your belongings. [I have a service animal, what type of screening should I expect?](#quickset-customer_service_sub_disabilitie_2) You and your service dog/animal will be screened by a walk-through metal detector. You may walk through together or you may lead the animal through separately on a leash. If you opt not to be screened by the Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT), or a walk-through metal detector (WTMD), you will undergo a pat-down. If the metal detector alarms, you and your service dog/animal will undergo additional screening, including a pat-down. During the additional screening, do not make contact with the dog/animal (other than holding the leash) until a TSA officer has completed inspection of your dog/animal. TSA will not separate you from your service animal. If you have concerns about your screening, you can ask to speak with a supervisor or passenger support specialist at any point during the process. Service dog/animal collars, harnesses, leashes, backpacks, vests and other items are subject to security screening. Items that are necessary to maintain control of the service dog/animal or indicate that the service dog/animal is on duty do not require removal to be screened. If you need to relieve your service dog and must exit the security checkpoint, you and the service dog will need to go through the screening process again. You may request to move to the front of the line upon your return. [Medication](/travel/special-procedures) for service animals must go through X-ray or inspection screening. Please separate medications and inform the TSA officer that you carry these items for your service dog. [I need special assistance during screening, whom can I contact before arriving to the airport?](#quickset-customer_service_sub_disabilitie_3) TSA Cares is a helpline that provides travelers with disabilities, medical conditions and other special circumstances additional assistance during the security screening process. Contact us 72 hours prior to traveling with questions about screening policies, procedures and what to expect at the security checkpoint. You may call [(855) 787-2227](tel:+18557872227) or [submit an online form](/contact/contact-forms). [What are the procedures if I have an internal or external medical device, such as a pacemaker or metal implant?](#quickset-customer_service_sub_disabilitie_4) Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) can facilitate your screening and reduces the likelihood of a pat-down. Inform the TSA officer that you have an artificial knee, hip, other metal implant or a pacemaker, defibrillator or other internal medical device. You should not be screened by a walk-through metal detector if you have an internal medical device such as a pacemaker. Consult with your physician prior to flying. If you choose to not be screened through the Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT), or a walk-through metal detector (WTMD), you will undergo a pat-down screening. [Face Masks](#quickset-customer_service_sub_disabilitie_5) TSA has made provisions for those that cannot safely wear a mask. Travelers under the age of 2 years old, those with a disability who cannot wear a mask, or cannot safely wear a mask for reasons related to a disability as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act, and those for whom a mask would create a risk to workplace health, safety, or job duty as determined by relevant workplace safety guidelines or federal regulations are exempt from the face mask requirement. Passed by Congress in 2005, the REAL ID Act established minimum security standards for state-issued driver's licenses and identification cards and prohibits federal agencies, like TSA, from accepting licenses and identification cards for official purposes from states that do not meet these standards. Learn about [REAL ID](https://www.dhs.gov/real-id-enforcement-brief) or [read the FAQ](https://www.dhs.gov/real-id-frequently-asked-questions).

How do I file a claim?](#quickset-customer_service_sub_lost_or_dam_1) You may [file a claim](/travel/passenger-support/claims) if you are injured or your property is lost or damaged during the screening process. Screening at certain airports is performed by private companies and not TSA. [What information should I provide on the claim?](#quickset-customer_service_sub_lost_or_dam_2) Provide as much detail as possible including receipts, appraisals and flight information to avoid delays. Contact your airline for lost or missing baggage. [What is the status of my claim?](#quickset-customer_service_sub_lost_or_dam_3) Please allow up to six months to fully investigate your claim.

[May I pack food in my carry-on or checked bag?](#quickset-customer_service_sub_permitted_a_2) Yes, you may pack food in your carry-on or checked bag, but remember all food must undergo x-ray screening. Foods that are liquids, gels, or aerosols must comply with the [3-1-1 liquids rule](/travel/security-screening/liquids-rule). TSA officers make the final decision on whether certain items are permitted into the secured areas of the airport. [What is the 3-1-1 liquids rule?](#quickset-customer_service_sub_permitted_a_3) Each passenger may carry liquids, gels and aerosols in travel-size containers that are 3.4 ounces or100 milliliters. Each passenger is limited to one quart-size bag of liquids, gels and aerosols.

[What happens if TSA determines I am traveling with an item that is deemed hazardous material?](#quickset-customer_service_sub_permitted_a_4) If hazardous materials are found in a passenger's checked baggage, those items are brought to the attention of the airline with which the passenger is booked. Once the airline determines whether the item is permitted or prohibited, TSA officers accept the airline's determination. [What is the policy on powders? Are they allowed?](#quickset-customer_service_sub_permitted_a_5) Starting June 30, 2018, if you are traveling from an international last-point-of-departure to the U.S., powder-based substances in carry-on baggage greater than 350mL or 12 oz. may require additional screening at the central checkpoint. Powder-like substances over 12 oz. or 350mL in carry-on that cannot be resolved at the central checkpoint will not be allowed onto the cabin of the aircraft and will be disposed of. For your convenience, place powders in your checked bag. The measures have already been implemented at U.S. airports nationwide to identify and prevent potentially dangerous items from being brought aboard the aircraft. There are no changes to what is allowed in carry-on baggage at U.S. airport checkpoints. [How do I apply for TSA PreCheck\u00ae?](#quickset-customer_service_sub_tsa_pre_r__0) Visit [tsa.gov/precheck](/precheck) to select the enrollment provider that best meets your needs and has an enrollment location near you. You can pre-enroll online and make an appointment for the in-person process, or walk-in to an enrollment center without an appointment. The online application takes five minutes to complete with the in-person visit taking 10 minutes. During the in-person process, the enrollment provider will collect your biometric data (fingerprints, photo), verify identity documents, and collect payment. Any website that claims to allow consumers to register for TSA PreCheck that does not end in \".gov\" is not an official TSA PreCheck website. Consumers who are applying for TSA PreCheck for the first time cannot pay the application fee online, they must complete their application and pay in-person at a TSA enrollment center. First time applicants are not asked to provide payment information online. Before you apply, we recommend that you review the various DHS trusted traveler programs: TSA PreCheck\u00ae Application Program, Global Entry, NEXUS, or SENTRI, to ensure you meet the eligibility requirements and [determine the best program](https://ttp.cbp.dhs.gov) for you.
