This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINA L PRODUCT Vaxzevria suspension for injection COVID -19Vaccine (ChAdOx1 -S [recombinant]) 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION These are multidose vials which contain 8 doses or 10 doses of 0.5 ml per vial (see section 6.5). One dose (0.5 ml) contains: Chimpanzee Adenovirus encoding the SARS -CoV-2 in genetically modified human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and by recombinant DNA technology . This product contains genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Excipient with known effect Each dose (0.5ml) contains approximately 2 mg of ethanol. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Suspension for injection (injection) . The suspension is colourless to slightly brown , clear to slightly opaque with a pH of 6.6. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Vaxzevria is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID -19 caused by SARS -CoV-2, in individuals 18 years of age and older. The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 34.2 Posology and method of administration Posology Individuals 18 years of age and older The Vaxzevria primary vaccination course consists of two separate doses of 0.5 mleach.The second dose should be administered between 4 and 12 weeks (28 to 84 days) after the first dose (see section 5.1). A booster dose (third dose) of 0.5 mlmay be given to individuals who completed the primary vaccination course with Vaxzevria or anmRNA COVID -19 vaccine (see sections 4.8 and 5.1) . The thirddose should be administered at least 3months after completing the primary vaccination course. Elderly population No dose adjustment is required . See also sectio n5.1. Paediatric population The safety and efficacy of Vaxzevria in children and adolescents ( less than 18years of age ) have not yet been established. No data are available. Method of administration Vaxzevria is for intramuscular injection only, preferably in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm . Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally. The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccin e, see section 4.4. For instructions on handling and disposal , see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Individuals who have experienced thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) following vaccination with Vaxzevria (see section 4.4). Individuals who have previously experienced episodes of capillary leak syndrome (see also section 4.4). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded . Hypersensitivity and ana phylaxis Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. An additional dose of the vaccine sho uld not be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis to a previous dose of Vaxzevria .4Anxiety -related reactions Anxiety -related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress -related reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. Concurrent illness Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from an acute severe febrile illness or acute infection . However, the presence of a minor infection and/or low -grade fever should not delay vaccination. Coagulation disorders Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome :Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) , in some cases accompanied by bleeding, has been observed very rarely following vaccination with Vaxzevria . This includes severe cases presenting as venous thrombosis, including unusual sites such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, splanchnic vein thrombosis, as well as arterial thrombosis, concomitant with thrombocytopenia. Some cases had a fatal outcome. The majority of these cases occurred within the first three weeks following vaccination. The reporting rates after the second dose are lower comp ared to after the first dose. See also section 4.3. TTS requires specialised clinical management. Healthcare professionals should consult applicable guida nce and/or consult specialists (e.g., haematologists, specialists in coagulation) to diagnose and trea t this condition. Cerebrovascular venous and sinus thrombosis: Events of cerebrovascular venous and sinus thrombosis without thrombocytopenia have been observed very rarely following vaccination with Vaxzevria. Some cases had a fatal outcome. The majority of these cases occurred within the first four weeks following vaccination. This information should be considered for individuals at increased risk for cerebrovascular venous and sinus thrombosis. These events may require differ ent treatment approaches than TTS and healthcare professionals should consult applicable guida nce. Thrombocytopenia :Cases of thrombocytopenia, including immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), have been reported after receiving Vaxzevria, typically within the first four weeks after vaccinatio n. Very rarely, these presented with ver y low platelet levels (<20,000 per \u00b5l) and/or were associated with bleeding. Some of these cases occurred in individuals with a history of immune thrombocytopenia. Cases wit hfatal outcome have been reported .If an individual has a history of a thrombocytopenic disorder, such as immune thrombocytopenia, the risk of developing low platelet levels should be considered before administering the vaccine and platelet monitoring is recommended after vaccination . Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism and /or thrombocytopenia. Those vaccinated should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swell ing, leg pain, persistent abdominal pain following vaccination. Additionally, anyone with neurological symptoms including severe or persistent headaches ,blurred vision , confusion or seizures after vaccination, or who experiences spontaneous bleeding, skin bruising (petechia) beyond the site of vaccination after a few days, should seek prompt medical attention. Individuals diagnosed with thrombocytopenia within three weeks after vaccination with Vaxzevria, should be actively investigated for signs of throm bosis. Similarly, individuals who present with thrombosis within three weeks of vaccination should be evaluated for thrombocytopenia. Risk of bleeding with intramuscular administration As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given wi th caution inindividuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia orany coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals.5Capillary leak syndrome Very rare cases of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) have been reported in the first days after vaccination with Vaxzevria. A history of CLS was apparent in some of the cases. Fatal outcome has been reported. CLS is a rare disorder characterised by acute episodes of oedema mainly affecting the limbs, hypotension, haemoconcentration and hypoalbuminaemia. Patients with an acute episode of CLS following vaccination require prompt recognition and treatment. Intensive supportive therapy is usually war ranted. Individuals with a known history of CLS should not be vaccinated with this vaccine. See also section 4.3. Neur ological events Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) and transverse myelitis (TM) havebeen reported very rarely following vaccination with Vax zevria. Healthcare professionals should be alert of GBS and TM signs and symptoms to ensure correct diagnosis, in order to initiate adequate supportive care and treatment, and to rule out other causes . Risk of very rare events after a booster dose The ri sk of very rare events (such as coagulation disorders including thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, CLS, GBS and TM) after a booster dose of Vaxzevria has not yet been characterised. Immunocompromised individuals The efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine have not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Vaxzevria may be lower in immunosuppressed individuals. Duration of protec tion The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical studie s. Limitations of vaccine effectiveness Protection starts from approximately 3 weeks after the first dose of Vaxzevria . Individuals may not be fully protected until 15days after the second dose is administered. As with a llvaccine s, vaccination with Vaxzevria may not protect all vaccine recipients (see section 5.1). Excipients Sodium This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.5ml dose, that is to say essentially \"sodium -free\". Ethanol This medicinal product contains 2 mg of alcohol (ethanol) per 0.5 ml dose. The small am ount of alcohol in this medicin al product will not have anynoticeable effects. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed. Concomitant administration of Vaxzevria with other vaccines ha snot been studied .64.6 Fertility, p regnancy and lactation Pregnancy Ther e is limited experience with use of Vaxzevria in pregnant women . Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or post -natal development (see section 5.3). Administration of Vaxzevria during pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and f oetus. Breastfeeding It is unknown whether Vaxzevria is excreted in human milk. In animal studies, lactational transfer of anti -SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies from maternal female mice to pups was observed (see section 5.3). Fertility Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3). 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Vaxzevria has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the adverse reactions mentioned under section 4.8 m ay temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile Primary vaccination course The overall safety of Vaxzevria is based on an analysis of pooled data from four clinical studie s phase I/II, II/III and III conducted in the United Kingdom, Brazil, and South Africa ,and of data from an additional phase III clinical study conducted in the United States, Peru and Chile . At the time of the analysis, a total of 56, 601participants 18years old had been randomised and of these, 33,846 received at least one dose of Vaxzevria and 32,030 received two doses. Participants continued to be followed for safety regardless of unblinding or receipt of unblinded vaccination. For the four clinical studies performed in the United Kingdom, Brazil, an d South Africa, longer follow -up of 12months (median 13.0 months) from first dose is available for 10,247 participants who received Vaxzevria. The most frequently reported adverse reactions areinjection site tenderness 68%),injection ( 22%). The majority of these adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity and usually resolved within a few days of vaccination. Very rare cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome have been reported post-marketing within the first three weeks following vaccination (see section 4.4).7Following vaccination with Vaxzevria , recipients may experience multiple adverse reactions occurring at the same time (for example, myalgia/arthralgia, headache, chills, pyrexia and malaise). When compared with the first dose, adverse reactions reported after the second dose were milder and less frequent. Reactogenicity was generally milder and reported less frequently in the population of older adults (65years old) . The safety profile was consistent across participants with or without prior evidence of SARS -CoV-2 infection at baseline. Booster dose (third dose) The safety profile observed in individuals who received a booster dose (third dose) was consistent with the known safety profile of Vaxzevria. No new safety concerns, as compared with adverse reactions reported for the primary v accination course with Vaxzevria, have been identified in individuals receiving a booster dose of Vaxzevria. Booster dose (third dose) following primary vaccination with Vaxzevria In study D7220C00001, 367 participants who had previously received a 2 -dose primary vaccination course with Vaxzevria received a single booster dose (third dose) of Vaxzevria. Median time between the second dose and the booster dose w as 8.6 mont hs (263 days). The most frequently reported adverse reactions in previously Vaxz evria vaccinated participants were injection site tenderness ( . The majority of these adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity and usually res olved w ithin a few days of vaccination. Booster dose (third dose) following primary vaccination with an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine In study D7220C00001 ,322participants who had previously received a 2 -dose primary vaccination course with an mRNA COVID -19vaccine received a single booster dose (third dose) of Vaxzevria. Median time between the second dose and the booster dose was 3.9 mont hs (119 days). The most frequently reported adverse reactions in previously mRNA vaccinated participants were injection site tenderness ( 71%),fatigue ( The majority of these adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity and usually res olved within a few days of vaccination. Tabulated list of adverse reactions The safety profile presented below is based on an analysis of data from five clinical studie s which included participants 18 years old (pooled data from four clinical studie s conducted in the United Kingdom, Brazil andSouth Africa ,and data from one clinical study conducted in the United States, Peru and Chile )and on data from post -authorisation experience. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are organised by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC). Frequencies of occurrence of adverse reactions are defined as: very common ( 1/10); common (1/10,000 to <1/1000); very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from available data) ; within each SOC, pr eferred terms are arranged by decreasing frequency and then by decreasing seriousness .8Table 1.

Onset was 8 and 15 days after first dose and 4, 17, and 25 days after the second dose. All events were reported to be non -serious .No cases of facial paralysis were repo rted in the placebo group. eSevere and very rare cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome have been reported post -marketing. These included venous thrombosis such as cerebral venous sinus splanchnic vein thrombosis, as well as arteri al thrombosis (see section 4.4). fInjection site bruising includes injection site haematoma (uncommon) .9Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactio ns via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V and include batch/Lot number if available . 4.9 Overdose Ther e is no specific treatment for an overdose with Vaxzevria . In the event of an overdose, the individual should be monitored and provided with symptomatic treatment as appropriate . 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties of action Vaxzevria is a monovalent vaccine composed of a single recombinant, replication -deficient chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAdOx1) vector encoding the S glycoprotein of SARS -CoV-2. The SARS -CoV-2 S immunogen in the vaccine is expressed in the trimeric pre -fusion conformation; the coding sequence has not been modified in order to stabilise the expressed S -protein in the pre -fusion confor mation. Following administration, the S glycoprotein of SARS -CoV-2 is expressed locally stimulating neutrali sing antibody and cellular immune responses , which may contribute to protection to COVID -19. Clinical efficacy Analysis of data from Study D8110C00001 The clinical efficacy of Vaxzevria has been evaluated based on an analysis of Study D8110C00001: a randomised, double -blinded, placebo -controlled phase III study conducted in the United States, Peru and Chile. The study excluded participants with severe an d/or uncontrolled cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, liver, renal, endocrine/metabolic disease, and neurological illnesses; as well as those with severe immunosuppression, pregnant women and participants with a known history of SARS -CoV-2 infection. All par ticipants are planned to be followed for up to 12 months, for assessments of efficacy against COVID -19 disease. Participants 18years of age received two doses (5 \u00d71010viral particles per dose corresponding to not less than 2.5 \u00d7108infectious units) of Vaxzevria (N=17,662) or saline placebo (N=8,550), administered via IM injection on Day 1 and Day 29 (-3to +7 days). The median dose interval was 29days and the majority of participants (95.7% and 95.3% for Vaxzevria and placebo , resp ectively) received the second dose 26 to 36 days after dose 1. Baseline demographics were well balanced across the Vaxzevria and placebo groups. Of the participants who received Vaxzevria, 79.1% were aged 18 to 64 years (with 20.9% aged 65 or older) and43.8% of subjects were female. Of those randomi sed, 79.3% were White, 7.9% were Black, 4.2% were Asian, 4.2% were American Indian or Alaska Native. A total of 10,376 (58.8%) participants had at least one pre -existing comorbidity, defined as :chronic kidne y disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower immune health because of a solid organ transplant, history of obesity (BMI >30), serious heart conditions, sickle cell disease, type 1 or 2 diabetes, asthma, dementia, cerebrovascular diseases, cystic fibrosis, high blood pressure, liver disease, pulmonary fibrosis, 10thalassemia or history of smoking. At the time of analysis the median follow -up time post -dose 2 was 61days. Final determination of COVID -19 cases were made by an adjudication committee. Overall vaccine efficacy and efficacy by key age groups are presented in Table 2.

Sever e or critical symptomatic COVID -19 illness was assessed as a key secondary endpoint . Among all subjects in the per protocol set, no cases of severe or critical symptomatic COVID -19 were reported in the vaccine group compared with 8 cases reported in the placebo group. There were 9hospitali sed cases, the 8 cases that were adjudicated as severe or critical symptomatic COVID -19, and one additional case in the vaccine group. Th e majority of the severe or critical symptomatic COVID -19 cases fulfilled only the oxygen saturation (SpO2) criterion for severe disease ( 93% on room air). In individuals with or without prior evidence of SARS -CoV-2 infection, the vaccine efficacy of Vaxzevria ( 15days 76 COVID -19 for Vaxzevria (N=18,563) and placebo (N=9,031), respectively. Participants with one or comorbidities who received Vaxzevria ( 15days CI :64.2;82.9) and participants without comorbidities had a vaccine efficacy of 71.8% (95% CI :55.5, 82. 1). In the 6 -month follow -up analysis, u pdated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID -19 case s accrued during blinded placebo -controlled follow -up, with a median follow -up of 78 days in participants who received Vaxzevria and 71 days in participants who received placebo . Overall vaccine efficacy against symptomatic COVID -19 illness was 67.0% (95% CI: 58.9, 73.5) with 141 (0.8%)cases of COVID -19 reported in participants who had received twodoses of Vaxzevria (N=17 ,617) and 184 (2.2%)cases reported in participants who had received placebo (N=8 ,528). In participants aged 18 to 64 years there were 135(1.0% )cases in the Vaxzevria group (N=13,921) versus 165 (2.5%)cases in the placebo group (N= 6,712), corresponding to a vaccine efficacy of 64.8% ( 95% CI: 55.7, 71.9) . In participants vaccine efficacy was 86.3% (95% CI: 65.8, versus 19(1.1%)cases in the placebo group (N= 1,816).11Analysis of pooled data from COV002 and COV003 The clinical efficacy of Vaxzevria has been evaluated based on a nanalysis of pooled data from two randomised, blinded, controlled studie s: a phase II/III study, COV002, in adults 18years of age (including the elderly) in the UK; and a phase III study, COV003, in adults 18years of age (including the elderly) in Brazil .The studies excluded participa nts with severe and/or uncontrolled cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, liver, renal, endocrine/metabolic disease, and neurological illnesses; as well as those with severe immunosuppression , pregnant women and participants with a known history of SARS -CoV-2infection . Influenza vaccines could be administered 7days before orafter any dose of Vaxzevria . In the pooled primary analysis for efficacy, participants 18years of age received two doses (5\u00d71010viral particles per dose corresponding to not less t han2.5\u00d7108infectious units ) ofVaxzevria saline) (N= 6,090 ),administered via IM injection. Because of logistical constrain ts, the interval between dose 1 and dose 2 ranged from 3 to 23weeks (21 to 159 days) , with 86.1% of participants receiving their two doses within the interval of 4 to 12weeks (28 to 84 days) . Baseline demographics were well balanced across Vaxzevria and control treatment groups. In the pooled primary analysis, among the participants who received Vaxzevria with a dose interval of between 4 and 12 weeks ,87.0% of participants were 18 to 64years old (with 13.0% aged 65 or older and 2.8% aged 75 or older ); 55.1% of subjects were female; 76.2% were White , 6.4% were Black and 3.4% wer e Asian. A total of 2,068 (39.3%) participants had at least one pre -existing comorbidity (defined as a BMI 30kg/m2, cardiovascular disorder, respiratory disease or diabetes) .At the time of analysis ,the median follow -up time post -dose 2 was 78days. Final determination of COVID -19 cases were made by an adjudication committee, who also assigned disease severity according to the WHO clinical progression scale. A total of 218participants had SARS -CoV-2 virologically confirmed COVID -19 oc curring 15days post second dose with at least one COVID -19 symptom (objective fever (defined as 37.8\u00b0C), cough, shortness of breath, anosmia, or ageusia) and were without evidence of previous SARS -CoV-2 infection. Vaxzevria significantly decreased the i ncidence of COVID -19 compared to control (see Table 3). Table 3.

Participants who had one or more comorbidities had a vaccine efficacy of 58.3%(95% CI: 2,040 ), respectively; which was similar to the vaccine efficacy observed in the overall population . Evidence shows protection starts from approximately 3 weeks after first dose of vaccine . A second dose should be given at a 4 to 12 -week interval after the first dose (see section4.4). Immunogenicity after booster dose Study D7220C00001 ,immunogenicity of a booster dose (third dose) following primary vaccination with Vaxzevria or an mRNA COVID -19vaccine D7220C00001 is a phase II/III partially double study in which 367participants 30years old vaccinated with Vaxzevria and 322 participant s30years oldpreviously vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine received a single booster dose of Vaxzevria at least 90days after receiving the second dose of the irprimary vaccination course. Immunogenicity w as assessed in 342 participants previously vaccinated with Vaxzevria and 294 participants previously vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine , all of whom were seronegative at baseline. The effectiveness of Vaxzevria administered as a single booster dose in participants pr eviously vaccinated with Vaxzevria was demonstrated by evaluating non -inferiority of the immune response of pseudo neutrali sing antibody titres against the ancestral strain compared to that elicited by a 2 -dose primary vaccination course in a subset of matched participants in study D8110C00001. Non-inferiority for GMT ratio was demonstrated when comparing pseudo neutrali sing antibody titres 28days after the booster dose to titres 28days after the primary vaccination course (see Table 4).

Vaxzevria was also shown to be effective in eliciting antibody responses in participants who had previous ly received primary vaccination with an mRNA vaccine. In these participants, a single booster dose of Vaxzevria resulted in increased humoral responses, with geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) of 3.77 (95% CI: 3.26, 4.37) in neutrali sing antibody titres again st the ancestral strain from pre -booster to 28days after the booster dose. Elderly population13Study D8110C00001 assessed the efficacy of Vaxzevria in 5,508 of age; 3,696 who received Vaxzevria and 1,812 who received placebo . The efficacy of Vaxzevria was consistent between elderly ( 65years) and younger adult subjects (18 -64years). Paediatric population The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Vaxzevria in one or more subsets of the paediatric population inprevention of COVID -19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not applicable. 5.3 Preclinical safety data In a repeat -dose toxicity study in mice, IM administration of Vaxzevria was well tolerated. Non - adverse, mixed and/or mononuclear cell inflammation was observed in the subcutaneous tissues and skeletal muscle of the administration sites and adjacent sciatic nerve consistent with the anticipated findings after IM i njection of vaccines. There were no findings in the administration sites or sciatic nerves at the end of the recovery period, indicating complete recovery of the Vaxzevria -related inflammation . Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity Neither genotoxicity nor carcin ogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine are not expected to have genotoxic potential. Reproductive toxicity In a reproductive and development toxicity study, Vaxzevria did not induce maternal or developmental toxicity following ma ternal exposure during the pre -mating, gestation or lactating periods. In this study, vaccine elicited detectable anti -SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein maternal antibodies were transferred to the foetuses and pups, indicating placental and lactational transfer, r espectively. No Vaxzevria data are available on vaccine excretion in milk. 6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS 6.1 List for injections 6.2 Incompatibilities This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products or diluted .146.3 Shelf life Unopened vial 9months when stored in a refrigerator ( 2\u00b0C-8\u00b0C) The following information is intended to guide healthcare professionals only in case of an unforeseen temporary temperature excursion. It is not a recommended storage or shipping condition. The shelf -life of unopened vials includes the following unfor eseen excursions from refrigerated storage (2\u00b0C -8\u00b0C) for a period of: - 12hours up to 30\u00b0C - 72hours down to -3\u00b0C Unopened vials must always be returned to refrigerated storage (2\u00b0C -8\u00b0C) following a temperature excursion. The occurrence of a temperature excursion for unopened vials does not impact how the vials should be stored after first opening (first vial puncture). Opened vial Chemical and physical in -use stability have been demonstrated for 6 hours when stored at temperatures up to 30\u00b0C and for 48 hours when stored in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C -8\u00b0C) .After this time, the vial must be discarded. Do not return it to the refrigerator after storage outside the refrigerator .

What you need to know before you are given Vaxzevria 3. How Vaxzevria is given 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Vaxzevria 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Vaxzevria is and what it is used for Vaxzevria is used for preventing COVID -19 caused by the SARS -CoV-2 virus. Vaxzevria is given to adults aged 18years and older. The vaccine causes the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce antibodies and specialised white blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID -19. None of the ingredi ents in this vaccine can cause COVID -19. 2. What you need to know before you are given Vaxzevria The vaccine must not be given : - If you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6). - If you have had a blood clot occurring at the same time as having low levels of blood platelets (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, TTS) after receiving Vaxzevria. - If you have a previous diagnosis of capillary leak syndrome (a condition causing fluid leak age from small blood vessels). Warnings and precautions Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Vaxzevria : - If you have ever had a severe allergic reaction after any other vaccine injection or after you were given Vaxzevria in the past ; - If you have ever fainted following any needle injection ; - Ifyou have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38\u00b0C) . However, you can have your vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold ; - If you have a problem with bleeding or bruising, or if you are taking a n anticoagulant medicine (to prevent blood clots);32- If your immune system does not work properly (immunodeficiency) or you are taking medicines that weaken the immune system (such as high -dose cortico steroids, immunosuppressants or cancer medicines) ; - If you previously had Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (temporary loss of feeling and movement) after being given Vaxzevria . - If you previously had Transverse Myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord) after being given Vaxzevria . If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine. As with any vaccine, the 2 -dose vaccination course of Vaxzevria may not fully protect all those who receive it.It is not know nhow long youwill be protected for. Blood disorders Very rare blood clots in combination with low level of blood platelets , in some cases together with bleeding, has been observed following vaccination with Vaxzevria . This included so me sever e cases with blood clots in different or unusual locations (e.g.,brain, bowel, liver, spleen) and excessive clotting or bleeding throughout the body. The majority of these cases occurred within the first three weeks following vaccination. Some cas es had a fatal outcome. Fewer cases have been reported after the second dose compared to after the first dose. Blood clots in the brain, not associated with low level of blood platelets have been observed very rarely following vaccination with Vaxzevria . The majority of these cases occurred within the first four weeks following vaccination. Some ca ses had a fatal outcome. Very low levels of blood platelets (immune thrombocytopenia) , that can be associated with bleeding, have been reported very rarely , usu ally within the first four weeks following vaccination with Vaxzevria. Seek immediate medical attention if you develop shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, leg pain or persistent abdominal pain following vaccination (see section 4). Also, seek immediate medical attention if you experience after a few days following vaccination sever e or persistent headaches, blurred vision, confusion or seizures (fits) after vaccination, or experience unexplained bleeding or skin bruising or pinpoint round spot s beyond the site of vaccination which appears after a few days (see section 4). Capillary leak syndrome Very rare cases of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) have been reported following vaccination with Vaxzevria. Some affected patients had a previous diagnosis of CLS. CLS is a serious, potentially fatal condition causing fluid leakage from small blood vessels (capillaries) resulting in rapid swelling of the arms and legs, sudden weight gain and feeling faint (low blood pressure). Seek immediate medical attention if you develop these symptoms in the days following vaccination. Neurological events Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) : Seek immediate medical attention if you develop weakness and paralysis in the extremities that can progr ess to the chest and face (Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome). This has been reported very rarely after vaccination with Vaxzevria. Inflammation of the spinal cord (transverse myelitis , TM ): Seek immediate medical attention if you develop signs of weakness inthe arms or legs , sensory symptoms (such as tingling, numbness, pain or loss of pain sensation) and urinary or bowel dysfunction . This has been reported very rarely after vaccination with Vaxzevria .33Risk of very rare events after a booster dose The risk of very rare events (such as blood disorders including thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, CLS, GBS, TM) after a booster dose of Vaxzevria is unknown. Children and adolescents Vaxzevria is not recommended for children aged below 18years .Currently there is not enough information available on the use of Vaxzevria in children and adolescents younger than 18 years of age.
