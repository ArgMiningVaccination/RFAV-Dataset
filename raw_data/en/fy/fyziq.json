Books of Ayurvedic medicine that date even from ancient times describe primarilyhistorical aspects, the principles of Ayurveda, and the most commonplants used for the prevention and therapy of diseases. The present textby Dr. M. S. Premila thus represents enormous progress, as it offers thefirst critical validation of traditional Ayurvedic medicine, which includesboth clinically proven formulas and medicines that urgently require fur-ther research efforts. Each of the 12 chapters, dealing with the mostprominent herbal drugs, enumerates the active chemical constituents,the relevant pharmacological and clinical data, and safety information,all extensively referenced. This first approach aims at what in Westernterms is called evidence-based medicine. The documentation is a valu-able guide for physicians and even Western-trained clinicians who areattentive to alternative and adjunctive therapies. It is a pleasure for me torecommend this book, without reservation, to all scientists in the field ofphytomedicine. I wish the book much success and broad distribution be-yond India. H. Wagner, PhD Professor Emeritus Centre of Pharma Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology University of Munich Munich, Germany \u00a9 2006 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1300/5683_b xiPreface Worldwide interest in Ayurveda is rapidly growing, especially in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Ayurveda, the major traditional system in India, is not just about herbs but is an entire system or a wayof living aimed at achieving a state of total mental, physical, and spir - itual well-being through lifestyle, diet, and drugs derived from herbs.Having worked on developing standardized and validated herbalproducts based on Ayurveda for around two decades, it never fails toamaze me how often Ayurvedic concepts and precepts receive scien-tific support. Therefore, when Professor Varro Tyler suggested abook on clinical data on Ayurvedic herbs, I was very happy to accedeto his request. His suggestion was to put together the scattered infor-mation available on Western-style clinical trials on Ayurvedic herbswith descriptions, comments, and references, since there was a needfor such a book owing to lack of information and limited access tothese aspects. This book attempts to bridge the knowledge gap and gather the scattered information on Ayurvedic herbs to see what scientific supportthere is for the traditional use of these plants. In doing so, I am awareof the fact that Ayurveda considers disease as an imbalance in doshas, or humors, and that healing is brought about by bringing back harmony tothe \"deranged\" doshas. However, Ayurvedic herbs have also been clas- sified according to their pharmacological action or indication. For manyAyurvedic disease entities and their symptoms described in Ayurveda,there are modern equivalent medicines; thus, there are a number ofWestern-style clinical studies conducted on single Ayurvedic herbs. It has also long been my desire to be able to pull all the relevant infor - mation into a cohesive whole. The herbs have been dealt with accordingto body systems and indications in order to provide an easier overview. \u00a9 2006 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1300/5683_c xiiiThus, after the two introductory chapters, which highlight the rele - vance of the background of Ayurveda, the herbs are covered in 12 chapters. Each chapter on herbs gives a short introduction of theAyurvedic viewpoint, where relevant, after which the important plantmonographs follow. Each plant monograph covers synonyms: namesin Sanskrit, English, Hindi, and Tamil. The names are followed by ashort introduction, a description of the plant and its distribution inIndia, traditional use, the part used as a drug, chemical constituents,pharmacology, clinical studies, and safety information. Some herbs have names only in a particular language depending on the region where they grow predominantly. Salacia species, for example, have local names in Malayalam, the language used inKerala, which are descriptive of the different species. Thus, Salacia macrosperma, with its sprawling habit, is called in reference to the yellow color of root bark. Salacia prinoides is called cherukoranti (cheru: \"small\"). In cases where a plant occurrence is more regional, preference is given to thelocal name. At this point, it should be mentioned that large variation exists in the way local names are spelled in English, and the spelling given byan author is often retained. This happens less often with botanicalnames. The description of traditional use covers the major uses; similarly, the description of the plant covers details of what is important for its use. The chemical constituents refer to active principles, where known, or to chemical classes or compounds that on the basis of currentknowledge can be considered to contribute to the activity. Some of the plants have more than one use. Thus, the same plant may occur in more than one chapter and in more than one section of achapter. For example, ginger (Zingiber officinale) is used as an anti- emetic and to treat malabsorption and finds place in two sectionsin Chapter 3, \"Gastrointestinal agents.\" Ginger also finds its anti-inflammatory effect.Turmeric (Curcuma longa) is a common ingredient of curry and is used for digestion (Chapter 3). In addition, it is used in the treatmentxiv AYURVEDIC HERBSof arthritis (Chapter 8), for asthma (Chapter 5, \"Respiratory tract drugs\") and oral cancer (Chapter 13, \" Rasayana drugs\"). Each portion on pharmacology deals only with studies that are rele - vant to the indication covered. Other known pharmacological studies fordifferent uses not relevant to the particular indication are not cited. Onlyuses supported by clinical studies have been included. Thus, turmeric orcurcumin is mentioned in discussions of the gastrointestinal tract, anti-rheumatic agents, asthma drugs, and anticancer drugs because somesupporting clinical data are available. Similarly, Commiphora mukul, or guggul , finds a place in the discussions of hypolipidemic agents and antirheumatic agents, but not under agents used for thyroid stimulationeven though experimental evidence is available. In reporting clinical trials, the Ayurvedic indication and the mod- ern medicine correlate as given by the authors have been included.For example, the condition known as amlapitta in Ayurveda is charac- terized by such symptoms as nausea, tiredness, sour vomiting, burningin the throat, thirst, vertigo, and hyperchlorhydria. Amlapitta has been variously described as acid dyspepsia, nonulcer dyspepsia, and gastritissyndrome. Some of the trials reported have certain basic data missing,such as the botanical name of the drug or the doses administered. Asthese trials correspond to traditional uses with supporting pharmacol-ogy, they could serve as indicators for further trials and have thereforebeen included. In some cases, specifications for the drug used should beurgently established so that it is possible to have reproducible results.This is especially true in the case of plants that have different eco- andchemotypes, for example, Acorus calamus andPhyllanthus amarus. In addition, there have been problems in trying to group plants for a particular indication, as some of the trials are of an exploratorynature and cover several indications such as bronchial asthma, aller - gic rhinitis, or viral encephalitis. These have been grouped togetherunder the same heading because, during the trial, the plant prepara - tion would have been tried simultaneously for other indications aswell, and presently, it would fragment information if grouped sepa - rately, since available information is scarce. Therefore, plants forpeptic ulcer, nonulcer dyspepsia, and gastritis are grouped underantiulcer plants.Preface xvSafety information has been summarized under each monograph. Most of the plants have not been investigated adequately by modern standards of safety. Nonetheless, the herbs have been in use for a verylong time and any toxicity should have become evident by now. In addi - tion, Ayurveda prescribes the manner in which herbs are to be used orprocessed before use. For example, if Commiphora mukul resin is not processed using triphala, or an equivalent method, side effects are seen. In addition, the age of the resin influences its efficacy, as mentioned intheSushruta Samhita . In order to help locate the different plants and their indications for which information is available, an appendix has been added at theback of the book. This lists the names of plants, their indications, andchapter number. The chapter number in bold face is indicative ofwhere introductory details of the plant are given. Also included are color plates of watercolor paintings of 12 major Ayurvedic herbs, done by me. I hope that this book will be of use not only to health care professio- nals but also to anyone interested in knowing more about Ayurvedicherbs. M. S.

I am grateful to Professor Varro Tyler for recommending this topic when I wrote to him with my own book suggestion. Unfortunately, heis not here to see the result. I am happy that I was able to meet himbriefly in Chennai, during his very busy conference schedule in June2001. Few of us at that time could have imagined that would be thelast time we would see him. Databases form the core of providing the numerous references that go into a book. Apart from numerous journals and my own per-sonal literature collection, I have made extensive use of the Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Abstracts (MAPA) published by the National Institute of Science Communication and Information ResourcesNISCAIR (earlier known as Publications and Information Directorate),CSIR, New Delhi, and their earlier CD. Also very useful have beenthe Medline database provided by BioMedical Net (bmn) andPubMed of the National Medical Library, U.S.A. For access to somemissing volumes of MAPA, I am grateful to Dr. P. K. Sehgal, CLRI,Chennai. Thanks are due also to Professor M. A. Iyengar for sendingme a copy of his Bibliography of Investigated Medicinal Plants (1950-1975) .

The globalsearch for alternative strategies for health care has been driven by agrowing dissatisfaction with the inadequacy of modern medicines incertain disease areas, notably in chronic conditions such as arthritisand asthma, and with their distressing iatrogenic effects. This dissat-isfaction is combined with the urge to adopt a more natural way of re-lating to the world and to return to nature. The search has led toworldwide interest in the scientific validation of the therapeuticefficacy of traditional plant-based medicines. In India there arose some 3,000 years ago one of the most compre- hensive and complete systems of medicine\u2014Ayurveda, which in itsholistic approach goes beyond the mere prescription of drugs. Theaim of Ayurveda is twofold: to lead a healthy life full of vigor and, inthe event of disease, to bring about healing. Disease is considered tobe the absence of harmony, and Ayurveda involves taking measuresto restore harmony and thereby health. This is achieved through athreefold plan of lifestyle, diet, and drugs in accordance with an indi - vidual's constitution and the season. Health is not merely the absenceof disease but a state of total physical, mental, spiritual, and socialwell-being. In Ayurveda, drugs are one component of the therapeutic \u00a9 2006 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1300/5683_01 1modality, and drugs of plant, mineral, and animal origin are used. However, herbs constitute approximately 70 percent of the Ayurvedicmateria medica. Ayurveda translates to \"science or knowledge of life,\" Ayur meaning \"life\" and Veda meaning \"knowledge\" or \"science.\" Ayurveda is considered to be an auxiliary Veda (upveda) or some - times as a fifth Veda ,the first four being the Rig Veda, theYajur Veda, theSama Veda, and the Atharva Veda. The Vedas are a body of knowledge considered to be of nonhuman (divine) origin. Dismayedby the growing incidence of disease, the sages and other wise men inearly times beseeched the divine creator for help in alleviating humansuffering. In the tradition of the Caraka Samhita, the divine creator through various intermediaries transmitted the science of Ayurvedato Indra and from Indra to sages such as Bharadwaja, Atri, and others,who then taught Ayurveda to their disciples; however, in the traditionof the Sushruta Samhita, it is Dhanvantri who received the science from Indra. 1A description of the first conclave on preventive health and therapeutic measures to treat disease appears in the first recordedtext of Ayurveda, known as the Caraka Samhita, which is often dated to 700 BC. The next major texts were the Sushruta Samhita, which deals with surgery, and the Astanga Hrdayam of Vagbhata. The three physicians Caraka, Sushruta, and together form the so-called Greater Triad, or Brihattrayi. Ayurvedic drugs were chosen by a combination of observation, experiment, intuition, and discussion among scholars. The intuitiveelement helped to select the most suitable plants, which were triedout on domestic animals such as cats, dogs, and cows. Their use wasfurther refined by discussion among scholars, and disputes amongscholars were resolved through regular meetings. The Caraka Samhita speaks of such meetings in the foothills of the Himalayas. Controversy was also resolved in each case by experimentation onhuman beings. 2 What emerged from this long period of trial and experimentation on human beings is a large number of herbs of proven clinical utility.It is the results of this experimentation that are available today in theextremely terse written form known as sutras.2 AYURVEDIC HERBSHISTORY OF DRUG EVALUATION Medicinal plants and herbs are an important part of the Ayurvedic formulary. The use of more than 1,700 herbs has been described in Ayurveda. It is interesting at this point to review briefly the history ofplant usage\u2014drug collection, selection, and evaluation. Great attentionwas paid in ancient times to ensuring the quality, safety, and efficacy ofthe herbs used. The chemical contents of plants vary according to soil, location, season, time of day, time of year, manner of harvesting, andfurther processing. It is remarkable how these aspects were delin - eated several hundred years ago. In the Kasyapa Samhita, the steps to be followed before a plant can be used as medicine are enumerated:plants must be cultivated on suitable soil, in the proper season; theymust be collected at the appropriate time, ensuring the absence ofdamage from heat, water, insects, stools, urine, and time; and theymust be collected or grown in areas away from roadsides, cemeteries,and so on. 3 In terms of the proper growing season, the Caraka Samhita men- tions that leaves are to be collected in spring (March-April) and therainy season (July-September). 4Some scientific evidence corrobo- rates this. Adhatoda vasica leaves are used for the treatment of coughs, colds, asthma, and bronchitis. In one study, the content of themajor alkaloid and active principle and bronchodilator vasicine wasanalyzed throughout the year and plotted to yield a curve showingtwo major peaks in March-April and July-September correspondingto periods when the vasicine content was highest thereby showinggood correlation with the guidelines of Caraka. 5 The efficacy of herbs and their action was often a discussion point among scholars, with differing opinions resolved through observa - tions on human beings. Unfortunately, the actual experimental proce - dures followed are no longer available to us. What have been writtendown are the final results of discussion and experimentation, consist - ing of the names of the plants to be used in various conditions and thetreatment to be followed. The tremendous regard for the safety of the drugs used and the manner in which they were to be processed led to any doubts beingresolved by testing on domestic animals. 6Processing was consideredDrug Development and Evaluation in Ancient India 3essential to reduce or remove toxicity and also to increase bioavail - ability. Many plants that are toxic or poisonous find use in Ayurveda after \"purification,\" or shodana. The tubers of Aconitum, for exam - ple, are often used in Ayurveda although they contain the toxic alka - loid aconitine. This is possible because the drug is processed or de - toxified before it is used. Boiling Aconitum tubers in water converts the toxic aconitine to aconine, which is less toxic.7Commiphora mukul gum resin is widely used in Ayurveda for the treatment of ar - thritis and is traditionally processed before use by boiling the resin inwater or a decoction of triphala, or mukul as a hypolipidemic agent, it was found that the crude material produced minor side effects such asskin rashes, diarrhea, and irregular menstruation. After the materialwas purified in the traditional manner by boiling and skimming, it nolonger caused skin rashes. 8 PLANT USE IN AYURVEDA A large number of plants are used in Ayurveda to maintain balance and harmony so that it is possible to enjoy good health. Plants wereoften combined to create synergy, reduce toxicity, and increasebioavailability. Multiplant preparations were and still are generallypreferred, although a large number of single drugs were also used.However, very few studies have been carried out to provide scientificsupport to validate these combinations, not least because of the prob - lems associated with devising a suitable methodology to do this. Bioavailability It has been possible to show an increase in bioavailability when either the traditional three-spice or pungent mixture known as trikatu (tri:\"three\"; katu: \"pungent\"), consisting of Piper . nigrum (pepper), and Zingiber officinale (ginger), is added to for - mulations or alkaloid piperine . nigrum is added. 9,10This concept has also been used to reduce the required dosage of anti-TB drugs such as rifampicin or other drugs such as4 AYURVEDIC HERBSciprofloxacin.11Controlled studies have also shown that in healthy volunteers the absorption of nutraceuticals such as /H9252-carotene and curcumin can be increased severalfold\u2014by 60 percent in the case of /H9252-carotene through the addition of small quantities of piperine12and 2000 percent by addition of 20 mg piperine to 2 g curcumin.13 Synergy A few clinical studies have shown the beneficial effects of combin - ing drugs. Thus, combined therapy in osteoarthritis, frozen shoul - der, and sciatica than the individual drugs alone.14Other examples in- clude the addition of Bacopa monnieri to the combination of Inula racemosa andCommiphora mukul for the treatment of heart disease (see Chapter 6, \"Cardiovascular drugs\"), the combination of Gymnema sylvestre and Eugenia jambolana for diabetes (see Chapter and the combination of Zingiber officinale andCommiphora mukul for arthritis (see Chapter 8, \"Antirheumatic agents\"). Any scientific study of Ayurvedic herbs would benefit greatly from a study of the ideas, concepts, and pronouncements given inearly Ayurvedic texts regarding plant collection, processing, combi-nation, selection, and use to see how these correlate with present-dayscientific understanding. Even a brief look at the history of Ayurvedaand drug development in ancient India and at some of the conceptsused in drug formulation shows much can be learned and under - stood from the ancient texts. Such a venture could prove to be very re - warding. NOTES 1. Sharma PV . Vedic medicine. In Sharma PV (ed.), History of medicine in India (p. 3). New Delhi: Indian National Science Academy, 1992. 2.

Clinical studies of HERBSChapter 2 Scientific Investigation of Indian Medicinal Plants HISTORY OF RESEARCH The scientific investigation of Indian medicinal plants, especially of those used in Ayurveda, started in the early part of the twentieth century with the extensive investigations of Dr. R. N. Chopra. His far-reaching work and documentation in the years 1930-1950 earned himthe title \"Father of Indian Pharmacology.\" 1-3His work triggered ma- jor interest in the further exploration of the wealth of knowledgeavailable in indigenous systems of medicine, mostly by chemical andpharmacological researchers, initially through individual effort inuniversities and then through team efforts in various institutions in-cluding the Indian Council of Medical Research 4,5and the Indian Council for Research in Indian Medicine (now the Central Councilfor Research in Ayurveda and Siddha). 6Broad-based screening of Indian medicinal plants was undertaken by the Central Drug Re - search Institute in Lucknow,7-9and specific research into individual plants and yoga therapy was carried out at the Faculty of Indian Med - icine of the Institute of Medical Sciences at the Banaras Hindu Uni - versity.10This list is not exhaustive. The Ayurvedic literature on therapeutics and materia medica formed the basis for chemical, pharmacological, and clinical re - search. Important single-drug preparations and compound drugs com - prising multiplant preparations were studied. The major efforts were \u00a9 2006 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1300/5683_02 7expended in chemical and pharmacological studies, with an emphasis on what was possible based on the available materials and researchfacilities. Thus, for example, chemical work generally tended to usenonpolar solvents, probably because the methodology to deal withnonpolar compounds was better developed. Later, with the awarenessthat aqueous decoctions and infusions were the major mode of ad - ministration, researchers realized the need to look at polar com - pounds such as glycosides, tannins, and sugars. Working with such compounds was made easier by advances in separation science and the development of newer adsorbents such as Sephadex and new equipment based on countercurrent chromatography. A similar trendwas seen in pharmacological and clinical work. Considering that inIndia paucity of funds has been a major constraint, the work that hasbeen carried out is laudable. Far less clinical work has been performed than pharmacological and chemical studies. A review of literature published between 1950and 1975 shows that only 1.36 percent of the entries dealt with clini-cal trials, compared with 17.46 percent for pharmacological studiesand 63.42 percent for chemical studies. 11,12 Other problems include the fact that many of the clinical trials were of a preliminary or exploratory nature and were carried out onsmall numbers of patients. The methodology has often been far fromsatisfactory. In some cases, promising leads have not been followedup to confirm early results. Many of the results have been published in non-peer-reviewed journals that are difficult to access. Among the various problems faced in reporting clinical trials on herbs used inAyurveda, one concerns relating Ayurvedic disease entities to modernparameters, or in other words the problem of Western-style clinicalstudies being applied to Ayurveda, which has its own concepts and ba - sis. In addition, relatively few randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trials have been carried out. Despite this, a tremendousamount of information has been generated that shows Ayurvedic herbs and concepts to have a very sound scientific basis. Any investi - gation of Ayurvedic drugs needs to look at the rationale behind their use, the mode of use, and the methods of drug collection and processing.8 AYURVEDIC HERBSRESULTS OF SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION As a result of scientific investigation into Ayurvedic herbs, a few trends or results can be seen. 1. There is better understanding of the specific role played by an herb. It is now possible to understand the pharmacological profile of the drugs suited to certain disease areas so that a choice can be made with regard to the drug to be used. For example, Ayurvedic herbs for theliver are often used for the treatment of jaundice, which is a generalterm to describe inflammation of the liver and could result from theintake of alcohol or drugs or be of viral origin. Studies now enablebetter decisions to be made regarding whether a drug useful for jaun-dice has specific action against the Hepatitis B virus (say, by bindingthe Hepatitis B surface antigen), whether it is hepatoprotective orantihepatotoxic, whether it helps in liver cell regeneration, andwhether it has anti-inflammatory activity or an antifibrotic effect. 13 2. Modern methods confirm ancient concepts and use. The gum resin of Commiphora mukul, orguggul in Sanskrit, which is widely used in arthritis, is also described as being a usefulanti-obesity drug, and descriptions of its etiopathogenesis corre-spond remarkably well with modern ideas of how obesity arises. Re-search has now shown its effectiveness as a hypolipidemic agent withcholesterol-lowering properties. 14 3. The elucidation of mechanisms of action explains use in different indications. The gum resin of Boswellia serrata is traditionally used for a num - ber of indications, including rheumatism, arthritis, asthma, gastroin - testinal tract problems, and tumors. After the resin was shown toact to inhibit 5-lipoxygenase (and leukotriene synthesis), it was hy - pothesized that it would be useful in bronchial asthma, ulcerative co - litis and Crohn's disease\u2014that is, in conditions where leukotrienesynthesis is considered responsible for initiation and perpetuationof the disease. This hypothesis has now been supported by clinicaltrials. 15Scientific Investigation of Indian Medicinal Plants 94. Some crude drugs and their isolated components are COX-2 inhibitors. COX-2 inhibitors are considered to be devoid of the usual side ef - fects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Several crude drugs and their active principles have been shown to be COX-2inhibitors, for example, turmeric, curcumin, holy basil (Ocimumsanctum), rosmarinic acid, and ursolic acid. 16-18 5. Evidence supports the concept of anti-aging agents . Two categories of drugs in Ayurveda, the rasayana and the vayasthapana drugs, are considered to be useful in reducing the effects of aging. Many of these drugs have powerful antioxidant properties.19 For example, although turmeric is not a rasayana drug, curcuminoids from turmeric or longa fect than grape seed extract.20The ancient sage Chyavan is said to have rejuvenated himself using a concoction of herbs named after him:Chyavanprash. The major ingredient, Emblica officinalis oramla, is a potent antioxidant. Amla fruit, considered to be one of the richest sources of vitamin C, also contains other potent antioxidant com-pounds. The role of free radical scavengers in cancer, antiaging, diabe-tes, and so on is well recognized today. 6. The trend is toward use of enriched fractions. A change is taking place in the way crude drugs are used. With the introduction of many standardized herbs, enriched fractions containinglarger amounts of the active components are preferred, for example,Boswellic acids from Boswellia Chopra Glossary of Indian Medicinal Plants .N e w Delhi: Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, 1956. 2.

A weak di- gestion, known as mandagni, is considered to be the main cause of all diseases, including gastrointestinal disorders.1Therefore, spices and herbs have been commonly added to food or taken as drugs to im- prove digestion, aid absorption, and promote elimination. The twomost commonly used spices in Indian cooking are ginger and tur-meric. Clinical trials covering such common, classical uses are rare.However, a clinical trial has been carried out to evaluate the efficacyof ginger in malabsorption syndrome Ginger Zingiber officinale, or ginger, is a slender perennial herb with rhizomes that is cultivated widely throughout India. The rhizomes are very commonly used in Ayurvedic medicine in both fresh and dryforms, though more usually in the dry form. In Sanskrit, ginger is \u00a9 2006 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1300/5683_03 13known as a universal medicine, or vishwa bhesaj (vishwa : universal; bhesaj: medicine). It is also referred to as a great medicine, or maha aushadi (maha: great; aushadi: medicine). The drug consists of the roots or rhizomes of the plant. Traditionally, ginger is used in Ayurveda as a stomachic, to promote digestion, and for dyspepsia,flatulence, colic, vomiting, fever, coughs, colds, asthma, gout, andchronic rheumatism. It is also used externally to treat headache andtoothache and to improve blood circulation. 3The drug is approved in the Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia, 2002, for its carminative, antiemetic, and anti-inflammatory properties.4The use of ginger as an antiemetic is discussed later in this chapter, and its use as an anti-inflammatory agent is covered in Chapter 8 \"Antirheumatic agents.\" The rhizome contains 1-2 percent of an essential oil that has a vari - able composition, depending upon the variety and the location of theplant, and 5-8 percent of an oleoresin. The oleoresin contains the non-volatile pungent principles, the gingerols\u2014mainly [6]-gingerol, andalso [8]-gingerol and [10]-gingerol\u2014which vary in terms of thelength of their side chain and are considered to be among the activeprinciples. The corresponding dehydration products, the shogaolsthat arise from the gingerols on drying, are generally not found in thefresh plant. 3,4 In Ayurveda, ginger is considered to be useful at every stage of di- gestion: digestion (dipan), absorption (pachan), and elimination (grahi). Thus, it is regarded as having a role in the prevention of accu- mulation of toxic materials (ama) in the body. Ginger has been shown to increase salivary5and gastric secretion,6act as a cholagogue,7dis- play spasmolytic activity in animals,8and increase peristalsis on oral administration.9In combination with two other pungent spices, pep - per and long pepper, known as trikatu, ginger is commonly used in Ayurveda to increase bioavailability of other drugs by promotingtheir absorption or by preventing their metabolism during their firstpassage through the liver. 10 An open trial was conducted on 111 patients with grahni roga, or malabsorption syndrome.2Inclusion criteria were chronic history of alternating diarrhea and constipation, loss of appetite, indigestion,history of loose motions, physical weakness, and loss of weight.Three grams of dried ginger powder was given thrice daily with14 AYURVEDIC HERBSwarm water for 1 month. Patients were admitted as in-patients for treatment with ginger and were given a hospital diet. The duration ofthe disease in the patients ranged from 1 month to 7 years; 36 patientshad the disease for 1 to 2 years and formed the largest group. Mostpatients were generally anemic and had more than four motions aday. A total of 26 patients had Giardia infections, and 27 patients had Entamoeba histolytica cysts. Treatment resulted in reduction of the number of motions to one to two per day, increase in hemoglobin lev - els, increase in body weight and general health, and elimination ofcysts in giardiasis and amoebiasis in a majority of patients. 2Thus the beneficial effect that ginger has on absorption has been revealed.However, considering the potential usefulness of the drug, furthercontrolled studies are required. Ginger has a low acute toxicity. In one study on mice, an alcoholic extract given at a dose of 2.5 g/H11080kg -1body weight (equivalent to 75 g fresh rhizome) for 7 days showed no mortality and no side effects ex-cept for mild diarrhea in two animals. 11No side effects have been re- ported in clinical trials.12Experiments to test the mutagenic and antimutagenic potential of ginger and isolated constituents haveshown variable results depending upon the components present andthe bacterial strain used. 13Based on the possible mutagenic potential, some authors warn against the use of ginger during pregnancy indoses larger than the amount taken in food (1-2 g per day) 13,14Also, the use of ginger in conjunction with diabetic, cardiac, and anticoag-ulant therapy is not advocated, because synergistic effects may resultfrom taking ginger in excessive amounts owing to the prolongedhypoglycemic activity of ginger in vivo, its positive inotropic action,and its inhibiting action on platelet aggregation). 13In sensitive pa - tients, ginger may cause gastric irritation.13 NOTES 1.

(See the section \"Other antiulcer plants\" below for nonulcer dyspep- sia.) Reports of clinical trials use the term to denote the Ayurvedic con - dition known as amlapitta turmeric, is a slender perennial herb with fleshy roots. It is cultivated as an annual crop throughout the warmer parts of India. In India, turmeric is very commonly used as a spiceand as an ingredient of curry, giving it a characteristic yellow color.Turmeric is also considered auspicious and is used in Hindu rituals. Itis widely used by women as a cosmetic to protect the skin and preventgrowth of body and facial hair. Traditionally, it has been used as a stomachic and carminative, the powdered drug being given for flatulence and dyspepsia. It is mixedin milk and taken as an expectorant in household cough and cold rem - edies, and used externally either by itself or as a paste with neem (Azadirachta indica) leaves for its antiseptic and healing action. The dried rhizomes are listed in the Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia, 2002, as an anti-inflammatory, stomachic, and tonic agent. 1 The rhizome contains yellow coloring curcumin III, as minor constituents; 2-7 percent of an essential oil with a high content of bisabolane deriva-tives; and the polysaccharides ukonan A, B, and C. 1,2 Turmeric powder increases the mucin content of gastric juice in rabbits; it may thus exert a protective effect on the gastric mucosa ingastric disorders. 3In isolated guinea pig ileum, the soluble sodium salt of curcumin\u2014sodium curcuminate\u2014exerts an against various spasmogens. 4In addition, turmeric oil suppresses the growth of some intestinal, pathogenic, and toxigenic bacteria.5In vitro, curcumin at 0.05 percent concentration reduces intestinal gasformation by Clostridium perfringens; in vivo, curcumin at 0.1 per - cent concentration reduces intestinal gas formation on feeding ratsalong with chickpea flour\u2014a known flatulent diet. 6In studies from the 1950s,7-9the choleretic and cholagogic effects of the essential oil and sodium curcuminate administered intravenously were demon - strated. In more recent studies, curcuminoids and the essential oilstimulated bile secretion in isolated perfused rat liver . An increaseboth in the production of bile and in the bile concentration was seen. 10 In a rat bile fistula model, a choleretic effect was shown by a mixtureof the three curcuminoids, by curcumin I, and also by curcumin III,Gastrointestinal Agents 17which had earlier been considered to be inactive as a choleretic.11,12In cholestatis caused by cyclosporine, bisdemethoxycurcumin and the curcuminoid mixture caused a reduction in cholestatis, with the ef - fect of bisdemethoxycurcumin being much greater than that of themixture. 12A potent cholagogic effect has also been reported for the essential oil.13 In a randomized, double-blind, study on 106 patients with acid dyspepsia, flatulent dyspepsia, or atonic dyspepsia patients were ran - domized to one of three groups\u2014turmeric, placebo, or a multiplantpreparation known as \"Flatulence.\" Thus in 38 patients 500 mg tur - meric powder was given four times a day for 1 week. At the end of7 days the group of 38 patients on turmeric showed a statistically sig-nificant difference from the placebo group (38 patients); 30 patientswere on \"Flatulence,\" a multiplant preparation, for comparison andresults comparable to turmeric were obtained. 14 Another study examined 440 patients with dyspeptic symptoms of 17 weeks'duration. Of those, 36 percent had irritable bowel syndrome,34 percent dyspepsia, 18 percent functional disturbances of the gallbladder, and 12 percent other digestive disturbances. In addition,78 percent of patients presented a psychosomatic disease componentsymptoms worsening with mental stress. The trial preparation con-sisted of capsules containing 81 mg of 96 percent ethanolic Curcuma longa extract, which extracts the active components\u2014the essential oil and the curcuminoids. Two capsules were given daily for 4 weeks. Theresults showed a definite reduction (67.8 percent) in dyspeptic symp - toms, especially pain in the upper and lower abdomen, the feeling ofpressure, the feeling of fullness, and abdominal bloating. Most patientscould feel a difference after an average of 6 days of treatment. Thegood compliance was attributed to the dosage schedule of only twocapsules per day. In addition, the global tolerance was evaluated by95.3 percent of patients as either \"excellent\" or \"very good.\" 15,16 Turmeric is generally regarded as safe. In individuals not previ - ously exposed to turmeric the possibility of allergic reactions hasbeen reported, 1although turmeric is itself considered to have an anti - allergic effect. The literature on the safety of turmeric and curcuminhas been extensively reviewed, and they have been found to be safeeven at high doses. However, turmeric can cause gastric irritation in18 AYURVEDIC HERBSsusceptible individuals.17In a trial on patients with bronchial asthma who were given 12 g/H11080day-1of turmeric powder, a few patients com - plained of dryness of the mouth and throat, which was assuaged by a reduction of the dose.18 NOTES 1.Indian herbal (rev. new edn., Medpharm Scientific Publishers, 2001. 3.

ANTIULCER PLANTS Peptic ulcers are a chronic disorder of the gut caused by a number of predisposing factors such as stress, genetic factors, acid pepsin secretion, and mucosal resistance. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflamma tory drugs (NSAIDS) are considered major contributory factors.1Peptic ulcer has been equated with the disease entity known as parinam shula in Ayurveda. Hyperacidity, or amlapitta, is considered to form part of the same spectrum and is therefore often included as part of the same clinicaltrials. A number of plants have been used in Ayurveda for the man-agement of the two conditions. 2 - sive, spinous climbing shrub that is covered with a mass of smallwhite flowers after the rains. It has numerous succulent tuberousroots that form the drug. It is found throughout the tropical and sub - tropical parts of India. Shatavari is best known for promoting milk production and for helping a pregnancy run to its full term. Its use inprotecting the stomach against irritation is also well known. Despitethe widespread use of shatavari as a nutritive tonic, only limited scientific information is available. It is mentioned in the ancient textsas being useful for peptic ulcers. A number of saponins have been20 AYURVEDIC HERBSisolated from the roots and of these shatavarin IV has been shown to have antioxytocic activity.3 Asparagus racemosus has been shown to exert a protective effect in experimentally induced abdominal sepsis in rats.4 Many minor studies have been conducted with few patients by dif - ferent authors and it is deduced that there seems to be a beneficial ef - fect of shatavari on ulcers. However, more major studies are needed with greater numbers of patients and dose-searching studies to betterdelineate both the quality of the drug and the dosage required. In an exploratory study, shatavari was given in doses of four 0.5 g tablets of root powder six times a day in a number of conditions diag-nosed by Ayurvedic and tis), and was found to be more effective in acute diarrhea, dysentryand gastritis, and in some cases of gastric ulcer and hyperacidity. 5 Three grams of shatavari root powder was given four times a day to 32 patients with proven duodenal ulcer for an average of 6 weeks.Most of the patients were relieved of the distressing symptoms.It did not exhibit any antacid activity. This effect was attributedtoshatavari's direct healing effect on ulcers by strengthening the mucosal resistance or by cytoprotection. 6It has also been shown to help heal duodenal ulcers. Twenty-three patients with duodenal ulcerwere treated with 25 mL of freshly expressed juice of Asparagus racemosus roots with 10 mL of honey 2-3 times a day for 45 days along with specific diet. Fourteen patients had complete relief, sevenpatients felt partial relief, and there were two dropouts. 7Twenty pa - tients with duodenal ulcer confirmed by Barium meal, X-ray, andgastric analysis were given 20 g per day of shatavari root powder in three divided doses with milk for 1 month. Of the 20 patients, 15 hadhyperacidity, whereas the remaining 5 had normal levels of gastricacidity. There was significant reduction in total acids and free hydro - chloric acid of gastric juice. The results were evaluated as \"excellent\"in 50 percent and \"good\" in 30 percent of duodenal ulcer cases al - though 15 percent showed poor response. 8In eight healthy normal male volunteers, 2 g of shatavari was found to be equally effective inGastrointestinal Agents 21accelerating the gastric emptying as metoclopramide, a drug used in dyspepsia.9 A clinical trial was conducted on 109 patients with acid dyspepsia (amlapitta) in order to compare the efficacy of three different shatavari preparations\u2014the single drug, shatavari in combination with other herbs, and a herbomineral preparation. All the three prepa - rations were found equally effective; efficacy not being altered by ad - dition of either herbs or minerals.10 In doses used clinically, no adverse reactions have been reported.11 Using two species and dose levels of 50 mg /H11080kg-1to 1 g/H11080kg-1body weight, the acute (for 72 hours) and subacute toxicity (for 4 weeks) ofthe aqueous extract has been studied and found to be nontoxic. No organ toxicity was seen and there was improvement in phagocytic and killing capacity of monocytes 1 in color gallery) is a medium-sized deciduous tree found both in the wild and cultivated throughout thetropical parts of India up to an elevation of 1,500 m. The yellowish green fruits are borne in bunches and are used widely in Indian cui - sine to make preserves\u2014jams, pickles, or wedges\u2014sun-dried in or - der to ensure a supply throughout the year when the tree is not in fruit. The fruits of amalaki occupy a prominent place in Ayurveda, well known for its powerful antioxidant effect and for its high content of Vitamin C, several fold that of orange. The drug consists of the fresh and dried fruits. The fruits are listed in the Indian Herbal Pharmaco - poeia, 2002, as antacid. 13 The fruit contains Vitamin C, pectin, a number of poly - phenolic compounds, have been isolated from fresh pericarp of the fruit.15It has been suggested that there is no Vitamin C present in the fruit based on experiments.15 The ethyl acetate-soluble fraction of the methanolic extract of amalaki at 50 mg /H11080kg-1body weight when tested on albino rats showed anti-ulcer and antisecretory activity. In addition, three compoundsactive at 10 mg /H11080kg -1body weight were isolated that prevented stress ulcers in albino rats. The ethyl acetate and the three compoundsshowed H /H11001K/H11001ATPase activity.16Extracts of amalaki have been shown to have a healing effect on peptic ulcer in rats and humans. In a studypublished as abstract, patients with peptic ulcer who received 3 g ofthe drug twice a day after food for 15 days showed endoscopic im - provement. 17 In a pilot study, 20 patients with gastritis syndrome (amlapitta), which is characterized by pain in the epigastric region, nausea, acideructation, and burning sensation in the abdomen, were chosen forthe study. Before the study, patients were kept as in-patients on a re-stricted diet for 5 days and gastric analysis was done on the sixth day,after which therapy was started. Patients were kept on a restrictedbland diet of milk and chapattis \u2014a kind of unleavened bread. Pow- dered amalaki was given to patients at dose of 3 g thrice a day for 7 days. On the eighth day gastric analysis was done to find outchanges in the gastric acidity. Most patients showed relief in symp-toms from the second day with relief in all patients within 2-5 days oftaking the drug. The level of acidity also came back to normal levelsin most of the cases. However, the drug was effective only in cases ofhyperchlorhydria and not in cases with hypochlorhydria. 18 An open comparative trial examined 38 patients with dyspepsia: 10 with ulcer and 28 without ulcer.19Patients were included in the trial if they had at least four of the following nine symptoms for aminimum of 2 weeks during the last 8 weeks prior to the entry intothe study\u2014belching, abdominal distension, feeling of fullness aftermeals, upper gastric burning, heartburn, regurgitation of bitter fluid,nausea, vomiting, and inability to finish normal meals. Parasitic in - fections were excluded by testing. In the ulcer dyspepsia group of10 cases, patients were assigned to one of two treatment groups\u2014fivepatients were given 3 g of amalaki powder three times a day forGastrointestinal Agents 234 weeks and five patients were given 30 ml gel antacid every 3 hour daily for 4 weeks. Endoscopically all five patients in the antacidgroup showed healing, whereas in the amalaki group four out of five patients showed evidence of complete healing. In the nonulcer dyspepsia group with peak acid output between 16 and 40 mEq /H11080h -1patients were again divided into two groups: 15 on antacids and 13 on amalaki .Amalaki produced a significant improve - ment in dyspeptic symptoms and a decrease in acid output, both treat - ment modalities being comparable. Four patients on antacids com - plained of pain and weakness of lower limbs, whereas three patientsonamalaki had vomiting and loose motions controlled in 2 days without stopping the drug. Amalaki is a known mild laxative. It has earlier been suggested 20thatamalaki strengthens the gastric and duo- denal mucosa leading to rapid healing of the ulcers. Considering thehigh tannin content of amalaki this is likely to be the case, with the tannin forming a protective covering allowing the ulcer to heal under-neath. In another preliminary trial 2039 cases of duodenal ulcer and 21 cases of nonulcer dyspepsia were given 3 g of amalaki rasayana with water thrice daily for 10 days initially and subsequently twicedaily. No other drug\u2014antacid, tranquillizer, or anticholinergic drugwas given during this period. Amalaki rasayana is a traditional Ayurvedic preparation obtained by adding a decoction of amalaki to the fruit powder and drying it. This process of adding the decoctionand drying is repeated 21 times. Patients were selected after Bariummeal, X-ray, and the history of their disease. Normal diet was advisedwith restrictions on sour, fried, and very spicy food, large quantitiesof rice and pulses. In cases of intolerable pain, a bland diet of milkand unleavened bread (chapattis) was advised. The duration of the complaint ranged from 6 weeks to 12 years. It was found that therewas marked relief from pain within 2-10 days of treatment in82 percent of the cases. There was also relief in other symptoms likepyrosis, flatulence, reduced appetite, constipation, vomiting, heme - temesis, and melena in a majority of cases. Amalaki fruits are considered safe and have been used for a very long time in India, for their health benefits, in the form of food itemslike pickles, dried fruit powder mixed in yogurt, or just preserved in24 AYURVEDIC HERBShoney. In long-term trials a few patients complained of loose motions and nausea, which was controlled without stopping the drug, attribut - able to the known laxative effect of the amalaki .19The acute and sub - acute toxicity of Emblica officinalis has neither revealed any toxic effect nor was any toxic effect seen on liver and kidney, and it im - proved the phagocytic and killing capacity of monocytes and poly - morphonuclear cells.21No cellular toxicity was seen when added to fresh sheep erythrocytes.22The aqueous extract showed potent antimutagenic activity var. is cultivated throughout India for culinary use. The unripe fruits are commonly cooked and eaten asa vegetable in India. They are also considered to be useful for gastric disorders. 24 Both raw and ripe banana skin and pulp contain 5-hydroxy- tryptamine, with maximum content in raw fruit pulp.25The pulp is rich in flavonoids, mostly leucoanthocyanidins especially leucodel- phinidin and leucocyanidin.26Leucocyanidin obtained from the pulp has been shown to exhibit a significant protective effect againstaspirin-induced ulcers. 27 Banana's antiulcerogenic effect in different small animal models has been summarized28\u2014those using histamine in guinea pigs25,29and mice,30phenylbutazone-induced gastric ulcers in guinea pigs,31,32in restraint ulcers in rats,33,34aspirin-induced gastric ulcer in rats35,36and those using Thai Musa species.37 Banana powder presumably acts by strengthening the mucosal re - sistance against ulcerogens28,38and promotes healing by inducing cell proliferation28and increasing cellular mucus.38To obtain an active powder, drying of the pulp is best done below 40\u00b0C.27An active ex - tract is obtained by extraction with water27,35or aqueous alcohol35at temperatures below 50\u00b0C, beyond which activity is lost. The aqueousGastrointestinal Agents 25extract is rich in leucocyanidin, which is an active compound.27 Other components of green banana like pectin and phosphatidyl choline may protect the gastric mucosa by adding strength to themucous phospholipid layer. 36An ethanol extract increases eico - sanoids accumulation in human gastric mucosa.39The anti-ulcerative activity of banana is influenced by the type of soil, season, maturityand species. 40 An open clinical trial carried out on 24 peptic ulcer patients (2 gas - tric and 22 duodenal ulcer) with radiologically or endoscopicallyconfirmed diagnosis. Banana powder at a dose level of 1 g four timesa day was given half an hour before meals for 12 weeks. A total of19 patients completed the treatment. Of the patients 84 percentshowed symptomatic relief. 41In a double-blind, multicentric study, there was complete healing in 70 percent patients as determinedendoscopically compared to 40 percent in the placebo group. In thetreatment group, 24 percent showed partial healing, whereas no par-tial healing was observed in the placebo group. 42 Green bananas are commonly eaten as a vegetable in India and are considered to be safe without any adverse effects. There appear to beno specific studies on the toxicity of the fruit although some informa-tion is available on the leaf and stem alkali. 43 NOTES 1. Andrew HS.

New Delhi: Indian Council of Medical Research, 1987.28 AYURVEDIC HERBSOTHER ANTIULCER PLANTS The exploratory clinical evaluation of some other plants at Banaras Hindu University have been summarized.1Thus Adhatoda vasica, Eclipta alba, andGlycyrrhiza glabra have been leaves of Adhatoda vasica orvasa are widely used for the treatment of cough, cold, and asthma (see Chapter 5, \"Respiratory tract drugs\"). The plant is reputed in Ayurveda for use in bleeding dis-orders and hence it was tried out in cases of \"amlapitta, \" which was earlier explicated as nonulcer acid dyspepsia in modern parlance. 2 Thus 20 patients of hyperacidity and hyperchlorhydria were treatedas in-patients and given vasa as a syrup\u2014three teaspoons four times a day equivalent to 30 g per day of crude drug in four divided dosesfor 6 weeks. Symptoms were carefully recorded. There was clinicalimprovement and reduction in the free and total gastric acidity, with85 percent responding \"well\" to treatment. The assessment was that 7patients were cured and 10 improved, whereas 3 remained un - changed. 3 Agents 29This plant is well known in Ayurveda for its hepatoprotective ac - tivity and has been covered in Chapter 4 \"Hepatoprotective agents.\" Eclipta alba juice is used as a soaking agent in various Ayurvedic antiulcer preparations. A series of studies were conducted in BanarasHindu University to evaluate the efficacy of the drug in nonulcer dys - pepsia and duodenal ulcer. In an exploratory study, 22 patients with nonulcer dyspepsia and 8 patients with duodenal ulcer were given Eclipta alba whole plant as a syrup in a dose of 20 ml /H11080day /H110021(from 20 g crude drug) in two divided doses for 6 weeks. Of dyspeptic patients 90 percent were cured andimprovement was seen in 87 percent of ulcer patients. 4 As a result of these findings, 60 patients were given 30 g of the whole-plant powder in three divided doses. Thus 35 cases ofnonulcer dyspepsia received the drug for a period of 1 month and25 patients with duodenal ulcer were administered the drug for a pe-riod of 3 months. Most of the patients showed marked symptomaticrelief. Patients with nonulcer dyspepsia were relieved of epigastricpain, nausea, and throat burning, whereas patients with peptic ulcerwere relieved of nocturnal pain, acid reflex and nausea. Both groupsshowed significant reduction in gastric acidity with 80 percent of pa-tients with nonulcer dyspepsia showing good response. Radiologicalimprovement was observed in 75 percent of patients who were fol-lowed up. It was assessed that excellent results were obtained with48 percent of patients with duodenal ulcer. 5However, considering the small number of patients, the large dosage of 30 g of drug used, andgiven the fact that Eclipta alba contains wedelolactone that is a po - tent 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, further studies are needed to evaluate the usefulness of the drug. 6Subsequently, in another study the same dosage of 30 g of whole-plant powder was given to 35 cases with du - odenal ulcer for a period of 3-6 months and found to be effective in60 percent of the cases. 7 glabra are commonly used in Ayurveda in cough remedies, skin preparations, and in combina - tion with other plants for the treatment of ulcer. The drug is approved in the Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia, 2002, for its anti-inflammatory activity and its antiulcer effect.8The major constituents9,10are the triterpenoid glycyrrhizin, which is the sweet-tasting calcium and po - tassium salt of glycyrrhizic acid and numerous flavonoids, of whichliquiritin is the major constituent that on hydrolysis yields liquiriti - genin and isoliquiritigenin. In a study on 10 cases of nonulcer dyspepsia and 15 cases of peptic ulcer ,2go fdrug powder was given thrice daily for 1 month to the nonulcer dyspepsia group and 3 g thrice a day was given for 3 monthsto the peptic ulcer group. There was considerable symptomatic im-provement and reduction in gastric acidity. In the nonulcer dyspepsiagroup, 30 percent showed excellent response and 30 percent showedgood response. Most patients of peptic ulcer showed more than50 percent radiological improvement, in addition to reduction in duo-denal spasm and other symptomatic improvement. 11,12 Extracts of Glycyrrhiza glabra were tested for antiulcerogenic ac- tivity against indomethacin-induced gastric ulcers in rats and theirantisecretory and cytoprotective activity. The extract showed a dose-dependent antiulcerogenic activity associated with a reduced acidoutput and an increased mucin secretion, an increase in prostaglandinE 2release and a decrease in leukotriene. It has been suggested that the cytoprotective effect may be due to the flavonoids present, which actas free radical scavengers. 13The flavonoids glabridin and glabrene in- hibited in vitro the of Helicobacter pylori .14 The use of Glycyrrhiza glabra can cause water retention, edema, and an increase in the blood pressure because of its corticosteroidaleffect. This effect is due to deficiency or inhibition of 11-/H9252 -hydroxy - steroid of glycyrrhetinic acid, 3-monogl - curonylglycyrrhetinic acid,16as a result of which cortisol levels in - crease in the kidney. In other parts of the world the use of degly - cyrrhinated licorice (with glycyrrhizin removed) is preferred for thetreatment of ulcers. Its use is not recommended for patients with highblood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes, problems with the kidneyGastrointestinal Agents 31or liver, and for periods exceeding 4-6 weeks. Recommended average daily doses of crude root range from 5 to15 g corresponding to 200-800 mg of glycyrrhizin. 17In Ayurveda licorice is generally combined with other plants in antiulcer preparations and therefore dosage is re - duced to lower and hence safer levels. This was also noted in the trial of Revers,18who noted that 20 per - cent of peptic ulcer patients treated with a paste containing 40 percentlicorice suffered from edema, which disappeared on discontinuationof the drug.

Geneva: World Health Organization, INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are two chronic inflamma - tory bowel diseases whose incidence is increasing in the West. Seen mostly in young adults,1it is the cause of much morbidity. It is be - lieved that the increased formation of the inflammatory mediators known as leukotrienes plays an important role in causing and main - taining chronic inflammation. Therefore attempts have been made tofind specific inhibitors of leukotriene synthesis. However, such prod - ucts, on evaluation showed unsuitable attributes like poor bio - availability, susceptibility to oxidation, side effects and were toxic. 2 The gum resin of the tree Boswellia serrata, shown to be a specific in - hibitor of leukotriene synthesis, is used in Ayurveda in a variety ofinflammatory Plate 2 in color gallery) is a medium-sized, deciduous tree that grows to a height of 17 m found throughout India in the dry hilly forests. The gum resin is foundunder the bark and is obtained by peeling the bark or by making anincision and allowing the gum to flow out, which is collected after1 month. 4The gum resin from the tree has been prescribed in Ayurveda for a variety of inflammatory conditions. It is used in rheu-matism, skin diseases, asthma, diarrhea, and dysentery, etc. 5,6 The gum resin contains essential oil, terpenoids, and gum. The active portion of the gum resin are the boswellic acids\u2014 /H9252-boswellic acid, acetyl- /H9252-boswellic acid, and especially what are now considered the main active principles 11-keto- /H9252-boswellic acid and acetyl-11-keto- /H9252- boswellic acid.7 In be a useful anti-inflam- matory and antiarthritic drug. The gum resin shows a potent analge-sic and sedative effect in small animals. 8The alcoholic extract of salai guggul has a marked anti-inflammatory effect in rats and mice.9 The alcoholic extract, as shown later by Ammon et al., inhibits for - mation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) acids more specifically acetyl-11-keto- /H9252-boswellic acid (AKBA) was found to be the most active in inhibiting leukotriene synthesis.7They act by binding to a pentacyclic triterpene selective effector site, thereby in - hibiting 5-lipoxygenase, and in turn inhibiting the synthesis ofleukotrienes, while having no action on the synthesis of prosta - glandins. 11Apart from the inhibition of leukotriene synthesis, there is inhibition of leukocyte elastase, which causes damage in arthritis.12 In an experimental model of inflammatory bowel disease in rats,Boswellia extract or AKBA was seen to cause significant reduction34 AYURVEDIC HERBSof inflammation associated with indomethacin administration.13In addition, boswellic acids have been shown to inhibit the complement system, which is another inflammatory mediator.14 Boswellic acids are selective and specific inhibitors of leukotriene synthesis. Therefore, they can be useful in a number of disease condi - tions in which increased leukotriene formation is considered to causeand perpetuate inflammation, for example polyarthritis and bronchialasthma, and inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn's disease,chronic colitis, and ulcerative colitis. They have also been used totreat edema associated with certain brain tumors like astrocytomaand glioma. These conditions have been clinically evaluated and are covered in the relevant chapter. Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and chronic co-litis are covered in this chapter. Asthma is covered in Chapter 5, arthri-tis is covered in Chapter 8 \"Anti-rheumatic agents,\" and the brain tu-mor edema trials are covered in Chapter 13. Other disease conditionsin which enhanced leukotriene synthesis plays a role are sclerosis, lupus erthyromatosus, These not yet been clinicallyevaluated. Crohn's disease In a randomized double blind trial, 15102 patients were treated with theBoswellia extract H15 or mesalazine for 8 weeks. A detailed his- tory was recorded before start of the trial and clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters were noted. Patients also maintained a diaryregarding their health, stool frequency and consistency, and occur-rence of stomach pain based on which their status was evaluated us - ing Crohn Disease Activity (CDA) index. Eighty-three patients com - pleted the study, of which 44 patients received one 400 mg tabletcontaining a standardized Boswellia serrata extract three times a day. In the comparative group, 33 patients received thrice daily 1,500 mgmesalazine. Patients were followed up every 2 weeks by checking thediary entries and by determination of the CDA index. The improvement in the CDA index was definitely better in the case of the Boswellia serrata extract, however, when computed sta - tistically, was not significant. The side-effect profile of BoswelliaGastrointestinal Agents 35serrata was better than mesalazine, with four infections in the case of Boswellia serrata as compared to eight with mesalazine. Considering that treatment with mesalazine is considered state-of-the-art treat - ment for Crohn's disease and that the Boswellia extract is as good as mesalazine, with a better side-effect profile, treatment with Boswellia extract H15 must be evaluated better than mesalazine based on the fa - vorable benefit-risk advantage that it offers. There are certain other substances in Salai guggul that enhance leukotriene synthesis and worsen the clinical picture. Therefore, the intake of Salai guggul extracts needs to be supervised by a doctor. In addition, there is in vitro evidence that there is a concentration-de - pendent inhibition or potentiation of 5-lipoxygenase.16 Ulcerative colitis Ulcerative colitis is a nonspecific chronic inflammatory disease of the bowel, which can attack the entire colon from the rectum up-wards. Usually, however, it is the lateral part of the intestines that isaffected. With no cure, episodes of acute phase alternate with periodsof remission. The disease is characterized by blood in the stools,pain, etc. It is treated with steroids in the acute phase and 5-amino-salicylic acid derivatives in the remission phase and also during theacute phase. 17 In an open study, patients with ulcerative colitis grade II and III were treated with 350 mg Boswellia serrata extract thrice daily or 1 g sulfasalazine thrice daily for 6 weeks. There was marked reduction inloose motions, mucous in stool, blood in stool, and abdominal pain.Improvement was also seen in the inflammatory appearance of the in-testinal mucosa\u2014in crypts, abscess, and erosion of the mucosa. A to - tal of 30 patients were examined in the Boswellia group. Results in both arms of the trial were comparable, with 82 percent remission inthe resin group and 75 percent in the sulfasalazine group. 18 Chronic colitis Chronic colitis is a variant of ulcerative colitis characterized by vague lower abdominal pain, rectal bleeding with diarrhea, and tenderpalpable colon. In an open nonrandomized clinical trial, 30 patients36 AYURVEDIC HERBSwith chronic colitis were included in the study. Twenty patients re - ceived 300 mg of a preparation from Boswellia serrata gum resin thrice daily for 6 weeks, and ten patients received 1 g of sulfasalazine thrice daily for 6 weeks and served as controls. Of the 20 patients onBoswellia 18 showed improvement, while in the control group six out of ten patients showed improvement. The remission rate was 14 outof 20 for Boswellia and it was four out of ten in the sulfasalazine group. 19 The LD50of an alcoholic extract was greater than 2 g/H11080kg/H110021body weight. No significant effect was seen on the cardiovascular, respira - tory, and central nervous systems.10In a chronic study with controls on monkeys using the defatted alcoholic extract of Boswellia serrata at three dose levels, namely at two, five, and ten times the ED50for 6 months, was found not to produce any biochemical, hematological,and histopathological toxicity. 20In a small percentage of patients, gastrointestinal side effects like heart burn and hyperacidity are seenthat increase with increasing dosage. 21Also seen is skin irritation.21 In the clinical study on ulcerative colitis with a dose of 350 mg thrice daily for 6 weeks 6 patients out of 34 patients complained ofheart burn and loss of appetite. In the bronchial asthma trial (seeChapter 5) with 300 mg thrice daily 2 out of 40 patients complainedof epigastric pain, nausea and hyperacidity. In the glioblastoma trial(see Chapter 13, section \"Cancer therapy,\" note 18) with increaseddosages up to 1,200 mg thrice daily some patients complained ofnausea and vomiting and two patients complained of skin irritation,which was reversible on stoppage. In the trial with children, no side ef-fects were seen when they received a maximum dose of 126 mg/H11080kg /H110021 bodyweight (see Chapter 13, section \"Cancer therapy,\" note 20) andalso in the trial also Chapter13, section \"Cancer ther - 37formation in stimulated PMNL.

ANTIEMETIC AGENTS Nausea and vomiting can arise from indigestion, motion sickness, as a side effect of medicines used in cancer chemotherapy, in preg - nancy in the form of morning sickness, anticipatory nausea, infec - tions, certain internal endocrinological and neurological disorders, and after surgery.1In allopathic medicine, depending on the cause of nausea, different drugs are employed. Some of the drugs used tocombat nausea are antihistaminic in nature and therefore causedrowsiness and loss of alertness. However, ginger has been shown tohave wide-ranging antiemetic effects, (dry) English: Ginger Ginger is widely used in Ayurveda for its antiemetic effects. Fresh ginger is cut into small bits and taken along with honey, or fresh gin- ger juice is combined with lime and/or lemon juice in the form ofsyrup and taken to treat morning sickness. There is concern in Ger - many that ginger could cause problems in pregnancy not only because of the reported mutagenicity of ginger in certain test systems 2but also because of the possibility of testosterone binding.3There are also re - ports that ginger has antimutagenic potential.2 Motion and sea sickness The first reports of the use of ginger in motion sickness, caused by a motorized revolving chair, observed that 940 mg of pow - dered ginger root proved more effective than 100 mg DramamineGastrointestinal Agents 39(dimenhydrinate) in reducing the gastrointestinal effects of motion sickness without the drowsiness caused by Dramamine. The studyconcluded that ginger was acting directly on the gastrointestinal tractincreasing gastrointestinal motility and absorption of neutralizingtoxins and acids, and not by its central action on the vomiting center. 4 The use of powdered ginger as a prophylactic in seasickness has been studied in a double-blind randomized study with 80 cadets. One gram of ginger powder as a single dose was statistically better thanplacebo in reducing the incidence of vomiting and cold sweating 4 hours after ingestion. 5In another trial with 1,741 volunteers, ginger powder when compared with seven other OTC and prescription antiemetic drugs proved equally effective as the tested drugs.6 Other studies7-10that investigated the effect of ginger on motion sickness have been divided in their opinion as to the effectiveness ofthe prophylactic use of ginger root in preventing nausea and vomit-ing. The varying results could arise from the variable quality or, as has been suggested, 11because of the different focus in the trials\u2014thus trials, which looked at the gastrointestinal effects reported better re- sults as compared with trials that looked at the response of the centralnervous system. 11Positive results have been obtained using a stan- dardized ginger root powder in two double-blind studies12,13one trial being conducted in children in the age group of four to eight years,who were susceptible to motion sickness when travelling in a bus,train, or on the merry-go-round. Doses were varied from 250 to 500 mg of ginger depending upon the age of the children and given half an hour before travel and repeated if necessary every 4 hours. 13 Hyperemesis gravidarum In a double-blind randomized crossover trial 250 mg powdered ginger four times a day for 4 days was compared against placebogiven in a similar capsule also four times a day to 30 patients suffer - ing from severe morning sickness admitted to the hospital. Nineteenpatients evaluated both on subjective and objective parameters showed that ginger was significantly better than placebo in reducing or eliminating the symptoms of hyperemesis gravidarum. 1440 AYURVEDIC HERBSPostoperative nausea In two randomized double-blind studies, 60 and 120 patients, re - spectively, received before the operation, a single dose of 10 mg metoclopramide, placebo, or 0.5 g15or 1 g16powdered ginger, inci - dence of nausea and vomiting was reduced to similar extents inmetoclopramide and ginger and much less when compared to pla - cebo. 15,16Also, patients receiving ginger needed fewer postoperative antiemetics.16However, another double-blind clinical study con - cluded that ginger prepared according to the British pharmacopoeiawas ineffective in reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting. 17 Drug-induced nausea Psoralens are taken before undergoing photophoresis. In 11 pa- tients who regularly experienced nausea after ingestion of 8-metho-xypsoralen (8-MOP), were treated with three 530 mg capsules of gin-ger powder taken prior to administration of 8-MOP experiencedsignificantly reduced nausea. 18 In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial with leuke- mia patients who regularly took prochlorperazine when undergoingchemotherapy, the addition of ginger reduced both the time and theintensity of nausea when taking prochlorperazine alone, althoughthere was no difference in the vomiting. 19 Cisplatin, which is used in cancer chemotherapy, induces nausea, vom- iting, and delay in gastric emptying. Experimentally acetone and alcoholicextracts of ginger has been shown to significantly reduce cisplatin-in-duced nausea in dogs. 20In rats, ginger juice, acetone and 50 percent ethanolic extract have been shown to significantly reverse cisplatin-induced gastric emptying, with the reversal caused by the acetone extractbeing similar to odansetron that is usually used for this purpose. 21 NOTES 1.

LAXATIVES In Ayurveda it is considered important to maintain a healthy colon for which a number of laxatives are used. In fact, it is considered nec- essary to have a clean colon before attempting to administer drugs inorder for drugs to be effective and especially before attempting theso-called rejuvenation treatment that has its own rules and regula-tions to be complied with. Thus before the actual process of rejuvena-tion is started there is a lengthy cleansing process that is undertaken.The most commonly used laxatives are psyllium seed and husk,senna leaves and pods, castor oil and chebulic myrobalan either by it-self or together with belleric a small shrub, which is grown for its leaves and pods that have a cathartic action, the pods having a milder effectthan the leaves. The use of Cassia angustifolia, indigenous to North Africa, was introduced, by Arabian physicians, into Europe andIndia. 1Interaction of Ayurvedic physicians with Unani physicians in medieval times led to the introduction of the plant into the Ayurvedicmateria medica. The British introduced the plant for cultivationGastrointestinal Agents 43sometime in the early nineteenth century. It is cultivated extensively in South India, especially in the Tinnevely (Tirunelveli) district ofTamil Nadu, with estimates of 6,000 tons of senna leaves and podsbeing produced and exported. 2Both leaves and pods are approved in the US and German pharmacopoeia, and several other pharmacopoe - ias for their laxative action. Apart from its laxative action, it is con - sidered useful in Ayurveda for skin problems.3 Senna's laxative action is due to the anthraquinone glycosides present, mainly sennoside A and B, which are converted by the normalintestinal bacteria into the active constituent rhein anthrone, whichstimulates peristalsis and evacuation. 4 Clinical studies with standardized senna have shown its utility in long-term therapy of habitually constipated patients,5although it is presently recommended only for short-term treatment of constipa-tion. Standardized senna preparation has also been tried in the treat-ment of constipation immediately after delivery 6with average suc- cess rate of over 93-96 percent as compared to 51-59 percent withplacebo. Mild cramping was seen in those treated with senna as com-pared to 4 percent with placebo. In this trial there was no evidence ofthe commonly held view that senna causes diarrhea in breastfedbabies when the mother takes senna as laxative. In combination with psyllium, senna (6.5 g /H110011.5 g/H11080 day /H110021) provided better relief (63 percent) as regards stool frequency and weight whencompared to psyllium (7.2 g/H11080day /H110021; 48 percent).7In terminal cancer patients being treated with opioids, senna was found to be as effectiveas lactulose with similar adverse effect profile but senna was pre-ferred because it was more cost effective. 8In children below 15 years of age who were constipated, lactulose was preferred over senna.Twenty-one children in a crossover trial received either lactulose orsenna in the first week followed by a wash-out period with no treat - ment and the alternative treatment in the third week. Normal stoolswere significantly better with lactulose and the side effects reportedby senna were greater. 9 Senna preparations have been found useful in readying patients for colonoscopy either by exclusively10or in addition to the usual lavage.11 One study did not find any advantage in using senna.1244 AYURVEDIC HERBSSenna pods cause less griping because of lower sennosides con - tent. Other drugs of Cassia species like the fruit pulp of Cassia fistula are also used as laxative. It is considered a safe drug because of its milder action. This is due to the fact that it contains lower concentra - tion of sennoside A and B, rhein and, other anthraquinones.13Senna is preferred for short-term therapy; long-term use is to be avoided be - cause of the possible mutagenic role of anthraquinones. Plantago Plantago ovata is a stemless, hairy, annual herb found growing in northwest India and cultivated in certain regions of Gujarat, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh.14Indigenous to the Mediterranean region, it is not found in the early texts of Ayurveda, but was later introduced into In-dia. It was first reported in the Ayurvedic text Vaidyamrta written in the late eighteenth century by Vaidyaraja Moneswara for the treat-ment of fever due to diarrhea, and subsequently finds mention in nu-merous Ayurvedic texts for treatment of intestinal complaints. 15The seeds are listed in the Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia, 2002, as a bulk forming laxative and antidiarrhoeal agent.16The seed husk is also used as a laxative since it separates readily from the seed and is thepart which contains the mucilage. Plantago ovata seeds contain 20-30 percent of mucilage, which is found in the outer seed coat or husk and is composed of arabin - oxylans. In addition, the seed contains fixed oil, protein, and smallamounts of aucubin\u2014an iridoid glycoside. 17,18When the seeds are put in water, the mucilage swells rapidly and takes up several times itsvolume, the bulk helping peristalsis and evacuation. An unfermentedgel component of the seed husk provides lubrication and thereby pro - motes laxation in humans. 19The seed husk also contains an active principle-exhibiting acetylcholine-like action.20Gastrointestinal Agents 45A number of clinical studies have confirmed the mild laxative ac - tion of psyllium husk in the treatment of chronic constipation, irrita - ble bowel syndrome, and constipation due to diverticulitis. An early open clinical study showed that 13.5 g of psyllium husk improvedstool frequency in a 4-week study with 65 patients with an averagestool frequency of less than three hard motions per week to 74 per - cent having a motion every 1-2 days after 4 weeks of treatment. 21 Another placebo-controlled randomized 8-week study evaluated the effect of psyllium on stool characteristics, colon transit, andanorectal function in chronic idiopathic constipation. After a run-in pe - riod of 4 weeks, 22 patients were assigned to one of two groups\u201411patients received5gp s y llium twice a day, and 11 patients received placebo for 8 weeks. Patients maintained a diary to record daily stoolfrequency, difficulty in defecation, and weekly stool weight. Therewas significant improvement in stool frequency and stool weight. Inaddition there was improvement in stool consistency and pain on def-ecation. 22 Other studies have compared psyllium alone (7.2 g) and a combi- nation of senna and psyllium (1.5 /H110016.5 g).23Both laxatives improved stool frequency and consistency. Objectively assessed on the basis ofstool frequency and weight, laxation was achieved by 63 percent ofthe combination group, whereas with psyllium alone it was 48 per-cent. Psyllium has also been compared with lactulose 24and methylcellulose,25docusate sodium26and with placebo.27Isabgol husk was effective for the treatment of simple constipation andachieved better stool consistency and fewer side effects when com-pared to lactulose. 24Psyllium was also found superior to docusate so - dium in laxative efficacy.26 In a double-blind crossover study in 26 patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) the effect of ispaghula husk was studiedagainst placebo for 6 weeks. 28Fifty percent of patients receiving ispaghula reported improvement as against 23 percent of patientswho were on placebo. Results were better in patients with spastic co - litis, little effect being seen in patients with mucous diarrhea. Anotherstudy with ispaghula in IBS in combination with marmelos and Bacopa monnieri is AYURVEDIC HERBSThe long-term safety and tolerability of ispaghula husk was also studied in 93 healthy subjects for 52 weeks, the study dosage being 10.5 g per day as long-term treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Themajority of adverse effects were of minor nature and of short dura - tion. 29However, the seeds contain allergenic protein that can cause al - lergic reactions by inhalation to the worker during processing of theproduct and also to the user when spooning the husk into the glass forconsumption. 18,30In the carefully prepared seed husk these proteins are absent. Occasionally, abdominal pain has been reported due todistention and flatulence. In cases of intestinal obstruction the use ofpsyllium is to be avoided. seed oil or castor oil has been used in Ayurveda since the time of Caraka and Sushruta as laxative and forthe treatment of rheumatism. The oil is used externally for achingjoints. When taken internally for constipation it also helps relievejoint pain and soothe the nervous system (See also Chapter 8 \"Anti-inflammatory agents). Therefore, it is often added to formulationsto treat pain, nervous disorders, and menstrual irregularities. 31It has been a very commonly used household remedy as a laxative withone or two drops being given even to month-old infants as a laxativetill its use fell into disrepute. Castor oil is listed as a stimulant ca - thartic, lactagogue, and antirheumatic in the Indian herbal pharma - copoeia . 32 Castor grows throughout India. Two varieties are known\u2014one with green stem and the other with red stem. The seed contains the highlypoisonous lectin, ricin. The oil is cold-pressed below 40/H11034 Ct op r e v e n tt h e toxic ricin from being carried over to the oil. The seed contains 40-50percent oil, which is composed up to 80 percent of triricinolein, which isGastrointestinal Agents 47hydrolyzed in the small intestine to glycerol and ricinoleic acid, which is the laxative agent.33Ricinoleic acid increases fluid secretion, releases nitric oxide, increases mucosal permeability and cytotoxicity and dis - rupts normal intestinal motility.34 The oil is generally used only for a short duration with doses of 10- 30 ml being used for adults. There are a number of trials confirmingthe efficacy of castor oil when given in doses of 15-60 ml and this hasbeen reviewed. 35 In a double-blind randomized study, the effectiveness of 0.6 g cas - tor oil in soft gelatin capsules in doses of 1.2, 2.4, and 3.6 g per daywas compared with 150 mg senna extract equivalent to 25 mg sen-nosides also in soft gelatin capsules. There were four runs of 1-weekduration each and one to two washout periods. The aim of the studywas to reach at least five motions per week with the minimum dosepossible both for castor oil and for senna. In 15 patients (50 percent)bowel function was normalized with two castor oil capsules (1.2 g)per day, 13 patients required two capsules twice a day (2.4 g) to getthe desired effect whereas in two patients the maximum dosage of 3.6g was needed. With the senna extract (two capsules) 28 patientsachieved normalization of bowel function. However, there were noside effects observed with castor oil capsules, whereas seven patientshad cramps in the lower abdomen with senna. The stools were alwaysof a soft well-formed mass with castor oil leading to a preference forthe castor oil preparation. 36 In another study, 75 doctors took part where the trial medication was 1 g castor oil in soft gelatin capsules. A total of 168 patientswere observed up to 14 days each. A single intake of three to fivecapsules once in the morning was recommended. By the end ofthe observation period, the medication was evaluated by the partici - pating doctors as being \"good\" to \"very good\" in 97 percent of pa - tients. 37 The safety and usage of castor oil has been extensively reviewed.35 With normal dosages no side effects are observed; however, in sensi - tive individuals stomach irritation may arise and larger doses can giverise to nausea, vomiting, cramps, and purgation. With dosages of 2-3ml in more than 200 patients no side effects found growing throughout India in deciduous forests. The drug consists of the dried rind of mature fruits; the color varies from yellowish brown to brown to black depending upon the source. The drug is approved in the In- dian Herbal Pharmacopoeia, 2002, as a laxative and astringent.38 The name haritaki is derived from the Sanskrit word hara (to con- quer). The fruits are traditionally considered to be useful for a num- ber of conditions: laxative, stomachic, and tonic.39The fruits are best known for their laxative properties either alone or in combinationknown as triphala or three fruits\u2014with the fruits . Depending upon the dosage, haritaki is used as a laxative or to control diarrhea. The fruit flesh is a rich source of tannins (32-34 percent). 39Major constituents include polyphenolics such as chebulinic acid, chebulagicacid, chebulic acid, gallic acid, and ellagic acid and anthraquinones. Some of the other minor constituents include other polyphenolics like corilagin and galloylglucose, sugars like glucose and sorbitol, fla-vonoids, triterpene glycosides, amino acids, and some other acids. 38 Haritaki is very widely used in Ayurveda as a laxative and has been shown clinically to be useful in cases of simple constipation.40 Experimentally, haritaki has been shown to significantly increase gastric emptying41-43comparable to metoclopramide.41The laxative principle has variously been suggested to be the oil from the fruit44 and an anthraquinone glycoside similar to sennoside A.45 In a preliminary trial, 10 patients were admitted as in-patients and underwent hematological, biochemical, and radiological investiga - tions to check for absence of pathology. Symptoms evaluated were frequency of stools, consistency, completeness of evacuation, andGastrointestinal Agents 49minor disturbances like flatulence, mild abdominal pain, and dimin - ished appetite. Six grams of powder of dried ripe fruits of the big vari - ety of Terminalia chebula known as bari harar was given at bedtime after meals for 7 days. A daily progress record of the patients was maintained noting changes in symptoms. There was gradual reduc - tion in complaints starting from the day after the start of therapy. Atthe end of 7 days, incomplete evacuation and reduced frequencyhad improved in all patients with improvement in consistency, flatu - lence, and difficulty in evacuation. Total response to the treatmentwas evaluated as \"excellent\" in 20 percent and \"good\" in 80 percentof patients. 40 Traditionally, the drug haritaki is considered to be safe and better than a mother since it does not have adverse effects.40In the clinical trial conducted no side effects were seen.40No toxicity was seen in acute and subacute studies.46Also studied was the effect on liver and renal function parameters and the phagocytic and killing capacity ofmonocytes and polymorphonuclear cells. 46The tannin fraction from Terminalia chebula Calcutta: Academic Publishers, 1958.

DIARRHEA Diarrhea is very common in India, especially the ones due to bac - terial and protozoal infections. Thus infections like amoebiasis and giardiasis caused by protozoa and bacterial infections caused byEscherichia coli andVibrio cholerae are common. It is also a major cause of morbidity and mortality and a large number of plants havebeen used in Ayurveda for control of diarrhea and dysentery. is a medium-sized tree and all parts including root, bark, leaves, fruits, and root bark are used as medicine. However, it is the fruit that is most commonly used. The ripe fruit is considered an excel-lent laxative, whereas the unripe or half-ripe fruit is used for the treat - ment of chronic diarrhea and dysentery. In India, Aegle marmelos was so commonly used by Western doctors during the British rule that it foundits way into the British pharmacopoeia. It is official in the Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia, 2002, as an antidiarrheal agent. 1 The fruit contains large quantities of pectin, apart from alkaloids, sterols, and coumarins that have also been isolated. (3-15 mg\u00b7animal/H110021) and 50 percent ethanolic3extract (100-200 mg\u00b7kg/H110021) of the unripe fruit has been found to exhibit an antidiarrheal effect insmall animals. A few clinical studies have been reported with preparations of un - ripe fruit. The syrup made from the fruits (Sharbat-e-Bael), aUnani preparation, which also uses the fruits, was studied at a dose level of54 AYURVEDIC HERBS25 ml thrice a day for seven days in a number of cases of acute diar - rhea and dysentery.4 In an open trial, 5 g of unripe fruit powder was given thrice daily to 25 patients of chronic dysentery for 21 days. Fifty-two percent of the patients were completely cured, 44 percent showed improvement,and 4 percent remained unaffected. 5 In a study, the effect of unripe fruit on intestinal parasites was tried out clinically and it was concluded that the drug was effective againstGiardia, Entamoeba histolytica, andAscaris lumbricoides. 6Twelve grams of the unripe fruit pulp was given in cases of intestinalamoebiasis in three divided doses for 15 days with the response being\"excellent\" in 81 percent of the cases. 7In a randomized double-blind comparative trial to test the efficacy of dried unripe fruit powder incases of shigellosis (dysentery caused by Shigella ) it was not found useful, since it did not cause clinical improvement or bacteriologicalcure as compared to ampicillin. 8 In another randomized double-blind clinical trial for 6 weeks with 169 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a combination ofAegle marmelos andBacopa monnieri was evaluated and isaphagulla) and pla-cebo. The Ayurvedic combination that was tried out in 57 patients waseffective in 64.9 percent, whereas the standard therapy in 60 patients waseffective in 78.3 percent. There was a 32.7 percent improvement in theplacebo group of 52 patients. The Ayurvedic combination was moreuseful in diarrhea, whereas the standard therapy was useful in the painfulform of IBS. However, follow-up for 6 months showed similar rates ofrelapse for both treatment forms as compared to placebo. 9 The fruit of Aegle marmelos is edible and widely consumed as fruit, despite the hard outer shell of some varieties, or as a fruit drinkmade with pulp and sugar syrup for its useful action on the stomach, 10 especially in Bengal. a common weed with aromatic tubers found growing throughout India. The root tuber is commonly used for diarrhea, dysentery, dyspepsia, indigestion, and piles.11The tubers contain 0.5-0.9 percent of an essential oil containing sesquiterpenes,/H9252-sitosterol, and a flavonol glycoside. 12The acetone and alcoholic extracts have shown broad spectrum antibacterial activity.13 Twenty patients with chronic diarrhea of more than 3 weeks dura - tion, or those in which there was early recurrence after an acute at - tack, were given 2 g of fine powder of Cyperus rotundus root tuber thrice daily along with 50 ml decoction made from 50 g tuber powdergiven daily for 15 days. The frequency of defecation was controlledby the fifth day of treatment. In addition it helped decrease fatmalabsorption and improved lactose intolerance. Forty percent ofpatients were considered cured, whereas there was improvement in30 percent. 14Further work is required to confirm and expand the scope of use. Cyperus rotundus is generally considered safe and often used to treat stomach complaints in children. In commonly used doses of 1-3 gtwice daily no adverse reactions have been small tree found growing through - out India up to 1,200 m elevation. The stem bark is best known as asingle drug for the treatment of diarrhea and dysentery, althoughother parts like the seeds and leaves are also used medicinally. Thebark contains up to 4 percent alkaloids, of which conessine has beenshown to exhibit potent amoebicidal activity. Other constituents in - clude gum, resin, like lupeol kutaja bark has been summarized.17Kutaja decoction has also been studied in vitro for its activity against diarrhea producing strains of Esche - richia coli and found to be effective.18 In an open trial, 40 patients of amoebiasis and/or giardiasis were treated with 4 g of kutaja bark powder in three divided daily doses for 15 days. Cysts were cleared in 70 percent of patients with intestinal amoebiasis (15), whereas all patients showed good clinical improve - ment. A few patients complained of burning sensation in the abdo - men, feet, and head, which was reversible on stopping the drug.19 Holarrhena antidysentrica is generally considered safe in doses of 2-4 g twice a day.20However, in the clinical trial on amoebiasis, side effects were burning in the abdomen, feet, and head, which subsided on stopping the drug.19In a study to assess side effects in 11 patients, the drug produced subjective symptoms and lowering of blood pres-sure in three patients. 21However, alcoholic extract of Holarrhena antidysentrica showed no cellular toxicity when tested against fresh sheep erythrocytes.22 In a country like India, where amoebiasis and diarrhea are wide- spread, kutaja bark powder or in the form of the preparation known as kutajarista, which is well tolerated, in which the drug is extracted by self-generated alcohol, deserves to be further deciduous tree found growing in forests throughout India. The fruit rind is extensively used in Ayurveda. It is a constituent of the three-fruit combination known as triphala that is very commonly used as a laxative and bowel tonic and, depending upon the dosage, also finds application in control of diarrhea. Bahera is listed in the Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia, 2002, as expectorant, hypolipidemic, and laxative. Depending upon the doseGastrointestinal Agents 57administered it also finds use in control of diarrhea. It is a rich source (~17 percent) of phenolic acids and tannins from which gallic acid, ethyl gallate, galloyl glucose, and chebulagic acid havebeen isolated. 23 In vitro, the alcoholic extract of the fruit also has shown amoebicidal and bactericidal activity against a wide range of bacteriaand is considered promising in various forms of dysentery. 24This ex - tract was found to be better than chloramphenicol. As a follow-up to the promising in vitro results, the drug was evalu - ated clinically and 25 patients were included in an exploratory study,which took place in five different clinics. Patients were given either 1-2tablets containing 150 mg per tablet of methanolic extract of Terminalia belerica fruit pericarp or placebo thrice a day for 14 days. Doctors were allowed to stop treatment depending upon response and to vary the dosefrom 1 tablet thrice a day to 2 tablets thrice a day depending upon sever-ity. There were 12 patients on drug and 10 on placebo. All patients ondrug responded to therapy and required 12 tablets for recovery. No sideeffects were observed. Patients on the drug who were found positive forcysts and bacteria became negative, whereas those patients on placebocontinued to be positive even after the seventh day. 25Considering the re- sults of this trial it needs to be extended to larger number of patients, es-pecially since Terminalia belerica is such a common drug, which would prove useful if the results can be confirmed. Terminalia belerica is generally regarded as safe in the recom- mended dosages of 0.75-1.5 gram of the fruit powder taken twice aday. 26Alcoholic extract of Terminalia belerica showed no cellular toxicity when tested against fresh sheep erythrocytes.22 NOTES 1.Indian herbal pharmacopoeia (rev. new edn., Manufacturers' 2002. 2.

Thus, the liver is susceptibleto a number of disorders because of this multifunctionality and con-stant exposure to toxins. Liver disorders such as hepatitis, hepatosis,and cirrhosis are a major cause of morbidity. Therefore, agents thatcan protect the liver from damage and help alleviate an already dam-aged liver would play an important role in health care, especiallysince no satisfactory remedy exists in modern allopathic medicine. PLANT USE IN AYURVEDA The importance of a healthy liver was realized long ago in India. Plants have been used for centuries in the Indian system of medicine,Ayurveda, for the treatment of liver disorders. In the classical recipes,several plants were combined in a preparation to be used as a remedy.The first recorded medical treatise on Ayurveda\u2014the Caraka Samhita \u2014 dated to 700 BC describes the use of several multiplant preparationsfor the treatment of jaundice and other liver disorders. 1 Plant combinations are still the most popular form of plant remedy today: be it the classical formulae based on traditional Ayurvedictexts or the newer proprietary formulations based on Ayurvedicconcepts. It is in only in the past few years that a few single-plant \u00a9 2006 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1300/5683_04 61remedies have been introduced in the market. However, single plants have always been commonly used as home remedies\u2014the most pop - ular ones being those approximately 40 hepatoprotective multiplant propri- etary products available in the Indian market derived from some 93plants belonging to 44 families. 1Of these plants many have been studied individually to determine their chemical composition and tofind out their pharmacological action. However, only a few of theseplants have been tried out clinically. Most of the trials have been opentrials using few patients. In early trials on viral hepatitis, viral mark-ers were not examined. Double-blind placebo-controlled trials havebeen of experimental studies have been carried out on individual plants to test for hepatoprotective activity. A survey of lit - erature published between 1986 and 1993 has reviewed the data on43 plants used in India and elsewhere, of these 24, which includedfour combinations, showed hepatoprotective activity. 2Emerging trends in the field of hepatoprotective plant drugs have been reviewedand several other reviews have been published, apart from a mono - graph that covers work on Ayurvedic plant drugs for liver diseases. 3-7 Hepatoprotective plants that are interesting because of a combina - tion of factors such as wide usage, traditional use, experimental, andclinical studies (see Plate 3 in color gallery) is a small herb found in the tropical and subtropical parts of India. The plant is included in the multiplant preparations mentioned in the Caraka Samhita .8It has been traditionally used for the following conditions: for sluggish liver; as an antidote to poisons; in cases of colic, dysen - tery, dyspepsia, fever; and in general debility.9The drug comprises the dried aerial parts of the plant: mostly leaves and stem. It has an in-tensely bitter taste, which is usually masked by the addition ofaromatics. It is also one of the most widely used plants in Ayurvedicformulations for liver disorders, being found in 26 of 40 multiplantpreparations. 10Andrographis paniculata orkalmegh, the Hindi and Bengali name by which it is commonly known, has the official statusin the Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia, 1998, as being a bitter tonic, febrifuge, and a hepatoprotective agent. 11 Numerous chemical constituents have been isolated in kalmegh, such as diterpene lactones and flavonoids.9,11Andrographolide, a diterpene lactone, which is present up to 1 percent in the plant, hasbeen shown to be the major active hepatoprotective constituent ofAndrographis . 9,11,12However, the extract graphis paniculata is more active than andrographolide suggesting that there are other minor constituents that contribute to the hepatop - rotective activity.13 The aqueous or alcohol extract of Andrographis paniculata has been shown to have hepatoprotective effects in a number of experi - mental liver damage\u2014alcohol, carbon tetrachloride, andbenzene hexachloride. 14-17The aqueous extract prevented necrosis when given to rats for 3 days before the administration of carbon tet - rachloride, whereas control rats showed massive necrosis of liver pa - renchyma cells. Increase in alanine aminotransferase ALT, aspartateHepatoprotective Agents serum bilirubin, and fatty acids was prevented.15 In another experiment, such pretreatment resulted in an increase of biliary flow and liver weight, while hexabarbitone sleeping time wasreduced, suggesting the induction of microsomal enzymes. 18The ex - tract also decreased carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatic micro - somal lactone, which is the major constitu - ent in the plant has shown hepatoprotective activity against carbontetrachloride, galactosamine, and paracetamol- and ethanol-inducedhepatotoxicity, apart from showing choleretic activity. 12,20-24 In an open trial, patients of acute viral hepatitis were given 60 ml of a decoction of Andrographis paniculata extract equivalent to 40 g of crude drug in three divided doses, for an average period of 24 days.Patients were assessed both for clinical and biochemical parameters.There was considerable symptomatic relief and statistically signifi-cant decrease in serum bilirubin, ALT, AST, and serum alkalinephosphatase, and an increase in protein synthesis as shown by an in-crease in serum globulin. 25 The drug has been used for centuries in India as a household rem- edy, as it is generally considered safe for use. No adverse effects arereported when administered standard doses; however, large oraldoses have been reported to cause gastric discomfort, vomiting, andloss of appetite. 11It is an official status as a drug in the Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia, 1998.11When given orally, in animals, the minimum lethal dose for andrographolide, neoandrographolide, and deoxydidehy - droandrographolide is greater than 20 g\u00b7kg/H110021.26A survey that reviewed the safety and efficacy of Andrographis paniculata in upper respira - tory disorders reported the drug to be safe and the adverse events be - ing mild and infrequent with few spontaneous reports of adverseevents. 27 Thus, although there is some evidence for its hepatoprotective activity from experimental studies and a preliminary clinical trial,further clinical work is needed for this much-used medicinal plant todelineate the range Eclipta alba is a small creeping prostate or sometimes erect plant with white flower heads, it is found throughout India in the moist and wet areas up to an elevation of 2,000 m.28In Ayurveda, it is consid- ered one of the best plants for the treatment of jaundice. Traditionallythe whole plant or its leaves are used. It is also used as a single drugpreferably in the fresh state. 29It is one of the most widely used plants in Ayurvedic formulations for the liver with 16 out of 40 preparationsin the market containing this plant as one of the ingredients. 30It has an official status as a hepatoprotective agent in the Indian Herbal Phar- macopoeia, volume 1 published in 1998.28 Chemically the major constituents are the coumestans\u2014wedelolactone (1.6 percent) and norwedelolactone or demethylwedelolactone, whichwere recognized as the main active constituents in 1986, 30 years after their first isolation. 28,31Other constituents include polyacetylenes, thio- phene derivatives, flavonoids, steroids, and triterpenoids.28 Several preparations of the plant, such as powdered aerial parts, fresh leaf juice, aqueous extracts, and alcoholic extracts have beentested for hepatoprotective activity in small animals using a variety ofexperimental models\u2014carbon tetrachloride, alcohol, acetaminophen,and D-galactosamine. 32-35The wed - elolactone and demethylwedelolactone exhibited antihepatotoxicactivity in in tetrachloride, - and primary cultured In vivo also ethyl acetate fraction protected mice fromphalloidin toxicity, no mortality being seen in the group being pre - treated with the drug, although the control group showed 70 percentmortality. In addition, ethyl acetate fraction, wedelolactone, anddemethylwedeloactone showed significant stimulatory effect on livercell regeneration. 31Wedelolactone has also been shown to be one ofHepatoprotective Agents 65the most potent 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors isolated from plants.36In vivo Eclipta alba has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory activ - ity against carrageenin-induced rat paw edema. It also inhibits the enzyme phospholipase A2 thereby preventing release of by arachidonic acid.32This combination of anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective activity makes Eclipta alba useful for the treatment of inflammatory liver diseases. Eclipta alba extract has also been shown to have significant anti - oxidant activity. It is a potent inhibitor of lipid peroxidation and scav - enges hydroxy radicals in vitro.37Extracts of Eclipta alba have shown in vitro inactivation of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) when in-cubated with HBsAg positive sera isolated from patients. 38However, no further work on this property of Eclipta alba has been published. Clinically, Eclipta alba plant powder at a dose level of 50 mg\u00b7kg/H110021 body weight in three divided doses was tried in two open preliminarytrials: in 50 children with jaundice and in 20 adults with infectivehepatitis. 39,40The treatment period varied from 3 to 7 weeks. Clinical response and liver function tests, such as serum bilirubin, alkalinephosphatase, and ALT, were monitored. Testing was continued tillpatients showed complete biochemical recovery and were followedup for 2-3 months thereafter. Clinical recovery was observed to be faster than biochemical nor- malization. Children showed a faster response to the drug when com-pared to adults; biochemical recovery being seen in 2-3 weeks oftherapy. Acute viral hepatitis is for most part a self-limiting disease;however, in countries such as India it can be associated with highmorbidity and mortality. Thus, any treatment that can hasten recoverydeserves further study. The aerial parts of Eclipta alba are commonly cooked and eaten as a vegetable in South India in order to protect the liver. The alcoholicextract of fresh Eclipta alba 's aerial parts did not show any sign of toxicity. When given orally and intraperitoneally in mice, the mini - mum lethal dose was greater than 2 g\u00b7kg /H110021.34In the clinical trials no side effects were seen or reported.39,40In a chronic study in mice there was no weight loss, no behavioral changes, and no mortality. In addi - tion, the histopathology of kidney, spleen, and liver of mice showedno significant difference from controls. In tissue culture studies in66 AYURVEDIC HERBSvero cells, no cytotoxicity and grayish brown cylindrical irregularly curved roots 5-10 cm long, found in the North - western Himalayas at an elevation of 2,700-4,500 m. The drug con - sists of dried rhizome and roots and is widely used in Ayurveda for the treatment of epidemic jaundice.42It is commonly mixed in com- pound preparations for the liver. The rhizomes have official status as a bitter tonic and for their hepatoprotective action in the Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia, volume I, published in 1998.43 Major chemical constituents of Picrorhiza kurroa are iridoid glycosides, and 43 The alcoholic extracts of roots of Picrorhiza kurroa were found to be hepatoprotective in number of experimental models. Picrorhiza kurroa prevented damage caused to the liver by intraperitoneal ad - ministration of carbon tetrachloride, reversing the increase in transaminase levels in rabbits.44It also showed protection against car- bon tetrachloride, paracetamol, and aflatoxin damage in rats, at adose level of 20 mg\u00b7kg /H110021once a day for 7 days, preventing significant rise of transaminase levels in all three models and restoring Na/H11001 K/H11001ATPase levels to normal in hepatic injury caused and aflatoxin.45In rats, pretreatment with Picrorhiza kurroa serum and glutathione-S- transferase activity by D-galactosamine and carbon tetrachloride,which is attributed to the overall antioxidant effect of the extract. 46-48 Among the six plant extracts tested, Picrorhiza kurroa was one of the two extracts with the most potent antioxidant activity.49AlcoholicHepatoprotective Agents 67extract of Picrorhiza kurroa has been fect in dogs.50 Kutkin, the from the alcoholic extract of Picrorhiza kurroa, has been shown to be the hepatoprotective agent, whereas kutkin-free extracts are not active.51Subsequently picroliv, which is a standardized fraction consisting of 55-60 percent of a mix - ture of two iridoid glycosides picroside 1 and kutkoside I in the ratio 1:1.5, has been studied extensively in a variety of in vivo and ex vivoexperimental models: and protein synthesis in the liver.59In partially hepatectomized rats, rate of recovery in several biochemical markers in regenerating liver was faster.60This was also observed in rats pretreated with picroliv before hepatectomyas compared with control rats. 61 Picroliv showed a dose-dependent choleretic effect in conscious rats and anaesthetized guinea pigs.62It tetrachloride-,and thioacetamide-induced cholestatis. 62-64 In an open clinical study, 20 patients with acute hepatocellular jaundice were given 1 g of Picrorhiza kurroa root powder thrice daily for a mean period of 26 days. There was significant improvement inserum bilirubin and transaminase levels. It was also tried out in asmall group of six chronic patients for an average of 27 days: one pa-tient was considered cured and improvement was seen in the otherfive patients. 65In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, patients with acute viral hepatitis of less than 10 days durationwere given 375 mg Picrorhiza kurroa powder three times daily for 2 weeks. These patients showed marked clinical improvement inanorexia, malaise, nausea, vomiting, liver size, and tenderness. Therewas also significant reduction in serum bilirubin and transaminaselevels. Bilirubin levels took an average of 75.9 days to fall to 2.5 mg /H11080dl /H110021 with placebo, while Picrorhiza kurroa-treated patients took only 27.4 days to reach the same level. Thus, the drug is found to be useful intherapy of early viral hepatitis. 66 Picrorhiza kurroa is widely used in India for several indications. In clinical trials on patients with viral hepatitis, no side effects have68 AYURVEDIC HERBSbeen noticed using a dosage of 375 mg thrice daily for 14 days.66It is considered to have a laxative effect at larger dose levels.42It has been reported to have a mild laxative effect at 1 g and drastic purgation at 6 g. Clinical trials have been reported with dose levels of 1g threetimes a day with no untoward effects. 67See also Chapter 3 \"Gastroin - testinal agents.\" In a long-term clinical trial using up to 1 g of rootpowder for a period of 1 year in patients of bronchial asthma, no sideeffects were observed, although one patient complained of mild gas - tric irritation during the last 2 months of the trial. In rats and mice, thealcoholic extract did not affect the weight of spleen, thymus, and ad - renals and caused no gastric mucosal damage. 42 Tinospora cordifolia (see Plate 4 in color gallery) is a woody climber found on trees and shrubs throughout the tropical and sub-tropical parts of India. It grows readily in different soils, the stem at-taining a thickness of 6 cm diameter. Usually, however, the diameteris approximately 1 cm. 68As a drug, the plant growing on neem (Aza- dirachta indica) trees is considered to be valuable and therefore prized. Tinospora cordifolia 's mature stem powder, the aqueous extract, the starch obtained from the stem by repeated washing of crushed stem withwater are used in Ayurveda for debility, hepatitis, dyspepsia, jaundice,and other liver disorders. 69It is an official drug in the Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia, 1990, for its analgesic and antipyretic activity.70 Several classes of compounds have been isolated among them clerodane furanoditerpenes, alkaloids such as a fewother 70Anticomplement and 69In acute liver damage caused by carbon tetrachloride, pretreatment for 4 weeks with Tinospora cordifolia aqueous extract, prepared by decocting the stems at a dose of 100 mg\u00b7kg/H110021body weight, was found to aggravate acute damage. However, it was effective in preventing fibrotic changes in the liver, and it enhanced parenchymal tissue re - generation in albino rats.72In a chronic liver disease model using Kupffer cells, Tinospora cordifolia was found to cause significant improvement in Kupffer cell functioning thereby preventing fibroustissue deposition and tending toward normalization. 73This suggests that the antifibrotic effect is mediated by activation of Kupffer cells.73 An aqueous suspension of alcoholic extract of the stem of Tinospora cordifolia was shown to protect against liver damage caused by ad- ministration of carbon tetrachloride in mice, rats, and rabbits.74The aqueous extract of Tinospora cordifolia also showed significant anti- inflammatory activity in acute and chronic inflammation in rats.75 Immune suppression is caused by the development of cholestasis in rats and suggests the need for an immunomodulator such as Tinospora cordifolia in the treatment of obstructive jaundice. Thus, treatment with the aqueous extract (100 mg\u00b7kg/H110021)o fTinospora cordifolia given orally twice daily for 7 days, 4 weeks after the development ofcholestasis, resulted in the improvement of cellular immune functionas evidenced by normalization of phagocytic activity of macrophagesand polymorphonuclear cells, and the intracellular killing capacity ofmacrophages. Cholestatic rats were also more susceptible to infection;however, when receiving Tinospora cordifolia they better resisted in - fection caused by Escherichia coli with 16.67 percent mortality in the treated group as compared to 77.78 percent in the untreated group. 76 This finding was used in a clinical study where 30 patients under - going surgery for malignant obstructive jaundice were administered Tinospora cordifolia in addition to the conventional treatment of Vitamin K, antibiotics, and biliary drainage.77Thus, only those patients who additionally received 16 mg /H11080kg/H11080day/H110021ofTinospora cordifolia aqueous extract for 3 weeks, after institution of biliary drainage, showed normalization of phagocytic and killing capacity of neutro - phils, although in both groups hepatic function was comparable.None of the patients receiving Tinospora cordifolia treatment showed septicemia as compared to 50 percent of the patients who were on70 AYURVEDIC HERBSconventional treatment alone, although 92.4 percent of the Tinospora cordifolia -treated group survived, in contrast to 40 percent postoper - ative survival in the conventional treatment group. Tinospora cordifolia is considered safe at the usual dose levels of 3-6 g.78In acute toxicity studies, the stem extract had almost no tox - icity; rabbits and albino rats could be administered up to 1.6 g /H11080kg/H110021 without untoward effects.79In another study on mice and rats, the aqueous extract of stem in a dose range of 50 mg to 1 g /H11080kg/H110021was found safe in acute (72 hours) and subacute (4 weeks) studies with no damage to liver and kidney.80The extract was also evaluated on organ function in healthy volunteers for 15 days.80 NOTES 1.

VIRAL HEPATITIS Viral hepatitis is a major cause of mortality and morbidity espe - cially in the developing world. Several types of virus have been iden - tified\u2014A, B, C, D, E, and G. Hepatitis A and E, which spread through infected food and water, are usually self-remitting. However,hepatitis B and C, which are transmitted parenterally through in - fected blood products, through sexual contact, or vertical transmis-sion from mother to child, can become chronic. Hepatitis B is the most common viral disease in the world with over 300 million chronic carriers. Although a major proportion of pa-tients who contract hepatitis B clear the virus from the blood, a defi-nite proportion of patients go on to become chronic carriers. Thesecarriers serve as a reservoir for further transmission of the diseaseand they are themselves at a risk of developing liver cirrhosis and/orhepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, there has been a great deal of interest in testing Indian me- dicinal plants for their activity against hepatitis B. Of these, the beststudied is the plant known as Phyllanthus amarus orPhyllanthus fraternus and is often reported in literature un - der this name. However, the plant has now been confirmed to be Phyllanthus amarus, with Phyllanthus niruri being an American spe 5 in color gallery) is a small herb found throughout the hotter parts of India, especially after the rains. Traditionally, all parts of the plant are used medicinally\u2014leaves, ten - der aerial parts, and roots. The plant known as bhumyamalaki or tamalaki in Sanskrit has been known for centuries in the treatment of jaundice. Interestingly the use of the plant tamalaki is first mentionedin multiplant preparations for jaundice in Caraka Samhita. 2It is a commonly used, popular household remedy for the treatment of jaun - dice. In South India, a bolus of the whole plant is administered withbuttermilk. It is traditionally used for jaundice, dyspepsia, colic, andas an appetite stimulant and a diuretic. 3It has been studied exten- sively, following the discovery that it can bind the hepatitis B virussurface antigen (HBsAg). 4The aerial parts of Phyllanthus amarus have official status in the Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia, volume II, 1999, for antiviral activity.5 to be hepatoprotective against carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatotoxicity in primary cultured hepatocytes. 6 T h ep l a n th a sb e e ns h o w nt oh a v ea ni nv i t r oa n t i v i r a la c t i v i t y against hepatitis B.4,7The plant extracts have been shown to inhibit HBs-Anti HBs reaction and inhibit HBV DNA polymerase activity. Incell it downregulates HBV mRNA transcription and replicationand inhibits enhancer I activity. 8,9In woodchucks it has been shown to clear those infected with Woodchuck Hepatitis Virus (WHV) and pro - long the mean survival time.10The hepatoprotective activity of Phylla- nthus amarus on carbon tetrachloride damage has also been shown.11,12 In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 59 percent of chronic hepatitis B patients became HBsAg negative after ingesting 200 mgpowder of aerial parts of Phyllanthus amarus three times a day for 1 month, while seroconversion in the placebo group was 4 percent. 13 In another open trial with 28 chronic HBV carriers, clearance rate of20 percent was seen in patients who were HBeAg negative, that isthose who did not show active replication of the virus. 14However, in Thailand, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial using Thai Phyll anthus HBsAg from asymptomatic carriers.15Hepatoprotective Agents 77Similarly, seroconversion was not seen in a trial conducted in New Zealand using material from Madras (now Chennai), standardizedusing geraniin\u2014a hydrolysable tannin\u2014 as a marker for standardiza - tion. 16 Despite the fact that there have been negative clinical trials, Phyllanthus amarus must be considered a plant of potential use for viral hepatitis B. However, further work is required on choice of plantmaterial, method of processing, dosage to be used, and period oftreatment, especially because of the presence of ecotypes ofPhyllanthus amarus. In acute viral hepatitis, A, B, non-A, and non-B, 4 week-treatment with Phyllanthus amarus was compared with Essentiale (as essential phospholipid from soybean oil) and another control group of patientswho were treated with vitamins. In acute viral hepatitis B, patients onPhyllanthus amarus had significantly faster recovery. Phyllanthus amarus also seemed to accelerate the clearance of HBsAg in 86.9 percent of patients of convalescing from acute viral hepatitis B casesin 3 months time, as against 48 percent in the Essentiale-treatedgroup, and 50 percent in controls on vitamins. 17 In an early open trial, in 160 children in the age group of 1-12 years, Phyllanthus fraternus (Phyllanthus amarus) was found useful in infective hepatitis at a dose level of 50 mg /H11080kg/H110021in three divided daily doses for 6 weeks. A total of 101 children who completed thetrial were considered cured, although there were 59 dropouts. Clini-cal response was marked after 2 weeks and no side effects wereseen. 18 Phyllanthus amarus has been commonly and widely used in India for a very long time. In dosages commonly used (3-6 g of plant pow - der twice daily) no adverse reactions have been reported.19A 90-day study with mice did not show any mortality or weight loss.20 NOTES 1.

OTHER ANTIVIRAL PLANTS Although a few other Indian plants were found active when tested for activity against hepatitis B, including picroliv from Picrorhiza kurroa that was found to bind HBsAg,1only Picrorhiza kurroa was tested clinically in a double-blind clinical trial on chronic carriers of hepatitis B and found to be inactive.2However, this should be consid- ered only a preliminary result and further work is needed on this. Inthe trial, patients were divided into four groups and randomly allocatedto receive 500 mg of Phyllanthus amarus, Picrorhiza 1 mixture andPicrorhiza kurroa, or a placebo given thrice daily for 3 months. There was a 25-percent clearance inthePhyllanthus amarus -treated group, 11.1-percent clearance in the combination group, whereas there was no conversion in the Picrorhiza kurroa and placebo groups. Other single plants that have undergone clinical evaluation are Berberis acute viral hepatitis,Berberis aristata treatment led to rapid clinical and biochemical im - provement. 3In a comparative study of 42 uncomplicated cases of acute viral hepatitis, the effect of Ayurvedic drugs such as Picrorhiza kurroa root powder and Berberis aristata bark powder at a dose level of 2 g in four divided doses was studied against a placebo. Early clini - cal and biochemical improvement was seen in drug-treated cases ascompared with the placebo group. A better response was seen inPicrorhiza kurroa-treated patients as compared to those treated withBerberis aristata, whereas clinical improvement was poor in patients on placebo. 4 In six patients of viral hepatitis, single administration of drops of aqueous extract of Luffa echinata dried fruits into the nostrils lead to intense rhinorrhea and to a significant reduction of serum bilirubin80 AYURVEDIC HERBSand ALT levels within 2-7 days, and was accompanied by substantial relief in clinical symptoms. The nasal secretions contained total bili - rubin ranging from 1.6 to 5.5 mg percent; however, the authors5feel that the possibility that there is nasal absorption of the drug and con - sequent action on the liver cannot be ruled out.

Therapeutic potential of Luffa echinata Indian ASCITES Boerhaavia diffusa L. (family Nyctaginaceae) has tried out clin - ically in cases of ascites due to early liver and peritoneal conditions and has been found to be very beneficial with the drug producing markeddiuresis leading in some cases to disappearance of ascites. 1Experimen - tally the plant has been shown to have hepatoprotective, diuretic, and anti-inflammatory activity.2-5A study of the diuretic and anti-inflamma - tory activity of different parts of the plant showed that the water-solubleportion of the alcoholic extract of the root and leaf were more active thanthe whole-plant extract. 5It has also been shown that the aqueous extract of the root was more active than the root powder, and it was most activewhen collected in the month of May. 6The plant has official status as a hepatoprotective and diuretic in the Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia,Hepatoprotective Agents 81volume I, 19987It is a commonly used plant for jaundice, and further studies need to be carried out.

CHRONIC CHOLECYSTITIS Single plants do not appear to have been tried out in chronic cholecystitis. However, the alkaloid berberine from Berberis vulgaris, either as a sulfate or hydrochloride, was shown to be effec- tive in alleviating the clinical symptoms in chronic cholecystitis patients by reducing the bilirubin levels and increasing the gallbladder bile volume. 1Isolated compounds cannot be considered to be plant drugs, but may point the way to activity in the crude drug orits extract. Thus, despite the long history of clinical use of plants in Ayurveda for the treatment of liver diseases, few controlled clinical trials havebeen carried out. Many of the plants have been studied experimen - tally for hepatoprotective activity, some for choleretic andanticholestatic activity, and a few of them for liver cell regeneration82 AYURVEDIC HERBSand antiviral activity against the hepatitis B virus. Chemical work to identify active constituents has also been carried out. The result of thescientific studies so far has been the setting off of a differentiation inthe pharmacological profile and therefore a change in the way weview these plants. For these plants to acquire a wider usage, furtherwork is required in the universally acceptable standards of theirquality, efficacy, and safety. NOTE 1. Handa SS, Sharma A, Chakraborti KK.

Fitoterapia LVII: 307-351 (1986).Hepatoprotective Agents 83Chapter 5 Respiratory Tract Drugs In modern medicine, respiratory tract drugs include antiallergic drugs, antiasthmatic drugs, and antitussives.1In Ayurveda, respiratory problems are considered to arise from poor digestion2and therefore the herbs prescribed in Ayurveda for treatment of respiratory disorders not only improve digestion but also have other useful effects likeantiallergic activity and immunostimulant activity. For example, Piper longum is a carminative agent that improves digestion, and has antianaphylactic and immunostimulant effects. A large number ofherbs have been used to stimulate digestion, reduce the cough reflex,liquefy phlegm, and aid in the removal of phlegm through expectora-tion. Some of the conditions associated with respiratory tract prob-lems have been classified as kasa (cough), swasa (dyspnea), and kasa swasa (bronchial asthma) . The most popular home remedies for these conditions include spices, such as ginger, turmeric, black, andlong pepper, and common plants, such as Adhatoda Solanum xanthocarpum, Solanum trilobatum, etc. NOTES 1.

The Ayurvedic concept and the pathogenesis of the disease are considered to be similar to that in Allopathy and these have beendiscussed. 1The Ayurvedic term tamaka swasa or less correctly kasa swasa, consists of the names of its two major symptoms\u2014cough (kasa) and breathlessness (swasa) . A number of plants recommended by Caraka are still in use today. There are 33 major herbs that have been listed1and 22 plants that have been tried out Adhatoda vasica is an evergreen perennial shrub found all over India up to an elevation of 600 m.3The name of the plant is derived from the Tamil (adu: goat, thodathu: will not touch) because the fetid smell of the leaves keeps goats away. Therefore, it is often used for fencing in villages, as it is safe from grazing animals, and also be - cause it is then readily available for use. Medicinally the use of theplant\u2014leaves, roots, and flowers\u2014 has been known for over 2,000years. The Caraka Samhita recommends its use for cough. The leaf ofAdhatoda vasica is traditionally used in Ayurveda for the treat - ment of cold, cough, bronchitis, and asthma. It is considered an ex - pectorant, and aids in the liquefying and removal of phlegm. 3,4Not86 AYURVEDIC HERBSonly is it used as a hemostatic agent in bleeding disorders, it also helps in the healing of wounds, in peptic ulcer (see Chapter 3), and inpyorrhea and bleeding gums (see Chapter 14). 5The leaf of Adhatoda vasica has the official status in the Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia, 2002, as a bronchodilator and an expectorant.6 Among the constituents of Adhatoda vasica are an essential oil containing limonene, flavonoids, resin, and several alkaloids of which the major alkaloid is vasicine (~1 percent),3which has been shown to possess brochodilatory activity.7Vasicinone, a minor alka - loid, has been shown in vitro to be a potent vasodilator.8In vivo vasicinone was found to be as potent a bronchodilator as theophyllineand 5,000 times less potent than isoprenaline. 9 Adhatoda vascia showed antiallergic and antiasthmatic properties in guinea pigs. A fraction containing the minor alkaloid vasicinol and20 percent vasicine inhibited ovalbumin- and PAF-induced allergicreactions at a dose level of 5 mg per animal by inhalation and 2.5 g /H11080kg /H110021 by intragastric administration.10Adhatoda vasica extract of flowers and leaves has been shown in guinea pigs to have an antitussive activ-ity similar to codeine against coughing induced by irritant aerosols. 11 A double-blind clinical trial was conducted on \"Wintry,\" a product con- taining 25 mg of a mixture of vasicine and vasicinone per tablet, againstplacebo. One tablet was given thrice a day against the placebo for 4 weeks.An equal number of 30 patients of asthmatic bronchitis received the drugand the placebo, respectively. All patients were given 250 mg amoxicillinfor the first week. Out of the 30 patients who received Wintry 21 showedimprovement both clinically and on spirometer tests for lung function, 6 ofthe patients remained unchanged, the condition of 3 patients deteriorated.Of those on placebo, only 4 patients improved, whereas 10 remained un - changed and the condition of 16 patients deteriorated. 12 The leaves of Adhatoda vasica are also commonly used to treat cold and are considered to be effective when administered at the firstsigns of the infection. Despite the long history of its use, there are noclinical trials to evaluate the full scope of the use of this plant, and thisis an urgent requirement. Despite a long safe history of the use of Adhatoda vasica in human beings, there has been concern on the possibility that vasicine exerts anabortifacient effect, 6based on evidence from parenteral administration.13Respiratory Tract Drugs 87An experimental study on rats,14on the possible abortive effect of oral administration of 325 mg/H11080 kg/H110021per day of the leaf extract, produced no abortion in treated animals. Further, after an extensive review of the liter - ature, it was concluded that there is no scientifically valid evidence for potentially harmful effects on human beings, including the effect duringpregnancy. 15Chronic toxicity studies in two species with vasicine hydro - chloride at dose levels ranging from 2.5 to 20 mg /H11080kg/H110021body weight did not show any toxic effects. There was no difference in the body weight and the mortality of test animals and controls. Histopathology showedno abnormality of major organs. 16Total extract of the plant, dissolved in water at 2-8 ml /H11080kg/H110021for 90 T ree Albizzia lebbeck is a large deciduous, spreading tree found all over India, up to an elevation of 1,200 m. The bark, seeds, leaves, and flow-ers are used for medicinal purposes; however, the bark is considered inthe classic literature as the best antidote to both plant and animal poi-sons. It is used both as a single drug and in combination with otherdrugs in the form of bark powder or decoction. 18In Kerala, the bark powder, made into a paste, is rubbed on the body to soothe itching.19 The stem bark contains 7-11 percent anthraquinone glycosides. 20-22Three sapo - nins albizziasaponin A, B, and C have also been isolated.22 The flowers contain, approximately, 4 percent of an essential oil andseveral saponins lebbekanin A-H. 20,22 The Albizzia lebbeck has been stud - ied experimentally for its general pharmacological properties, andespecially for its antiasthmatic and shown88 AYURVEDIC HERBSimmunomodulatory activity and mast-cell stabilization apart from its ability to prevent allergen-induced bronchospasm. In sensitized guinea pigs, the bark decoction acted as a shield against horse serum antigen,23whereas both the bark and the flower decoction protected against histamine-induced bronchospasm. Thebark decoction had significant cromoglycate-like activity, such as ac - tion on the mast cells, and appeared to inhibit the early process ofsensitization and synthesis of reaginic-type antibodies. 24,25It reduced the secretion of macrophage migration inhibition factors.25Albizzia lebbeck, when administered simultaneously with histamine, reduces the release of catecholamine at a dose of 100 mg/H11080 kg/H110021up to a maximum effective dose of 200 mg /H11080kg/H110021bodyweight of alcoholic extract.26,27 Fractions of stem bark of Albizzia lebbeck also reduced the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis and mast-cell degranulation in rats.28Hot wa- ter and butanol extracts of the bark administered, once daily for 1week, to mice that were previously immunized by sheep's red bloodcorpuscles, developed higher antibody titer that comparable tothe standard drug muramyl dipeptide (MDP). 29 Bronchial Asthma A few trials have been conducted with the bark of Albizzia lebbeck in bronchial asthma. A total of 60 patients were given 25 ml of theaqueous decoction, from 100 g of the bark, four times a day for3 weeks. Excellent results were obtained in cases of not more than2 years duration; however, in patients with a long history of the dis-ease, the outcome was variable. The decoction was found to relievedifficulty in breathing, reduce cough, and increase the breath holdingtime, improve the vital capacity and forced respiratory volume inbronchitis. The saponins were considered to be the main active prin - ciple behind all these actions. 30 In an open trial, 19 patients with bronchial asthma were given 30 ml decoction of shirish bark thrice daily for 6 weeks. There was significant fall in eosinophil count and the erythrocyte sedimentationrate ESR and increase in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). Nearly allpatients experienced symptomatic relief. There was also highly sig - nificant effect based on a total of 12 subjective and objective parame - ters of bronchial asthma such as breathlessness, cough, paroxysmalRespiratory Tract Drugs 89attacks of dyspnea, wheezing, rhonchi, pulmonary function tests, etc. assessed in all patients before start of the trial and subsequently fourtimes during and beyond treatment at 15-day intervals. 31 The flowers have been tried out for tropical pulmonary eosinophilia.32See later in this chapter. Considering the results ob - tained so far, further trials need to be carried out with standardizedmaterial, controls, and larger patient numbers. It has been reported that in the experience of Ayurvedic physicians no serious toxicity has been seen clinically. 24In the clinical trial, us - ing the flowers of shirish, no side effect or toxicity was seen.32LD50in albino rats was found to be 2 g/H11080kg/H110021body weight and LD00.4 g/H11080kg/H110021. Rats that were given 25 mg /H11080kg/H110021ofAlbizzia lebbeck daily for 2 weeks showed no difference, from controls, in body weight, general behav-ior, and food intake. In addition, the mortality rate was similar in bothgroups. 24 Boswellia Boswellia serrata (see Plate 2 in color gallery) has been used in a number of conditions. In respiratory tract conditions likecough, bronchitis, fever, and asthma it is used either by inhalation ofthe smoke or as a decoction. 33,34When taken internally, it acts as a stim- ulant expectorant in pulmonary diseases.35 Research has shown that the gum resin of Boswellia serrata is use- ful in a number of inflammatory conditions in which leukotrienesplay an important role in the causation and maintenance of diseases,such as inflammatory bowel diseases\u2014Crohn's disease and ulcer - ative colitis,\u2014rheumatism, asthma, and in the reduction of edema incertain kinds of brain tumor. 34See Chapters 3, 8, and 13. In asthma, leukotrienes are the important mediators of eosinophil levels. Therefore, leukotrienes have be - come important targets for potential antiasthmatic drugs. 36The boswellic acids present in Boswellia serrata have been shown to inhibit leukotriene synthesis, and therefore are capable of playing apotentially useful role in the management of asthma.90 AYURVEDIC HERBSIn a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, 80 patients of bronchial asthma were given either 300 mg of gum resin of Boswellia serrata or 300 mg lactose as a placebo thrice daily for 6 weeks. In the treated group, the mean duration of the disease was 9-15 years. Seventy percent of the treated group showed improvement in symp - toms, such as difficulty in breathing, rhonchii, number of attacks, andlung function tests such as forced vital capacity, etc., 36leading the au - thors to believe that further studies, with a standardized product, arerequired to confirm the initial results obtained. Boswellia serrata is usually well tolerated; however, it can give rise to gastrointestinal side effects in a small percentage of patients.In the bronchial asthma trial, with 300 mg thrice daily, 2 out of 40 pa-tients complained of stomach pain, nausea, and hyperacidity. 36See also Chapter 3, is a commonly used household remedy for cough and cold, taken mixed in hot milk. It is used, internally, in Ayurveda, totreat asthma, cold, cough, and fever, 37usually along with other herbs and rarely ever alone.38 Curcumin, the main active principle and coloring matter in tur - meric, has been shown to have a spasmolytic effect on various spasmogens.39Extracts of turmeric have been shown to have an antiallergic effect; the ethyl acetate extract being the most active in exerting anti-inflammatory and antiallergic effect.40,41In addition, the curcuminoids are considered to be very effective antiallergic compo - nents;40the activity of ethyl acetate extract and curcumin being owing to the inhibition of histamine release.42 Powdered rhizomes of Curcuma longa w e r eg i v e ni ni n c r e a s i n g doses from 4 to 32 g daily for 15-45 days to 71 bronchitis patients,Respiratory Tract Drugs 9113 bronchiestatis patients, 18 bronchial asthmatic patients, and 12 tropical eosinophilic patients. A significant relief in signs andsymptoms was noticed in 11 out of 71 cases of bronchitis, 1 out of13 cases of bronchiestatis, 5 out of 18 cases of bronchial asthma,and 6 out of 12 cases of tropical eosinophilia. 43 Turmeric powder either as such or after frying in ghee\u2014made from butter by heating until most of the water evaporates\u2014 was givenin a dose of 6-12 g for 15-20 days to patients of asthma with differing\"humoral vitiation\" according to Ayurvedic criteria based on symp - toms such as degree of dyspnea, phlegm, dryness of throat, rales, andronchii. Sixty percent of the treated patients showed improvementwith a decrease in the intensity of cough and dyspnea. In addition,there was a reduction in the amount of sputum. In this trial, the diag - nosis was an Ayurvedic diagnosis, and there was variation in the dos- age also. 38 It would be worthwhile to conduct a trial to check the dosage re- quirements and the kind of clinical response that can be achieved considering the continued scientific support that turmeric receivesfrom modern investigations. For details on the safety of turmeric, a commonly used spice in Indian cooking, see Chapter 3. In the trial on patients with bronchiala s t h m a ,w h ow e r eg i v e n1 2g /H11080day /H110021of turmeric powder, a few patients complained of dryness of mouth and throat, and a mild headache miti-gated by the reduction in the dosage or changing the so-called \"vehi-cle,\" 38which in Ayurveda, are hot water, milk or milk with clarified butter (ghee), used to aid in the absorption of the drug and in directingit to the English: Holy basil, Sacred basil Sacred to the Hindus, the holy basil is a small herb with an aromatic smell found throughout India and commonly cultivated in gardens and92 AYURVEDIC HERBScourtyards. There are two varieties of this herb: one with green stems called Sri Tulasi and the other with purple stems known as Krishna Tulasi, which is the preferred one in medicine. The leaves of the holy basil are a commonly used household remedy for cough, cold, bron - chitis, and asthma. The leaves have the official status in the Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia, 2002, for their expectorant properties.44 The leaves contain 0.4-0.8 percent of an essential oil containing eugenol and /H9252-caryophyllene as major constituents.44In addition, the acids, gallic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and rosmarinicacid. 47 Several phenolic compounds, isolated from fresh leaves and stems, exhibited antioxidant activity (e.g. apigenin, rosmarinic alcoholic extract of Ocimum sanctum leaves was found to be protective against histamine and Acacia arabica pollen-induced asthma in guinea pigs in a dose- dependent fashion.49In addition, it acted as an inhibitor against mine-induced spasm in guinea pig tracheal chain preparation.49A 50- percent alcoholic extract and volatile oil fresh leaves inhibitedhistamine and acetyl choline-induced preconvulsive dyspnea inguinea pigs, but the extract from dried leaves did not contain these properties. 50,51 All the trials with Ocimum sanctum are of preliminary nature and further trials are urgently needed with standardized preparations, larger patient numbers, and better methodology. Asthma In an open trial with 20 patients of asthma, 500 mg of Ocimum sanctum extract, made into tablets, was given thrice daily for 1 week. Relief was observed, within 3 days, in breathlessness and in vital capacity, but there was no change in the eosinophil count.52In another open trial, the leaves of Ocimum sanctum were tried in cases of bronchial asthma and stress-related hypertension, and were found toRespiratory Tract Drugs 93be highly effective in these cases. Unfortunately, more details are not available.53 Viral encephalitis In a preliminary clinical trial, 16 patients with acute viral encepha - litis were divided into two groups: one group of ten patients receivedsteroids, whereas the remaining six patients were given dried aque - ous extract from 2.5 g of fresh leaves four times daily. The crudeextract of Ocimum sanctum was found to be more effective than ste - roids in the treatment of patients with viral encephalitis. In the steroid group two patients dropped out, six died, and two patients had resid - ual paralysis, whereas in the Ocimum sanctum group one patient dropped out, one died, three recovered completely, and one had resid- ual paralysis. 54 The holy basil is generally considered a very safe drug, and many Indians often consume a few leaves as part of their daily ritual.55This habit is often cited as one reason for lower birth rates in men consum-ing holy basil leaves on a long-term basis, which may have some ex-perimental evidence in the reversible antiandrogenic property of theleaves. 56No side effects have been reported in the clinical trials.46,52 Constipation was the only side effect, in one trial where doses rang-ing from 5 to 27 g were taken by 120 patients for 3 months. 55 Piper Pepper Piper longum is a slender aromatic climber found throughout the hotter parts of India.57The roots, the stem, and more importantly the fruiting spikes are used for medicinal purposes.58Piper longum is a powerful stimulant and has been used for a long time for digestiveand respiratory disorders. The fruits and stem are therefore oftenmixed with the ingredients of a stimulant soup called \"Tippili rasam\"94 AYURVEDIC HERBSin South India as a household remedy for cough and bronchial disor - ders. Piper longum has been mentioned Caraka Samhita as a prophylactic agent in asthma.59It is used in Ayurveda to treat cough, cold, asthma, bronchitis, laryngitis, gas, abdominal distention, and also arthritis and sciatica.60,62Piper longum is considered a rejuve - native drug for the lungs, and is used as a milk decoction to treat asthma.60The fruits have the official status in the Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia, 2002, for their antiallergic, antiasthmatic, and hepa - toprotective properties.57 The fruits contain 1 percent of an essential oil and 4-5 percent of the pungent principle piperine. Other minor components include piplartine and piperlongumine, and The petroleum ether extract of the fruits acts as a respiratory stimu- lant at lower doses. However, with higher doses, it causes convul-sions in several species of small animals. 61,62Crude extracts as well as the alkaloid piplartine suppressed ciliary movements in the esopha-gus of frog; piplartine being more active than the aqueous or alco-holic extracts, suggesting that Piper longum may act by suppression of cough reflex. 63 Piper longum fruit-milk extract reduced effectively passive cuta- neous anaphylaxis in rats64and protected guinea pigs against antigen induced bronchospasm. However, there was no significant effect onthe total quantity of histamine in various organs\u2014lungs, trachea, andintestines or on the release of histamine on antigenic challenge. 65In an experiment using rat lung perfusion in sensitized animals, the milkextract increased the rate of flow. 66Piperine blocked the spasms in - duced by various spasmogens in isolated guinea pig and rabbit intes - tines, and decreased the rate of respiration.67 Bronchial asthma There is also a special course of treatment in Ayurveda known as Vardaman pippali (vardaman: increasing; pippali: long pepper), which is given as a prophylactic in asthma. During this treatment,long pepper is given in increasing doses to reach a maximum for thatRespiratory Tract Drugs 95age and then again reduced back to the original dosage. Three clinical studies have been conducted using this kind of regimen. In a double-blind clinical study, 240 children suffering from bronchial asthma in the age group of neonates to 12 years were given 2-3 coursesof the Piper longum, each course consisting of a gradually increasing dosage of Piper longum starting from a minimum of 1 g to reach a maxi - mum of 30 g, and then a reduction of the dosage to the original dose.There was significant reduction in the frequency and severity of asth - matic attacks, with 80 percent of patients showing improvement, 17 per - cent no improvement, and 8 percent becoming worse. 68 In another open study, 20 children (1-12 years) with asthma were administered Piper longum fruit powder in a gradually increasing dosage over a period of 5 weeks. Each child below 5 years receivedthe 150 mg fruit powder in capsules, whereas a child above 5 yearsreceived 250 mg of the fruit powder in capsules. The dosage was onecapsule per day in the first week, two in the second, three in the third,two in the fourth, and one in the fifth week. This regimen signifi-cantly reduced the severity and frequency of asthmatic attacks. Therewas no significant difference in the IgE values in six children. At theend of 1 year, 11 patients showed excellent response, 3 showed mod-erate response, whereas 3 out of 20 patients failed to show any satis-factory response. Three patients with a history of food allergy wereable to consume the offending items after the treatment. There wasexcellent response to the drug and only one patient complained ofnausea. 69 In a preliminary study, a preparation of Piper longum with milk, known as \"Pippali kshira paka\"\u2014 made by boiling to dryness 40 g of long pepper in 500 ml of milk and 2 l of water\u2014was given for4 weeks in three divided daily doses to ten patients with bronchialasthma. The response was evaluated as good to moderate in eightpatients. 70 In another study using \" vardhaman pippali, \" in 60 patients with different respiratory disorders, the drug was found to exhibit good ef - ficacy, and was found to be very effective in patients with bronchialasthma. 71 The use of Piper longum fruits has been known for a long time, and is well tolerated in the dosages commonly used (250-500 mg thrice a96 AYURVEDIC HERBSday).72In the clinical trial on 20 children between the age group of 1 and 12 years, the tolerance to the drug was rated as excellent with only one patient complaining of nausea after the intake of drug.69 Nausea was also noted in the trial on patients with bronchial asthma.70 Toxicity studies in albino rats employing a milk extract of the fruitboiled in milk at 1 g/H11080kg /H110021did not cause any mortality.72Acute, sub - acute, and chronic toxicity studies showed no adverse effect.72-74In the treated animals there was a significant increase in the weight oflung and spleen, as compared to control animals. 74No is a very spiny diffuse herb found throughout India. The drug consists of the dried whole plant, includ-ing leaves, stem, flowers, fruits, and root, and it has been used medic - inally for a number of conditions since the time of Caraka and Sushruta. 75However, it is best known for its use in respiratory disor- ders, helping to expectorate stubborn phlegm in productive cough, bronchitis, and asthma.76The plant is an official drug in the Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia as an expectorant.77 The plant contains norcarpesterol, cholesterol, and derivatives.77 Only a few studies have been carried out and these support the use of the drug in asthma. The glucoalkaloid and fatty acid fractions ofSolanum xanthocarpum extracts cause liberation of histamine from the lung tissue, suggesting that the beneficial effect of the drug inRespiratory Tract Drugs 97bronchial asthma may be due to the removal of histamine from bron - chial and lung tissue.78,79The glucoalkaloid and the alcoholic fraction at 2 mg /H11080kg/H110021ip also protected against antigen-induced bronchospasm; in sensitized guinea pigs the protection being estimated as 66.6-70.2 percent.80In addition, it has been suggested that the saponins from Solanum xanthocarpum may be inducing the formation of anti - allergic substances.81 The efficacy of Solanum xanthocarpum has been tried out in bron - chial asthma.82-86Starting with a preliminary open study with 11 patients suffering from bronchial asthma and 4 patients suffering from non - specific cough,82the next exploratory study had 60 patients with chronic obstructive airway disease,83and then Solanum xantho- carpum was given to 305 patients with chronic respiratory diseases. There were 250 cases of bronchial asthma, 43 of chronic bronchitis, and 12 cases were suffering from nonspecific unproductive cough. Patients were given whole plant powder in a dose of 1 g, two or threetimes a day for one month. Fifty percent of the patients showed com-plete relief of symptoms with no side effects. Complete relief was ob-served in 55-74 percent of patients with bronchial asthma\u2014all casesof chronic bronchitis\u2014and in seven cases of nonspecific unproduc-tive cough. It was observed that the drug acted like an expectorant inthe presence of phlegm, and it acted as an antitussive agent in the caseof dry cough. 84 In the trial of 93 patients with cough (kasa) ,Solanum xantho- carpum was found effective in diminishing the intensity of cough and dyspnea in 50 percent of the cases using a total dose level of 60-200gof whole plant or root decoction, given in divided doses over a day for15-20 days. 84The dosages mentioned seemed highly excessive at first, but if taken together with the Hindi summary in the paper wheredecoction is mentioned and the next paper of the same author wherepatients were given 60-200 ml of decoction, the 60-200 g probablyrefers to 60-200 g of decoction and is indicated as such above. Afew patients complained of mouth and throat dryness, and a feelingof warmth, which was reduced by lowering the dose. 85According to Selected Medicinal Plants of India, dosage of Solanum xantho - carpum is 1-2 g of drug powder daily or 20-60 ml decoction twice daily.7598 AYURVEDIC HERBSIn an open exploratory trial, 44 patients with respiratory problems complaining of cough and dyspnea were given 60-120 ml of the whole plant or root decoction in a divided dosage with added honeyfor an average of 15-20 days. Diet was controlled and heavy food andsalty and sour articles such as pickles were avoided. There was awashout period of 7 days when patients were given glucose capsules. If there was no improvement with the intake of glucose capsules, treatment with the drug decoction was started. Patients were dividedinto two groups of 21 and 23 based on symptoms as per Ayurvediccriteria. The drug was found to be more useful in the group of patientswho had excessive phlegm, with 50 percent of them showing a reduc-tion in the amount of phlegm. The doctors also felt that the root wasmore effective than the whole plant. The trial serves to give an indica-tion of the utility of the drug and highlights the difficulty in correlat-ing Ayurvedic concepts with modern terms. Side effects were similarto the earlier trial. 86There is a need to hold further trials with larger numbers of patients, well-defined parameters, and with a standard-ized drug. In an open trial, 16 patients with chronic bronchial asthma were treated with 300 mg tablets of Solanum xanthocarpum extract, 2-4 tablets being given thrice daily for 3 months. The improvement wasgraded as excellent in six, good in three, fair in two, and no improve-ment in five patients. The drug was evaluated as affording relief to 56percent of the patients. No side effects were observed in patients evenin those with diabetes, hypertension, and coronary heart disease. 87 In another open trial, the effectiveness of a single dose of 300 mg of powdered whole plant of Solanum xanthocarpum orSolanum trilobatum \u2014another plant drug commonly used especially in South India\u2014was evaluated against the effectiveness of salbutamol 4 mg orderiphylline 200 mg (combination of theophylline and etiophylline).Pulmonary functions were assessed just before administration and again 2 hours after administration. Treatment with Solanum xanthocarpum orSolanum. trilobatum improved several parameters of pulmonary function significantly, although to a lesser extent when compared to deriphylline or salbutamol. The authors suggestthat increased dosages may lead to effects comparable to standarddrugs. No side effects were noted, both drugs being well tolerated. 88Respiratory Tract Drugs 99The studies emphasize the need to conduct further studies with a standardized drug to establish the dosage, the mechanism of action, and the usefulness of the drug in asthma. In clinical trials using Solanum xanthocarpum, side effects have generally been observed only in a few patients and have been mild,involving dryness of the mouth and throat, and a feeling of warmththroughout the body, which disappeared on dose reduction. 85,86In other studies, the drug was well tolerated and no adverse effects wereobserved. 87,88In albino rats, the hot water extract of seeds showed tox - icity at 200 mg /H11080kg/H110021.77,89In animal studies, the alkaloid solasodine has shown an antispermatogenic activity;90the relevance of these studies for human beings is yet to be established. Terminalia belerica Roxb. (Family: Combretaceae) The very descriptive: usually evoca- tive of either the appearance of the plant or its uses. Here the name bibhitaka orvibhitaka indicates that the regular use of this plant keeps one free from diseases. Fruits and oil from the plant have anumber of uses: the pulp is analgesic; the unripe fruit is a laxative; and the fruit is a part of the three-fruit combination of triphala, which is a bowel tonic and a laxative. The ripe fruit is useful in diarrhea (see Chapter 3). It is also useful in asthma and cough, helping in reducingthe bronchial inflammation. The pulp in honey is also used in eyediseases. 91The fruit pericarp is the official drug in the Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia, 2002, as an expectorant, a hypolipidemic, and a laxative.92 In an open exploratory clinical trial to evaluate the antitussive and antiasthmatic effect of Terminalia belerica, 93 patients, ages 1-79 years, were included in the trial after excluding 44 patients with tuberculosis. Among the patients included, 61 were suffering from cough (kasa) , 12 from dyspnea (swasa) , and 20 had both cough and dyspnea. The whole fruit, both rind and nut was powdered and ad - ministered in doses of 2-6 g thrice a day with water. No period of treatment is mentioned. The symptoms that were assessed were the following: cough (91), dyspnea (51), expectoration (58), pain inchest (29), wheezing (12), temperature (18), loss of weight (25), and100 AYURVEDIC HERBSloss of appetite (27). The evaluation revealed that 22 patients showed complete relief in symptoms, 27 had marked relief, 35 moderaterelief, and 9 had no relief in symptoms. The clinical impression wasthat the drug has bronchodilatory, antitussive, and antiasthmatic effects. 93 Terminalia belerica is generally considered safe in the doses used clinically. In the clinical trial reported above, the fruit powder was given in a dose of 2-6 g thrice a day with water; no adverse effectswere noticed, except for abdominal disturbances, probably due to the laxative effect of the fruit. 93 Tylophora indica (Burm. f.) Tylophora indica is a perennial climber found throughout India, and more commonly in the eastern and southern parts of India, up to an elevation of 900 m. The leaves and roots, with emetic, expecto - rant, and antidysentric properties, are considered a substitute for ipecacuanha. The use of the plant was initially regional, confinedonly to areas where the plant grows. Later, interest in the plant grew through the work of Dr. Kotak and Dr. Shivpuri, who showed thatconsumption of just 3-6 leaves of Tylophora indica had prophylactic action lasting for several weeks, and the use of the plant became morewidespread. The leaves are used as a household remedy for asthma,bronchitis, and whooping cough. 94,95 The leaves contain several alkaloids (0.2-0.4 percent) of which tylophorine (0.1 percent) is the major alkaloid. In addition, there /H9251-amyrin, Drugs 101Extracts and alkaloids from the leaves of Tylophora indica have been shown to have antiasthmatic, bronchodilatory, anti-inflamma - tory, antiallergic, and immune suppressive properties. The alcoholic extract and total alkaloids of Tylophora indica leaves have shown an antispasmodic effect in isolated tissues96and bronchodilation al - though inhibiting bronchoconstriction in guinea pig ileum.97Aque - ous extract of Tylophora indica leaf powder98and tylophorine,99the major alkaloid, have shown an antiallergic effect and have modifiedthe Schutz-Dale reaction in animals. In addition, the aqueous extractcaused leucopenia indicating an immunosuppressive effect. 98The been confirmed by lung perfusion experi-ments. 100Tylophorine has also shown significant anti-inflammatory effect in several models of inflammation in rats.101In vitro, the total alkaloids (0.1 \u00b5g/H11080ml/H110021) prevented the mast-cell degranulation pro- at dosages similar cromoglycate.102 Tylophora indica appears to stimulate phagocytic function103,105al- though the humoral component of the immune system.103 Tylophora alkaloids also inhibit cellular immune responses104,105 when administered at any stage of the immune response.104 A preliminary clinical study on 56 patients with bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis showed that there was a marked relief in 40-50 per-cent of the patients for a few weeks after ingestion of only 3-6 leaves,the dose being 1 fresh green leaf chewed and swallowed per day for3 days. If the patient improved, no further leaves were given and thecondition of the patient was monitored for 12 more weeks. Otherwise,leaf administration was continued for 3 more days, and in recalcitrantcases patients received leaves for 12 days. An initial observation wasmade that the magnitude of relief in symptoms experienced by the pa - tients was dependent on the intensity of side effects like sore mouth,loss of taste, vomiting, etc. 106This apparent correspondence between intensity of the side effects and the magnitude of reduction in symp - toms was not borne out in subsequent trials. Following these initial trials, further open and double-blind cross- over trials were performed that too showed significant beneficialeffects of Tylophora indica in asthma. 107-109 In a double-blind study, 135 cases of bronchial asthma were in - cluded and categorized into three groups depending upon the kind of102 AYURVEDIC HERBSasthma as seasonal, irregular, and perennial. Patients were random - ized into each category and given either drug or placebo in two divided doses for 6 days. Of the 135 patients 71 were treated withdried-leaf powder of Tylophora indica and 64 with placebo. The drug consisted of shade-dried and powdered Tylophora indica leaf (200 mg), spinach leaf shade-dried and powdered (160 mg), and glucose(40 mg),whereas the placebo contained spinach leaf shade-dried andpowdered, and glucose (340 mg) and ipecacuanha (60 mg). Improve - ment was assessed based on the reduction in signs and symptoms, reduction in the need for bronchodilators and steroids, and improve - ment in forced expiratory volume (FEV 1) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). On evaluation it was found that the results were not sta - tistically different except in the perennial group where there was a significant response, as compared to the placebo group, at the end ofthe 2 weeks. 110However, the question arises whether the use of ipeca- cuanha in the placebo group led to similar results being obtained inthe drug and the placebo groups, since ipecacuanha is used as anexpectorant. The efficacy of Tylophora indica was evaluated in two cross-over double-blind studies, one against placebo and the other against stan-dard antiasthmatic drug containing ephedrine hydrochloride, theo-phylline, and phenobarbitone sodium. There was no significantdifference in symptoms with the leaf compared to the standard asth-matic drug. In comparison with the placebo, the leaf showed asustained rise in maximum breathing capacity, vital capacity, peakexpiratory flow, and flow rate. There was also a significant reduction in nocturnal dyspnea. 111 In a trial to evaluate the physiological basis of the therapeutic ef - fect of Tylophora indica in bronchial asthma patients, lung function tests, levels of 17-ketosteroids in urine, and absolute eosinophil levels were compared in 18 healthy and 11 bronchial asthma patientsbefore and after the administration of Tylophora. Lung function tests included tidal volume, vital capacity, timed vital capacity, compli - ance, maximum ventilatory volume, and peak expiratory flow rate.Lung function tests were carried out in normal and asthmatic patientsimmediately after the intake of 10 mg isoprenaline and on the seventhday after two 100 mg capsules of Tylophora dried-leaf powder hadRespiratory Tract Drugs 103been taken twice daily for 6 days. It was found that there was signifi - cant improvement in lung function tests in bronchial asthma patients. In addition,17-ketosteroid levels increased and total eosinophil levelsdecreased as a result of Tylophora indica (asthmatica) intake. 112 Allergic rhinitis In another double-blind cross-over study, 50 allergic rhinitis pa - tients were given either capsules of Tylophora indica (250 mg leaf powder) or a placebo (250 mg lactose). Patients received 1 capsuleper day for 7 days. This was followed by a washout period of 5 days,then a cross over to the other capsules. Although Tylophora produced a significant reduction in the sneezing and nasal obstruction whencompared to placebo, there was no significant difference betweenTylophora and placebo regarding subjective feeling of nasal stuffiness, nasal smear, and response of nasal mucosa to antigen. The authors sug-gest that a higher dosage of 1 capsule twice a day for a longer period of a fortnight, after which the dose could be reduced, may be more ef-fective. 113 In clinical trials, where a fresh leaf of Tylophora indica was chewed, approximately 53-75 percent of patients reported side ef-fects, such as nausea, lasting for a few hours. Sore mouth due to vesi-cant effect of the leaf and loss of taste for salt was for a longer dura-tion and lasted up to 3-4 days after the last intake of leaf. 106,107 However, the frequency of side effects came down to 16.3 percentwith the intake of the alcoholic extract of Tylophora indica. Risk- benefit analysis and the lasting relief obtained by very small doseswere considered to compensate for the side effects seen. 108 NOTES 1. Goyal HR.

Common cold is characterized by a stuffy, runny nose, sore throat, headache,and fever. A number of plants have been used in Ayurveda to treat theURTIs; however, these have been little documented. At BanarasHindu University in Varanasi and elsewhere, plants that stimulate theimmune system have been studied for their potential in warding offURTI. Plants that have been experimented with are Sida rhombifolia, Sida vernonicaefolia, (see Plate 3 in color gallery) is a small bitter herb found throughout India. All parts of the plant are used medicinally. The plant is best known as a bitter tonic and febrifugeuseful in dysentery, cholera, consumption, influenza, bronchitis,swelling, and skin problems. 1A tincture of the plant was useful in arresting the progression of the epidemic during outbreaks of influ - enza in India. It is considered efficacious in intermittent and remittentfevers. 2The use of kalmegh as a bitter tonic and a hepatoprotective agent has been extensively investigated, as it is one of the mostwidely used plant in combination formulas for jaundice. See Chap - ter 4. Clinical investigation using Andrographis paniculata in the preven - tion and treatment of cold, and the treatment of bronchitis, tonsillitis,and influenza, has been carried out in other parts of the world, notablyRespiratory Tract Drugs 111in Sweden, where it has been in used for treatment of cold for the past 2 0y e a r s ,a n da l s oi nG e r m a n y ,C h i l e ,R u s s i a ,a n dT h a i l a n d . Andrographis paniculata extract from Andrographis paniculata have been nu - merous pharmacological investigations. The ethanolic extract3and andrographolide4have been shown to have antipyretic activity. In addi - tion, andrographolide has been shown to have immunomodulatory,5 anti-inflammatory,6and antiallergic7properties. The anti-inflammatory effect is possibly due of nitric oxide synthasein macrophages response.9 Common study, 1,200 mg of Andro- graphis paniculata' s dried extract containing 4 percent of andro- grapholides was evaluated against a placebo in 59 patients withcommon cold. Twelve 100 mg tablets of Andrographis paniculata were given to 33 patients, whereas 28 patients received similar-looking placebo tablets containing glucose for 4 days. On day 4,there was a significant reduction in the intensity of sore throat,tiredness, muscular ache, and the intensity of the disease in thedrug-treated group but not in the placebo group. 10 In another randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study, 50 patients with initial symptoms of common cold and sinusitis wereincluded in the study and received either Andrographis paniculata or similar-looking placebo tablets. The preparation used in the studycontained 85 mg of hydro-alcoholic extract standardized forandrographolide and deoxyandrographolide content and was taken ina dose of 4 tablets thrice daily for 5 days. Of the total patients, 67.5percent in the drug group felt totally recovered compared to 36 per - cent in the placebo group. In the case of sick leave the drug grouptook 0.21 days of leave compared to 0.96 days in the placebo group. 11 In a pilot double-blind study during winter to evaluate the potential preventive effects in common cold of Andrographis paniculata' s dried-extract tablets, 107 children around 18 years of age wererecruited. Fifty-four students received two 100 mg tablets of Andro - graphis paniculata for 3 months, which had been standardized to contain 5.6 mg of andrographolide, whereas the other group with112 AYURVEDIC HERBS53 students received 2 tablets containing 100 mg glucose. Students were evaluated weekly. There was no difference between the twogroups in the number cases with cold in the first 2 months, but afterthe third month there was a significant decrease in the number of cases with cold in the drug-treated group, with 35 percent catching cold as compared to 62 percent in the placebo group. 12 In a double-blind placebo-controlled study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of the extract in reducing signs and symptoms of com - mon cold, 158 patients were recruited who completed the study. Thedrug group of 79 patients received 1,200 mg /H11080day /H110021ofAndrographis paniculata herb extract standardized to contain a minimum of 5 mg andrographolide and deoxyandrographolide, that is, four 100 mg tab - lets three times a day, and the placebo group with 79 patients received an equivalent amount of placebo tablets for a period of 5 days. After the second day of treatment, there was a significant decrease in theseverity of exhaustion, sleeplessness, sore throat, and nasal secretion,whereas on day 4, there was a significant decrease in all symptoms intheAndrographis paniculata group\u2014headache, earache, phlegm, and frequency and intensity of cough. 13 Two other double-blind placebo-controlled trials, a pilot study with 46 patients and a phase-III study involving 179 patients with un-complicated URTI, found that throat symptoms showed the most sig-nificant improvement. 14 In a randomized double-blind comparative study in 152 adult pa- tients with pharyngotonsilitis, the efficacy of the powdered leaves ofAndrographis paniculata encapsulated in 250 mg and 500 mg cap - sules was evaluated against 325 mg paracetamol capsules in reducing the incidence of sore throat and fever. Patients were randomized and asked to take 3 capsules four times a day. After 3 days of treatment,the crude drug at 6 g/H11080day /H110021was found as effective as paracetamol in control of fever and sore throat after 7 days; clinical effects were notdifferent in the three groups. 15In an open study, treatment with standardized Andrographis paniculata showed reduction, within 48 hours, in the incidence of fever occurring with common cold.16 In two randomized double-blind-controlled clinical studies\u2014a pilot study and second study\u2014Andrographis paniculata was evalu - ated against amantidine in an epidemic of influenza in V olgograd.Respiratory Tract Drugs 113The pilot study involved 540 patients: 71 patients were on a combina - tion drug Kan Jang consisting of 88.8 mg of Andrographis pani - culata and 10 mg of Eleutherococcus senticosus , whereas the control group was on an antiviral drug amantidine, paracetamol, and vitamin C. The Kan Jang therapy significantly reduced the occurrence of fever and clinical symptoms, such as headache, myalgia, and conjunctivitis,postinfluenza complications, and the number of days taken as sickleave was also reduced to 30.1 percent and 31.43 percent compared to67.8 and 70.97 percent in the control group of the pilot and secondstudy. 17 The results of several trials on URTI in which a standardized ex - tract of Andrographis paniculata has been used, with one exception, has been reviewed for safety and efficacy, which shows that there areonly mild and infrequent reports of adverse events. 18For other details see the Chapter 4 monograph \"Andrographis paniculata. \" NOTES 1.The wealth of India, (vol. 1, pp. 264-266).

OTHER PLANTS In an open exploratory study, Ocimum sanctum was taken regu - larly by patients suffering from recurrent cold and URTI in the form of fresh leaves or decoction. It was found to prevent recurrent attackspresumably by stimulating the immune system. Similarly, in a studyof 74 children subject to recurrent URTI, a SidaRespiratory Tract Drugs 115vernonicaefolia was found to have a highly significant effect in re - ducing the frequency of attacks after 12 months of intake, when com - pared to the pretreatment period.1 NOTE 1.

It is characterized by cough, breathlessness, and high eosinophil lev- els Albizzia lebbeck Benth. (Family: Mimosaceae) In an open trial with 35 cases of tropical pulmonary eosinophilia (TPE), 17 patients were treated with 200 mg Albizzia lebbeck (shirish) flower twice daily for 6 weeks, with 82 percent showing excellent re-sults, 12 percent good, and 6 percent showing poor response. No sideeffects or toxicity were observed. 1 Ocimum sanctum Linn. sanctum with diethyl carbamazine was conducted on 48 children with TPE. Patientswere two groups\u2014one receiving sanctum or 10 mg /H11080kg/H11080day/H110021diethyl carbamazine in three or four divided doses for 4 weeks. Both drugs were filled in identicalcapsules and the trial was conducted in a double-blind manner.Ocimum sanctum was found as effective as diethyl carbamazine in effecting clinical improvement and reduction of blood eosinophillevels, apart from producing similar improvement in radiologicalfindings. Change in eosinophil levels was noticed in the secondweek of therapy when patients were examined and improvement in116 AYURVEDIC HERBSeosinophil levels continued when repeat measurements were carried in the fourth week.2,3 Terminalia belerica Roxb. (Family: Combretaceae) In a comparative trial of 37 children with cough, breathlessness, fever, chest pain, malaise, an eosinophil count of 2,000/H11080cu /H11080mm/H110021, and more than 20 percent differential eosinophil count, 27 patients weregiven 20 mg /H11080kg /H110021body weight of the kernel powder of Terminalia belerica in three divided doses, whereas ten patients received diethyl carbamazine (DEC) as a control drug. There was a significant reduc - tion in the blood eosinophil count after 15 days that was completelynormal after 4 weeks of treatment in comparison with DEC. Six-month follow-up showed that there were no relapses in the Termi- nalia belerica group, but there were relapses in the DEC-treated group. 3 NOTES 1. Shaw BP, Bera B.

With changing lifestyles and diet, as also with increased stressand pollution, cardiovascular diseases are reaching epidemic propor-tions not only in the developed world but also in the developingworld. Plants have been used in Ayurveda for the treatment of heartdisease or Hrdroga, as it is known in Sanskrit, both in the form of a single drug and in combination with other plants. There have beenseveral plants that have been listed in ancient treatises as useful forheart problems since the time of Caraka and Sushruta\u2014authors of thefirst Ayurvedic texts. Several reviews have been published consider-ing the importance of the area. These include plants found useful incardiovascular conditions, 1,2which have been grouped under four categories depending upon their activity, such as cardioprotectiveplants that help in the management of ischemia and angina, 3 antiplatelet plants,4antihyperlipidemic plants,5and antihypertensive plants.6,7Many of these plants can be included in more than one category.

CARDIOPROTECTIVE PLANTS Of the few plants that have been studied, the best investigated is Terminalia arjuna, which has evoked considerable interest since the published report of a poor barber with ischemic heart disease (insuffi- cient blood supply to the heart), owing to a heart block, who was re-lieved of his symptoms and was able to start work again. The barberwas advised a milk decoction of Terminalia arjuna bark twice a day that relieved him of his symptoms. 1Angina pectoris is characterized by pain in the chest due to coronary artery disease (CAD) or narrow-ing of the coronary arteries by deposition of fatty plaques on the wallof the arteries. In Ayurveda, factors causing heart disease and treat-ments for it have been described in the Caraka Samhita. The treat- ment of pain has also been included in it. 2Acute chest pain with breathlessness is described in the Sushruta Samhita.3However, the different kinds of pain because of heart disease have been describedin the Astanga Hrdayam of Vagbhata, who also first use of Terminalia arjuna. 6 in color gallery)is a large evergreen tree found throughout India, especially near waterways. It is alsogrown for its shade. The smooth pink-gray stem bark has been used120 AYURVEDIC HERBSas a medicine for hundreds of years since 700 BC. Mentioned in the Caraka andSushruta Samhita for the treatment of skin conditions, ulcers, fractures, uterine problems, and urinary disorders,5the use of Terminalia arjuna in heart diseases was mentioned for the first time in the Astanga Hrdayam of Vagbhata.6Its use as a cardiotonic in heart problems, especially in the form of a milk decoction, was advocatedby another well-known physician of ancient times known as Cakra - datta or Cakrapanidatta. 7 Constituents isolated from Terminalia bark the following components: tannins; several glyco phenolic leucocyanidin ( amounts of calcium salts. 5,8 Early pharmacological studies using the total extract of Terminalia arjuna showed cardiotonic activity, increasing the force of contrac- tion in frogs9and in dogs.10In a study to investigate the mechanism of action, it was found that the aqueous portion of the alcoholic extract exhibited a lowering of blood pressure and heart rate (bradycardia),which was centrally mediated, 11whereas another study showed that Terminalia arjuna had a depressant action at higher concentration be- cause of its peripheral action.12A significant positive inotropic effect was also shown in rat atria by the aqueous extract,13which has been attributed to the release of noradrenaline from the sympathetic nerveendings, that is by an action on /H9252 1-adrenoreceptors, although the ex- tract caused a relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, which was not mediated by /H92522adrenoreceptors.14Depending upon the solvent used for extraction, the extract is enriched in compounds possessing either positive or negative inotropic action.11,13,14 In isoproterenol ischemia in rats, Terminalia activity inducing coronary vasodilation and hypotension.15The aqueous extract also enhanced coronary flow in isolated perfused rabbit heart preparation.16Powdered bark has been shown in rats to prevent oxidative stress associated with ischemicreperfusion injury. 17In addition, arjunolic acid, a triterpene from the bark, has been shown to exert a protective effect against damageCardiovascular Drugs 121caused by isoproterenol-induced myocardial necrosis.18Terminalia arjuna also has potent antioxidant activity19and has a favorable effect on coronary risk factors such as hyperlipidemia, lowering cholesterol levels in rabbits fed a high-fat diet.20-25The lipid-lowering effect has been shown to occur through inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis inthe liver and increased excretion of bile acid. There is also an in - creased activity of the enzyme responsible for lipid metabolism inthe body\u2014plasma lecithin, cholesterol acytransferase activity, andstimulation of the for the destruction of low-density lipoprotein. 26Terminalia arjuna bark 50 percent methanolic extract, at a dose level of 250 and 500 mg /H11080kg/H110021, reversed the abnormal platelet adhesiveness and the incidence of ECG abnormalities inhypercholesterolemic rabbits, 27and at the same dose level improved the endothelial function.28 A number of studies have investigated the use of Terminalia arjuna; most of them have been in the area of angina and ischemic heart disease, one in congestive heart failure, a few cases of ventricu-lar arrhythmias, in its antioxidant capacity and in the control ofhyperlipidemia. One of the first studies that triggered interest in theuse of Terminalia arjuna was conducted in 1951. 29 Angina pectoris In an open trial, 25 patients with angina pectoris were given 500 mg ofTerminalia arjuna bark extract twice a day in addition to their usual antianginal drugs for 3 months. When evaluated at the end of1 and 3 months, respectively, it was found that the exercise toleranceincreased and the treadmill grading had significantly improved.There was, however, no reduction in the consumption of antianginaldrugs and the drug was well tolerated and no side effects were ob - served. 30Details are not available regarding the extraction solvent used for preparation of the bark extract. In another open trial with 15 stable and 5 unstable angina patients, Terminalia arjuna was given for 3 months, at the end of which, in the stable angina group, there was a significant improvement in angina,decrease in blood pressure, and improvement in exercise toleranceincreased as indicated by the delay in onset of angina on a treadmilltest. In unstable angina patients, there was only an insignificant122 AYURVEDIC HERBSchange in anginal frequency. No adverse effects were seen on liver and kidney functions.31 In another open trial, 29 patients with angina pectoris were adminis - tered 600 mg of Terminalia arjuna b a r kp o w d e r .I n1 7T r e a dM i l lT e s t (TMT) positive cases, improvement seen was evaluated as 20.3, 57, and67 percent reduction of symptoms after 20, 40, and 60 days of treatment,whereas in TMT negative cases greater improvement was seen with30.4, 47, and 68 percent reduction of symptoms, respectively. 32 In a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study, 58 male pa - tients with chronic stable angina NYHA class II-III, who showedprovocable ischemia on exercise, were given 500 mg of Terminalia arjuna 90 percent alcohol extract 8 hourly, isosorbide nitrate 40 mg daily, or a matching placebo for 1 week each after a wash-out periodof 3 days in a randomized double-blind cross-over fashion. All pa-tients were evaluated clinically at the end of each week of therapyapart from biochemical and treadmill exercise evaluation. Patients onTerminalia arjuna extract showed improvement both in clinical pa- rameters and exercise tolerance, which was similar to isosorbidemononitrate when compared to placebo. 33 Congestive heart failure Properly evaluated plants can be useful in the long-term treatment of chronic heart failure (inadequate heart function causing insuffi-cient supply of oxygen and nutrients to the lungs and extremities). Inan early study ten patients with congestive heart failure, who wereclassified as being in NYHA Class I (one patient), Class II (five pa-tients), and Class III (four patients), were given 4 g of powderedTerminalia arjuna bark twice a day before food for 1 month, which caused a significant diuresis (p < 0.01). All patients showed im - provement in their functional class, breathlessness, and overall feel - ing of well-being and comfort. In addition, there was a fall in bothsystolic and diastolic blood pressure. 34 In a double-blind placebo-controlled study, 12 patients with severe refractory heart failure, NYHA Class IV , were given either 500 mgofTerminalia arjuna bark extract 8 hourly or a matching placebo for 2 weeks each as an adjuvant, in addition to the patients' intakeof digoxin, diuretics, ACE-inhibitors, vasodilators, and 2 weeks there was a wash-out period for 2 weeks, before the cross-over preparation was administered. All pa - tients experienced breathlessness during rest period or after minimal activity. Baseline evaluation was carried out for both clinical and lab - oratory parameters, in addition to an echocardiogram at the start ofthe trial, after Terminalia arjuna and placebo treatment. There was an improvement in dyspnea, fatigue, edema, and the walking distancewhen patients were on arjuna therapy. At the end of 4 months nine patients had improved to Class II, whereas three patients hadimproved to Class III. In the second open phase of the trial all patientswere continued on arjuna therapy (500 mg every 8 hours) for about 2 years in addition to their other drugs (flexible diuretic, vasodilator,and digitalis), and patients continued to show improvement in signsand symptoms, exercise tolerance, NYHA class, and quality of life. 35 Coronary artery disease In two cases of ventricular premature contractions associated with coronary artery disease, Terminalia arjuna powder 500 mg was given thrice a day, and ventricular premature contractions disappeared inboth cases. 36 In an open study, ten patients of postmyocardial infarction angina (post-heart attack chest pain) and two patients of ischemic cardio-myopathy (disease of the heart muscle causing weakened force ofcontraction) were treated with 500 mg of Terminalia arjuna stem bark powder 8-hourly for 3 months in addition to the conventionaltreatment of nitrates, aspirin, and/or calcium channel blockers. An - other group of 12 patients with postmyocardial infarction angina, who were only on conventional treatment, served as controls. Bothgroups showed a significant reduction in anginal frequency; however,only the Terminalia arjuna group showed a significant reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction and reduction in left ventricular mass, as shown by echocardiogram. In addition, two patients withcardiomyopathy showed improvement in coronary heart failure fromNYHA Class III to Class I. No side effects on the kidney, liver, andblood were seen. 37124 AYURVEDIC HERBSLipid lowering in coronary heart disease In an open trial, 51 cases with coronary heart disease (CHD) were treated with 500 mg of Terminalia arjuna bark powder filled in capsules and given 2 capsules twice daily with milk for 4 months. There was a significant regulation of blood pressure and lipid pro - file in these patients. Patients got considerable symptomatic reliefwith improvement in breathlessness, palpitation, and chest pain after1 month of treatment and there was significant normalization at4 months. 38 In a randomized open trial, 105 patients with CHD were matched for age and disease status and then randomized into three groups.One group received placebo capsules, one group received 400 IU ofvitamin E, and the third group received 500 mg capsules of Arjuna bark powder. Lipid and lipid peroxide levels were determined after30 days of intake. There was no significant change in lipid levels ingroups receiving placebo and Vitamin E, whereas in the arjuna group there was a significant decrease in total cholesterol and LDL choles-terol. In addition, there was a significant reduction in lipid peroxidelevels in both vitamin E and arjuna groups. 39 Terminalia arjuna is well tolerated in the usual dosages of 1-2 g used in clinical trials and considered optimum for the treatment ofcoronary artery disease (CAD). 30, 40Side effects seen are mild\u2014gas tritis, headache, constipation, abdominal discomfort, body ache, nau-sea, and insomnia\u2014 and only in a few patients. 33,35No organ toxicity in liver and kidney,37and no metabolic toxicity has been reported in patients taking Terminalia arjuna for 24 months.35In vitro studies have shown that methanol and acetone extracts of Terminalia arjuna show tall stout herb growing up to 1.5 m in the north - western Himalayas from 1,500 to 4,200 m elevation.42The roots areCardiovascular Drugs 125prized in Ayurveda for their expectorant action in cough and also in breathlessness and chest pain. It is described in the Caraka Samhita as the best drug for precordial pain43and also mentioned in several other formulae, both as a single drug and in combination with otherdrugs for the treatment of heart disease. It is also used internally forthe treatment of tuberculosis and externally for skin problems. Roots of Inula racemosa contain 10 percent inulin and 1.3 percent of an essential oil, which contains several lactones, chiefly alantol - actone and isoalantolactone. 42,44 Inula racemosa has been shown to have a protective effect on ex - perimental myocardial infarction in rats when compared to a controlgroup. 45In addition, it has also been shown to have a negative inotropic and chronotropic effect in frog heart.46 Based on the high regard accorded to Inula racemosa by Caraka in relieving chest pain, it was tried out in a small number of patientswith ischemic heart disease complaining of chest pain and ST-seg-ment depression shown in the ECG on exertion. In an open study,nine patients with ischemic heart disease were treated with 3 g ofInula racemosa root powder taken 90 minutes before testing. At this dosage it prevented postexercise ST depression in all cases, leadingthe authors to conclude that the results were comparable to nitroglyc-erine with enhanced improvement seen with Inula racemosa. 47 In an earlier trial with Commiphora mukul in cases of ischemic heart disease, it was found that patients continued to have precordialpain for periods ranging from 3 to 9 months, despite the intake ofguggul, and requiring the additional use of nitroglycerine to controlpain. 48Therefore, Inula racemosa, which is considered the drug of choice to control chest pain, was added. In an initial trial, a combina - tion of Inula racemosa with Commiphora mukul gum in the ratio of 1:1 was tried on 50 patients with ischemic heart disease at 6 g per dayin three divided doses for 4 months. At the end of the trial period, fivepatients had recovered and had no precordial pain, and the serum cholesterol and ECG were within normal limits. A total of 40 patients showed varying degrees of improvement such as reduction in precor - dial pain and ECG or serum cholesterol levels although five patientsdid not show any improvement at all. A longer treatment period wasexpected to yield the desired results. 49126 AYURVEDIC HERBSThus, two studies have been published by the same institution\u2014 one in which 150 patients50were enrolled and the other with 200 pa - tients.51All patients had precordial pain relieved with nitroglycerine and showed breathlessness and changes in the ST-segment depres - sion and T-wave in the ECG after exercise, which is characteristic of myocardial ischemia. Patients were recruited for the trial and given6-8 g of the 1:1 combination of the drug for a period of 6 months.Cholesterol, triglycerides, and total lipids showed significant fall from the first month onwards. 50At the end of the trial period, of the 200 patients, 25 percent (52 out of 200) had a normal ECG, 59 per - cent showed improvement in ECG, 25 percent (50 out of 200) had no precordial pain, and 69.2 percent patients (110 out of 159) had nodyspnea. 51 To further improve patient comfort, two further combinations were tried out. In the first combination Bacopa monnieri plant juice, which has an anxiolytic effect, made from an equal quantity byweight was added to equal amounts of the powders of Inula racemosa andCommiphora mukul and made into 500 mg pills; 12 such pills were given to 50 patients in divided doses for a period of 6 months and ECG taken for 45 patients. After 6 months, 8 out of 45 patients had no precordial pain and both ECG and lipid levels were normal; 60 per-cent (30 out of 45) of the patients showed improvement in chest pain,in ECG, and serum lipid levels, 8 out of 45 patients improved with re-lief only in precordial pain but not in lipid levels or ECG, whereastwo patients showed no improvement. 52 In the second combination, in addition to Inula racemosa and Commiphora mukul, Centella asiatica andHypericum perforatum were added to allay anxiety and depression in 406 patients with oneor more risk factors for CHD. The formulation consisted of 500 mgof total extracts per capsule combined in the following ratio: each20 mg of the combination contained Inula racemosa perforatum leaf extract\u20142 mg /H11080kg/H110021. The drug combination was administered in a dose of 20 mg /H11080kg/H110021in divided doses for 6 months. A control group consisting of 57 males and 28 females were kept on placebo. Thedrug-treated group showed significant improvement in nervousness,Cardiovascular Drugs 127sleeplessness, tremors, irritability, and fatigue. In addition, there was a decrease in both diastolic and systolic blood pressure, correction intotal cholesterol, and increase in HDL-cholesterol ratio in the treatedgroup, but not in the placebo group. 53 Larger doses of Inula racemosa have a laxative effect.54In a 1:1 combination with Commiphora mukul it showed no adverse effect when given to 250 patients with CHD to assess the effect on bodycomposition. 55 NOTES 1.

HYPOLIPIDEMIC PLANTS Lipid levels are considered to be a risk factor for several diseases, including heart problems. Over 50 plants are used in Ayurveda to lower lipid levels.1The etiopathology of obesity and associated lipid disorders have been described in a very comprehensive manner in theSushruta Samhita, 2and its parallel to modern theories of the develop- ment of atherosclerosis was noticed by Dr. Satyavati and Dr. Dwara-kanath in the literature as Commi - phora mukul (see Plate 7 in color gallery), is a small to medium-sized tree found in the arid regions of India. It is cultivated in Rajasthan and Gujarat. The tree has a papery bark, and when an incision is made inthe bark, a thin yellow gum oozes out, quickly solidifies, and is col - lected and purified. This gum resin has been used medicinally for along time in Ayurveda, spanning several hundred years. It was firstmentioned in the Atharva veda, then in the first texts of Ayurveda, the Caraka Samhita, andSushruta Samhita, and later in numerous other texts, for its effectiveness on the heart, obesity, and diabetes. 4Scien - tific investigation on Commiphora wightii has centered mainly on the anti-inflammatory effect and its hypolipidemic effect, for which it isan official drug in the Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia, 2002. 5 InSushruta Samhita, there is a description of the changes that oc- cur in cases of obesity, which remarkably parallels the modern inter-pretation of the etiology and pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. 6,7The Sushruta Samhita also deals with the treatment of obesity and of lipid disorders, and the consequences associated with the various condi-tions. However, the age of the resin is considered to play an importantrole in the kind of effect produced\u2014an old sample being useful in re-ducing body weight and lipid levels, whereas a new sample of thegum can have the reverse effect. 7The crude gum also needs to be pu- rified, as described in ancient texts, by boiling in a decoction oftriphala ) in order to free it from side effects such as skin rashes, diarrhea, irregular menstruation, restlessness, and hiccup. 7 The gum resin has a complex composition with approximately 0.4 percent of an essential oil containing myrecene, dimyrecene, sev - eral steroids, Z- and for thehypolipidemic properties, and guggulsterols I-VI. Sesamin and cho - lesterol are found as well. 4,5 The cholesterol-lowering properties of the crude gum resin and various fractions have been studied extensively over the years. Thefirst report in 1966 showed that the crude gum could protect choles - terol-fed rabbits against atherosclerosis and also significantly reduceserum cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolemic rabbits, 8apart from a reduction in the body weight of the treated animals.9The132 AYURVEDIC HERBShypocholesterolemic effect has been shown by other workers in several species of experimental animals.7,10The activity has been found to be in the steroid fraction, especially in the two ketonic ste - roids Z- and E-guggulsterones.11The two guggulsterones have also been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation.12 Several theories have been propounded to explain the hypo - lipidemic activity of the gum resin. Guggulsterone exhibits potent an - tioxidant activity13and reversed myocardial by isoproterenol in rats.14The gum resin15,16and Z- guggulsterone17have been shown to stimulate the thyroid, and the gum has also beenshown to induce triidothyronine production. 18In addition, Z-gug- gulsterone acts as an Bile Acid Receptor (BAR) antagonist19and also as an antagonist of farnesoid X receptor FXR;20this may contribute to the cholesterol-lowering activity of the guggulsterones and of thegum resin. Several trials have been conducted on the gum resin of Commiphora mukul, the so-called fraction A, and on guggulipid, which is the standardized ethyl acetate fraction of Commiphora mukul containing 2.5 percent guggulsterones developed at the Cen- tral Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, India. Gum guggul In preliminary open clinical trials, guggul was given in doses of 12-16 g per day to 22 patients with hypercholesterolemia associated with disorders such as obesity, ischemic heart disease, hypertension,etc. for a period of 12 weeks. At the end of the treatment period, itwas observed that there was a fall in cholesterol levels by 33 percentin 96 percent of the cases, fall in triglycerides by 32.7 percent in 88percent cases, decrease in free fatty acids by 62 percent, and decreasein serum phospholipids by 40 percent. In addition, there was a de - crease in the body weight of ten patients by 1.4 kg every month. 8 Gum guggul was also tried on 12 patients with elevated lipid levels\u20149 patients were obese, 2 had ischemic heart disease, and 1 pa - tient had cerebral thrombosis. Treatment with guggul lowered the serum turbidity and prolonged the coagulation time.21 Other trials with gum guggul were held on patients with obe - sity/hyperlipidemia at several centers and confirmed the significantCardiovascular Drugs 133lowering of not only the serum cholesterol level, triglycerides, and total lipids but also of nonesterified fatty acids.22-25Two of these trials also compared the efficacy of Fraction A with gum guggul.22,23A sig - nificant increase in HDL cholesterol has also been reported apartfrom lowering of other lipid parameters. 26 Fraction A Petroleum ether extraction of guggul led to three fractions named A, B, and C, of which fraction A was found to have the maximumlipid-lowering action in chicks 27and therefore was subjected to clini - cal trials. In a clinical study with 44 patients, fraction A was com- pared with clofibrate and an experimental drug from Ciba. In 20 pa- tients 0.5 g fraction A was given twice a day for periods varying from6 to 34 weeks. In the trial, patients were randomly assigned to receiveone of the drugs. On analysis, fraction A was found to lower the se-rum levels of total lipids, triglycerides, cholesterol, phospholipids,and beta lipoprotein. In addition, the lowering of triglycerides wasbest in fraction A of guggul. Side effects observed with fraction A were hiccups (1 patient), diarrhea (3 patients), and restlessness andapprehension (1 patient). 28 In a long-term study, 41 cases of hyperlipoproteinemia were treated with 0.5 g of fraction A thrice daily for 75 weeks with 10 caseso n2g /H11080day /H110021of clofibrate also for 75 weeks serving as a comparative control. The reduction seen with fraction A was statistically signifi-cant for the entire treatment period. The reduction of cholesterol was26.2 percent with guggul as against 31.5 percent with clofibrate, whereas for triglycerides the reduction for guggul was 36.5 percent as against 33.3 percent for clofibrate. Side effects such as diarrheawere seen in five patients. 29 This was also borne out in a clinical study on 40 obese, 40 hyper - cholesterolemic, and 40 hyperlipemic patients. The effect of gumguggul 2 g thrice daily or fraction 'A' 0.5 g twice daily was studied. Fraction A was able to significantly reduce the serum cholesterol andserum lipids in 21 days, in a manner similar to clofibrate. 23 In another double-blind cross-over study with fraction A, again with a dose of 1.5 g/H11080 day/H110021for 4 weeks at a time, in 48 hypercholesterolemic patients with a mean level of 280 mg percent of cholesterol brought134 AYURVEDIC HERBSabout a significant reduction of total cholesterol, total lipids, and tri - glycerides.30 Studies on human beings and on experimental animals to elucidate the mechanism of action of fraction A showed that there was mobili - zation of cholesterol from the tissues, a decrease in its synthesis, and increased excretion of cholesterol leading to a fall in cholesterol levels.31 Guggulipid Guggulipid is the standardized ethyl acetate extract of gum guggul. It has been suggested that the hypolipidemic effect of guggulipid is dependent upon the etiology of the disease with nondiabetic hyperlipidemic patients being benefited with significantlowering of cholesterol, triglycerides, total lipids, and beta lipopro-tein, whereas no such effect was seen in diabetic patients. 32 In a phase I safety study, 400 mg guggulipid administered thrice a day for 4 weeks to 21 patients of primary hyperlipidemia was shown to be without any adverse effect on liver function, blood sugar, blood urea, hematological parameters, and ECG. There was also a signifi- cant lowering of cholesterol and/or triglycerides in 15 patients at theend of 4 weeks. 33 In a comparative cross-over trial, guggulipid (500 mg every 8 hours) was evaluated against clofibrate (500 mg every 8 hours) in30 patients of primary hyperlipidemia and judged to have better hypolipidemic activity than clofibrate. 34A dosage of 500 mg of guggulipid was given thrice a day for 6 weeks to evaluate its useful - ness in 22 patients of primary hyperlipidemia. The serum cholesterol levels were significantly lowered in 59 percent of patients, the effectbeginning to be seen after 2 weeks and reaching a maximum in 4-6weeks. The fall in cholesterol levels and triglycerides was 24.5 and 27 percent, respectively. There was a return to pretreatment values within 6 weeks of stopping the drug. The drug was well tolerated. 35 In 25 patients with nephrotic syndrome, 75 mg three times a day of guggulipid was given for 12 weeks. HDL cholesterol levels increased after 8 weeks, although significant changes in the electrocardiogramwere seen only after 12 weeks of therapy. 36Cardiovascular Drugs 135In a randomized double-blind trial in 61 patients with hypercholes - terolemia, 31 on guggulipid and 30 on placebo, patients were given 50 mg of guggulipid or placebo capsules for 24 weeks along with a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. Guggulipid decreased the total cho - lesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio by approximately 11-12 percentwith no changes being observed in the placebo group. Lipid perox - ides also decreased by about 33 percent in the guggulipid group,whereas the placebo group remained unchanged. The HDL choles - terol level was unchanged in both groups. After a wash-out period ofanother 12 weeks, changes in lipoproteins were again reversed in theguggulipid group, with no changes being observed in the placebogroup. The overall impression was that the combined effect of dietand guggulipid was equal to that of modern drugs. 37 In another randomized-controlled trial38guggulipid was given in two dose levels three times a day of 1,000 mg and 2,000 mg or match-ing placebo in 103 cases of hyperlipidemia for 8 weeks. It was found that there was an increase in LDL cholesterol in both 1,000 mg as well as 2,000 mg dosage groups when compared to placebo wherethere was a decrease. It appears that there was no favorable effect onlipid levels. The dose given is much above the dosage for guggulipid,although standard doses were also tried out. In addition, six patientson guggulipid showed skin rashes reduced by prior processing of the gum to remove impurities. 9Skin rashes are also encountered when larger doses are used. The age of the resin is considered to play an im - portant role on lipid-lowering activity levels and needs to be takeninto consideration. 7 Coronary artery disease In an exploratory trial, gum guggul fraction A was given at a dose of 500 mg twice a day to both healthy subjects and coronary artery patients. In healthy subjects, it produced a 22-percent increase in se - rum fibrinolytic activity within 24 hours of administration, whereas itincreased to 40 percent after 30 days. In coronary artery patients, itwas found that the serum fibrinolytic activity increased by 19 percentafter 24 hours and reached 33 percent after 30 days. A reduction in136 AYURVEDIC HERBSthe platelet adhesive index by 19 and 16 percent in healthy controls and in patients, respectively, was also seen.39 In another study, of the 42 patients with coronary artery disease, only 21 patients were given 1.5 g of Commiphora mukul every day, whereas the remaining patients were not. It was found that patientsreceiving the drug showed reduction of euglobin lysis time and in - crease in fibrinolytic activity, whereas controls did not show anychange in these parameters. There was no significant change inplatelet aggregation. 40 Ischemic heart disease In a trial, 135 patients with ischemic heart disease and symptoms of precordial pain, dyspnea on effort, history of angina, or previoushistory of myocardial infarction were included. Of these, 110 pa-tients served as the treatment group, and 25 patients were kept as thecontrol group. The clinical profile and changes in serum lipids wereevaluated at monthly intervals for the various parameters, whereasECG was evaluated before and after treatment. Purified guggul pow- der was given in a dose of 8 g/H11080day /H110021for 3 months. There was a fall in lipid parameters comparable to clofibrate. Precordial pain and dyspneaalso improved and grades I and II patients became absolutely free ofthe symptoms. Patients of grade III and IV also showed improve-ment. There was a reduction in weight of an average of 1 kg/H11080month /H110021. ECG changes were seen in seven cases with improvement in S-T seg-ment depression and inversion of T-wave in patients of long-standingischemia. 41 Side effects associated with guggul are generally gastrointestinal in nature, reduced by purification of the resin and seen more oftenwith larger dosages. 4These include diarrhea, skin rashes, headache, irregular menstruation, and restlessness.7It has been shown not to have acute, subacute, and chronic toxicity in rats, dogs, and monkeys.Since it increases menstrual discharge it is not to be taken duringpregnancy. 5Guggul inhibits platelet aggregation,12and is probably best avoided with other blood thinning agents. Guggulipid given ata dose level of 400 mg thrice a day for 4 weeks showed no adverseeffect on liver function, blood sugar, blood urea, and hematologicalparameters. 33Cardiovascular Drugs 137Considering the variable nature of the preparation used in the dif - ferent trials, it would be useful to conduct trials with well-defined material, along with dosage studies. It would be important to takeinto account the age of the resin, since old resin is said to have a bene - ficial effect on obesity as mentioned in the Sushruta Samhita. 7,42 Thus, it would be necessary to identify components that may be re - sponsible for having a reverse effect of increasing lipid See Chapter 11 for an introduction to fenugreek. Fenugreek seeds have been shown to reduce lipid levels in a number of experimental animals such as rats, dogs, and rabbits.43-50There was significant re- duction of serum cholesterol levels (p < 0.00005) in both normal (42 percent) and hypercholesterolemic (58 percent) rats on feeding witha diet of 50 percent Trigonella foenum-graecum seeds. 43The saponin fraction that interacts with the bile salts has been shown to reducecholesterol levels in rats. 45,46In rats the ethanol extract contains hypocholesterolemic constituents like saponins, which led to a 18-26percent reduction in plasma cholesterol. 46In dogs the lipid extract had no effect on cholesterol levels, but the fiber-rich (53.9 percent) andsaponin- containing (4.8 percent) defatted portion showed significantreduction of cholesterol levels in normal and in hypercholesterolemicdogs. 48A principle isolated from the aqueous extract showed hypo hypocholesterolemic, and hypotriacylglycerolemic activi - ties in hyperlipidemic rabbits.49Different levels of fenugreek and ex - tracts were tried on rabbits both in normal animals and thosepretreated with a high fat diet. Plasma cholesterol levels were re - duced in both groups; however, reduction in triglyceride levels wasseen only in the high fat diet group when animals were treated with30 percent of diet enriched with seed powder or extracts; changes incholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL cholesterol were seen. There was138 AYURVEDIC HERBSno change in HDL cholesterol but the ratio of HDL to LDL changes favorably.50 Clinical studies have demonstrated the beneficial effect of fenu - greek seeds in hyperlipidemic patients and in diabetic patients. Fortrials on diabetic patients see Chapter 11, \"Antidiabetic agents.\" In an open exploratory trial 10 hyperlipidemic patients were given isocaloric diets with or without the addition of 100 g of debitterizedfenugreek powder for 20 days. Patients receiving a diet with addedfenugreek showed significant reduction in total serum cholesterol,LDL, VDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. HDL cholesterol didnot change but ratios with respect to total cholesterol and LDL andVLDL showed a favorable change. 51 In patients with mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia,52fenu- greek seeds were able to reduce cholesterol levels. In another opentrial, 20 hypercholesterolemic patients, ages 50-65 years, weregiven germinated fenugreek seeds powder in packets of 12.5 g and18 g to incorporate daily one packet into any food of their choicefor 1 month. It was found that fasting blood levels taken one daybefore the start of the trial and after the treatment period of 1month showed significant reduction of total cholesterol and LDLlevels at the 18 g dose level, although there was a hypolipidemiceffect at both levels. No significant change in HDL, VLDL, andtriglyceride levels was seen in any of the patients. Germinationwas found to bring about definite changes in the soluble fiber con-tent of the seeds. 53 In a single blind trial with placebo control, 18 hypercholestero- lemic patients were divided into three groups and were given 50 gpackets of defatted deodorized fenugreek seed powder (FG), 50 gplacebo powder, or 25 g placebo powder plus 25 g FG powder tobe taken orally before lunch and dinner for 20 days. Lipid profileswere checked with fasting blood samples on 0, 10, and 20 days.Significant changes in total cholesterol, triglycerides, and VLDLlevels were seen in both the fenugreek groups as compared to pla - cebo. 54 The safety of fenugreek is covered in Chapter 11 \"Antidiabetic agents.\"Cardiovascular Drugs 139NOTES 1.

Indian PLANTS Emblica officinalis use of the fruits Emblica officinalis (see Plate 1 in color gal- lery) in the treatment of acidity, gastritis, dyspepsia, and acid peptic ulcer has already been dealt with in Chapter 3, \"Gastrointestinalagents.\" Experiments on small animals, notably rabbits, have shownthat fruits of Emblica have a beneficial effect on cholesterol levels in atherosclerosis 1-3in the serum, aorta, and liver.4Rabbits that were made hypercholesterolemic by cholesterol feeding and a fat-rich dietwere then fed 5 ml /H11080kg /H110021body weight of fresh Emblica officinalis juice per day for 60 days. Serum cholesterol fell by 82 percent, tri - glycerides by 66 percent, phospholipids by 77 percent, and LDL lev - els by 90 percent. In addition, tissue lipid levels and aortic plaques showed reduction.5Flavonoids from Emblica have been shown to ex - ert a very potent hypolipidemic and hypoglycemic effect in rats6by reducing synthesis and increasing the degradation of cholesterol.7 In an open study, supplementation of the diet of normal and hypercholesterolemic men aged 35-55 years with Emblica officinalis for 28 days showed that both groups of subjects showed a decrease in cholesterol levels, which rose to initial values 2 weeks after the with - drawal of supplementation.8Further studies need to be carried out.

ANTIHYPERTENSIVE PLANTS Plants are not the first line of treatment for hypertension; however, the use of Rauwolfia serpentina led to the isolation of reserpine as an antihypertensive, which has now fallen into disuse because of the side effects of the molecule. Nonetheless, the search for possibleherbs for treatment of a perennial herb, which is found throughout India in the plains and in the subtropical Himalayan region. Other species of Coleus are used in Ayurveda,1and there is a divided opinion on this species being mentioned in the traditional texts. The144 AYURVEDIC HERBSdrug with the Sanskrit name Makandi is mentioned in various texts starting from about 1340 AD with the Raj Nighantu and it being equated with Coleus forskohlii.2It is used by tribals externally for skin problems, boils, eczema, cough, and as a tonic. The plant has tu - berous roots that are used as a vegetable and also used medicinally. A labdane diterpene, coleonol, better known as forskolin, was isolatedfrom the roots and shown to have antihypertensive and positiveinotropic effect. Forskolin has been shown to have significant hypo - tensive activity in anesthetized cats and rats and also in hypertensiverats because of the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. 3,4,5 In an exploratory trial, 14 patients with hypertension were treated with 100-200 mg of Coleus forskohlii root powder taken thrice a day. Out of 14 patients, 13 responded to the treatment within 4-15 days.6 Another pilot study revealed that using ethanolic extract of Coleus forskohlii in 23 patients at a dose of 165 mg extract per capsule taken thrice a day for 3 weeks brought down both systolic and diastolicblood pressure. Therefore, the group was increased and 37 patientswere divided into two groups: the first group of 28 patients received1 capsule thrice a day and the other group of 9 patients with bloodpressure levels of 190 mm systolic and 100 mm diastolic received2 capsules thrice a day for 6 weeks. The blood pressure fell continu-ously for 5 weeks after which no further fall was seen. There was alsodecrease in serum cholesterol, creatinine, and in blood urea. It wasestimated that most patients required 15 mg/H11080 day /H110021of coleonol (fors- kolin) to be present in the extract, although patients with higher bloodpressure required 30 mg /H11080day /H110021. The drug was well tolerated and no major side effects were observed.7The results obtained warrant fur - ther studies with controls and larger patient numbers. Coleus forskohlii roots are eaten in North India for the treatment of cough.1In the clinical trial using standardized extract of roots no ma - jor side effects were seen.7 NOTES 1.

VENOUS DISORDERS There are two kinds of veins that help return blood to the heart\u2014 the superficial veins, which constitute 10 percent, and deep-seated veins, which constitute 90 percent. The superficial veins have valvesthat if not working can lead to stagnation of blood, pain in the legs,twisted contorted veins, and edema. Inadequate return of blood istermed venous insufficiency, which can lead to varicosity of veins orvaricose veins. This can stem from lack of movement either becauseof the sedentary nature of work involving sitting at the desk or fromprofessions involving long hours of standing. 8 in color gallery) is a slender, creep - ing herb found in moist areas. The plant and the leaves are used medicinally for a variety of conditions. However, Centella asiatica is146 AYURVEDIC HERBSbest known in India as a mental rejuvenator (medhya rasayana) or memory tonic for reducing mental fatigue and improving mental clarity. For details see Chapter 12, \"Central nervous system agents.\"It has also been used extensively for improving skin conditions of varied etiology and for healing of wounds and ulcers, both internally and externally. See Chapter 9 for its effect on wound healing. It is tra - ditionally used for improving blood circulation and reduction ofedema stemming from debility. 2,3 The major chemical constituents are and asiaticoside\u2014 and acids, and an alkaloid hydrocotyline have been isolated. 4 Scientific studies based on clinical and pharmacological data have shown that it is useful in venous hypertension, venous insufficiency, and in varicose veins since it is useful in lowering levels of lysosomalenzymes that are considered responsible for valvular damage. 5The triterpene glycoside, asiaticoside, has been shown to hasten woundhealing by increasing collagen I synthesis. 6Most of the trials have been conducted with the total triterpene fraction (TTFCA) or the ti-trated extract of Centella asiatica containing 30 percent asi- atic acid, 30 percent madecassic acid, and 40 percent asiaticoside; however, a lipid preparation with Centella asiatica as major compo- nent has been recommended for capillary fragility. 7 Extracts of Centella asiatica showed a positive effect on mucopolysaccharide metabolism when tried on patients with vari- cose veins. Basal levels of uronic acids and lysosomal enzymes areelevated in varicose vein patients, which indicate an increased mucopolysaccharide turnover in these patients. Treatment with 60 mg /H11080day /H110021for 3 months of the active triterpenic fraction led to low - ering of elevated values of uronic acid and lysosomal enzymes result - ing in improved vein tonicity, vein dispensability, and decrease insubjective complaints in 80 percent patients with venous insuffi - ciency of the lower limbs. 8 In a single-blind placebo-controlled trial, 89 patients with venous hypertension microangiopathy were treated with Centella asiatica extract. It was found that there was significant difference from the placeboCardiovascular Drugs 147of all the parameters tested,9so that it was possible to distinguish between 60 and 120 mg daily.10Several models have been used to test the effect of Centella asiatica extract at two different dosage levels against placebo in venous hypertension and are reported in the October 2001 issue of Angiology.11Symptoms of venous hypertension such as ankle edema, pain and cramps, tiredness, and restless lower extremi - ties improved in the treated groups on 30 and 60 mg of Centella asiatica extract (TTFCA) thrice a day.12 In another study, 10 normal subjects, 22 with moderate superficial venous hypertension, and 12 with postphlebitic limbs and severe hy - pertension were studied first for 2 weeks without treatment and thenafter administering 60 mg Centella asiatica extract three times a day for 2 weeks. There was also improvement in capillary permeability inpatients both with moderate superficial venous hypertension and se-vere venous hypertension having ankle and foot edema in the eve-ning. 13 In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 94 patients with chronic venous insufficiency were administered either 60 or 120 mg per day ofCentella asiatica extract (TECA) for 8 weeks. There was improvement in the feeling of heaviness in the limbs, edema, and in vein dis-pensability in the treated group, although vein dispensability increasedin the placebo group. 14 The trials have been conducted using special extract or combina- tions of isolated components. It would be useful to study the effect ofstandardized plant material or simpler whole extracts to extend thescope of usage. Centella asiatica is generally considered safe and has a low degree of toxicity. It is traditionally considered a vegetable and consumed as food.No adverse reactions have been reported in doses commonly used. Nomortality has been reported in mice up to 5 g /H11080kg /H110021body weight.15 NOTES 1. Mumbai: Mumbai: Indian Drug Manufacturers' Association, 2002. 5. Tyler VE.

The various disease conditions of the kidneys and the urinary tract described in Ayurvedahave their closest equivalents in modern parlance to urinary tract remove excess water from the body by increasing uri- nary excretion. This is useful in conditions like high blood pressure,heart failure, glaucoma, edema, nephrotic the Ayurvedic equivalent of di- uretics.2Over 150 plants have been reported to be diuretics.3Plants likeBoerhaavia diffusa andTribulus terrestris are rich in potassium. The herbal diuretics in Ayurveda are considered mild and nontoxic.However, only a few of them have been investigated to some degreeand further long-term studies are Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1300/5683_07 151Boerhaavia diffusa is a spreading plant with a thick perennial root found growing throughout India up to an altitude of 2,000 m. Both the whole plant and the root have been used in medicine for a varietyof conditions; however, it is most widely used in Ayurveda for treatingrenal and urinary problems. The tender shoots are eaten as a vegetable.The plant has traditionally been used to reduce edema associatedwith kidney, heart, gastrointestinal tract disorders, and general debil - ity. In addition, it is a cardiotonic, has laxative and diuretic activity, isuseful in fever, and acts as a rejuvenative or rasayana. It has both diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties and therefore is useful ininflammatory renal diseases. 4The plant has an official status in the Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia, 2002, as a diuretic and hepato- protective agent.5It has been used to treat edema and ascites resulting from early cirrhosis of the liver and in chronic peritonitis. See Pharmacological studies have shown that the plant has both di- uretic6and anti-inflammatory activities6,7with maximum activity being seen in samples collected during the rainy season.4When the various parts of the plant were tested, it was found that the extracts ofleaves and roots showed significantly more anti-inflammatory anddiuretic activities as compared to the whole plant. 8In addition, the alkaloidal fraction has been shown to have immunomodulatory activ - ity.9Punarnava has also been found useful in acute pyelonephritis in albino rats,10and has been found to exhibit a diuretic effect equivalent to furosemide.11 The initial trials were more exploratory in nature with very few pa - tients, inadequate inclusion criteria, and lack of objective end points,which, however, served to give a clinical impression of the nature ofthe drug. The first trial included 5 cases of parenchymatous nephritisalong with 19 cases of dropsy and jaundice, which were treated withBoerhaavia diffusa. It was found that the increase in urine output was accompanied by a decrease in the albumin content, and a decrease in152 AYURVEDIC HERBSspecific gravity of the urine.12Clinical trials to evaluate the diuretic effect of Boerhaavia diffusa were also conducted in 34 patients suf - fering from edema and dropsy because of varied causes using liquid extracts derived from both the dry and fresh plant and found that theywere equally effective in the reduction of edema. 13 A total of 22 patients diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome were randomly allocated to one of two groups and treated with eitherpunarnava crude drug\u2014as powder or in the form of decoction\u2014 or steroids and diuretics in the control group. There were several drop - outs and only 15 patients completed the trial\u201412 in the drug group and 3 in the control group. Of the 12 patients who completed the trial4 patients were relieved and 7 improved, whereas 1 patient showeddeterioration. In the control group, two patients were relieved,whereas one improved. It was observed that the treatment withpunarnava induced a slow and prolonged diuresis, and patients had relief in edema and a decrease in albuminuria with increase in protein levels. 14 In an open trial, 40 patients with nephrotic syndrome presenting edema, burning micturition, and albumin in urea were treated withthree 500 mg capsules of fresh powder of Boerhaavia diffusa given thrice a day for 1 month. It was found that there was an increase in se-rum protein level and a reduction in urinary protein excretion in pa-tients. Of the 27 patients who were severely anemic before the start ofthe trial 6 came into the normal range. There was a moderate decreasein blood urea and a significant reduction in serum creatinine concen - tration, whereas serum protein levels showed an increase. Levels ofserum sodium and potassium showed only marginal changes and thefinal level depended on the initial values, the diet, and the primarycondition of the patients. The level of immunoglobulins also tendedto become normal. 11 The aerial parts of Boerhaavia diffusa are eaten as a vegetable and the plant is well tolerated, although it may show a laxative effect insome patients. 15The drug may cause vomiting in larger doses because of its emetic properties.5,16The acute oral toxicity of a lyophilized de - coction and juice of fresh leaves showed no toxicity in mice up to5g/H11080kg /H110021.17The alcoholic extract of whole plant did not show anyUrinary Tract Drugs 153toxicity in mice up to an oral dose of 2 g/H11080kg/H110021.18No teratogenic effect was seen in experimental animals.19 Further trials are needed with standardized drug, dosage studies, objective parameters, and larger patient numbers since the early stud - ies have served to give an impression of the clinical utility of the drug. Tribulus terrestris is an annual herb found growing throughout In- dia up to an altitude of 5,400 m. The plant has bright yellow flowers appearing after the rains, followed shortly by prickly fruits, which aremedicinally important. The fruits are best known in Ayurveda fortheir diuretic action, and are thus considered helpful in burningmicturition, chronic cystitis, and in expelling renal and urinary cal-culi. 20The fruits are also used as an aphrodisiac for promoting strength and in heart problems.21The dried ripe fruits have the official status in the Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia, 2002, as a diuretic and an antiurolithiatic agent.22 The fruits contain several steroidal saponins such as terrestrosins A, B, (terrestiamide);tannins; and fixed oil. The saponins in the leaves and roots have ahigh hemolytic index, but are absent in the stems and seeds. 20,22 Studies conducted in several experimental animals have shown di - uretic activity.23-25 In an open trial, 75 patients with mild to moderate hypertension (140-179 mm Hg systolic and 90-109 mm Hg diastolic) were dividedinto three groups of 25 each. Two groups of 25 each, apparently un - der same conditions, were treated with 3 g/H11080kg /H110021in three divided doses of aqueous extract of Tribulus terrestris. Group A received the whole-plant extract, group B the fruit extract, whereas the controlgroup of 25 patients was given a similar dose of lactose for 4 weeks.154 AYURVEDIC HERBSPatients were assessed at the end of every week both for the present - ing symptoms of headache, giddiness, insomnia, etc. and objective parameters such as systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and also uri - nary volume, pulse rate, and serum cholesterol. Both drug-treatedgroups showed a significant fall in both diastolic and systolic bloodpressure, whereas there was no significant change in the placebogroup. There was maximum improvement in headache and giddinessin group A (whole-plant extract), whereas group B (fruit extract)showed improvement in palpitation and swelling. 26 It has been reported that the drug causes toxicity in sheep in Aus - tralia and in South Africa. It has been suggested that this is due to thepresence of the alkaloids harmane and norharmane that accumulatein the body, as a result of which the animals stagger. 27In an experi- ment in India in which 4 lb of fresh Tribulus terrestris was given to goats and sheep and 8 lbs to calves, no toxic effect was observed dur-ing the observation period of 1 month. Similarly during daily feedingof 1 kg plant juice for 8 days to calves and sheep, no toxicity wasseen. 28Some toxicity has also been reported in mice. However, it is considered a safe drug in man.29No side effects were reported in the trial for use as an antihypertensive.26In a clinical trial conducted on 406 patients using the saponin of Tribulus terrestris over a long pe- riod, no toxic effects were seen on blood picture, liver, and kidney.30 NOTES 1.

Chin J Integ Trad West 9 in color gallery) is a deciduous tree found throughout India, well known for its handsome foliage and beautiful cream-colored flowers. The ash-gray stem bark is used inAyurveda for treating urinary disorders both as a single drug and alsoin combination with other drugs. Thus, it has been used for the treat - ment of urinary stones, for benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), andfor treating urinary infections. It is also used to improve appetite andis used both internally and externally to treat rheumatism. However,it is best known for its action on urinary calculi and it has an officialstatus in the Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia, 2002, as an anti - urolithiatic drug. 1 The major constituent is the triterpene lupeol (0.6 percent), which has been shown to have antilithotriptic activity. Other constituents are the al - benign prostatic enlargement or enlargement of the prostate gland leading to difficulty in passing urine is known asmutragranthi in Ayurveda (mutra: urine; granthi: knot or block). Crataeva nurvala is considered useful in mutragatha or various ob - structive conditions of the urinary tract. 2 The bladder function of ten dogs was studied using flow cystometry after treatment with Crataeva nurvala for 40 days, which showed a hypertonic effect against the initial values.3The ethanolic extract of Crataeva nurvala has shown carrageenin-induced edema in experimental animals.4The petroleum ether extract of the stem bark has shown anti-inflammatory activity inacute, subacute, and chronic models of inflammation. 5In addition, lupeol was shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory effect.6, 7 In an open study on 30 patients with prostatic hypertrophy and re- sultant hypotonic bladder, 50 ml stem-bark decoction (prepared byboiling 1 part stem bark with 16 parts water, reducing to one-fourthand filtering) was given twice a day to patients and the bladder func-tion examined using cystometric studies. It was found that patientsexperienced improvement in bladder tone with consequent relief insymptoms such as frequency of urination, incontinence, pain, and re - tention of urine. The force in expulsion of urine was also found to in - crease. In patients exhibiting hypotonia and atonia after prostectomy, the decoction was found to increase bladder tone, whereas improve - ments were also seen in neurogenic bladder. The residual volume ofurine decreases significantly. 3 In an open study with 56 patients with enlarged prostate, 50 were on drug while 6 patients and 10 healthy subjects served as control. A total of 50 patients were treated daily with freshly prepared decoctionofCrataeva nurvala stem bark as described above, dose in Indian measures of 4-6 tolas twice a day (5 tolas = 2 fluid ozs.) for a periodof 6 months. Major presenting symptoms were retention of urine,dribbling, frequent micturition and burning, and difficulty in passing158 AYURVEDIC HERBSurine. Most patients had mild renal insufficiency. The status of pa - tients was evaluated after 3-4 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months of ther - apy. Seventy percent of patients had complete relief in symptoms at the end of 6 months, whereas the remaining patients had considerablerelief. Initially 56 percent of patients showed hypotonia, 36 percent showed hypertonia, and a mere 8 percent were normotonic. However, at the end of 6 months, 75 percent of patients were normotonic withnormal residual urine, whereas 25 percent were hypotonic with resid - ual urine below 50 cc. The action of the drug was considered signifi - cant when compared to the small control group. This has been as - cribed to the action on the bladder musculature and to its anti-inflammatory activity. 4 Urinary stones Stones in the urinary tract are termed asmari in Ayurveda (asmam: stone; ari:enemy; or enemy in the form of stone). There are different kinds of stones described in Ayurveda and comparison of theAyurvedic descriptions with Western literature suggests that theycorrespond to differences in chemical composition. 2 Decoction4, 8ofCrataeva nurvala and extract9,10reduced signifi- cantly weight of stones in experimental animals. In calcium oxalatelithiasis, treatment with the decoction elevated levels of the oxalate-synthesizing liver enzyme glycolic oxidase and lowered the deposi - tion of stone-forming constituents in the kidney. In addition, partial reversal of magnesium excretion prevented stone formation, sincelower levels of increase oxalate deposition. 8The pentacyclic triterpene lupeol has been shown to possess antiuro - lithiatic properties in albino rats at a dose level of 50 mg /H11080kg/H110021. Animals treated with lupeol showed reduced tendency to form stones, and very small stones were dissolved or flushed out.11Lupeol (25 mg /H11080kg/H110021body weight) has been shown to reduce renal excretion of calcium oxalate and also to reduce renal tubular damage as seen bylowered levels of several urinary marker enzymes, which indicate re - nal tissue damage. 12In addition, lupeol has antioxidant activity, which contributes to its protective action against calculosis.13Urinary Tract Drugs 159In an open trial, 46 patients with urinary stone were treated with 50 ml of stem-bark decoction of Crataeva nurvala administered twice a day for varying periods. It was found that 28 patients were spontaneously able to pass the stone in 1-47 weeks, whereas 18 pa - tients had considerable relief in symptoms. The average time forpassing the stones was 16 weeks for all except two patients whoneeded 36 and 47 weeks. The process of expulsion of the stone maybe both due to the action of the drug in reducing the stone size and itsaction on the smooth muscle. 3 A study of urinary electrolytes after 1 month of treatment with C. nurvala was found to alter the relative proportion of urinary electro - lytes involved in calculus formation. Excretion of urinary calciumwas greatly reduced, although that of sodium and magnesium wassignificantly increased. In addition, crystalurea was found reduced in75 percent of patients. 3 Another trial was carried out with 55 patients (calcium oxalate stones) in group A, 15 patients (calcium phosphate nephrolithiasis) ingroup B, and a control group (20 subjects). The decoction of the stembark was given to patients for 12 weeks resulting in considerable re-duction in pain (70.90 percent in group A; 73.33 percent group B),and dysuria (63.63 percent in group A; 53.84 percent in group B),whereas some patients experienced radiological reduction in the sizeof stones (33.33 percent in group A; 35.72 percent in group B). 14 Urinary infection Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a very commonly found condition, and is generally of bacterial origin. Based on symptoms, UTI hasbeen correlated with mutrakrichhra vyadhi in Ayurveda. Symptoms include discomfort associated with urination. 15 In vitro studies showed that Crataeva nurvala extract showed anti - bacterial activity against strains causing urinary infections.16 In an open trial, Crataeva nurvala decoction was given to patients suffering from urinary tract infection for 4 weeks. There was reliefin symptoms and absence of pus cells together with negative cultures insome patients; however, 68 percent continued to test positive for in - fection even while experiencing relief of symptoms. 3160 AYURVEDIC HERBSIn a study, 84 patients with UTI were treated with stem-bark de - coction of Crataeva nurvala. Of the 84 patients 55 percent had com - plete relief and 40 percent showed improvement.17 Thus Crataeva nurvala has several useful properties for urinary tract disorders combined together in one drug and deserves further studies to fully exploit its properties. The decoction of stem and root bark are well tolerated.18 herbal edn., Deshpande Ayurvedic drug of choice in urinary disorders. Indian J Med Res 76 (suppl. December):46-53 (1982). 8-29).

In Ayurveda, several plants have been used to treat inflammation, rheumatism, and arthritis. Tra-ditionally, these are used in combination for treatment, rather than assingle drugs. Pharmacological testing has been carried out, and over69 plants have shown encouraging activity as anti-inflammatoryagents, while 27 have shown definite anti-inflammatory activity. Ofthese, joints, or arthritis, covers many kinds of disor- ders characterized by pain, swelling, and stiffness of the joints, ofwhich the most common is rheumatoid arthritis, afflicting 2-3 per - cent of the population. It is a chronic disorder affecting fingers, wrists, toes, and other areas of the body. It is still not certain as whatcauses the disease. According to modern medicine, various factors, including infection and autoimmune disorders, are considered to playa major role in causing this disease. In Ayurveda, poor digestion is considered the root cause of all dis - ease. An impaired digestion leads to the formation of ama, which gets deposited at various locations, such as the joints, leading to pain \u00a9 2006 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1300/5683_08 163and swelling of the joints. The disease entity amavata described by Caraka corresponds most closely to rheumatoid arthritis, and at - tempts have been made to verify this concept of the cause of this dis - ease owing to faulty digestion by treating patients with digestive stimulants such as ginger, which aid digestion and absorption. Seeunder Zingiber officinale gum resin contains the pentacyclic triterpene acids\u2014boswellic acids\u2014that have been shown to be powerful inhibitors of leukotrienes, which play a major role in the cause and perseverance of inflammation in diseases suchas arthritis, asthma, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, etc. In addi-tion, it also inhibits the enzyme elastase and the enzyme C-3 con-vertase of the complement system; these have been summarized in Chapter 3, \"Gastrointestinal agents.\" Details of the clinical studies were taken from abstracts, inter- views, and reports of conferences, since there are few published pa- pers. The first trials were exploratory in nature and were conductedon 20 patients, 1and then later extended to cover a total of 175 pa - tients2in the age group of 10-50 years, who had been suffering for the past 1-6 years from various musculoskeletal rheumatic disorders ofmoderate to severe intensity, including rheumatoid arthritis and an- kylosing spondylitis, and who had earlier been treated with various antirheumatic drugs. Of the 175 patients, 122 were either bedriddenor incapacitated from doing normal work and suffered from morningstiffness. These patients showed relief in presenting symptoms 2-4weeks after starting the treatment. When 17 of these patients were puton placebo, symptoms recurred within 10 days. Out of the remaining 53 patients, 35 showed good results, whereas18 did not show any ap - preciable response within a week of starting the treatment. None of the patients complained of any side effects. In an open and double-blind cross-over study at the Government Medical College, Patiala, India, 30 patients were selected based onthe criteria enumerated by the American Rheumatic Association andwere treated with 200 mg of Boswellic acids thrice daily for 8 weeks.164 AYURVEDIC rate (ESR), and the rheu - matoid factor were checked after 14 days. Supplementary analgesicssuch as diclofenac sodium were required for the first 2 weeks butcould be stopped subsequently. There was significant improvementin morning stiffness, tenderness, and swelling of various joints and inrestored function. Significant improvements were also seen in theESR and the arthritic score. In long-term studies of more than a year,the acceptability of the drug was found to be good with no side effectsseen. 3,4Similar results were observed in 60 patients.5 Patients with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis showing inflamma- tory activity despite medication were included in two placebo-controlledstudies and the results were evaluated for 81 patients: 39 on the drug and42 on placebo. Joint swelling, joint pain, ESR, C- reactive protein asindicator of inflammation, morning stiffness, patients' estimation ofpain, their general condition, as well as the use of anti-inflammatorydrugs were evaluated before therapy, and after 6 and 12 weeks. Therewas marked improvement in all the investigated parameters in theBoswellia group as compared to the placebo group. 6 In a published survey of a number of open and placebo-controlled trials in 260 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the effect of administra-tion of special extracts of Boswellia serrata H15 consisting of 400 mg tablets given as a dosage of 3 tablets twice or thrice daily was evalu-ated by using different approaches in the different trials. The basis forevaluation included joint swelling, pain, ESR, morning stiffness, ad-ditional anti-inflammatory drugs required, side effects and toleranceto therapy. It was found that the drug produced a significant reductionin swelling, pain, and morning stiffness. In addition, ESR was reducedand patients could reduce the intake of NSAIDS with the added advan - tage of improved health and well-being. 7 In another double-blind pilot study, where 78 patients were re - cruited in 4 centers, the results of 37 patients available at one centerhas been published, which concludes that treatment with H15 did notshow any measurable difference when compared with placebo, andfurther studies with larger patients numbers are required. 8However, it is interesting that patients received a high dose (3,600 mg), muchAntirheumatic Agents 165above that used in earlier positive trials. Further studies including dose-searching studies need to be carried out. Information on safety on Boswellia serrata is covered in Plate 7 in color gallery) is better known for its hypolipidemic effect as a result of the scientific work carried out on it, but in Ayurveda, several combina-tion preparations of the purified gum resin of the tree with other herbsare used for the treatment of rheumatic disorders. More details re-garding the plant, purification, and other aspects of its chemistry areavailable in Chapter 6. A number of studies have been carried out to establish the anti- inflammatory activity of gum guggul. The gum resin has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity 9-11comparable to hydrocorti- sone and butazolidine,9and partially comparable to indomethacin and dexamethasone in experimental animals, the activity being seenin the acidic fraction of the resin. 12The steroidal component of fraction A, obtained by petroleum ether extraction of the resin, showed a pro - nounced antiarthritic effect, better than phenylbutazone and compa - hydrocortisone13and hydrocortisoneacetate.14In mycobacterial adjuvant in experimentalanimals, Commiphora mukul gum fraction A was found to be as ef - fective as phenylbutazone and ibuprofen in reducing joints swelling. 15 The aqueous extract of gum guggul showed significant anti-inflam - matory activity reducing maximal and total edema response in carra - geenan-induced rat paw edema.16Gum guggul lipid extract was eval - uated in both acute and chronic models of inflammation and was166 AYURVEDIC HERBSfound active only in Freund's adjuvant-induced model; however, the doses used, that is 250 mg\u00b7kg/H110021, caused considerable morbidity and morality in infected animals but not in the healthy ones.17 Rheumatoid arthritis Very few clinical studies have been carried out on Commiphora mukul as a single drug for rheumatism, and these have been of a pre - liminary nature. Dose-requirement studies carried out with purifiedguggul, on 35 patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, assessed it to be a digestive and an analgesic agent based on its antirheumatic ac-tivity and its action on the ESR. Also to be evaluated were the side ef- fects and the potential development of drug resistance. 18 In another open study, purified guggul was given to 30 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. It was found that 66.66 percent of patients showed complete remission of the disease, 23.33 percent showed major improve-ment, and 10 percent showed minor improvement. The impression wasthat the drug had anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. 19 The petroleum ether extract known as fraction A was tried on human beings and found to have an anti-inflammatory effect at 500 mg\u00b7kg\u00b7day /H110021.20In a randomized double-blind trial with 60 patients with con- firmed rheumatoid arthritis, the disease modifying potential of gumguggul (group A) 500 mg capsules and a proprietary preparation known as Rhumayog with gold (group B) was tried against Auranofin(group C), which has been a standard drug in the therapy of chronicpolyarthritis and psoriatic polyarthritis. It was found that the disease-modifying effect was seen in both group A taking guggul and group C taking Auronofin with statistically significant improvement in Ritchieindex, degree of morning stiffness, and platelet aggregation; however,therapy with Auronofin is accompanied by many side effects such asdiarrhea, skin eruptions, kidney damage, etc., and must be constantlymonitored by a doctor. 21 Osteoarthritis Osteoarthritis is a common disease of the weight-bearing joints. The cartilage lining the joints degenerates due to wear and tear result - ing in pain, stiffness, and sometimes loss of function. In Ayurveda,Antirheumatic Agents 167this is called sandhigatavata. In another trial, 30 osteoarthritis pa - tients with a score of 2 or more on the Kellegren-Lawrence scale, for at least one knee, were included in the trial. A dosage of 500 mg cap - sule of Commiphora mukul concentrated extract was given thrice a day together with food for 1 month after which there was a significantimprovement in both primary and secondary outcome measures, andthere was continued improvement in the primary outcome measure atthe 2-month marker and also on further follow-up. No side effectswere observed, and it was concluded that Commiphora mukul was a relatively safe drug to reduce symptoms of osteoarthritis. 22 Spondylosis and sciatica In open trials, the effect of purified guggul (4 g\u00b7day/H110021in three di- vided doses) for 21 days has also been tried out in patients of cervicalspondylosis (affecting joints between vertebrae in the neck) and an-kylosing spondylitis (affecting spinal vertebrae and the sacrosiliacjoints). A total of 22 patients took part in the cervical spondylosistrial and 17 in the ankylosing spondylitis trial. The effect of purifiedguggul alone was compared with the effect of a preparation of fresh Vitex negundo leaves fried in oil and applied externally for 15 minutes, and that of the combined effect of guggul and the fried-leaf prepara- tion in a few patients in the three groups. The combination offeredgreater symptomatic relief in both cervical spondylosis and ankylos-ing spondylitis; however, pain relief was better with guggul. 23,24The response to guggul was poor in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. In patients with sciatica (pain along the sciatic nerve affecting but-tocks and thighs, and sometimes extending down the leg and thefoot), when guggul was administered along with katibasti treatment (soaking the area with hot oil for 15-40 minutes), it was found to bevery effective. 25 Plant combinations The clinical effects of combinations of guggul with ginger (sunthi) in rheumatoid arthritis, and the clinical effects of combinations ofguggul with other herbs like Dalbergia lanceolaria andSemecarpus anacardium frozen shoulder, and sciatica have been168 AYURVEDIC HERBSstudied and found to be more effective than the individual herbs alone.26 Considering the importance of Commiphora mukul in the treat - ment of rheumatic disorders in Ayurveda, there is a paucity of clinicaldata to emphasize its importance. In addition, the age of the resin,composition of the drug, and its efficacy profile in different rheu - matic conditions needs to be worked out. Further, experimental stud - ies to find out the mechanism of action of the drug are also required. Information on the safety of guggul is covered in Chapter 6, internally27and its anti- inflammatory since the time of Caraka and Susrutha. Tur- meric has traditionally been used in India for a variety of ailments,including digestion due to its choleretic activity\u2014see Chapter 3,\"Gastrointestinal agents\"\u2014and for the management of asthma\u2014seeChapter 5, \"Respiratory tract drugs.\" The other important propertiesthat have been scientifically investigated include its antioxidant,anticancer, immunostimulant, and antiviral properties. The rhizomeis an official drug in the Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia, 2002, for its anti-inflammatory, stomachic, and tonic properties. 29 Other aspects of turmeric, including distribution and chemical constituents, are covered in Chapter 3, where it is first discussed. Thepharmacology of turmeric has been extensively reviewed, 30-36and tur - meric has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties in thevarious models, including acute, subacute, and chronic models ofinflammation. In an experimental study, examination of petroleumether, alcoholic extract, and aqueous extract of turmeric showed thatthe aqueous extract was the most active when administeredAntirheumatic Agents 169intraperitoneally in an acute model. The essential oil and the curcumins are considered to be among the active constituents show - ing anti-inflammatory activity. Administration via the intraperitonealroute produces better anti-inflammatory activity when compared tothe oral administration of the crude drug powder, owing to the poorabsorption of curcumin. 31However, the serum concentration, extent of absorption, and bioavailability of curcumin can be increasedseveralfold by coadministration of curcumin with piperine, which isa bioavailability enhancer. Thus, in human volunteers when 2 g cur - cumin was coadministered with 20 mg of piperine there was a 2,000percent increase in bioavailability of curcumin. 37 Curcumin has been shown to inhibit a number of different mole- cules involved in inflammation.36It has been shown to inhibit prosta - glandin synthesis,38cyclooxygenase,39and lipoxygenase.40Curcumin is also the COX-2 enzyme. Drugs showingCOX-2 inhibition are currently being advocated by pharmaceuticalcompanies because of their relative lack of side effects on the gastro-intestinal system. Curcumin has been shown to inhibit the release ofboth COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes; with better inhibition of 2 enzyme. 41The relatively weaker action on COX-1 reflects the better GI tolerance of curcumin. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study in dogs with osteoarthritis of the canine elbow, or hip, an extract of Curcuma longa (domestica) andCurcuma xanthorrhiza or placebo was given twice daily for 8 weeks. The test preparation was received by 25 dogs, whereas 29 received the placebo. Although there was no difference inthe peak vertical force, the overall assessment of the efficacy of theinvestigators was statistically significant; the owner's assessmentwas short of statistical significance. 42 There have been no reported trials using the whole drug. However, curcumin has been tried out in studies with small numbers of patientsof rheumatoid arthritis. Considering the potential of the drug, furtherclinical studies are required. In a double-blind, cross-over short-term study for 2 weeks, the anti- rheumatic activity of 1,200 mg\u00b7day /H110021curcumin was evaluated against 300 mg\u00b7day/H110021of phenylbutazone in 18 patients with rheumatoid arthri - tis. There was significant improvement in morning stiffness, walking170 AYURVEDIC HERBStime, and swelling of the joints after 2 weeks of oral curcumin therapy. Neither any side effects nor any change in grip strength, articular in - dex, or ESR was observed in either of the two groups ascribed to theshort period of administration. 43In a continuation of the same trial, the number of patients was increased to 31 and the dose levels were in - creased to 1,800-2,100 mg\u00b7day/H110021and given for longer periods of 5-6 weeks;30however, more details are not available. There was significant improvement in all patients. Similarly, not much detail is available regarding the effect of 1,500 mg\u00b7day/H110021curcumin on patients with osteoarthritis for 4-6 weeks, apart from the reported subjective improvement by the few patientson whom it was tried. 30 In a double-blind study the effect of 400 mg of oral curcumin given thrice a day for 6 days to patients with postoperative inflammation(hernia or hydrocele) was studied along with oral antibiotic\u2014ampicillin.Phenylbutazone 100 mg given thrice a day served as the reference drug. Parameters evaluated were spermatic cord edema and tender- ness, postoperative pain, and tenderness, which were added to arrive ata total intensity scale. Curcumin was found to significantly reduce thetotal intensity score (2.38) as compared to placebo (1.0), which wascomparable to the effect seen with phenylbutazone (1.57). 44 Further clinical studies are needed to arrive at the utility of tur- meric and curcumin in different conditions; the safety of andcurcumin is deciduous tree found throughout the hotter parts of India and in the outer Himala- yas.45The official part of the plant is the fruit, and the fruit is a very powerful drug belonging to the group of toxic materials used inAntirheumatic Agents 171Ayurveda. Therefore, it is used only after processing to make it suit - able for consumption. After processing it is considered a rejuvenative (rasayana) with very powerful antiaging effects. The oil from the fruit and the juice from the bark of the tree have vesicant action saidto affect sensitive people even at a distance, so that people are oftenafraid even to approach the tree. 46The Sanskrit name bhallataka is derived from bhalla or spear. It is also one of the most heat-generat - ing herbs used in Ayurveda, and therefore called agni oranalla, in Sanskrit, which denotes fire. Because of this heat-producing prop - erty, there are restrictions for its use in hot weather: by pregnantwomen, the elderly, and the very young. Its use is also contraindi-cated in people of a pitta constitution, that is, those people who al - ready have a lot of \"heat\" in their body. In addition, the drug is oftenadministered with milk, clarified butter, or with butter products thatare considered to mitigate the heating effects of the drug. Thus it is adrug that is to be taken only under supervision of a competent doctor using carefully processed, detoxified material. 47The English name \"marking nut\" refers to the use of the black vesicant oil present in the fruit for marking clothes by washermen.45When used appropriately bhallataka helps in a number of disease conditions, including diges- tive disorders, piles, rheumatism, and cancer. The fruits contain anacardic acid, aromatic amines, and about 32 per- cent of vesicant oil\u2014the major constituent of which was termed bhil-wanol and later shown to be a mixture of phenolic compounds consist-ing of more than seven carboxylic acids. Also present are numerousbiflavonoids\u2014including tetrahydroamentoflavone, tetrahydrorobusta - flavone, and galluflavanone\u2014and nut-milk extract49,50and the chlo - extract51,52have shown that they exhibit anti-inflammatory ac - tivity in a number of experimental models of inflammation. Inadjuvant-induced arthritis in albino rats the milk extract was effectiveat a dose level of 150 mg\u00b7kg /H110021.50The drug may be acting by reducing lipid peroxidation,53its potent antioxidant activity,54by stabilizing disrupted lysosomal ezymes,55and at the same time normalizing car - bohydrate metabolism, which is affected during adjuvant arthritis.56 In addition, aqueous extract of Semecarpus anacardium shows mod - erate analgesic effect.57172 AYURVEDIC HERBSRheumatoid arthritis In a trial with 140 rheumatoid arthritis patients, 20 patients on pla - cebo were kept as control, whereas 120 patients were given the milk decoction of Semecarpus anacardium nuts for 27 days. Patients were evaluated on the basis of clinical and functional improvement andESR levels. In addition, gastrointestinal function was evaluated onthe basis of D-xylose absorption tests. Sixty-five percent of patientsexperienced very good relief in symptoms and improvement in walk - ing time, pressing power, grip power, etc. Improvement was also seenin ESR, hemoglobin Hb, and D-xylose. More side effects were ob- served in female patients than in male patients. 58In another open trial carried out on patients with rheumatoid arthritis (amavata) , who were on Semecarpus anacardium pills, or bhallatakavati (vati: pills in Sanskrit), the improvement was assessed as being \"spectacular.\"59 Whole bhallataka nuts (endocarp and pericarp) prepared with con- densed milk solids (khoya) and sugar were given twice a day in 5-10 g doses (10 g equivalent to 1 nut) to 25 patients with rheumatoid arthri- tis. Forty percent of patients showed complete remission, while 40percent showed major improvement, and 20 percent were assessed asshowing minor improvement based on the criteria enumerated by theAmerican Rheumatic Association. Improvement was seen in bodyache, general malaise, and debility; improvement in appetite, foodconsumption, and in hemoglobin values; in ESR values in variousfunctional tests like walking time, dressing time, articular strength,grip power, etc. 60 In another trial, the effect of Semecarpus anacardium nut-milk ex- tract was evaluated on the basis of its effect on lysosomal enzymes,which are elevated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Treatmentshowed a decrease in the lysosomal enzymes leading the authors toconclude that the milk extract was a promising drug for rheumatoidarthritis. No side effects were observed and the drug was well toler - ated. One patient had urticaria, which disappeared on reduction of thedose from 5 g to 2.5 g. 61 In a placebo-controlled study, 40 patients were enrolled in the trial: 30 in the drug group and 10 in the placebo group. The drug consistedof 3-5 g of amrit bhallataka twice daily with withAntirheumatic Agents 173500 mg of Boswellia serrata (sallaki) gum in capsules taken thrice daily for 10 weeks. It was found that 60 percent of patients receiving the drug showed very good change in laboratory findings and in clini - cal improvement, with eight patients showing normal improvementand four patients showing no improvement. Unfortunately, no otherdetails are available since the trial was reported as an abstract. 62 A three-drug under Commiphora mukul earlier in this chapter. This combination has been shown to be better than the indi - vidual herbs for rheumatoid arthritis, sciatica, frozen shoulder, andosteoarthritis. Sciatica In an open trial, 42 patients with sciatica (gridhrasi) were given Naimittika rasayana containing purified bhallataka in dosages of 100 mg to 1,000 mg twice a day. The Naimittika rasayana regimen consists of increasing the dosage every day by 100 mg starting from 100 mg and going up to 1,000 mg after which it is again reduced to100 mg for 2-12 weeks with milk and ghee. Twenty-five patientswere completely relieved of their complaints, although 12 patientsexperienced partial relief. Also observed was an overall improvementin their physical condition. Side effects were observed in five patientswhen the dosage was increased to more than 500 mg. 63 In a dose-searching study conducted with purified Semecarpus anacardium (bhallataka), good results were obtained at the 4 g\u00b7day/H110021 dosage, which was judged to be the optimum dosage for treatment ofsciatica. 64 As mentioned earlier in the opening paragraph, the drug is toxic before processing, but after suitable treatment it is considered non - toxic. There is an irritant oil in the pulp of the fruit that needs to be re - moved or modified.46Thus, a chloroform extract of the nuts of Semecarpus anacardium was toxic at all dose levels tested (50-400 mg\u00b7day/H110021).65However, a milk extract of the nuts did not show any acute toxicity (72 hours) at the levels tested (75-2,000 mg\u00b7day/H110021). In the subacute toxicity (30 days) no marked alteration was observed inblood biochemical values at 500 mg\u00b7day/H110021there was increase in blood glucose, se - rum creatinine, uric acid, and blood urea. In addition, changes in lipid profile were observed owing to the fact that clarified butter (ghee) isused as the base. Vital organs showed normal architecture. 66The clin - ical toxicity of the nuts studied in 266 patients showed no toxicity orside effects. 67In a trial on the role of Semecarpus anacardium on the management of rheumatoid arthritis, side effects such as urticarialrashes, mucosal irritation, and bleeding were seen. The patients inthis trial were carefully monitored and the drug withdrawn, ifneeded. 58In another trial, the drug prepared by boiling first in water then adding the solidified milk known as khoya, prepared by boiling off the water, was well tolerated, with only one patient developing ur-ticaria, which disappeared at half dose and the drug was welltolerated. 60 Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) (Family: Menispermaceae) Tinospora cordifolia (see Plate 4 in color gallery) is a climber found throughout India growing on trees and shrubs. The stem andthe aerial roots are generally used fresh. Other aspects of the plant arecovered in Chapter 4, \"Hepatoprotective agents\" where the herb isfirst described. It is one of ten plants commonly used in preparationsfor the treatment of joint diseases. 68,69The stem is an official drug in theIndian Herbal Pharmacopoeia, 2002, as an analgesic and an antipyretic agent.70 Experimental studies on small animals have demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effects of the aqueous extract of Tinospora cordi - folia in acute and chronic inflammation.71-74In experimental adju - vant-induced arthritis it inhibited both phase I and II.73The aqueous extract at 1 g\u00b7kg/H110021showed maximum anti-inflammatory effect in cot - ton pellet granuloma and formalin-induced arthritis.74,75 In an open trial, 50 patients with various joints problems diag - nosed according to Ayurveda as amavata (usually equated as rheu - matoid arthritis in modern parlance) and sandhigatavata (usually equated as osteoarthritis in modern parlance), degenerative arthritis,senile arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis were treated with capsules con - taining 480 mg of a dried aqueous extract of Tinospora cordifolia.Antirheumatic Agents 175The results were assessed in 24 patients as showing complete relief, 16 with partial relief, and 10 patients with no relief at all. Good im - provement was seen within 10 days of starting the treatment in 72percent of cases with the drug being well tolerated. In addition, manypatients obtained relief from constipation. 69 Other trials with Tinospora cordifolia on patients with rheumatoid arthritis have been reported either as a single drug76or in combination with ginger,77which is covered under the section on ginger. The safety of Tinospora cordifolia is covered negundo is a large aromatic shrub commonly found growing in many parts of India.78The Sanskrit name nirgundi implies that it works against a number of ailments ( nir:no;gunda/gundi: notorious). There are two varieties available in India that differ in the color of the stems\u2014white (Vitex negundo var.negundo), because it is covered with white hair, and purple (Vitex negundo var.purpurescens); however, it is not clear from published literature which variety has been used in stud-ies. Although all parts of the plant are used, the leaf and root are com - monly used in medicine; however, the leaf is used widely. The leaves are used both internally and externally to treat joints swellings andpains, rheumatism, fever, cough, and sinus problems. 79 The leaves contain approximately 0.04-0.07 percent of an essential oil containing several terpenes (with /H9252-caryophyllene as the leaf and leaf extracts (petroleum ether, methanol, aqueous methanol, and water) also showed significant analgesic activity.82-86176 AYURVEDIC HERBSThe leaves have been shown to have anti-inflammatory activity in a number of experimental models.83,86-88The leaves have also been shown to have antiarthritic activity in rats.89 The anti-inflammatory effect of Vitex negundo leaves is consid - ered to be mediated through histamine and 5-hydroxytrytamine (5- HT) both in the initial phase and in the delayed phase.90In addition, it has been suggested that the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effectsmay be due to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, 83,86membrane stabilizing, and antioxidant activity.86 In an open trial, 50 cases with rheumatoid arthritis were treated with Vitex negundo and found to show encouraging results.91In an - other open trial on 30 patients with deranged \" vata\" described as \"vatavyadhis \" (problems with motion), which could be loosely con- sidered to be rheumatism, 10 patients had rheumatoid arthritis(amavata) , whereas 10 patients had osteoarthritis (sandhigatavata) and were treated with 1 g Vitex negundo leaf powder taken orally twice a day, while an oil extract of the leaves\u2014prepared by boiling adecoction of the leaves in sesame oil till the water evaporated\u2014wasused to massage the affected areas. Five patients in each group with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis received Commiphora mukul orally and served as control. Patients had the disease for periods rang- ing from 1 to 10 years. Of the ten patients on Vitex with rheumatoid arthritis, four patients showed improvement ranging from 25 to 50percent based on clinical parameters, lowering of leukocytosis andimprovement in ESR values after 3 months, whereas no improvementwas seen in the remaining six cases even after 6 months, and the med - ication was changed to Commiphora mukul. In the control group all the five patients showed improvement, two cases recovering fully,one with 75 percent improvement, another with 50 percent, and theremaining patient dropping out due to loose motions as a result ofguggul treatment. In the group with sandigata vata (osteoarthritis) all the ten patients using Vitex showed improvement based on lessening of pain, decrease in swelling, and clinical improvement. No side ef - fects were observed. In two cases that were followed using X-ray,there was no radiological improvement. In the gugggul group improvement was not as good as the trial group. 92Thus Vitex neg - undo was found more effective in such asAntirheumatic Agents 177osteoarthritis (sandhigata vata), whereas worked better in patients arthritis (amavata) .I na d - dition, Vitex negundo was considered useful in cases where Commiphora mukul caused gastric irritation and diarrhea.92 However, the numbers in both arms are small and the patient popu - lation appears to have been nonhomogenous. Further trials are war - ranted with larger patient numbers and standardized plant material considering the promising nature of the results. Sciatica In a trial of 20 patients with sciatica, 10 patients were treated with sodhana, which includes certain Ayurvedic \"purificatory\" procedures for detoxification and samana (drug treatment), and 10 patients were treated with Vitex negundo andCommiphora mukul (samana alone). In group I, 60 percent of patients had complete relief and 40 percent had marked relief; however, in group II, 40 percent had complete relief,40 percent had marked relief, and 20 percent had mild relief. 93 The combination of guggul andVitex negundo has been tried out both in ankylosing spondylitis and in cervical spondylosis; seeCommiphora mukul earlier in this chapter. Another combination rasonadi using garlic, ginger, and nirgundi (Vitex negundo) in rheumatoid arthritis has been tried out. 94Fifty patients were included in the trial based on the American Rheumatic Association 1959guidelines. A decoction made from equal parts of dried ginger, garlic,andVitex negundo was given daily at a dose of 25 ml thrice daily for 6 weeks. The daily dosage corresponded to 25 g each of the three in - gredients. Initially, acute pain was controlled both by oral Ayurvedic medication and external application as required. Results were as - sessed based on pain relief, diminishing of swelling and tenderness, and increase in freedom of movement of joints, functional tests, andESR. There was significant relief in swelling and pain in the joints in2-3 weeks. Improvement in functional tests and ESR was also seen.Most patients were assessed as having \"complete relief\" or \"partial re - lief.\" Patients having the disease for a shorter time had greater relief. 94 The leaves are well tolerated in clinical dosages.95In an experi - mental study using fresh mature leaves of Vitex negundo, no acute toxicity or stress was found somnifera is an erect shrub found growing wild through - out the hotter parts of India and cultivated for its roots, which are well known in Ayurveda for their rejuvenative or rasayana properties. The roots are considered to have the smell of a horse, as the Sanskrit nameashwagandha denotes (ashwa: horse; gandha: smell), and are said to confer upon the person consuming them the strength and vitality of ahorse. The roots are thus used in debility and convalescence\u2014bysportspeople to increase endurance; in cough and sore throat; for re-ducing glandular swellings; as a sedative\u2014for insomnia; and in rheu-matism and gout. 96Ashwagandha is commonly referred to as \"Indian Ginseng\" because of its beneficial properties. The root has an officialstatus as an adaptogen in the Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia, 2002. 97 The roots contain 0.2-0.3 percent of alkaloids and withaferin A lactonesof ergostane type. 97,98In addition, the roots contain starch, reduc- ing sugars, hentriacontane, and a number of amino acids.98Also pres- ent are sitoindosides VII and VIII, which are sitoindosides IX and X, which are C-27 glycowithanolides thatmay contribute to the ofwithaferin A and sitoindosides VII-X 102\u2014were shown to possess an - tioxidant activity, which may explain the antistress, anti-inflamma - tory, immunomodulatory, and cognition-enhancing and rejuvenativeeffects shown in experimental and clinical studies. Withaferin A hasbeen shown to have anti-inflammatory and antiarthritic property inseveral experimental models. 103 The roots of Withania somnifera have been shown to possess anti- inflammatory activity in acute, subacute, and chronic models of in - flammation. In experimental animals, the powdered root showedAntirheumatic Agents 179considerable anti-inflammatory activity, although less than phenyl butazone at 1 g\u00b7kg/H110021body weight, while showing greater effect on acute phase reactants,104which are released into the blood during the acute phase of inflammation. NSAIDS have only a poor controlof acute phase reactants in contrast to steroidal anti-inflammatorydrugs. Ashwagandha in doses of 100 mg\u00b7100g /H110021body weight of rat showed a 32 percent reduction of paw volume as against 46 percentshown by phenyl butazone. In addition, ashwagandha influences most of the acute phase reactants in a very short time. 104It has, espe - cially, a good lowering effect on alpha-2 macroglobulin, an acutephase reactant, which is considered a sensitive index of the efficacyof anti-inflammatory drugs. 105At a dose of 1 anti-inflammatory effect in cotton pellet granuloma in rats.106 When tested for its long-term effect on adjuvant-induced arthritis inrats, it was found to exert a beneficial effect on swelling, and also pre-vented weight loss and degenerative changes seen in the bones inlong-standing arthritis. 107 In carrageenin-induced paw edema,108the aqueous extract of blocking histamine H1and H2,and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors in the early phase and prostaglandinsynthesis in the delayed phase of inflammation. However, in cotton pel-let granuloma, the anti-inflammatory activity of Withania somnifera is mediated by blocking the H 2receptors.106 In an open, exploratory trial with 63 patients with various arthropathies, 46 patients with rheumatoid arthritis were given 4, 6,o r9go fWithania somnifera root powder orally for a period of 3-4 weeks. It was found that pain and swelling disappeared in 12 pa-tients; there was considerable improvement in 10; mild improvementin 11; 4 patients had no relief; and there were 7 dropouts. 109 In another open trial, 77 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (amavata) w e r et r e a t e dw i t h3go fWithania somnifera root powder thrice a day with milk for 6 weeks. The results were evaluated as \"good\" in 22 per - cent, \"fair\" in 53 percent, \"poor\" in 22 percent, whereas 3 percent did notrespond. It was observed that patients who had the disease for less than ayear responded better to the treatment. 110 In a comparative randomized trial using three different treatment op - tions, 120 patients with rheumatoid arthritis were Panchakarma treatment consisting of various treat - ment modalities (such as vomiting, two forms of enema or bloodletting and enema, purgation, and nasal application of medicine) for detoxifica - tion. All three arms gave highly significant results ( p< 0.001); however, maximum improvement was seen in the Panchakarma group.111 In a preliminary open trial, 25 patients with radiologically con - firmed cervical spondylosis were administered 4 g of Withania somnifera powder along with 100 ml of decoction from Smilax china given thrice a day for 30 days. The results were compared withbrufen\u2014an allopathic NSAID. 112 In clinical trials for arthritis, using up to 6 g of Withania somnifera root powder for 3-4 weeks was well tolerated.109In a long-term trial on healthy volunteers in the age group of 50-59 years to study itstonic antiaging effect, 3 g of the root powder in three divided dosesfor 1 year showed no untoward side effects, and there was an increasein hemoglobin levels in the subjects. 113Acute toxicity and a 4-week subacute study with aqueous extract of Withania somnifera in doses from 50 mg to 1 g\u00b7kg/H110021showed no toxic effects. There was no hepatic or renal toxicity.114Also chronic feeding of Ashwagandha at 100 mg\u00b7kg/H110021for 180 days did not show any toxicity or significant changes in the biochemical profile of blood;115the safety data Roscoe (Family: Zingiberaceae) Ginger is a widely used traditional medicine for a variety of ailments, including its use for specific action in rheumatism and in - flammation. Other aspects of the rhizome and its pungent principleshave been covered in greater detail in Chapter 3, \"Gastrointestinalagents,\" where it first appears in this book. According to Ayurveda,impaired digestion is a major cause of all diseases, and ginger is con - sidered to act on all the three phases of digestion\u2014digestion, absorp - tion, and elimination, and therefore help in ameliorating variousproblems. In Chapter 3, the use of ginger in relieving malabsorp - tion\u2014a contributory factor in the causation of inflammatory disor - ders, such as rheumatoid arthritis\u2014has been described. Ginger is anAntirheumatic Agents 181official drug in the Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia, 2002, for its car - minative, antiemetic, and anti-inflammatory properties.117 Ginger exhibits an anti-inflammatory induced paw edema118-121and in cotton pellet-induced granuloma in rats.120Ginger oil has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity inhibiting chronic adjuvant arthritis in rats.122More specifi - cally, the gingerols and shoagols are among the active constituents of ginger.1236-Gingerol and four other compounds, namely, [6]- and [10]-dehydrogingerdione, and [6]- and [10]-gingerdiones, were foundto be potent inhibitors of prostaglandin biosynthesis. 124Ginger and its various pungent constituents behave as dual inhibitors of the arachi-donic acid pathway, inhibiting both cyclooxgenase 125,126and lipoxy- genase.125,127,128Of special intothrombocytes. [6]- Gingerol has also been shown to be a potent inhib-itor of NO-synthesis, and is effective in protecting against peroxy-nitrite-induced damage. 131 One of the first studies using ginger was reported in 1977.132In an open study, seven patients with rheumatic disorders given gingerfound relief in pain and associated symptoms. 133In a larger group of 56 patients, 28 with rheumatoid arthritis, 18 with osteoarthritis, and10 with muscular discomfort, were treated with powdered ginger. Ofthese, 75 percent of arthritis patients found relief in pain and swell-ing. All patients with muscular discomfort had relief from pain. Noside effects were reported during ginger administration in periodsranging from 3 months to 2.5 years. 134 A number of combinations of ginger with other drugs have been re - ported to study the effect of gastrointestinal stimulant drugs for thetreatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, four groups with three combi - nation drugs were tried out. In group 1, ginger was combined withTinospora cordifolia, in group 2 and in group 4 ginger was combined with Commiphora mukul, whereas in group 3 a decoction of the three plants of ginger, Vitex negundo, andrasna (Botanical name not men - tioned) was tried out. In order to estimate the comparative efficacy ofthe drugs they were compared against standard Ayurvedic drugs thatare traditional multiplant preparations selected on the basis of the 1959 criteria of the American Rheumatic Association. In the first trial, 77 patients were enrolled and given 25-50 ml of a de - and Tinospora Vatagajankusa rasa, andMaharasanadi kwatha. There was slow improvement in the major presenting features (pain, swelling, and restriction in movement). The results from the sunthi-guduchi group were assessed to be better because more patients experienced partial re - lief, fewer patients had no relief, and there were fewer dropouts. TheESR showed significant decrease in the sunthi-guduchi group coming within normal limits at the end of the treatment period. 135,136 The second combination of ginger with Commiphora mukul (guggul) was tried out first in an open comparative format with 63 pa- tients, of which 36 patients receive d2go f sunthi-guggul (1 g each of powdered rhizome of purified resin of Commi- phora mukul ) thrice a day for 6 weeks, whereas the second group re- ceived the traditional combination of 1 g Yogaraja guggulu, 0.5 g Amavatari Rasa, a Kwatha thrice a day. Inclu- sion parameters were evolved based on the 1959 criteria of the Ameri-can Rheumatic Association. These were morning stiffness, pain whilepassing motion, tenderness, swelling in one or more joints, and sym-metrical joint involvement. Apart from clinical assessment, ESR levelswere also monitored. The improvement in the sunthi-guggulu group was assessed as being \"remarkable\" and the number of patients obtain - ing complete relief and partial relief was more than the patients in thestandard treatment group. However, the majority of patients had thedisease for less than 1 year. 135,137 Based on the good results obtained with the combination of sunthi - guggulu, another trial with 75 patients was carried out for 6 weeks with the drug along with external treatment. All patients who completed thetrial showed definite improvement although the number of patients whoobtained complete relief was small; partial relief was obtained by morethan 50 percent of patients. It was observed that male patients and thosewith a shorter duration of the disease showed better results. 137,138Antirheumatic Agents 183The third group of 50 patients was treated for 6 weeks with 25 ml de - coction of the combination containing rasna (Botanical name not men tioned), n dnirgundi (Vitex negundo) taken thrice daily. Complete relief was experienced by 28 percent of the pa - tients, whereas 46 percent had partial relief. It was observed that female patients had better relief; however, the patient number is perhaps toosmall to make definite conclusions and this observation needs to beconfirmed. 135The drug rasna has not been botanically identified in the paper by the Latin name, which is unfortunate considering the fact thatrasna is one of the so-called controversial drugs of Ayurveda where the identity of the plant is disputed and more than one plant is considered tobe the genuine source of the drug. In a recent, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi- centric, parallel group study, the efficacy and safety of Zingiber officinale with Alpinia galanga was evaluated in 261 patients with moderate-to-severe knee pain because of osteoarthritis. The drug wasa standardized and highly concentrated extract containing the twospecies. The primary efficacy criterion was a reduction in knee painon standing. There was statistically significant reduction in symp-toms of osteoarthritis of the knee (63 percent responders in the gingergroup versus 50 percent in the placebo group). Patients receiving theginger extract experienced more gastrointestinal side effects than theplacebo group (59 versus 21). 139 The safety of ginger is covered in Chapter 3, \"Gastrointestinal agents.\" In a trial using ginger in 56 patients for periods ranging from3 months to 2.5 years no side effects were experienced. 134 Further clinical trials are needed to establish the efficacy in larger patient numbers, especially for the two combination preparations ofginger with Tinospora cordifolia and with Commiphora mukul, which appear offer advantages over monotherapy.

InAyurveda, plants have been the mainstay of treatment and the man-agement of skin diseases, or kustha. In the field of traumatic injuries (methods of treatment and care of injury), there are experts who spe-cialize in the setting of bones and the treatment of the injury. The he-reditary bonesetters of Puthur, a small village in Andhra Pradesh, arewell known for their bonesetting skills. Herbs are applied externallyon the injured site, and are also given internally to help healing andstrengthening of the bone. People come from far and wide to get theirinjuries treated. A large number of plants have been found to be used in the treat- ment of skin disorders. 1However, relatively few of them have been subjected to clinical trials although or perhaps because, they formpart of the day-to-day practice of Ayurvedic physicians. Plants andplant products are frequently used in homes to preserve healthy skin.Common among these are turmeric and sandalwood. Others includeneem leaves, the astringent barks of different Ficus species, and members of the Labiateae such as holy basil, Leucas aspera, etc. This chapter is divided into three sections\u2014the first section is on skin diseases and includes the different categories given by Willuhn.It covers diseases caused by external Inc.

NOTES 1. V ohora SB, Mishra GV . Rational basis of the use of medicinal plants in skin diseases. Indian Drugs 35:1-17 (1998). SKIN DISEASES Since most of the trials are of a preliminary and exploratory nature covering several indications, it is not possible to group them into dif-ferent categories and they are covered according to the plant. Amongvarious skin problems, eczema, scabies, and ringworm are com-monly found in India. In addition, numerous skin disorders caused byfungi, bacteria, virus, or due to allergy also abound. the neem tree is considered to be a veritable pharmacy, all parts being used for a wide variety of ailments, espe - cially for the treatment of skin disorders of varied etiology. Just sleeping under a neem tree is said to promote one's health. Whereas all parts of the tree are used medicinally, the leaves and seed oil areused most widely for the treatment of skin diseases. The fresh greenleaves have long been used as a household remedy to relieve itch insmallpox, chicken pox, and measles. It is also customary to apply a194 AYURVEDIC HERBSfreshly ground paste of turmeric and neem leaves on the body while taking the first bath after recovering from measles, chicken pox, and small pox. Other aspects of neem, its chemistry, and use in diabetesare covered in Chapter 11, \"Antidiabetic agents.\" There is evidence to show that neem is active against a wide range of bacteria, fungi, and viruses. The aqueous and alcoholic extract ofthe leaf and bark, 1the chloroform extract of leaves, the seed oil, and the gum showed antibacterial activity against a variety of pathogens.2-5 The oil obtained by steam distillation of fresh mature leaves showedantifungal activity against Trichophyton mentagrophytes 6in vitro; stem bark extract7and seeds had antimycotic activity against Candida albicans.8Neem leaf extract has also shown antiviral activity against several viruses. Water extract of tenderleaves showed antiviral activity against vaccinia 9,10and variola9vi- ruses. In addition, neem leaf extract shows activity against fowl pox virus, chikungunya, and measles viruses, group B coxsackievirusesand dengue virus type-2. 10-13 It has been suggested that the range of diseases on which neem has a favorable effect is owing to the immunomodulatory effect shown byseveral parts of the tree. 14,15Thus the bark,14,15leaf,15,16and seed oil17 have been shown to have an immunomodulatory effect. The leafaqueous extract modulates both addition, neem exerts an anti-inflammatory effect. Thus, the alcoholic extract of leaves18and the water-soluble portion of the alcoholic extract,19but not the ether soluble fraction,20 show anti-inflammatory effect. However, the ether-soluble fractionhas a potent analgesic effect under acute inflammatory conditions. 20 Eczema, ringworm, scabies Eczema is an inflammation of the skin that is accompanied by itch - ing, scaling, or blisters. Ringworm (tinea) is a fungal infection of theskin, hair, and nails; whereas, scabies is caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabei that causes itching. In an open study, patients with common skin disorders such as ec - zema, ringworm, and scabies were treated with a lotion prepared bydissolving the residue of a 70-percent alcoholic extract of neemleaves in propylene glycol in the ratio of 2:3 and applying it on theSkin and Trauma Care Agents 195affected part. The lotion was applied twice a day for 3 days to treat scabies, and 4-8 days to treat cases of ringworm. The lotion wasfound to be effective in all cases of acute weeping and chronic eczema,ringworm, and scabies. 21,22Many of these patients were nonresponding to conventional treatments, such as salicylic acid, benzoyl benzoate,and sulfur. In an open trial, the oil obtained by boiling Strychnos nux vomica nut in neem oil was applied externally on patients with eczema andwas found to yield good results. 23In patients with scabies, a 4:1 mix - ture of fresh neem leaves and turmeric powder was applied on 814patients with scabies. More than 97 percent of the patients were curedwithin 3-15 days by this treatment. 24No toxic or adverse effects were seen. In a report, the use of one to two 500 mg neem capsules madefrom leaves, flowers, and twig powder, taken orally with food twice aday for long periods, \"dramatically\" helped patients with chronicfungal infections of skin and nails, boils, and other bacterial infec-tions. It was also reported to be useful in cases of allergic skin condi-tions and psoriasis. 25Other neem products that have been reported to be useful in psoriasis are the bitter compound nimbidin26and neem toddy27taken together with a compound herbomineral preparation Arogyavardini vati, which is used in a number of conditions\u2014skin problems, obesity, hepatitis, chronic constipation, anorexia, heart pro-blems, and many others. Studies involving the use of neem prepara-tions in wound healing are discussed later in this chapter. It would thus be worthwhile to explore the nature of the products required and conduct further trials to establish the efficacy parame - ters to confirm the success that has been reported with a variety of neem preparations. Preparations derived from the neem tree, such as from the bark and the leaf, generally have a wide margin of safety except for the seed oil for which some data exists that it may be unsafe, especially in oralconsumption by infants in doses of 5-30 ml, 28which is in any case a high dosage for any oil to be given to infants. One study has shownthat the seed oil is safe for topical use in wounds; 29however, care needs to taken in assessing the quality of the starting material, themethod of processing, and the composition of oil halicacabum is a slender climber found growing throughout India up to 1,200 m elevation. The tender shoots are used as a vegetable, whereas the whole plant is used for medicinal pur - poses. The plants belong to the group of ten auspicious herbs ordasapushpa (dasa: ten; pushpa: flowers), which are supposed to pro- mote health and remove unhealthy tendencies, including the urge to commit sinful acts. 30The drug appears in later Ayurvedic texts. The herb is used for rheumatism, nervous disorders, sprains, lumbago, edema, and earache. The leaves are used for wound healing, in piles,for treatment of asthma, and to relieve fever associated withcough. 30,31The herb is very commonly used in food in Tamil Nadu to get relief from rheumatic complaints, probably because of its use inSiddha medicine. It is also used in skin disorders to treat eczema andherpes. 32 There are two varieties of Cardiospermum halicacabum with differences in the size and shape of the fruit, and in the size and shapeof the leaves; the fruits of Cardiospermum halicacabum var. micro- carpum have smaller, winged and smaller leaves, whereas Cardiospermum halicacabum var.luridum has larger bloated three-lobed fruits, which are not winged, and larger leaves. 33 It is not certain which of these varieties has been used in the variousinvestigations, and the impact of this on the results obtained; both va - rieties are probably similar in activity and used interchangeably;however, this needs to be verified. The results are cited as inliterature. It is likely that the investigations from India used the morewidespread var. microcarpum; there is also the fact that Cardio - spermum halicacabum var.luridum was earlier identified as Cardio - spermum canescens in India. Investigations from Germany probably used the var. luridum from the picture of the plant published along with the review article summarizing German investigations. 34Skin and Trauma Care Agents 197A large number of constituents have been isolated from the several - mental pouch,35cotton of a 95-percent ethanolic extract has alsobeen studied in mice and the heptane fraction of this extract at 232 \u00b5g per ear was found to exhibit potent activity, probably through inhibi - tion of the enzyme phospholipase A2. 38 Studies conducted using an alcoholic extract of the fresh flowering plant of Cardiospermum halicacabum in the form of a cream has been included here since it is used in the form of a homeopathicmother tincture, and hence is comparable to that used in herbal medicine. Neurodermatitis, atopic dermatitis, and eczema Neurodermatitis is an itchy, eczema-like skin condition caused by repeated scratching, whereas atopic dermatitis is inflammation of the skin caused by allergy. In an open observational study, 512 patientswith neurodermatitis were treated with Cardiospermum cream; 42 patients served as control and used both the base cream without theactive drug and the Cardiospermum cream. It was found that there was reduction in the erythema when using the active cream as judgedby reduction in redness. In addition, patients could reduce their othermedications\u2014 corticosteroids and antihistamines. 39In another open observational study, similar results were obtained from patients witheczema. 40In another controlled double-blind study in patients with atopic dermatitis, the superior efficacy of the Cardiospermum cream against the base cream41and of comparable efficacy to bufexamac has been observed.42These results have led to the cream being allowed to be used in Germany in 1995 for inflammatory skin disorders accom - panied by itching, such as HERBSAerial parts of Cardiospermum halicacabum var.microcarpum are sold as fresh herbs in the market in Chennai (earlier Madras) es - pecially after the rains. The leaves are often eaten both raw and cooked as food in Chennai to relieve joint pain. The LD50of the alco - holic extract when injected intraperitoneally in mice is 20 mg\u00b725 g/H110021 body weight.35In the open study, the tolerability of the Cardio - spermum cream was evaluated as good to very good by 82 percent of the patients.39TheCardiospermum halicacabum ointment was well tolerated, and in efficacy distinctly superior to the ointment base in adouble-blind study. 41The tolerability of the bases used for the oint - ment and the tincture of Cardiospermum halicacabum did not show any irritation or is a medium-sized tree with shiny leaves found almost throughout India up to an elevation of 1,200 m. All plant parts are used medicinally and the plant is a reputed drug for skin prob-lems. The leaves, seed, and bark are considered to be useful in skinproblems because of their anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antisep - tic properties. 43The seed paste and seed oil especially are highly re - garded for the treatment of scabies, herpes, leukoderma, and otherskin diseases. 44 The tree has been extensively investigated for its chemical constitu - ents and a large number of different classes of compounds kanjone, and pongaglabrone, the diketone\u2014pongamol. The oil has been clinically shown to be nonirritating.Karanjin, one of the major flavones of the seeds, is said to be theSkin and Trauma Care Agents 199active principle, which is responsible for the curative effect of the oil in skin diseases.44 The few studies carried out so far support the use of Pongamia pinnata in skin problems. Thus Pongamia pinnata seed extracts at 50 mg\u00b7kg/H110021to 100 mg\u00b7kg/H110021given intraperitoneally showed anti- inflammatory, analgesic, and antiulcerogenic effect in rats.45,46It has been suggested that the anti-inflammatory effect may be owing to themodulation of eicosanoid formation in inflammation. 45In addition, the seed oil has been shown to possess antibacterial activity against14 strains of pathogenic bacteria mainly because of inhibition of cellmembrane synthesis in the bacteria. 47In vitro experiments have shown that the aqueous seed extract inhibits growth of the herpes -virus\u2014HSV-1 mg\u00b7ml /H110021and HSV-2 at 20 mg\u00b7ml/H110021\u2014in Vero cells.48 The only clinical evidence comes from a study that has been pub- lished as an abstract.49Thus, in an open, exploratory study, patients with a wide variety of skin complaints\u2014herpetic lesions due to Shin- gles zoster (infection of the nerves characterized by painful rash) and Herpes genitalis (painful blisters caused by the herpes simplex virus 2 producing soreness, itching, and painful blisters in the genital area),impetigo (blisters around the mouth due to skin infection caused bybacteria, especially Staphylococci ), ringworm, Pityriasis versicolor (a skin problem caused by fungus and characterized by white, brown,or colored flaking skin on the neck and trunk), and eczema weretreated with Pongamia seed oil, a 1:1 sterile aqueous extract of Pongamia seed, or Pongamia root. The control group received only paraffin oil for application. \"Remarkable\" healing effects were seenwith Pongamia seed oil for herpetic lesions due to Shingle zoster and Herpes genitalis, whereas the seed extract helped in treating Shingles zoster. Impetigo was helped by both the oil and seed extract, whereas oil, seed extract, and root extract were all active in the case of ring - worm. There is no mention of its effect on eczema and Pityriasis versicolor. Further clinical studies are warranted since the preliminary results are promising. Although a lot of work has been done on the chemicalconstituents of the seed oil, it would be useful to establish the compo - sition of the material being used for the trials. This would be impor - tant since it has been mentioned in earlier work, that seed 50and seed200 AYURVEDIC HERBSoil51are toxic. However, seeds were nontoxic after solvent extrac- tion51and the purified oil is safe for use.52Safety studies have been carried out on the seed aqueous extract.53 NOTES 1.

LEUKODERMA/FOLLICULAR ECZEMA Leukoderma is a skin condition caused by the inability of melanoblasts to synthesize melanin. White patches appear on the skin wherever melanin is lost. Many plants have been described forits treatment in Ayurveda. The incidence of the disease is estimated tobe 3 percent higher in India than the world incidence of 1 percent. 1 is an erect annual herb with bluish purple flowers found growing wild throughout India. The seeds are a re - puted drug for the skin in Ayurveda, especially for leprosy,leukoderma, and psoriasis, and also for inflammatory skin disorders,both in the form of topical application as well as oral administration. 2 The seeds have been extensively investigated for their chemical constituents. They contain 0.05 percent essential oil, 10 percent of abrown fixed oil, a nonvolatile oil containing terpenoids, approxi considered to be the active principles useful in leukoderma of nonsyphilitic origin.2Psoralen has been shown to stimulate melanin production by accumulation in the melanocytes and photooxidation of the dihydroxyphenylalaninepresent there to melanin. alcoholic7,8extracts of Psoralea corylifolia seeds have shown inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus. The petroleum ether extract of the seeds in - hibited the growth of Staphylococci at a concentration of 2-4 \u00b5g\u00b7ml/H110021, especially those of Staphylococcus aureus that are resistant to several antibiotics such as penicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol,erythromycin, and tetracycline. 9Later on, an oily compound was iso- lated that inhibited Staphylococcus aureus at 0.5 \u00b5g\u00b7ml/H110021with an ac- tivity comparable to that of chloramphenicol.10,11Bakuchiol has been studied for its anti-staphylococcal activity.12In addition, the seeds have also been shown to have immunomodulatory activity,13whereas bakuchiol and the flavonoids\u2014isobavachin and isobavachalcone\u2014have have potent antioxidant activity. 14The flavonoid, bavachinin, has been shown to exert marked anti-inflammatory,antipyretic, and mild analgesic activity. 15 Leukoderma The preliminary exploratory studies were carried out with differ- ent preparations, derived from the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia, ap- plied topically on the affected areas for a variety of skin disorders.From these exploratory studies it was found that the oleoresin of theseeds, which contained most of the essential oil, was most useful inleukoderma patches. 16 The oral clinical use of the powdered seeds of Psoralea corylifolia for the treatment of leukoderma is dose dependently at - tended by severe side effects such as nausea, vomiting headache,and severe purging, so that in all further clinical studies, a mixtureof psoralen and isopsoralen was used in doses of 10-30 mg\u00b7day /H110021for 4 months with good results. However, the drug can no longer beconsidered an herbal preparation; the results of such studies havebeen summarized. 3Skin and Trauma Care Agents 205Follicular eczema Follicular eczema is an infection of the hair follicle caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The seeds of Psoralea corylifolia, which have exhibited good antibacterial activity, may be of use in this con - dition, which is characterized by chronicity. In addition, antibiotics give only temporary relief. The alcoholic extract of the seeds wasdissolved in coconut oil and 5-30 ml of the oil was applied twice aday for periods ranging from 2 to 4 weeks in 21 patients. A total of17 out of the 21 patients had significant relief and when followed upfor 2 years there was no relapse. There were four dropouts after2 weeks. At the end of 2-4 weeks of treatment 12 patients had com - plete relief, 2 had marked relief, and 3 patients had moderate relief.Continuation of the treatment for a few more days resulted in all pa-tients obtaining complete relief. 17 Topical use of the seed oil can cause irritation, blistering, and also act as a vesicant. The oleoresin extract of the seeds had the officialstatus in the Indian Pharmacopoeia, 1960, as \"Babchi ointment\" or \"Application of Psoralea.\" The strength of the oil or its preparationhas to be adjusted to prevent redness beyond that already present inthe leukoderma patch. 2,18 It appears that the external application is useful in certain cases, but is attended by side effects such as irritation of the skin; therefore,until it is possible to standardize the product it is likely to be of useonly in the form of the pure compounds and derivatives and not as awhole drug.

PSORIASIS Psoriasis is a skin condition characterized by itching, scaling, and hyperproliferation of skin, and is estimated to be afflicting 1-3 per - cent of populations. Although a number of plants have been used in Ayurveda for the treatment of psoriasis, only a few of them have beenevaluated to some degree. The best known of these are vera, Azadirachta indicia, Centella 207case of Azadirachta indica, its bitter principle, nimbidin, has been used and is therefore not covered here since nimbidin cannot be considered an herbal drug. Aloe vera Tourn. ex Linn (Family: Liliaceae) In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the efficacy and tolerability of a 0.5 percent of Aloe vera cream was studied on 60 pa - tients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis. Patients had the disease for an average of 8.5 years before entry to the trial. Patients were given ei - therAloe vera cream or placebo and asked to apply the cream thrice a day for 5 consecutive days for a total of 4 weeks. The progress of pa-tients was evaluated every week. By the end of the trial, the Aloe vera extract cream had cured 25 out of 30 patients as compared to 2 out of30 in the placebo group, resulting in considerable clearing ofpsoriatic plaques. No side effects were observed. 1 Centella asiatica (Linn.) Urban (Family: Apiaceae) In a small clinical study, seven patients with psoriasis were treated with a cream containing an oil and water extract of Centella asiatica (see Plate 8 in color gallery) for periods ranging from 3 to 8 weeks. Itwas found that five out of seven patients showed complete clearanceof the lesions. None of the patients experienced any side effects. Oneof the patients, who had frequently been using steroids in the past,showed only partial recovery. 2Except for one patient, the remaining six patients were routinely asked to apply salicylic acid ointment 12hours after the application of Centella. In vitro studies have shown thatCentella asiatica extract has a keratinocyte antiproliferant activ - ity. 3Further studies are needed with deciduous tree found almost through - out India. The bark is sometimes used to adulterate the bark of Holarrhena antidysentrica, which is covered in Chapter 3, \"Gastro - intestinal agents,\" for the treatment of amebiasis. The leaves containindigotin, which yields 0.3-0.5 percent of the dye indigo, known asMysore Pala Indigo, used for dyeing fabric. 4The tree is useful medic - inally. The leaves are used in Ayurveda for toothache and hyperten - sion; the bark and seeds for dyspepsia, flatulence, leprosy, psoriasis,and fever. 5The leaves are especially useful in skin problems, and in Siddha medicine forms part of many combination drugs used for of psoriasis. Indigotin, indirubin, tryptanthrin, isatin, also contain /H9252-amyrin, lupeol, /H9252-sitosterol, and Coconut oil containing the leaf extract of Wrightia tinctoria showed significant analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity.8In in emulsion showed reversal of parake- ratosis, which is a feature of psoriasis.9 In an open running trial, 281 patients with psoriasis were treated between 1980 and 1987. The trial drug coded \"777\" oil was obtainedby exposing fresh leaves of Wrightia tinctoria in coconut oil to sun- light for 3 days, followed by filtering off the oil. Patients were given5 ml of the oil twice a day and patients were also asked to apply theoil over the affected regions and expose these areas to sunlight for 5-10 minutes. 10,11There were 67 dropouts. Of the remaining 214 pa - tients who completed the course of treatment, 108 patients had com - plete relief, 49 patients had marked relief, 39 had moderate relief, 17had mild relief, and 1 patient had no relief. Disappearance of scalingwas taken as mild relief. Disappearance of scales and eyrthematouschanges were considered as moderate relief, transformation of papu - lar to macular lesions as marked relief, whereas total disappearanceof all clinical symptoms was considered as complete relief. A total of30 patients were taken to undertake a detailed study for biopsy andalso followed up for 4 years. There was no recurrence in 50 percent ofthe cases, although in 30 percent recurrence was postponed to morethan 3 years. Recurrence was accompanied by great reduction in in -Skin and Trauma Care Agents 209tensity, and there was no occurrence of any of the complications such as arthritis and carona psoriatica.10 Nonspecific dermatitis In an open trial, 20 patients with histologically confirmed nonspe - cific dermatitis, who presented extensive skin lesions, burning, andintense itching, were treated with oil of Wrightia tinctoria taken orally twice a day, as well as the oil being applied topically, followedby short exposure to sunlight for a period of 6 weeks. Of these, 14 pa - tients showed complete relief and no relapse was observed for more than 3 years. 10 The acute toxicity (72 hours) of 777 oil prepared from Wrightia tinctoria leaves was studied in mice and rats and the LD50was found to be 45 ml\u00b7kg/H110021in mice and 30 ml\u00b7kg/H110021in rats. A 30-day subacute toxicity carried out at three dosage levels\u20141, 5, and 10 ml of the oil extract with controls\u2014was found to be nontoxic. Major organs suchas liver, kidney, spleen, heart, and lung showed no toxicity orhistopathological changes. 10 NOTES 1. Syed TA, Ahmad SA, Holt AH, Ahmad SA, Ahmad SH, Afzal M.

WOUND HEALING PLANTS Plants have served as healing agents for wounds since time imme- morial. The healing of wounds has been dealt with as separate topics in the major Ayurvedic texts of Sushruta, Jivika, and Vagbhata, be-cause of the importance attached to this topic as a matter of immedi-ate concern in those days owing to the living environment, and thefrequent battles and wars. The Sushruta Samhita has two separate chapters dealing with the treatment of the injuries and the handling ofpatients, describing the use of more than one hundred plants for thetreatment of wounds, both as single drugs and in combination. 1 Sushruta has mentioned not only procedures and drugs to obtain aclean wound (vrana shodan) followed by healing (vrana ropan) but also medicines to help prevent the formation of keloid scars. 2 Aloe barbadensis Mill. barabadensis is a perennial plant with succulent leaves originally introduced from Africa into India, now found in a semiwildSkin and Trauma Care Agents 211state in many parts of the country. The leaves are widely used in Ayurvedic medicine. Its usage varies corresponding to the part of theleaf being used\u2014the outer thick covering of the leaf, in which thesteamed leaf without pulp is applied to abscesses; the inner yellowjuice or exudate, which flows out from the leaf after cutting, darkensand solidifies after a while to a dark mass called aloes containinganthraquinones, is a drastic purgative; and the inner mucilaginousleaf pulp or gel, composed mainly of carbohydrates, is considered a tonic for the liver, in female complaints such as amenorrhea and dysmenorrhea, and during menopause, good for the eyes, and for thetreatment of burns, wounds, and skin diseases. 3,4 Aloe barbadensis gel contains about 98.5 percent of water with poly- saccharides as the major constituents\u2014pectins, hemicelluloses, gluco-mannan, acemannan, the major carbohydrate component and mannose derivatives where mannose-6-phosphate is the major sugar component. Also present are amino acids; lipids; sterols such as campesterol, lupeol,and/H9252-sitosterol; component,7have topical8,9and oral8wound healing activity of Aloe vera has been extensively studied. Studies on the healing of dermal woundsobserved that there were increased levels of collagen in the granulationtissue 10and improved synthesis of glycosaminoglycan component11of the extracellular matrix in a healing wound, thereby contributing to im-proved wound healing. Aloe vera also improved healing of full thick- ness wounds in diabetic rats, where both healing and anti-inflamma-tory processes are retarded because of diabetes. 12In addition, Aloe vera helped faster healing of burn wounds in guinea pigs by exhibit - ing an antibacterial effect,13and in rats by its anti-inflammatory and aiding the wound healing activity.14The inflammatory process was inhibited by reduction of leukocyte adhesion and of inflammation-causing cytokines. 15Aloe vera was also found to reverse retardation of wound healing caused by silver sulfadiazine16and steroids.17Other useful activities of Aloe vera gel, when applied externally, include a beneficial effect on skin regeneration18and its antioxidant activity.19 The antioxidant activity is dependent on the age of the plant\u20143-yearold plants showing greater antioxidant (BHT), /H9251-tocopherol\u20142- also higher levels of polysaccharides and flavonoids.19 Among the constituents contributing to the observed activity, two immunomodulatory compounds were isolated from the gel of Aloe vera.20Subsequently, acemannan has been shown to accelerate wound healing.21Mannose-6-phosphate, a major sugar in Aloe vera gel, improved wound healing in mice over saline controls.22A glyco - protein fraction has been shown to improve wound healing via cell proliferation and migration.6In addition, an active glycoprotein frac - tion has been shown to exhibit radical scavenging effect apart frominhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 and thromboxane A 2 potent immunostimulatory poly- saccharide present up to 0.015 percent of the dry weight of aloe juice, has been isolated.7Thus, many components of Aloe gel have been shown to play a useful role in wound healing. The therapeutic effects of Aloe vera were examined in a number of indications in dermal ischemia due to burns, frostbite, electrical in-jury, distal dying flap, and intra-arterial drug abuse. In burn patientsand those suffering from frostbite, patients healed without tissue loss.Tissue necrosis was reversed in intra-arterial drug-abuse patients.The results suggest that Aloe acts by inhibition of thromboxane A2 production and by maintenance of homeostasis both in the woundand also in the surrounding tissue. 24 In a placebo-controlled study involving 27 patients with partial thickness burns were treated with Aloe vera gel. Patients treated with Aloe vera gel showed faster recovery in 11.8 days as compared to those treated with petroleum jelly gauze (18.2 days), which was con - sidered statistically significant.25 In a randomized double-blind study, 100 patients with 10-40 per - cent burns had wounds dressed either with Aloe vera extract or rou - tine dressing done every 3 days. The main wound healing time wassignificantly lower (p < 0.001) in the case of those treated with Aloe vera as was bacteriological control ( p< 0.012). 26 There are a number of factors involved in the use of Aloe vera gel. The gel itself is preferably used fresh due to possible decomposition5 and also the probable negative effect on the clinical outcome of addedstabilizers 27and the further processing that the gel undergoes.28Ex-Skin and Trauma Care Agents 213perimental studies have shown that Aloe vera gel may delay wound healing in the later stages.29In first- and second-degree burns in mice, Aloe vera gel increased the rate of healing, improved epithelializa - tion, and reduced inflammation, but proved to be not very effective for third-degree burns.30As information becomes available on the contribution of the various components of the gel and the time of ap - plication to wound healing, it should be possible to obtain more con - sistent results, since negative trials have also been reported with Aloe gel. More clinical trials are required to further validate the use of Aloe vera gel. The topical use of the gel is generally considered safe. Cases of irritation may be attributed to the presence of traces of anthra-quinones. However, the possibility of allergic reactions needs to beborne in mind. 5 Centella asiatica (Linn.) Urban (Family: Apiaceae) The use of Centella asiatica (see Plate 8 in color gallery) in chronic venous insufficiency has been covered in Chapter 6, \"Cardio- vascular drugs,\" and its use as a mental rejuvenator in Chapter 12. Centella asiatica is well known in Ayurveda31,32as a local stimulant of the skin, and is used therefore in skin diseases, such as herpes, ec-zema, and psoriasis and in wound healing. Extracts of Centella asiatica have been evaluated in experimental animals. Thus both alcoholic 33and aqueous extract34ofCentella asiatica when applied to open wounds in rats showed an increased cell proliferation and protein synthesis. Treated wounds healed fasteras compared to untreated controls showing faster epithelialization and rate of wound contraction 33,34in experimental wounds. The ex - tract as well as the total triterpenes\u2014asiaticoside, asiatic acid, and madecassic acid reconstituted from the plant in the ratio 4:3:3 havebeen shown to increase the percentage of collagen in human skin fibroblast cultures 35and also to stimulate glycosaminoglycan synthe - sis in experimental wounds in rats.36These three triterpenes have been shown to hasten wound healing by increasing human collagen I synthesis.37In addition, it was shown that the presence of the glucose moiety was not necessary for collagen synthesis.37Asiaticoside im - proved wound healing in both normal and delayed healing models214 AYURVEDIC HERBSowing to increased collagen synthesis and angiogenesis,38and was also shown to enhance induction of antioxidant levels at initial levels of healing in excision type cutaneous wounds in rats.39 In a study with 27 patients with slow healing wounds of varied etiology, patients were treated topically with an ointment containing1 percent Centella asiatica extract or with a 2 percent powder in addi - tion to three intramuscular injections of asiaticoside per week. Accel - erated healing of wounds was seen in 55 percent of patients, withimprovement in 15 percent. The remaining 30 percent of patientsshowed no perceptible effect of treatment. 40In another study, 64 per - cent healing was observed when a preparation in which asiaticosidewas the major ingredient was used in patients with intractable andsoiled wounds. 41In another open study, a formulation containing 89.5 percent of Centella asiatica produced healing in 64 percent patients, whereas 16 percent showed improvement in wounds.42In second- and third-degree burns, topical application of a preparation ofCentella asiatica hastened healing, averted infection, and prevented the formation of hypertrophic scars. 43 In some individuals, hypersensitivity reactions can occur when Centella asiatica is applied topically;44however, it has been sug- gested that this could be due to other ingredients.45 NOTES 1.

The tolerability of a preparation of Azadi- rachta indica was studied in seven patients with second-degree burns and was found to be good, with an initial stinging, which passed off on continued application, and no other adverse effects reported.Healing took place in 4 weeks with burns epithelialized and scars be-ing soft, supple, and well pigmented. A randomized comparative trialwas then conducted with 17 patients who received either Azadirachta cream or silver sulfadiazine. Ulcer scores at the end of 2 weeks werefound significantly less in the neem group; epithelialization was better at 88.89 percent in the neem group as compared to 62.5 percent in the silver sulfadiazine group. In addition, in the neem group, the healing of cartilaginous areas was without deformity. Only in the sil - ver sulfadiazine group were complications such as sepsis, contrac - tures, and hypertrophy of scars noticed, leading the authors to con - clude that neem appeared to be a safe and effective prohealer. 1 NOTE 1.

Several plants have beenused in India for hastening the healing of fractures and for strength - ening the bones. Of these Cissus quadrangularis has been studied scientifically. There is increased interest in such plants, not only forhelp in bone healing when injured but also because of their possibleuse (see Plate 10 in color gallery) is a slender perennial climber with quadrangular stems, found leafless when old, growing throughout the hotter parts of India. The leaves and stemsare commonly used as a vegetable in South India: as a paste with len - tils known as chutney; or sometimes the stem juice is added to dried preparations such as papad that are later fried and eaten. The stem is considered to improve digestion and to be useful in piles, and is used widely in healing of fractures. The stems are administered orally and also applied topically to help heal fractures in dislocation and trau - matic injury. 2,3The Sanskrit, Hindi, and English names refer to this bone-knitting property of the plant. The plant contains unsymmetric tetracyclic triterpenes apart from /H9254-amyrin and /H9254-amyrone in the hexane extract. In addition, several alicyclic lipid constituents have been isolated. From the methanol fraction 3, 3/H11032,4 ,4 /H11032-tetrahydroxybiphenyl was also isolated.4TheSkin and Trauma Care Agents 219plant also contains calcium oxalate, vitamin C (398 mg per 100g fresh, tender stem), and /H9252-carotene.5 Experimental studies using S35were carried out to study the normal healing pattern of fracture in rats.6Weekly intramuscular injection of the alcoholic extract of Cissus quadrangularis (0.5 ml equivalent to 0.5 g of fresh drug) was found to accelerate fracture healing in smallanimals. 7,8Histochemical and biochemical studies showed a benefi - cial effect of the herb.9Isotopic studies using S35,P32, and Sr85showed that systemic use of the herb reduced healing time7,8,10by one-third.12 Topical application of a paste of Cissus quadrangularis increased the healing rate of treated animals by 10-14 days.11The total extract has a definite influence on both the organic and mineral phase of fracturehealing in experimental animals. Ca 45uptake studies showed that there was earlier calcification and remodeling owing to the drug. Inaddition, there was a 90 percent increase in tensile strength in treatedanimals as compared to 60 percent in untreated controls. 12Intramus- cular administration of the drug showed a stimulatory effect neutral-izing the effect on cortisone-treated fractures. 13In ovariectomized rats, feeding for 3 months with 500-750 mg\u00b7kg/H110021of an ethanolic ex- tract of Cissus quadrangularis showed significant increase in biomechanical strength comparable to raloxifene, a selective estro-gen receptor modulator currently used to treat osteoporosis. 14 In an open trial with controls, 78 patients were enrolled of which in 60 patients a paste of Cissus quadrangularis was applied after the fractured fragments were reduced, and the bone was immobilized inthe usual fashion with a cast. Of the patients who served as controls,18 were reduced and immobilized with a cast with no additionaltreatment. Patients were monitored every week and also checkedusing X-ray. The patients were assessed based on callus formation,improvement in the clinical picture, time of immobilization, and time required to return to normalcy. Patients using Cissus quadrangularis were found to experience some degree of itching, which has been attributed variously to the content of carnosine 2and calcium oxalate.5 Decreased swelling, greater freedom of movement; smaller callusformation, and 30-40 percent reduction in period of immobiliza - tion were some of the benefits of treatment with Cissus quadran - gularis. 2,15,16220 AYURVEDIC HERBSIn clinical practice in patients of jaw-bone fractures, it was found that addition of Ocimum sanctum andCissus quadrangularis along with the usual management of such fractures was found to reduce sig - nificantly the time of immobilization.17 Cissus quadrangularis is often used in food in South India to aid digestion. It is usually well tolerated in the usual doses.18When the paste of the plant is applied topically, patients were found to experi - ence some degree of itching, due to the content of carnosine2and cal - cium oxalate5that subsided without any treatment in a few days. This itching sensation can also occur when taken orally because of the cal - cium oxalate content. In experiments with Salmonella typhimurium tester strains Cissus quadrangularis was found to be mutagenic,19al- though the relevance of such experiments for human beings is not clear.

These have been used mostly as combination drugs, and single plants have not been the sub-ject of much scientific investigation. Much of the scientific interesthas been directed toward control of fertility, which is not covered inthis book. The herbs often used for the treatment of common prob-lems of women an increase in levels of prolactin, a hor- mone produced by the pituitary glands. A number of plants have beenused in Ayurveda to stimulate milk production, in case of lactationalinadequacy, both taken internally and also applied externally. How - ever, there is a dearth of scientific information on such plants. Asparagus racemosus Willd. (Family: Liliaceae, Asparagaceae) The use of roots of Asparagus racemosus for the treatment of duo - denal ulcers has been covered in Chapter 3. The roots are used in Ayurveda for stimulating milk flow and protecting pregnant womenagainst threatened abortion. In postpartum and estrogen-primed ratsintramuscular injection of the alcoholic extract of the roots was \u00a9 2006 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1300/5683_10 223shown to exert a lactogenic effect, increasing milk yield, and breast lobular-alveolar tissue, which has been attributed to an increase ofprolactin levels or to a release of corticosteroids. 1A galactagogue ac - tion was also goats.3The saponin fraction, es - pecially shatavarin I, has been shown to have an antioxytocic actionon uterine tissue and an anti-ADH 4,5activity supporting its use in threatened abortions. In an open exploratory study, 15 women withdeficient milk during lactation were given 2 tablets of a preparationcontaining Asparagus racemosus twice a day after meals. The trial drug contained 40 mg Asparagus racemosus extract, 10 mg pro - cessed iron pyrites, and 400 mg dicalcium phosphate. Out of the 15women, 11 reported an increase in milk yield together with improvedappetite. Four patients independently tried stopping the intake of thedrug and the milk yield was found to decrease, which improved once again with the resumption of the intake of the drug. 6 In a randomized controlled trial of Asparagus racemosus, in- crease in milk yield was not found different from placebo.7The preparation contained other herbs although Asparagus racemosus was the major herb in the trial preparation. The results are not nec- essarily attributable to Asparagus racemosus because of the addi- tion of other herbs. The trial preparation also led to a decrease inprolactin levels. However, considering the reputation of Aspara- gus racemosus in increasing milk yield, studies to clarify possible reasons for this lack of response are required, preferably afterstandardization of the product.

ANTILEUKORRHEAL PLANTS Leukorrhea or the white discharge from the vagina is commonly seen in women and termed sweta pradara in Sanskrit (sweta: white; pradara: discharge or flow). Clinical trial data with single herbs is scanty. A single herb for which an exploratory trial was herb found growing throughout India. The leaves and tender shoots are used as a vegetable. The root has anthelmintic activity and the root powder showed a significant therapeutic effect in the treatment of leukorrhea.1Fresh roots of Boerhaavia repanda were collected, shade-dried, powdered, and used in doses of 500 mg. In an open clinical study, 32 patients in the age group of 20-38 years with leukorrhea were asked to take 500 mg (1 tablespoon) of Boerhaavia repanda root powder twice a day for 30 days. All pa - tients reported marked improvement within a few days of treatment; white discharge stopped after 15 days but patients were asked to con - tinue treatment for a further 2 weeks. No side effects were noticed,except for a little nausea. 2 In an open study with controls, 20 female patients aged between 20 and 38 years with leukorrhea were asked to take 500 mg of the pow - der twice a day with milk or water for 15 days. A control group of 5 patients were maintained as control. At the end of the treatment pe - riod all 20 patients were found cured.3Gynecological Agents 225NOTES 1.The wealth of India, raw materials (vol. 2, p. 176).

ANTIMENORRHAGIAL PLANTS Excessive loss of blood during menstruation is termed menorrhagia. It has been suggested as due to hormonal imbalance in estrogen and progesterone. Bleeding between periods is termedmetrorrhagia. Excessive bleeding is termed raktapradara (rakta: blood; pradara: flow) in Ayurveda. A number of plants, especially those containing tannins, have been used to control menorrhagia;however, very few plants have been subjected to clinical trialsespecially as a single drug. a small evergreen tree found almost everywhere in India. The stem bark is extensively used in Ayurveda for the treatment of menorrhagia especially due to uterine fibroids, uterine disorders, andleukorrhea, and to treat depression in women. 1T h eb a r ki su s e di nn u - merous multiplant preparations in the market. It has, however, been littleinvestigated as a single drug. The bark has numerous polyphenolic that the bark has oxytocic activity in rats, guinea pigs, and isolated human uterinepreparations. The uterine response to the extract was dependent on226 AYURVEDIC HERBShormonal environment and the state of gestation. Estrogen-primed rats were more sensitive to the alcoholic extract.2A pure phenolic glycoside (P2) showed in vitro and in vivo oxytocic activity at very low concentrations on uteri of several species.3,4 Considering the importance of the drug in Ayurveda it has been clinically little investigated as a single drug. Only one small trial with 10 patients has been reported in which the drug was given parentally.Commercially available \"Injection Ashoka \" 2 ml of was given intra - muscularly in 10 cases of metromenorrhagia. All patients respondedto the treatment with good results and menstrual flow was normal - ized. 5Much more work is required experimentally to determine the mode of action in addition to holding clinical trials using the pudica is a common weed found throughout the warmer parts of India. The roots contain tannin (10 percent), mimosine, and calcium oxalate. In an exploratory clinical study in patients with dys-functional uterine bleeding, the aqueous extract of the root was givenin a dose of two to three 500 mg capsules thrice a day. The period oftreatment was variable from a few months to 4 years. The responsewas considered promising enough to warrant further studies. 6 NOTES 1. Sharma PC, Yelne MB, Dennis TJ (eds.).

Characteristics of the disease are symptomssuch as excessive thirst, hunger, weight loss, fatigue, blurred vision,etc. Diabetes has been described in Ayurveda in both the Caraka and Sushruta Samhita s under the name madhumeha or prameha meaning excessive urine ( pra: excessive). There is also a remarkable correspondence between the descriptions of the etiology and management of the disease in Ayurvedic texts andits allopathic correlates. The two types of diabetes described today areinsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), because of nonfunc-tional or damaged beta cells in the pancreas, and noninsulin-dependentdiabetes mellitus (NIDDM). A similar classification exists in Ayur-veda with caused due to congenital reasons and apa- thyaanimittaja prameha considered to occur due to unsuitable choice of food or consuming excessive food. 1 A large number of plants have been used in Ayurveda for the man- agement of diabetes mellitus, and 148 plants of 50 families have beenreviewed. As, elsewhere in Ayurveda, combination drugs are the pre - ferred mode of therapy. Some 40 plants have been used that have been reviewed by several authors. 2-4 Scientific work has focused on phytochemical examination, and in experimentally demonstrating hypoglycemic activity in small ani - mals made diabetic by alloxan, streptozotocin, and sometimes by adrenaline. Therefore, most studies have concentrated on the controlof hyperglycemia. \u00a9 2006 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1300/5683_11 229Only a few studies have been carried out to evaluate the effect of the drugs on complications of diabetes mellitus, such as nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy, which need to be addressed especially since synthetic oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin, which form themainstay of treatment of diabetes by controlling hyperglycemia,nonetheless have serious side effects and fail to alter the course of di - abetic complications. Eugenia jambolana and Momordica charantia have been shown to yield good results in the amelioration of diabeticcomplications such as diabetic nephropathy, 5fructose-induced insu - lin resistance,6and cataract7in experimental animals. The two plants also partially prevented diabetic neuropathy8in small animals. There are conflicting reports on the hypoglycemic activity of some plants that may be attributed to a number of factors such as botanical iden- tity of the drugs, time and place of collection, method of preparation,mode of administration, and type of experimental animal used. 2 Clinical data is generally of preliminary nature. There are roughly seven single plants, which have been studied in some detail, and these are covered here. Work on other potentially useful single drugs for which exploratory clinical work is available is presented in brief. Alsodiscussed are a few plants used clinically to treat diabetic complications.

Amelioration of experimental diabetic neuropa - thy and gastropathy in rats following oral administration of plant (Eugenia neem is a large evergreen tree found growing throughout India. It is also cultivated widely. The neem tree has been used since antiquity in India for a variety of ailments. Since the tree is found growing everywhere, it often serves to provide twigsthat are used as chewing sticks for cleaning the teeth and gums;leaves that are used for skin problems and during infections such as measles, chicken pox, etc. to help soothe itch. In addition, young leaves are plucked and chewed as a medicine to control blood sugarand to improve immunity. Flowers of the neem tree serve to control blood pressure and the seed kernel serves as an antifeedant for con-trolling insect attack. Leaves, seed oil, and bark of the tree have beenused to treat diabetes. Traditionally, neem has been used for the treat - ment of skin diseases, fevers including malaria and rheumatism and other inflammations. 1Every part of the neem tree is thus used for numerous indications. A very large number of substances have been isolated from differ - ent parts of the neem tree. These have been - fur compounds.1,2Antidiabetic Agents 231The aqueous leaf extract has been shown to produce hypoglycemia in small animals when administered orally at 200 mg\u00b7kg/H110021(10 per - cent w\u00b7v/H110021aqueous leaf extract)3and at 0.15 ml\u00b7kg/H110021(50 percent w\u00b7v/H110021aqueous leaf extract) when administered intravenously4to dogs. However, in another study, oral aqueous leaf extract, prepared by decocting the leaf, seed oil, and the compound nimbidin, wastested at dose levels of 1, 5, and 10 ml\u00b7kg /H110021body weight and it failed to reduce blood glucose levels, whereas seed oil at 2.5 ml\u00b7kg/H110021and nimbidin at 200 mg\u00b7kg/H110021body weight were active and exhibited sig - nificant hypoglycemic effect in both normoglycemic-fasted rabbitsand glucose-fed animals in glucose tolerance test. 5 Aqueous fraction of alcoholic6,7and methanolic extracts8ofneem 6and streptozotocin diabetic rats.7, 8 Fractions exhibiting hypoglycemic activity were found to be rich inflavonoid glycosides. 7An evaluation of the leaves and streptozotocin- diabetic rats for blood sugar lowering activity showed that A. indica leaf had the most potent blood sugar-lowering activity and the bestsafety margin. 9 In addition, neem leaf extract or seed oil exert their hypoglycemic effect in rabbits both when given as pretreatment before alloxan or af-ter induction of diabetes suggesting that neem could be useful for control of blood sugar in diabetes, and also for helping to retard or toprevent onset of the disease. 10Neem oil has been shown to reduce blood glucose levels in several experimental models in rabbits,11and in both normal and alloxan-diabetic rats.12 A series of studies have been carried out to elucidate the mecha - nism of action. It has been suggested that neem extract is an effective hypoglycemic agent only in animals having residual and healthy betacells and it can act only in the presence of a stimulus, such as an exter - nal glucose load. Neem increases peripheral glucose utilization by blocking the effect of epinephrine on glucose metabolism. 13How - ever, in an in vitro experiment neem extract did not enhance glucose uptake or glycogen synthesis in isolated rat hemidiaphragm.14Neem232 AYURVEDIC HERBSleaf extract also blocks in a significant fashion the serotonin inhibi - tion of insulin secretion mediated by glucose.15 In an exploratory clinical trial, 5 g of fresh tender A. indica leaf paste or an equivalent amount of dried leaf powder filled in capsules given to type I diabetics enabled five out of seven patients to reducetheir insulin dosage by 30-50 percent, while maintaining their bloodglucose values. 16 In an open uncontrolled study on 85 patients of type II diabetes, who were on conventional allopathic drugs, 5-10 drops per day ofneem seed oil in soft gelatin capsules was given in two divided doses along with the prescribed treatment. Neem oil was found to act in a synergesic manner to conventional drugs, and it was possible to re - duce the dosage of other oral antidiabetic drugs and insulin, based onthe response of the blood glucose levels of patients to treatment. 17 In an open preliminary study, patients with secondary diabetes were given varying doses of neem oil depending upon severity of dia- betes: those with mild diabetes received 5 drops, those with moderatediabetes received 10 drops, and those with severe diabetics receiving15 drops of neem oil twice a day. Patients experienced relief in symp- toms such as itching, dyspepsia, fatigue, and muscular pain. In addi-tion, patients had improved wound healing. The oil was evaluated asuseful in mild and moderate diabetes, and was found to have 50 per-cent effect on patients with severe diabetes. 18 Considering the preliminary but promising nature of results, fur- ther work is required in studying the material being used in the clini-cal trials and in using larger patient numbers for evaluation. Also tobe evaluated is the safety of the preparations. The use of tender neem leaves for health and in diabetes is recom - mended in traditional medicine, not only in the geriatric population, butalso in the pediatric age group of infants. After a review of literature, in - cluding various toxicity studies, the leaf, bark extract, and isolatedliminoids were considered to have a wide margin of safety. 1In another review of literature, the leaf extract had experimental LD50values ranging from 10 to 13 g\u00b7kg/H110021bodyweight.19Neem seed oil has shown toxicity, which, as suggested, may be due to contamination withseeds of Persian lilac or Melia azedarach, 1or due to aflatoxins. How obtained by debittering, deodorizing, andAntidiabetic Agents 233decolorizing is nontoxic,20suggesting the importance of developing chemical profiles of raw materials and isolated compounds, which could help in evaluating the possible toxic effect of a preparation byidentifying its toxic compounds. Coccinia grandis indica is a climbing or prostrate perennial herb found growing throughout India and the Indian subcontinent. All parts of the plant are used, including leaves, stem, fruits, and roots. The drug has traditionally been used for the treatment of skin problems, respi- ratory disorders, and for diabetes. Coccinia indica is well known in Bengal for the treatment of diabetes, where it is reputed to be anIndian substitute for insulin. It is considered to be very effective in re-ducing urine sugar levels. 21There are two varieties recorded\u2014the wild variety with greenish bitter nonedible fruits and the cultivatededible variety C. indica var.palmata that is sold in the market as a vegetable. Fruits of C. indica var.palmata have been shown to have more potent hypoglycemic activity and are preferred over the wildvariety for treatment of diabetes, 22although usually the wild bitter va - riety is preferred for use in medicine.23 From the aerial parts of C. indica var.palmata, heptacosane, tria - contane, cephalandrol, /H9252-sitosterol, and the B\u2014have been isolated. From the fruits, lupeol, /H9252-amyrin, and its acetate\u2014cucurbitacin B and pectin\u2014have been isolated.24The fruit pectin has been shown to produce significant reduction in blood glu - cose levels.25 The different parts of the plant have shown a varied response when tested for hypoglycemic activity. Root extracts, either aqueous or234 AYURVEDIC HERBSalcoholic, have betic rabbits26,27and rats,28and in glucose loaded29,30and fasted rats.30 Alcoholic extract of the fruits inhibited in rats, though not signifi - cantly, the hyperglycemic effect caused by anterior pituitary extract31\u2014 corticotropin and somatropin.32Decoction of fruits of C. indica W&A at 20 ml\u00b7kg/H110021showed significant hypoglycemic activity in glucose- fed fasted rabbits. The edible fruits of C. indica var.palmata was found to be more potent than that of C. indica W & A. Thus the fruit juice of the wild variety did not show any activity whereas the fruit juice of C. indica varpalmata at 20 ml\u00b7kg/H110021showed very significant activity (p < 0.001) at the end of the fifth hour.22The pectin isolated from the fruits at 200 mg per 100 g body weight has been shown to re- duce blood glucose levels in normal rats by enhanced glycolysis,glycogenesis, and decreased glycogenolysis. 25 Alcoholic extract of leaves of bimbi reduced blood sugar levels in guinea pigs33and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.34,35Depressed synthesis of blood glucose was due to depression of the enzymes glu-cose-6-phosphatase, 34,35fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, and enhanced glucose oxidation.34 In a double-blind clinical trial, tablets made from freeze-dried leaves of C. indica were tried on 16 patients with uncontrolled matu- rity-onset diabetes in the treatment group, and 16 patients in the pla-cebo group received placebo tablets made from chlorophyll. Patients received 3 tablets, weight of tablet not mentioned, 37twice daily for 6 weeks. Ten patients on the drug showed significant improvement in glucose tolerance (p < 0.001), whereas none of the placebo group showed such marked improvement.36,37Maximum effect was seen af- ter 3 weeks, and no adverse effects were observed. In an open trial, 41 patients with diabetes mellitus were treated with either C. indica p o w d e ro rj u i c e .O ft h e s e2 4w e r eg i v e n3go ft h ep o w - der twice daily with water before food for 5 weeks and 17 were given30 ml drug juice, prepared from a fresh plant, twice daily before food.Response was seen within 7 days, evaluated based on reduction ofblood sugar levels and relief of classical symptoms such as excessive urine, thirst, hunger, fatigue, numbness, and blurred vision. Excellent response was seen in 80 percent of the patients on powder and 47 per - cent on juice. No side effects were seen. 38Antidiabetic Agents 235Along with the normal diet 50-100 g of C. indica powder per day was given to 100 hyperglycemic patients, in the age group of 25-70 years, and 60 healthy volunteers. Significant results were seen from the firstweek. Lowering of blood cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins, andserum triglycerides were seen with an increase in high-density lipo - proteins. 39 Coccinia indica showed glycemic control in noninsulin-dependent diabetic patients, who did not respond to diet therapy alone. The drugshowed moderate blood sugar lowering property that increased withuse in subsequent months. 40 Dried aqueous extract of fresh leaves of C. indica was made into 3 g pellets, which were again oven dried and 1 pellet was given twice aday before food to 25 NIDDM patients. Group 1 was a control groupof 15 healthy controls, Group 2 consisted of 30 untreated patients,and Group 3 consisted of 25 patients treated with C. indica a n d1 5w i t h the oral drug \"Diabenese\" (chlorpropamide) for comparison. Diet was restricted and follow-up was done at 6-week intervals for two consecutive periods. The herbal drug was found to be effective incontrolling both hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia at the end of6 weeks. Reduction of blood sugar in the C. indica group was compa- rable to Diabetese. 41 To study the influence of C. indica on certain enzyme levels, dried extract of 50 mg\u00b7kg/H110021body weight\u00b7day/H110021ofC. indica was given twice a day before food to 30 diabetic patients both IDDM and NIDDM for6 weeks. Treatment significantly restored the reduced activity of lipo-protein lipase (LPL), and lowered the levels of glucose-6-phosphataseand lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which are raised in severe diabetics.The authors postulate that the ingredients of C. indica extract act like insulin to correct the elevated levels of glucose-6-phosphatase andLDH in the glycolytic pathway, and restore the LPL in the lipolyticpathway with the control of hyperglycemia in diabetes. 42 Considering the positive results obtained, further trials are needed with a larger number of patients. In addition, the composition should bestandardized in order to obtain consistent results. C. indica belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family. The fruits of the cultivated variety of C. indica are commonly eaten as a vegetable and therefore considered safe to use.In the clinical trials no side effects and toxicity were observed. 37,38236 AYURVEDIC Gymnema sylvestre (see Plate 11 in color gallery) is a woody climber found growing extensively in the southern and central parts of India. The leaves of the plant when chewed have the peculiarity ofnumbing the tongue so that one is not able to recognize sweet or bittertastes. Hence the Hindi name gurmar that means destroyer of sweet (gur: sweet; mar: destroyer). This has been shown in humans to be owing to the presence of triterpene acids known as gymnemic acidsand in rats due to a 35-amino acid peptide called gurmarin. 43The leaves have been used for the treatment of diabetes for a long time.The plant is considered a stomachic, a stimulant, a diuretic, and a lax-ative. It is said to be useful in cough, biliousness, and sore eyes. 44 From the leaves of Gymnema several oleanane and dammarane triterpene saponins have been characterized. the oleanane triterpenoid saponins are the gymnemic acidsthat been isolated from the aqueous extracts. Fractions contain-ing gymnemic acids have shown hypoglycemic activity. Gymnemicacid IV has been shown to increase the plasma insulin levels instreptozotocin-diabetic mice. 45Apart from tartaric acid, formic acid, and butyric acid have been isolated andtheir structure determined. 46 There are a number of animal studies regarding the beneficial ef - fect of Gymnema on diabetes. Administration of gurmar leaf powder to alloxan-diabetic animals regulates blood sugar levels47,48inducing protracted longevity.48In addition to blood glucose homeostatis, en - zyme activity controlling glucose utilization by insulin-dependentpathways was also increased. 47 In glucose-fed streptozotocin-diabetic rats glucose homeostatis was observed49-51by feeding leaf extracts possibly because of in - creased serum insulin levels50caused by regeneration of the islets ofAntidiabetic Agents 237Langerhans51and/or by increasing cell permeability.52It has been suggested that extracts containing gymnemic acids suppress eleva - tion of blood glucose levels by inhibiting glucose uptake in the intes - tine.49,53Gymnemic acid IV , but not gymnemic acid I-III or gymnem - asaponin V , at dose levels of 3.4-13.4 mg\u00b7kg/H110021reduced blood glucose levels by 13.5-60 percent 6 hours after administration in a manner similar to glibenclamide. Also at 13.4 mg\u00b7kg/H110021, plasma insulin levels were increased in streptozotocin-diabetic rats suggesting that thismay contribute to the antihyperglycemic activity of the leaves. 45 Lipid abnormalities found in alloxan-diabetic animals was restored to near normalcy by feeding with the hypoglycemic leaf extract ofGymnema sylvestre. 54This activity of the leaf extract given at 100 mg\u00b7kg/H110021in hypolipidemic rats for 2 and 10 weeks55,56was found to re- duce triglyceride and total cholesterol clofibrate.55 containing 363.3 mg\u00b7g/H110021of gymnemagenin57 and leaf been shown fecal cho- cholic acid-derived addition, gymnemic absorption of oleic acid in the intestine. 59Increased glycoprotein levels, which are considered the major cause ofnephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy and found elevated instreptozotocin-diabetic rats, were brought under control by adminis-tration of leaf extract GS 4.60 Clinical studies have been conducted using the leaf powder and concentrates from the leaves containing gymnemic acids. In an earlyexploratory trial, ten healthy normal persons and six diabetics withmild-to-moderate hyperglycemia were given an aqueous decoctionof powdered leaf of gurmar at a concentration of 10 g per 100 ml. The dose was 2 g thrice daily for 10 days. After 10 days, there was a defi - nite fall in blood glucose levels after glucose tolerance test, whichwas significant only in diabetics. Fasting blood glucose levels hadfallen significantly both in normal and diabetic patients. 61 The two studies used the concentrate named GS4,obtained by ex - traction of the leaves with 50 percent aqueous ethanol51,60precipitation with hydrochloric acid followed by recrystallization of the crystalswith aqueous ethanol. In 22 NIDDM patients on conventional therapy,oral were glucose, glycosylated hemo - globin, and glycosylated plasma proteins because of which the dosage of conventional drugs glibenclamide or tolbutamide could be de - creased or stopped. Thus 5 of the 22 patients could stop conventionaltherapy and manage with GS 4alone. During supplementation most of the patients reported a sense of well-being, better alertness, and less ex - haustion when doing work.62 GS4was administered orally to 27 IDDM patients along with their daily insulin injection for varying periods ranging from 2 to 30 months.None of the patients had symptoms of renal damage, retinopathy, or car - diovascular damage. These patients were compared with a control group of 37 patients on insulin therapy alone. Patients on GS 4were able to reduce their insulin dose with reduction of blood glucose lev- els, glycosylated hemoglobin, and glycosylated plasma protein lev-els. Plasma lipid levels came back to near normal levels. In addition,there was a sense of well-being, an improved ability to do work to-gether, and increased mental alertness. In the control group on insulintherapy alone, there was no significant decrease in blood lipid levels,fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and glycosylatedplasma proteins or serum levels. Therapy the extract GS 4appears to enhance endogenous insulin, accord- ing to the authors, by regeneration or revitalization of the residualbeta cells. 63 In another open trial, the hypoglycemic activity of Gymnema sylvestre leaf powder, at a dose of 10 g per day when administered for 7 days to 16 normal persons and 43 mild diabetics, was studied. After7 days, 36 diabetics received tolbutamide, whereas the remaining sevendiabetics received Gymnema sylvestre powder alone for 2 more weeks. Fasting blood sugar levels of the seven diabetics on gurmar powder for 3 weeks showed improved glucose tolerance. Lipid levels in normal per - sons remained unchanged, whereas in diabetics there was a significantdecrease in total cholesterol, serum triacylglycerol, and free fatty acids.Gymnema sylvestre also showed a definite hypoglycemic effect in both normal subjects and in diabetic patients, and the effect in diabetics wasevaluated as comparable to that of tolbutamide. 64 The water-soluble portion GS of the alcoholic extract of Gymnema sylvestre leaves, containing acids (A-D) 239and magnesium ions obtained by fractionation of the extract using bioassay, was given orally at dose levels of 120-360 mg daily to 61 di - abetic patients in the age group of 23-60 years. In 70 percent of the cases glucose homeostatis could be achieved using GS with resultsbeing seen in 2-4 weeks. The authors concluded that GS is useful inNIDDM patients who are poorly controlled by standard therapy.There was no abnormality in the biochemical investigations, such asblood count, hemoglobin, liver function tests, and nonprotein nitro - gen, when carried out after 1 year of therapy. 65 Gymnema sylvestre leaves and stem are extensively used in Gujarat, India, for the treatment of diabetes.66Preparations of the leaves and extracts are widely available in Japan as health foods in theform of tea bags, tablets, beverages, and confectionary. 57The leaves and stems have been considered nontoxic to human beings.66In a trial with Gymnema sylvestre extract known as GS4there were no undesir- able side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, lassitude, or other gastroin-testinal disturbances. Patients reported an increased sense of well-beingand a few female patients experienced relief of pain in the limbs. 63In a 1-year clinical trial, consumption of GS fraction from Gymnema sylvestre by type II diabetic patients showed no abnormality in blood count, hemoglobin, liver function test, and nonprotein nitrogen.65 Rats that were fed extract powder of Gymnema sylvestre for 1 year in graded amounts ranging from 0.01 to 1 percent of diet were examined weekly up to 12 weeks, then at 26, and finally at 52 weeks showed notoxic effects at 1-percent level in the diet as seen from hematological,biochemical, and histological examination. In addition, there was nochange in food consumption and in body weight. Momordica charantia is a slender climber with yellow flowers found growing throughout India. It is also cultivated countrywide for240 AYURVEDIC HERBSits fruits, as it is a commonly eaten vegetable despite its bitter taste. The plant bears gherkin-shaped fruits with protuberances that aresold in the market when green, and there are several types available indifferent sizes big and small and shades of green. 68The green fruits are sliced and dried in the sun to preserve them, in order to be con - sumed during the off season. The fruits are also popularly used for the treatment of diabetes, for which the cultivated variety of big fruitsis used; the small fruits variety is generally preferred in medicine. 69 However, a study with two varieties of karela showed that the bigger fruits were more effective than the small, oval, dark-green fruits inalloxan-diabetic rabbits with mild ketosis. 70The fruits, leaves, and roots have been commonly used as a folk remedy for diabetes. Thefruits are considered a cooling bitter tonic, useful as a stomachic andcarminative. They are also used for the liver and spleen and for goutand rheumatism. 68 A large number of compounds have been isolated from the fruits of Momordica charantia.71The saponins and proteins are found to be important for the hypoglycemic activity. Of these the polypeptideknown as p-insulin, 72(which has 17-amino acids and 166 residues, and has the same amino acid composition except for an extra methionine res-idue when compared to bovine insulin) and charantin, 73(which is a steroidal glycoside and momordicin Ic 74are considered responsible for the hypoglycemic activity although p-insulin itself does not act orally.Also contributing to the hypoglycemic activity is the pyrimidinenucleoside vicine, 75which is found in the seeds. Other steroidal glycosides found in the fruit are momordicines and the cucurbitinglycosides\u2014momordicosides. 71 The hypoglycemic activity of the fruit and seeds has been studied ex - tensively in different animal models76-85and the work was reviewed in 1996.71Fruit juice causes glucose tolerance in alloxan-diabetic rabbits but not in normal animals. P-insulin has been shown to be a very effec - tive hypoglycemic agent when administered subcutaneously to gerbils,langurs, and humans. 72Charantin was found to produce a lowering of blood glucose concentration when administered either orally or intrave - nously.73,86Oleanolic acid 3-O-glucuronide and momordicin 1 c exhibitAntidiabetic Agents 241hypoglycemic activity by suppressing the transfer of glucose from the stomach to the small intestine, and by inhibiting glucose transport.74 Intraperitoneal administration of vicine caused a hypoglycemic re - sponse in fasting albino rats.75 Fruit juice causes significant (p < 0.004) increase in the number of beta cells in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice,87although an ear - lier study reported lack of any significant effect on the ability to toler - ate external glucose load in diabetic mice by administration of 10ml\u00b7kg /H110021fruit juice for 30 days, which was attributed to the lack of via - ble beta cells capable of secreting insulin upon stimulation in order toexert its oral hypoglycemic effect. 88 Fruit juice of Momordica charantia h a sa l s ob e e ns h o w nt ob eap o - tent scavenger of superoxide and hydroxyl radicals.89Four different preparations of karela \u2014fruits, juice, seed extract, freeze-dried juice, and commercially available capsules showed that in healthy rats thehypoglycemic activity of fruit juice, freeze-dried fruit juice, and seedextract were comparable and they showed significant improvement inthe ability to tolerate an oral glucose load, whereas commercial cap-sules did not significantly improve glucose tolerance. 90 Studies of rats with diets supplemented with 0.5-3.5 percent of freeze-dried powder of fruit for 14 days both in the presence and ab-sence of dietary cholesterol showed that there was a marked reduc-tion of hepatic total cholesterol, triglyceride levels, and an increase inHDL-cholesterol. 91In streptozotocin-diabetic rats, long-term feeding for 10 weeks of fruit extract brought elevated lipid levels back tonear-normal values. 92 Fruit extracts of Momordica charantia when fed at 4 g\u00b7kg\u00b7day/H110021per rat to murine alloxan-diabetic rats retarded the formation of cataract.Thekarela -treated diabetic mice developed cataract in 140-180 days, whereas controls receiving 0.9 percent sodium chloride solution devel - oped cataract in 90-100 days. 93Karela extracts (200 mg\u00b7kg/H110021) fed daily prevented, to a significant extent (p < 0.05), renal hypertrophy in dia - betic rats.94Aqueous extracts of karela at 400 mg\u00b7day/H110021prevented, sub - stantially, hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia induced by a highfructose diet. 95 Experimental evidence obtained so far suggests that karela exhibits its hypoglycemic activity through inhibition of glucose absorption96and242 AYURVEDIC HERBSalso tends to be extrapancreatic, independent of glucose absorption in the intestine.80Thus also seen in the experimental studies are increased utilization of glucose by the liver,83,97inhibition of glucose synthesis while increasing glucose oxidation,98and decreased insulin resistance by increasing the amounts84of the transporter protein GLUT.84The de - pressed carbohydrate enzyme levels in the liver of diabetic mice werepartially restored to normal, 99whereas oxidative stress was reduced by normalizing disturbed glutathione S-transferase distribution.100Momor - dicin Ic and oleonolic acid-3-O-glucuronolide inhibit transfer of glucosefrom the stomach to the intestine, and inhibit glucose transport to thebrush border of the small intestine. 74In addition, karela is shown to cause regeneration of beta cells in streptozotocin-diabetic rats86and exhibit an insulinomimetic or insulinogogue effect.101-103 An experimental study in different animal models, using different doses, was carried out to find out the scope of use of karela in diabetes of varying intensity. The study showed that karela is best used for control- ling hyperglycemia in mild-to-moderate noninsulin-dependent diabeticsonly. The extracts had no adverse effect on various hematological pa-rameters. Karela extracts were found to differ from insulin in four ways\u2014oral administration; a delayed onset with a sustained duration ofaction; increase in the peripheral utilization of action even in tissues thatare insulin dependent, for example decrease of glycogen even in thekidney; and a longer duration of action. 99 Momordica charantia has been studied in small groups of patients by Vaclad, who noticed that blood sugar was significantly lowered inpatients administered fresh fruit juice or tablets prepared from fruitpowder. 104-106 Inspired by reports of use of karela in diabetes107,108and of its possible effect on the other drugs being consumed by diabetics, a study wascarried out on nine NIDDM patients of Asian origin. Coadministration ofa water-soluble extract of the fruits during a 50 g glucose tolerancetest significantly reduced blood glucose concentrations without anyinfluence on the insulin levels. Since karela is often eaten in the form of curry as part of the diet, the addition of fried karela fruits to the daily diet for 8 to 11 weeks was also investigated. This produced asmall but significant improvement in the glucose tolerance with noAntidiabetic Agents 243increase in insulin levels. In addition, there was a significant reduc - tion in glycosylated hemoglobin levels.109 Similarly a beneficial effect was seen in eight NIDDM patients given daily powdered karela fruit for 7 weeks. Improvement in glu - cose tolerance and fasting blood glucose levels was observed.110There was a significant glucose tolerance in 73 percent of maturity-onset di - abetic patients, who were administered fruit juice of karela, whereas the remaining 27 percent failed to respond.111 Aqueous extract of fruit given for 3-7 weeks resulted in a signifi - cant fall in postprandial blood sugar levels. There was a marked fall in both the blood sugar and the urine sugar levels; the hypoglycemiceffect takes place in a cumulative and gradual manner unlike thatwhen using insulin. The aqueous extract, with a fall in blood sugar of54 percent, was found to be more effective than the dried-fruit pow-der, with a fall in blood sugar of 25 percent, after 3 weeks of therapy.There was also significant reduction of glysoylated hemoglobin atthe end of the trial. 112 The effect of aqueous homogenized suspension of the green fruit pulp of M.charantia, given to 100 moderate NIDDM patients 2 hours after the intake of 75 g of glucose, was studied. There was a signifi-cant reduction (p < 0.001) in postprandial serum glucose levels in 86 percent of the patients and fasting glucose levels in 5 percent of thecases. 113 In an open study in Germany, 41 NIDDM patients took a 500 mg capsule of Momordica charantia extract, containing at least 10 per - cent charantin, twice a day prior to the two main meals, for 24 weeks.In the group of patients considered to have moderate diabetes, withfasting glucose /H33355200 mg\u00b7dl /H110021and HbA1c/H333558.0 percent, the blood glu - cose levels fell by 25 percent and the HbA1cby 0.5 percent bringing them into the classification of patients with glucose intolerance, andtherefore less prone to late complications of diabetes. No adverse ef - fects were noted during the course of the trial. 114 P-insulin administered subcutaneously led to a significant hypogly - cemic fall in six IDDM, one NIDDM, asymptomatic diabet - ics.115In another study, subcutaneous p-insulin led to a significant fall in blood glucose levels in 11 IDDM patients; however, no significant effect244 AYURVEDIC HERBSwas seen in eight NIDDM patients. A single IDDM patient could be maintained on p-insulin for 5 months.72 Momordica charantia fruits are commonly eaten as a vegetable in India with no untoward effects. However, it can cause loose motionsand stomachache 114when consumed in large quantities, probably be - cause of its bitter taste and its known laxative and emetic action.116In a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an extract ofMomordica charantia, no adverse effects were observed, leading the authors to conclude that the extract at the dose employed was a safenutraceutical without any toxic side effects. 114Some adverse effects in animals have been reported, for example, changes in testicularfunction in dogs 114and uterine hemorrhage in pregnant rats,117empha- sizing the need for caution in use in pregnancy and supervision by aphysician when coadministered with other drugs for diabetes in thecontext of the known synergesic deciduous tree found commonly in the hills in south and central India. The tree yieldsone of the most important timbers of India. Pterocarpus marsupium is well-known for its use in skin diseases and in diabetes. The sapwood ispale-yellowish white to white and the heartwood is golden-yellowishbrown in color, which stains yellow when it is moist; 119the yellow color is probably indicative of the flavonoids present in the wood. The heart - wood of Pterocarpus marsupium is considered to be useful for diabetes and has been the subject of a multicentric clinical study undertakenby the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to establish itsefficacy. (See later in this chapter.) In many parts of India, tumblersmade of the heartwood of Pterocarpus marsupium are sold in the market, and diabetics drink water stored overnight in these tumblersAntidiabetic Agents 245to control blood sugar levels. This folkloric use has been corrobo - rated by a small clinical trial.120 The heartwood is a rich source of flavonoids and other phenolic compounds.121From the alkali-soluble portion of the heartwood were isolated isoliquiritigenin, liquiritigenin, and pterostilbene, and from the sapwood, the heartwood marsupin, pterosupin,121marsupol, pro - pterol B.122The bark contains epicatechin and pterostilbene.122Among the compounds considered to have hypoglycemic activity are epicatechin,marsupin, and pterostilbene. Pterosupin and liquiritigenin have beenshown to be effective in reducing total cholesterol and lipid, and lipo-protein levels. 121 The oral hypoglycemic activity of Pterocarpus marsupium has been studied in a number of experimental models, using aqueous in-fusion of vijaysar in acute hyperglycemic extract was found to be more active than the alcoholic ex-tract, and also found to be active in both acute and chronic experi-ments in normal rabbits. In addition, the aqueous extract showed amore potent hypoglycemic effect than Gymnema in- dica. 125Administration of aqueous extract of vijaysar for 15 days re- sulted in reduced glucose absorption from the gastrointestinal tract,which was attributed to the action of tannates. 128Other workers also reported similar findings of blood sugar lowering.129,130 Pterostilbene from vijaysar, when administered intravenously to dogs, led to a fall in blood sugar at 10 mg\u00b7kg/H110021, whereas higher doses led to an initial hyperglycemia followed by hypoglycemia. It alsocaused a fall in the blood pressure of anesthetized dogs and wasfound to be toxic at 30 mg\u00b7kg /H110021.131The flavonoid fraction and the pure component (-)-epicatechin of Pterocarpus marsupium was shown to cause regeneration of the beta cells of the pancreas, which was con - sidered to explain its hypoglycemic action.132-134Some other authors were unable to repeat these studies135-138; however, later studies have shown that (-)-epicatechin has insulogenic as well as insulin-likeproperties. 139,140In addition, epicatechin has been shown in vitro to en - hance insulin release by conversion of proinsulin to insulin, which246 AYURVEDIC HERBSwas more pronounced in immature rat islets.141Marsupin and ptero - stilbene on i.p. administration to streptozotocin-hyperglycemic rats significantly lowered blood glucose levels, the effect being compara - ble to metformin (1,1-dimethylbiguanide).142 In order to work out a dose-response relationship, aqueous extract of vijaysar bark was administered to normal rats, glucose-fed hyper - glycemic rats, and alloxan-induced diabetic rats. At 1 g\u00b7kg/H110021given orally there was significant ( p> 0.001) reduction in blood sugar 2 hours after the administration of aqueous extract. In alloxan-diabeticrats, the aqueous extract of vijaysar on daily administration for 3 weeks produced a significant ( p< 0.001) lowering of blood glucose levels, which is slow in onset, starting from the first week and pro - gressing till the third week. 143In addition, the aqueous extract has also been shown to exert an anticataract effect in alloxan diabetic rats.144 The decoction of vijaysar bark extract showed hypocholesterolemic effect in rabbits.145The ethyl acetate extract of vijaysar administered for 14 days to rats with hyperlipidemia produced a significant reduc-tion of serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, and LDL- and VLDL-cholesterol levels. Among the active constituents of the vijaysar bark extract are liquiritigenin and pterosupin. 121 There have been a number of exploratory studies with small groups of patients. Only one open, multicentric trial has been re-ported by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) in 1998,which concluded that vijaysar was useful in the treatment of newly diagnosed or mild, untreated NIDDM patients. In a preliminary open clinical trial, 1 dram of heartwood extract of vijaysar was given thrice a day, after the main meals, to 14 diabetic patients on insulin. After a washout period of 5 days, only one patientshowed significant hypoglycemic activity. No side effects were ob - served. However, as part of the same study, the activity of vijaysar was compared with that of powdered seeds of Eugenia jambolana and it was found that 42 percent of patients responded at a dose levelof 1 dram three times a day of Eugenia jambolana as compared to 7 percent patients responding to vijaysar. 146It appears that vijaysar is not useful in IDDM patients. The decoction of the bark extract of vijaysar was administered to 22 diabetic patients at different dose levels. Glucose tolerance improvedAntidiabetic Agents 247in 12 patients after 7 days of treatment.147In another open study, 250 mg capsules of dried aqueous extract, prepared by decocting the heartwood, was given to 35 diabetic patients. A favorable response was found onlywith respect to urine sugar, with little effect on blood sugar levels. 148 In another trial, 20 NIDDM patients were divided into two groups often patients each. After a washout period of 10 days, ten patients whowere earlier on standard drugs such as chlorpropamide, tolbutamide, orphenformin had the drugs withdrawn and the patients were given 5 gvijaysar granules made from dried aqueous extract of vijaysar heart - wood powder thrice a day for 3 weeks, whereas the other group of tenpatients, who were freshly diagnosed with diabetes, were started straight-away on vijaysar. Both groups showed significant lowering of blood sugar. No major side effects were observed but two patients takingvijaysar had loose motions and gastric upset, controlled by reduction in the dosage. 149 Water stored overnight in a tumbler made of vijaysar heartwood is commonly used as a remedy for diabetes, as mentioned earlier. A smallclinical trial was carried out with ten patients, who were given 200 mlof the water, which was stored in the tumbler overnight, twice a day for1 month, taken after lunch, whereas water stored for the whole day wasdrunk after dinner. There was encouraging reduction of blood sugarfrom the second week of treatment and this hypoglycemic activity con-tinued as long as the heartwood water was given. 120 In an open trial with two groups, patients were administered either 500 mg of Saussurea lappa extract twice a day or 100 ml of Pterocarpus marsupium decoction twice a day after meals for 30 days. Both drugs were found effective in the management of diabetes and no side ef- fects were observed. There was a decrease in the mean postprandialblood sugar from the initial 283 mg percent to 241 mg percent afterthe treatment period, in patients treated with Pterocarpus marsu - pium. There was only a slight decrease in cholesterol levels. 150 An open, multicentric trial involving four centers and three dosage levels was carried out for 12 weeks to evaluate the efficacy of vijaysar in 97 newly diagnosed or untreated NIDDM patients. The aqueous extract, prepared by decocting the bark extract and evaporating it todryness, was administered to patients. Patients were assessed basedon blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels. It was found248 AYURVEDIC HERBSthat by 12 weeks, control of both fasting and postprandial blood glu - cose levels was attained in 67 of 97 (69 percent) patients studied. Blood sugar was controlled with an extract dose of 2 g in about 73 per - cent of patients, with 3 g in 16 percent of patients, and with 4 g in 10percent of the patients. Four of the patients had to be withdrawn fromthe trial owing to excessively high postprandial blood glucose levels.The fall in both fasting and postprandial levels by 32 and 45 mg\u00b7dl /H110021, respectively, after 12 weeks of treatment was significant (p < 0.001) starting from initial values of 151 and 216 mg\u00b7dl/H110021. There was also a significant decrease (p < 0.001) in the glycosylated hemoglobin lev - els from 9.8 to 9.4 percent. There was no significant change in meanlipid levels. No side effects were seen and all other laboratory param- eters remained stable during the treatment period. As a result of the trial it was concluded that vijaysar is useful in newly diagnosed cases of diabetes mellitus. 151 Thus the drug seems to be effective with an adequate dosage and careful selection of patients\u2014either newly diagnosed or untreatedNIDDM patients. The drug requires further investigation. In clinical tri-als with Pterocarpus marsupium no side effects have been noticed, 149-151 except for loose motions and gastric upset.149In small animals, extracts ofPterocarpus marsupium showed no untoward effect in doses is a group of climbing or creeping shrubs or small trees of which 18 species are found in India.152Over five species are used in Ayurveda and Siddha for the treatment of diabetes\u2014 Salacia prinoides, S. macrosperma, S. oblonga, S. fruticosa, and S. reticulata, that have varied locational distribution.152-154Of these, the three most commonly used are S. prinoides (=chinensis; latifolia ),S. oblonga, andS. reticulata. S. reticulata is also one of the most widely used plants for diabetes in Sri Lanka.155Preparations of S. reticulata are sold in Japan as a food supplement for obesity and di - abetes.156It is not certain from a study of literature whether carefully identified species have been used and, therefore, whether there areproblems in the interpretation of results. Roots and root bark ofSalacia species have been used in Ayurvedic medicine for the treat - ment of diabetes. Apart from this, the root has been used for treatingitch, rheumatism, and venereal diseases, such as gonorrhea. 152 The xanthone mangiferin has been isolated from the roots of several species\u2014 S. reticulata,157,158S. oblonga, S. is considered a synonym for S. prinoides.152 Also isolated from S. reticulata are and catechin Potent alpha-glucosidase aldose reductase have been isolated from stems ofS. reticulata, S. oblonga, andS. chinensis. 158,161,162 S. prinoides The hypoglycemic activity of infusion and decoction of root bark ofS. prinoides was studied in detail at different dose levels: 1g\u00b7kg/H110021 bodyweight of infusion showed hypoglycemic activity comparableto tolbutamide. 163Of the three Salacia species\u2014 S. prinoides, S. - rosperma, andS. fruticosa, the infusion of S. prinoides was found to exhibit maximum hypoglycemic activity at a dose of 1g\u00b7kg/H110021body - weight. S. fruticosa did not have potent hypoglycemic activity, al - though S. macrosperma exhibited some degree of hypoglycemic activity.164250 AYURVEDIC HERBSS. oblonga Two fractions derived from the petroleum ether extract of the root bark of S. oblonga showed 60 and 76 percent hypoglycemic activity of an equal dose of tolbutamide (250 mg\u00b7kg/H110021) in albino rats.165 S. oblonga root bark has significant blood sugar lowering activity and antioxidant property. Petroleum ether extract of root bark has also been shown to prevent streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia andhyperinsulinemia, and produce a significant decrease in peroxidationproducts in streptozotocin-diabetic rats. 166Aqueous methanolic extracts ofS. oblonga inhibited the increase of serum glucose level in su - crose- and maltose-loaded rats. The aqueous portion of this extractcontaining potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitors salacinol andkotalanol, along with nine other sugars, inhibited alpha-glucosidase,whereas the ethyl acetate extract containing known di- and triter-penes and a new triterpene kotalagenin-16-acetate extract decoction of root bark fed at 1 ml per rat per day to fasting rats caused a 30-percent reduction of bloodglucose levels, 3 hours after administration of the extract. 155Aqueous extract of S. reticulata (0.5-5 g\u00b7kg/H110021) reduced plasma glucose tration rats; the effect being maxi-mum at 1-5 hours after administration of extract. 167 Among the active constituents isolated is the xanthone mangiferin that has been shown to lower blood glucose levels in KK-Ay mice, ananimal model for type 2 diabetes. Mangiferin has also been shown to im - prove hyperinsulinemia, possibly by decreasing insulin resistance, 168 and to exhibit alpha-glucosidase and aldose reductase-inhibitory ac - tivities.158Other active ingredients include salacinol and which are potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitors.159-161 In India, Salacia reticulata is usually one ingredient of multiplant preparations in most products. Preparations of S. reticulata are available as herbal supplements for the treatment of obesity and diabetes in Japan.The extract, obtained by extraction of the roots with hot water have beenshown to prevent postprandial increase in blood sugar in humans. 169InAntidiabetic Agents 251addition, it decreased fasting blood sugar, glycosylated hemoglobin, and body mass index in mild NIDDM patients.170 As a single ingredient Salacia prinoides has undergone prelimi - nary exploratory clinical evaluation and has been found to possessboth hypolipidemic and hypoglycemic activity. Tablets of root barkofS. prinoides (Ekanayakam) 500 mg were given to 18 NIDDM pa - tients (fasting serum glucose levels of 120-160 mg\u00b7dl /H110021) at a dose level of 2.5, 3.5, and 5 g per day (six patients at each dose level),while six patients were kept as control with restricted diet just as thedrug group. There was efficient lowering of blood glucose, mean se - rum cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, and increase in HDL-choles-terol levels without any side effects with Salacia treatment. 171 In another open trial, 42 NIDDM patients were given either 500 mg tablets of Salacia prinoides alone or a 500 mg tablet of 1:1 mixture of Salacia prinoides andStrychnos potatorum for 2 months. A control group was managed with diet restrictions. Hypoglycemic and hypo-cholesterolemic activities were observed. There was a significant reduc-tion in blood glucose levels; however, reduction in blood glucose levelswas greater in patients who were on Salacia prinoides alone. 172 In another study, 25 patients were treated with 500 mg of S. prinoides (=chinensis ) powder along with triphala tablets 2.5 g thrice a day for 6 months, which brought down blood sugar and urine sugar levels.173 Triphala is a well-known Ayurvedic preparation containing, in equal fruits of Terminalia chebula, T. belerica, andPhy- llanthus emblica and used as a bowel tonic. There is an urgent need to conduct well-planned clinical trials to evaluate these potentially promising Ayurvedic drugs, and also toevaluate the relative efficacy of the different species. Preparations with Salacia reticulata are available in the Japanese market, and as a combination drug with other plants in India. The safetyprofile of the hot-water extract of Salacia reticulata in terms acute and toxicity, mutagenicity, and phototoxicity havebeen carried out. 174-176In pregnant rats root extract of S. reticulata at a dose level of 10 g\u00b7kg/H110021significantly increased postimplantation losses, leading the authors to recommend that it should not be used in preg - nancy.177However, the dose levels used seem to be high. The safety eval - uation of hot-water extract of Salacia oblonga at ten times the normal in -252 AYURVEDIC HERBStake for 2 weeks did not change the clinical chemistry or produce histological changes Naval Syzygium cuminii is a large evergreen tree found throughout India in the plains up to an elevation of 1,800 m,179that bears a large crop of subacidic, astringent fruits, which consist of an inner seed covered by a pink-to-purple pulp that can be eaten, that are sold in the market.Seeds of jambu have been used in India for a very long time for the treatment of diabetes although the fruit pulp and leaves are also usedin other parts of the world. It is also a very common household rem-edy for diabetes, especially in the villages in South India either by it-self or in combination with Gymnema sylvestre. The bark extract decoction is used in gargling for sore throat, spongy gums and stomatitis, and for dysentry and diarrhea. Leavesare used for diarrhea, especially in children. The vinegar made fromthe fruits is used as a stomachic, a carminative, and a diuretic drug.The seeds of the fruit are used in diabetes, where it is considered toreduce the quantity of sugar in the urine and to allay thirst. 179-181 The seeds contain several phenolic compounds including gallic acid, acid, corilagin, There have been a number of studies on the hypoglycemic effect caused by seeds and seed extracts of jambu. Oral administration of seeds ofjambu reduced blood sugar levels in different animal models185,186 comparable to chlorpropamide at doses ranging from 170 to 510 mg perrat, 185and comparable to phenformin at a dose of 1 g\u00b7kg/H110021in casein diet in streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rabbits.186In addition, there was significant decrease in postmeal values of cholesterol, free fatty acids,and triglycerides comparable to phenformin. 186Also observed was an in -Antidiabetic Agents 253crease of cathepsin B activity both by plant extract and chlorpropamide reflecting possible proteolytic conversion of proinsulin to insulin.185An aqueous suspension of seeds of jambu was tested for hypoglycemic ac - tivity at different dose levels ranging from 1 g to 6 g\u00b7kg/H110021body weight in rabbits. The maximum hypoglycemic effect of 42.64 percent, which wasshown at 4 g\u00b7kg /H110021dose level 3 hours after intake.187Aqueous, alcoholic, and acetone extracts of jambu seeds fed to albino rats at different doses for periods from 15 to 45 days produced significant hypoglycemic ef - fect. The acetone extracts also reduced cholesterol and serum urea lev - els. In addition, blood sugar levels once lowered continued to be stableeven for a fortnight after the treatment was stopped. 188Oral administra- tion of aqueous extracts of seeds of jamun (jambu) to alloxan-diabetic rats at a dose of 2.5 g and 5 g\u00b7kg/H110021body weight but not at the 7.5 g level for 6 weeks resulted in significant reduction of blood glucose levels,which was greater than glibenclamide. The extract also showed antioxi-dant activity but not at the 7.5 g level. 189At 2.5 g\u00b7kg/H110021there was an in- crease in hepatic hexokinase activity and a decrease of glucose-6-phosphatase in alloxan-diabetic animals. 190 Free radical scavenging activity of the methanolic extract of jambu seeds and of the major constituent of the extract, gallic acid, showed freeradical scavenging activity greater than ascorbic acid while that of themethanolic extract was comparable to ascorbic acid. The authors sug-gest that this free radical scavenging activity could be useful in preven-tion of cataract. 191This has been confirmed by another study that feeding lyophilized aqueous extract of the seeds at 200 mg\u00b7kg\u00b7day/H110021for 4 months prevented murine alloxan-diabetic cataract in rats.192 Daily administration for 21 to 120 days of lyophilized aqueous ex - tract of jambu seeds at 200 mg\u00b7day/H110021showed significant antihy - perglycemic activity in mild-to-moderate degree of hyperglycemia,partially restoring altered skeletal and hepatic glycogen content andenzyme levels. Some degree of activity was also exhibited in severelydiabetic mice (>400 mg\u00b7dl /H110021).193At 400 mg\u00b7day/H110021for 15 induced by adiet high in fructose. 194Renal hypertrophy was also prevented when fed at 200 mg\u00b7kg/H110021for 40 days when compared to diabetic controls.195 Despite the popular usage of jambu seeds there are only a few open clinical trials. In an early trial on 28 patients 4-24 g of jambu seed254 AYURVEDIC HERBSpowder was given thrice a day. Twenty patients showed significant fall in fasting and postprandial blood sugar, seven showed decreasesin postprandial blood sugar and an increase in fasting blood sugar,whereas one patient showed increases in both parameters. In addi - tion, patients showed improvement in signs and symptoms of the dis - ease. While there was no observable toxicity in the liver, kidney, andblood, side effects seen were nausea, diarrhea, and epigastric pain. 196 In an open clinical trial, 30 NIDDM patients were treated with 12 g of jambu powder given in three divided daily doses for 3 months. There was good control of blood sugar along with relief in symptoms that in - creased with duration of treatment. A control group of six patients werekept on chlorpropamide. Results with Eugenia jambolana were assessed as comparable to chlorpropamide. No side effects were observed. 197 A compound herbal preparation, consisting of 2 g each of pow- dered Gymnema sylvestre leaves and Syzygium cuminii seeds, was taken by 20 patients thrice daily for 6 weeks. Ten patients on restric-ted diets served as control. Seventy percent of the patients were foundto have responded well, based on biochemical parameters and reliefof symptoms such as frequency and quantity of urine, feeling of well-being, numbness and tingling of hand and feet, and itching. In addi-tion, the response was considered good in 13.33 percent of patients,whereas the response was considered poor in 16.67 percent of pa-tients. No side effects or toxicity was observed in rats. 198 The fruits of Syzygium cuminii are commonly and widely con- sumed in India; however, large quantities are not consumed becauseof the astringent nature of the fruits. In one clinical trial withSyzygium cuminii seeds, there were two cases of nausea, two of diar - rhea, and one of epigastric pain. 196Another trial, however, did not show any side effects and the drug was well tolerated.197Thus, clini - cal trials with standardized material and larger patient numbers areneeded to obtain a clear picture of the safety and efficacy of the herb. annual herb found growing wild in Punjab, Kashmir, and the upper Gangetic plains. It is also culti - vated extensively throughout India. Two types are known\u2014a dwarf type used for culinary purposes and a tall type used for fodder. Theseeds are common ingredients of curry, and the leaves are cooked andeaten as a vegetable. Dried leaves are sold in the market to add flavorand nutrition to food. The seeds are a common spice and also usedmedicinally. The seeds are aromatic, bitter, carminative, tonic, and agalactagogue. Internally it is used for inflammation of the gastroin - testinal tract, for diarrhea, and dysentry probably because of the mu - cilage present in the seeds. 199 The seeds are a rich source of dietary fiber with 45-60 percent total carbohydrates, mostly as soluble fiber present as mucilage, 20-30 per-cent protein, and 10 percent of fixed oil. There are also several steroidalsaponins in the seeds. The bitter taste of the seeds is because of thepresence of furostanol saponins. Also present are sterols, flavonoids,alkaloids such as trigonelline, 0.015 percent of an essential oil, 200and amino acids including the novel insulin secreting amino acid 4-hydro-xyisoleucine. 201 A number of studies have been carried out in small animals to find out the scope of hypoglycemic activity. An antidiabetic effect hasbeen shown in rats, dogs, and mice. 202-204In alloxan-diabetic rats greek extract205,206and nificant hypoglycemic effect. Pretreatment with fenugreek prior toproduction of diabetes by streptozotocin improved both blood glu - cose and lipid levels. 207The antidiabetic and hypocholesterolemic ac- tivity of fenugreek has been reviewed in 1998.208 Fenugreek seeds brought back altered creatinine kinase activity in the heart, skeletal muscle, and liver of diabetic rats back to normalvalues. 209Changes in hepatic and renal glucose210,211and lipid metabo - lizing enzymes211were also normalized. Fenugreek seeds have been shown to have an antioxidant effect.212The hypocholesterolemic activity has been reported by several authors.213-217Fenugreek is con - sidered to exert its antidiabetic effect in different ways\u2014through itsfiber content in a manner similar to guar gum both being rich ingalactomannans, 208,220through inhibition of intestinal glucosidase218 and through insulin release by 4-hydroxyisoleucine.201Trigonelline256 AYURVEDIC HERBSwas subsequently shown not to be active by administration in amounts present in fenugreek.219 A number of small clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the hypoglycemic activity of fenugreek. The hypoglycemic activityof fenugreek seeds and leaves was tested in normal subjects and dia - betic patients. In an acute study on healthy volunteers, a single doseof various forms of fenugreek were tried out\u201425 g seeds, 5 g gumisolate, or 150 g leaves being given, the seeds being administered infour different forms\u2014as whole seeds, defatted seeds, degummedseeds, and cooked seeds. Although the gum isolate and leavesshowed no hypoglycemic effect, maximal reduction of blood glucosewas shown by whole seeds. Therefore, in NIDDM patients 25 g offenugreek seed powder in two divided doses was mixed with theirusual diet for 21 days. There was significant reduction in bloodglucose levels and insulin response. In addition, there was significantreduction (p < 0.05) in 24-hour urinary glucose output and in choles- terol levels. 220 In type I diabetics,100 g of defatted fenugreek, given in divided doses at lunch and dinner for 10 days, significantly reduced fastingblood sugar, improved glucose tolerance, reduced 24-hour urinaryglucose excretion by 54 percent, and also showed a significanthypolipidemic effect. 221A similar study in 15 NIDDM patients, who were fed randomly meals in cross-over design and incorporated withor without 100 g of defatted fenugreek seed powder, produced similarresults. 222Also in type II diabetics, fed with 15 g of fenugreek seed powder soaked in water per day, there was postprandial lowering ofblood sugar level. 223 In a cross-over study to determine whether the improved glucose tolerance was owing to the effect of fenugreek on the absorption ormetabolism of glucose, the diet was either randomly incorporatedwith 25 g of fenugreek seed or left out in ten NIDDM patients aspretreatment for 15 days prior to intravenous glucose load. Resultsshowed that the addition of fenugreek to the diet significantly re - duced the area under the plasma glucose curve and increased glucoseclearance, suggesting that improved peripheral glucose utilizationcontributes to improved glucose tolerance. Fenugreek also signifi - cantly increased molar insulin binding sites of erythrocytes. 224Antidiabetic Agents 257Studies have also been conducted to observe the hypolipidemic ef - fect of fenugreek seeds in diabetic patients, who are known to be at risk of developing cardiovascular disease. An open long-term studywas carried on 60 NIDDM patients to study the effect of fenugreekon lipid levels. There was an initial control period of 7 days followedby an experimental period of 24 weeks when patients consumed 25 gof fenugreek seed powder in two divided doses as soup in water be - fore lunch and dinner. The was a significant fall in total cholesterol,LDL, and VLDL cholesterol, and also in triglyceride levels. 225 A double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted in order to evaluate the effects of fenugreek on glycemic control and insulin resis-tance in newly diagnosed mild-to-moderate NIDDM patients. In thetreatment group, 12 patients received 1 g\u00b7day /H110021of aqueous alcoholic extract of fenugreek seeds, whereas the control group of 13 patients re-ceived placebo capsules for 2 months along with diet and exercise. Pa-tients were randomly assigned either to treatment group or to placebogroup. Both groups were checked to make sure they had similar base-line values. At the end of 2 months both the fasting and after mealblood sugar levels were comparable in the two groups. However, areaunder curve of blood glucose and insulin was significantly ( p< 0.001) lower in the treatment group. There was also a decrease in insulin resis-tance and a significant decrease in triglyceride and increase in HDLcholesterol. 226 Fenugreek seeds are a commonly used spice in Indian cooking and the leaves are used as a vegetable. In clinical trials, generally, no sideeffects have been reported at lower dosage levels of 15-25 g seed; 223,224 however, with 100 g of fenugreek four patients complained of diar - rhea and flatulence.221In subsequent trials, a few patients had GI dis - turbances even at 25 g.225,226In a long-term study lasting 24 weeks, on diabetic patients who were administered 25 g of fenugreek seeds perday, there was no toxicity in the liver and kidney and no abnormalityin blood parameters. 227 No toxicity was observed in a short-term study of 90 days when rats were fed with equivalent of two and four times the human dosageof 25 g of fenugreek seeds, which is generally used in NIDDM pa - tients to improve glucose tolerance and lipid levels. Liver functiontests were normal as were liver histology and blood picture. 228258 AYURVEDIC HERBSNOTES 1. van der JM, de Silva KTD, Labadie 2. Chawla Kumar M, Bansal I.

In a study on 32 NIDDM patients with mild to moderate diabetes, two heaped tea - spoons of C. tamala leaf powder was given orally four times a day 0.5 hour before breakfast, lunch, tea, and dinner to find the effect on fast - ing blood sugar, glucose tolerance, and immediate response to intakeof the drug. Eight patients were kept as control with no treatment ex - cept for a restricted diet of 1,800 calories. After 1 month, the controlgroup showed a minor significant rise (p < 0.01) in blood sugar levels, whereas there was a significant fall in fasting blood sugar ( p< 0.001), in the treated group. It was also possible to show that the drug lowersblood sugar level after glucose load. In a third experiment on seven patients to see the immediate effect of 20 g of C. tamala on fasting blood sugar, the drug was given after collection of fasting blood samples. It was seen that the fall in bloodsugar started half an hour after the intake of Cinnamomum tamala, and the decrease continued upto 2 hours. The fall was significant atall points (p < 0.01). 1A radioimmunoassay study on five patients, to determine insulin levels in addition to fasting blood sugar levels,showed that fasting blood sugar dropped from 186\u00b142.34 mg percentbefore intake to 129.9\u00b125.39 mg percent at the end of 2 hours,whereas insulin levels changed from 16.83 before intake to 31 \u00b5u\u00b7g /H110021 at the end of 2 hours. When two heaped teaspoons of the drug weretaken for 15 days there was a significant fall in blood sugar levels(168.4\u00b125.25 to 111.8\u00b117.6 mg percent) after treatment. There wasalso a rise in insulin levels, which was not significant. 2 Experimentally a 50-percent ethanolic extract of the leaves of C. tamala significantly reduced the plasma glucose levels both in normal and streptozotocin-diabetic rats. In addition, the extract was able toprevent rise in cholesterol and triglycerides in diabetic 273In a study, 23 patients were divided into four groups. In the first group a 1:4 decoction prepared from 15-30 g of Clerodendron phlomidis was administered to 13 diabetic patients in daily divided doses for 5 weeks. In the second group of three patients, 500 mg of tolbutamide was given every day. The third group was given 30 unitsof insulin daily, whereas the fourth group was kept as control with nomedication and controlled diet. C.phlomidis treatment led to a re - sponse in 46 percent of the patients. There was a reduction of bloodsugar, urine sugar, and improvement in symptoms and in glucose tol - erance. The mean percentage fall of blood sugar with C.phlomidis as compared to tolbutamide was 7.1 versus 11 percent, whereas the fallin urine sugar was 18.2 versus 22.2 percent. No side effects were ob-served. clinical study on 25 patients with moderate to severe diabetes (250-400 mg per 100 ml) 1 g of Phyllanthus amarus led to statisti - cally significant lowering of blood sugar levels when given thrice aday for 3 months. 5In another study, a preparation of whole plant of Phyllanthus amarus was given for 10 days to nine mild hyper - tensives, four of whom were diabetic. There was a significant reduc - tion in systolic blood pressure in nondiabetic hypertensives and inwomen. Also blood glucose levels was significantly reduced in thetreated of C. tamala in patients of maturity onset (Insulin independent) diabetes. J Res Ayur Siddha I:275- 290 (1980).

DIABETIC COMPLICATIONS Diabetic foot One of the late complications of diabetes is the \"diabetes foot,\" which arises due to diabetic neuropathy, and not as thought earlier due to arterial complications, and results in a nonhealing, painlessfoot ulcer, which wrongly treated can traditionally been used both in - ternally and externally for the treatment of burns, wounds, fractures, bruises, insect bites, etc. Rubia cordifolia has potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. This has been made use of in the treat - ment of nonhealing diabetic foot ulcers (DFU).Antidiabetic Agents 275In an open comparative clinical study, 100 patients, with nonhealing DFU of 20-30 months duration, were divided into two groups of 50 each. Group I was given oral antibiotics for systemic use along with antisep - tics for topical use together with pentoxyfilline 400 mg thrice a day.Group II was treated by dipping the ulcer in Rubia cordifiolia extract and also by applying it topically as ointment. In addition, 500 mg of Rubia cordifiolia andBauhinia variegeta (kanchanara) was given orally thrice months. General health, arterial circulation, ulcer marginmeasurements, radiological, biochemical, and microbiological assess - ments were done every month. Recovery in group I on antibiotics was moderate and 60 percent un- derwent amputation, whereas group II showed very good recovery with only 10 percent partial amputation. 1 Diabetic neuropathy In patients of confirmed diabetic neuropathy, Sida cordifolia was given and found to help in the management of diabetic nerve prob- lems. Further details are not available.2 Diabetic retinopathy Asparagus racemosus Willd. (Family: Liliaceae) Another complication of diabetes is the effect on the vision or dia - betic retinopathy. Asparagus racemosus orshatavari , which was de- in Chapter 3 for use in peptic ulcer, is also considered in Ayurveda to improve the vision (chakshushya) . In an exploratory open trial, 30 diabetic patients were daily given 3 g of Asparagus racemosus root powder with water for 3 months, in addition to the antidiabetic treatment they were taking. It was found that there wasabsorption of vitriol and retinal hamorrhages, as well as soft and hardexudates. There was also improvement in parameters, such as venousdilation, microaneurysm, and neovascularization. According to theauthors the drug had helped reduce changes of diabetic retinopathy and also helped in preventing further development of lesions as a re - sult of diabetic retinopathy. 3276 AYURVEDIC HERBSNOTES 1. cers.

Chennai: Proc 277Chapter 12 Central Nervous System Agents The importance of the psyche in the cause of disease and in the maintenance of health has been recognized in Ayurveda, and plants have often been used to treat the Central Nervous System (CNS)disorders and retain mental ability even at a ripe old age. There is asophisticated system of classification in Ayurveda based on pharma-cological properties, and there are several categories described, in-cluding some with no equivalents in modern pharmacology. 1Among the several kinds of CNS drugs described in Ayurveda, the most im-portant and closely related to the antipyretics, anxiolytics, memoryenhancers, etc. 2About 85 drugs have been listed under different groups and some in more than one.3 NOTES 1.

The Sanskrit medhya is derived from medha meaning intellect and therefore promoting mental function. Rasayanas are considered to be rejuvenators used to maintain health and modify theill effects of aging. Several such plants that promote memory andlearning have been described in Ayurveda. A few of them have beeninvestigated to some extent and are described small herb with pale lilac flowers found grow- ing throughout India in moist areas. The name brahmi probably refers to Brahma's wife Brahmi\u2014the Goddess of Learning\u2014Saraswati\u2014 and therefore to its traditional use in improving retention and enhanc - ing memory, and thereby intellect. Two plants often go under the name brahmi \u2014Bacopa monnieri andCentella asiatica, a n dt h et w op l a n t s are the most commonly used medhya rasayana or mental rejuvenators; however, Bacopa monnieri is considered more powerful since it is used in the treatment of epilepsy and insanity, whereas Centella asiatica, known as mandukaparni in Sanskrit, is considered a general mental tonic because it is also used in small amounts as a vegetable1,2in food items such as salads, chutneys, and tea. Bacopa monnieri whole plant has the official status in the Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia, 2002, as a brain tonic.3 Chemical investigation of Bacopa monnieri has led to the isolation of several triterpenoid saponins of which Bacoside A, which is a mixture of280 AYURVEDIC HERBSseveral saponins and Bacoside B, are considered to be the active constit - uents responsible for the memory-enhancing properties of the herb.3,4 Bacoside A is a mixture of Bacoside A1\u2014a minor component\u2014Baco - side A2, and Bacoside A3\u2014which has been shown to be a potent inhibi - tor of superoxide.5,6Other components include hersaponin, betulic acid, alkaloids, flavonoids, and phytosterols3\u2014a number of other constituents have been isolated from the plant as well. Initial experimental studies focused on the antianxiety effects of the herb, which acting as tranquilizer led to improved mental functioning and better retention.7,8Subsequent studies conducted with the alcoholic extract of the plant or with a standardized extract have demonstratedimproved learning performance of rats in various stressful condi -tions. 4,9In addition, Bacopa monnieri mitigates the shock,10 phenytoin,11and morphine.12In aged rats Bacopa monnieri slows down memory loss at 1 mg per 100 g body weight taken once a day,13and in animal models of Alzheimer's disease, it has a memory-promoting ef-fect. 14Several groups of authors and researchers have demonstrated the antioxidant properties of Bacopa monnieri.15-17In addition, the free radical scavenging and protective effect of Bacopa monnieri is sug- gested to be mediated through the reduction of high concentrations ofnitric oxide produced by astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease, ischemia,and epilepsy. 18Among the active constituents, Bacoside A3has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of superoxide with Bacopasaponin Cshowing less potent activity, whereas the two other remaining mixturesafter isolation were not active. 6A standardized extract of Bacopa monnieri has been shown to exhibit antistress activity19by modulation of expression of cells involved in the brain.20Also Bacopa monnieri extract exhibits an antidepressant effect in experimental models of de - pression in rats.21 It is only in recent years that the interest in Bacopa monnieri has increased with more information becoming available. Initial clinicaltrials were carried out in the 1980s on the antianxiety effect on pa - tients with anxiety neurosis. In an open trial, 35 patients with anxiety neurosis were daily given 30 ml of Bacopa monnieri made into syrup in two divided doses (equivalent to 12 g crude drug) for 1 month. Patients were assessedCentral Nervous System Agents 281weekly based on clinical relief, psychological, physiological, and biochemical changes. Treatment resulted in the reduction in anxietylevels apart from significant reduction in symptoms, resulting in im - proved mental function, assessed as mental fatigue and immediatememory span. There was also reduction in the levels of urinaryvanillyl mandelic acid (VMA) and corticosteroids being excreted. 22 In another open trial, 36 subjects were divided into two groups: 18 normal subjects and 18 patients with anxiety neurosis. All subjects re - ceived one 500 mg capsule containing Bacopa monnieri extract equiv - alent to 2.5 g of dried drug thrice a day for 4 weeks. Treatment with thedrug led to significant improvement in anxiety levels and depression,mental fatigue, and memory span, apart from effects on systolic bloodpressure and rate of expiration. Patients also reported significant im-provement in nervousness, palpitation, headache, and insomnia. Re-sponse to the drug was more pronounced in patients than in healthyvolunteers. 23 In a safety and tolerability study conducted in a double-blind placebo- controlled noncross-over manner in 31 healthy human volunteers, singledoses of 20-30 mg of Bacosides A and B, as well as multiple doses of100-200 mg, were well tolerated. No untoward reactions or side effectswere seen. 24 In another study carried out in double-blind placebo-controlled in- dependent group design in order to examine the acute effects ofBacopa monniera extract on cognitive function in 38 healthy humans, the subjects were assigned to one of the two kinds of treatment: either300 mg Bacopa monniera extract ( n= 18) or placebo ( n= 20). Test- ing, carried out before the intake of drug and 2 hours after, showed thatthere was no acute effect at the dose given. 25 In a similar double-blind placebo-controlled independent group design, the chronic effects of administration of 300 mg of Bacopa monniera extract or placebo for 5 weeks and 12 weeks was studied. Neuropsychological testing done at baseline, after 5 weeks and after12 weeks showed significant improvement in the speed of visual in - formation processing, enhanced learning rate, and memory consoli - dation, and improved anxiety state in the Bacopa monniera extract group as compared with the placebo group. Improvement was maxi -282 AYURVEDIC HERBSmal at 12 weeks suggesting that Bacopa monniera exerts a favorable influence on learning and memory.26 In a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial, the chronic effects of administration of Bacopa monnieri extract was studied in 76 adults enrolled in the trial. Testing of various memory functions and the level of anxiety was done at baseline, at the end of 3 monthsof the trial, and 6 weeks after the end of trial. The results showed thatthe rate of learning was unaffected, but there was a decrease in therate of forgetting newly learned matter. 27 In a single-blind trial, 40 children aged between 6 and 8 years were divided into two groups. One group of 20 children were given 1.05 gBacopa monnieri drug made into syrup (1 teaspoon containing equiv- alent of 350 mg Bacopa monnieri ) thrice a day for 3 months, whereas the other group received placebo syrup. At the end of the treatmentperiod, there was improvement in immediate memory and percep-tion, and in the children's general performance. 28 In a study to test the safety and tolerability of Bacosides A and B, no side effects were seen, and the drug was well tolerated.24Further the ef- fect of acute25and chronic26administration (12 weeks) of 300 mg of Bacopa monnieri extract on cognitive function in healthy volunteers was studied in a double-blind placebo-controlled manner. Adverse ef-fects in the chronic study were not very different from placebo, only agreater percentage in the Bacopa monniera group reported dry mouth, nausea, and fatigue. 26 Centella asiatica Urban (Linn.) (Family: Apiaceae) The use of Centella asiatica (see Plate 8 in color gallery) in chronic venous insufficiency is covered in Chapter 6, \"Cardiovascular drugs\"and for wound healing in Chapter 9, \"Dermatological agents.\" How - ever, the herb is best known in India as a medhya rasayana or mental rejuvenator, which improves memory and retention. Medhya rasayana reduce the negative impact of stress by their mild tranquilizing actionand by improving memory span and \"intelligence.\" 29The plant is also considered a rejuvenator or rasayana helping to maintain youthful vigor and vitality. It is used in the treatment of epilepsy, senility, andpremature aging. 30The leaves and the plant have been used for this pur - pose for a very long time, often taken in food in the form of spicedCentral Nervous System Agents 283paste of the leaves known as chutneys, in salads, or as tea to improve vigor, and as a brain tonic. Interestingly, it is given to children learningtheVedas inVeda Patashalas, 31or the traditional schools, where the Vedas are taught in the traditional manner of memorizing the vast num - ber of Vedic verses solely by loud repetition and memorization. It is also a favorite, nowadays, with school children as examinationsapproach, to help in building memory and retaining the studied mate - r i a l .I ti sa no f f i c i a ld r u gi nt h e Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia, 2002, as a brain tonic and sedative. 32 As with other medhya drugs, the first experimental studies investi - gated the sedative and antianxiety effects of the herb; since a calmmind helped in learning. Thus, the saponin fraction containingbrahmoside and brahminoside was shown in rats to act as a mild tran-quilizer. 33Several extracts, including the alcoholic34-36and aqueous of barbiturate or phenobarbitone hypno-sis. 34An experimental study in rats on the effect of 100 mg per 100 g body weight of an alcoholic extract of Centella asiatica on various neurotransmitters showed decreased levels of acetylcholine and in-creased levels of histamine and catecholamines, relative to a controlgroup, suggesting that this may contribute to the antianxiety effect seenclinically. 36In addition, the alcoholic extract showed a dose-dependent increase in gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) levels in rats that wasblocked by the specific GABA Ablocker\u2014bicuculline methiodide.37In vitro Centella asiatica has shown affinity for GABABreceptor, which may contribute to memory enhancement.38The aqueous extract of Centella asiatica (25 mg\u00b7kg/H110021i.p.) showed, in small animals, an anti - anxiety effect comparable to diazepam39and the alcoholic extract in- jected intraperitoneally showed a mild sedative effect.40 An experimental study on the effect of an aqueous extract of fresh Centella asiatica leaf was studied in small animals (albino rats) using a two-compartment passive avoidance task. In drug-treated animals, therewas a significant improvement in 24-hour retention when compared tocontrols treated with saline. A study of the levels of central neuro - transmitters norepinephrine, dopamine, and 5-hydroxytryptamine andtheir metabolites showed a significant decrease in the drug-treated groupsuggesting that these neurotransmitters help in the learning process mainly through inhibition. In addition, there is a decrease in the urinary284 AYURVEDIC HERBSlevel of antioxidant activity.42,43The aqueous extract has also been shown to reduce the amnesic effects of pentylenetetrazole.44In an animal model for Alzheimer's disease, the aqueous extract of Centel - la asiatica was able to prevent cognitive deficits and oxidative stress.45 In a double-blind placebo-controlled study, 30 mentally retarded children were administered 0.5 g per day of the plant powder for12 weeks. There was significant improvement in the general abilityof the children and also in their behavioral pattern. 46In a 6-month, double-blind trial in 30 mentally retarded children aged between7 and 18 years given one 500 mg tablet of Centella asiatica (part not mentioned, probably whole plant powder as used by the same group in other trials) daily for 6 months, there was a significant increase in the general mental ability, overall adjustment, and mental concentra-tion seen at the end of 6 months. This improvement in general behav-ior was maintained up to 1 year after withdrawal of the drug. 47In a double-blind study, 57 normal children with an IQ between 90 and110 were given 0.5 g of the plant powder for 1 year. There were 14dropouts and data from 43 children was evaluated. It was found that there was no significant improvement in the intelligence quotient. 48 In another open trial with 12 educable, mentally retarded children, in the age group of 8-12 years, were given 100 mg\u00b7kg/H110021body weight of powder of Centella asiatica in two divided doses for 6 months and followed up for 1 year. Posttreatment values on Malin's Intelligence scale for Indian Children (MISIC), Bender's Gestalt Test, and Raven Matrices showed modifications at various mental levels. There was a very significant improvement in the academic performance of eightchildren. 49 In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial to test the anxiolytic activity, subjects were randomly assigned to receive either a single dose of 12 g ofCentella asiatica (n= 20) or placebo ( n= 20), and the acoustic startle re - sponse (ASR) was tested 30 and 60 minutes after the treatment whenCentella asiatica was found to attenuate the ASR, suggesting that it has an anxiolytic effect. 50 Further clinical studies are needed to fully delineate the usefulness of this very promising plant and also to establish its effect on otherCentral Nervous System Agents 285body systems and side-effect profile. The plant is generally consid - ered safe and is commonly used in food. However, it is traditionally consumed only in moderate amounts; larger amounts are consideredto cause headache and dizziness. 51There are also reports of photosensitivity when consumed. In animal experiments on mice nomortality was observed up to 5 g\u00b7kg /H110021. The alcoholic extract was found nontoxic up Black Climbing Staff T ree, Intellect T ree Celastrus paniculatus is a large, woody climber bearing yellow fruits found growing almost all over India up to 1,800 m. The fruits arecapsules containing 3-6 seeds with an unpleasant odor and taste, en-closed in a red aril. The seed oil, known as Celastrus oil or malkanguni oil varies in color depending upon the method of processing: pale yel-low\u2014on cold expression, dark brown\u2014when obtained by extractionwith hexane, or black\u2014if heat is used in the extraction process. 53,54In Ayurveda, the seeds and seed oil of Celastrus paniculatus are most commonly used in mental disorders and are considered to enhancememory and comprehension. 54The fruits, including the seeds, have an official status in the Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia, 2002, as a tran - quilizer.55 The seed contains 42-45 percent of fatty oil consisting of palmitic, oleic, linolenic acids and their glycerol esters. - ent in minor amounts whichmalkangunin is the major sedative and tran - quilizing action56,57of the seed oil. The effects of the seed extract on the brain of albino rats have been studied58and found to significantly increase the number of lipids and phospholipids in the brain. Rats fedwith 1 ml of 5 percent seed oil emulsion for 3-7 days showed im - proved learning and memory. 59,60In another experimental model in - volving a two-compartment avoidance task, albino rats that were fed286 AYURVEDIC HERBSseed oil showed improved cognitive ability compared to saline con - trols and decreased levels of norepinephrine, dopamine, and seroto - nin, and their metabolites in the brain and in urine suggesting that these aminergic systems are involved in the memory and learningprocess. 61Seed oil 50-400 mg\u00b7kg/H110021for 14 days was able to prevent amnesic effect of scopolamine in navigational memory performancein rats. 62Both the methanol extract of the herb63and the aqueous extract of the seed64,65showed significant protective effect against free radical damage suggesting that the antioxidant activity may be responsible forits cognitive-enhancing properties and also could offer protectionagainst a host of neurodegenerative diseases. In an animal model ofAlzheimer's disease, aqueous extract of Celastrus paniculatus ICV streptozotocin-caused cognitive im- pairment. 66 The seed oil is widely used in psychiatric practice with promising results.67A recent study reported the use of Celastrus paniculatus in depressive illness. In a controlled clinical study 55 patients with de- pression were divided into three groups\u2014group A (24 patients) re-ceived two 500 mg tablets of Jyotishmati (made from leaves and small stems) thrice daily for 6 weeks, group B (18 patients) receivedthe same dose of Jyotishmati in addition to modern treatment (not specified), while group C (13 patients) received placebo. There wasstatistically significant reduction of symptoms such as sadness, lackof interest, insomnia and psychomotor retardation, and a significantreduction in the degree of depression based on HDRS (Hamilton De - pression Rating Scale) in both the treatment groups with respect toplacebo, with an additive effect in group B. Similar dropout rates were seen (group A\u20146, B\u20144, and C\u20144). 68However, an early dou - ble-blind study in mentally deficient patients showed that the seedshad no effect on learning. 69In mentally retarded children chronic treatment with Celastrus paniculatus oil produced improvement in IQ scores and decreased the content of catecholamine metabolites.70 Products from Celastrus paniculatus are reported to have low toxic - ity. However larger doses can cause burning of the skin.71In an acute toxicity study the seed oil was given in doses from 0.5 to 5 g\u00b7kg/H110021body weight to rats. No toxic manifestation, behavioral changes, and mortal - ity were seen even at the highest dose. In a rotorod test, rats given theCentral Nervous System Agents 287seed oil could stay on the rotorod for more than 3 minutes showing no loss of motor coordination. Thus Celastrus oil does not have small, diffuse herb covered with white hairs and bearing white or pale pink flowers from mid-winter to mid- spring found throughout India in the hotter regions.72Like other plants dealt with in this chapter, this plant is also a medhya rasayana drug or mental rejuvenator. It was considered by Caraka to be one of the best in this category of mental rejuvenators;73however, it has not been scientifically investigated to any great Several plant, in addition to the ubiquitous sterol\u2014/H9252 -sitosterol. 74 The whole plant is used as the drug. In small animals, Convolvulus pluricaulis h a sb e e ns h o w nt oh a v e tranquilizing activity.75,76The alcoholic extract of the plant and various fractions derived from it have also been shown to have potentiate bar - biturate hypnosis77, 78using diazepam as a standard; maximum activity being seen in the water-soluble portion of the chloroform extract78and exhibited by the leaves and flowers,79especially in the spring when the flowering is at its peak.80The activity in the barbiturate hypnosis was better than Centella asiatica.81The effect of the drug was also tested on the levels of acetylcholine, catecholamine, serotonin, and histamine in normal and stressed rats, and found to act as a tranquilizer, also en - hancing cognitive function.82In addition, feeding of Convolvulus pluricaulis increased protein synthesis in the hippocampus83and also influenced GABA levels in the brain tissue and blood.84Furthermore,288 AYURVEDIC HERBSthe ethanolic extract showed some degree of antioxidant activity, which was not significant.85 In an open trial on 30 patients with anxiety neurosis, the drug was given daily in the form of a syrup in 30 ml of divided doses, each dosecorresponding to 10 g of crude drug, for a period of 1 month. Patientsshowed significant symptomatic relief\u2014reduction in anxiety levels,increased work output, decreased stress hormone levels, and loweredblood pressure and pulse rate\u2014apart from a significant reduction inmental fatigue rate after 1 month of therapy. 86 More scientific work on the chemical, pharmacological, and clinical aspects is required to understand the high esteem in which it was held byCaraka. At this point it may be pertinent to mention that this plant is oneof the controversial drugs in Ayurveda and there are discussions as to theidentity of this plant, although it has been generally agreed upon byscholars that Convolvulus pluricaulis is the accepted source of the drug. Withania somnifera Dunal. (Family: Solanaceae) Other aspects of the use of Withania somnifera have been covered in Chapter 8, \"Antirheumatic agents.\" There are several chemotypes ofthe plant available with varying amounts of the various sitoindosides.The roots have been considered an important mental rejuvenator(medhya rasayana) in Ayurveda for 3,000 years, and as being useful in the treatment of various nervous disorders, in improving memory,and being helpful in conditions such as epilepsy and insanity. Thedrug also helps in the rejuvenation of the nervous system and protectsit against environmental influences, improves cognitive deficits dueto age, stress, or drugs, and builds nonspecific host defense. 87 The alcoholic extract of Withania somnifera root showed sedative effects VII-X and Withaferin A preparedby combination of equimolar amounts of the compounds taken fromWithania somnifera induced an increase in the cortical muscarinic ace - tylcholine capacity, which may partly explain the cognition-enhancingCentral Nervous System Agents 289effects seen both in animals and humans.90The bioactive withanolides, as a defined mixture described above, administered orally once daily to rats in a dose of 20 and 50 mg\u00b7kg/H110021for 5 days showed an anxiolytic ef - fect comparable to 0.5 mg\u00b7kg/H110021lorazepam given intraperitoneally and an antidepressant effect comparable to imipramine (10 mg\u00b7kg/H110021,i p ) .87 This same mixture of sitoindosides and withaferin A when given orally to rats at 20-50 mg\u00b7kg/H110021in an experimental model of Alzheimer's dis - ease was found at 50 mg\u00b7kg/H110021to significantly reverse amnesic effect of ibotenic acid and reduce cholinergic markers after 2 weeks of treat - ment,91in addition to demonstrating free-radical scavenging activity and antioxidant activity in chronic footshock-induced stress.92Withania somnifera extract at 50, 100, and 200 mg\u00b7kg/H110021h a sa l s ob e e ns h o w nt o improve retention in a passive avoidance task in a stepdown test, andalso shown to significantly reverse amnesic effects of scopolamine (0.3mg\u00b7kg /H110021). In another experiment, the amnesic effect of electric shock treatment was significantly reversed by daily administration of Withania somnifera extract for 6 days.93Sitoindosides IX and X have been shown in a stepdown test to improve both short- and long-term mem-ory in mice after oral intake. 94In addition, the methanol extract of Withania somnifera has been shown to promote formation of dendrites in human neuroblastoma cells;95more specifically the axons were ex- tended by withanolide A and dendrites by withanosides IV and VI.96 These compound plus a few other similar ones have also displayed sig-nificant neurite outgrowth at 1 \u00b5M concentration in human neuro- blastoma cell line. 97In addition, a different extract significantly re- duced degenerating cells in the hippocampal region of stressed rats.98 Thus, although there is considerable experimental evidence for thepossible cognitive-enhancing effects of Withania somnifera, there is very little clinical evidence in the form of formal trials, only a singletrial in patients of anxiety neurosis is available. However, the drug isextensively used in Ayurveda both as a single drug, and in combina - tion, for various nervous conditions, and needs to be clinically studied. In an open trial, 30 patients of anxiety neurosis were administered 40 ml of an alcoholic extract of ashwagandha in the form known in Ayurveda as arista, which is obtained by extraction of the roots of Withania somnifera by self-generated alcohol to yield an extract con - taining 15 percent alcohol; 40 ml of preparation corresponds to 12 g290 AYURVEDIC HERBSof dried roots. This preparation was given in divided doses for 1 month and patients were evaluated every week for clinical symptoms suchas nervousness, palpitation, tremors, headache, anorexia, insomnia,lack of concentration, dyspepsia, fatigue, and irritability. In addition,various psychological tests were conducted to determine anxiety lev - els, adjustment level, mental fatigue, and immediate memory span and biochemical determination of stress hormones. After 1 month oftreatment there was significant decrease in intensity of symptoms,maximum improvement being seen in nervousness scores. Mental fa - tigue rate was significantly reduced, assessed in terms of fewer mis - takes committed and greater work output after 1 month of treatment.The immediate memory span also increased significantly. Other changes included increased body weight and breath-holding time. In addition, there was reduced urinary excretion of cortisol and cate-cholamines. There was no change in blood pressure and respirationrate. 99 In a double-blind placebo-controlled study, the effect of Withania somnifera on psychomotor performance of healthy men and women was compared with Panax ginseng. V olunteers were divided into three groups. Group 1 received standardized ginseng extract, group 2volunteers were given 250 mg Withania somnifera root powder twice a day for 40 days, and group 3 was given lactose in capsules as pla-cebo. At the end of the treatment period, volunteers on Withania somnifera were tested and found to perform better in tasks involving logical thinking, problem solving, and reaction time than the groupreceiving Panax ginseng. 100 Information on the safety of Withania somnifera has been covered in Chapter 8, 1.

PARKINSON'S DISEASE Parkinson's disease (paralysis agitans) is a degenerative neurolog - ical disorder causing muscle tremor, stiffness, weakness, and diffi- culty with balance and in walking. Paralysis agitans has been de-scribed in Ayurveda as kampavata (kampa, shaking or tremor; vata is the principle or humor responsible for all movements). Multiplant preparations containing Mucuna pruriens as the source of levodopa are used in Ayurveda for the treatment of kampavata. 1 Mucuna pruriens Baker 12 in color gallery) is an herbaceous climber found growing all over India. The pods are covered with highly irritant hairs causing intense itching\u2014the plant is named afterthis. Inside the pod are 4-6 black seeds, which are used medicinally.The seeds are well known in Ayurveda as an aphrodisiac agent andare also used as an anthelmintic agent, as a nerve tonic, for urinarydisorders, and for fertility problems. In times of scarcity, the seedsare also used as food after repeatedly boiling and discarding the re - sultant liquid. 2,3 The seeds contain up to 4-6 percent of L-DOPA - l-3,4-dihy - 5.28298 HERBSpercent percent of a fatty oil. 2,3 The clinical study of Mucuna pruriens seeds for the treatment of Parkinson's disease6preceded pharmacological studies. Subsequent pharmacological studies in small animals showed that the efficacy ofthe seed powder against Parkinson's disease was devoid of anycholinergic effect. 7The anti-Parkinsonian activity of the seed powder was due not only to the content of L-DOPA but also due to other com - ponents,8-10as seen in the activity exhibited in other fractions free from L-DOPA.8Comparison of the CNS profiles of 100 mg\u00b7kg/H110021of L-DOPA and 3 g of seed powder of Mucuna pruriens containing 100 mg of L-DOPA showed similar activity as regards the dopaminergicpathway in showing an equivalent hypothermic and anti-Parkin-sonian activity in rats and mice; however, in other aspects seed pow-der of Mucuna pruriens showed a better tolerability and improved anti-Parkinsonian activity due to the presence of other components 5,10 or adjuvants, which improve the activity of L-DOPA.5In addition, the alcoholic extract of the seeds has potent antioxidant activity.11The pha- rmacokinetic profile of a formulation from Mucuna pruriens seed known as HP-200 has been studied and found to be similar to formu-lations of synthetic L-DOPA. 12 In a trial to assess the efficacy, tolerability, and acceptability of Mucuna pruriens in Parkinson's disease patients,6there was a wash - out period of 6 weeks, after which the seed powder was given in adose of 15-40 g to 23 patients in divided doses, which was graduallyincreased until patients were receiving about 40-50 g of powder perday for an average treatment period of 20 weeks up to a maximum of15 g four times a day. Baseline values of the patients compared withthe final values showed an overall reduction in the morbidity index.Physical signs and handwriting records showed improvement. Theseed powder was well tolerated; however, some patients sought areduction in bulk. However, this bulk was useful in reducing constipa - tion in patients. Side effects were few\u2014dose dependent and mild\u2014 andimproved on dose adjustment. These included giddiness, sweating,flatulence, diarrhea of mild nature, and dry mouth and blue-blackCentral Nervous System Agents 299urine in one patient of moderate intensity. Bioavailability studies with Mucuna pruriens showed significant absorption of L-DOPA from the seed powder.6 In another open multicentric study, 60 patients with Parkinson's disease were treated for 12 weeks with HP-200 derived fromendocarp of Mucuna pruriens to assess its efficacy and tolerability. Twenty-six of the patients had earlier been on synthetic levodopa/carbidopa combination, whereas the remaining 36 were on levodopaalone, which was discontinued before inclusion in the study. Thedrug prepared from the endocarp of Mucuna pruriens was supplied in sachets containing 33.33 mg of levodopa per sachet. Patients were as-sessed on the United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale taken beforethe start of the trial and at the end of 12 weeks. Each patient got an av-erage of 6\u00b13 sachets daily. There was statistically significant im-provement in symptoms seen in patients. Side effects were mild, seeninfrequently, and were gastrointestinal in nature. 13 Safety studies carried out on rats and mice have established the product as safe with no abnormalities in blood chemistry, liver andkidney observed, and no gross or histological abnormalities of brainand vital organs. 14A long-term study, 52 weeks, of the effect of ad- ministration of the endocarp of Mucuna pruriens to rats found it not to exert any significant alteration on the levels of the monoaminergicneurotransmitters or cause stereotypic behavior. 9 NOTES 1.

SEDATIVE PLANTS Sedative plants are used to calm the mind. \" Svapnajannan \" is the an erect herb found growing in the Al - pine Himalayas at an elevation of 3,000-5,000 m. The rhizome, cov - ered with fine reddish brown fibrous tufts stemming from the leftoverCentral Nervous System Agents 301petioles of radical leaves, is used medicinally. The drug is known since the time of Caraka and has been recommended very often byCaraka, Sushruta, and V agbhata for nervous disorders, as a sedative, and as a tranquilizer; 2however, it has not been much investigated. The rhizome is an official drug in the Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia, 2002, as a sedative.3 The rhizome contains approximately 2 percent of a bitter aro - matic essential oil, from which jatamansone has been isolated in0.02-0.1 percent yields and found identical to valeranone fromValeriana officinalis. 3,40Other components include jatamansic acid, terpenic coumarins,lignans, and neolignans. 3 Extracts of the rhizome have shown a sedative effect in small ani- mals.5,6Jatamansone has been shown to have a tranquilizing effect in experimental animals.7Alcoholic extract of the rhizomes cause an overall increase in central monoamines and inhibitory monoamines.8 Nardostachys jatamansi shows a protective effect in focal ischemia, probably due to its antioxidant activity,9the petroleum ether extract ofNardostachys jatamansi having been shown to exhibit a dose- dependent antioxidant property.10 In an open exploratory study, 24 medical students were given a dose of 60 g of the root powder of Nardostachys jatamansi to study its sedative action. There was a prolongation of visual reaction time,the action being observed within an hour of intake, reaching a peakafter 3 hours and lasting for 5 hours. 11 In a trial on pregnant women, 6 g of Nardostachys jatamansi powder was given in two divided doses, and the women were ob - served in the 25-26th week, 33-34th week, and just before the onsetof labor. The trial group women showed reduced anxiety levels andduration of labor, increased baby weight, and an increased crownand rump length in comparison to the control group, who did not re - ceive the medication. The authors conclude that the better growth ofthe fetus may be due to the anxiolytic effect leading to better uterinecirculation. 12 The LD50of jatamansone (valeranone) in rats and mice orally was found to be greater than is a short, hairy herb found growing in the tem - perate Himalayas. Caraka describes the use of the rhizome in Ayurveda; however, its use in CNS disorders is mentioned in laterbooks such as the Dhanvantari Nighantu andBhavaprakash. 14In Ayurveda, it is used in delirium, insomnia, epilepsy, and in behavioraldisorders. 14Most of the scientific information with regard to Indian Valerian is in comparison with Valeriana officinalis. The rhizomes of V . wallichii have a higher percentage of 3-6 to Valeriana clas- sified as a scientific studies of three Valeriana species\u2014 V . officinalis from Europe, V . edulis Mex- ico, and V .wallichii from India is available.15 NOTES 1.

The term rasayana in Ayurveda is mentioned way back in the Caraka Samhita as an agent that confers long life, youthfulness, free- dom from disease, a strong body, maintenance of faculties leading to a gleaming complexion, powerful voice, good eyesight, acuity ofmental faculties, and acute hearing\u2014in effect retaining one's facul-ties throughout one's life. 1With such an enticing prospect, it is little wonder that this concept has aroused great interest in interpretingthese outcomes in modern scientific terms. Studies have shown that some of these effects can be explained in terms of antioxidant activity 2protecting the body against free radical damage, stimulation of the immune system, thus protecting the bodyagainst infections by increasing host defense, 3,4and adaptogenic ac- tivity protecting the body against the ill effects of stress, such as envi - ronmental conditions.3,5It has also been shown that these rasayana plants exhibit organ specificity, as mentioned in Ayurveda.3For ex - ample, there is the whole series of drugs known as medhya that are considered to help in enhancing memory, intellect, and retention,covered in Chapter 12. Other herbs such as Tinospora cordifolia are recommended for the liver, Emblica officinalis for the pancreas, As- paragus racemosus for the stomach, and Piper longum for the lungs. 3 \u00a9 2006 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

According to Caraka, rasayanas are drugs that vitalize cells, thereby opening up partially or fully blocked channels (srotas). Many of the rasayanas have been shown to act as free radical scavengers exhibiting antioxidant activity withthe potential to mitigate the effects of aging. Thus, just as antioxi-dants are taken as dietary supplements, rasayanas can be used both for prophylactic and therapeutic use to prevent free radical damage. 1 However, in earlier trials, modern markers of antioxidant activitywere not of Emblica officinalis (see Plate 1 in color gallery) are one of the best-known rasayana drugs in Ayurveda, promoting health and youthfulness, protecting the heart and the body, and bestowing, on oral intake, freedom from disease. However, the antiaging, or306 AYURVEDIC HERBSrasayana, aspect has not been much investigated in the clinic, with only a few of reports of its usefulness. The fruits are very widely con - sumed in the form of a confection made out of the fruits and several other herbs and taken as a multiherbal preparation known as Chyavan - prash named after the sage Chyavan, who used it for rejuvenation. In order to make it available at home throughout the year the fruit ismade into jam, pickles, the whole fruit preserved in honey, or itspieces sun-dried to add, when required, into food items. Aging has been considered to result from free radical damage, and agents displaying the antioxidant effect protect the body and mindfrom aging. Fruits of Emblica officinalis exhibit a potent antioxidant effect, 2,3which was first attributed to the high content of Vitamin C (600-900 mg per 10 g of fresh fruit).4Later experiments have sug- gested that the fruits are devoid of Vitamin C.5The antioxidant activity has been postulated to arise from the tannins emblicanin A and B,punigluconin, and pedunculagin, 6w h i c hh a v eb e e ns h o w nt op r o t e c t the heart7and the brain8from oxidative stress, rather than Vitamin C. The extract of Emblica officinalis exhibits an adaptogenic ef- fect and protects experimental animals from a variety of stresses\u2014physical, chemical, and biological, 9whereas the fresh fruit homoge- nate on chronic administration protected the heart against oxidativestress. 10Flavonoids from Emblica officinalis, apart from their potent hypolipidemic and hypoglycemic effects, also improve the blood pic-ture by raising hemoglobin levels. 11 Thus, there is evidence from experimental studies that the fruits are potent antioxidants, with favorable effects on several organ sys- tems; however, evidence from clinical trials is scanty. In an early ex - perimental study in rabbits, there was improvement in body weight and total serum protein content.12 In studies carried out at Varanasi, the preparation obtained from fruits of Emblica officinalis triturated 21 times with the fresh juice of the fruit and then dried and powdered, which is known as Amalaki rasayan. There was increase in body weight in clinical cases, positive nitrogen balance, increased serum mucopolysaccharides, and a de - creased excretion of turnover, repair,and regeneration of connective tissues. 13Rasayana Drugs 307In another study, patients undergoing surgery for inguinal hernia and senile enlargement of prostate in the age group of 55-60 years were g i v e n1 0go fAmalaki rasayan in three divided doses for 10 days prior to surgery. Treatment was evaluated on the basis of time taken for am - bulation, early return of physiological functions such as passage of fla - tus, and changes in serum mucopolysaccharides, hydroxyproline, uri - nary nitrogen, blood picture, and blood sugar levels against the timetaken by patients maintained as control. Patients treated with Amalaki rasayan did not show any loss of body weight, had improved hemato - logical picture, were ambulatory earlier, and had early return of physi - ological functions. In addition, biochemical parameters also indicated a favorable return of connective tissue turnover. 14The safety of Emblica officinalis is covered in Chapter 3, \"Gastrointestinal agents.\" This promising fruit needs to somnifera Dunal. (Family: Solanaceae) 8, \"Antirheumatic agents\" and in Chapter 12 \"Central nervous system agents.\" The roots are considered to have a health-promoting effect, improving stamina, warding off disease, and toning up the body and mind. In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial, Withania somnifera h a sb e e ns h o w nt oi m p r o v e the health of adult volunteers over a period of 1 year. It has also beenused in children to improve health. Studies in small animals have shown that Withania somnifera exerts an adaptogenic effect against a variety of physical 15-17biological,16and chemical stressors,16and in a chronic stress model.18There was signifi - cant increase in the physical working capacity and an increase in theheart weight and glycogen content of the myocardium and liver. 17 Adaptogenic activity has also been shown in a withanolide-free sitoindosides VII-X and withaferin been shown to exhibit antioxidant activ - ity.Withania somnifera has also been shown to exhibit immuno - stimulatory activity with significant increase in hemoglobin concentra - tion, red blood cell count, white blood cell count, platelet count, and308 AYURVEDIC HERBSbody weight as compared to untreated control in different animal mod - els of myelosupression.25Increased synthesis of nitric oxide by macrophages has been postulated to partly explain the immuno - stimulatory activity of Withania somnifera.26 In a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical to study the ef - fect of Withania somnifera on normal healthy male volunteers in the age group 50-59 years, powdered root of Withania somnifera made into 500 mg tablets or a similar tablets made of starch, which was matched as far as possible for color, strength, and appearance, wasgiven. A total of 331 volunteers were screened and 141 subjects, who did not have diseases such as diabetes, asthma, CHD, hypertension etc. were included in the trial and randomly allocated to receive thedrug or placebo, two tablets thrice daily with milk for 1 year; 101 vol-unteers completed the treatment. There was significant increase inhemoglobin and red blood corpuscles in the treated group. Other sig-nificant changes included an increase in seated stature, increase inhair melanin content, reduced decrease in nail calcium, greater de-crease in serum cholesterol, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in thetreated group as compared to placebo. Approximately 71 percent ofvolunteers reported subjective improvement in sexual performance.No side effects were seen. 27 In another double-blind study conducted on normal male and fe- male children, ages 8-12 years, the effect of Withania was compared with Withania somnifera andBoerhaavia diffusa, ferrous fumarate at two different concentrations and placebo in differentgroups along with milk for 60 days. Thus, group 1 received 2 g\u00b7day /H110021 ofWithania somnifera, group 2 received 2 1:1 mixture of Withania somnifera andBoerhaavia diffusa, group 3 received 2 g lac - tose mixed with 5 mg of ferrous fumarate, group 4 received 2 g lac - tose mixed with 30 mg of ferrous fumarate, whereas group 5 received2 g lactose powder, all medications with 100 ml of milk. All the chil - dren received similar diet and had similar environmental conditionssince they were inmates of a local orphanage. Baseline values wereestimated before the start of the trial. It was found that there was in - crease in body weight and a significant increase in mean corpuscularhemoglobin and total protein over the initial level in group 1 onashwagandha, in comparison to placebo. In group 2, receiving a 1:1Rasayana Drugs 309mixture of ashwagandha and punarnava, although there was in - crease over initial values in several parameters such as hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, serumiron, and hand grip, only hemoglobin and hand grip differed signifi - cantly from placebo. In children in group 4 receiving 5 mg ferrousfumarate and those in group 5 receiving placebo, there was no signifi - cant change in any of the parameters studied, whereas in group 3 re - ceiving 30 mg ferrous fumarate, there was significant increase in he - moglobin, corpuscular hemoglobin, serum iron, and in hand gripcompared to the placebo group. The results in group 1 and 2 led theauthors to recommend fortifying milk with the Withania somnifera andBoerhaavia diffusa to improve growth and strength in growing children and increasing the quantity of Withania somnifera in the combination in order to take advantage of the hematinic properties ofWithania somnifera, pointing out that the quantity of iron in ashwagandha is equal to that in 5 mg of ferrous fumarate. 28 In another study, Withania somnifera andTinospora cordifolia were administered to separate groups of patients for 3 months tostudy potential antiaging effects, better results were achieved withTinospora cordifolia. However, this study has been published in the form of an abstract and hence further details are not available. 29 Considering the importance of the results obtained and the ad- vances in analytical methodology it is worthwhile laying down thespecifications for the material to be used, which are then followed byfurther trials with larger numbers of volunteers to confirm the resultsobtained in these studies.

IMMUNOSTIMULANT EFFECTS AGAINST INFECTION Plants used as rasayanas have the potential to promote health by strengthening host defense against different diseases rather than spe- cific action on the disease. This can be seen in the examples that fol-low and also in Chapter 4 where Tinospora cordifolia was used as an adjuvant to antibiotics following surgery for obstructive jaundice. Plate 4 in color gallery) in ob- structive jaundice has been covered in section, \"Hepatoprotectiveagents\" in Chapter 4 and also as an anti-inflammatory agent in Chap - ter 8, \"Antirheumatic agents.\" There has been a considerable amountof work on the immunomodulatory activity of the plant, severalimmunostimulating compounds having been isolated. Syringin andcordiol show anticomplementary activity, increase IgG antibodies,and increase humoral immunity in a dose-depend - ent manner. Cordioside, cordifolioside A, and cordiol show macro - phage immunologically active arabinogalactan isolated shown possess antioxidant metastasis.5Rasayana Drugs 313Tuberculosis Tinospora cordifolia is considered a rasayana, which protects against infection. It has been shown in a series of experiments upon small animals to be a powerful immunostimulant, which increaseshost defense both in normal and in immunocompromised states 1 through activation of the immune cells such as the macrophages, andespecially the peritoneal and alveolar macrophages. 6The macrophage function in rats by Tinospora cordifolia has been studied both by itself and in combination with modern anti-tubercular (anti-TB) drugs and then compared with that produced bystandard anti-tubercular drugs. 7The studies have shown that the phagocytic and intracellular killing capacity of the alveolarmacrophages has been increased through stimulation of nitric oxide(NO) synthesis in alveolar macrophages by Tinospora cordifolia, significantly anti-TB drugs. cordifolia was coadministered with anti-TB drugs the de- crease of NO production was prevented. 8 In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial the effect of coadmini- stration of either mg thrice daily of Tinospora cordifolia or pla- cebo along with standard anti-TB drugs was evaluated in 31 patients,and these patients were assessed early on in the first 2 months oftreatment. At the end of 2 months, the data available for 20 patientsshows that addition of Tinospora cordifolia produced a number of useful effects and lowered composite clinical score faster than pla - cebo. The patients gained weight, had reduced sputum conversion time, had improved radiological picture, and had an improved quality of life with fewer side effects and dropouts. 8The effect of coadmini - stration of Tinospora cordifolia (500 mg thrice a day) against placebo was also evaluated in TB patients on a short-term anti-TB regime for6 months, and in a larger number of patients (24 on Tinospora cordifolia and 22 on placebo) confirmed results obtained earlier. At 6 months there was no significant difference between placebo andTinospora cordifolia. There were fewer adverse effects reported and fewer dropouts in the Tinospora cordifolia group. 9 Thus, adding Tinospora cordifolia (TC) to anti-TB drugs seems to hasten recovery and improve quality of life at the end of 2 months;314 AYURVEDIC HERBShowever, at the end of 6 months the differences seem to have evened out.8,9Thus in a double-blind placebo-controlled study with 50 pa - tients\u201423 on TC and 27 on placebo\u201447 percent of the placebogroup showed improvement, whereas 75 percent of the TC groupshowed progress including radiological improvement. In addition,there were fewer side effects in the TC-treated group (15 percent) ascompared to placebo (40 percent) at the end of 2 months. 6 Asthma In ten chronic asthmatics treated with one 500 mg tablet of Tinospora cordifolia aqueous extract thrice daily for 8 weeks there was considerable improvement in the quality of life, reduced fre - quency of asthmatic attacks, and decrease in severity of symptoms,such as coughing and wheezing. 10 The safety of Tinospora cordifolia is covered in Chapter 4, \"Hepatoprotective agents.\" NOTES 1.

IMMUNOSTIMULANT See also Chapter tract drugs\" asiatica (see Plate 8 in color gallery) is a small creeping herb found growing throughout India near water bodies. It is tradi- tionally used in Ayurveda for a number of conditions includingcough, bronchitis, and asthma, 1and is considered an antiaging herb that fortifies the immune system.2See also Chapters 6, 9, and 12. The alcoholic extract of Centella asiatica has been shown to have a stimulatory effect on the reticuloendothelial system in mice.3In addi- tion, the aqueous extract has been shown to have a positive effect onthe complement system. 4Rats fed orally with 100 mg\u00b7kg/H110021body weight per day of aqueous suspension of Centella asiatica for 7 days showed an immunostimulant activity, which was assessed to be com-parable to 60 percent that of interferon alpha2b. 5 Treatment for 1 month of aged persons with Centella asiatica was found to give significant relief in common ailments, such as cold, cough,and bronchitis. There was significant increase in serum IgM ( p< 0.01) and IgG (p < 0.05) levels indicating a general increase in immunity. 6 The safety of Centella asiatica is covered in Chapter 6, \"Cardiovas - cular drugs\" and in Chapter 12, \"Central nervous system agents.\" NOTES 1.

CANCER THERAPY Cancer is a malignant growth, or tumor, formed by abnormal, rapid reproduction of cells. In Ayurveda, a number of predisposing factors have been enunciated as a result of which a tumor can de-velop\u2014imbalance in the humors (doshas) , poor digestion, and ab- sorption leading to formation of undigested food particles, depositionin the tissues, and enzyme malfunction that result in a tumor develop-ment. 1From a list of 100 plants used traditionally for the treatment of cancer, 44 have been postulated as having anticancer activity. Otherauthors have arrived at similar figures of active plants. 2,3Although there has been substantial pharmacological work, the clinical work isminiscule and mostly as adjuvants Boswellia serrata in color gallery) resin has been cov - ered in Chapter 3, \"Gastrointestinal agents,\" in Chapter 5, \"Respiratory tract drugs,\" and in Chapter 8, \"Antirheumatic agents,\" where its use asan anti-inflammatory agent has been covered in a variety of conditionswhere leukotrienes play a key role in causation and in the persistenceof the disease. Traditionally, the gum is reported to be useful in ulcers,tumors, goiter, cystic breast, diarrhea, dysentery, piles, and skin dis -Rasayana Drugs 317eases.4The nonphenolic portion of the gum resin has been reported to possess antitumor, analgesic, and sedative activity.4 The 50-percent alcoholic extract of the root, fruit, and stem showed anticancer activity against several cancer screens\u2014human epidermal carcinoma of the nasopharynx in tissue culture, lymphoidleukemia, sarcoma 180, and hepatoma 129 in mice. 5In mice trans - planted with Ehrlich ascites carcinoma and S-180 transplantabletumors, it increased longevity of mice with ascites by 24 percent andreduced tumor size of S-180 tumors by 24 percent. 6Recent in vitro studies using human cell culture lines have also shown that the resinand the boswellic acids derived from it show anticancer activityagainst various cancers, notably against leukemia and brain tumors, 7 also in colon cancer cells8and in liver cancer HepG2 cells,9due to in- duction activity.7-10In the boswellic acids showed anticancer activity appliedtopically against skin cancer in mice. 11 Boswellic acids10,12such as 3-O-acetyl-11-keto- /H9252-boswellic acid and 3-O-acetyl- /H9252-boswellic acid, and /H9252-boswellic acid have been shown to be cytotoxic to human glioma cell lines, at inhibitory con-centrations (IC 50) ranging from 20 to 40 \u00b5M.12In rats with induced tu- mors receiving different dosages of the gum resin extract, those re-ceiving the highest dosage (3 \u00d7 240 mg\u00b7kg /H110021body weight) had twice the survival time of untreated controls (p < 0.05) with significantly larger number of apoptotic tumor cells.13Acetyl boswellic acids have been shown to be catalytic inhibitors of both topoisomerase I and IIsimultaneously, which could result in enhanced antitumor efficacy. 14 Boswellia serrata extract has been shown to be more potent than pure 3-O-acetyl-11-keto- /H9252-boswellic acid in three hematological cell lines.15Acetyl-11-keto- /H9252-boswellic acid showed a potent cytotoxic activity against meningioma cells (IC502-8\u00b5M), mediated partly by inhibition of the Erk signal transduction pathway that plays an essen - tial role in signal transduction and tumorogenesis16by interfering/in - terrupting with the signals that play an important role in cell prolifer - ation and cell death of different tumors. Clinical studies carried out on peritumoral edema in brain tumors, such as astrocytoma and glioblastoma using much larger doses thanearlier used for the treatment of arthritis, bronchial asthma, and in -318 AYURVEDIC HERBSflammatory bowel diseases, have shown a reduction in the edema, but not of the tumor itself, perhaps due to the short treatment periods em - ployed. It was earlier thought that there was increased formation of leukotrienes when such tumors are present. In an open study in patients with malignant astrocytomas, there was an increased excretion of leukotrienes E4(LTE4), which decreased after surgical intervention but returned to higher values when there was a re - lapse. Treatment with three 400 mg Boswellia serrata extract tablets ad - ministered thrice a day to patients for 7 days showed again a decrease inthe levels of LTE 4in the urine.17 In an exploratory controlled study with 29 patients with malignant glioblastoma, 14 patients received 1,200 mg of Boswellia serrata ex- tract (H15) thrice daily, 9 patients received 800 mg thrice daily, and 5patients 400 mg thrice daily 7 days before operation. Only patientsreceiving the highest dose had significant reduction of the perifocaledema volume, not in tumor size after 7 days intake. 18 In another study on 12 patients with brain tumor and progressive edema, treated with 1,200 mg of Boswellia serrata extract (H15) for several months, two out of seven patients with glioblastoma and pro-gressive tumors and three out of five patients with treatment-relatedleukoencephalopathy showed reduction in the perifocal edema vol-ume. All patients of leukoencephalopathy showed improvement inclinical symptoms for many months. 19 In another study, 19 children and adolescents with intracranial tu- mors received palliative therapy with H15 for a median period of 9months with a maximum dose of 126 mg\u00b7kg /H110021body weight. All the patients had earlier been treated by conventional therapy. A total of 5out of 19 patients improved in general health, 3 out of 17 patientswith malignant tumors showed a transient improvement in neurologi - cal symptoms, 3 patients showed improved muscle strength, whereas1 cachectic patient gained weight, possibly due to the antiedematouseffect of Boswellia serrata extract. 20 In the glioblastoma trial18with increased dosages up to 1,200 mg thrice daily some patients complained of nausea and vomiting andtwo patients of skin irritation, which was reversible of stoppage.However, side effects were also not seen at 1,200 mg. 19In the trial with children no side effects were seen when they received a maxi -Rasayana Drugs 319mum dose of 126 mg\u00b7kg/H110021bodyweight.20See also Chapter 3, \"Gastro - intestinal agents\" curcumin derived from it have been extensively investigated and they display a range of useful effects. Curcuma longa has been covered in Chapter 3, \"Gastrointestinal agents\" for use in dyspepsia, in Chapter 5, \"Respiratory tract drugs\" for use inasthma, and in Chapter 8, \"Antirheumatic agents\" for use in rheumatoid arthritis. Both the crude drug extract and curcumin are antioxi - dants 21,22and exhibit a rasayana. Turmeric and curcumin display considerable potential both for the treatment and prevention of cancer in a variety of cancers and they have been exten- sively investigated for their anticancer effects in vitro and in experi- mental animals, which have been reviewed.24-27Curcumin acts on a variety of tumors by suppressing proliferation,28through down-regu- lation of transcription factors,29down-regulation of the expression of number of chemokines such as COX-2, lipoxygenase, NO syn-thase, Tumor Necrosis Factor etc., cell-surface adhesion molecules, and certain growth factors, apart from inhibition of certain kinases, which have been reviewed. 27 In an open study carried out on 111 patients, of whom the data from 62 patients with external cancerous lesions could be evaluated,both an ethanol extract of Curcuma longa containing 0.5 percent curcumin and an ointment containing 0.5 percent curcumin in whiteVaseline applied thrice daily gave patients considerable symptomaticrelief, which was considered remarkable by the authors. A reductionin smell was noted in 90 percent cases and a reduction in itching innearly all cases. Although 10 percent patients experienced a reduc - tion in lesion size and pain, 70 percent of patients had dry lesions. The effects of the drug continued for several months in many of the patients. An adverse reaction was noticed only in 1 patient who com - plained of itching from the 62 patients treated in the study. 30 In another study carried out on 16 chronic smokers whose urine showed positive for mutagens with Ames's test, treatment with 1.5 g320 AYURVEDIC HERBSofCurcuma longa for 4 weeks showed significant reduction in the mutagenic response in comparison to controls consisting of 6 non - smokers.31 Oral submucous fibrosis is commonly observed in India as a re - sult of chewing betel nut containing masticants and their exfoliated oral mucosal cells contain significantly larger number of micro - nucleated cells when compared to healthy subjects not indulging inchewing or smoking. 32In a trial on patients with submucous fibro - sis, three treatment modalities were tried out after initial in vitrotests, on the effect of alcoholic extract of turmeric, turmeric oil, andturmeric oleoresin, were shown to protect against benzo[a]pyrene-induced increase in micronuclei in circulating lymphocytes, where - as they did not cause any increase in the number of micronuclei inlymphocytes taken from normal healthy subjects when compared tountreated controls. Patients with submucous fibrosis were treatedwith a total oral dose per day of 600 mg turmeric oil mixed with 3 gof alcoholic turmeric extract. Turmeric oleoresin 600 mg plus 3 gt u r m e r i ce x t r a c ta n d3gt u r m e r i ce x t r a c tp e rd a ys e r v e da sc o n t r o l s .All the three treatment arms reduced the number of micronucleatedcells both in the exfoliated oral mucosal cells and in circulatinglymphocytes. Turmeric oleoresin was found to be more effectivethan the others in reducing the number of micronuclei in oralmucosal cells, although in circulating lymphocytes the decrease inmicronuclei were comparable in all three groups. 33 Curcumin A phase I clinical trial has been carried out on 25 patients having high risk or precancerous lesions in order to check dose response andsafety profile. Patients who received up to 8 g\u00b7day /H110021of curcumin for 3 months showed no signs of toxicity. Although the study was designedto assess safety of the drug, there were preliminary therapeutic resultswith one out of two patients with recently resected bladder cancer,two out of seven patients of oral leukoplakia, one out of six patientsof intestinal metaplasia of stomach, one out of four patients with cer - vical intraepithelial neoplasm (CIN), and two out of six patients withRasayana Drugs 321Bowen's disease of the skin showed histological improvement of pre - cancerous lesions.34 In another phase I clinical trial on patients with advanced colorectal cancer refractory to standard treatment received an alco - holic extract of Curcuma longa in doses from 440 to 2,200 mg per day of extract for 4 months corresponding to 36-180 mg of curcumin, which was well tolerated. These dosages were considered safe andserve as reference dosages for further studies. 35 Other aspects of the safety of Curcuma longa and curcumin are covered Miers. (Family: Menispermaceae) Tinospora cordifolia (see Plate 4 in color gallery) has been men- tioned earlier in this chapter for the treatment of tuberculosis and im- proving the quality of life in chronic asthmatics. Several compoundshave been shown to have immunostimulating properties as discussedearlier in this chapter, the polysaccharide fraction has been shown to be effective in reducing experimental metastasis in mice. 36The immunostimulating activity of Tinospora cordifolia is comparable to lithium carbonate and glucan.37Activation of macrophages by Tinospora cordifolia leads to an increase of colony-forming units of granulocyte macrophages, which again leads to leukocytosis and im- proved neutrophil function.38When the carcinogen ochratoxin A was administered to mice, Tinospora cordifolia was able to inhibit sup - pression of chemotactic activity and the production of interleukin-1and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, which is a sign of increased cancer activity. 39In Dalton's lymphoma Tinospora cordifolia alcoholic ex - tract showed activity by activating tumor-associated macrophages. The extract given intraperitoneally slowed down tu - mor growth and increased life span of the host.40Administration of the methanol extract of the Tinospora cordifolia stem in experimental animals increased total white blood cell count, increased bone mar - row cellularity, increased the humoral immune response, and reduced tumor volume by 58.8 percent, and acted synergistically with cyclophosphamide in reducing animal tumors by 83 percent.41Flow322 AYURVEDIC HERBScytometric measurements in mice showed that Tinospora cordifolia induces a dose-dependent increase in bone marrow proliferation.42In vitro the methanol, water, and methylene chloride extracts of Tinospora cordifolia caused a significant, dose-dependent increase in cell death,43and also enhanced the effect of radiation in cultured HeLa cells.44A dose-searching study on humans showed that Tinospora cordifolia has great potential in reducing neutropenia caused by cytotoxic drugs in patients with cancer.45In small animals it is also able to reduce toxicity of cyclophosphamide.46 In a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized study, 40 patients with breast cancer were treated with tablets of 500 mg Tinospora cordifolia aqueous extract thrice daily as an adjuvant in cancer chemo- therapy using the combination of methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, andcyclophosphamide. In the group receiving Tinospora, the number of pa- tients whose peripheral blood counts fell below 3,000/cu.mm was 55percent compared to 70 percent in the placebo group. In the placebo-treated group the level fell below 2,000/cu.mm 24 times as compared to14 times in the Tinospora group, and below 500/cu.mm 5 times in the placebo group as compared to only once in the Tinospora group. 47 In another study in 26 patients with breast cancer, use of 500 mg Tinospora cordifolia standardized aqueous extract thrice daily in ad- dition to chemotherapy resulted in fewer adverse reactions in the Tinospora group. Tinospora cordifolia also increased the apoptotic index in a dose-dependent manner in 4,937 cells, apart induced by methotrexate, cytarabine, andcisplatin. led the authors to conclude that Tinospora cordifolia shows promise as an adjuvant in cancer chemotherapy.48 Smit (1995). 2.

Plaque is the sticky coating formed on the surface of the teeth with saliva andfood debris by several bacteria, including the bacterium Streptococ- cus mutans after consumption of food. If plaque is not removed, it gets converted to tartar by deposition of the calcium salts of the sa-liva. Further progression by attack of the acids produced by the bacte-ria in the plaque can lead not only to tooth decay or caries but also toinflammation of the gums or gingiva (gingivitis). Prolonged inflam-mation leads to loosening of the teeth and the condition known asperiodontitis. 1In addition, the importance of maintaining the health of the oral cavity has been brought out by establishing the connectionbetween chronic low grade inflammation and heart disease. 2 Thus preventive care of teeth by preventing plaque formation is very important for maintaining the health of the oral cavity, and inAyurveda dental care was carried out at three levels\u2014prophylaxis inthe form of daily care as part of the daily routine or dinacharya, treat- ment of minor conditions by drugs, and surgical interventions for se - rious conditions. 3 In Ayurveda, plants play an important role in the maintenance of healthy teeth and gums and these are generally used in combination.Some 84 plants have been used for this purpose\u2014as chewing sticks,as tooth powder for cleaning teeth and gums, for pyorrhea, for sensi - tive teeth, gum inflammation, toothache, and caries, which have been \u00a9 2006 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1300/5683_14 329reviewed.4The herbs that were most commonly used were also the ones that were readily available such as Azadirachta indica, Mangifera indica, Ocimum sanctum, Camellia sinensis, and curry koenigi.5However, a of them have been tifically investigated. Azadirachta indica Linn. (Family: Meliaceae) Azadirachta covered in Chapter 9, \"Derma - tological agents\" and in Chapter 11, \"Antidiabetic agents.\" The use ofneem twigs as chewing sticks for brushing the teeth has been known in India for a very long time. People brushing their teeth with twigs of neem is even today a common sight on Indian roadsides, where a twig of neem is selected with great care, one end chewed and softened with a stone in order to obtain a soft surface, which is used to clean the teeth and gums. Toothpastes incorporated with neem ex- tracts are available in the market in India. Various parts of the neem tree have shown antibacterial properties, which have been summa- rized.6Aqueous extract derived from sticks of neem was tested against Streptococcus mutans andStreptococcus faecalis and found active at 50 percent concentration.7Aqueous extract from bark-con- taining sticks of Azadirachta indica have also been shown to reduce the ability of some oral Streptococci to colonize tooth surfaces.8 In an exploratory study, extracts derived from plants such as neem, tulasi (Ocimum sanctum), walnut, and acacia have been used to treatplaque, periodontitis, and gingivitis in order to assess their efficacy. In the plaque-control study, the plant extracts were used for 3 days and then the plaque that was still left was scored using Quigley andHein scoring method. A 1 percent neem extract was found to inhibit plaque formation by 80 percent. In the gingivitis study, a 1 percentsolution of nimbidin-T reduced gingivitis by 12 percent after two ap - plications, but maximal reduction of 70 percent reduction was seen only after 45 days. In a microbiological study, a 6 percent neem leaf extract eliminated aerobic organisms by the 4th day and anaerobic microorganisms on the 5th day. 9 In another exploratory study, the antibacterial effect of neem mouthwash on the levels of Streptococcus mutans andLactobacillus330 AYURVEDIC HERBSwas assessed in the saliva for a period of 2 months. In addition, the effect on incipient carious lesions was evaluated. A total of 150schoolchildren between the ages of 9 and 12 were selected and di - vided into five groups out of which three groups were test groups, onegroup was positive control, and one group received placebo. Out ofthe three treatment groups, two groups received 3 percent neem mouthwash with base, one with alcohol and the other without alco - hol, group 3 received chlorhexidine, group 4 received base alone,whereas group 5 was on oral prophylaxis. Thus Streptococcus mutans was inhibited in both groups 1 and 2 using neem mouthwash, but not Lactobacillus, which was inhibited only by chlorhexidine. In addition, there is evidence from initial data that there is a reversal ofincipient carious lesions, therefore, there is a need to conduct longerduration trials to confirm the initial results. 10 In a study involving 36 subjects divided into three groups, the effi- cacy of a dental gel prepared from 70 percent alcoholic extract ofneem leaf was evaluated against 0.2 percent chlorhexidine gluconate solution and against placebo gel. Subjects used the preparationstwice a day for 6 weeks. Microbial evaluation of Streptococcus mutans andLactobacillus species was carried out to determine the change in bacterial count over the treatment period. There was signif-icant reduction in the plaque index and bacterial count in the groupusing neem extract gel over the control group using chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash. 11 The use of neem chewing sticks and neem toothpastes is wide- spread and no side effects or toxicity have been reported.

OTHER DENTAL CONDITIONS Pyorrhea Pyorrhea is the chronic destructive inflammation of the tissues sur- rounding the teeth (periodontium) characterized by bleeding, pus, and bad breath. If pyorrhea is not controlled it can lead covered in Chapter \"Gastrointestinal agents\" and in Chapter 5, \"Respiratory tract drugs.\" The leaves have been used to lessen gingival inflammation. In an open trial, 25332 AYURVEDIC HERBSpatients with pyorrhea, bleeding gums, and pus discharge were asked to apply Adhatoda vasica leaf extract on the gums for 3 weeks. The herb extract was prepared by mixing two parts of crushed leaves ofthe plant with one part of honey and applied twice a day on the gums.The gingival inflammation (GI) index was examined once a week for3 weeks. Most of the patients had a gingival score of 2-2.5 indicatingan advanced state of inflammation, with the mean score being 1.9.The scores came down to 1.7, 1.5, and 1.3 every week showing sig - nificant reduction in all the 3 weeks offering great relief to the pa - tients, with reduction in bleeding, pus, and halitosis. 1Further studies are warranted in larger patient numbers in view of the promisingresults. perennial, procumbent herb native to North Africa and cultivated on an experimental scale in Jammu and Kashmir. The roots have since long been imported into India for usein medicine. The root is used to provide relief from toothache. 2The roots contain anacyclin\u2014an acetylenic compound\u2014pellitorine\u2014theintensely pungent active principle that is a mixture of isobutylamides,although it is uncertain if it contributes to the analgesic activity\u2014enetriyne alcohol, hydrocarolin, about 50 percent inulin, volatile oil,sesamin, and some tyramine amides. 2In experimental animals the root extract has been shown to have local anesthetic activity.3 In a double-blind study on 200 patients undergoing oral surgery the anesthetic effect of a 2 percent alcoholic extract of Anacyclus py - rethrum root freshly dissolved in sterile water was compared with xylocaine. The effect on surgery, postoperative recovery, and rate ofwound healing were also evaluated. The extract had a longer periodDental and Ophthalmological Agents 333of anesthesia when compared to xylocaine and therefore found to be useful in prolonged oral reconstructive surgery.4The drug was evalu - ated as safe.4The aqueous extract root was 750 mg\u00b7kg/H110021in mice given intraperitoneally.5 Periodontitis Chronic inflammation of the tissues surrounding the teeth (peridontium) leads to loosening of teeth and eventually to tooth loss.In Ayurveda, the periodontium is described as dantamula as fruits) Terminalia chebula, Terminalia belerica, and Emblica offiicinalis, which is commonly used in Ayurveda as a bowel tonic, in oral health care, and for the care of theeyes. Triphala has shown significant analgesic, antiarthritic, and anti- inflammatory activity. 6When tested for putative use in pyorrhea against 22 species of bacteria, triphala decoction was active inhibit- ing growth of 16 bacteria.7 In a controlled study, 60 patients in different stages of inflammatory periodontal disease were selected on the basis of clinical symptomsand diagnostic criteria and divided into three groups of 20 patientseach. Group I patients were treated with triphala decoction as mouth - w a s ha n dg i v e n3gtriphala powder twice daily for 1 month. Group II was the control group patients who were treated with 400 mgmetronidazole thrice daily for 7 days together with triphala decoction as mouthwash twice daily for 1 month. Group III of 20 patients againserved as control and were treated with 400 mg metronidazole thricedaily for 7 days with 0.2 percent chlorhexidine as mouthwash twicedaily for 1 month. All patients had the calculus cleared before start ofthe trial. Patients were treated for 4 weeks, assessed every 7 days, andfollowed up for a further 1 month. The efficacy of the drug triphala was considered comparable to the modern drug, which however hadfaster onset of action, but also the modern drug had more rapid recur - rence of symptoms. 8Further studies massage rhoea.

OPHTHALMOLOGICAL AGENTS Plants have been used in Ayurveda to treat different eye conditions, including refractive disorders, cataract in the initial stages, and glau- coma. Although eye conditions have not been accorded a separatebranch in Ayurveda, such as surgery, a large number of plants havebeen used. 1In a survey1of seven major texts of Ayurveda, 41 single drugs are found to have been mentioned for 29 eye conditions. The var - ious factors, which are considered to contribute to the development of eye diseases, have also been discussed.1Plant combinations have been mainly used for conditions such as cataract and refractive errors. The traditional formulation known as Mahatriphaladi Ghrita (MTG), a preparation made of various herbs cooked in ghee or clarified butter, which is in itself considered good for the eyes, is popularly used byAyurvedic physicians to improve eyesight when taken internally andalso applied to the eyes. 2In a trial on 150 patients with primary open- angle glaucoma, patients were divided into three groups, group 1served as control and patients were treated locally with standardDental and Ophthalmological Agents 335antiglaucoma drug four times a day, group 2 received two tablespoons of MTG twice a day with warm milk, whereas group 3 received 2 per - cent pilocarpine with MTG, all medications for 90 days. Group 3 re - ceiving MTG together with pilocarpine showed optimum improve - ment, with pilocarpine contributing to quick relief and MTG toprolonged maintenance of intraocular pressure. No side effects wereseen in the MTG group, although in the pilocarpine group side effects(not specified) were reported, which were reduced in the combinationgroup. 3The effect of MTG on lipid parameters needs to be investigated in view of the use of clarified butter or ghee as base. Conjunctivitis Conjunctivitis is a common infectious condition of the eyes asso- ciated with redness, sticky discharge, burning and irritation, gritti-ness, swelling, and visual disturbances caused by pathogens of bacte-rial, fungal, or viral origin, and due to allergens. A review of differentplant species that have been used to treat conjunctivitis has been pub-lished. 4The modest amount of scientific work has been mostly in this area; exploratory trials with some plants having been carried out.Curcuma longa, with its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antibac- terial property, has been used to treat not only conjunctivitis, but alsocurcumin, the active principle has been used and tried out in chronicanterior uveitis and in orbital pseudo tumors. Other plants for whichpreliminary exploratory trials have been carried out are Berberis aristata, Cyperus rotundus, Walnut T ree, Siris T ree In a comparative study on allergic conjunctivitis, 60 patients were enrolled for the study and divided into three groups of 20336 AYURVEDIC HERBSeach. The trial preparation was made from the aqueous extract of the bark concentrated to dryness (ghanasatwa). Each capsule had 500 mg of the extract and the drops were made from 2 g percent ofthe extract. Group 1 that served as control received standard dexa - methasone two drops thrice daily for 60 days. Group 2 receivedAlbizzia lebbeck eye drops two drops thrice daily for 60 days, whereas the third group received, in addition to the Albizzia lebbeck eye drops, one capsule containing 500 mg of Albizzia lebbeck extract thrice daily again for 60 days. There was a relapse rate of 100 and 60 percent in the first two groups and the thirdgroup had only a 25 percent rate of recurrence. 5 from semisolid extracts of Berberis aristata, honey, and distilled water were tried on 100 pa- tients with conjunctivitis including cases not responding to antibiot-ics. Two to four drops of \"Madhudarvyadi\" eyedrops were instilled in each eye thrice a day. A total of 98 patients with different kinds ofconjunctivitis obtained relief. About 59 percent of patients obtainedrelief in 1-2 days, a further 29 percent in 2-4 days, and the remaining10 percent in 4-10 days. 6 Curcuma longa Linn. (Family: Zingiberaceae) In a comparative trial, 50 with conjunctivitis were treated: 25 patients with turmeric eyedrops and 25 patients with 5 percentsoframycin eyedrops. The eyedrops were instilled four to five times aday for 7 days. In patients on turmeric eyedrops, symptoms improvedday 3 with complete improvement by day 6, except for two cases. Pa - tients on soframycin also improved from day 4 and complete relieftook 7 days except for two patients, who needed 9 days for completerelief. 7Thus, treatment with turmeric eyedrops was comparable toDental and Ophthalmological Agents 337soframycin; however, further trials are required with larger patient numbers. No side effects Nut grass In an open study, the effect of an aqueous solution of a methanolic extract of Cyperus rotundus tubers was studied in patients with con- junctivitis. Most of the patients were relieved of pain and redness andconsidered cured after 5 days. 8 comparative study, 50 patients with acute conjunctivitis were divided into two groups of 25 patients each. The first group wastreated with a 5 percent aqueous solution of Glycyrrhiza glabra eye drops, whereas the second group was treated with chloramphenicoleyedrops, both medications being instilled six times a day by the pa - tients while observing hygiene. Patients receiving Glycyrrhiza glabra eyedrops showed decrease in symptoms from day 4 onwards with complete disappearance of the symptoms in 5-7 days. Therewere four patients who did not respond to the treatment. In thechloramphenicol group, all 25 patients responded in 4-7 days.Symptoms such as itching, congestion, and swelling of lids sub - s i d e df a s t e ri nt h e Glycyrrhiza glabra group compared to the chloramphenicol group, probably AYURVEDIC HERBSChronic Anterior Uveitis Curcumin A study was carried out involving 53 patients of chronic ante - rior uveitis, which is characterized by pain and redness in the eye, sensitivity to light, watering of eyes, and diminution of vision,with black spots in some patients. Thirty-two patients, who wereavailable for the trial, were divided into two groups. All 32 pa - tients were treated orally with 375 mg of 95 percent curcuminthrice daily for 12 weeks, in addition to topical mydriatics and lo- cal hot fomentation, although one group of 14 patients, who tested positive for PPD-induced delayed sensitivity, received antituber-cular drugs for 1 year, since it has been postulated that uveitisarises due to tuberculosis. The remaining 18 patients receivedcurcumin alone. A marked clinical improvement was observed inboth groups with improvement in vision, decrease in aqueousflare, and keratic precipitates, and break of anterior and posteriorsynechiae. Improvement was slow initially but became satisfac-tory after 2 weeks. No side effects due to curcumin were observed. 10 The results warrant further clinical studies. Idiopathic Inflammatory Orbital Pseudotumors Curcumin In a small exploratory trial on eight patients with idiopathic in - flammatory orbital pseudotumors, 375 mg curcumin was adminis - tered orally thrice daily for 6-22 months. Patients were followed up every 3 months for a total of 2 years. Of the five patients who com - pleted the study, four patients recovered completely, whereas in theremaining one patient, swelling came down completely; however,there was restriction in movement. No side effects were observed. 11 Further studies are warranted.Dental and Ophthalmological Agents decoction, powder, and ghrita (prep - aration with clarified butter or ghee as base) of Rubia cordifolia were tried in painful ophthalmic conditions both internally and topically and found to relieve pain without any side effects. Further details arenot available in the abstract and this study is mentioned for record. 12 Glaucoma Glaucoma is characterized by increasing intraocular pressure causing compression of the blood vessels to the retina resulting, overtime, in loss of vision. Coleus forskohlii Lamiaceae) Forskolin, the active principle forskohlii, has been evaluated for use in glaucoma only in healthy volunteers, which has been reviewed. 13 NOTES 1.
