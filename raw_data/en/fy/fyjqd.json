This disease is growing at a rapid rate and it is impacting the health of this generation and future generations to come. Diabetes is a disease that impairs the body's ability to produce or respond to the insulin hormone produced by the pancreas. The insulin allows for the glucose to be effectively used as energy throughout the body. Diabetes causes carbohydrates to be abnormally digested, which can raise blood glucose levels. This means that the glucose is not being taken up by the cells that need it. The cells cannot take up the excess glucose that has accumulated in the blood, so it is excreted through the urine. This can lead to problems with the kidneys, central nervous system, heart, and eyes because high blood glucose can damage the blood vessels of these organs. This diseased is managed by adopting a diet low in fat and high in fiber, increasing physical activity, losing excess weight, and not smoking. If this 29 million people in the United States (9.3 percent) have diabetes, and of those 29 million approximately 7.25 million are unaware that they are diabetic (www.cdc.gov). Diabetes describes a group of metabolic diseases in which the person has high blood glucose because insulin production is inadequate, or because the body 's cells do not respond properly to insulin, or both. Diabetes can be divided into two groups: Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is also referred to as juvenile diabetes and is usually found in children and young adults. Only 5% of people with diabetes have this form of the disease. Type 1 diabetes restricts the body from producing insulin, a hormone that is needed to convert sugar, starches and other food into energy needed for daily life. Type 1 diabetes can be managed by using insulin therapy and other treatments to help those infected maintain insulin to convert sugars, starches and foods into energy(www.diabetes.org). Type 2 diabetes is the most common, people with Type 2 diabetes have insulin resistance meaning the body does not use insulin properly. At first, the pancreas makes a surplus insulin to compensate for the lack on insulin in your body. However, over time your pancreas is not able to keep up and can not make enough insulin to keep your blood glucose at normal levels(www.diabetes.org). Complications of diabetes in the long term include potential heart disease, stroke, and kidney damage. Diabetes mellitus type 2 is an endocrine disorder that causes impaired use of carbohydrates while enhancing the use of proteins and lipids. This is called insulin resistance, in which the pancreas cannot make enough insulin to keep blood glucose levels normal, or the body is unable to use what is produced. The impairment causes blood glucose level to rise higher than normal. There is no cure for type 2 diabetes mellitus and it is life threatening when left untreated. Signs and symptoms of this disorder include vision changes, increased thirst, increased hunger, increased frequency of urination, stomach pain, nausea and vomiting, erectile dysfunction, and absences of mentruation. These can occur abruptly, or over a long period of time. Introduction Diabetes is a metabolic disease where an individual's blood glucose level is higher than normal standards. Diabetes is a long term condition that causes not only primary issues related to the disease but secondary problems as well. Diabetes also known and referred to by healthcare professionals as diabetes mellitus, which is a phrase used to describe a group of metabolic diseases in which a person's body does not produce insulin at all, or a person's body does not use insulin properly, which is called insulin resistance. Type I Diabetes also known as juvenile diabetes is when the body does not produce insulin, approximately 10% of all diabetes cases are type I. Type 2 diabetes is when the body does not use insulin properly and approximately 90% of all documented cases worldwide is of this type. (American Diabetes Association, 2014) All types of diabetes can be treated, type I has no known cure however there have been some cases where Running Head: Diabetes Type II Diabetes Type II: Symptoms, Risk Factors, and Treatments Introduction There are three types of diabetes: type 1diabetes and type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes. All three are chronic conditions that \"affect how the body uses blood glucose\" or blood sugar. The body needs glucose because it is \"an important source of energy for the cells that make up an individual 's muscles and tissues\" Individuals with diabetes have too much glucose in their blood, which will inevitably lead to serious problems with a person 's health. Since every cell, tissue, and muscle needs glucose to function properly, it is important for a person who shows signs and symptoms of diabetes to see a doctor It is no secret that Diabetes type II is rapidly becoming a public health problem that is attacking epidemic proportions worldwide. In fact, according to an online article by the Washington post titled, \"CDC Says Diabetes Numbers Increasing,\" Author Stein, Rob claims that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that as of the year 2012, approximately 26 million Americans were clinically diagnosed with type II diabetes. Not to be confused type I diabetes however. Type I diabetes is where the body is typically insulin-dependent as beta cells are constantly attacked and destroyed by the immune system. Type II diabetes on the other hand, is where the body, may or may not make enough insulin; a hormone that serves to regulate the movement of sugars into the cells, and if it does make enough insulin, the body tends to not respond to it properly. In other words, one suffering from type II diabetes does not convert sugar into energy, but rather stores it in their bloodstream. This has caused type II diabetes to be the most common form of its type. As a result, those who suffer from type II Diabetes normally result in extra body-fat, hypertension, and high cholesterol. Diabetes is a chronic disease. It happens when a person has high blood glucose (sugar), either because insulin production is insufficient, or because the body's cells do not respond well to insulin, or both. Diabetes needs continuing medical care, continuing patient self-management and support, to reduce the risk of long-term disability and prevent complications. There are three types of diabetes. Type 1 Diabetes, Type 2 Diabetes and Gestational diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is caused when body does not produce insulin. Patients with this type of diabetes should take insulin injections for the rest of their life, guarantee proper blood-glucose levels by regular blood tests and following a special diet and exercises. In Type 2 Diabetes, cells do Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S., according to the CDC. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes (CDC, 2014). 90- 95% of the people with diabetes have Type 2 (CDC, 2014). Historically, type 2 diabetes has been diagnosed primarily in middle-aged adults (CDC, 2014). Today, however, adolescents and young adults are developing type 2 diabetes at an alarming rate. Unlike people with type 1 diabetes, the body produces insulin but either their pancreas does not make enough insulin or the body cannot use the insulin well enough. This is called insulin resistance. When there isn 't enough insulin or the insulin is not used as it should be, glucose can 't get into the body 's cells. When glucose Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of Americans. There are only two types of it. Type one is the most serious type. It is caused by the body's inability to produce enough insulin. Type two is developed when the body can't efficiently use the insulin that is available to absorb sugar into the cells. So the sugar builds up in the body. Usually, type two diabetes is more common in adults, but there has been a sudden increase in the amount of children that are developing it. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) isn't sure why it is happening though. This article will discuss a few of the key areas that research has pinpointed as contributors to the problem. Diabetes in general is when there is a problem with your body that causes the blood glucose (sugar) to rise higher than they normally would. This can also be known as Hyperglycemia. Type 2 Diabetes is a chronic condition and will affect the way the body processes the blood sugar (glucose). Type 2 Diabetes can also be known as Adult Onset Diabetes. In 90%-95% of all diabetic cases, Type 2 Diabetes is the most common form of diabetes. A person typically gets diabetes after the age of 40, but anyone can get it at any age. It is now being seen in young children everyday. If you have Type 2 Diabetes, it either means one of two things. The first being that your body doesn't produce enough insulin. The second being that your body seems to resist insulin. This can be referred to as insulin resistance. In the beginning, your pancreas will be able to make the extra insulin. Unfortunately, over time it won't be able to keep up with it and won't be able to keep your blood glucose at the normal levels that it should be. When the glucose starts building up in your blood, instead of in your cells, it can cause two main problems. The first problem is that your cells may be starved for energy. The second problem is that over a period of time, the high blood glucose levels can start to even hurt your eyes, kidneys, nerves, or heart. No one should have to go through Type 2 Diabetes, but several people do. In the below paragraphs, I will explain the causes/risk factors, signs and symptoms, What is a normal range of blood sugar? Diabetes is a chronic disease in which the body has too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. In the case of type one diabetes, this depends on having the pancreas produces insulin because of injury that causes high levels of blood sugar Insulin is the hormone that the body uses to convert glucose into ATP, or adenosine triphosphate andenosine, the \"energy currency\" of life. This is normally due to damage caused by the patient's immune system and tend to occur early in life. In the case of diabetes type two time that can occur at any age, this is often due to the body becomes insensitive to insulin, so it can not use. Earlier this allows the body to create more insulin to compensate for this problem, but with time it will no longer suffice. The extra glucose in the body will then cause various problems, including heart and circulatory problems, eye damage, and nerve damage (neuropathy) that can have all kinds of negative effects. Type 2: In type 2 diabetes, the pancreas produces insulin, however the body doesn't respond to it as it should, this is because the quantities of the insulin being produced are insufficient, or the body's cells just don't react to it and so the glucose levels in the system remain high. Type 2 diabetes is a 'progressive disease' and can get worse if it is not managed properly. Long term effects of high blood sugar can result in heart disease or kidney Introduction Diabetes Mellitus is a disease of the endocrine system primarily differentiated between type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes occurs when the pancreas is unable to produce insulin and was previously seen in the younger generation which is no longer the case.1 Type 2 diabetes is the more prevalent of the two types and involves elevated blood sugar levels due to the insufficient production of insulin. Risk factors that make an individual higher risk for type 2 diabetes include increasing age, obesity, family history, a sedentary lifestyle.1,2 Innovative drug therapies for type 2 diabetes remain important for the treatment and reduction of the disease. Are You a Victim of Diabetes Diabetes is when a person has too much sugar in the blood and the body can not regulate it. Diabetes can affect all ages from children to adults. There are commonly known types of diabetes which are type 1 and type 2. A person might not know that they have diabetes because it is not always recognized. There are many warning signs that you may never even thought about. Some warning signs are becoming extremely thirsty or hungry even after you just had something to eat or drink. Most people end up losing weight no matter how much they eat. They tend to go to the bathroom a lot. Although diabetes can be a dangerous and even life threatening. To help control diabetes, it would help if you eat healthy and exercise. Diabetes is a disease that cases blood glucose levels to rise higher than normal in the body. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes when being compared to type 1diabetes. When blood sugars rises to levels higher than normal it is called hyperglycemia. Diabetes, type 2 can result in many different issues that affect the body. There are many complications that are linked with diabetes for example, higher risk "}
