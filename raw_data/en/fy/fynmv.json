The score card was with our nation's infant mortality rate being in last place and the nation with the lowest infant mortality rate in first place and comparing their vaccination practices. The United States Infant mortality rate is the worst of 58 developed countries and the Autism rate in America is the highest in the world. We vaccinate new born babies on day one and we now schedule over 75 vaccine boosters to a child by the time they turn 18. Our U.S. score is the most infant mortalities, U.S. is last place and the most Autistic children in the world. Japan's children have the same Blood Brain Barrier in their children as our children, imagine that, physiology and child development is the same, yet they are number one in the world with the lowest infant mortality rates. Do they vaccinate their children? Yes they do. So what's the deal? This is not about vaxers and antivaxers. They do not vaccinate till the child is nearly 7 years old and the vaccine is green. Cuba has virtually no health care system. The money spent per individual is less than $500/year. The United States is averaging around $8000 per individual per year and we are in last place there also with adults and children. Cuba gives green vaccines. What is a Green Vaccine? In the United States we put: Preservatives, phenol, hydrolyzed porcine gelatin (MSG from pig), detergent... Please log on to CDC and type in ingredients in vaccine and read this list yourself. Then type in what ingredients are in each vaccine. Then study Blood Brain Barrier. When does the Blood Brain Barrier develop and mature in a child? Then look at what weakens Blood Brain Barrier in adults. Go to Pub Med and read several thousand articles from the top scientist in the world that have specific comments from their findings about the Blood Brain Barrier. Now for the 'What is in this for me?' How can I raise my immunity and not damage my blood brain barrier? The Take Home is this: 1. Avoidance is one way: buy organic, cook at home, eat vegetables, fruits and nuts and drink clean pure water. 2. Get Quality Omega 6 Omega 3 oils in a 2:1 ratio 3. Build up Glutathione in the body, especially in the liver. 4. Build a healthy gut: Probiotics and quality foods. All of the additives weaken Blood Brain Barrier in Adults and easily make their way into the delicate developing brain of a child. Did you know NSAID's damage Glutathione and lower glutathione in the body the fastest. How many American's take NSAID's, ibuprophen, aspirin, Tylenol, etc? We consume more than 40 tons of NSAID's per day. In some states you can ask for green vaccine. Cuba inoculates 'green'. MSG in vaccine is outlawed. Ask your doctor for the fact sheet of what is in your vaccine. Study the sheet. If it has the above list of ingredients, OH! I didn't mention fetal baby cells, you can ask if there is a vaccine without those additives. Could our infant mortality and autism poor results change if we practiced vaccines differently? Over to you, it is your body and your choice. Catching up on CDC and The Defender reports from the end of May 2021: Dr. Ferrer, Community Health Director for LA county, reports 12 Fully Vaccinated People Died of Covid but four had weakened immune systems. Never did CDC say some one died of COVID had a weakened immune system, but now that you have had the shot you had other Comorbidity. May 20, 2021 Dr. McCullough authors paper in American Journal of Medicine asking where is the conversation about COVID treatments? He estimates that 85% of COVID deaths could have been prevented. McCullough said, \"What frustrated me, was in the media cycle, all we heard about was reducing spread, and then later on vaccination. We never actually heard about treating sick patients.\" AND YOU STILL DON'T-EMPHASIS MINE!! May 24, 2021 FDA warns Covid Antibody tests CANNOT prove you are immune to the virus from prior infection OR vaccination, FDA warns. CDC and Biden continue to say it does in the media. May 19, 2021 Nine Fully Vaccinated Yankee Players Tested Positive for COVID after Vaccination. Healthy men in the prime of their athletic career. June 2, 2021 Bill Gates files dozens of patens for artificial foods, and hundreds in the wing June 22, 2021 Children Should Not Be Vaccinated for the Moment, The WHO states \"There is not yet enough evidence on the use of vaccines against COVID-19 in children to make recommendations for children to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Children and adolescents tend to have milder disease compared to adults.\" Dr. Kate O'Brien, a pediatrician and director of the WHO, further adds, \"It wasn't necessary to vaccinate children before sending them back to school safely.\" Children are very rarely affected by this disease, states, Adam Finn, sits on UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization. The FDA held a meeting June 10 to discuss Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), numerous experts say \"the BENEFITS DON'T OUTWEIGH THE RISKS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN.\" Peter Doshi, Ph.D., associate professor at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy and senior editor of The BMJ, said during the public hearing session there is no emergency that would warrant using EUA to authorize COVID vaccines for children.\" Doshi pointed to data from CDC showing 23% of 0-to4-year olds and 42% of 5-to17-yearolds have already had COVID and have ROBUST NATURAL IMMUNITY.
