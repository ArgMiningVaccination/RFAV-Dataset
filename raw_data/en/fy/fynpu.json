Virus neutralization is the best available correlate of protection. We used sera from cohorts of individuals vaccinated with two or three doses of RNA (BNT162b2) or inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (Coronavac or Sinopharm) vaccines with or without a history of previous SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-1 (in 2003) infection, to de\u0000ne the magnitude and breath of cross-neutralization in a multiplex surrogate neutralization assay based on virus spike receptor binding domain of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC), SARS-CoV-2 related bat and pangolin viruses, SARS-CoV-1 and related bat sarbecoviruses. SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-1 infection followed by BNT162b2 vaccine, Omicron BA.2 breakthrough infection following BNT162b2 vaccine or a third dose of BNT162b2 following two doses of BNT162b2 or CoronaVac elicited the highest and broadest neutralization across VOCs. Considering breadth and magnitude of neutralization across all sarbecoviruses, those infected with SARS-CoV-1 immunized with BNT162b2 outperformed all other combinations of infection and/or vaccination. These data may inform vaccine design strategies for generating broadly neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 variants or across the sarbecovirus subgenus. Introduction Vaccine mediated protection against COVID-19 is primarily determined by neutralizing antibody titer 1. Neutralizing antibodies directly interfere with the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 virion Spike (S) receptor binding domain (RBD) with the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is predominantly expressed in the lung, gut and heart. However, VoC have emerged that have accumulated mutations in the S, especially the RBD, which results in escape from neutralizing antibodies generated by the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus from Wuhan in 2019. The greatest threat so far has been VOC Omicron (B.1.1.529) and its subvariants. It was \u0000rst reported in November 2021. It is about 50 non-silent mutations and over 2/3 of these mutations are in the spike domain 2. In 2002, SARS-CoV (herein called SARS-CoV-1) emerged and caused 8,000 infections with public health measures abating the outbreak 3, unlike SARS-CoV-2, which since 2019 has infected over 500 million people within 24 months, countered by over 12 billion doses of highly effective COVID-19 vaccines have been given to mitigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2. The most predominantly used SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, are inactivated whole virion adjuvanted vaccines (e.g. Coronavac), which have been more widely administered due to ease, scalability and lower cost of production and relative thermostability in contrast to the second most used vaccine, Spike encoding mRNA vaccines 4. However, there is at least 10-fold difference in neutralizing antibody titers between these vaccines 5,6, which results in lower protective e\u0000cacy of inactivated vaccines 1. This lower protection may be due to mismatch between vaccine induced antibodies and native conformation of the virus spike as -propiolactone is used to split the SARS-CoV-2 virion for inactivation which may affect S conformation. In contrast, mRNA vaccines are expressed by host cells in an S-2P stabilized conformation as a pre-fusion form directly representing the S as it appears on virions.Page 4/22S-speci\u0000c antibodies wane, faster in the \u0000rst few months and slower later, after infection 7. This is expected as plasmablast responses contract and a stable memory B cell pool forms with reduced antibody output during convalescence. However, antibody waning post-vaccination, across different vaccine formats is also substantial, leading to reduced protective e\u0000cacy against infection at 6 months post 2-dose vaccination. Reassuringly protection against severe disease is not as compromised and other immune correlates such as T cells and non-neutralising antibody functions may contribute to this longer duration of protection 8-10. To maintain protection against mild disease, booster third-dose vaccinations were recommended in mid-2021 in Israel, which led 11x increase in protection within 2 weeks post vaccination 11, and have since become required for full vaccination in many developed countries. However, waning antibody responses have again occurred, and fourth dose vaccination is now being considered in mid-2022 for at risk individuals in some countries. It is evident we cannot \"boost our way\" out of the high public health burden and high circulation of SARS-CoV-2 VoCs. We therefore must de\u0000ne the immune priming-boosting strategies that elicit broadly reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to counter future variants and inform next generation vaccines that may protect us from other sarbecoviruses. The phenomenon of Original Antigenic Sin (OAS) 12 occurs where the antigen we are \u0000rst primed against limits our capacity to respond to novel antigenic epitopes presented by closely related variants, due to clonal competition of B cells at subsequent encounters. OAS can play a signi\u0000cant role in capping in\u0000uenza vaccine e\u0000cacy 13, whereby antigenic focusing can occur with repeated vaccination 14. The impact of OAS is impacted by antigenic distance 13, the serological 'space' a virus may occupy, and re- vaccination with a distinct serotype may then justi\u0000ed. This forms the basis of strain updates to seasonal in\u0000uenza vaccines. Heterologous vaccine regimes of alternating formats and adjuvants can improve vaccine responses by recruiting existing memory and generating new responses leading to synergistic results 15,16. Coronavac includes an Alum adjuvant which acts as a TLR7 agonist to improve antigen presentation 17. The majority of adults are seropositive to related boosted by SARS-CoV-2 infection and are therefore cross-reactive to some extent 18, but they do not mediate a protective response to reduce the duration of illness nor viral shedding 19,20. The observation that mRNA vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines of SARS-1 convalescent individuals led to generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies 21, has provided hope for pan-sarbecovirus vaccines as the \"holy grail\" for next generation vaccines. In this study, we sought to identify immune priming conditions that generate broadly neutralizing antibody responses. Results Inhibition of ACE2 binding to ancestral, VoC Beta and Delta RBD by antibody in the multiplex sVNT assay correlates with the plate sVNT assay To assess the relative a\u0000nity of different RBD proteins for the human ACE2 (Figure 1a), a 16-plex panel of RBD proteins representing SARS-CoV-2, related variants of concern (VoC), clade 2 bat and pangolin derived viruses, in addition to the SARS-CoV-1 virus and related clade 1 bat viruses (Bat CoV WIV-1,Page 5/22RsSHC014, LYRa11, Rs2018B), were tested for neutralizing activity by immune plasma from different priming conditions (Table 1). Plasma samples from individuals convalescent from mild ancestral SARS- CoV-2 infections elicited neutralising antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 and related VoC Alpha, Delta and Lambda, but minimal responses to other SARS-CoV-2 VoCs, bat sarbecoviruses or SARS-CoV-1 (Figure 1ab). The neutralization response was relatively short-lived, from 30-60 days post infection, with most antibody responses below 20% inhibition by day 80-270. Live virus neutralisation strongly correlated with the plate format 22 (r=0.89) and bead format (r=0.9) sVNT assays (Figure 1cd). The plate and bead sVNT assays were also well correlated for the ancestral virus (r=0.85, Figure 1e), VoC Beta (r=0.83) and Delta (r=0.76) (Supplementary \u0000gure 1ab). However, these correlations not extend to the Omicron BA.1 bead sVNT with PRNT results used the RBD of BA1 Omicron in a \u0000xed plate based commercial assay, whilst other RBDs were assessed in parallel in the multiplex bead format for further analysis. mRNA vaccination increases antibody breadth dependent on priming conditions The breadth of antibody responses from alum adjuvanted inactivated whole virion vaccine, mRNA Spike lipoprotein BNT162b2 in previously BNT162b2 vaccination (Figure 2a) signi\u0000cantly boosted neutralizing antibodies against 10 of 16 RBD proteins (signi\u0000cance by ^^) including all VoCs except Omicron, as well as bat RaTG13 and pangolin Gx-P5L viruses but not to SARS-CoV-1 and related sarbecoviruses. Coronavac only boosted responses to 8 of 16 RBD proteins (signi\u0000cance by ##), but to lower magnitude. The BNT162b2 post-vaccination sVNT responses were substantially higher than Coronavac in 10 of 16 RBDs (signi\u0000cance by **). Therefore, the overall magnitude of neutralizing antibody responses by Coronavac vaccination was substantially lower than BNT162b2 vaccination and not above the 20% inhibition cut-off for any RBD protein (Figure 2a). BNT162b2 vaccination 1 year after recovery from mild ancestral SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 2b) led to very high (mean >50% inhibition) responses against all VoCs including Omicron as well as bat RaTG13 and pangolin Gx-P5L viruses and lower (mean inhibition between 20-50%) against SARS-CoV-1 and other sarbecoviruses. Coronavac also elicited responses above the 20% cut-off against 15 of 16 RBD proteins, but 9 of these (SARS-CoV-2, VoC's Alpha, Delta, Lambda, Bat CoV RaTG13 and Pangolin Gx-P5L) were still signi\u0000cantly lower in comparison with BNT162b2 vaccination. Thus, prior immune priming with SARS-CoV-2 infection substantially improved the antibody breadth and magnitude of responses to inactivated whole virus vaccines, but not to the same extent as S-speci\u0000c mRNA vaccination. Priming by prior exposure to SARS-CoV-1 infection, 18 years prior to BNT162b2 vaccination (n=7) elicited pan-sarbecovirus antibodies to all RBDs tested, covering both the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 clades.Page 6/22Coronavac vaccination after SARS-CoV-1 infection (n=2), showed post vaccination responses across the RBD panel (Figure 2c), but our small samples size precludes statistical comparisons. Vaccination of SARS-CoV-1 recovered individuals in Guangzhou with Sinopharm (Figure 2d), another inactivated SARS- CoV-2 vaccine used in mainland China, to responses to SARS-CoV-2 variants (except Omicron), SARS- CoV-1 and related sarbecoviruses but post vaccination rises were only signi\u0000cant in 3 of 16 RBDs (ancestral, VoCs Alpha and Gamma). The breadth and magnitude of the RBD-speci\u0000c neutralizing antibody response across these prior infection conditions by heatmap (Figure 2e), shows limited clade 1 antibodies without prior infection, i.e. in Coronavac and BNTb162b2 vaccination of na\u00efve individuals. Whilst prior COVID-19 with vaccination increases the breadth and magnitude of the RBD antibody response. Furthermore, BNT162b2 vaccination shows higher magnitude responses than inactivated vaccines, especially with historic SARS-CoV-1 infection. Third dose mRNA vaccination boosts SARS-CoV-1 clade neutralizing antibody responses We conducted an observational study of third dose vaccination of Coronavac or BNT126b2, following homologous 2-dose priming with either Coronavac or BNT126b2, in comparison groups (CC+C, CC+B, BB+C, BB+B) (Figure 3ab). The third dose vaccination was given approximately 6 months after the second vaccination. The post third dose BNT162b2 vaccination following either BNT162b2 or Coronavac priming led to substantial boosting of antibody responses across the panel (Figure 3b) to 14 and 13 of 16 RBDs, respectively. Whilst Coronavac priming followed by a third dose of Coronavac led to signi\u0000cant increases in antibody in 5 of 16 RBDs, the magnitude of these responses was substantially lower than third dose BNT162b2 groups. There was no boosting of neutralizing antibody in those given a third dose of Coronavac following two-dose priming with BNT162b2. Antibody responses following Omicron BA.2 infection in vaccinated or na\u00efve individuals We compared acute (day 0-5 of infection) and convalescent (1-2 months post infection) sera from Omicron infection in those previously na\u00efve or vaccinated with BNT162b2 or Coronavac vaccination (Figure 4ab). For BA.2 infection in BNT162b2 vaccinated subjects there were signi\u0000cant increases for 6 RBDs of clade 2 SARS-CoV-2 viruses at recovery, with high magnitude (>50% inhibition) across all clade 2 RBDs, and detectable responses (above the 20% cutoff) for clade 1 viruses but not increased from acute timepoints. In addition, Coronavac primed individuals infected with Omicron BA.2, had signi\u0000cant increases in antibody responses to 4 RBDs of clade 2 SARS-CoV-2 viruses at recovery, whilst clade 1 responses were unchanged. In marked contrast, recovery from Omicron BA.2. in those without prior vaccine or infection priming did not lead to increases in antibody responses to any RBDs (excluding VoC Gamma), demonstrating its poor immunogenicity. Page 7/22 Overview of antigenic diversity from different priming conditions To provide an overview of our results above, we generated a 2-D representation of all tested samples (Table 1) to determine which priming conditions led to broader and higher magnitude antibody responses to a range of SARS-CoV-2 VoCs (Figure 5a) and across all sarbecoviruses (Figure 5b). RBD cross- reactivity is a measure of the antibody response diversity, i.e. the frequencies of responses to different RBD proteins above a 20% inhibition cut-off (see Methods). The priming conditions that yielded magnitude (>75% inhibition) and breadth (>75% cross-reactivity) of SARS-CoV-2 VoC antibody responses (Figure 5a) included the groups SARS-2 followed by BNT162b2, third SARS-1 or Whilst inactivated vaccines, Coronavac and Sinopharm in SARS-1 convalescents led to high antigenic diversity, the magnitude of these responses was not maximized (40-50% inhibition). Thus, third dose vaccination and BNT162b2 vaccination after COVID-19 recovery results in maximal antibody diversity and response magnitude and should be continued to be recommended to increase protection against future VoC. When both magnitude and breadth of responses to the broader RBD panel including SARS-CoV-1 clade viruses are considered, i.e. true pan-sarbecovirus antibody responses (Figure 5B), SARS-CoV-1 followed by BNT162b2 vaccination is signi\u0000cantly better than any other condition. Several conditions including SARS-2 followed by BNT162b2 or Coronavac immunization, third dose followed Coronavac immunization, Omicron breakthrough infections in BNT162b2 vaccinated provide high breadth of protection (>75%) across the sarbecovirus group with moderate magnitude of antibody inhibition. Two doses of BNT162b2 or Coronavac, three doses of Coronavac or two doses of BNT162b2 followed by Coronavac do not yield antibody with either higher breadth or magnitude. Discussion Optimal strategies for developing and using vaccines that protect against current, and hopefully future, SARS-CoV-2 VoCs (\"variant-proof vaccines\" COVID-19 vaccines) are a current priority for global public health. Since other sarbecoviruses, not just SARS-CoV-2, continue to pose future pandemic threats, strategies that elicit broad sarbecovirus immune responses also need to be developed. The diversity of priming, boosting and hybrid antibody responses generated by available COVID-19 vaccines in the context of circulating virus variants provides an opportunity to provide understanding to address these challenges. Omicron is the most divergent VoC of SARS-CoV-2 to emerge to date. This diversity is further enhanced by those who survived SARS-CoV-1 in 2003 who are now being immunized with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. A recently described multiplex bead surrogate neutralization assay provides the opportunity to investigate neutralizing antibody responses to a range of SARS-CoV-2 variants and sarbecoviruses 21,23. We assembled a panel of plasma samples from individuals with a variety of conditions of priming,Page 8/22boosting and infection histories to investigate how these impact on the breadth and magnitude of neutralizing antibody responses to this broad panel of SARS-CoV-2 VoCs and sarbecoviruses. We found that the results of multiplex sVNT assay correlated \"gold standard\" PRNT assay for the ancestral virus and multiple VoCs, with the exception of Omicron variant BA.1. We therefore used the plate-based sVNT for Omicron VoC for more reliable results that may be due to conformational differences in the stability of Omicron RBD. Many of these sera have been previously tested in PRNT assays using the ancestral virus and Omicron with previously reported data from PRNT assays; (1) that two dose BNT162b2 vaccination was more immunogenic than two doses of Coronavac but both were poor at eliciting neutralizing antibody to VoC Omicron BA.1 24,25; (2) a third dose of BNT162b2 following two doses of either BNT162b2 or Coronavac elicited neutralizing antibody to Omicron BA.1 while three doses of Coronavac failed to do so 24; (3) that hybrid immunity elicited by a single dose of BNT162b2 in those previously convalescent from ancestral SARS-CoV-2 infection elicited broader neutralizing antibody responses across the SARS-CoV-2 VoCS including Omicron, to levels at least comparable to three doses of BNT162b2 24,25 ; and (4) that Omicron BA.2 breakthrough infections in BNT162b2 or Coronavac vaccinated individuals elicited broad neutralization of all VoCS tested in either PRNT or sVNT assays 25. The multiplex sVNT assay further demonstrated that cross reactivity generated by these vaccines and hybrid immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 VoC, extended to the related bat RaTG13 and pangolin Gx-P5L viruses, even better than to Omicron VoC, but not necessarily to the more distantly related SARS-CoV-1 and sarbecoviruses. We devised a 2D depiction where both the breadth and magnitude of sVNT neutralizing antibody responses could be visualized. The greatest breadth and magnitude neutralization activity across the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 related sarbecoviruses was elicited by those recovered from SARS-CoV-1 infection in 2003 vaccinated with two doses of BNT162b2, the weakest, though moderate neutralizing activity among all 16 virus RBDs being to Omicron BA.1. This suggests that prime and boost with antigenically diverse sarbecoviruses provided the optimal breadth and magnitude of neutralizing activity. Since Omicron appears to be the most antigenically divergent RBD 23, one may speculate that individuals primed with an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 antigen (e.g. BNT162b2) boosted with an effective Omicron-spike vaccine or a bivalent Omicron and SARS-CoV-1 vaccine may lead to comparable or superior breadth of immunity. However, the number of RBD mutations does not de\u0000ne neutralizing antibody escape, and Omicron represents a challenge in being more genetically similar but antigenically distant to ancestral SARS-CoV-2, than other clade 2 viruses Bat CoV RaTG13 and pangolin CoV GX-P5L Furthermore, recovery from Omicron infection in Coronavac and BNT162b2 vaccinated individuals, generated antibody breadth but did not maximize response magnitude to the same extent as SARS-CoV-1 infection. Similarly, recent SARS-CoV-2 infection then subsequent BNT162b2 vaccination generated greater SARS-CoV-2 clade antibody responses than prior SARS-CoV-1 infection, however these responses were not maximized in terms of magnitude either, which could also be attributable to one dose versus two dose vaccination respectively. Therefore, either SARS-CoV-1 represents an antigenic 'sweet spot' for generating broadPage 9/22antibody responses, or recall of a long term memory B cell response, from infection 18 years prior, adds to response magnitude capacity. This could be exploited by mosaic vaccines or heterologous prime boost approaches. High level of cross-reactivity was elicited by hybrid immunity involving ancestral or Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infections and BNT162b2 vaccination, although the magnitude of neutralizing activity was less than that following SARS-CoV-1 infection. A third dose of BNT162b2 also elicited notable breadth of cross- neutralizing activity across the sarbecovirus group, even in Coronavac primed subjects. It remains to be seen whether the durability of this magnitude and breadth following three doses of BNT162b2 vaccination alone is similar to that elicited by hybrid immunity. Furthermore, it remains to be determined if the high cross-reactivity of BNT162b2 responses generated 1 month after vaccination are an artefact of high magnitude of the antibody response, and what response is actually functionally recalled in vivo during infection months or years later. This applies to both durability of circulating antibody as well as memory B cell responses because rapid recall of memory B cell responses may well compensate for a fall in circulating antibody levels. It is notable that in those convalescent from ancestral SARS-CoV-2 infection, there was a gradual decline of both breadth and magnitude of neutralizing responses over time. Limitations: a) Our neutralization assay only assesses neutralizing activity directed to the RBD and does not assess neutralizing activity directed to other known regions of the S protein, including the N terminal domain (NTD), the S2 domain, or S-2P-ecto domains 26,27. It is however worth to note that the majority of SARS- CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies target the RBD region, whilst deletion of NTD antibodies have minimal impact on neutralization 28. b) We have focused on neutralizing activity, which is the only known correlate of protection so far 1,29. But it is likely that T cell responses 8 and non-neutralizing antibody and functions 9,10 also contribute to protection against severe disease. c) We have only compared RNA vaccines and inactivated vaccines but not assessed other vaccine strategies such as the adenovirus vectored vaccines. However, these 2 vaccines represent distinct platforms known to induce neutralizing antibodies at the high and low ends of the antibody response range, respectively, and are most widely used vaccines globally. Recently, a related study has investigated booster vaccines, including viral vectored AZD1222 23, with a similar reporting of mRNA vaccine advantage for antibody breadth. MethodsPage 10/22Study participants for serum panels Plasma panels from cohorts with different combinations of vaccination and natural infection were used in the study (Table 1, see Supplementary \u0000le for subject demographics, age 49 +/- 13 years, range 21-77 years). Pre-pandemic plasma samples (n=30) were used as negative controls for antibody for inhibition of ACE2 binding of the 16-plex RBD panel and used to calculate % inhibition for each RBD. To assess antibody waning and breadth, SARS-CoV-2 convalescent samples obtained from individuals with infection occurring in the period January to March 2020 when the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 was circulating were used, with samples collected at day 30-60 (n=20), day 80-270 (n=20), day 365 (n=22) post infection, with no further vaccination or infection during sampling. This corresponds to the SARS-CoV-2 used in the vaccine, RBD panel and PRNT assay. To assess vaccine immunogenicity, plasma was collected from previously uninfected subjects, prior to receiving the \u0000rst vaccine dose and at 1 month post 2-dose vaccination with BNTb162b2 or Coronavac (n =30). To assess the impact of prior infection (hybrid immunity), subjects (n=20) who recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection (346+/-105 days between SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination), were assessed 1 month after 1 dose vaccination with BNT162b2 or Coronavac. Participants with prior exposure to SARS- CoV-1 in 2003 were recruited in Hong Kong (HK) and sampled pre- and 1 month post 2-dose vaccination with BNT162b2 (n=7) or Coronavac (n=2). In addition, in Guangzhou (GZ), with 'baseline' serum from 2018 (n=10) and post 2-dose vaccination with Sinopharm were sampled at 1 month (n=6), 3 month (n=5) and 6 months (n=2) post vaccination. To assess the impact of heterologous third dose vaccination for either BNT162b2 or Coronavac, individuals were randomized 3 months after 2-doses of vaccination with either Coronavac or BNT162b2 to receive a third dose of Coronavac (CCC) or BNT162b2 (BBB), and samples collected at pre-third dose and 1 month post third dose vaccination (group and timepoint n=20 each). Omicron infection (BA.2 predominant strain at time of serum collection in Hong Kong January-February 2022) of participants (50+/-17 years of age) with prior vaccination of BNT162b2 (n=10), Coronavac (n=7) (some donors are 1, 2 or 3 dose vaccinated), unvaccinated (n=5) with paired acute (day 0-5) and recovered (1-2 months after illness) samples were tested. Plasma was separated from venous blood and stored at -80\u00b0 C and heat inactivated at 56oC for 30 mins prior to use. The study was approved by the Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong-New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Committee (Ref no: 2020.229), the First A\u0000liated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University Ethics Committee (Ref no: 2018.044) and all participants provided written consent. The third dose vaccine study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong (Ref: UW 21-492), and the of was prepared as previously described23. Brie\u0000y, The RBDs included in this study Clade-2 were custom Bat CoV RaTG13, (Omicron RBD, Acrobiosystems), or produced in house (SARS-CoV-2 plus, and Lambda, Bat CoVs WIV1, Rs2018B, microspheres at 5 \u00b5g RBD protein per use in the sVNT assay. RBD-coated beads (25 \u00b5l, 600 with 25 \u00b5l heat inactivated serum at 1:20, for 15 min at 37\u00b0C with agitation (200 rpm), followed by addition of 50 \u00b5l of PE conjugated human ACE2 (2 mg/ml; Genscript) and incubated for an additional 15 minutes at 37\u00b0C with agitation. After two washes with 1% BSA in 1M NaCl PBS, the \u0000nal readings were using the system (Luminex, array reader v2.6.1, microplate platform v2.1.15, Bio-Plex manager software v6.2.0.175) following manufacturer's instruction. To assess surrogate virus neutralisation the MFI of each RBD bead region was used to calculate : % inhibition=100*(Mean FI of 30 negative pre pandemic samples - individual FI)/Mean FI of 30 negative pre pandemic samples. Percentage inhibition>=20% is typically considered as positive for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody, while percentage inhibition<20 was considered as negative21, as indicated by dotted lines at 20% on most \u0000gures, however sVNT results are shown for all samples including those that are lower than pre-pandemic controls, resulting in some negative values. Plate based sVNT commercial assay For the ancestral and Omicron BA.1 RBD proteins for SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus neutralization test 22 (sVNT) kits (Cat. No.: L00847-A and Z03728) were ordered from GenScript, Inc., NJ, USA. The tests were performed according to the manufacturer's standard protocol. Samples, positive and negative controls were 10 times diluted and then mixed with equal volume of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated SARS-CoV-2 spike mixture was then incubated at 37 oC for 30 min. After incubation, 100ul of the mixture was added to corresponding wells of the capture plate coated with ACE-2 receptor. The plate was sealed and incubated at 37 oC for 30 min. The plated was then emptied and washed with 1X wash solution for 4 times. Residual liquid was removed by tapping dry. 100ul of TMB solution was added to each well and the plate was wrapped with aluminium foil and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 15 min. The reaction was quenched by adding 50ul of stop solution. The absorbance was read at 450nm (OD450) in an ELISA microplate reader. To assess surrogate virus neutralisation the OD450 was used to calculate : % inhibition=100*(1- OD450 value of sample/OD450 value of negative control) PRNT assayPage 12/22The PRNT was performed in duplicate using culture plates (Techno Plastic Products AG, Trasadingen, Switzerland) in a Biosafety level 3 facility. Serial serum dilutions from 1:10 to at least plaque-forming units of SARS-CoV-2 virus for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. The virus-serum mixtures were added on to Vero-E6 cell monolayers and incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The plates were overlaid with 1% agarose in cell culture medium and incubated for 3 days when the plates were \u0000xed and stained. Antibody titres were de\u0000ned as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that resulted in >90% (PRNT90, a more stringent cut-off) or >50% (PRNT50) reduction in the number of plaques. Values below the lowest dilution tested (10) were imputed as 5 and those above 320 were imputed as 640. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 9 software. Statistically signi\u0000cant differences in paired pre- versus post- vaccine responses within vaccine type were determined by Friedmans tests with Dunns multiple comparisons (coloured *). For comparisons between vaccine groups, a Kruskall Wallis test with Dunns multiple comparisons (black analysis toolpack (Excel). RBD cross-reactivity We measure the breadth of antibody responses against different RBDs by calculating the RBD cross- reactivity () in this study. The concept () is borrowed from nucleotide diversity ( ) which provides an unbiased estimate of diversity among groups 30. Speci\u0000cally, the frequencies of positive RBD responses (the number of RBD responses above a 20% inhibition cut-off) were summarized for each RBD/group, and all the negative responses were characterized in a negative group. Then for every group, where samples of RBD/negative responses are observed, RBD cross-reactivity () can be calculated based on pairwise difference between antigens (RBD/negative groups) as where is the total number of all responses. We also calculated the classic Shannon entropy for comparison and the results are comparable, detailed implementation of the diversity measurement can be found via https://github.com/Leo-Poon-Lab/SARS-CoV-2-sVNT-diversity . Correlation between bead sVNT, plate sVNT and viral PRNT responses We calculated the spearman correlation between bead sVNT, plate sVNT and viral PRNT responses when paired data were available. The regression line shown in \u0000gure was approximated by local polynomial regression \u0000tting with span of 10, the corresponding 95% con\u0000dence intervals were shown in grey area. ni i =ijninj N(N1)1 2 NPage 13/22Con\u0000dence intervals For estimating the uncertainty of estimates of RBD cross-reactivity, average %inhibition of responses, (bootstrap percentile intervals) were estimated using bootstrap resampling of 10,000 times.
