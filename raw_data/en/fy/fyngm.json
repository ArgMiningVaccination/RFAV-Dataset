Sodium ascorbyl phosphate, bioflavonoids, liposomal vitamin C and ascorbyl palmitate (a fat-soluble variant of vitamin C used for topical skincare products) are other variants of it, which are stable. Lately, this antioxidant has revolutionised the beauty and wellness industry and has found its way as a star component in everything \u2014 from oils, sunscreens, [serums](https://www.lifestyleasia.com/ind/beauty-grooming/skin/best-vitamin-c-serums-and-creams/) and moisturisers to shampoos and masks.
