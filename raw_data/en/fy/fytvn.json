In early 2023, an adult female victim contacted the Larimer County Sheriff's Office to report being assaulted during treatment performed by Rodney Pereira (DOB 06/07/55). The victim began receiving acupuncture services at Pereira's Loveland home office in mid-2022. In late 2022, he provided massage therapy during a session, during which the victim said he intentionally touched her intimate parts. Pereira represented himself as a retired medical doctor and offered acupuncture and holistic medicine services. Investigators learned that he had never obtained certification as a doctor, and his acupuncture license expired in 2021. Through further interviews, they found that he performed breast examinations despite having no medical training that would qualify him to do so. Following a lengthy investigation, a warrant was issued for Pereira's arrest. He was booked into the Larimer County Jail on August 21 on the following charges: - Sexual Assault - False Medical Exam (F4) - Sexual Contact - Fake Medical Exam (F4) - Acupuncturist - Sexual Intrusion (F4) - Acupuncturist - Sexual Contact (M1) - Unauthorized Practice - Massage Therapy (M2) - Unauthorized Practice - Acupuncture (M2) Pereira was issued a $25,000 cash/surety bond by Magistrate Schwartz. A booking photo is attached. \"Legitimate acupuncture services or massage therapy will never involve sexual contact with clients. This kind of behavior violates legal and ethical requirements for practitioners,\" said Captain Bobby Moll, who leads the Investigations division. \"If this ever happens to you, please report it so law enforcement can stop further harm from happening.\" Anyone with information about this suspect or unreported sexual assault involving him may contact Investigator Ryan Gebhardt at 970-498-5586.
