Much of the research is imperfect, having been conducted with few participants or with only highly motivated people \u2014 those who are able to stick to the diets. Some have claimed the following dietary approaches have helped [people with RA](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/guide/). Seared Salmon With Ros\u00e9 and Herb Pan Sauce Use ros\u00e9 to make a simple pan sauce for seared wild salmon, and then enjoy a glass or two! The salmon cooks quickly, leaving lots of time for ros\u00e9 all day. SERVES 2 CALORIES PER SERVING 527 AUTHOR [The Feedfeed](https://thefeedfeed.com/thefeedfeed) PREP TIME19 min COOK TIME35 min TOTAL TIME56 min Ingredients Directions Cook the rice: Cook rice to desired doneness according to package instructions. Keep warm until ready to serve. Roast the asparagus: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Arrange asparagus on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Roast until lightly caramelized and crisp-tender, about 18 to 20 minutes. Keep warm until ready to serve. Prepare the salmon: Meanwhile, season salmon on both sides with salt and pepper and let sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes. In a coated cast-iron skillet or heavy-bottomed frying pan, add the olive oil and heat over medium high heat until shimmering. Add salmon (skin side up) and halved lemon and cook for about 4 minutes, or until salmon is golden brown and can easily move around the pan. Remove lemon from the pan and set aside on a plate. Flip salmon and cook skin side down for another 3 minutes, then add to the plate with the lemon and tent loosely with foil. Drain olive oil from the skillet and add 1 tbsp of butter. Once melted, add shallot and cook for about 2 minutes or until they start to soften. Deglaze the pan with the ros\u00e9, scraping up brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Bring wine to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until the liquid has reduced by half. Season with salt and pepper, then remove from heat. Add the capers, herbs, and remaining 1 tbsp of butter and mount the sauce by slowly swirling the butter around in the pan. Serve the salmon on top of prepared rice with roasted asparagus and a spoonful of the ros\u00e9 pan sauce.

[prostate cancer risk](https://www.everydayhealth.com/prostate-cancer/guide/). Vegetarian and Vegan Diets for Rheumatoid Arthritis Some people with RA follow a diet that avoids meat (vegetarianism) or even all animal-derived products, including honey and dairy products (veganism). But there isn't much research that shows a positive link between these diets and reduced RA symptoms. [vegan diet](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/vegan-diet-guide-benefits-risks-weight-loss-effect-food-list/)for three weeks, and most of them experienced a drop in their level of C-reactive protein, a marker for inflammation. But the study didn't show a corresponding reduction in RA symptoms. [research](https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/article/40/10/1175/1787820)found that a [gluten](https://www.everydayhealth.com/gluten/guide/)-free [vegan diet](/diet-nutrition/diet/vegan-diet-guide-benefits-risks-weight-loss-effect-food-list/)provided some benefits for people with RA, but the study included only 22 people on the diet. [gluten](/gluten/guide/)-free vegan diet was a little more robust but also featured relatively low numbers of participants. In the research, a group of 38 RA patients ate a gluten-free vegan diet while a control group of 28 people ate a balanced nonvegan (and non-gluten-free) diet. Those on the gluten-free vegan diet experienced a modest improvement in their symptoms and lower levels of [LDL](https://www.everydayhealth.com/high-cholesterol/guide/ldl/)(\"bad\") cholesterol. [deficiencies](https://www.everydayhealth.com/hs/guide-to-essential-nutrients/common-nutrient-deficiencies/), such as a lack of [vitamin B12](https://www.everydayhealth.com/vitamin-b12-deficiency/guide/), protein, and omega-3 fatty acids, which are [bone health](https://www.everydayhealth.com/osteoporosis/guide/). Gluten-Free, Lactose-Free, and Other Elimination Diets for RA Some individuals report benefits when they exclude certain food groups from their diet. This suggests that an allergy or sensitivity worsens RA symptoms. [elimination diets](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/what-is-an-elimination-or-exclusion-diet/)on RA symptoms, and those that do have found mostly short-term benefits. [eliminating specific foods](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/diet/foods-rheumatoid-arthritis-patients-should-avoid/)from their diet, but the study was conducted over a very short period \u2014 six weeks. The research had additional issues, such as inadequate data reporting. [therapy for RA](/hs/rheumatoid-arthritis-treatment-management/complementary-therapies/). [autoimmune protocol](/rheumatoid-arthritis/autoimmune-protocol-diet-aip-diet-ra/)(AIP) diet, focuses on inflammation in the gut, which is thought to be associated with autoimmune disease, including RA. The diet that is thought to heal the immune system and the gut mucosa (lining) is considered by some to be a stricter version of [the paleo diet](/diet-nutrition/the-paleo-diet.aspx). The principal behind this diet is that autoimmune conditions are caused by \"leaky gut.\" On this diet, you eat foods that are rich in nutrients, like meat, fish, and some vegetables, and steer clear of foods that are pro-inflammatory, like grains, dairy, and nightshade vegetables (tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, peppers). Researchers have been examining gut bacteria in an effort to one day identify those people at higher risk for RA. The thought is that if these patients are identified earlier, treatment can begin and there's potential to modify the [gut microbiome](/digestive-health/gut-microbiome/) and improve disease outcomes. [untreated RA](/hs/rheumatoid-arthritis-treatment-management/untreated-ra-risks/)compared with 12 percent of people with chronic, treated RA, leading them to conclude that this bacteria crowds out beneficial microbiota that fight inflammation or itself promotes inflammation. In recent years, the ketogenic (keto) diet \u2014 which is a high-fat, very [low-carb diet](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/low-carb-diet-beginners-guide-food-list-meal-plan-tips/) \u2014 has become popular. While the diet may help people lose weight, experts warn that [the keto diet is bad for RA](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/will-keto-diet-help-ease-joint-pain/) because it's high in fats that promote inflammation and low in grains, fruit, and many vegetables that keep the body in balance and reduce inflammation. Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet for Rheumatoid Arthritis Anecdotal reports indicate that the [Mediterranean diet](https://www.everydayhealth.com/mediterranean-diet/guide/) may help control RA symptoms. Sometimes called [the anti-inflammatory](https://www.everydayhealth.com/hs/rheumatoid-arthritis-pictures/foods-that-fight-inflammation/) or arthritis diet, it's considered the \"ultimate arthritis diet\" for people with RA by the Arthritis Foundation. A look at the components of [the Mediterranean diet](/mediterranean-diet/guide/) would suggest that it has some benefits for RA. For instance, it's high in seafood, a great source of omega-3 fatty acids, as well as heart-healthy olive oil and nutrient-rich vegetables. It's also high in [fiber](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/fiber-benefits-food-sources-supplements-side-effects/), which may be associated with decreased inflammation. [vitamin D](/drugs/vitamin-d)had a lower rate of RA than people who took a placebo. Fasting Diet for Rheumatoid Arthritis [Intermittent fasting (IF)](/diet-nutrition/intermittent-fasting/) which involves eating and fasting on a regular schedule, has become popular recently. Both the safety and the efficacy of committing to periods of fasting are in question. [fasting](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/types-intermittent-fasting-which-best-you/)followed by a [vegetarian diet](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/going-vegetarian-benefits-risks-types-sample-menu/)improved RA pain. Some small studies have shown that restricting calories, as happens during a typical IF diet, may have an anti-inflammatory effect. The exact mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown. One study in [people with rheumatoid arthritis](/rheumatoid-arthritis/guide/) took place during Ramadan, a holiday when religious Muslims fast for 30 days from dawn to dusk (meaning a 12/12 or longer intermittent fast). Do not fast or get your nutrition from juice alone without consulting a physician first. Turmeric, Yogurt, and Other Specific Foods and Herbs to Consume When You Have RA Well-designed studies are still needed to prove or disprove various claims made for specific diets. In the meantime, the most important thing is to be sure your diet is healthy and balanced. Based on their review, they compiled a list of [potential foods to consume](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/food-and-recipes/desserts-fight-inflammation/) and avoid to help with RA. An ideal meal, they found, includes: - Raw or moderately cooked vegetables (lots of greens and legumes) - Seasonal fruits [Probiotic yogurt](https://www.everydayhealth.com/digestive-health/knowgurt-a-guide-to-probiotics-and-yogurt.aspx) - Spices like [turmeric](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/turmeric-curcumin-benefits-side-effects-types-more/)and ginger [Turmeric](/drugs/turmeric)has anti-inflammatory properties, and curcumin, the active ingredient that gives the spice its color, has [analgesic](/analgesic/guide/)effects which may help ease RA symptoms according to research. [cinnamon powder](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/cinnamon-helps-rheumatoid-arthritis-symptoms/)daily for eight weeks, they had a significant decrease in blood levels of C-reactive protein (a marker of inflammation) and a reduction of disease, including less joint swelling and tenderness. [people with RA](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/guide/). The herb has been found to have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties that researchers believe could be therapeutic in treating RA symptoms. Benefits of Taking Specific Supplements [aspirin](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/aspirin)or an [NSAID](/nsaid/guide/). [Other studies have found that some RA patients experience improvements in joint tenderness, swelling, and pain when taking daily supplements of borage oil.](https://www.dl.begellhouse.com/journals/0ff459a57a4c08d0,4a858ba72ec0629d,680117ed238f1e2a.html]) [people with rheumatoid arthritis](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/guide/). The dosage will depend on the type you take. [probiotics](/probiotics/guide/), the beneficial bacteria found in yogurt and other foods as well as supplements, because research has found that people with RA show some improvement with probiotic supplementation. Benefits of Tea for RA Tea, which contains polyphenols, compounds that are packed with antioxidants, may help reduce the risk of inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis. Foods to Avoid When You Have RA Other research found that cutting out soda improved [RA fatigue](/hs/rheumatoid-arthritis-treatment-management/chronic-fatigue/) and other symptoms. Remember to always verify with your healthcare provider and [rheumatologist](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/treatment/how-to-choose-rheumatologist/) that any dietary change is safe for you.
