The [coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)](/topics/covid-19) pandemic has led to the development and approval of vaccines against the responsible virus \u2014 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). More than 100 companies and institutions worldwide have developed vaccine candidates. How do the COVID-19 vaccines differ? Current approved [vaccines](/topics/covid-19-immunisation-and-immunomodulatorsbiologic-agents) rely on a nucleic-acid-based vaccine platform (mRNA) eg, Pfizer/BioNTech + Fosun Pharma, Moderna + National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases - Viral vector platforms eg, AstraZeneca + University of Oxford, Janssen Pharmaceutical - Inactivated virus eg, Sinopharm + China National Biotec Group Co - Protein subunit vaccines eg, Novavax (not yet approved in any country) What are the common types of skin reaction to COVID-19 vaccines? The majority of current literature regarding cutaneous reactions relate specifically to mRNA COVID-19 vaccinations. The spectrum of reported cutaneous reactions after mRNA vaccination include: [Local site reaction](/topics/adverse-cutaneous-reactions-to-vaccines) - Swelling, erythema, and pain in the vaccinated arm. - Median onset of 1 day after vaccination. [Urticaria](/topics/urticaria-an-overview) - Median onset reported on day 2-3 after vaccination. - Common sites include arms (68%), trunk (57%), and legs (46%). - Morbilliform eruptions - Median onset reported on day 2-3 after vaccination. - Common sites include the arm (62%), legs (27%), and trunk (42%). - Delayed large local reaction (\"COVID arm\") - The COVID-19 vaccines may cause a delayed localized hypersensitivity reaction presenting as a pruritic and painful erythematous reaction near the injection site. - Median development of 7 days after vaccine administration with a median duration of 5 days, but can persist for up to 21 days. - Pink plaques are variably oedematous and typically homogenous or less commonly annular. [Sweet syndrome](/topics/acute-febrile-neutrophilic-dermatosis)-like local reactions have been reported. [topical steroids](/topics/topical-steroid), [oral antihistamines](/topics/antihistamines), [Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis](/topics/eosinophilic-pustular-folliculitis)may be triggered by Covid vaccines. How common are cutaneous reactions after COVID-19 vaccination? In one study, cutaneous reactions within 3 days after receiving the vaccine were reported in 1.9% of individuals after receiving their first dose of the mRNA COVID vaccine (Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna). The majority of cutaneous reactions after COVID-19 vaccination occur in women (around 90%). Erythema and itching (other than at the injection site) was the most common cutaneous reaction, which was reported by 1%. In a study (May, 2021) of those with a self-reported cutaneous reaction to the first dose, 95% received their second dose. Among those who completed a symptom survey after the second dose, 83% reported no recurrent cutaneous reactions. However, a different study (July, 2021) reported that 43% of patients receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine who reported first-dose reactions, experienced a second-dose recurrence. What are the uncommon mild skin reactions to COVID-19 vaccines? - Filler reactions - Swelling at the site of cosmetic fillers has been reported after COVID-19 vaccination. Reports have identified patients with facial swelling after both Moderna and Pfizer vaccines associated with prior use of injectable cosmetic filler. - May indicate delayed hypersensitivity to filler following introduction of an immunologic trigger. Similar reactions have been previously noted after other viral illnesses and influenza vaccines. [Erythromelalgia](/topics/erythromelalgia) - Erythromelalgia has also been reported in response to other vaccines such as those for influenza and hepatitis B. [Pernio/chilblains](/topics/chilblains) - Mimics dermatologic manifestations of COVID-19 (COVID toes) - Potentially suggests that the host immune response to the virus is being replicated by the vaccine [Pityriasis rosea](/topics/pityriasis-rosea) - Reported with both COVID-19 infection and COVID-19 vaccines. [Varicella zoster](/topics/chickenpox)and [herpes simplex](/topics/herpes-simplex)flares - Case reports have documented flares following COVID-19 vaccination. [Raynaud phenomenon](/topics/raynaud-phenomenon) - A case has been reported occurring 2 weeks after the COVID-19 vaccine. What are the uncommon serious skin reactions to COVID-19 vaccines? [Bullous pemphigoid](/topics/bullous-pemphigoid) - Relapses of autoimmune bullous disease have been reported - Onset within 3 days - 2 weeks following vaccination. [Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus](/topics/subacute-cutaneous-lupus-erythematosus) - Induction and flares have been reported. - Onset days to weeks following vaccination. - Exacerbation of underlying skin condition - COVID-19 vaccination may trigger exacerbation of a pre-existing inflammatory skin condition such as [psoriasis](/topics/psoriasis)and [atopic dermatitis](/topics/atopic-dermatitis). However, a recent study involving over 2000 individuals did not show that vaccination statistically significantly exacerbated either atopic eczema or psoriasis. - COVID-19 vaccination may trigger exacerbation of a pre-existing inflammatory skin condition such as [Lichen planus](/topics/lichen-planus) - The vaccine leads to increased levels of IL-2, TNF-, and IFN- \u2014 the exact cytokines involved in the development of lichen planus. Reports of this condition following vaccination have been made. [Erythema multiforme](/topics/erythema-multiforme) - Linked to the first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. - It should be noted that major-type EM is considered to be a continuous spectrum with life-threatening toxic anti-epithelial reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis). [pustular flare of psoriasis](/topics/generalised-pustular-psoriasis)associated with an inactivated viral vector COVID-19 vaccine have been published. - A further case report was classified as an overlap between AGEP and [drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)](/topics/drug-hypersensitivity-syndrome)associated with COVID-19 vaccination. - Both [Anaphylaxis](/topics/anaphylaxis) - Rare even with rates of 4.7 cases/million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and 2.5 cases/million doses of the Moderna vaccine - Anaphylaxis to vaccines generally is usually due to individual vaccine components, such as egg protein, gelatin, and other additives. However, the cause of vaccine anaphylaxis with the COVID-19 vaccine cases is unclear, but polyethylene glycol (PEG 2000) is a candidate allergen. - Common signs and symptoms include generalised [urticaria](/topics/urticaria-an-overview), [angioedema](/topics/angioedema), and respiratory and airway obstruction symptoms. - Onset is typically within minutes to hours of administration. Although the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine contains a number of excipients, PEG 2000 is the only one reported to cause anaphylaxis. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine does not contain PEG 2000 so is an alternative for people with a history of allergy to PEG 2000. However, there is occasional cross-reactivity between PEG and polysorbate 80, an ingredient in the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Evaluation by an allergy specialist may be advisable before vaccination in anyone with a suspected PEG allergy. Contraindications for receipt of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines include: - Known history of a severe allergic reaction to any vaccine component, including the excipient PEG 2000 - An allergic reaction to a previous dose of an mRNA vaccine. Identification of risk factors for allergy symptoms after COVID-19 vaccination will guide safe vaccination practices for individuals at the highest risk. How are the COVID-19 skin reactions treated? Severe cutaneous adverse reactions are very rare. The established vaccines have a satisfactory safety profile. Management should be directed at the presenting skin condition, however most of the encountered skin reactions are self-limiting. [Anaphylaxis](/topics/anaphylaxis) requires prompt treatment with intramuscular adrenaline and oxygen. Unlike anaphylaxis, cutaneous adverse reactions alone are not a contraindication to re-vaccination. The available evidence supports that cutaneous reactions to COVID-19 vaccination are generally minor, self-limiting, and should not discourage vaccination. "}
