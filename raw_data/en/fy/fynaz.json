MC number increases in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and blocking MC-derived HA inhibits tumor growth. We have shown that the expression of S TING (s \u0000mulator of interferon gene) expression increases in nude mice (nu/nu) treated with HA and decreases a \u0000er treatment HA-regulated in intra- and extra-hepa \u0000c CCA using 3D spheroid tumors. Methods: In vitro , we generated 3D spheroids lines, Mz-ChA-1 \u0000c), (hHSCs) treatment with H-151 (STING inhibitor, 400 nM), HA (25 mM), cromolyn (25 mM), mepyramine (25 mM) or rani\u0000dine (25 mM), we evaluated by: (i) qPCR the expression of STING, PCNA, VEGFA/C and the EMT markers S100A4 and vimen \u0000n; (ii)EIA kits HA and STING levels in culture (iii) immunofluorescence (IF) STING CK-19 (biliary marker). The same parameters were measured in tumors from nu/nu mice injected with Mz-ChA-1 cells (3 x 106) and treated with HA, cromolyn or HR antagonists. In human CCA obtained from explants, STING expression in MCs, HSCs and cholangiocytes was evaluated chymase, desmin CK-19, respec\u0000vely. Results: STING expression \u0000c CCA, whereas expression increases in intrahepa \u0000c CCA shown by qPCR and western blot. 3D spheroids originated from Mz-ChA-1 or SG231 combined with hMCs, hHSCs or a combina \u0000on and treated with HA had increased: (i) HA and STING levels; (ii) gene expression of STING, PCNA, angiogenesis and EMT markers. Inhibi\u0000on of STING had no e ect on Mz- ChA-1 CCA spheroid phenotypes, whereas blocking STING decreased SG231 CCA phenotypes. When HA/HR signaling was inhibited, both intra- and extra-hepa \u0000c 3D spheroid tumors had reduced (i) HA and STING levels; (ii) gene expression of STING, PCNA, angiogenesis and EMT markers. There was a colocaliza \u0000on of STING with MCs, cholangiocytes and HSCs in nu/nu tumors that increased a \u0000er HA treatment, but decreased when the HA/HR axis was blocked. In human CCA explants, there was increased STING immunoreac\u0000vity in MCs, HSCs and CCA cells compared to controls. Conclusion: There is a dysregula \u0000on of STING signaling in CCA that is regulated by the HA/HR axis. 3D spheroids mimic human CCA tumors and demonstrate a novel technique to study CCA phenotypes.

A driving principle for the KD is the drama \u0000c reduc\u0000on in carbohydrate consump \u0000on to deprive tumors of their preferred energe \u0000c substrate, glucose. The high fat composi\u0000on of the KD leads to the forma \u0000on of ketone bodies which can serve as an alterna \u0000ve fuel for the rest of the body. A signicant challenge for the therapeu\u0000c applica \u0000on of the KD is low pa \u0000ent compliance due to the strict dietary restric\u0000ons and individual intolerance to high fat diets, especially in the context of cancer pa \u0000ents. There is an increasing body of literature on the use of exogenous ketone (EK) supplements to mimic the bene ts of the KD without the strict dietary restric\u0000ons. In a recent study, we reported that the exogenous ketone supplementa \u0000on in a cachec\u0000c was \u0000ng. This study used the immunocompetent VM-M3 model which displays progressive tumor growth, metasta \u0000c spread and severe muscle was \u0000ng. Treatment with the \u0000ssue. To be \u0000er understand the mechanisms by which EKs mi\u0000gated muscle was \u0000ng, we applied mul\u0000-pla \u0000orm metabolomics analysis to the mice used in this study, including (1) sham surgery with no tumor, standard chow, n = 6 (2) VM-M3 tumor hosts on standard chow, n = 7 and (3) VM-M3 tumor hosts on chow supplemented with 1,3-butandiol acetoacetate diester, n = 8. Metabolic proles were collected from serum, muscle and liver \u0000ssue to provide a systems level evalua \u0000on of the eects of the cachexia and the EK supplements. The largest metabolic perturba \u0000ons were associated with the presence of the tumor, but many signicant di erences were observed between the tumor bearing standard chow and EK groups. The use of exogenous ketones provides an alterna \u0000ve fuel source for skeletal muscle leading to a resuscita \u0000on of oxida \u0000ve metabolism in the muscle along with a reduc\u0000on in the catabolism of amino acids. Highly signicant perturba \u0000ons to several metabolites associated with one- carbon metabolism including glycine, methionine and sarcosine were also observed in the EK treated group.

Several pathogene \u0000c mechanisms can contribute to these muscle Mitochondrial altera \u0000ons, altered metabolism and increased oxida \u0000ve stress are known to promote muscle weakness and muscle catabolism. To the extent of improving cachexia, several drugs have been tested to s \u0000mulate mitochondrial func\u0000on and normalize the redox balance. The aim of this study was to test the poten \u0000al bene in combina \u0000on (75 and \u00b5M) exhibited decreased atrophy (+25% vs. vehicle, daily MitoQ administra \u0000on (25mg/kg in drinking water) was able to improve body weight loss (+9% vs. vehicle, p<0.05) in the C26 bearers, without a ec\u0000ng tumor size. Consistently, the C26 hosts displayed ameliorated skeletal muscle mass (+8 and 12% vs. vehicle for TA and GSN respec\u0000vely, p<0.05) and strength (+37% vs. vehicle, p<0.05) upon treatment with MitoQ, whereas the white adipose \u0000ssue (WAT) was only par\u0000ally preserved (+20% vs. vehicle, p=0.06 vs. vehicle).

The TMPRSS2-ERG re-arrangement occurs in ~50% of prostate cancers, resul\u0000ng in aberrant ERG expression. ERG expression can influence cell fate decisions. In di erent models ERG can promote either luminal epithelial fates, or epithelial to mesenchymal transi\u0000on. To determine how ERG promotes specic cell lineages, we performed single cell RNA sequencing of the immortalized normal RWPE-1 cell line. We saw at least four dis \u0000nct cell type popula \u0000ons, including mesenchymal, basal, and luminal progenitor cells. Based on our previous data that ERG cooperates with mAKT to promote luminal di eren \u0000a\u0000on, we suggest that ERG can promote luminal or mesenchymal transi\u0000on, depending on AKT status. We found that TLR4 and VEGF pathways can regulate ERG phosphoryla TLR4 ERG func\u0000on in a cell line, while inhibi\u0000on of VEGF inhibited ERG func\u0000on in a luminal cell line, indica\u0000ng ERG regula \u0000on is cell type dependent. Basic Science FacultyPOSTER #5 INTRINSIC DIFFERENCES IN TARGETED THERAPY-INDUCED FEEDBACK SIGNALING IN CANCER CELLS UNDER PHYSIOXIA VERSUS Adedeji Adebayo1, Nakshatri4,5 1 Department Of Biochemistry And Molecular Biology, Indiana University School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 2 Department Of Surgery, Indiana University School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 3 Department Of Microbiology And Immunology, Indiana University School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 4 Department Of Surgery, Indiana University School Of Medicine, Department Of Biochemistry And Molecular Biology, Indiana University School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 5 VA Roudebush Medical Center Email: akadebay@iu.edu BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies in cancer research are typically carried out following processing and propaga \u0000on of cancer cells in ambient air (~21% oxygen). However, cancer cells reside in microenvironments with signicantly lower oxygen levels. Breast tumors for example, have a median oxygen concentra \u0000on of about 1.3%. Therefore, there is a likelihood that ini\u0000al exposure of cancer cells to excessive amounts of oxygen could impact their behavior and response to targeted therapies (even if they are subsequently cultured in hypoxic condi\u0000ons). The goal of this study was to evaluate cancer cells collected and processed under physioxia (3-5% oxygen) and ambient air (~21% oxygen) in terms of their kinome, di eren \u0000al responses to targeted therapies and poten \u0000al resistance mechanisms to these therapies. METHODS : Tumor \u0000ssues from MMTV-PyMT and MMTV-Her2/Neu+ mice were harvested in physioxia, chopped into bits and split into two por\u0000ons. Each por\u0000on of the tumor \u0000ssues were processed under physioxia and ambient air respec\u0000vely. Tumor frac\u0000ons were derived from the same \u0000ssue to ensure that the dierences observed are due solely to di erences in oxygen tension. The processed tumor cells were then either lysed for Western blo\u0000ng and phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) assay or cultured at oxygen further studies, including drug screening assays. RESULTS: The phospho-RTK array showed an increase in the phosphoryla \u0000on status of EGFR in the cells collected and processed in ambient air compared to physioxia. This was validated via Western blo\u0000ng for phospho-EGFR (Y1068), which also showed a phosphoryla \u0000on status similar to the RTK array.PyMT and Her2/Neu+ tumor cells collected and processed in physioxia were more resistant to Alpelisib (BYL719) and Lapa are PIK3CA A \u0000me course treatment of PyMT and Her2/Neu+ cells collected, processed and propagated in physioxia, with 2\u00b5M Alpelisib showed a signicant resistance to PI3K inhibi\u0000on as indicated by a sustained expression of phospho-AKT (S473), compared to the cells in ambient air which showed a consistent decline. In addi\u0000on, phospho-ERK (T202/Y204) exhibited higher basal expression levels and signicant resistance to PI3K inhibi\u0000on under physioxia compared to the cells in ambient air; a nding that was more signicant in the Her2/Neu+ phosphatase specic for ERK1/2 with an \u0000tumor ac\u0000vity was found to exhibit higher basal levels in the Her2/Neu+ cells in ambient air compared to physioxia. Furthermore, treatment with Alpelisib signicantly induced DUSP5 levels at 2 hours of treatment, with sustained expression levels up to 24 hours of treatment in ambient air. A signicant decrease in DUSP5 expression was observed under physioxia. CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that tumor cells collected, processed and cultured in physioxia exhibit resistance to PI3K inhibi\u0000on poten \u0000ally via an upregula \u0000on of AKT and ERK signaling, despite an observed decrease in EGFR ac\u0000vity.

Lafayette, IN 2 Medicinal Chemistry And Molecular Pharmacology, Purdue University, W. Lafayette, IN Email: ayersm@purdue.edu The success of immunotherapy demands that cytoly \u0000c immune cells be present and ac\u0000vated in a solid tumor mass. Exclusion and suppression of T-lymphocytes are drivers of immunotherapy failure. Our group and others have demonstrated that pharmacological inhibi\u0000on of broblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibits tumor growth through direct inhibi\u0000on of tumor cell prolifera \u0000on, increased recruitment of cytoly \u0000c T-cells, ltra \u0000on of FGFR inhibi\u0000on increases the e cacy of immunotherapy in tumor models of immune-cell exclusion. The mechanism by which FGFR alters the immune in ltrate remains elusive. We analyzed clinical gene expression data in tumors that bear cons \u0000tu\u0000vely ac\u0000vated forms of FGFR and changes T-cell in ltra \u0000on into the tumor, while not e ec\u0000ng suppressor cells. We seek to func\u0000onally validate mechanisms by which FGFR signaling in tumor cells alters immune-cell in ltra such mechanism into the tumor microenvironment. Addi\u0000onally, it has shown that the FDA approved FGFR inhibitor, Erda \u0000nib, has o target e ects toward LCK, which is essen \u0000al to proper T-cell receptor engagement and ac\u0000va \u0000on. Instead, we propose that the FDA approved FGFR inhibitor Pemiga \u0000nib, may provide be \u0000er synergy with immune checkpoint inhibitors when compared to Erda \u0000nib. Understanding these mechanis \u0000c data and determining an FGFR inhibitor that does not hinder T- cell receptor ac\u0000va \u0000on is essen \u0000al to op \u0000mize the combined use of FGFR inhibitors with immunotherapy.

KRASis mutated in ~90% of pa \u0000ents and is the major driver for PDAC progression. Oncogenic KRAS signals downstream e Development of drugs against oncogenic KRAS has been very challenging and highlights the need for alterna \u0000ve strategies to target this signaling pathway. Oncogenic KRAS promotes non-selec\u0000ve uptake of extracellular materials by ac\u0000n driven plasma membrane ruing process. Targe \u0000ng the process of KRAS driven macropinocytosis can be crucial in limi\u0000ng nutri\u0000on to the progressing cells and preven \u0000ng tumor growth. It is shown that core of the pancrea \u0000c tumors is low in crucial nutrients, including glutamine. Pancrea \u0000c tumors scavenge macropinosome forma \u0000on. The process of macropinocytosis is primarily driven through induc\u0000on of EGFR ligands and signaling by EGFR-Pak1 axis in mechanism of macropinosome macropinocytosis is s is known to stabilize Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) at the cell membrane, sugges \u0000ng in membrane PP2A is a heterotrimeric serine/threonine the targets of KRAS: AKT, ERK1/2 and c-Myc. The holoenzyme comprises of A, B and C subunits, where the regulatory B subunit provides substrate specicity to the enzyme. Therapeu\u0000c ac\u0000va of PP2A (SMAP), DT-061 is shown to reduce tumor progression in KRAS driven tumors. To study the role of PP2A in macropinocytosis, we treated a panel of PDAC cell lines with DT-061 and found an induc\u0000on in EGFR ligands expression, DT-061 treatment, consistent with methuosis, a non-apopto\u0000c cell death process driven by excessive macropinocytosis. This nding was con rmed with an increase in the uptake of high molecular weight Dextran by PDAC cells when treated with DT-061. Alterna \u0000vely, stable knockdown of one of B56, showed a \u0000enua \u0000on ndings ac\u0000va \u0000on of PP2A-B56 in late stage PDAC promotes high levels of macropinocytosis, ul\u0000mately leading to cell death.

Thus, there is a cri\u0000cal need to nd novel targets and develop the next-genera \u0000on therapeu\u0000cs to treat MBC. MBC cells not only alter internal signaling pathways, but also interact with external tumor microenvironment (TME) to support their growth, survival and immune escape. These signaling networks contribute to the heterogeneity and plas \u0000city of MBC and lead to therapeu\u0000c failure of targeted therapies and immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs). Blocking the shared key nodes in these signaling networks is an e cient strategy to solve this problem. The aim of the project is to iden \u0000fy a mul\u0000func\u0000onal therapeu\u0000c target in both tumor and immune cells to enhance current therapies with combina \u0000on strategies. Src homology phosphatase with mul\u0000ple roles in tumor cells and TME. In tumor cells, SHP2 is a key signaling sca old protein, and it also interacts with PD-1 in T-cells to reduce cytotoxicity. SHP2 is a druggable target with dis \u0000nct inhibitors, one with allosteric-binding mechanism (SHP099) and another one with an ac\u0000ve-site mechanism (11a-1). However, there is s \u0000ll a mechanis \u0000c knowledge gap in understanding the signaling inputs, outputs and func\u0000ons of SHP2 in the MBC-promo\u0000ng signaling networks. In this study, we used small molecular inhibitors to systemically target SHP2, and manipulate specically in tumor cells. With the comparison between 2D and 3D culture, we found that extracellular matrix signaling ac\u0000vated by bronec\u0000n is one of the signaling inputs of SHP2. Another branch of signaling inputs from mul\u0000ple receptor tyrosine kinase signaling was also con rmed with ligand-dependent growth and signaling assays. These signaling inputs have di eren \u0000al ac\u0000va \u0000on mechanisms. Besides con rming ERK and AKT signaling as the tradi\u0000onal outputs of SHP2, we found that some immune checkpoints on the membrane of tumor cells depend on SHP2 with flow cytometry. To nd be\u0000er model. SHP2 inhibitors decrease pulmonary metastasis and extend the survival of mice. They also synergize with the FGFR inhibitor and ICBs to delayed pulmonary metastasis. In summary, our working model suggests that SHP2 in tumor cell is a mul\u0000func\u0000onal therapeu\u0000cal target with mul\u0000ple signaling inputs and outputs to facilitate metasta \u0000c growth and reprogram tumor microenvironment. The future direc\u0000ons aim to elucidate the detailed mechanisms by which SHP2 regulates tumor microenvironment, and evaluate the e ects of new SHP2 inhibitors in clinical trials.

PDAC pa \u0000ent tumors show high expression levels of mul\u0000ple components of the coagula \u0000on system (e.g., \u0000ssue (uPA) and receptor (uPAR). PDAC is also associated with one of the highest rates of venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared to other solid cancers due to substan \u0000al \u0000ssue factor expression which drives the thrombin. In pancrea \u0000c cancer pathogenesis, thrombin can bind to PAR1 receptors on the cancer cells and can mediate crosstalk between coagula \u0000on and brinolysis through ac\u0000va pathway ac\u0000va \u0000on of plasmin from its precursor, plasminogen (Plg), which then contributes to cancer metastasis. We hypothesized that targe \u0000ng the PA (uPA/uPAR) system would disrupt tumor progression. Our group has been characterizing the e ects of knocking out components of the PA pathway on tumor growth and metastasis. Using pancrea \u0000c cancer cell lines from the gene \u0000cally engineered mouse model KPC (K-rasLSL.G12D/+; p53R172H/+; PdxCre), the brinoly (uPA and uPAR) have been eliminated technology. To inves \u0000gate the contribu\u0000on of uPA/uPAR system in the tumor, KPC cells depleted of uPA and uPAR were injected into mice. The knockout tumors were signicantly smaller than Cas9 control tumors. To inves \u0000gate the contribu\u0000on of uPA/uPAR system in the and Plg specic \u0000sense oligonucleo\u0000de (Plg-ASO) treatment plasminogen levels in mice. Orthotopic injec\u0000on of KPC cells in Plg-/- mice had signicantly a \u0000enuated tumor growth compared to WT mice. To analyze if our ndings can be extended to models u\u0000lizing human cells, we tested our hypothesis using human derived Pa02C and Pa03C PDAC cells. Treatment with Plg-ASO signicantly reduced tumor growth of two human Pa03C and Pa02C PDAC cells in a subcutaneous Pa03C orthotopic model, we conrmed the signicant decrease in tumor growth within the pancreas following treatment with Plg-ASO and bioluminescence imaging showed a signicant decrease in metasta \u0000c burden compared to Control-ASO. In conclusion, our data suggests a mechanism involving the thrombin-PA system driving tumor progression and metastasis through uPA/uPAR via plasminogen. To clarify the role of Plg and PA in PDAC metastasis, we will analyze their expression in pa \u0000ent tumor samples and correlate expression with disease stage and incidence of VTE. We are collec\u0000ng \u0000ssue biopsies of both male and female pa \u0000ents who are in various disease stages and corresponding blood samples from all these pa \u0000ents and analyzing the plasma for coagula \u0000on factors and VTE markers to examine the correla \u0000on between disease stage and therapy.

One transporter, SLC3A2 (4F2), is a key SLC gene induced by GCN2 and is essen \u0000al for PCa prolifera \u0000on. SLC3A2 engages with many nutrient transporters, allowing for their localiza \u0000on to the plasma membrane. Importantly, expression of SLC3A2 reduced GCN2 ac\u0000va \u0000on and rescued growth inhibi\u0000on of GCN2-depleted PCa cells. Our results indicate that select amino acid limita \u0000ons ac\u0000vate GCN2 in PCa, resul\u0000ng in the of key amino acid transporters, including 4F2 (SLC3A2), which provide for nutrient import to facilitate protein synthesis and metabolism required for PCa progression. We conclude that GCN2 and the ISR are promising therapeu\u0000c targets for both androgen-sensi\u0000ve and castra \u0000on-resistant prostate cancer. Basic Science Graduate StudentPOSTER DEFINING MECHANISMS OF TGLI1'S ONCOGENIC FUNCTIONS Haddie DeHart1, Richard Carpenter2 1 Cell, Molecular And Cancer Biology PhD Program , Indiana University School Of Medicine, Bloomington, IN 2 Medical Sciences Program, Biochemistry And Molecular Biology, Indiana University School Of Medicine, Bloomington, IN Email: hkdehart@iu.edu Truncated of GLI1 in which a por\u0000on of the N-terminal region is lost. Despite the loss of 41 amino acids, TGLI1 operates as a gain of func\u0000on transcrip \u0000on factor with the ability to bind to and ac\u0000vate genes dis \u0000nct from GLI1. In doing so, TGLI1 promotes invasion, migra \u0000on, angiogenesis, and stemness in both breast cancer and glioblastoma (GBM). Currently, the mechanisms behind the di eren \u0000al binding of TGLI1 from GLI1 remain unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we inves \u0000gated protein-protein interac\u0000ons of TGLI1 and that TGLI1 and GLI1 have dis \u0000nct protein interac\u0000ons, which may mediate the unique gene binding prole of TGLI1. However, further inves \u0000ga\u0000on into changes in protein interac\u0000ons and other mechanisms in fluencing TGLI1 DNA binding, is needed. The expression of TGLI1 in breast cancer and GBM drives cells towards a more stem like state. Recently, it was shown that breast cancer stem cells expressing TGLI1 are capable of ac\u0000va \u0000ng astrocytes to promote breast cancer metastasis to the brain. While GBM stem cells (GSCs) have been shown to ac\u0000vate astrocytes, the role of TGLI1 in this has been linked to increased prolifera \u0000on, invasion, immune evasion, and chemoresistance in GBM. As TGLI1 has been shown to drive a more aggressive cancer phenotype, these studies will be crucial in delinea \u0000ng the exact behaviors of the TGLI1 protein that promote cancer progression.

It's non-essen \u0000al MED25 subunit can interact oncogenic transcrip \u0000on factors have established roles in both breast and prostate cancer. While others have demonstrated that the MED25-ETV5 interac\u0000on promotes ETV5 disrup \u0000on of these interac\u0000ons have yet to be evaluated at a phenotypic level in prostate cancer. I have demonstrated that knockdown of MED25 protein does not in fluence cellular migra in vitro . Our lab has shown that exogenous expression of ETV1/4 promotes migratory phenotypes in the normal prostate RWPE1 cell line. To address the role of MED25-ETV interac\u0000ons in promo\u0000ng migra \u0000on, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of MED25 will rst be achieved in RWPE1 cells. This will be followed by rescue with mutant MED25, harboring muta \u0000ons in its ac\u0000vator-interac\u0000ng domain (ACID) that specically prevent its interac\u0000ons with ETV. I also plan to achieve MED25 knockout in PC3 prostate cancer cells with high expression of ETV4, as well as in COP1-KO LNCAP prostate cancer cells with stable ETV1 expression. Interac\u0000ons will be evaluated by a nity pulldown using puried HIS-tagged ETS proteins and cell lysates from these DMED25 cells. Upon expression of ETV1/4/5 in DMED25 RPWE1 cells, ChIP-seq of ETV and Pol II will be implemented to evaluate if the MED25-ETV interac\u0000ons are required for Pol II recruitment to sites of ETV-chroma \u0000n binding. If these results support the hypothesis that MED25-ETV interac\u0000ons are required for expression of genes involved in cancer cell migra \u0000on, I plan to evaluate the e cacy of nors \u0000c\u0000c acid in prostate cancer cell lines. This allosteric regulator of MED25 was recently studied for clinical use in triple nega \u0000ve breast cancer and is thought to act by binding the ACID domain of MED25. Extending this knowledge could provide therapeu\u0000c bene t to pa \u0000ents whose prostate tumors present high expression of ETV transcrip \u0000on factors. Basic Science Graduate StudentPOSTER #14 ERG PARTICIPATES IN TWO DISTINCT INTERACTIONS WITH CO-ACTIV ATOR EWS Benjamin Greulich1, Taylor Nicholas2, Peter Hollenhorst1 1 Medical Sciences, School Of Medicine, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN 2 Department Of Biology, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN Email: bmgreuli@iu.edu Prostate cancer is responsible for the second most cancer-related deaths in American men. A hallmark of this disease is the gene fusion between the promoter of an androgen-driven gene and an ETS transcrip \u0000on factor. The most common fusion is TMPRSS2-ERG , which results in expression of ERG and subsequently increased migra \u0000on and tumor growth. While ERG is the most common oncogenic ETS factor to become expressed in prostate cancer, accoun \u0000ng for approximately 50% of cases, fusions can also occur with ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5. Our lab has shown these four proteins share a unique ability among the ETS family to interact with a co-ac\u0000vator EWS. An understanding of this interac\u0000on can reveal new therapeu\u0000c targets to inhibit oncogenic ETS factors in prostate cancer. Interac\u0000on assays using puried ERG and EWS fragments have shown a direct interac\u0000on between ERG and the N-terminus of EWS, and this interac\u0000on is dependent on ERG's proline 436. ERG can also interact with the chimeric protein EWS/FLI1, which is responsible for the development of Ewing's Sarcoma. However, ERG fails to interact with YS37 EWS/FLI1, in which 37 tyrosines are mutated to serine, thus abolishing its ability to phase separate. This indicates that this direct interac\u0000on is dependent on EWS' intrinsically disordered region and might occur within the context of a phase separated droplet. A weaker interac\u0000on between ERG and the C-terminus of EWS (ctEWS) has also been observed in cell extracts but not with puried protein, indica \u0000ng this interac\u0000on to be indirect. This ERG-ctEWS interac\u0000on is independent of ERG's proline 436, but may be dependent on RNA. This RNA-dependence seems logical, as ctEWS contains mul\u0000ple nucleic acid binding domains. To determine addi\u0000onal factors that facilitate this indirect interac\u0000on, IP-mass spectrometry was performed and revealed interac\u0000ng partners that overlap with ERG IP-mass spectrometry data. One hit has been con rmed to interact with ERG and ctEWS via co-immunoprecipita \u0000on. In addi\u0000on to ERG, ETV1 also appears to interact with this IP-mass spec hit. Ongoing experiments aim to determine if the interac\u0000on between this hit and ERG or ctEWS is direct and to determine which region of ERG is required for this interac\u0000on. Addi\u0000onally, knockdown cell lines are being constructed to determine if the IP-mass spec hit is required for the ERG-ctEWS interac\u0000on or ERG func\u0000on. Taken together, these data have led us to hypothesize that ERG and EWS are involved in a higher order, poten \u0000ally phase-separated structure that is required for ac\u0000va \u0000on of ERG transcrip \u0000onal targets. Con\u0000nued work to de ne this complex can provide new therapeu\u0000c targets or approaches to targe \u0000ng ERG in prostate cancer. Basic Science Graduate StudentPOSTER #15 INDUCED ENDOREPLICATION BY AURORA B KINASE INHIBITION AS A MODEL FOR TUMOR HETEROGENEITY Kelly Brian Calvi2, Claire E. Walczak1 1 Medical Sciences, Bloomington, IN 2 Biology, Bloomington, IN Email: khartso@iu.edu Endoreplica \u0000on is an alterna \u0000ve cell cycle wherein cells undergo alterna \u0000ng G and S phases without dividing. While endoreplica \u0000on can occur naturally to generate polyploid cells in growth and development, it can also be co-opted by cancer cells, leading to genome instability, tumor evolu\u0000on, and cancer relapse; however, the mechanisms leading to these outcomes are unknown. We developed a cell culture method to generate induced endoreplica \u0000ng cells (iECs) from diploid RPE-1 cells by trea \u0000ng cells with cell cycle inhibitors to study how changes in cell cycle dynamics lead to genomic heterogeneity and how cells with increased ploidy return to division. We found that Aurora B kinase inhibi\u0000on resulted in a subtype of endoreplica \u0000on called endomitosis, wherein cells enter mitosis but do not divide. Cells treated with a high concentra \u0000on of Aurora B inhibitor failed at the metaphase/anaphase transi\u0000on, resul\u0000ng in daughter cells with mul\u0000-lobed nuclei. In contrast, cells treated with a lower concentra \u0000on of Aurora B inhibitor failed at cytokinesis and resulted in binucleate cells. We found that cells with mul\u0000-lobed nuclei preferen \u0000ally undergo DNA synthesis, sugges \u0000ng that nuclear phenotype and/or the level of Aurora B inhibi\u0000on may play a cri\u0000cal role in determining whether a cell can bypass the tetraploid checkpoint to become polyploid. To understand the molecular pathways contribu\u0000ng to endoreplica \u0000on, we performed RNA-seq on iECs and found that there was an increase in the senescence-associated secretory phenotype signature and core senescence genes. Using fluorescence microscopy, we found that some, but not all, cells were posi\u0000ve for senescence markers, sugges \u0000ng the response to Aurora B inhibi\u0000on is heterogeneous. To ask whether polyploid iECs can resume prolifera \u0000on, iECs were flow-sorted based on DNA content and plated in the absence of inhibitor. A\u0000 er an ini\u0000al lag phase, a subset of cells began to rapidly proliferate and form colonies of mito\u0000cally dividing cells. We are currently assessing why only some cells return to division, and if senescence is a determinant factor. We are also re- expressing genes downregulated in iECs to ask if we can establish a gene re-expression network that s\u0000mulates return to division. Our studies provide a poten \u0000al model for tumor heterogeneity that will help dene molecular mechanisms that lead to endoreplica \u0000on and promote return to division, and may provide new insights into how cancer cells evade normal cell cycle control.

Conversely, knockdown of DYRK1A in apoptosis, \u0000ng that DYRK1A confers cancer cell resistance by desensi\u0000zing cells to apoptosis signals. Furthermore, breast cancer transcriptome analysis has shown DYRK1A to be consistently and signicantly deregulated in triple nega \u0000ve breast cancers. These ndings suggest that development of a selec\u0000ve, potent DYRK1A inhibitor could have far reaching clinical applica \u0000ons in an \u0000cancer therapies. However, while a \u0000empts have been made to modulate DYRK1A ac\u0000vity using chemotherapeu\u0000cs, a non-toxic, selec\u0000ve inhibitor remains elusive. molecular modeling studies of the toxic DYRK1A inhibitor harmine, we developed new classes of N-heterocyclic DYRK1A ac\u0000ve site inhibitors. Compound libraries were generated for seven core structures based on their predicted DYRK1A ATP-binding site interac\u0000ons. We report the discovery of three new classes of DYRK1A inhibitors a\u0000er in vitro and in vivo evalua \u0000on of the compound libraries. ELISA assays for human recombinant DYRK1A revealed that the vivo model system substan \u0000ated the in vitro results, and the resul\u0000ng correspondence validates generated classes as architectural mo\u0000fs that serve as poten \u0000al DYRK1A inhibitors. The unique sca old design of these DYRK1A inhibitors allows for modiable sites to enable future explora \u0000on of a \u0000achment groups that confer high selec\u0000vity, high potency, and low toxicity. Further expansion and analysis of these core compound structures will allow discovery of safe, more e ec\u0000ve chemical inhibitors of DYRK1A to serve as a new therapeu\u0000c approach for an \u0000cancer therapies. Basic Science Graduate StudentPOSTER #17 CAN DEEP LEARNING UNCOVER LOST TRAJECTORIES FROM NOISY FLUORESCENT IMAGES? Fadil Iqbal1 1 Department Of Physics, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, IN Email: fadiqbal@iu.edu Artificial Intelligence has a new member: Deep Learning (DL) - which is a powerful tool capable of recognizing patterns. It has shown promise in restoring noisy fluorescent images. Noisy fluorescent images are a result of low exposure time - where it is important to reduce the photo-toxicity when imaging cells. However noisy images are also present when performing particle tracking on fast moving molecules. The exact position of these molecules are required to construct a trajectory but as we go for higher imaging speeds, the exposure time reduces and noise increases. This makes it hard to do any tracking. Our study has verified the capability of two DL packages which are capable of restoration in two ways: supervised and unsupervised. We applied them to the following examples: 1. A synthetic bead model where noise can be added artificially - we were able to restore low SNR movies and restore their individual trajectories by both supervised and unsupervised methods. 2. Experimentally we applied these techniques on nucleosomes and chromatin microdomains, to verify if deep learning can restore stationary and dynamic data. It was noted that the supervised approach delivered better results. However there are instances where these algorithms produce deceiving results, despite 'looking good' to the naked eye. We anticipate broad application of this approach to critically evaluate artificial intelligence solutions for quantitative microscopy .

Among family members, Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) promote cachexia and pancrea \u0000c cancer. However, less is known of the related Oncosta \u0000n M, which has func\u0000ons in in flamma \u0000on, brosis, metabolism, and hematopoiesis. OSM is expressed by blood cells and is elevated in in flamma \u0000on while OSMR is ubiquitously expressed. OSM can induce IL-6 secre \u0000on by binding OSM receptor (OSMR). Here we show that high expression of OSMR in tumor correlated with poor overall survival in pa \u0000ents with pancrea \u0000c cancer and that OSM was elevated in a mouse model of pancrea caused local muscle atrophy and brosis, systemic bone loss, and cardiac dysfunc\u0000on in non- cancerous mice, sugges \u0000ng OSM could mediate and musculoskeletal e ects in pancrea \u0000c cancer cachexia independent of IL-6. We hypothesized that inhibi\u0000on of OSM and OSMR would protec\u0000ve in 14-week-old WT, KrasG12D;Trp53R172H;Pdx1:Cre pancrea \u0000c tumor cell line, KPC32043, and followed for echocardiography, weight change, and body composi\u0000on by EchoMRI. All groups were euthanized when one reached 5% fat mass. Cardiac dysfunc\u0000on was detected earlier in Osm-/- KPC mice versus WT KPC mice, with increased ejec\u0000on frac\u0000on and frac\u0000onal shortening in the absence of cardiac was \u0000ng. At euthanasia, OSM plasma levels were elevated in WT and Osmr-/-KPC mice compared to sham but minimally detected in Osm-/- mice. There were no di erences in terminal cardiac, skeletal muscle or fat was \u0000ng among WT, Osm-/-, Osmr-/- KPC mice. There were no di erences in splenomegaly, organ was \u0000ng, or tumor size across genotypes. However, tumors from Osm-/- mice showed reduc\u0000on in the stromal cell compartment and tumors from Osm-/-and Osmr-/- mice had altered tumor proteomes as well as altered histological phenotypes in both tumor cells and cancer associated broblasts. These data indicate that OSM signaling via OSMR in fluences cardiac adapta \u0000on to cancer and modulates tumor aggressiveness in pancrea \u0000c cancer but is not necessary for cachexia. Basic Science Graduate StudentPOSTER #19 INVESTIGATING THE ROLE OF THE KINESIN-14 TAIL DOMAIN IN CENTROSOME CLUSTERING Emily Jones1, Walczak2 1 IU School Of Medicine-Bloomington, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN 2 IU School Of Medicine-Bloomington, Bloomington, IN 3 Biology, Bloomington, IN Email: jonesemj@iu.edu Centrosome amplica \u0000on is a hallmark of cancer that correlates with poor outcomes. Cells with centrosome amplica \u0000on form mul\u0000polar spindles, which lead to mul\u0000polar cell divisions and lethal levels of aneuploidy. However, many cancer cells have the ability to cluster centrosomes and form bipolar spindles, which enhances cell survival. Kinesin-14 proteins are important for centrosome clustering and are o\u0000 en amplied in many tumors. Inhibi\u0000on of Kinesin-14 proteins in cancer cells with centrosome amplica \u0000on leads to cell death; however, Kinesin-14s are essen \u0000al in normal cells. Therefore, targe \u0000ng Kinesin-14s could provide a novel mechanism to selec\u0000vely kill cancer cells without harming normal cells. Kinesin-14s are molecular motors that cross-link and slide both parallel and an \u0000-parallel microtubules. Because microtubules near centrosomes are organized in a parallel manner, we hypothesize that the parallel microtubule cross-linking ac\u0000vity is cri\u0000cal for centrosome clustering. Previous work our lab showed that Kinesin-14s can cross- link microtubules using their ATP-dependent kinesin-like motor domain and a second microtubule domain in the tail domain. How a single microtubule binding domain in the tail could be involved in cross-linking of microtubules of opposite polarity is not known. To address this ques \u0000on, we mapped the regions of the tail that are important for microtubule binding and found two independent microtubule binding domains, which we named MBD1 and MBD2. Biochemical analysis of these domains supports would thus be cri\u0000cal for centrosome clustering. To test this idea in cells, we are currently doing knockdown/rescue experiments using wild-type and mutant Kinesin-14s to ask \u0000on of impacts centrosome clustering. In addi\u0000on, an analysis of cBioPortal revealed that most pa \u0000ents with altera \u0000ons in KifC1 (Kinesin-14 in humans) are amplica \u0000ons of the gene, a small number of pa \u0000ents have muta \u0000ons in highly conserved in MBD1. We postulate that muta \u0000ons in MBD1 will reduce an \u0000- parallel microtubule cross-linking and cause a commensurate increase in parallel microtubule cross-linking, leading to an increase in centrosome clustering, an idea that we are currently tes \u0000ng. Understanding the mechanisms by which Kinesin-14s cluster centrosomes will enable us to develop novel inhibitors that have the poten \u0000al to treat cancers with centrosome amplica Graduate StudentPOSTER #20 BINDING PROTEINS AS TRANSCRIPTIONAL CO-ACTIV ATORS IN FUSION POSITIVE CANCERS Renee Kinne1 1 Medical Sciences , Indiana University Bloomington, Bloomington, IN Email: rekinne@iu.edu Chromosomal transloca \u0000ons that result in gene fusions are a common cause of cancer. In par\u0000cular, gene fusions involving transcrip \u0000on factors are found in mul\u0000ple cancers such as Ewing's sarcoma and renal-cell carcinoma. A commonality between these fusion proteins is that the transcrip \u0000on factors are fused to intrinsically disordered RNA binding proteins (ID-RBP). The intrinsically disordered regions of ID-RBPs allow them to bind together and form phase separated granules. In these fusion proteins, the ID-RBPs act as co- ac\u0000vators leading to oncogenic transcrip \u0000on but the mechanism for this ac\u0000va \u0000on is not fully known. Part of this ac\u0000va \u0000on may involve the paraspeckle, a nuclear phase-separated body that has an RNA sca old. Many of the ID-RBPs found in these gene fusions are essen \u0000al proteins for paraspeckle forma \u0000on and func\u0000on, making transcrip \u0000on. To inves \u0000gate the mechanism, ID-RBPs will be cloned together with transcrip \u0000on factors they are not naturally found fused with and expressed in normal prostate cells. These fusions will be examined for oncogenic a ects through such as migra \u0000on. presence and composi\u0000on can then be examined by fluorescent imaging. This study will contribute to our understanding of gene targe \u0000ng and ac\u0000va \u0000on based on protein ability to phase separate. This research could also further our understanding of the paraspeckles' poten \u0000al role in cancer.

IBD is characterized by the chronic in flamma \u0000on of the gastrointes \u0000nal tract coli\u0000s. IBD can be very debilita \u0000ng and puts people at higher risk of developing other diseases such as colorectal cancer. Current therapeu\u0000cs include broad-ac\u0000ng an \u0000- inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs. These therapeu\u0000cs can induce remission, but many pa \u0000ents do not respond to therapy or experience relapses, indica \u0000ng a need for new and more targeted therapies. Despite the prevalence, much is s \u0000ll unknown about IBD, including the role of epithelial cell types in colon inflamma \u0000on. One cell type of poten \u0000al importance in flamma \u0000on and IBD cells (EECs). EECs \u0000ng \u0000on and mo\u0000lity, but other characteris \u0000cs of EECs suggest they may play an important role in in flamma \u0000on. For example, EECs express innate immune receptors and microbial metabolite receptors, sugges \u0000ng EECs may be key in driving the inflammatory response to microbial pathogens, a common source of in flamma \u0000on in the colon. Furthermore, EECs have been found to be increased in pa \u0000ents with IBD and posi\u0000vely correlated with markers of inflamma \u0000on, which suggests that EECs are a cell type with clinical relevance in IBD. Despite noted features of EECs and correla \u0000ve data in IBD, much is s \u0000ll unknown about EECs in in flamma \u0000on including what inflammatory pathways are enriched in EECs and how in flammatory pathways may a ect EEC di eren \u0000a\u0000on. The JAK/STAT pathway is typically considered for its role in immunity, but it also has established roles in cell dieren \u0000a\u0000on. STAT3 for example has been implicated in of spermatogonia and pancrea \u0000c endocrine in both the role of STAT3 in cell di eren \u0000a\u0000on centered around its ability to increase expression transcrip \u0000on factor NEUROG3 STAT3 and EEC di eren \u0000a\u0000on in the colon has not yet been established. Using a combina \u0000on of physiologically relevant human colon organoids and the HT29 colon cancer cell line, both of which contain the major cell types found in the colon, I provide evidence that supports a role for EECs in promo\u0000ng the transcrip \u0000onal in flammatory response to the microbial irritant LPS, and present support for STAT3 in promo\u0000ng the di eren \u0000a\u0000on of EECs. Moving forward I plan to use scRNA-seq to further inves \u0000gate the role of EECs in the transcrip \u0000onal in flammatory response to LPS and the role of STAT3 in EEC dieren \u0000a\u0000on and ATAC-seq to determine if the EEC mediated in flammatory response is due to regions of open chroma \u0000n that are unique to EECs.

Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms which drive MBC remain incomplete. Epithelial-mesenchymal transi\u0000on (EMT) and mesenchymal-epithelial transi\u0000on (MET) promote drug resistance and metastasis. It has been reported that broblast growth receptor 1 (FGFR1) plays a key role during the EMT: MET cycle. Furthermore, FGFR1 is amplied in 13% of breast cancer pa \u0000ents. Therefore, op \u0000mizing inhibi\u0000on of FGFR1 is crucial therapeu\u0000c targe \u0000ng of late-stage breast cancer. Herein, we examined cacies of FGFR kinase inhibitors FGFR kinase ac\u0000vity leads to tumor growth inhibi\u0000on but fails to eradicate dormant breast cancer cells. Therefore, we explored broader approaches to inhibit FGFR1 expression in addi\u0000on to blockade of its kinase ac\u0000vity. G-quadruplex (G4) is an emerging target for cancer therapies. Small molecules interact with and stabilize G4s formed in the promoters of oncogenes, e ec\u0000vely blocking the expression of cri\u0000cal cancer-related genes. Examina expressing, metasta \u0000c and drug-resistant approach resulted in drama \u0000c downregula \u0000on of FGFR1 at the protein level a \u0000er treatment. G4 stabilizing agents also interfere with ectopic FGFR1 expression and EMT- driven FGFR1 expression. Importantly, use of the clinical G4-targe \u0000ng compound CX-5461 e ec\u0000vely blocked FGFR1 FGFR1 downstream signaling, resul\u0000ng in eradica \u0000on of dormant breast cancer cells. Finally, in vivo applica \u0000on of CX-5461 reduced FGFR1 expression, blocked pulmonary tumor forma \u0000on, and prolonged animal survival.

Both ADAR1 and ADAR2 are essen \u0000al for normal neurological func\u0000on and are associated with several pathologies including cancer, Alzheimer's, epilepsy and Aicardi-Gou\u0000\u00e8res syndrome (AGS). Hence, extensive research has been directed towards understanding gene regulatory func\u0000ons of the ac\u0000ve deaminases. On the contrary, despite being discovered two decades ago, the physiological role of the brain-specic, deaminase-de cient ADAR family member, ADAR3, is largely unknown. Loss of ADAR3 leads to altered gene expression proles and is associated with learning and memory deciencies in mice. Literature also demonstrates that ADAR3 is capable of binding both single and double stranded RNA molecules. However, molecular targets of ADAR3 and the mechanism underlying how ADAR3 binding to target transcripts in fluence gene expression proles are s \u0000ll unknown. Addi\u0000onally, the signicance behind why glioblastoma \u0000ssue samples have elevated ADAR3 protein expression when compared to adjacent normal \u0000ssues is s \u0000ll elusive. Our central hypothesis is that ADAR3 regulates glioblastoma progression through directly binding to target transcripts and modula \u0000ng the tumor transcriptome and/or proteome by localiza \u0000on. In regard, a high-throughput was employed in U373 glioblastoma cells to iden \u0000fy transcripts bound by endogenous ADAR3. We found that ADAR3 binds 1435 RNA targets of which almost 30% are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).

The ve-year survival rate of angiosarcoma is 30%. Due to the rarity of angiosarcoma, there is a lack of understanding of the drivers of the disease and novel therapeu\u0000c targets. MicroRNAs are short, non-coding RNAs that regulate messenger RNAs, and have many important cellular func\u0000ons. Dysregula \u0000on of miRNAs has been shown to contribute to many diseases, including cancer. Although miRNAs have been explored extensively in other cancers, research into their role in angiosarcoma is limited. We are currently inves \u0000ga\u0000ng the role of miR-497-5p in angiosarcoma. Of several microRNAs proposed to be dysregulated in angiosarcoma, we found that miR-497-5p most signicantly and consistently suppressed cell viability in angiosarcoma cell lines. To determine the mechanisms and targets responsible for this phenotype we u\u0000lized a combinatorial approach with RNA-seq and target predic\u0000on algorithms. Based on this we have iden \u0000ed four candidate target genes that are downregulated in our cell lines as a result of miR-497 mimic transfec\u0000on, predicted to be direct targets of miR-497-5p, and are upregulated in human angiosarcoma. miR-497 target gene valida \u0000on and mechanis \u0000c studies on these target genes are ongoing.

Misregulation of RBPs contributes to pathogenic gene expression programs by influencing regulatory processes such as RNA modification, splicing, stability, localization, and translational efficiency. RBPs known as ADARs are required for normal neurological function, and altered ADAR function is associated with several pathologies such as cancer, autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases. ADARs regulate one of the most abundant RNA modifications in humans, the conversion of adenosine to inosine, also referred to as A-to-I editing. In humans, there are three ADAR family members, ADAR1, ADAR2, and ADAR3. While ADAR3 is a member of the ADAR family of RNA editors due to a shared domain structure, ADAR3 lacks editing activity. However, ADAR3 is known to repress ADAR2-mediated editing of one essential neuronal transcript in glioblastoma cells. Recent studies also demonstrated increased expression of ADAR3 protein in glioblastoma tumors compared to adjacent normal tissue. However, the cellular targets and molecular function of ADAR3 in glioblastoma are largely unknown. In this study, we performed a transcriptome-wide analysis to determine RNA targets of ADAR3 and the effects of ADAR3 on RNA editing in the U87 glioblastoma cell line. High-throughput sequencing analysis indicates that ADAR3 binds to over 3300 transcripts, and around 60% of ADAR3 targets were also previously found to be bound by ADAR1. ADAR3 expression resulted in differential editing of > 200 sites, with approximately 70% of sites exhibiting reduced editing. Around 58% of differentially edited sites were within transcripts bound by ADAR3, suggesting that most of the ADAR3 effects on editing might be caused by binding to specific transcripts. The majority of these differentially edited sites are located in 3' untranslated regions and were previously found to be catalyzed by ADAR1, indicating that ADAR3 acts as a negative regulator of ADAR1- mediated editing. Inhibition of ADAR1 editing by ADAR3 was investigated in one important, shared transcript encoding the essential innate immune response pathway gene, MAVS. Overexpression of ADAR3 and knockdown of ADAR1 results in reduced editing in the MAVS 3'UTR, leading to upregulation of MA VS protein without altering mRNA level. ADAR3 deaminase domain mutants with altered binding and editing activity were used to investigate the mechanism by which ADAR3 regulates editing and substrate selectivity. Together, this study provides insights into ADAR3- mediated regulation of ADAR1 editing activity and gene expression during normal development as well as in glioblastoma.

These studies suggest that suppression of PP2A ac\u0000vity may be important in PDAC maintenance. The ac\u0000ve holoenzyme consists of the cataly \u0000c subunit (C), and the subunit (B). There are 20+ di erent B subunits that can be incorporated into the PP2A holoenzyme. The diversity of B subunits is responsible for substrate specicity. While global PP2A nega \u0000vely regulate cellular transforma \u0000on and has decreased expression in PDAC, indica \u0000ng that B56 suppression may aid in PDAC tumorgenicity. Therefore, there is a cri\u0000cal need to understand the mechanisms that alter PP2A func\u0000on and substrate targe \u0000ng. Our research aims the impact of oncogenic KRAS on PP2A-B56 ac\u0000vity and how suppression of B56 impacts the ini\u0000a\u0000on and progression of PDAC. Our preliminary studies suggest that induc\u0000on of KRASG12D increases the expression of cancerous inhibitor of PP2A (CIP2A), indica \u0000ng that PP2A suppression may be an early event in PDAC ini\u0000a \u0000on. Consistent with this hypothesis, our in vivo data show that the loss of B56 in the context mutant KRAS accelerates PDAC ini\u0000a \u0000on, increasing the forma \u0000on inhibitors to further understand how suppression of PP2A-B56 contributes to development of PDAC.

Persistence of OC stem cells (OCSCs) is believed to contribute to resistance to pla \u0000num-based chemotherapy and disease relapse. Long non-coding RNA HOXC transcript an \u0000sense RNA (HOTAIR) has been shown to be associated with chemoresistance and overexpressed in many types of cancers, including high-grade serous OC (HGSOC). Previously published work has \u0000ng stem cell markers, CD44, CD133, and ALDH1 has been demonstrated but not well de ned in OC.

Basic Science Graduate StudentPOSTER #29 INVESTIGATING MCAK AND KIF18B AS NEW CANDIDATES Stephanie Ems-McClung2, Claire Walczak2 1 Biology, Indiana University - Bloomington, Bloomington, IN 2 Medical Sciences, Bloomington, IN Email: winnj@iu.edu Chromosome instability is a hallmark of many tumors and leads to aneuploid daughter cells. In normal cells, severe aneuploidy is lethal, but cancer cells are unique and can maintain some level of aneuploidy without lethality. A common therapeutic that may function by causing lethal levels of aneuploidy are the taxanes, such as paclitaxel. Taxanes bind microtubules (MTs) and modulate normal MT dynamics, which are critical for accurate chromosome segregation. However, taxanes and other anti-MT agents also affect the dynamics of MTs in neurons, causing severe neuropathy in patients. Finding new targets that alter MT dynamics and/or increase aneuploidy without affecting MT dynamics in neurons could provide new opportunities for therapeutic development. Mitotic Centromere-Associated Kinesin (MCAK), a Kinesin-13, is a major regulator of chromosome instability and aneuploidy. Functioning in normal cellular MT dynamics, MCAK binds directly to MT ends and induces their depolymerization. During mitosis, MCAK localizes to kinetochores where it uses its MT depolymerization activity to correct improper kinetochore attachments that cause lagging chromosomes leading to aneuploidy. A second kinesin motor, Kif18B (a Kinesin-8), is a plus-end directed MT motor protein that walks along MTs and destabilizes them. In cells, Kif18B localizes to the plus ends of astral microtubules and is required for chromosome alignment and proper spindle positioning. Both kinesins are also severely mis-regulated in various types of cancers, indicating that their function may be important to maintain proper ploidy and chromosome stability. Thus, inhibiting MCAK and/or Kif18B could lead to increased aneuploidy and cellular lethality in cancer cells. Interestingly, while MCAK can binds MT ends in vitro , it is proposed that Kif18B transports MCAK to the MT plus ends in cells. In addition, both kinesins bind end- binding protein (EB1), which is required for their accumulation on MT plus-ends. How the interaction between MCAK, Kif18B, and EB1 is regulated and how their activities coordinate cellular MT dynamics is unclear. To tease apart these relationships, we are characterizing their interactions to dissect their contributions in cellular MT dynamics. In addition, we are using super-resolution microscopy to define the spatial distribution of MCAK, Kif18B, and EB1 at MT ends. We have mapped the binding sites of EB1 on Kif18B as well as the importin binding sites where the nuclear transport proteins, importin /, bind Kif18B. In addition, we found that EB1 and importin / are competitive binding partners for Kif18B. We are currently developing constructs to map the interaction domains in MCAK and Kif18B and are testing the contributions of EB1 and importin / binding to Kif18B in cells. Given that disruption of MT dynamics causes chromosome instability, looking more closely at MCAK/Kif18B interactions may allow us to better pinpoint targets for anti-microtubule agents for the treatment of cancer.

Fehrenbacher1, Travis J. Jerde1 1 Department Of Pharmacology And Toxicology, Indiana University School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN Email: xiah@iu.edu Prostate cancer (PCa) cells produce a variety of neurotrophic factors that promote cancer progression and the outgrowth of nerve bers into the tumor microenvironment (TME). In addi\u0000on, nerve bers have been implicated as a conduit for metastasis, and perineural invasion has been correlated with increased risk of lethal PCa. Furthermore, recent publica \u0000ons have demonstrated that peripheral nerves can regulate cancer growth and progression. This has been demonstrated in PCa where denerva \u0000on of sympathe \u0000c and parasympathe PCa growth and migra \u0000on, prostate is densely innervated by sympathe parasympathe \u0000c, and sensory nerves, which essen \u0000al for normal prostate physiology.However, sensory innerva \u0000on of the normal and malignant prostate is poorly characterized. It is well known that pep \u0000dergic sensory nerves (PSNs) are capable of anterograde release of neuropep \u0000des essen \u0000al \u0000ng in \u0000on and remodeling during \u0000ssue repair. Therefore, we hypothesize that sensory nerves and PCa are engaged in a feed-forward rela \u0000onship, whereby the PCa TME drives sensory outgrowth and alters sensory func\u0000on to increase the anterograde release of factors that contribute to the growth and metastasis of PCa. Preliminary in vitro data demonstrate that condi\u0000oned media from an established PCa cell line, LNCaP , with IL-1 release from dorsal root ganglion (DRG) primary cultures of mouse sensory nerves beyond that elicited by vehicle, IL-1 (10ng/ml) alone, or LNCaP condi\u0000oned media alone. This suggests that PCa cells in the in flamed TME enhance the release of neuropep \u0000des from Interes \u0000ngly, visual observa LNCaP including dendri\u0000c projec\u0000ons and a mesenchymal appearance, with condi\u0000oned media from primary cultures of mouse DRG sensory nerves treated with IL-1 compared to vehicle alone. Addi\u0000onal experiments are being performed to validate these ndings and iden \u0000fy the molecular mechanisms driving these observa \u0000ons. To test whether PCa drives sensory nerve outgrowth, we will characterize sensory innerva \u0000on of the prostate with and without an orthotopic tumor. 2D immunofluorescence studies have iden \u0000ed the presence of PSN tract-like structures in the murine prostate as previously published. However, state-of-the-art imaging will be required to interrogate whether PCa alters sensory innerva \u0000on. Therefore, our group is currently op \u0000mizing whole-organ \u0000ssue clearing and immunofluorescent labeling techniques to image and render 3D visualiza \u0000ons of PSNs in the prostate. Furthermore, to assess the func\u0000onal role of PSNs in PCa in vivo, we are developing a model of the selec\u0000ve PSN abla \u0000on in a novel syngeneic orthotopic mouse model of PCa. Together, this work will, for the rst \u0000me, determine the spa \u0000al distribu\u0000on and density of PSNs in the normal and malignant prostate, and determine whether PSNs play a role in PCa progression.

This project will elucidate the role of Cd14 in liver regenera \u0000on and muscle atrophy in the mouse model and cancer pa \u0000ents. Methods: Western blot analysis was used to detect Cd14 levels in liver, muscle and serum from PH mice. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) were used to visualize Yap1 and Cd14 in PH and Yap1-overexpressing livers. IHC was used to localize CD14 expression in mouse liver metastases. Finally, human primary liver cancer and metasta \u0000c \u0000ssue microarrays (TMA) were used to detect CD14 expression by IHC. Results: Western blot and IHC showed a 3.3-fold increase in Cd14 levels in PH mouse serum compared to sham and 1.8-fold increase in livers from the PH group compared to sham, 24 hours a \u0000er PH. IF showed higher Cd14 levels in Yap1-overexpressing hepatocytes. IHC staining revealed a higher Cd14 expression in hepatocytes surrounding metastasis. Finally, TMA analysis suggests that CD14 expression is increased in human liver cancer and liver metastasis.

A major obstacle impeding the progress in the disease research field is the lack of representative normal endometrial and endometriotic cell lines and model systems. The objective of the current work is to biofabricate scaffold-free three-dimensional (3D) self-supporting perfused endometriotic tissues of endometriosis, the endometriotic microenvironment, and endometriosis- associated ovarian cancers. Fresh endometriotic lesions were dissociated to isolate primary stromal endometriotic cell cultures. Following expansion, primary human stromal cells were screened for their ability to generate solid, smooth, cohesive spheroids in ultra-low attachment U-bottom plates, which is a prerequisite for the subsequent 3D biofabrication with a Kenzan method. Upon spheroid parameters (diameter, density, smoothness, roundness) optimization, primary stromal endometriotic cells were employed for biofabrication on a Kenzan microneedle array using a Regenova Bio 3D Printer robotic system. After 24-96h incubation and removal from Kenzan needles, the multi-spheroid conglomerates retained as fused scaffold-free constructs, comprised from primary stromal endometriotic cells and self-released extracellular matrix. Importantly, co-culture of stromal cells with endometrioid ovarian cancer A2780 and SKOV3ip cells also rendered formation of more cohesive, rigid, and bioprintable heterotypic stromal/cancer spheroids in comparison with loosely connected, fragile monotypic A2780 and SKOV3ip aggregates, not competent for biofabrication. immortalized endometriotic epithelial and immortalized type I collagen-precoated microchannel-containing perfusion platens, allowing the constructs to be removed from the Kenzan needles and placed into the separate FABRICA Bioreactor. An Ismatec digital peristaltic pump controlled continuous perfusion of bioprinted tissues with the appropriate cell medium through the tissue-platen microchannels for 24-72 hours at preselected flow rate (1-5 ml/min) under routine cell culture incubation conditions. Following perfusion, all tissues were imaged, removed from the platens, and saved for subsequent applications. Histological analysis and assessment of gene expression profiles of the perfused tissues are currently underway. Altogether, herein we report in vitro biofabricated and tissues, comprised of multiple (stromal and epithelial) cell types. These novel complex and time-efficient models warrant further progress in research of endometriosis and associated cancers.

These cells increased in the cancerous breasts of CA women sugges \u0000ng their role in breast cancer adipogenic, osteogenic to characterize popula \u0000on of cells that di er in the normal breasts of AA and CA women. Results: Phenotypic characteriza \u0000on showed that PROCR+/ZEB1+ cells express adipogenic progenitors of the mouse mammary gland that transi\u0000on into epithelial cells during lobulo-alveologenesis. \u0000gen sugges \u0000ng that breast tumors in AA women can originate from two cell sources- PZP cells and luminal epithelial cells. Transformed PZP cells generated pleomorphic anaplas \u0000c sarcomas, which comprise \u0000ng their to alter the tumor microenvironment. To obtain poten \u0000al insight into signaling pathway altera \u0000ons in epithelial and PZP cells as a consequence of their cross-talk, we performed cytokine/chemokine proling of factors secreted by an immortalized luminal epithelial cell line, a PZP cell line and both co-cultured together (50% of each cell line) for ~12 hours. While luminal epithelial cell line expressed several ligands such as PDGF- AA and osteopon \u0000n, which ect trans-di eren \u0000a\u0000on of cells, PZP cells expressed factors such as EGF, HGF and SDF-1, which can signal in luminal cells. IL-6 produced condi\u0000ons in the breast microenvironment. Conclusions: Because the normal breasts of AA women naturally contain higher number of PZP cells, PZP- breast tumor cell interac\u0000on could occur early during tumor evolu\u0000on in AA compared to CA women, which creates condi\u0000ons conducive for early metasta \u0000c dissemina \u0000on in AA erences in pro-in flammatory, invasive, and pro-metasta \u0000c status of the breast could explain for disparity in breast cancer outcomes.

Methods: In vitro , we generated 3D spheroids lines, Mz-ChA-1 \u0000c), (hHSCs) treatment with H-151 (STING inhibitor, 400 nM), HA (25 mM), cromolyn (25 mM), mepyramine (25 mM) or rani\u0000dine (25 mM), we evaluated by: (i) qPCR the expression of STING, PCNA, VEGFA/C and the EMT markers S100A4 and vimen \u0000n; (ii)EIA kits HA and STING levels in culture (iii) immunofluorescence (IF) STING CK-19 (biliary marker). The same parameters were measured in tumors from nu/nu mice injected with Mz-ChA-1 cells (3 x 106) and treated with HA, cromolyn or HR antagonists. In human CCA obtained from explants, STING expression in MCs, HSCs and cholangiocytes was evaluated chymase, desmin CK-19, respec\u0000vely. Results: STING expression \u0000c CCA, whereas expression increases in intrahepa \u0000c CCA shown by qPCR and western blot. 3D spheroids originated from Mz-ChA-1 or SG231 combined with hMCs, hHSCs or a combina \u0000on and treated with HA had increased: (i) HA and STING levels; (ii) gene expression of STING, PCNA, angiogenesis and EMT markers. Inhibi\u0000on of STING had no e ect on Mz- ChA-1 CCA spheroid phenotypes, whereas blocking STING decreased SG231 CCA phenotypes. When HA/HR signaling was inhibited, both intra- and extra-hepa \u0000c 3D spheroid tumors had reduced (i) HA and STING levels; (ii) gene expression of STING, PCNA, angiogenesis and EMT markers. There was a colocaliza \u0000on of STING with MCs, cholangiocytes and HSCs in nu/nu tumors that increased a \u0000er HA treatment, but decreased when the HA/HR axis was blocked. In human CCA explants, there was increased STING immunoreac\u0000vity in MCs, HSCs and CCA cells compared to controls. Conclusion: There is a dysregula \u0000on of STING signaling in CCA that is regulated by the HA/HR axis. 3D spheroids mimic human CCA tumors and demonstrate a novel technique to study CCA phenotypes.

Basic Science Post-Doctoral/Medical FellowPOSTER #39 MECHANISMS TARGETING MUTANT P53 TO THE GENOME Stephanie Metcalf1, Peter Hollenhorst2 1 Medical Sciences, IU School Of Medicine, Bloomington, IN 2 Medical Sciences, Bloomington, IN Email: sametcal@indiana.edu Mutations in genes often result in tumor formation, especially when these mutations occur in tumor suppressors. TP53 is a tumor suppressor that is frequently mutated in cancer, with mutation in this gene occuring in nearly 50% of all cancer cases. Once mutated, p53 loses its tumor suppressive function while simultaneously gaining oncogenic function. One of the functions that mutant p53 loses is the ability to directly bind to chromatin, however, it has been reported that mutant p53 can still affect the transcriptome of cancer cells via interactions with other transcription factors. One of these interacting partners is ETS2. ETS2 belongs to the ETS transcription factor family, which has 28 family members. This family is characterized by their affinity for an ETS binding site (EBS). EBS's are present in 50% of all mutant p53 occupied promoters. Other ETS family members have also been linked to mutant p53 but these interactions have either been deemed as weak (ETS1) or have yet to be identified as direct (ERG). To determine which ETS proteins interact with mutant p53 I conducted binding studies using purified ETS proteins and purified mutants of p53. My preliminary data shows that several ETS proteins interact with mutant p53 better than ETS2. I then sought to determine which residues are important for this interaction through truncation studies in which I used purified truncations of ETS proteins and purified mutants of p53. I found that ERG, one protein that strongly interacted with mutant p53, had two interaction interfaces. This may explain why the interaction is strong. My next step is to determine which ETS proteins are responsible for the targeting of mutant p53 to the genome. To address the requirement for ETS to recruit mutant p53 to chromatin I performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing studies in the presence or absence of different ETS factors to determine differences in mutant p53 binding. For these studies I knocked down ETS2 or ERG prior to performing p53 ChIP-Seq to determine differences in p53 binding to chromatin under these conditions. My preliminary analyses of these data indicate that each of the conditions resulted in different p53 binding patterns in the ChIP-Seq. My future work will test phenotypes related to ETS/mutant p53 interactions. Ultimately, if I can identify ETS/mutant p53 interactions that are important for oncogenic function, these will be attractive targets for future drug development.

Ref-1 redox and others; all of which have been implicated in signaling in PDAC and are closely associated with cancer progression and development and therapy resistance. Using a panel of PDAC cell lines that were established from the gene \u0000cally engineered mouse model of KrasG12D muta \u0000on (KC), we screened these KC cell lines for sensi\u0000vity to Ref-1 redox signaling inhibitors, APX3330, APX2009, and APX2014 and ranked the lines based on inhibitor sensi\u0000vity. Using this data and bioinforma \u0000c tools, we iden \u0000ed key signaling pathways that may have a poten link with the eren \u0000al cells to Ref-1 lines and mTOR and Myc pathways for resistant lines. Previous evidence suggests that NFkB, one of the targets of Ref-1, plays a crucial role in PDAC pathogenesis. Therefore, we hypothesized that targe \u0000ng the Ref-1-NFkB axis through inhibi\u0000on of the redox- signaling mechanism of Ref-1 could be an e ec\u0000ve strategy for trea \u0000ng PDAC. To further decipher the role of NFkB in response to Ref-1 inhibi\u0000on in these lines, we used the KC3590 cell line that has a truncated, inac\u0000ve NFkB (RelA) gene as well as KC3590 of full length ac\u0000ve NFkB (clone 13; C13) added back. We demonstrated that de cient cells are more resistant to APX3330, APX2009, and APX2014, but their sensi\u0000vity is restored in the C13 cell line. Furthermore, we status of Ref-1.We demonstrated that upon PRDX1 knockdown, the cell line with NFkB add-back was more sensi\u0000ve to APX inhibitors than the de cient cells. Addi\u0000onally, using a gel-based protein thiol assay, measured the redox status of Ref-1, PRDX1, and NFkB in these cells as well as in cells challenged with APX compounds. Finally, we interrogated poten \u0000al involvement of STAT3 in KC cell response to APX inhibitors. Although knockdown of STAT3 did enhance the sensi\u0000vity of the NFkB de cient cells, no further enhancement was observed in the NFkB procient line. This data suggests that either NFkB or STAT3 are cri\u0000cal in the response, but the loss of both does not further enhance cell death. Overall, PDAC KrasG12D cells are more responsive to Ref-1 redox inhibi\u0000on with a func\u0000onal NFkB present. Our data further support a pivotal role of NFkB in media \u0000ng Ref-1 redox signaling in PDAC cells with the KrasG12D genotype and provide novel therapeu\u0000c strategies to combat resistance.

Reported incidence of infusion reac\u0000ons with etoposide is around 2%, while some studies have seen rates as high as 27%. Recent studies suggest that there may be a link between the use of an in-line IV lter and increased incidence of infusion reac\u0000ons in pediatric pa \u0000ents. In a previous study, we iden \u0000ed a hydrophilic polyethersulfone lter implemented at Children's Mercy Hospital (CMH) of Kansas City from 2017-2020 as a possible cause of increased rates of pediatric etoposide infusion reac\u0000ons.

Etoposide 0.4 mg/mL infusion was prepared under standard asep \u0000c condi\u0000ons, and then set up using a standard IV infusion set with an in-line lter in place. Samples were taken in triplicate from three loca \u0000ons: 1) the injec\u0000on port of the IV bag, 2) pre- lter IV tubing, and 3) post lter IV tubing. Samples 2 and 3 were collected using a needless access port. Samples were diluted and analyzed using HPLC-MS/MS. The selected reac\u0000on monitoring (SRM) Q1/Q3 (m/z) transi\u0000on for etoposide was 606.2/228.8 and the DAD wavelengths were monitored at 210, 220, 254, and 280nm and run for 30 minutes. Etoposide peak was seen at each of the observed wavelengths occurring around 10 minutes into the analysis. Addi\u0000onal peaks were also observed which were not seen in the etoposide SRM scan, but each of these addi\u0000onal peaks were consistent between each of the sampled loca\u0000ons and occurred at the same \u0000me points in each sample. Based these results, a chemical change in etoposide is unlikely to be the primary cause of increased rates of infusion reac\u0000ons related to in-line FellowPOSTER #42 CD166 AS NOVEL THERAPEUTIC TARGET TO OV ARIAN CANCER IN Email: msprasad@iupui.edu CD166 as novel therapeu\u0000c target to overcome resistance in ovarian cancer Mayuri Prasad1,2, Qipeng Fan1,2, George E Sandusky3, and Salvatore Condello1,2 1Indiana University School of Medicine, Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology 2Melvin and Bren Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center, Indianapolis, Indiana. 3Division of Hematology/Oncology, Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center. Abstract Background: Ovarian cancer (OC) is the most lethal gynecological cancer, characterized by chemoresistance and fatal tumor recurrence a \u0000er primary treatment. The development of intra-peritoneal metastases is the forma \u0000on of mul\u0000cellular spheroids by OC cells disseminated in the peritoneal fluid. Within a spheroid, OC cells undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transi\u0000on (EMT), which involves a change in cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) expression and acquisi\u0000on of cancer stem cell (CSC) characteris \u0000cs, protec\u0000ng OC cells during chemotherapy. Freshly isolated OC primary cells obtained from pa \u0000ents' ascites showed a signicant expression of CD166 (cluster of di eren \u0000a\u0000on 166). This protein is one of the CAMs involved in tumor progression and its modula \u0000on impacts cell-cell adhesion, leading to impaired ability of tumor cells to metastasize. Despite a func\u0000onal role in the tumorigenic CSC phenotype, how CD166 is regulated during OC progression remains poorly understood. Hypothesis: Our preliminary data func\u0000onally linking CD166 to the tumorigenic CSC phenotype and its overexpression in chemoresistant OC cells provide a strong ra \u0000onale to inves \u0000gate this molecule as a poten therapeu\u0000c target in OC. Methods: We compared CD166 expression in primary OC cells grown as spheroids and monolayers and in chemoresistant versus sensi\u0000ve OC cell lines by real\u0000me-PCR and Western Blot (WB). blockade by between AZN-L50 treatment was assessed and by WB of pro-apopto\u0000c proteins. Results: OC cells grown as spheroids showed a signicant increase in CD166 expression compared to the same cells grown as monolayers (n=3; P<0.0001). A comparison of normal adjacent ovarian and metasta \u0000c OC \u0000ssues on a mul\u0000\u0000ssue array (TMA) revealed CD166 expression coincided with an advanced promigratory phenotype (n= 88, P<0.001). In addi\u0000on, survival analysis associated high CD166 levels with poor overall survival in pa \u0000ents with HGSOC in the TCGA OC database by either shRNA mediated KD or AZN-L50 treatment (10 mM) led ects spheroids compared to agent alone, indica \u0000ng sustained DNA damage. Conclusions: CD166 is strongly linked to chemoresistance and is regulated by the oncogenic Wnt/b- catenin pathway. Our data suggest that inhibition of CD166 along with carboplatin treatment could be a potential combination therapy in OC. Basic Science Post-Doctoral/Medical FellowPOSTER #43 EXTRACELLULAR DEK TREATMENT MIMICS HYPOXIC BLOCKADE OF EXTRA PHYSIOLOGIC OXYGEN STRESS IN HUMAN AND MOUSE HEMATOPOIETIC CELLS James Ropa1, Scott Cooper1, Lindsay Beasley1, Broxmeyer1, Maegan Capitano1 1 Microbiology And Immunology, School Of Medicine, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN 2 Internal Medicine, Medical School, University Of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI Email: jropa@iu.edu Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a life-saving treatment for malignant and non-malignant hematologic diseases. Cord blood (CB) derived hematopoietic stem (HSC) and progenitor cells (HPC) are an important source for HCT; however, CB HSC numbers are limiting. Thus there is a strong need to enhance collection, expansion, and/or engraftment of CB derived HSC. HSC/HPC self-renewal, proliferation, survival, and function are regulated by extracellular signals from cytokines and chemokines. DEK, a nuclear regulator of chromatin availability, also functions as a cytokine that regulates HSC and HPC by enhancing pools of long-term stem cells while decreasing pools of functional HPC. To explore the effects of extracellular DEK (ecDEK) treatment on human HSC/HPC, we treated human CB CD34+ cells with human ecDEK protein and isolated HSC, multipotent progenitors (MPP), common myeloid progenitors (CMP), and granulocyte- progenitors (GMP) and performed mRNA-sequencing to profile ecDEK-dependent transcriptomes of these separate populations of HSC/HPC. These analyses revealed unique and overlapping pathways affected by ecDEK treatment in the different cell populations. Fast gene set enrichment analysis (FGSEA) revealed that after ecDEK treatment GMP upregulate gene programs associated with leukocyte migration, CMP upregulate gene programs associated with myeloid cell development, and MPP and HSC both upregulate cytokine signaling responses, though HSC also exhibited a unique downregulation of cell cycle genes. Interestingly, ecDEK treatment induced upregulation of genes associated with hypoxic responses in cells and a concordant downregulation of genes that are downregulated by hypoxic exposure in all four cell populations, suggesting that DEK may stimulate pathways related to hypoxia responses and/or response to exposure to extra physiologic oxygen. In fact, the effects on HSC and HPC induced by ecDEK is similar with previous work demonstrating that isolating HSC/HPC at 3% O2compared to ambient air conditions (~21% O2) leads to a preserved pool of functional HSC but a lower number of functional HPC, due to a phenomenon termed extracellular physiologic shock/stress (EPHOSS). To explore whether DEK regulates pathways associated with EPHOSS, we assessed the effects of in vivoecDEK treatment on HSC/HPC isolated and kept at 3% O2 or HSC/HPC exposed to 21% O2. untreated HSC/HPC isolated at 3% O2, ecDEK treated cells isolated at 3% O2 did not exhibit further increases in LT-HSC numbers or decreases in pools of functional HPC over ecDEK treatment alone. Further, ecDEK prevents ex vivoapoptosis of CB HSC/HPC populations. Thus, ecDEK may neutralize the effects of EPHOSS by counteracting gene programs induced by ambient air exposure, preventing cellular stress and resulting in HSC preservation. This has important implications for the role of ecDEK in normal and diseased hematopoiesis, as well as clinical implications wherein ecDEK may be used to mimic the HSC preserving effects of isolation at 3% O2.

However, only a fraction of cancer patients develop durable responses. The tumor microenvironment (TME) negatively impacts tumor immunity and subsequently clinical outcomes. Therefore, there is a need to identify other checkpoint targets associated with the TME. Early-onset factors secreted by stromal cells as well as tumor cells often help recruit immune cells to the TME, among which are alarmins such as IL-33. The only known receptor for IL-33 is stimulation 2 (ST2). Here we demonstrated that high ST2 expression is associated with poor survival and is correlated with low CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity in CRC patients. ST2 is particularly expressed in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). In preclinical of CRC, we demonstrated that ST2-expressing TAMs (ST2+ TAMs) were recruited into the tumor via CXCR3 expression and exacerbated the immunosuppressive TME; and that combination of ST2 depletion using ST2-KO mice with anti- programmed death 1 treatment resulted in profound growth inhibition of CRC. Finally, using the IL-33trap fusion protein, we suppressed CRC tumor growth and decreased tumor-infiltrating ST2+ TAMs. Together, our findings suggest that ST2 could serve as a potential checkpoint target for CRC immunotherapy.

This subgroup, which overexpresses chromosomal transloca bringing MAF under the control of the IGH enhancer, does not bene t from proteasome inhibitor or immunomodulatory drugs compared to other high- risk groups. In addi\u0000on, overall higher muta \u0000onal load and enrichment for APOBEC cy \u0000dine deaminase signature muta \u0000ons, which have a strong prevalence in cancer and implica \u0000ons in treatment resistance, have been associated with the t(14;16) subgroup.

Human myeloma cell lines with high c-MAF levels were used for shRNA-based knock-down of either MAF or APOBEC3B to expression to by RT- qPCR 1.8 (JJN3), 2 (RPMI8226)) and protein (fold-change: 1.7 and 1.9) levels.

Signicant decrease of APOBEC3B RNA expression (p<0.05) was observed in clone 1 (fold- change: 2.26). In clone 2 they were reduced but did not reach signicance. Reduced APOBEC3B protein levels were con rmed by western blo\u0000ng and deaminase assays. Moreover, we integrated our experimental data with RNA-seq pa \u0000ent data to iden \u0000fy clinically relevant c-MAF target genes. 84 (clone 1) and 100 (clone 2) genes iden \u0000ed as eren t(14;16) validated c-MAF target NUAK1 and ITGB7, were present in the pa \u0000ent dataset.

Conclusion: Our data demonstrates that deple \u0000on of the HDC/HA axis blunts tumor growth and progression in Mdr2-/-mice.Therefore, the HDC/HA axis plays a cri\u0000cal role in promo\u0000ng and tumor forma \u0000on, and \u0000ng this axis may result in ameliora \u0000on of cancer progression. Basic Science Post-Doctoral/Medical FellowPOSTER #47 DEVELOPMENT OF PATIENT-DERIVED XENOGRAFTS OF PRIMARY AND METASTASIS OF BREAST CANCERS WITH PROPERTIES Katie Batic1, Brijesh D Miller, Harikrishna Nakshatri 1 Surgical IU School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, pa \u0000ent-derived breast cancer xenogra \u0000s (PDXs) have been described in the literature. However, the majority of them are from triple nega \u0000ve breast cancer (TNBC). There is an urgent need to develop more PDXs from estrogen receptor (ER+) posi\u0000ve breast cancers as well as breast tumors from metasta \u0000c sites because ER+ breast cancers are more common and breast cancer metastasis may contain dis\u0000nct genome/epigenome than primary tumors and respond di erently than primary tumors to therapy. Methods: We transplanted primary tumors, cells from pleural e usions, and metastasis collected from chest wall, lymph node, or brain of breast cancer pa \u0000ents into the mammary fat pad of NSG mice. Mice were also implanted with 60-days slow release estradiol implants (72 mg). Once tumors reached 1000 mm3, a fragment of tumor was analyzed by H&E, and for levels of ER, Progesterone receptor (PR), FOXA1, GATA3, CK14, and CK19. Lungs and liver of mice at the \u0000me of sacrice were analyzed by H&E for metastasis. which is common among PDXs. Genomic DNA from blood of the donor as well as pa \u0000ent-derived xenogra \u0000s were sequenced to determine cancer-specic genomic aberra \u0000ons in select few cases. In select cases, we established cell lines from primary tumors using our recently described method. Results: We have successfully established PDXs from eight breast cancer pa \u0000ents including an ER+/PR+ primary tumor of a BRCA2 muta \u0000on carrier, ER+/PR- from an an \u0000-estrogen resistant pleural e usion, ER+/PR+ tumor from a lymph node metastasis, a brain metastasis of a TNBC, and a chemoresistant inflammatory TNBC from a BRCA1 muta \u0000on carrier. Tumors were from self-reported White, Black and Hispanic women. Several of PDXs showed lung metastasis including been successfully to obtain tumors. Muta \u0000ons in homologous recombina \u0000on pathway genes were common across three PDXs that have been sequenced. Two PDXs showed missense muta \u0000on of PIK3CD, a less studied member of the PI3 kinase family. Conclusions : We have created a series of PDXs that are less common in the literature. These PDXs are useful for evalua \u0000ng drugs that are e ec\u0000ve against metasta \u0000c breast cancers as well as inhibitors against specic kinases such as PIK3CD. These PDXs as well as primary tumor-derived cell lines are available for researchers.

Cispla \u0000n, a common chemotherapeu\u0000c, is one of the most toxic chemotherapeu\u0000cs and causes numbness, hypersensi\u0000vity to cold, and burning pain. Cispla \u0000n generates DNA adducts and oxida \u0000ve stress, the la \u0000er of which can result in oxida \u0000ve DNA damage. The base excision repair (BER) pathway is the primary way sensory neurons repair cispla \u0000n-induced oxida \u0000ve lesions, such as 8-oxyguanosine (8-oxoG); however, the role of the di erent BER enzymes has not been assessed in sensory neurons. Understanding how oxida \u0000ve DNA damage alters neuronal func\u0000on mechanisms for cispla \u0000n-induced neurotoxicity. Here, we u\u0000lized an in vitro model of cultured sensory neurons and siRNA technology to decrease the expression of the rst two enzymes of the BER pathway, 8-oxoG glycosylase (OGG1) and AP endonuclease 1 (APE1) and measured neuronal func\u0000on and morphology.

Basic Science Research TechnicianPOSTER #49 THE BREAST IN Komen Tissue Bank 2 IU School Of Medicine Email: rgerman@iu.edu Introduction: Breast cancer is a complex disease that involves numerous genetic alterations as well as changes in the microenvironment surrounding the cancer cells. In the past decades, microbial composition of human body (microbiota) raised significant attention in cancer biology. Breast tissue, once believed to be sterile, contains a specific microbial population. Moreover, the comparison of breast tissue samples shows differences in the composition and abundance of some specific bacterial taxa (known as dysbiosis) between breast cancer (BC) patients and healthy individuals. We hypothesize that dysbiosis occurs in early phase of BC development, promotes BC and is linked to BC risk factors. Methods: We employed 16S rRNA paired end sequencing (MiSeq, Illumina) to define the microbiome of normal breast tissues (N=106) donated by healthy women, and examine the link of the microbiota profile with age, BMI, menopausal status, parity of the donors. BC tissues (N=11), normal breast adjacent to tumor (NAT, N-42), metastatic BC tissue (N-6), and various negative controls (N=41) were also included into the analysis. Data analysis of the FASTQ files was performed using the online tool SHAMAN (https://shaman.pasteur.fr/) applying the RDP database for taxonomy. Results: The bacterial abundance in the samples was heterogeneous with an average alpha diversity of 38. Proteobacteria , Firmicutes , and Actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla in the tissues. Among the more abundant genera, we detected Ralstonia abundant in NAT (p=0.02) and tumor (although not significant) and Enterococcus abundant in NAT (p=0.03) as compared with normal breast, while Methylobacterium more abundant in normal breasts as compared with the other analyzed tissues. No significant correlation with age, BMI, racial background, menopausal status and parity was identified. Conclusion: Our preliminary analysis identified bacterial genera abundant in either the normal or the NAT breast, suggesting a potential role in carcinogenesis. To address the interindividual heterogeneity we are increasing the sample size. This is the first study providing a comprehensive microbiota profiling of the normal breast tissue with the goal to define links between dysbiosis and BC susceptibility. Basic Science Research TechnicianPOSTER #50 REGULATION OF ENTEROENDOCRINE PROGENITOR FORMATION BY Huntington1, Samuel Miller2, Heather O'Hagan3 1 Medical Sciences Program, Indiana University School Of Medicine, Bloomington, Indiana., Bloomington, IN 2 Genome, Cell, And Developmental Biology, Department Of Biology, Indiana University Bloomington, Bloomington, Indiana., Medical Sciences Program, Indiana University School Of Medicine, Bloomington, Indiana., Bloomington, IN 3 Medical Sciences Program, Indiana University School Of Medicine, Bloomington, Indiana., Cell, Molecular And Cancer Biology Graduate Program, Indiana University School Of Medicine, Bloomington, Indiana., Indiana University Melvin And Bren Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center, Indianapolis, Indiana., Department Of Medical And Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana., Bloomington, IN Email: thunting@iu.edu Colorectal Cancer (CRC) has a lifetime prevalence of 4.1-4.4%, and of individuals who develop CRC, 5-15% develop an especially severe form, BRAF mutant CRC. In the normal colon, stem cells at the bases of crypts of Lieberkuhn give rise to pluripotent progenitor cells that migrate upwards and differentiate into nutrient-absorbing enterocytes or secretory cells. We have shown that in mutant CRC, differentiation of hormone-secreting enteroendocrine cells (EEC's) deviates from that in the normal colon. DNA hypermethylation of the NEUROD1 promoter in BRAF mutant CRC blocks the full differentiation of EEC progenitors and contributes to enrichment of EEC progenitors in these cancers. Additionally, LSD1, a lysine demethylase that is overexpressed in CRC, is necessary for formation of EEC progenitors, and its loss decreases tumor growth and metastasis. LSD1 acts in concert with the histone deacetylase HDAC1 and a scaffolding protein, RCOR1, as part of a CoREST complex, repressing transcription of tumor suppressor genes by demethylating histone H3K4. We hypothesized that LSD1-dependent regulation of EEC progenitor formation occurs through CoREST complex activity, in conjunction with HDAC1 and RCOR1. To assess this hypothesis, we treated HT29 cells with three different classes of LSD1 inhibitors. We found that expression of early EEC marker genes was significantly decreased only by Corin, a dual HDAC1 and LSD1 inhibitor, and not by inhibitors targeting LSD1's catalytic activity or interactions with associated transcription factors. We next examined whether other isoforms of HDAC1 and RCOR1 play roles in co-regulating (with LSD1) formation of EEC progenitors in BRAF mutant CRC. Previous studies have demonstrated redundancy between HDAC1 and HDAC2 in some cell types and suggested that both may be therapeutic targets in CRC. Our data suggest that HDAC1, but not HDAC2, is necessary for EEC progenitor formation: HT29 cells, we found that knockdown (KD) of HDAC1 significantly decreased early EEC marker gene expression, while HDAC2 KD either increased or had no effect on this gene expression. Previous research in non-cancerous hematopoietic cells indicates that RCOR2 can compensate for loss of RCOR1 in helping to drive erythro- megakaryocytic differentiation, while RCOR3 counteracts this process by competitively inhibiting RCOR1. Our data suggest similar activity in BRAF mutant CRC: Following KD of RCOR1 or RCOR2, early EEC marker gene expression significantly decreased, as in LSD1 or HDAC1 KD. However, following RCOR3 KD, early EEC marker gene expression significantly increased. This finding suggests that RCOR3 may counterbalance activity of RCOR1 and RCOR2, antagonizing early EEC formation. Altogether, these findings suggest that CoREST complexes, HDAC1, and thedifferent RCOR proteins affect formation of EEC progenitors. As we previously showed that EEC progenitors promote cell survival and colony formation in HT29 cells, these findings suggest each is a potential therapeutic target in BRAF mutant CRC. Basic Science Undergraduate StudentPOSTER #51 Imade Williams, PhD1, Richard Carpenter, PhD1 1 Medical Sciences, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN Email: Bowalker@iu.edu Ovarian cancer is the \u0000h leading cause of cancer related deaths among women, with an es \u0000mated 21,410 new cases in 2021. Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) transcrip \u0000on factor and protein is the master regulator of the heat shock response and has been studied extensively, more recently, for its role in cancer metastasis and in promo\u0000ng the early stages of cancer cell malignancy. Using publicly available data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we have found that ovarian cancer pa \u0000ents have lower recurrence free survival (RFS) when HSF1 ac\u0000vity is high and coupled with MYC amplica \u0000on, sugges \u0000ng these two proteins may cooperate to support ovarian cancer growth. In the present study, we have targeted polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), which sits upstream of both HSF1 and MYC, in HSF1/MYC (dual) -amplied ovarian cancer cells. We hypothesize that MYC and HSF1 are working in conjunc\u0000on with one another to promote ovarian cancer cell growth. BI6727 (Volaser\u0000b), is an ATP-compe \u0000\u0000ve PLK1 inhibitor. We performed viability assays in ovarian MYC and amplica \u0000on (OVCAR8, lines (OVSAHO, CAOV3, PEO1) and assessed the cellular response to We obtained half maximal inhibitory concentra \u0000ons (IC50) for each cell line and found that the dual-amplied ovarian cancer cell lines were 150-fold more sensi\u0000ve to BI6727 (IC50=29.5nM) on average compared to the non-amplied ovarian cancer cell lines (IC50=4.59M). These results have important \u0000ons for dual- targe \u0000ng of MYC and HSF1 in ovarian cancer and can be applied for tes \u0000ng combinatorial treatment strategies with current standard of care chemotherapeu\u0000c carbopla \u0000n to combat chemoresistance. Furthermore, these MYC and HSF1 co-amplica \u0000on may sensi\u0000ze ovarian cancer cells to PLK1 targeted therapy.

Family caregiver concerns are overlooked during this \u0000me. Less is known about how pa \u0000ents and caregivers priori\u0000ze concerns during cancer treatments, which holds poten \u0000al for improving suppor\u0000ve oncology care (i.e., primary pallia \u0000ve care). Aim: Elicit and compare which domains of suppor\u0000ve oncology are of highest importance to pa \u0000ents and caregivers during cancer treatments. Methods: Freelisting, a cognitive anthropology method, was used to elicit concerns in order of importance.Freelist data were analyzed using Smith's salience index. Qualitative interviews were conducted with a caregiver subsample to add explanatory insights . Results: In descending order, pain, death, fear, family, and awful were salient Freelist items for pa \u0000ents (n=65), while sadness, anger, \u0000red, death, and frustra \u0000on were salient for caregivers (n=24). When integrated with domains, pa \u0000ents' concerns re flected a priori\u0000za \u0000on of the physical (pain) and emo\u0000onal (death, fear, awful) domains, with less emphasis on social (family) aspects. Caregivers' priori\u0000zed the emo\u0000onal (sadness, anger, death, frustra \u0000on) and social (\u0000me- consuming, support) domains, with less emphasis on the physical (\u0000red) aspects. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that enhancing primary palliative care delivery by oncology teams requires systems thinking to support both the patient and caregiver as the primary unit of care. Primary palliative care may be improved by prioritizing interventions that address physical concerns among patients as well as key social concerns among caregivers to support the complex caregiving role while patients undergo cancer treatments. Behavioral FacultyPOSTER #53 CHARACTERISTICS OF HOME-BASED SELF-SAMPLING FOR HUMAN ANALYSIS Erika Biederman1, Victoria Champion2, Gregory Zimet, 1 emcconne@iu.edu Introduc\u0000on Home-based self-sampling for HPV tes \u0000ng may help to increase overall cervical cancer screening rates among low-income women by overcoming barriers associated with provider-based screening. The purpose of this study was to assess preferred characteris \u0000cs for TYPE of HPV self-sampling kit (cervicovaginal or urine collec\u0000on), DELIVERY of the kit (mail, pharmacy pick-up, or clinic pick-up), RETURN of the kit (mail, pharmacy drop-o , or clinic drop-o ), and HPV RESULTS delivery (mail, phone call, or text message). Methods Data were gathered via an online survey from a sample of low-income women (household income<$50,000) provided by Dynata (n=940). They evaluated scenarios that varied along 4 dimensions: TYPE, DELIVERY , RETURN, and RESULTS. A frac\u0000onal factorial design generated 9 representa \u0000ve scenarios with varying characteris \u0000cs along each dimension. Each scenario was rated on a 0-100 scale. Ra \u0000ngs-based conjoint analysis (RBCA) created importance scores (IS) that showed how much each dimension contributed to the ra\u0000ngs of the scenarios. Part-worth u\u0000li\u0000es (PWU) generated by the rela \u0000ve preference for a characteris \u0000c within each dimension. Results The women ranged in age from 30-65 (M=51). The most important dimension (IS=32.97) was DELIVERY , with a preference for mail (PWU=1.94) or pharmacy pick-up (PWU=1.49) over clinic pick-up (PWU=-3.43). The next most important decisional factor (IS=25.09) was RETURN, with a preference for clinic drop-o (PWU=1.5) and mailed return (PWU=.5) over pharmacy drop-o (PWU=-2.31). Then test TYPE had an IS of 22.59 with a preference for urine collec\u0000on (PWU=1.84) over cervicovaginal collec\u0000on (PWU=-1.84). The least important decisional factor was RESULTS (IS=19.35), with par\u0000cipants preferring a phone call (PWU=147) over mailed delivery of results (PWU=0.21) or text messages (PWU=-1.68). Conclusions Overall, the most preferred test was a urine test delivered by mail, dropped o at a clinic, with results communicated by phone. Researchers could use these ndings to be \u0000er understand facilitators of, and barriers to, self-tes \u0000ng protocols.

We extended this literature by examining poten \u0000al clinical correlates of both perceived terminal illness and serious illness in advanced lung and prostate cancer pa \u0000ents. Advanced cancer pa \u0000ents diagnosis=3 years) were recruited from medical centers in the midwestern U.S. Pa \u0000ents completed standard measures of demographics, medical comorbidi\u0000es, func\u0000onal status, distress (anger about cancer, anxiety, depression), physical symptoms (pain, fa \u0000gue, sleep problems), and illness acceptance. Pa \u0000ents also reported whether they were \"rela \u0000vely healthy,\" \"seriously but not terminally ill,\" or \"seriously and terminally ill.\" Cancer data were collected via chart review. Logis \u0000c examined associa \u0000ons between each pa \u0000ent characteris \u0000c and perceived health status. Of the 198 pa \u0000ents with complete data, the majority (66%) iden \u0000ed as rela \u0000vely healthy, whereas others iden \u0000ed as seriously but not terminally ill (22%) or seriously and terminally ill (12%). Pa \u0000ents with lung cancer and a worse func\u0000onal status were more likely to iden \u0000fy as terminally ill than those with prostate cancer and be \u0000er func\u0000onal status (ps<.05). Other study variables were unrelated to this outcome. Both demographic (indices of lower socioeconomic status) and medical factors (lung cancer, worse func\u0000onal status, greater medical comorbidi\u0000es) were related to a higher likelihood of repor\u0000ng serious illness, irrespec\u0000ve of perceived terminality ( ps<.05). Controlling for demographic and medical factors, worse pain and anxiety were also related to a higher likelihood of repor\u0000ng serious illness (ps<.05). Other study variables were unrelated to this outcome. Findings suggest that many advanced lung and prostate cancer patients are unaware of the severity of their illness. The association between pain and perceived serious illness may be related to interpreting pain as a sign of disease progression and its functional impact. Not surprisingly, greater anxiety was also related to reports of serious illness. On average, anger about cancer was low and illness acceptance was high regardless of perceived health status. Next steps include examining predictors of perceived health status throughout the illness trajectory.

As travel is o\u0000 en a barrier to accessing care, community pharmacies, which are highly accessible, can be an important referral site for cancer pa\u0000ents to receive assistance with qui\u0000ng in their local communi\u0000es. While evidence suggests pharmacy- delivered cessa \u0000on services are clinically and cost-e ec\u0000ve, few studies have examined contextual factors influencing implementa \u0000on of these services in community pharmacies. This study aimed to characterize pharmacists' and pharmacy technicians' percep \u0000ons for tobacco cessa \u0000on in pharmacies. Methods: A total of 124 pharmacists and 127 technicians, represen \u0000ng 64 community pharmacies, par\u0000cipated in a 6- month randomized trial comparing two approaches to enhance implementa \u0000on of tobacco 6 months], were used to characterize percep \u0000ons of the AAR framework and factors influencing its adop \u0000on within the pharmacy se \u0000ng. Standard summary sta \u0000s\u0000cs, reported as means, were computed for pharmacy-specic facilitators and barriers, and these results were then compared between pharmacists and pharmacy technicians. Findings: Regarding facilitators, pharmacy personnel rated (1=not at all to 4=highly) the AAR approach as moderately compa \u0000ble with daily workflow (3.02), advantageous compared to other cessa \u0000on counseling approaches (3.13), acceptable for implemen \u0000ng into rou\u0000ne prac\u0000ce (3.11), and appropriate for use within their pharmacy (3.27). Clarity of the three steps comprising AAR was rated as moderate to high, with a mean of 3.51. Compared to technicians, pharmacists provided higher mean ra \u0000ngs for advantage (p<0.05) and acceptability (p=0.05). The highest-rated barrier was lack of available \u0000me (3.47), followed by discomfort in asking pa \u0000ents about tobacco use (2.89), lack oftraining (2.67), perceived importance of cessa \u0000on counseling as part of their job (2.56), and lack of con dence for counseling pa \u0000ents about qui\u0000ng (2.51). When considering these barriers to implemen \u0000ng AAR, technicians had lower ra \u0000ngs of perceived importance (p<0.05) and expressed less con dence for discussing qui\u0000ng with pa \u0000ents (p<0.01). Conclusion: The delivery of tobacco cessa \u0000on services in community pharmacies has the poten \u0000al to ll gaps in access to these services, which can lead to reduc\u0000ons in tobacco use and improved outcomes for cancer pa \u0000ents. Our results suggest that contextual factors might impact implementa \u0000on of AAR interven \u0000ons for tobacco cessa \u0000on in pharmacy se \u0000ngs. Future research should further explore system-level barriers and facilitatorswhile also iden \u0000fying and exploring unique experiences of pharmacy members integra \u0000ng tobacco cessa IDENTIFYING BARRIERS TO HPV V ACCINATION FOR PATIENTS WITH SICKLE CELL DISEASE AND CHILDHOOD CANCER SURVIVORS Mahvish Rahim1, Coven1 1 Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Riley Hospital For Children 2 Department Of Adolescent Medicine, Riley Hospital For Children 3 Department Of Hematology/Oncology HPV-associated malignancies. A retrospec\u0000ve chart review of childhood cancer survivors and pa \u0000ents with sickle cell disease (SCD) at Riley Hospital for Children found subop \u0000mal HPV vaccina \u0000on rates in this popula \u0000on. notable dierence between the increased risk for secondary malignancies, demonstra \u0000ng the need to be \u0000er understand barriers to vaccina \u0000on against a cancer-causing organism for our adolescent and young adult pa \u0000ents. In the general pediatric popula \u0000on, HPV vaccine hesitancy has been shown to be mul\u0000-factorial. Less is known about vaccine hesitancy in hematology and oncology popula \u0000ons. Objec\u0000ve: Our objec\u0000ve was beliefs regarding HPV vaccina \u0000on, and system-level barriers. Design/Method: We used qualita \u0000ve methods because less is known about vaccine hesitancy in this popula \u0000on. We recruited HPV vaccine decision-makers in Sickle Cell Disease and Oncology Survivor clinics, including caregivers of pa \u0000ents aged 9-18 years, and both caregivers of and pa \u0000ents themselves aged 18- 21years. Data were collected via audio recorded qualita \u0000ve interviews conducted either in person or virtually. Ques \u0000ons assessed trust in the medical system, HPV vaccine baseline knowledge, and misconcep \u0000ons about the vaccine. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed with thema \u0000c content analysis, with coding based on over-arching themes such as vaccine misconcep \u0000ons, side e ects, disease interac\u0000ons with the HPV vaccine. These themes were organized into a model of caregivers' and pa \u0000ents' experiences, a\u0000tudes, and barriers with regards to HPV vaccina most common themes iden \u0000ed were misconcep \u0000ons and lack of baseline knowledge. Many did not know what the HPV vaccine was, as they had not previously been counseled on it or they could not remember the indica \u0000on for the HPV vaccine. Misconcep \u0000ons included the percep that was a gateway to sexual ac\u0000vity, that HPV vaccine was new, or exclusively for females. There was concern regarding poten \u0000al for increased risk of side e ects with the HPV vaccine in the se \u0000ng of a chronic disease. We found that pa \u0000ents and caregivers stated that they would be reassured about the vaccine by a strong HPV vaccina \u0000on recommenda \u0000on from a provider, and many preferred counseling about the safety of the vaccine in the context of their child's or their own illness, indica \u0000ng a trust between the provider and the pa \u0000ent. Conclusion: The ndings from this study demonstrate the need for improved HPV vaccina \u0000on counseling and promo\u0000on in sickle cell disease and oncology survivor pa \u0000ent popula \u0000ons. Improved counseling HPV vaccina \u0000on can poten \u0000ally have a strong impact on a family's understanding of the vaccine in the context of their adolescent's chronic illness. Behavioral Post-Doctoral/Medical FellowPOSTER #57 PALPITATIONS AND CO-OCCURRING MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS IN WOMEN PRIOR TO BREAST CANCER SURGERY Ying Sheng1, Janet Carpenter1, Steven Paul2, Christine Miaskowski2 1 IU School Of Nursing, Indianapolis, IN 2 University Of California, San Francisco, CA Email: shengyin@iu.edu Background: Palpita \u0000ons are described as racing, pounding, or skipped heart beats that are associated with greater sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety, and stress. Palpita \u0000ons in women with breast cancer may be related to the cancer and/or its treatment. Unlike other menopausal symptoms (e.g., hot flashes, night sweats) associated with breast cancer and its treatments, palpita \u0000ons are understudied. Therefore, a need exists to evaluate the occurrence of palpita \u0000ons, associated risk factors, and the co-occurrence of other menopausal symptoms in these pa \u0000ents. Purpose: Evaluate for di erences in demographics and clinical characteris \u0000cs, as well as the occurrence of as well as the severity and distress associated with 45 menopausal symptoms between women with breast cancer who did and did not report palpita \u0000ons prior to surgery. Methods: This analysis u\u0000lized data from a longitudinal study of neuropathic pain and lymphedema in women who underwent breast cancer surgery. Prior to surgery, 393 women completed ques \u0000onnaires on demographic and clinical characteris \u0000cs, func\u0000onal status using the Karnofsky Performance Status Ques \u0000onnaire, palpita \u0000ons (yes/no), menopausal symptoms using the Menopausal Symptoms Scale. Pa \u0000ents were categorized into two groups (i.e., those with and those without palpita \u0000ons). Data were analyzed using descrip \u0000ve sta \u0000s\u0000cs, t- tests, Fisher Exact tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and Chi-square tests. Results: Of \u0000ents, (n=338) did not have palpita \u0000ons prior to breast cancer surgery. Pa \u0000ents with palpita \u0000ons had lower annual household income (5.3\u00b13.2 versus 4.1\u00b12.7, p=.004), were likely to report back pain (43.3% versus 25.4%, p=.008), and higher total number (excluding palpita \u0000ons) (21.5\u00b17.8 versus Pa \u0000ents p=.001). addi\u0000on, they higher distress scores for anxiety (5.7\u00b12.7 versus 4.2\u00b12.7, p=.001), hot inves \u0000ga\u0000on, these ndings suggest that 15% of women prior to surgery experience this symptom. Palpita \u0000ons appear to co-occur with a number of menopausal symptoms. Future research is warranted on the impact of palpita \u0000ons on other aspects of women's lives including quality of life and coping. In addi\u0000on, the mechanisms that underlie palpita \u0000ons warrant inves \u0000ga\u0000on. Post-Doctoral/Medical FellowPOSTER #58 COMMUNICATION COST OF CANCER CARE: ATTITUDES AND PRACTICES OF ONCOLOGISTS Ahmed Bilal Khalid1, Samuel Urrutia2, Nasser Hanna1 1 Indiana University School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 2 The University Of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX Email: ahkhalid@iu.edu Introduc\u0000on: With the cost of cancer care rising, it is becoming ever so important for physicians to be mindful of nancial toxicity to their pa \u0000ents. Pa \u0000ent-provider cost discussions are associated with lower out of pocket costs (Hong el al, Value in Health 2020), yet few pa \u0000ents report having this discussion with their providers. Li\u0000le is known about the oncologist's perspec\u0000ve on cost discussion including their preparedness, current prac\u0000ce, and barriers in not being able to have this discussion. Methods: An online survey was administered to Hematology/Oncology a \u0000ending physicians and fellows at Indiana University. The objec\u0000ves were to assess a \u0000tudes on communica \u0000on about cost of cancer care and awareness around nancial toxicity of cancer therapy. The ques \u0000ons included physician percep\u0000on on pa\u0000ent's a \u0000tudes towards cost discussion, current state of cost discussion in their clinic and their preparedness on having this discussion in the future. Results: 27/48 (56%) fellows and faculty members completed the survey. All respondents believed cost communica \u0000on is associated with improved pa \u0000ent outcomes and 22/27 (81%) believed cost communica \u0000on is desired by most pa \u0000ents. 22/27 (81%) indicated cost of care were discussed in less than half of pa \u0000ent encounters. 22/27 (81%) of respondents also believed clear communica \u0000on about cost should be a part of a pa\u0000ent's clinic visit. When asked to rate their preparedness level on a scale of 0-100 in discussing cost of cancer care in their clinics, the median preparedness level was 20. Median awareness level about pa \u0000ent's insurance plan was also 20 and median awareness level about pa \u0000ent out of pocket cost was 21. 26/27 (96%) believed knowing cost of therapy and out of pocket cost would change the way they prac\u0000ce oncology. Not knowing the cost of cancer care themselves was rated as the greatest barrier behind not being able to discuss cost by 20/27 physicians (74%). Conclusion: Despite physicians believing cost of cancer care should be discussed in the clinic, most fail to do so. Physician educa \u0000on on cost of cancer care and training on how to have this discussion in the clinic is needed.

We process of going from risk factors to risk es \u0000ma \u0000on and whether and how to screen. METHODS: We used data from 450 cases of EOCRC among 35-49 year-old male Veteran controls matched for site and year of case diagnosis. The top 15 risk factors based univariable p-values were selected for a multivariable logistic regression model. Mode with 10-fold cross-validation determined final model (Table 1). To make the model decision-making, we calculated the relative risk (RR) estimate for 5 risk scenarios: scenario (no factors present), 3 intermediate risk (some risk factors present), and 1 high-ri factors present), and applied these RR estimates to each of 3 SEER age groups (35-39, 40 49 years). For each scenario, we multiplied the baseline SEER CRC incidence rate x (1- A Risk) x RR estimate to calculate a revised CRC incidence rate (\"colon age\"). When confidence limit of the revised estimate was current SEER CRC incidence for 50-54 y recommendation for screening was made; when it was that for 70-74 year olds, scre colonoscopy was recommended. RESULTS: Among 2250 subjects (mean [SD] age 44.3 [4.0]; 65.6% Caucasian), a 12 model demonstrated good fit (mean squared error = 0.14) and discrimination (c-statisti Table 2 shows 5 risk scenarios for each age group , revised incidence rates, comparison to 50-54 age group, and whether / how to screen.

Methods This is a planned secondary analysis of pa \u0000ents with suspected SARS-CoV-2 with (n= 2,871) and without (n= 2,871) a diagnosis of cancer. This data is from a mul\u0000center registry of 116 emergency departments (ED) in 27 US states. In a nested case-control design we compared mortality, hospitaliza \u0000on, ven\u0000latory support, presence of new blood clots, circulatory support, and mortality for pa \u0000ents with and without cancer, based on COVID-19-posi\u0000vity. Results Pa\u0000ents with a posi\u0000ve COVID-19 test, irrespec\u0000ve of cancer-status were more likely to be male (53.7%, 52.9%, cancer posi\u0000ve and cancer free, respec\u0000vely). Black or African American race were seen at higher rates based on COVID-19-posi\u0000vty, with 33.8% of the cancer posi\u0000ve and 36.8% of cancer-free, and 24.7% respec\u0000vely. Similarly, Hispanic/La \u0000no ethnicity were more commonly seen in the COVID-19-posi\u0000ve cohort. Among cancer subjects, most pa \u0000ents were found to have a localized solid tumor (72.0% vs 80.9%, COVID-19 nega \u0000ve vs -posi\u0000ve, respec\u0000vely). The most common types of cancers observed based on COVID-19-posi\u0000vity were breast (25.9%), prostate (15.8%), and colorectal cancer (12.3%). Pa \u0000ents with cancer and posi\u0000ve COVID-19 test had the highest rate of mortality among all cohorts (25.5%), more likely to be hospitalized, more likely to be admi\u0000 ed to the ICU, more likely to require ven \u0000latory support, and more likely to require circulatory support. Lastly, 35.8% of the COVID-19 posi\u0000ve cancer cohort and 31.8% of COVID-19 posi\u0000ve cancer free cohort were black race, compared to 14.3% of COVID-19 nega \u0000ve cancer cohort and 19.2% COVID-19 nega \u0000ve cancer free cohort. Conclusion Among ED pa \u0000ents with cancer, clinical outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infec\u0000on were worse compared to pa \u0000ents without cancer, with racial dispari\u0000es in both the presence of COVID-19 posi\u0000vity and mortality. Population Science/Epidemiology FacultyPOSTER #61 DISPARITIES IN OUTCOMES AMONG PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER IN PROXIMITY TO AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISIT; A STATEWIDE EPIDEMIOLOGIC ASSESSMENT OF NEW CANCER DIAGNOSES Nicholas Pettit1 1 Emergency Medicine, Zionsville, IN Email: nrpettit@iu.edu Asuspected diagnosis of cancer in the emergency department (ED) may be associated with poor outcomes however data are limited.This is case-control analysis of the Indiana State Department of Health Cancer Registry, and the Indiana Network for Pa \u0000ent Care. First \u0000me cancer diagnoses appearing registries from 2013-2017 were included. Cases were pa \u0000ents who had an ED visit in the 6 months before their cancer diagnosis; controls had no recent ED visits. 134,761 rst-\u0000me cancer pa \u0000ents were iden \u0000ed, including 15,432 (11.5%) cases. The mean age was same at 65, more of the cases were Black than the controls (12.4% vs 7.4%, P<.0001) and more were low income (36.4%. vs 29.3%). The most common ED-associated cancer diagnosis was lung cancer at 18.4% of the cases. Cases observed an over three-fold higher mortality, with cumula \u0000ve death rate of 32.9% for cases vs 9.0% for controls (P<.0001). Adjusted regression analysis predic\u0000ng mortality produced an odds ra \u0000o of 4.12 (95% CI 3.72-4.56) for ED associated cancers.These data suggest that addi\u0000onal work is needed to reduce dispari\u0000es among ED-associated cancer diagnoses.

Overall incidence rates are higher in Indiana than the na \u0000onal average. With Indiana University (IU) Health being the largest healthcare system and cancer treatment provider in Indiana, it is vital to understand vast cancer popula \u0000on cared for by IU Health. Purpose: The purpose of this work is to describe the process of u\u0000lizing the IU Health Cancer Registry to descrip \u0000vely analyze popula \u0000on of cancer pa \u0000ents diagnosed within IU Health from 2007-2017. This work will describe the process of narrowing down raw electronic health record data into cleaned cancer sites that can be easily reported and u\u0000lized for data analysis. Methods: Data were obtained from the IU Health Cancer Registry via the Regenstrief Ins \u0000tute. All individuals diagnosed with cancer in the IU Health system during 2007-2017 that were reported to the registry and had available data were included. Variables pulled from the cancer registry included various demographic and cancer variables, including Interna \u0000onal Classica \u0000on of Diseases (ICD) site codes, histology codes. All unique ICD site and histology codes across the sample were gathered to be narrowed down to create a nal cancer site variable. ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes were both included, depending on the year of diagnosis. A team consis \u0000ng of a nurse/cancer health services researcher, physician/cancer health services researcher, and economics and health services pre-doctoral fellow u\u0000lized clinical exper\u0000se, the NCI Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, and American Cancer Society Facts and Figures to collapse the ICD codes into cancer sites. Once site codes were narrowed, a new variable was created in STATA 16.1, with a numeric value assigned to each cancer site. Results: The sample consisted of 65,879 cancer pa \u0000ents across Indiana. The data set included 305 unique ICD primary site diagnosis codes and 576 unique ICD histology codes (each par\u0000cipant had one site and one histology code). This work resulted in a nal cancer site variable consis \u0000ng of 25 categories, two of which were \"unknown,\" if the primary site could not be determined, and \"other,\" if the site could not categorized into one of the 23 sites. Other and unknown made up <5% of the sample. The three most prevalent cancer sites were breast, lung, and prostate - all with more than 11% of the sample, which is fairly consistent with na\u0000onal incidence rates. Conclusions: This process allows us to report on the incidence rates of cancer sites across IU Health from 2007-2017 and is a primary step in the data management phase for a larger secondary analysis to examine trends of healthcare u\u0000liza \u0000on of cancer pa \u0000ents across Indiana.

However, as technology advances and plays an increasingly important role in managing health informa \u0000on, data quality concerns are becoming more prevalent in health informa \u0000cs and informa \u0000on management. Raw EHR data is rarely, if ever, in a manageable state for data analysis, with concerns of inaccuracy, duplica \u0000ons, missing data, and other issues. With greater access to EHR data and the poten \u0000al impact, there is a need to develop methodologic approach to cleaning raw EHR in order to be u\u0000lized for data analysis. Purpose: To describe a methodologic approach for cleaning raw EHR data for hospital admissions and emergency room (ER) visits for cancer (cases) and non-cancer (controls) pa \u0000ents across Indiana. Methods: Data were obtained from the Indiana Network for Pa \u0000ent Care (INPC) database via the Regenstrief Ins\u0000tute. A modied data quality framework developed by Kahn et al. (2012) was u\u0000lized to guide this approach. Interac\u0000ons were rst split into care se \u0000ng - hospitaliza \u0000ons and ER visits. The current, previous and following admission and discharge dates are denoted as An and Dn, An-1 and Dn-1 and An+1 Dn+1 respec\u0000vely, where n is the number of interac\u0000ons corresponding to each id. Admission dates were dropped if greater than the corresponding discharge dates as it wasn't reasonable, followed by iden \u0000fying duplicate admission and discharge dates. Next, few special cases of duplicates were dealt with within each id and their care se \u0000ngs; rstly, two consecu\u0000ve admission dates were counted as one if the corresponding discharge dates were missing, otherwise counted as two separate admission dates if they had corresponding discharge dates. Secondly, An that fell within the range of An-1 and Dn-1 with either missing corresponding Dn or with Dn being Dn-1 were eliminated. Thirdly, An being same with Dn and An+1, with Dn < Dn+1 were eliminated. Fourthly, interac\u0000ons where Dn were same as An and Dn-1, with An > An-1 were eliminated. Lastly, overlapping interac\u0000ons where An fell within the range of An-1 and Dn-1 and Dn > Dn-1, the minimum of the two admission dates, An and An-1 and the maximum of the two discharge dates, Dn and Dn-1 were included. The analyses were performed using Stata 16.1. Stata codes and date examples will be provided during presenta \u0000on. Conclusion: By developing and following a step-by-step framework for cleaning EHR data, we can hope to ensure the highest quality data to u\u0000lize for analysis in order to enhance pa \u0000ent care and outcomes and clinical research moving forward. Population Science/Epidemiology Graduate StudentPOSTER #64 CHARACTERIZATION OF CUTANEOUS METASTASIS OF COLON CANCER REMAINS CHALLENGING Joseph Nenow1 1 Transitional Year, Indianapolis, IN Email: josephnenow@gmail.com Intro: Colon cancer is the 3rd highest prevalence of all cancer subtypes in the US. Despite their poten \u0000al for aid in diagnosis, the cutaneous metastasis of colon cancer has been poorly described. Methods: A Pubmed search was conducted using search terms \"cutaneous metastasis colon\" with \"cancer\" or \"adenocarcinoma\", which yield 145 and 95 results respec\u0000vely. Once reviewed for redundancy and relevance, 52 ar\u0000cles remained. Inclusion criteria: skin biopsy to con rm metastasis and cutaneous ndings, English language. Gender, age, morphology, and distribu\u0000on of lesions were included in the study. The study included 60 pa \u0000ents total with average age of 65 and ranging from 35-92.Males accounted for Rela \u0000ve \u0000ve to the total number of individual skin lesions, lesions tended to be, in descending order, nodular 36%, masses 34%, rm consistency lesions were dispropor\u0000onately reported to occur (27%), anterior torso (31%), and groin (11%) rela \u0000ve to body surface area. Lesions were propor\u0000onately unlikely in to be found on the extremi\u0000es rela \u0000ve to body 2%. Discussion: Extrapola \u0000on was limited be the dearth of standardized data available for analysis. Herein, we propose criteria for repor\u0000ng of physical exam of cutaneous metastasis of morphology may assist in diagnosis of cancer type. Analysis of the distribu\u0000on of cutaneous lesions is useful to direct physical exam ndings in pa \u0000ents with histories of cancer. Population Science/Epidemiology Graduate StudentPOSTER #65 A NEGATIVE BINOMIAL REGRESSION MODEL FOR ESTIMATION RISK OF NON- MELANOMATOUS AND MELANOMATOUS SKIN CANCER. Joseph Nenow1, Kenai Transitional Year, Indianapolis, IN Email: josephnenow@gmail.com Intro Seasonality is a well-documented phenomenon in the diagnosis of many pathologies (e.g. melanomatous and non-melanomatous skin cancers, benign skin lesions, and internal malignancies). Explanations for this phenomenon revolve around discussions of access to care, exposure to UV radiation, or the role of vitamin D in cancer pathogenesis. Recent research on seasonal diagnosis in skin cancer has utilized a quantitative approach to predict the risk of cancer diagnosis based on summed recent UV exposure. We aim to expand this technique to analyze the risk of a diagnosis of basal cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, and melanomas for patients in Greenville, NC from 1994-2017. Methods Historical data regarding loco-regional UV intensity was gathered from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration website for Raleigh, NC from 1994-2017. Dates for biopsy confirmation of skin cancer were collected from ECU physicians over a similar period. Five periods of time were chosen over which to sum UV Data (month of diagnosis, the first, second-, and third- month preceding diagnosis, as well as the sum of UV exposure over months one and two. Diagnosis data were grouped by type of cancer diagnosis (i.e. basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or melanoma). RStudio was used to generate negative binomial models for predicted risk of diagnosis. Results For both melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma, no failed achieved statistical significance. The strongest relationship between melanoma and cumulative UV dose existed during the concurrent month of diagnosis (p = 0.056). For squamous cell carcinoma, the strongest relationship existed between the date of squamous cell diagnosis and cumulative UV exposure three months preceding diagnosis (p = 0.0715). For basal cell carcinoma, cumulative UV exposure in the two months preceding diagnosis was associated with statistical significance (p = 0.0008). Conclusion Previous research has identified cumulative UV exposure in the two months preceding diagnosis as an effective method for addressing the role of UV exposure in the seasonal diagnosis of melanoma. Basal cell carcinoma has been traditionally expected to develop over the course of several months.Here the risk of diagnosis with basal cell carcinoma has been most strongly associated with the sum of UV data in the two months preceding diagnosis. UV exposure has been associated with the development of skin cancer in sun-exposed areas. However, limitations in access to patient data include gender, age, and location of skin cancer challenge further discussion at this time. Further research should address the utility of classifier models for predicting risk in basal cell carcinoma.

Fairbanks School of Public Health, Indiana University, 1050 fatty acid intake and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) in men is limited. In this study, we aimed at cross-sectionally exploring the association of omega-3 fatty acid intake with LTL in US men. We included 2,494 participants with LTL measurement from 4 nested case- control studies of Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS). Individuals with previous histories of cancers, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases at or prior to blood collection were excluded. Blood collection was performed between 1993 and 1995 and relevant information including omega-3 intakes was collected in 1994 by questionnaire. The LTL was long-transformed and Z scores of the LTL were calculated for statistical analyses by standardizing the LTL in comparison with the mean within each selected nested case-control study. We found that consumption of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was positively associated with LTL. In the multivariable-adjusted model, compared to the individuals who had least intake of DHA (i.e., first quartile group), the percentage differences [95% confidence intervals and 8.9% (-2.8%~22.1%) for those individuals who were in the second, third, and fourth quartile group of the consumption, respectively (P for trend = 0.04). Additionally, we found that men who have higher consumption (>=median) of canned tuna had relatively longer LTL, compared to those with less consumption (<median); in the multivariable-adjusted model, the percentage difference (95% CI) of LTL was 10.6% (1.4%~20.6%) (P value = 0.02). Our results suggest that higher intakes of DHA and canned tuna are associated with longer LTL.

Fairbanks School Of Public Health, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN 2 Department Of Pediatrics, Indiana University School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 3 Center For Biomedical Informatics, Regenstrief Institute 4 Riley Hospital For Children Email: omilgrom@iu.edu Background: Cancer is the second leading cause of death in Indiana. To address the increasing cancer burden, a tele-mentoring program using the Extension for Community Health Care Outcomes (ECHO) model focusing on cancer prevention, screening, and survivorship care (Cancer ECHO program), was deployed in September 2019 to provide continuing medical education and guide best- practice care to primary care providers (PCP). The purpose of this study was to conduct a formative evaluation of the program and to identify and explore complex factors that influence the adoption and implementation of the program. Methods: We utilized quantitative program administrative data, qualitative data from semi-structured interviews (N=22) with the participants (hub and spoke members) of Cancer ECHO and the participants of other ECHO programs at Indiana University (IU). The qualitative data were analyzed thematically, using a conceptual model of Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Results: During the pilot year, 147 unique individuals have participated the program at least once with an average of 14.5 per session. The CFIR constructs of external policy and incentives and available time resources were the most prominent among the six barriers to participation. Relative advantage, design quality, tension for change, learning climiate, access to knowledge and information, reflecting and evaluation arose as facilitators, while knowledge and beliefs received mixed results. Conclusions: This study identified a relative lower PCP participation in the Cancer ECHO program and multiple interacting CFIR constructs factors influencing the program adoption and implementation. The CFIR approach guided us to understand the barriers and facilitators that have broader applicability to other ECHO replications. Statement of Significance: The pandemic-catalyzed rapid expansion of telehealth usage imposed the importance of virtual collaboration in clinical care and education. Tele-mentoring using the ECHO model is well-suited to democratize complex cancer control knowledge among health professionals in medically isolated communities. However, the success of new ECHO adoption relies on understanding key contextual factors and little is known in the context of cancer prevention and survivorship.The significance of this work is that by examining a pilot program using an implementation science framework, we informed the future intervention about the potential acceptance issue and the reasons through the audience's lens. The results allowed us to understand the complexity of applying the ECHO model on cancer prevention and survivorship care and determined actionable facets for guiding ongoing program adaptations.

However, few studies have examined large, mul\u0000-center cancer popula \u0000ons. Our aim was to examine the associa \u0000on of COVID-19 diagnosis and all-cause mortality in a large cancer popula \u0000on using a statewide electronic health record (EHR) database. Methods: A retrospec\u0000ve cohort study of individuals 18 years and older with newly diagnosed cancer in the state of Indiana between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020. Data were u\u0000lized from the Indiana Network for Pa \u0000ent Care (INPC), which contains electronic health records for individuals across 38 dis \u0000nct health systems including the IU Simon Cancer Center. New cancer diagnosis was assessed using Interna \u0000onal Classica \u0000on of Disease (ICD) codes documented in pa \u0000ents' EHR. The exposure variable was COVID-19 diagnosis based on a con rmatory RT-PCR assay test from a throat or nose swab posi\u0000ve for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The primary outcome of the study was all-cause mortality a\u0000er diagnosis of COVID-19. We used Kaplan-Meier analysis to es \u0000mate the unadjusted survival over \u0000me. We examined the associa \u0000on of COVID-19 diagnosis and all-cause mortality using unadjusted and adjusted Cox-propor\u0000onal hazard regression, controlling for age, race, sex, number of chronic diseases, and cancer type to es \u0000mate the hazard ra \u0000os (HRs) and 95% con dence intervals (CIs). Results: A total of 24,306 individuals received a new diagnosis of cancer during the study period. The mean (SD) age was 65 (\u00b113.9) years and those diagnosed with COVID-19 were slightly younger [64.3 (\u00b114.7)]. The majority of the popula \u0000on was White (82.2%) with males (51.4%) and females (48.6%). The highest incidence of malignancies was for breast (13.9%) and prostate (13.3%) cancer. In the adjusted model, there was a 37% increased (HR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.15-1.63) risk of death among those with a COVID-19 diagnosis compared to those without. The risk of death increased 36% (HR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.30-1.42) per 10-year increase a 20% (HR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.08-1.34) greater risk of death compared to females. Individuals with two or more chronic diseases had 2-fold (HR: 2.10, 95% CI: 1.84-1.34) risk of death compared to those without a chronic disease. Among cancers, the highest mortality was observed in those with other diges \u0000ve cancers (HR: 1.68, 1.54, CI: compared to the other cancer group. Conclusion: COVID-19 infec\u0000on increases risk of death among individuals newly diagnosed with cancer. Mortality risk further increases based on demographic factors, certain cancer subtypes, and comorbidi\u0000es. Our results highlight the need for cancer popula \u0000ons to take extra precau\u0000ons against COVID-19 infec\u0000on, and social distancing.

Previous ScRNA-seq on breast u\u0000lized reduc\u0000on mammoplasty samples, which are o\u0000 en histologically abnormal. We report a rapid \u0000ssue collec\u0000on/processing protocol to perform ScRNA-seq of breast biopsies of healthy women and iden \u0000fy 23 breast epithelial cell clusters. Puta \u0000ve cell-of-origin signatures derived from these clusters are applied to analyze transcriptomes of ~3000 breast cancers. Gene signatures derived from mature luminal cell clusters are enriched in ~68% of breast cancers, whereas a signature from a luminal progenitor cluster is enriched in ~20% of breast cancers. Overexpression of luminal progenitor cluster-derived signatures in HER2+ but not in other subtypes is associated with unfavorable outcome. We iden \u0000fy TBX3 and PDK4 as genes co-expressed with estrogen receptor (ER) in the normal breasts, and their expression analyses in >550 breast cancers enable prognos \u0000cally relevant subclassica \u0000on of ER+ breast cancers.

Hormones and sex chromosomal differences are suggested to mediate these differences, but the functional skeletal muscle markers to document these differences are unknown. We show that the myogenic microRNA miR-486 is a marker of sex- specific differences in cancer-induced skeletal muscle defects. Cancer-induced loss of circulating miR-486 was more severe in men with bladder, lung, and pancreatic cancers compared to women with the same cancer types. In a syngeneic model of pancreatic cancer, circulating and skeletal muscle loss of miR-486 was more severe in male mice compared to female mice. Estradiol (E2) and the clinically used selective estrogen receptor modulator toremifene increased miR-486 in undifferentiated cell line C2C12 and E2-inducible expression correlated with direct binding of estrogen receptor alpha (ER) to the regulatory region of the miR-486 gene. E2 and toremifene reduced the actions of cytokines such as myostatin, transforming growth factor , and tumor necrosis factor , which mediate cancer-induced skeletal muscle wasting. E2- and toremifene-treated C2C12 myoblast/myotube cells contained elevated levels of active protein kinase B (AKT) with a corresponding decrease in the levels of its negative regulator PTEN, which is a target of miR-486. We propose an ER:E2-miR-486-AKT signaling axis, which reduces the deleterious effects of cancer-induced cytokines/chemokines on skeletal muscle mass and/or function.

Previous studies have revealed mutations in the spliceosomecomplex,such asSF3B1,can cause increased AS frequencies in multiple myeloma (MM)patients, and patients with increased levels of AS are associated with a poor prognosis.Other frequently mutated genes involved in RNA processing includeDIS3andF AM46C,thus, investigating generate AScomparisons.Theywerepreviously annotated for cytogenetic, mutation (version IA16).RNA-seq datawerealigned to HG38 using STAR and Salmon.SUPPA2 was used for calling AS differences. For each identified AS event, the splicing level was defined by Percentage of Spliced-In (PSI) while the mean difference of splicing levels between two groups was measured by PSI (dPSI)andby the P-value from independent T-tests against PSIs in the two groups. Filtering thresholds were determined to findhigh-quality differentially spliced events andwerefiltered for those also present in normal PCs(GSE110486). Genesetenrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to identifydysregulated pathways caused by differential splicing and differential expression. Survival analysis wasperformed onclinical annotations of 598 NDMM patients whilethe Logranktest toevaluatethe risk of AS and other genomic factors.

Despite treatment with chemotherapies, approximately 35% of OS patients develop metastases and relapse. Alteration of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) is one of the top actionable signatures, based on genomic data from pediatric and AYA patients enrolled in the Precision Genomics program at Riley Hospital for Children, Indiana University Health. Interaction of retinoblastoma protein (RB)-E2F transcription factors is regulated by the cyclin DCDK4/6 complex. Upon RB phosphorylation mediated by cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex, the RB-E2F complex cell cycle progression ensues. FDA-approved CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) are typically classified as cytostatic resulting in cell cycle arrest in contrast to cell death. In addition, chronic administration of CDK4/6i can lead to acquired resistance in RB1-proficient (RB+) tumors through activation of compensatory pathways such as PI3K and MAPK. Aberrant PI3K activation has also been demonstrated in OS patients. We hypothesized that dual inhibition of CDK4/6 and PI3K pathways will be efficient and well-tolerated in RB+ OS models with hyperactivation of the cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex.

A pharmacodynamic (PD) study of Palbociclib (CDK4/6i) on the TT2-77 PDX tumors from mice treated with vehicle vs. Palbociclib for five days was conducted, and both global/phospho-proteomics and kinome profiling analyses were performed to evaluate down-stream target modulation and provide insight into potential CDK4/6i-induced compensatory pathways. Down-regulation of RB1 and MKI67 phosphopeptides and total protein levels of CDK1, as well as DNA replication proteins, were observed, confirming that Palbociclib targets the cell cycle-related proteins. Kinomeprofiling analysis tyrosine kinase upregulation following CDK4/6i therapy. AXL activity can promote cell proliferation through downstream effector molecules, including PI3K pathway proteins. Thus, this may be an alternative approach to target CDK4/6i resistance in OS. Furthermore, TT2-77 PDX mice were treated with Palbociclib (50 mg/kg) and V oxtalisib (50 mg/kg) once a day for four weeks. Tumor growth was significantly decreased in single-agent groups compared to vehicle (p<0.01) and was well tolerated. Despite the slower tumor growth kinetics, tumor growth still progressed under single-agent therapy. These data highlight the need for combination therapy, and experiments are in progress to evaluate anti- tumor response and safety of combination Palbociclib and Voxtalisib in a panel of OS PDX. Translational/Clinical Research Graduate StudentPOSTER #73 CANCER ASSOCIATED FIBROBLASTS PROVIDE A CANCER STEM CELL NICHE THAT LEADS TO DISEASE RELAPSE IN OV University School Of Medicine, Bloomington, IN 2 IUSCCC 3 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Email: yimfang@iu.edu Epithelial ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecologic malignancy with a 5-year survival rate of only 48%. While most ovarian cancer pa \u0000ents respond to chemotherapy ini\u0000ally, frequent relapse and development of chemoresistance result in poor pa \u0000ent outcomes. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) consist of a small subpopula \u0000on in the tumor that are typically resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy and are a poten \u0000al cause of relapse and chemoresistance. Using pa \u0000ent specimens and in vitro models, we determined that CSCs are enriched in a niche adjacent to cancer associated broblasts(CAFs) a \u0000er chemotherapy. Cancer associated broblasts (CAFs) are a major cons \u0000tuent of the ovarian cancer tumor microenvironment and are highly enriched in the residual tumors following chemotherapy. Therefore, we studied the mechanism by which CAFs promote ovarian cancer chemoresistance and disease relapse by providing an op \u0000mal microenvironment for CSCs. CAFs isolated from ovarian cancer pa \u0000ent tumors were used in heterotypic 2D or 3D coculture systems with high-grade serous ovarian cancer cell lines or with pa \u0000ent-derived ovarian cancer cells to study their e ect on CSCs and chemoresistance. Matched pre-and post-chemotherapy pa \u0000ent tumors were used to con rm our ndings. CAFs signicantly increased resistance to carbopla \u0000n and enriched CSCs by increasing their symmetric division as well as dedi eren \u0000a\u0000on of bulk ovarian cancer cells. An limi\u0000ng dilu\u0000on assay demonstrated vivo tumor ini\u0000a \u0000on capacity of the ovarian cancer cells by 10-fold. The CSC-CAF crosstalk responsible for CSC induc\u0000on was found to be mediated by Wnt5a signaling. CRISPR knockdown of Wnt5a the of with ROR2, a Wnt coreceptor, respond to Wnt5a signaling triggered by CAFs and developed into CSCs. Responders were found to signal through a non-canonical Wnt pathway involving the coreceptor ROR2, protein kinase C (PKC), and cAMP Responsive Element Binding Protein 1 (CREB1). Inhibi\u0000on of each of them prevented CSC induc\u0000on and func\u0000onal rescue experiments conrmed the sequence of the Wnt5a-ROR2-PKC-CREB1 axis. Treatment of mouse xenogra \u0000s, established by co-injec\u0000on of CAFs and ovarian cancer with the Wnt5a inhibitor sensi\u0000zed them to carbopla \u0000n, and eliminated the CSCs in the residual tumors. Our results indicate that CAF-derived Wnt5a is instrumental in ovarian cancer CSC growth and maintenance. Since this mechanism can replenish CSC by increasing their symmetric division as well as s \u0000mula \u0000ng dedi eren eec\u0000vely prevents tumor relapse a \u0000er cytotoxic chemotherapy. In the long term, our studies will broaden the understanding of the mechanism of CSC maintenance by the tumor microenvironment and contribute towards the development of novel therapeu\u0000c approaches to prevent ovarian cancer chemoresistance and relapse.

Translational/Clinical Research Graduate StudentPOSTER #75 DEFINING THE MECHANISTIC ROLE OF HEAT SHOCK FACTOR 1 (HSF1) IN METASTATIC BREAST CANCER COLONIZATION. Natasha Hockaden1 1 Medical Sciences, Bloomington, IN Email: nhockade@iu.edu Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Approximately 20-30% of patients will develop metastases and metastasis is responsible for greater than 90% of breast cancer deaths. Metastasis is a complex process in which the cells combat many forces to survive and spread to different areas of the body. Metastatic colonization is the rate-limiting step of metastasis and is an inefficient process in which most cells die and only a small fraction of those that survive can form metastases. Our lab has previously shown that heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is involved in the early steps of breast cancer metastasis, particularly invasion, by promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Utilizing an HSF1 gene expression signature that assesses HSF1 transcriptional activity, we further found that patients with high HSF1 activity have significantly worse metastasis-free survival, further suggesting HSF1 may play a role in metastasis. The physiological function of HSF1 is to regulate the cellular stress response to aid in cell survival in response to external stressors. We have also published that HSF1 can regulate the breast cancer stem cell populations. Because of these functions and the fact that the process of metastatic colonization is known to involve the stem cell population and incur external stressors, we hypothesized that HSF1 may function in metastatic colonization in addition to EMT and metastatic dissemination. To test this, we injected human breast cancer MDA- MB-231 cells with or without HSF1 knockdown into the left ventricle of nude mice. This model injects cells directly into the circulation allowing for assessment of metastatic tumor formation in which the major barrier will be metastatic colonization. We observed that cells without HSF1 had a significantly reduced metastatic burden, indicating HSF1 is necessary for the completion of metastasis and colonization. Consistent with these findings, bone metastatic tumor specimens from patients show increased HSF1 activation compared to their matched primary breast tumors. The mechanism by which HSF1 enables metastatic colonization is unknown. Metastatic colonization likely requires at least two stages that include tumor initiation (or early colonization) characterized by the seeding of a tumor followed by tumor expansion (or late colonization) characterized by rapid proliferation and an increase in tumor size. We aim to identify in which of these stages is HSF1 activated and what mechanism initiates HSF1 activity. We hypothesize that HSF1 may be activated by protein aggregation induced by the stressors during colonization. We will also test the contribution of HSF1-driven stemness in this process. Because we see HSF1 hyperactivation in metastatic tumors and HSF1 is required for completion of metastasis, we also will test whether HSF1 is a viable therapeutic target in preclinical models of metastatic breast cancer.

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related death in women. Cytotoxic CD8+ T cell in ltra \u0000on in breast tumors improve pa \u0000ent outcome and reduces cancer progression. Our previous work has linked the transcrip \u0000on factor HSF1 to breast cancer progression and metastasis. We also recently observed that when HSF1 ac\u0000vity is high there are less genes enriched for cytotoxic immune cells in breast tumors. We observed this nega \u0000ve rela \u0000onship between HSF1 in several computa \u0000onal datasets as well as a cohort of primary breast cancer pa \u0000ent specimens. To func\u0000onally test this rela \u0000onship between HSF1 and CD8+ T cells, HSF1 was knocked down using shRNA in 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells and injected into the mammary fat pad of Balb/c mice. Tumors with HSF1 knockdown had lower tumor volumes and increased CD8+ T cell in ltra \u0000on. To test the func\u0000onal role of the rela \u0000onship between HSF1 and CD8+ T cell presence, 4T1 cells with HSF1 knockdown were injected into Balb/ca mice with or without T cell deple\u0000on.

To ascertain the importance of CCL5 in HSF1-regulated suppression of CD8+ T cell recruitment, we observed that condi\u0000oned medium from 4T1 cells with HSF1 knockdown increases migra \u0000on of assay. migra \u0000on indica \u0000ng that CCL5 is a primary mechanism CD8+ T cell recruitment with HSF1 knockdown. HSF1 ChIP-Seq indicates HSF1 does not directly target CCL5 gene promoter but NF-B is a canonical regulator of CCL5 gene expression. We, and others, have observed that HSF1 can suppress the ac\u0000vity of NF-B. Therefore, we hypothesize that HSF1 indirectly regulates CCL5 levels via suppression of the the NF-B pathway. Therefore, our study points to HSF1 as a novel regulator of tumor interac\u0000on with the immune system and may indicate therapeu\u0000cally targe \u0000ng HSF1 may enhance immune checkpoint therapy by increasing immune cells within tumors.

Immortaliza \u0000on is the rst event during cancer initiation. Our understanding of genomic events during cancer ini\u0000ation including immortalization is still very limited. The goal of this study is to iden\u0000fy genomic events during cancer initiation using an isogenic breast cancer progression model star \u0000ng with primary breast epithelial cells from healthy women. Methods:RNA sequencing was performed with primary breast epithelial cells isolated from core biopsies of seven healthy women of diverse genetic ancestry and their immortalized counterparts. Various filters were applied to identify functionally important genes transcriptionally deregulated during immortalization. Publicly available cancer transcriptome databases and CRISPR screens were used to determine cancer relevance and gene essentiality, respectively, of differentially expressed genes. Chromosome 8q24.3 localized gene TONSL (Tonsoku like, DNA Repair Protein) was identified as a top hit and was further verified for its role during immortalization by overexpressing in primary breast epithelial cells. TONSL mediated changes in epigenome, transcriptome, and immortalization were studied ATAC and TRAP (Telomeric Repeat Amplification Protocol) assay, respectively. Therapeutic effect of targeting TONSL was studied in vivo and in vitro using two breast cancer cell lines with (MD-436, HCC1937), and without (MD-231, MD-468) anticancer drug which targets TONSL-FACT complex and shown clinical efficacy in a Phase I trial. Results: Over 1,500 unique genes were differentially expressed between primary and immortalized cells; ~700 of which were upregulated in the latter. Differentially expressed genes were integral part of cancer-related pathways such as growth, cell cycle, death, and survival. TONSL, which has previously been co-implicated during UV-induced DNA damage, homologous recombination during replication-associated DNA damage, demonstrated elevated expression in immortalized cells compared to primary cells and further upregulated in RAS transformed cells. TONSL-induced transcriptome/epigenome changes in primary cells revealed its role in altering expression of genes in the DNA repair pathways and cell cycle control of chromosome replication. TONSL overexpressing cells exhibited higher telomerase activity compared to primary cells and their transformation with defined oncogenes generated ER+ invasive ductal carcinoma in NSG mice. Breast cancer cell lines with chr8q24.3 amplification were sensitive to CBL0137 in vivo and in vitro .Conclusion: This study iden\u0000ed TONSL as an immortalizing oncogene as its upregula for immortaliza \u0000on. CBL0137 could be developed as a therapy for ~20% of breast cancers that have TONSL amplica \u0000on.

Ovarian cancer stem cells (OCSCs) are hypothesized to be largely responsible for the emergence of chemoresistant tumors, and we have previously shown that OCSCs contribute to recurrent, drug resistant HGSOC using aldehyde dehydrogenase that oxidizes toxic aldehydes to carboxylic acids and plays a role in controlling cell di eren \u0000a\u0000on pathways. However, the mechanism by which ALDH1A1 maintains stemness phenotype remains poorly understood. To examine the e ect of ALDH1A1 upregula \u0000on on cellular survival signals in OCSCs, we used a novel ALDH1A1-specic small molecule inhibitor named compound 974. Treatment of HGSOC cell lines with compound 974 reduced (p<0.01) cispla \u0000n treatment. To further examine the e ect of compound 974 to inhibit ALDH1A1 and consequently tumor ini\u0000a \u0000on, mice were injected with 106, 105 and 104 OVCAR3 cells treated in vitro with compound 974 (5\u00b5M for 48h). In a parallel study, mice were injected with 106, 105 and 104 of ALDH1A1 knockdown or scrambled control cells. In both cases, ALDH1A1 inhibi\u0000on led to a signicant delay in tumor ini\u0000a \u0000on compared to the control. Extreme limi\u0000ng dilu\u0000on analysis revealed that ALDH1A1 inhibi\u0000on reduced (p<0.05) CSC frequencycompared to control. To understand the mechanism by which ALDH1A1 maintains OC stemness,OVCAR3 cells treated with vehicle or compound 974 were analyzed by RNA-sequencing and bioinforma \u0000cs. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that compound 974 signicantly (FDR < 0.05, fold change >2) downregulated expression of markers strongly associated KLF4, SOX9, FZD7) and chemoresistance (ABCB1). for downstream regulators of di eren \u0000ally expressed genes revealed senescence pathway as one of signicantly altered pathways. Analysis by qRT-PCR revealed that compound 974 inhibited (p<0.01) chemotherapy-induced expression marker and also inhibited (p<0.05) the chemotherapy induced beta-galactosidase ac\u0000vity. By using a specic inhibitor, we conclude that ALDH1A1 plays a func\u0000onal role in OCSC biology in general and for the rst \u0000me describe a role for part of a therapeu\u0000c strategy to inhibit tumor relapse and overcome Graduate StudentPOSTER #79 Seiden1, Patrick Getty2, Christopher Collier1, Ed Greenfield1 1 School Of Medicine, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN 2 Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH Email: eseiden@iu.edu Introduction: Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor and predominately affects children, adolescents, and young adults. The five-year survival rate of those with detectable pulmonary metastases is only 30%, indicating that standard therapy (MAP: methotrexate, doxorubicin, cisplatin) is not effective in this patient group. It is therefore necessary to identify novel therapies for osteosarcoma that target the progression of pulmonary metastases. Previously, our lab screened 114 FDA-approved anti-cancer drugs to identify agents that decrease the growth of 3D spheroids (sarcospheres) generated from three human highly metastatic osteosarcoma cell lines. Sarcospheres more closely mimic pulmonary metastases compared with a cell monolayer. The top hits from the initial screen included both of the histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi's) that were tested. In follow-up experiments with and without MAP, romidepsin was the most effective of the five FDA-approved HDACi's and the seven that are in clinical trials. Our goal was therefore to further evaluate romidepsin as a potential therapy for metastatic osteosarcoma. Methods: Highly uniform sarcospheres (~400m in diameter) were generated from highly metastatic human cell lines (143B, MG63.3) and primary cells from a canine osteosarcoma by our previously validated centrifugation-based method. Sarcospheres were matured for 24 hours, then incubated with or without romidepsin treatment for 48 hours. Viability was measured using resazurin reduction. Size was assessed by measuring sarcosphere area from brightfield images obtained using the Incucyte\u00ae S3 Live-Cell Analysis System. The Incucyte\u00ae Cytotox Green Dye was used to stain for cell death. Results: Romidepsin decreased viability of sarcospheres generated from the three different highly metastatic osteosarcoma cell lines LM7, MG63.3, and 3 nM, 5nM, and 28 nM respectively. Following 48 hours, high concentrations of romidepsin caused a regression of viability below levels prior to drug treatment. However, the size plateaued, likely due to persistence of dead cells. Consistent with that possibility, Incucyte\u00ae Cytotox Green Dye staining showed that 1 M romidepsin causes cell death throughout the sarcosphere after 48 hours. Over the course of the 48 hour treatment period, we showed that romidepsin dose dependently decreased sarcosphere size beginning at 22 hours. Using cells derived from a primary canine osteosarcoma to generate sarcospheres, we showed that romidepsin treatment decreased viability below levels prior to drug treatment with an IC50 of 77 nM. Discussion: This study identified romidepsin as a promising therapeutic to target the progression of micrometastases in osteosarcoma. These in vitro sarcosphere results show that romidepsin decreases sarcosphere viability and size. These results provide strong justification to pursue future in vivo studies to determine whether romidepsin blocks progression of metastases, and thereby improves survival, in murine and canine osteosarcoma models. Translational/Clinical Research Graduate StudentPOSTER #80 MCAK AS A TARGET Pilrose1, Disha Kuchangi1, Richard Carpenter1, Claire 1 Bloomington, Bloomington, IN Email: jcs12@iu.edu Triple nega \u0000ve breast cancer (TNBC) is the most lethal breast cancer subtype with no targeted therapies available. The standard of care for TNBC is chemotherapy using a combina \u0000on of microtubule poisons and DNA damaging agents. Microtubule poisons, like paclitaxel, were ini\u0000ally thought to func\u0000on by inducing cell cycle arrest during mitosis, and ul\u0000mately, apoptosis. Recent studies, however, suggest that paclitaxel induces lethal levels of aneuploidy in tumor cells. While these drugs are ini\u0000ally e ec\u0000ve in trea \u0000ng cancer, resistant tumors. Iden \u0000fying proteins that limit aneuploidy may therefore be valuable targets for therapeu\u0000c development. One poten \u0000al target is as a therapeu\u0000c target in cancer, we rst probed its expression levels in the TCGA and the GSE47651 breast tumor databases and found MCAK to be highly upregulated in TNBC. High MCAK expression was associated with elevated tumor stage, increased metastasis, and reduced metastasis-free survival. Knockdown of MCAK in mul\u0000ple tumor-derived cell lines an approximate 5-fold reduc\u0000on in the IC50 for paclitaxel, but there was no change in a normal diploid line, sugges \u0000ng MCAK loss has a cancer- specic e ect. Treatment of cells with paclitaxel or knockdown of MCAK each caused an increase in aneuploidy, but combina \u0000on treatments did not have an addi\u0000ve e ect, sugges \u0000ng that another mechanism is likely responsible for the increase in taxane sensi\u0000vity. One possibility is MCAK's recently uncovered role in DNA repair, which would allow MCAK inhibi\u0000on to modulate DNA damage in combina \u0000on with other drugs. Consistent with this hypothesis, bioinforma \u0000cs studies suggest that MCAK expression levels are correlated with a decreased sensi\u0000vity to the topoisomerase inhibitor topotecan, an interac\u0000on we are To iden \u0000fy poten \u0000al for puta \u0000ve MCAK inhibitors and have established three candidate inhibitors that all caused increased aneuploidy in breast cancer cells. At least one of these inhibitors caused a potent reduc\u0000on in colony forma \u0000on assays. In addi\u0000on, preliminary data show that MCAK loss increases aneuploidy in a taxane-resistant cell line, opening the possible u\u0000lity of MCAK inhibitors in pa \u0000ents with taxane-resistant cancers. Collec\u0000vely our work will expand the eld of precision medicine to include aneugenic drugs, while giving treatment op \u0000ons to breast cancer pa \u0000ents with relapsed or drug-resistant disease.

This high death rate is mainly due to extensive metastasis and a high recurrence rate. The standard of care involves debulking surgery and Carbo-Taxol chemotherapy. While most pa \u0000ents respond well ini\u0000ally, some cancer stem cells survive and cause ovarian cancer relapse. Cancer-associated broblasts (CAFs) are key components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) that have been suggested to play important roles in regula \u0000ng tumorigenesis. Moreover, the residual tumors following neoadjuvant chemotherapy are typically bro\u0000c, indica \u0000ng the poten \u0000al role of CAFs in providing a niche for surviving cancer cells. Like cancer cells, CAFs are heterogenous and our research has shown a subpopula \u0000on of CAFs secrete Wnt5a to regulate cancer cells and enrich the cancer stem cell popula \u0000on. My analysis of mul\u0000ple publicly available datasets revealed that CAFs have signicantly higher Wnt5a expression than cancer cells, further con rming the role of CAF-derived Wnt5a in clinical samples. Deconvolu\u0000on of TCGA ovarian cancer data further revealed that the percentage of CAFs in the TME increases with the cancer stage. Deconvolu\u0000on analysis of the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study dataset containing transcriptomic informa \u0000on of chemo-resistant and chemo-sensi\u0000ve pa enrichment in chemoresistant tumors. TUNEL and immunofluorescent staining were done in frozen sec\u0000ons of chemo-na\u00efve ovarian cancer pa \u0000ent tumors and compared to tumors from pa \u0000ents who had received prior chemotherapy. While chemo naive tumors had minimal apopto\u0000c cells, chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in cancer cells was further away from CAFs. Interes \u0000ngly, the cancer cells adjacent to CAFs were spared. Our previous research had shown that Wnt5a triggers cancer stem cell enrichment in two ways. It s \u0000mulates ovarian cancer stem cell self-renewal by promo\u0000ng symmetric division and increases the dedi eren \u0000a\u0000on of subpopula \u0000ons of bulk ovarian iden \u0000fy and characterize the subpopula \u0000ons of CAFs that are capable of inducing stemness and chemoresistance as well as the subpopula \u0000on of ovarian cancer cells that are responsive to these signals, we applied a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) approach. Heterotypic 3D cocultures of pa \u0000ent-derived ovarian cancer cells and CAFs were thus analyzed. We characterized the pathways ac\u0000vated in CAF subpopula \u0000ons with high Wnt5a expression. We also found cancer cell subpopula \u0000ons, that respond to CAF signals and become cancer stem cells, using trajectory analysis. Our research uncovered the heterogeneity of CAFs in ovarian cancer TME and demonstrated the role of certain subpopula \u0000ons that can serve as a cancer stem cell niche, giving rise to disease relapse. My long-term goal is to determine the molecular mechanism of the CAF-cancer stem cell crosstalk and specically target this communica \u0000on to prevent ovarian cancer recurrence and improve pa \u0000ent outcomes.

Lymphadenopathy following the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccina \u0000on that may mimic metastasis or cancer recurrence will result in mul\u0000ple laboratory tests, imaging, and surgical biopsy. It is impera \u0000ve to start understanding the dis \u0000nguishing features of reac\u0000ve lymphadenopathy following COVID-19 vaccina \u0000on compared to the well-known characteris \u0000cs of malignancy. No study to date has inves \u0000gated the incidence and characteris \u0000cs of lymphadenopathy on imaging in children and adolescent young adults (AYA) with cancer or sickle cell disease (SCD) receiving the vaccine. The primary objec\u0000ve of our study was to inves \u0000gate secondary e ects of the COVID-19 vaccine in children with cancer or SCD with regards to physical exam ndings, imaging, and outcomes. Methods: We retrospec\u0000vely analyzed data from Riley Hospital for Children, including pa \u0000ents aged 0-35 with an oncologic or sickle cell diagnosis from January 2017 - December 2020. We inves \u0000gated pa \u0000ents 1) aged 0 < 28 years of age, 2) received any COVID-19 vaccina \u0000on, 3) have an ac\u0000ve or previous oncology or SCD diagnosis and/or 4) a new pa \u0000ent referral for lymphadenopathy 8 weeks post-vaccina \u0000on. Results: We \u0000ed 154 unique pa \u0000ents cancer or SCD who received the COVID-19 vaccina \u0000on. Among these pa \u0000ents the most common oncologic diagnoses were leukemia (n=25, (n=82, 52.3%) and Caucasian (n=113, 73.4%). For those who received imaging (n=57, 37.0%), the majority did not have lymphadenopathy present on imaging (n=152, 98.7%), but for those who did show lymphadenopathy on imaging (n=2, 1.3%) the most common loca\u0000on was axillary (n=2, 100.0%). P zer was the most received vaccine (n=130, 84.4%), followed by Moderna, (n=19, 12.3%), and Johnson and Johnson (n=5, 3.2%). The majority of vaccinated pa \u0000ents did not have a documented reac\u0000on to the vaccine (n=148, 96.1%). Of those who experienced a reac\u0000on (n=4, 3.9%), commonly seen 83.3%). Conclusions: majority of pediatric pa \u0000ents with cancer or SCD who received the COVID-19 vaccine had few side e ects, and those who experienced side e ects were re flec\u0000ve of those seen in the general popula \u0000on. Children with cancer or SCD are prone to severe COVID-19 infec\u0000ons. Hematologists/oncologists hesitant to recommend the COVID-19 vaccina \u0000on to pa \u0000ents should be aware of the post-vaccine course to appropriately guide pa \u0000ents and families.

RAS pathway altera \u0000ons, however, are more common in breast cancer metastasis. The laboratory's recently developed model system demonstrated the ability of RAS but not PIK3CA-induced signals in promo\u0000ng metastasis of breast cancer. Unbiased kinome analyses of isogenic RAS-transformed primary tumor and metasta \u0000c cells and PIK3CA- tumor cells enabled \u0000ng of these kinases may reduce breast cancer metastasis. As a proof-of-principle, the e ect of the CK2 inhibitor Silmitaser\u0000b, which is in clinical trial for COVID-19 and refractory mul\u0000ple myeloma, was tested. Experimental Design: LIMK1, and PIK3CD kinases were compared through Western Blot using the phospho-an \u0000bodies as an indicator of kinase ac\u0000va \u0000on. TKTB34-RAS and MKTB34-RAS cells compared to KTB34-hTERT and TKTB34-PIK3CA cells. The tested concentra \u0000on range for Silmitaser\u0000b (500 nM to 5 \u00b5M) was ine ec\u0000ve in killing the RAS-transformed cells and was overly toxic to \"normal\" cells. Conclusion Poten breast cancer metastasis. However, Silmitaser\u0000b may not be a good candidate as it is more toxic to \"normal\" cells compared to cancer cells. The isogenic \"normal\" and transformed cell line model system described here may help to discover new targets and drugs that kill cancer but not normal cells. Translational/Clinical Research Medical StudentPOSTER #84 PREV ALENCE AND MANAGEMENT OF CONSTIPATION IN A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW Trisha Reddy1, Megan Parod2, Jennifer Belsky 3 1 Department Of Pediatrics, Indiana University School Of Medicine 2 Marian University College Of Osteopathic Medicine 3 Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Indiana University School Of Medicine Email: trreddy@iu.edu Background: Pediatric cancer patients suffer from a wide variety of chemotherapy induced side effects, including constipation. Psychological factors, chemotherapeutic medications, and lifestyle changes are anticipated to play a role in the multifactorial development of constipation. Methotrexate is a common chemotherapy agent administered for leukemia treatment and is primarily eliminated by the kidneys and liver. Failure to clear methotrexate from the body results in toxicities including mouth sores, mucositis, and organ dysfunction. Occasionally, resultant hyperbilirubinemia has been demonstrated, and is thought to contribute to delays in clearance. To date, no studies have examined the correlative relationship between constipation and delayed methotrexate clearance. This study aims to examine the characteristics of chemotherapy induced constipation management, and the relationship between methotrexate delays and constipation. Methods: This single institution, retrospective study, analyzed data from Riley Hospital for Children, including patients aged 0-21 years of age that were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia from January xxx-September 2021. Constipation was defined as no stool for 48 hours in the inpatient Cerner documentation. Results: We investigated 23 unique pediatric oncology patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia average age 6.7 (range 0-26) years. Majority of patients were male (74%), and Caucasian (87%). We captured 57 unique encounters of patients receiving methotrexate with an average of 5-day admissions. Almost a quarter (n= 11, 24.4%) of patients during inpatient admission met our definition of constipation, without a stool for 48 hours, and 0% of patients had a documentation of constipation in a progress note. Of these patients, 10.5% (n=51) experienced a delay in methotrexate clearance. Only 25% of patients had a scheduled constipation medication prescribed, while 55.4% (n=31) had an as needed constipation medication available. Miralax was the most common (86%) medication scheduled and prescribed as needed. In addition, 16.7% of patients (n=9) had an opioid prescribed during admission. Vincristine was the most common chemotherapy agent received (96.4%) in combination with methotrexate. Prior to admission, 47% of patients had historical constipation during previous admissions, and 90% of patients did not have a last stool documented prior to chemotherapy administration. Conclusion: Patients admitted for methotrexate clearance suffered from constipation without appropriate bowel regimens. In addition to their prolonged hospitalizations, they received vincristine which is a known cause of chemotherapy induced constipation. Future prospective studies should focus on appropriate bowel regimens and secondary effects of constipation in pediatric oncology Radovich2, Patrick J.

Overall, patients have favorable survival outcomes, however a small subset develop metastatic disease. Genomic characterization of this very rare, clinically aggressive TET subset is lacking. Herein, we evaluated the clinical and genomic characteristics of metastatic TET (mTET) compared to a large cohort (n = 117) of primary TET (pTET) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Methods: From 2015 to 2020, 52 pts with mTET underwent clinical CLIA-based sequencing using either whole-exome (n = 35), panel-based testing (n = 13) and/or liquid biopsy (n = 22). The specimen was taken from a metastatic organ (n = 34) or relapsed primary mediastinal mass (n = 14); 4 pts had liquid bx only. Data on pTET was derived from the TCGA. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test was used for assessment of PFS, OS. Results: The median age was 56 yrs in mTET (range 32-74) vs. 60 yrs (range 17-84) in TCGA data. The M/F (%) was 40/60 in mTET and 48/52 in TCGA, respectively. Of note, 13 mTET pts had other types of cancer prior or concurrent with TET diagnosis (4-breast, 2-bladder, 5-other) in which radiotherapy (n = 4) and/or chemotherapy (n = 3) was administered prior to TET diagnosis. In our cohort, 19 pts had stage IV A and 33 pts had stage IVB (most common metastatic site was liver in 17 pts). WHO histologic classification was: A = 1, A/B = 3, B1 = 4, B2 = 10, B3 = 12, TC = 18, TC with neuroendocrine feature = 3, and lymphoepithelial carcinoma = 1. WHO B3 and TC histologies were more common in our cohort of mTET than in the TCGA cohort (63% (33/52) vs. 17% (20/1 17), respectively). Pts with TC had worse mOS compare to thymoma (109m vs. 163m, HR = 2.78, P = 0.04). The most common genomic alteration in mTET was TP53 (n = 17, 33%) compared to 3% in TCGA. This was followed by CDKN2A (n = 5, 10%), PIK3CA (n = 4, 8%), CDKN2B (n = 3, and NF1 (n = 3, 6%). All TP53 missense mut functionality was analyzed with polyphen-2 software and 91.6% (22/24) had 98-100% damaging probability. genomic alterations with available or investigational agents (e.g. high TMB; gain-of-function mutations in PIK3CA, CDK4, and were 23% (12/52) of pts. Conclusions: Patients with mTET are associated with more aggressive WHO histology (B3 and TC). Greater frequency of TP53 mutations are observed in mTET compared to pTET. Clinically actionable genomic alterations are frequently seen in mTET suggesting value in the routine sequencing of these patients Translational/Clinical Research 1 School Of Medicine-Bloomington, IN, Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center, Indianapolis, IN Email: frcheng@iu.edu Ovarian cancer (OC) is the deadliest gynecologic malignancy and high-grade serous OC (HGSOC) is its and lethal subtype. About 70% OC pa \u0000ents are diagnosed at a late stage with extensive metastasis, which contributes to the high mortality rate. Ovarian cancer predominantly undergoes transcoelomic metastasis and the omentum - a large fat pad in the peritoneal cavity - is the most common site of metastasis. The the limi\u0000ng step, is s\u0000ll poorly understood. Since most OC pa \u0000ents will be treated for metasta \u0000c disease, a be \u0000er understanding of the key regulators would result in more e ec\u0000ve therapies. During metasta \u0000c coloniza \u0000on, cancer cells must rst successfully adapt to the new microenvironment before they can eventually develop into the metasta \u0000c tumor. This requires produc\u0000ve cross-talk between the OC and the metasta \u0000c the metasta \u0000c microenvironment would be expected to play a key role. Using an organotypic 3D culture model of the omentum mimicking metasta \u0000c coloniza \u0000on combined with the end point analysis of matched primary tumors and metastases from HGSOC pa \u0000ents, we iden factor regula \u0000ng these genes.

The top TFs predicted to bind to the newly open chroma \u0000n regions were Fos and c-Jun. We have performed a c-Jun CUT&RUN in HGSOC cells seeded on the 3D culture model and overlapped the results with the ATAC-seq data, to iden \u0000fy the direct targets of c-Jun that are induced by microenvironmental signals. HGSOC cells co- culture with microenvironment cells and condi\u0000oned medium (CM) experiments revealed that paracrine signals from mesothelial cells and cancer associated as the key paracrine analysis of the secretomes cells, that c-Jun regulated migra \u0000on, invasion through the outer layers of the omentum and colony forma \u0000on on the omentum.

Using an organotypic 3D culture model of the human omentum, we have studied the produc\u0000ve cross-talk between metastasizing OC cells and its microenvironment cri\u0000cal for establishment of metastasis. To iden \u0000fy the clinically relevant microRNAs that can regulate both early and advanced metastasis, we combined our 3D omentum culture approach with the end point analysis of microRNA expression proles of matched primary and metasta \u0000c tumors from 42 OC pa \u0000ents. miR-193b key microRNA thus iden \u0000ed to the ability of the OC cells to invade through the outer layers of the omentum and increased cancer stem cell-like phenotype. Stably overexpressing miR-193b in OC xenogra \u0000s while stable inhibi\u0000on had iden mechanism the condi\u0000oned medium experiments, inhibi\u0000on, and experiments. Basic FGF (bFGF), IGF binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) and IGF binding protein 6 (IGFBP6) were the key mesothelial factors that were responsible for the downregula \u0000on of miR- 193b in cancer cells. These factors were found to ac\u0000vate ERK in the cancer cells that induced EZH2 and DNMT1 expression. Using ChIP and MeDIP , we discovered that EZH2 induces H3K27me3 in the miR-193b promoter, which helps recruit DMNT1 that catalyzes DNA methyla \u0000on at the miR-193b promoter. Having established the mechanism of miR-193b downregula \u0000on by the microenvironment, we proceeded to study the mechanism by which its decrease promotes metastasis. By performing RNA-seq (CCND1) as a key target, which was validated at RNA and protein levels. Knockdown of CCND1 mimicked the decreased expression of stem cells (ALDH1A1, OCT4, SOX2 stem cells upon miR-193b inhibi\u0000on could be rescued by simultaneous overexpression of CCND1.

Due to intratumoral transduc\u0000on pathways within MPNSTs, exis \u0000ng chemotherapeu\u0000c and targeted agents have thus far not been successful. The 5-year pa \u0000ent survival rate of 35%-50% dictates the need for novel and e ec\u0000ve targets for this disease. One such target is Ref-1 (redox factor-1) which regulates two transcrip \u0000on factors that are important in driving MPNST, Ac\u0000vator is high in MPNST pa \u0000ent samples. Knockdown of these genes in MPNST lines resulted in decreased prolifera \u0000on, wound healing, and tumor signaling. Further, there is crosstalk between these pathways as STAT3 knockdown also a ected the expression of HIF1a and malignant phenotypes, showing the importance of these transcrip \u0000on factors of Ref-1 to block transcrip \u0000on of MPNST survival genes driven by HIF1a and STAT3. We showed in our recent publica \u0000on that Ref-1 inhibi\u0000on reduces expression of genes highly expressed in MPNST compared to benign NF1-derived inhibit forma \u0000on in vitro and APX2009 blocks in vivo tumor growth.

Translational/Clinical Research Post-Doctoral/Medical FellowPOSTER #89 A PILOT STUDY IN THE USE OF FENTANYL PRE-MEDICATION TO DECREASE BROWN ADIPOSE TISSUE UPTAKE OF 18-FDG TRACER IN PEDIATRIC LYMPHOMA PATIENTS William Gaylord1, Jennifer Belsky1, Justin Sims2, Lindsay Blazin1, Courtney Frye3 1 Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Riley Hospital For Children, Indianapolis, IN 2 Clinical Radiology And Imaging Sciences, Riley Hospital For Children, Indianapolis, IN 3 Pediatric Critical Care, Riley Hospital For Children, Indianapolis, IN Email: wcgaylor@iu.edu Background: Brown fat is a metabolically active tissue, resulting in uptake of the 18-FDG tracer used in PET- CT scans, which may lead to uncertainty on scans in children. Brown fat has been found in 34-40% of children, causing oncologists difficulties interpreting scans. Retrospective studies investigating the use of fentanyl in attempt to decrease Brown fat uptake, reported decreasing incidence from 34-40% to 7-10%. We conducted an institutional pilot study to investigate safety, feasibility, and report characteristics of brown fat with fentanyl pre-medication in pediatric lymphoma patients. Methods: This single center, prospective study, investigated PET scans performed on patients aged 6 year to 25 years old with a presumed or confirmed diagnosis of lymphoma from April to July 2021 utilizing a fentanyl protocol with the Pediatric Sedation team at Indiana University North Campus. Patients <25kg received 1mg/kg of IV fentanyl and for patients 25kg, a dose of 0.75mg/kg up to 50mg maximum was given. Patients received fentanyl 10 minutes prior to tracer injection and vitals were recorded along with times of fentanyl injection, 18-FDG tracer injection, and through patient recovery. Results: A total of 9 unique pediatric lymphoma (6 Hodgkin's 1 Burkitt's B-Cell Lymphoma) patients aged 13-18 years old (median 14 years) were eligible to receive fentanyl pre-treatment. 1 patient was deemed ineligible by Sedation Team secondary to superior vena cava syndrome. A total of 10 scans on 8 unique pediatric were performed with fentanyl. Fentanyl was given 10-18 minutes prior to tracer (mean 11.9 min). Patients had no serious adverse events during or following fentanyl intervention. 1 patient reported dizziness after fentanyl injection that resolved after 5 minutes, with normal vital signs during the event. No residual fentanyl sedative effects were observed prior to patients proceeding into the PET scanner. No patients required additional recovery time after the scan. In the group receiving fentanyl, 90% of patients had no reportable brown fat uptake. The brown fat that was observed was present in cervical and thoracis areas and was not seen on a subsequent scan later in the patient therapy that was also done with fentanyl pre-treatment. Conclusion: In this small cohort, fentanyl was found to be safe and feasible as a pre-treatment agent to mitigate brown fat interference on PET scan. We observed decreased uptake of tracer by brown fat in pediatric lymphoma patient that were similar to previously reported data on fentanyl. There were no serious adverse events and no increased time added to their visit. Large multi-center, randomized control trials are warranted to investigate fentanyl pre-treatment efficacy compared to other agents currently in use.

Mul\u0000ple studies have shown increased survival among pa \u0000ents who undergo transplant compared to those who receive chemotherapy alone. Despite the e cacy associated with transplant among popula \u0000ons in totality, individual response to therapy is variable. Recent studies have demonstrated that achieving minimal residual disease (MRD) nega \u0000vity is associated with increased survival in mul\u0000ple myeloma. In this study, we performed a retrospec\u0000ve analysis on pa \u0000ents with mul\u0000ple myeloma with mul\u0000ple myeloma that underwent treatment with high-dose melphalan followed by autologous stem cell transplanta \u0000on at the Indiana University Simon Cancer Center between 2019-2020 were included in the analysis. Pa \u0000ent demographics, disease characteris \u0000cs, pre-transplant and post- transplant laboratory values, and approximately day +100 post-transplant bone marrow sample results were collected. MRD analysis on post-transplant bone marrow aspira \u0000ons was performed using an 8 color flow cytometry panel with 10 markers. The limits of quan \u0000ca \u0000on and detec\u0000on were calculated at 5X10-6 and 2X10-6. \u0000vity was de ned tes \u0000ng. was performed to variables with \u0000c regression was markers with a p-value <0.25 in univariate analysis.

Among all pa \u0000ents, age at transplant, gender, race, body mass index, glomerular ltra \u0000on rate on melphalan dose received, and immunoglobulin subtype were not associated with response to therapy. Pre- transplant M protein posi\u0000vity was associated with a higher likelihood of post-transplant MRD posi\u0000ve status with an odds ra \u0000o of 24.32 (p<0.0001). When restric\u0000ng analysis to include only pa \u0000ents at VGPR status or less prior to transplant, pre-transplant M-protein posi\u0000vity and increased age at transplant were associated with increased likelihood of MRD posi\u0000ve status with odd (p=0.0366) M protein via serum protein electrophoresis is associated with an increased likelihood of having posi\u0000ve MRD following autologous stem cell transplanta \u0000on in mul\u0000ple myeloma.

Of Pediatrics, IU Center For Bioethics, Indiana University School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN Email: meaemill@iu.edu Background: Vaccination against human papilloma virus (HPV) is the most important preventative measure to protect individuals against the development of HPV related cancers. Notably, data suggests that pediatric cancer survivors may be more likely to develop a second primary HPV-related cancer than the general population. Despite this risk, a retrospective chart review of patients 11-26 years of age at RileyHospital for Children'ssickle cell disease (SCD) and oncology survivorship clinics rates of HPV vaccination, with only 47% and 42% of patients up to date in SCD and survivor clinics, respectively. In community settings, a strong provider recommendation has been shown to increase vaccination rates;therefore, we sought to understand pediatric hematology/oncology physician and nurse practitioner views and experiences with the HPV vaccine. Methods: We completed 20 semi-structured qualitative interviews with 18 pediatric hematology/oncology physicians and 2 nurse practitioners. Interviews were subsequently transcribed and analyzed via thematic content analysis. The interviews assessed providers' experiences, approaches, attitudes, views, and barriers related to HPV vaccination. Results: Participants identified barriers at the provider, clinic, and institutional levels. The most common identified provider specific barrier to HPV vaccination was lack of continuing education on this subject. Additionally, most subspecialty providers believe that HPV vaccination should fall under the purview of the PCP and HPV vaccine was not included in stem cell transplant revaccination protocols. Clinic level barriers included lack of time and flow constraints, as well as having the ancillary staff resources and trainings to administer the vaccine. Commonly cited institutional barriers to vaccination included a lack of access to HPV vaccine, capacity to store vaccines in the clinic, and access to vaccine records. Conclusions: Provider-specific barriers can beimprovedthrough continuing education on how to effectively recommend HPV vaccination and through clinic-based policies promoting vaccination.Clinic and institutional barriers can be addressed byimproving accessibility of the vaccinein clinicandrefining the these barriersis of the upmost importance tohelp increase vaccination rates in this patient population.

However, accurately calling PGx alleles from WES remains challenging. In this study, we assessed the accuracy of Aldy, a computational tool to call PGx star alleles and diplotypes from WES, for 13 major PGx genes. Methods Germline DNA was obtained from whole blood and used for both CAP and CLIA-accredited WES using custom xGen target capture with Illumina NovaSeq 6000 and OpenArrays targeted genotyping for 75 subjects from the IU Health Precision Oncology Clinic. Aldy v3.3 was installed on the LifeOmic Precision Health Cloud pla\u0000orm to call PGx star alleles and diplotypes from WES. Aldy could not call copy number from WES, so Aldy was xed to call two copies per gene. We compared Aldy results from WES with targeted genotyping for 57 star-de ning variants within CYP2B6 (3), NUDT15 (3), SLCO1B1 (1), and TPMT (3), yielding a total of 3,737 variant genotypes and 899 diplotype calls. Results WES read depth was >100x for all except For the 752 diplotype calls containing only alleles assessed by both Aldy 147 diplotype calls within CYP2B6 (28), CYP2C9 (2), SLCO1B1 (19), and TPMT (1). Eleven diplotypes were excluded from the analysis due to copy number varia \u0000on in CYP2D6 genotyping. Two CYP2D6 diplotypes were excluded from the analysis due to ambiguous phasing that prevented precise determina \u0000on of the diplotype. Conclusion Aldy accurately called star alleles anddiplotypes for 13 major PGx genes from clinical WES, thus allowing repurposing of WES to support clinical PGx. A current limitation of Aldy, and other algorithmic-based methods to extract PGx information, is the inability to accurately determine changes in copy number from WES.Translational/Clinical Research Post-Doctoral/Medical FellowPOSTER AND -LAPACHONE-INDUCED OXIDATIVE DNA Wang2,3, Xiumei Huang2,3 1 Biochemistry And Molecular Biology, Indiana University School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 2 Radiation Oncology, Indiana University School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 3 Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center Email: xiasu@iu.edu -Lapachone is a classic quinone-containing antitumor NQO1-bioactivatable drug that directly kills NQO1- overexpressing cancer cells. However, the clinical applications of -lapachone are primarily limited by its high toxicity and modest lethality. To overcome this side effect and expand the therapeutic utility of - lapachone, we demonstrate the effects of a novel combination therapy including -lapachone and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) inhibitor T2 amino alcohol (T2AA) on various NQO1+ cancer cells. PCNA has DNA clamp processivity activity mediated by encircling double-stranded DNA to recruit proteins involved in DNA replication and DNA repair. In this study, we found that compared to monotherapy, a nontoxic dose of the T2AA synergized with a sublethal dose of -lapachone in an NQO1-dependent manner and that combination therapy prevented DNA repair, increased double-strand break (DSB) formation and induced catastrophic energy loss. We further determined that T2AA promoted programmed necrosis and G1 phase cell cycle arrest in -lapachone-treated NQO1+ cancer cells. Our findings show novel evidence for a new therapeutic approach that combines of -lapachone treatment with PCNA inhibition that is highly effective in treating NQO1+ solid tumor cells.

Wells Center For Pediatric Research, IU School Of Medicine 3 Indiana University Melvin And Bren Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center, In Vivo Therapeutics Core 4 Indiana Institute Of Personalized Medicine Email: ssupples@iu.edu Outcomes for children with relapsed alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) remain poor with survival rates below 20% with current salvage therapy regimens. More e ec\u0000ve therapies are urgently needed. The majority of ARMS tumors harbor the aberrant transcrip \u0000onal fusion protein PAX3-FOXO1 (fusion-posi\u0000ve ARMS), which confers a par\u0000cularly poor prognosis. PAX3-FOXO1 mediates the expression of downstream target genes including IGF1R, MET, FGFR4, ALK, MYOD1, and MYCN . BRD4, a member of the BET protein family of epigene \u0000c readers, directly interacts with PAX3-FOXO1 at enhancer regions and serves as a cri\u0000cal co-ac\u0000vator of target gene transcrip \u0000on. Treatment with small molecule BET inhibitors (BETi), results in loss of this interac\u0000on and fusion protein degrada \u0000on, as well as ARMS tumor suppression both in vitro and in vivo, ra \u0000onalizing BET proteins as a therapeu\u0000c target in ARMS. However, reports of adap \u0000ve resistance mechanisms to BETi monotherapy are emerging and an \u0000-tumor e ects trials are short-lived, sugges \u0000ng that combina \u0000on therapy will be required to successfully treat ARMS. To that end, topotecan, a well-established agent used in ARMS salvage therapy, was selected for combina \u0000on with the highly potent, bivalent BRD4-specic topoisomerase I (TOP1) inducing double-strand DNA breaks and subsequent cell death. BRD4 also plays a role in repair of double-strand breaks, further ra \u0000onalizing this combinatorial approach. We hypothesize that targe with the BETi AZD5153 in combina \u0000on with the salvage chemotherapy topotecan serve as an ecacious and well-tolerated therapeu\u0000c op \u0000on in preclinical models of relapsed ARMS.

Upcoming experiments will evaluate AZD5153 plus topotecan in combina \u0000on in our PDX will further inves the BET/BRD4-dependent an \u0000-tumor mechanisms in ARMS. Informa \u0000on gained in this project will be highly clinically relevant, and should provide preclinical ra \u0000onale for clinical trials to ul\u0000mately improve outcomes for pa \u0000ents with aggressive ARMS.

High grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), the most common OC epithelial subtype, is a highly aggressive disease characterized by a high frequency of TP53 driver muta \u0000ons (50%), genomic instability, and rapid tumor growth with a propensity for widespread peritoneal metastasis and marked chemoresistance. A dismal 20% survival rate for women diagnosed with advanced disease underscores an urgent need to devise novel treatment strategies. The MYC proto- oncogene is amplied in > 60% of HGSOC. In addi\u0000on to MYC, the gene for heat shock factor 1 (HSF1 ), a master regulator of the heat shock response, is reported to have pro-tumor func\u0000ons in several cancer types, including OC. In our preliminary studies using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we have found that HSF1 is amplied 40% OC and of MYC correlated in OC cell lines (r=0.82, p=0.0019), with and HSF1 co-amplica \u0000on have worse recurrence-free survival independent of age (mul\u0000variable HR=1.549, p=0.013) leading us to hypothesize that that MYC and HSF1 cooperate to promote OC tumor growth and progression.

BI-6727 is a highly selec\u0000ve PLK1 inhibitor that has been well-tolerated in clinical trials. Using cell viability, two-dimensional growth, and a three-dimensional spheroid assay we report that MYC-HSF1 co-amplied ovarian cancer had increased sensi\u0000vity to BI-6727 compared to non- amplied cells. In a subcutaneous nude mouse model of ovarian cancer, we also observed a signicant decrease in MYC-HSF1 co-amplied OVCAR8 tumor volume a \u0000er 20mg/kg BI-6727 treatment compared to vehicle control as early as 14 days.

Thus far, neuroscience research has been mostly conducted using poorly translatable animal models and immortalized cell lines due to the limited availability of viable human nerve \u0000ssue. iPSC-derived cultures, however, are highly variable due to di erences in culture condi\u0000ons, such as star\u0000ng iPSC passage number, i.e., the \"age\" of an iPSC In this study, we inves \u0000gated the \u0000mize the genera \u0000on of func\u0000onal, mature peripheral sensory neurons. Three iPSC lines were di eren \u0000ated into sensory neurons (iPSC-dSNs) at each of three di erent passage numbers within the following ranges: low (LP; and pluripotency of the iPSCs, as well as the maturity and func\u0000onality of the di eren \u0000ated iPSC-dSNs, were compared across numbers. Immunofluorescent staining for neuronal markers peripherin and III-tubulin was expression of pluripotency factors Sox2, Oct3/4, and Nanog was assessed by flow cytometry and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Expression of immature neuron markers NTRK1 PAX6 , mature neuron markers RUNX1 NEFH was Finally, the func\u0000onal maturity of the iPSC-dSNs was also assessed based on electrophysiological proper\u0000es. All parent iPSC lines at each passage number displayed the same expected morphology and there were no sta \u0000s\u0000cally signicant di erences in the pluripotency of these lines, sugges \u0000ng that passage number does not a ect the quality of the star\u0000ng iPSCs. The di eren \u0000ated iPSC-dSNs were also morphologically comparable across passage numbers There were no obvious di erences in staining pa \u0000ern or intensity of III-tubulin or peripherin, and no sta \u0000s\u0000cally signicant di the expression of TUBB3 (III-tubulin) or PRPH (peripherin), except for a signicantly higher level of TUBB3 in the HP iPSC-dSNs. However, compared to MP and HP iPSC-dSNs, LP iPSC-dSNs exhibited signicantly higher expression of NTRK1 at day 3 post-induc\u0000on, signicantly lower expression of both NTRK1 and PAX6 at day 33 post-induc\u0000on, and signicantly higher expression of the mature and sensory neuron markers listed above at day 33. LP iPSC- dSNs also demonstrated signicantly higher func\u0000onality based on electrophysiology data. These data indicate that LP iPSC-dSNs achieved signicantly greater maturity and be \u0000er recapitulated the desired peripheral sensory neuron phenotype. In conclusion, lower passage numbers may be be \u0000er suited for di eren \u0000a\u0000on into peripheral sensory neurons. Further studies are warranted to elucidate factors contribu\u0000ng to this variability associated with iPSC passage number, such as genomic stability and epigene\u0000c memory, which may help to improve the reliability and consistency of iPSC-derived models.

The low survival rate is largely due to advanced stage detection upon diagnosis. Improved treatment options remain essential in combating the disease and bolstering patient outcomes. Nanoparticle albumin bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) is a next-generation taxane receiving attention for its potential in EAC treatment. Nab-paclitaxel has exhibited greater specificity for targeting cancer cells while decreasing cytotoxic effects to adjacent healthy populations. Unfortunately, chemoresistance remains an issue surrounding adequate treatment regimes. Epinephrine and its receptor, 2 adrenergic, have been shown to dysregulate various oncogenic pathways and reduce chemotherapeutics efficacy. Typically associated with pain management and addiction treatment, methadone hydrochloride has been investigated for its potential to block the oncogenic effects of epinephrine and strengthen the impact of chemotherapeutics. In this study, we evaluated the enhancement of apoptosis by the combination of nab-paclitaxel and methadone, and the ability of methadone to block epinephrine-induced chemoresistance. Methods: Immunoblot analyses were performed to elucidate EAC cell lines with the greatest expression of Mu opioid and 2 adrenergic receptors. WS T-1 assays were utilized to investigate adequate dosages of methadone and epinephrine for the EAC cell lines and to determine cell growth under co- administration of nab-paclitaxel and methadone as well as methadone and epinephrine. Immunoblotting was performed to assess the apoptotic effect of single drug and combination treatments by cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved poly-ADP ribose polymerase phosphorylation levels of extracellular signal-regulated Propidium iodide cell viability flow to detect apoptosis. Results: OE19 and OE33 cell lines showed increased expression of Mu and 2 adrenergic receptors, ensuring the cells were capable of binding to methadone or epinephrine. WS T-1 assays nM of methadone as optimal dosages for both cell lines. Our previous studies demonstrated that about 5.85 mM of nab-paclitaxel (5mg/mL) induces apoptosis in OE19 and of caspase-3 cleaved PARP under co- administration of nab-paclitaxel and methadone as well as decreased expression under epinephrine and methadone treatment. Furthermore, immunoblotting revealed decreased phosphorylation of CREB and ERK under combination treatment of methadone compared to single-dose epinephrine. Propidium iodide staining combination treatment of nab- paclitaxel and methadone.Conclusions: The current study confirmed the efficacy of NPT for the treatment of EAC, demonstrated methadone's ability to block epinephrine-induced proliferation and showed an enhanced effect on apoptosis when combining nab-paclitaxel with methadone in EAC treatment. Translational/Clinical Research Research TechnicianPOSTER #98 INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTS OF ARSENIC EXPOSURE ON HUMAN BLADDER CELLS AND THE MECHANISMS OF ARSENIC-INDUCED BLADDER CANCER Haimanti Ray1, Richard Carpenter1,2 1 Medical Sciences Program, School Of Medicine, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN 2 Department Of Biochemistry And Molecular Biology Email: rayh@iu.edu Arsenic occurs naturally in various forms and can be found in soil, groundwater, air, plants, and animals. Humans are o\u0000 en exposed to arsenic through the food, water, and the air we consume and use. Exposure to arsenic has been linked to several cancers, especially lung, skin, and bladder cancer. Although arsenic is considered carcinogenic to humans with regards to these cancer types, there is a lack of research inves \u0000ga\u0000ng the mechanisms by which arsenic leads to cancer, par\u0000cularly in bladder cancer. We found that the transcrip \u0000on factor HSF1 (Heat Shock Factor 1) is ac\u0000vated in response to acute arsenic exposure in human bladder epithelial cells. HSF1 is the master regulator of the heat shock response and helps cells survive in the presence of external stressors. Thus, we hypothesize that HSF1 might be involved in the survival of bladder cells exposed to arsenic. Arsenic exposure can induce DNA altera \u0000ons and the produc\u0000on of reac\u0000ve oxygen species (ROS). Increased HSF1 ac\u0000vity may increase the survival of cells with DNA altera \u0000ons from arsenic exposure and thus may lead to the development of cancer. We will test our hypothesis by examining DNA altera \u0000ons, such as aneuploidy and DNA damage, in response to arsenic exposure as well as how these e ects change in the absence of HSF1 and scavenging of ROS. We will also study the characteris \u0000cs of arsenic-induced bladder cancer by exposing human bladder cells to arsenic over a period of 26 weeks at doses that correspond to the urine arsenic levels of popula \u0000ons in arsenic-exposed areas around the world. These arsenic-exposed bladder cells have shown evidence of transforma \u0000on through increased prolifera \u0000on and clonogenic growth compared to passage-matched control cells. We will use DNA and RNA sequencing of these transformed bladder cells to iden \u0000fy unique pa \u0000erns of muta \u0000ons and expression in response to chronic arsenic exposure.

The 5-year survival rate for epithelial ovarian cancer is 48% and among them, high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most prevalent and lethal subtype. The standard of care for ovarian cancer is a combina \u0000on of cytoreduc\u0000ve surgery and carbo-taxol chemotherapy. The reason for the poor outcome is extensive metastasis and disease relapse. To overcome the clinical limita \u0000ons of pla \u0000num- based an \u0000cancer drugs, (Re) compounds with poten \u0000al an \u0000cancer proper\u0000es have been synthesized in recent years. Many of these Re complexes/compounds display promising cytotoxic proper\u0000es against various cancer cells including brain cancer and breast cancer cells. In the present study, we report our inves \u0000ga\u0000on of the an \u0000cancer ac\u0000vity of these Re compounds against HGSOC cells. Ini\u0000ally, we screened the an\u0000-prolifera assay was done using a range of doses of the Re compounds in these HGSOC cells to determine their IC50 dose. The IC50 values of the compounds ranged between 792.1nM and 7370nM, with PR7 being the most e ec\u0000ve across all cells. It was found to have an IC50 of 792.1nM in OVCAR4, 2088nM in OVCAR8, and 946.1nM in Kuramochi. Subsequently, PR7 was chosen to determine the mechanism of its an \u0000-cancer ac\u0000vity. Treatment with PR7 was found to induce apoptosis in the HGSOC cells. This was determined by western blo\u0000ng for caspase 3 and PARP cleavage using lysates of the HGSOC cells treated with PR7 compared to vehicle control.

Metabolic adaptation can be dramatic for breast-originated lung metastases due to differences in oxygen and nutrient availability. Hypoxia is a selective low-oxygen condition in the tumor microenvironment that enables aggress ive cancer cells to survive and expand their colonies. Patients with hypoxic tumors have a poor prognosis and increased likelihood of metastasis. They also experience resistance to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Studies have shown that hypoxia supports cancer growth by using different mechanisms, such as transforming fibroblasts into tumor-prone cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), g metastases, and attenuating anti-tumor immune function. Although a lot is known about hypoxia, the mechanistic link between hypoxia and metabolic reprograming is still not well understood. In this study, we focused on a gluconeogenic enzyme called pyruvate carboxylase (PC) which converts pyruvate into oxaloacetate. Previously, we have shown that PC expression is higher in oxyge n-rich lung metastases compared to hypoxic primary breast tumors. Thus, herein we utilized RT-PCR, immunoblot, and reporter assays to demonstrate that PC expression is inhibited by hypoxia. To recapitulate loss of PC in a hypoxic TME we utilized an shRNA approach. Metabolomic characterization of these cells using mass spectroscopy demonstrated that depletion of PC caused cells to produce more lactate compared to control cells. Importantly, this directly correlated with the amount of CD4 and CD8 p ositive cells in the tumor microenvironment, le ading to a more immune suppressed TME. As a result depleti on of PC incr eases primary tumor gro wth, a result that can be reversed by inhibi tion of the lactate transporte r MCT1. Together with our prev ious studies, these res ults demonstrate the importance of PC in regulating immu ne suppression in hypoxic tumor microenvironments.

The dynamic changes in matrix properties affect cancer cell migration (e.g., durotaxis and chemotaxis). However, it is still unclear how the interplay between stiffness heterogeneity and chemokine/growth factor gradient govern the migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells. To understand how cancer cells respond to the stiffness increase in the TME, we have previously developed a gelatin-based hydrogel. Gelatin was modified with click chemistry 'handles' - norbornene and hydrazide - that enables gelation and dynamic stiffening of the gel matrix, respectively. As shown in our previous research, oxidized dextran (oDex) was an effective stiffening reagent, thus it was utilized for creating stiffness gradient in the modified gelatin hydrogel to mimic the heterogeneous stiffness of the TME. On the other hand, heparin, a sulfated glycosaminoglycan that sequestrates growth factors/cytokines, was used to create a stable gradient of growth factor/cytokine. Our results show that oDex was able to diffuse into the hydrogel matrix and react with the chemical motif, thus creating a stiffness gradient. Similarly, heparin gradient was created in the same manner, as indicated by the fluorescence intensity of the fluorescent dye-labeled heparin, and dimethylmethylene blue staining. Future direction includes establishment of growth factor/cytokine gradient and evaluate the influence of multi- physicochemical gradients Heterogeneity Human In Vivo Imaging Mahsa Servati1, Emily E Diller2, Jason G Parker3 Indiana University, School Of Medicine, Department Of Radiology And Imaging Sciences, Purdue University, School Of Health Sciences, INDIANAPOLIS, IN Indiana University, School Of Medicine, Department Of Radiology And Imaging Sciences, Indianapolis, IN Indiana University, School Of Medicine, Department Of Radiology And Imaging Sciences, Purdue University, School Of Health Sciences, Indianapolis, IN Email: mservati@iu.edu Human brain tumors exhibit non-uniform somatic and genomic composition across space and time. This intra-tumoral heterogeneity (ITH) enables treatment resistance and disease recurrence, leading to the dismal prognosis and low survival rates of high grade brain tumors. The conventional diagnostic work-up for human brain tumors uses pre-surgical imaging and biopsy to assess cellular and molecular properties so that subsequent chemotherapy and radiation treatments can be optimized for patient-specific mutation profiles. However, these tools cannot identify all of the various somatic and genomic mutations present within a tumor. We hypothesize that cellular and molecular ITH can be described by mapping multimodal and multiparametric in vivo imaging signatures to underlying somatic and genomic aberrations. In this project, we use multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and perfusion and amino acid positron emission tomography (PET) to scan treatment-na\u00efve patients with radiologic-confirmed WHO grade II-IV glioma. A minimum of two tumor samples will be collected from each subject using a stereotactic core biopsy for accurate spatial registration with the pre-surgical image datasets. All collected tumor tissues then undergo whole exome sequencing (WES), array methylation, and RNA sequencing to extract genome-wide association information. The genomic features will be co-registered to pre-surgical MR and PET images, and evaluated using logistic regression, generalized linear models, and non- parametric machine learning. The result will be a generalized patient-independent model linking cross-modality voxel intensity patterns to cellular and molecular information, addressing ITH within the tumor. This clinically validated model will impact the tumor- wide treatment response and improve overall clinical outcomes. "}
