This book offers information and insights through the voices of First Nations and M\u00e9tis people who have lived and are living through a cancer journey, as well as space for your own reflections. When you're faced with cancer, so many people say you have to be positive. You have to be strong. When I found out I had cancer, I thought of all my children and my grandchildren and my great-grandchildren. I ask my Creator to help me every day. And I'm just happy I'm here for another day. And I know we have to be medicine for one another. ~ R everend Lily Bell, Haida NationWe're brave. We're warriors. I'm here today because I decided I am a proud, brave warrior. We have to tell that to our people.

You may have questions. Be gentle with yourself. Depending on your diagnosis, you may need to make decisions quickly. It helps to gather support. Reach out to people you love and trust, and who are good medicine for you. Telling a loved one about your diagnosis may be the first step in your journey. There are many ways to share this information. Some people find it helpful to share with people they trust. Give yourself permission to ask for help from those around you. Ever since I started this fight, I have had great support from my family and my partner of t wenty plus years. I will not give up this fight with cancer. ~ William Samson, Tsimshian, Lax Kw'alaams 78 LIVING WITH C ANCER WHEN THE DOCTOR phoned to tell me about my diagnosis, I was at work. I remember my cell phone ringing or maybe it was my office line. I can't really remember those details. I remember picking up the phone and he told me he got the results back and that I needed to come in for further testing because there were signs of papillary carcinoma. I didn 't have time to process. I just remember feeling lik e I'd been hit by a truck. I didn't have time to think about it. And I wept. I just wept. He opened the space to ask questions but I couldn't really process anything. ~ Amanda Engen, Dene Tha, Chetah A lberta and M\u00e9tis LIVING WITH CANCER 9 THE PERSONAL JOURNEY was difficult, and it's been a long time because I didn't think I could tell people I was angry. I was angry with people who offered me advice. What if I couldn't be strong? What if I can't be cheerful? What if I can't be happy? What if I can't be hopeful? All I can do is be in this moment, whatever it is, and I just need you to be there for me. That's what makes me strong. That's what makes me smile. That's what makes me whole. Thank you. ~ Jan Ovans, M\u00e9tis I just need you to be there for me. That's what makes me strong gathering support10 LIVING WITH C ANCERIF YOU DON'T understand, ask the question because if you don't tell me or ask somebody, we don't know what you need . You have to ask. I've sat in with patients with the doctor, and we talk about it after. They didn't say anything or ask questions so I'll write them down for them and help them make a list of what to ask the doctor. ~ Patient NavigatorAT TIMES IT FEELS like, why is it taking so long for the test results to come in? It feels like everything's going very fast and then at times it feels like time just stopped. ~ Health C are Provider gathering support I think writing down your questions is a good thing. And maybe find somebody who can take you to an appointment or just sit in with you. Write notes for you. It's good to always have that support. ~ Health Care Provider LIVING WITH CANCER 11 I'm a survivor of breast cancer 15 years now. I've also been helping other breast cancer survivors in my community just by being with them, being supportive. I'm finding that communication is really important to get them to connect with people, and I let them know that I understand exactly what they're going through because I was there. I had to lose part of myself in order to live. ~ Maril yn Belleau, Esk'etemc from Alkali LakeI understand exactly what they're going through because I was there. gathering support 12 LIVING WITH C ANCER you may want to ask yourself when diagnosed with cancer Am I experiencing new feelings after being diagnosed with cancer, such as being sad, scared, angry or confused? Do I have someone who I can express my feelings to (parent, grandparent, sister, brother, auntie, niece, uncle, son, daughter, nephew, close friend, counsellor, etc.)? Do I have someone who I can ask to come with me to my appointments to support and advocate for me? Who is my medicine?QUESTIONS when seeking information about your cancer W rite your questions down on a piece of paper before you visit your health care provider, and ask all the questions you may have. You may also want to write the responses to your questions on a piece of paper to help you remember them. Record y our conversations with your health care provider. Most cell phones let you do this. If you need help, ask a family member. The audio recording of your visit may help you remember the answers to your questions if you forget. Bring a family member , friend or support person to your appointments to help you ask questions. They can also help you remember what was said by the health care provider. When seeking information online, be sure to use only credible and reputable information sources, like the BC Cancer Agency or the Canadian Cancer Society websites. TIPS LIVING WITH CANCER 13 you may want to ask your health care provider about your diagnosis What type of cancer do I have? Is my cancer slow or fast growing? What does it mean if my cancer is fast or slow growing? Is my cancer in only one place, or is it in other parts of my body? What does it mean if my cancer has spread to other parts of my body? What are the chances that my cancer will get worse? What are the chances of me surviving this cancer? How many people survive the same type of cancer that I have?QUESTIONS Your notes14 LIVING WITH C ANCER Transporting you to and from appointments. Using your medical team, like at a wellness centre if you live in a remote location. Using a medical team in your local community. They're huge. The emotional and the mental piece of it, you need that support for that. Because the anxiety and being scared of the unknown, it will take you over if you let it. So you need to have a safe place to vent and talk and have that support. I've combined life of recovery after cancer with my own sobriety and spirituality. Leaning on your culture and your tr aditional teachings is huge. Also seeking out people who will support y ou spiritually and physically. LIVING WITH CANCER 15I am a breast cancer survivor! Since January 2013. ~ Dawn Francois, Secwepemc Nation gathering supportI looked at my wellness from that standpoint as well. Even now looking back, alcohol, smoking, drugs and lack of sleeping, it probably did contribute to my cancer diagnosis. The stress and the emotional, the mental piece also, probably contributed too. When you're in addiction, you're in constant chaos. And it comes out in the rest of your body at the same time. I started going to sweats more and smudging more, and praying more. It was a really stressful time.I've combined life of recovery after cancer with my own sobriety and spirituality. It's all interconnected. Around the time that I was diagnosed, I was sober two years. I was discovering my spirituality and the connection to the Creator and the land. I was working my AA program and also eating properly. The dietary piece was huge. I was eating more healthy, more fruits and vegetables, and drinking a lot more water. And I was exercising.16 LIVING WITH C ANCER gathering support I said , 'I do feel afraid.' He said, 'That's okay A untie. Feel however you feel. Don't be ashamed because you feel scared. Just accept whatever feelings come at the moment.' ~ R everend Lily Bell, Haida Nation LIVING WITH CANCER 17The one thing I know from when I was going through this with my niece. It is your cancer. It is your decision and your body. What you need to do on your journey is your decision. This is you. ~ Gail Gus, T seshaht First Nation 18 LIVING WITH C ANCER THE THING that first came to mind and still does: I don't want to hurt anybody. I don't want to put this on anybody else and I don't want anybody to feel guilty about my illness. I had to go to my children first. Even though I was divorced from their dad, he needed to be there for them like I was, and I needed to tell him that. I needed to make sure I had all those bases covered before I started thinking about me. And making it meaningful for them because they're younger so that they would know how they could care and who would care for them as well. It's a huge thing when y ou say cancer. Let's not say the big C. It's cancer. Initials don't mean a thing. It just means that you're covering it up more. That's what it was for me anyway. ~ Gwen Campbell McArthur, Ojibway/Saulteaux M\u00e9tis LIVING WITH CANCER 19 Practical support You may need support with your daily tasks and responsibilities, to take time off work, or be away from family. If you need to travel for tests and treatment, this may require planning and resources. TALKING TO CHILDREN ABOUT CANCER You may feel overwhelmed talking about your cancer, especially if you are managing anxiety and fears brought on from your diagnosis. When talking to children about cancer, you may want to have the support of a loved one or trusted Elder with you. When speaking to children, the age of the child and your knowledge of them should be kept in mind. A conversation with a younger child may be different than with an older child, and it may be different based on their understanding of cancer and their relationship with you. Keeping cancer a secret may be stressful, especially if people around you sense that something is happening to your wellness. It is important to remember that it is your decision who you tell and when. practical support Making sure that everyone is taken care of in a good way ~ Dawn Francois, Secwepemc NationSUPPORTING each other. Sharing all that knowledge, even the financial part of how to use the medical travel that you access through your wellness centre or health station. 20 LIVING WITH C ANCER for discussing your cancer diagnosis with children Discuss the basics and use words that the child can understand. Find out what the child already knows about cancer and clear up any misleading information or myths they may have. Be clear about the name of the cancer, the part of the body that has the cancer, and how it will be treated. Let the child know that it is OK to ask questions, and that feeling worried is a normal reaction to hearing a loved one has cancer. Don't assume children will have the same fears as you. Ask them what they want to know, and try to only answer questions they ask. Tell children if you don't know the answer to a question, and let them know you will find out the answer for them.TIPS Your notes LIVING WITH CANCER 21 Your notes you may want to ask your health care provider about support Are there support people at the cancer centre, such as patient navigators or social workers that I can talk to for support? How can I find support and help for the new thoughts and feelings I am having after being diagnosed with cancer? If I have to fly or travel far for medical appointments, where can I get information on support for transportation and accommodations? Who can help me and my family cope with a cancer diagnosi s, and the changes that accompany it? Are there brochures or pamphlets that can help me learn about my diagnosis and treatment, and the services that are available?QUESTIONS22 LIVING WITH C ANCER ON APRIL 16TH, I got my diagnosis of breast cancer. And I had my mastectomy a week later. Everything just happened so fast. I work with home and community care, and I have a lot of supportive colleagues there. They were there for me any time I needed anything. They would ask if I need my dressing checked because I came to work and still had drains in. My family organized a benefit for me and lots of my co-workers came to that. They got together and they contributed some it ems as well for silent auction. practical support LIVING WITH CANCER 23 They checked on me to make sure everything looked well. They asked how they could support me, even just talking. I think that's what got me through having the diagnosis of breast cancer is staying positive. Now I'm looking forward to having breast reconstruction. My work also supported me going to appointments and stuff. Like with this knee replacement that I also had at that time. So any medical things I go to, they're definitely accommodating when it's time for me to go and do that. ~ Shell y Henderson, Weiwaikum (Campbell River) First Nation 24 LIVING WITH C ANCER I WAS AFRAID, afraid to talk to my children. Ken was worried about me. And it's difficult when you want to be independent. Basically, women all over don't want people to take care of us because we're the caregivers. We're the ones that take care of everybody so it was difficult to get help or even ask for help. But when the Kwakiutl District Council (KDC) staff came they would say, 'I'm just here, I can keep you company, talk to you. And I do have a support person in the Canadian Cancer Society who calls me every few months to ask me what's happening for myself. She's two years ahead of me so she's experienced a lot. So now I can, if I'm afraid of something, I can talk about what I'm going through.The Canadian Cancer Society has been wonderful, wonderful all the way through. They're really supportive and the KDC was great because they sent me people to help me cook and drive me to and from the doctors. They were just there for me. You know, I was grateful people didn't tell me everything. Just little steps help me not to get overwhelmed because I wasn't sure if I was going to have do chemo or radiation. And I was afraid. I was more afraid for my family then I was for myself. practical support LIVING WITH CANCER 25 I came out of that and I just felt like the Creator has plans for me. I'm still here. I'm great with that. ~ Georgina Hunt, Tlatlasikwala and K wakiutl territoriesAnd I'm grateful to have First Nations input, First Nation words and sharing because I'm not sure where to go from here. I'm grateful to hear a First Nations perspective because that's closer to home than the non-Native ways. My friend came to do some holistic healing with me three times before the mastectomy surgery, and three times after for follow up healing. 26 LIVING WITH C ANCER Advocacy WHAT IS AN ADVOCATE? An advocate is someone you choose to speak up for you. There may be moments along your cancer journey where you may need to use the strength of another person to be your voice, support you in decision making, or advocate for your needs. An advocate may be a family member, Elder, trusted friend or professional. You can also be your own advocate. An advocate doesn't make decisions for you but helps ensure your needs are heard and respected. They don't have to be an expert, only willing to help get the information you need, ask questions, and support your decisions. You can have more than one advocate. She helped me find the resources that I needed and she helped me put things into place. A lot of things went wrong that required somebody to help me think. She stayed with me, she never left me. ~ Patricia Prince, Health Care Pro vider and cancer survivor My c ousin was my advocate. She went on the entir e journey with me. She didn't leave my side. She lear ned along the way. LIVING WITH CANCER 27 It's important to have somebody there to speak on behalf of people who are unable to speak for themselves, to help communicate in the most effective way. When something is such a traumatic experience, it doesn't have to be awful. Advocacy supports people in a better way, to speak in a way with practitioners and people with power, to be able to feel comfortable with what's happening to them. And they have a right to be taken care of, to be heard and to know what's going on within their diagnosis.It's scary to go into something where you're putting your trust into a group of people and a system you don't know. ~ Amanda Engen, Dene Tha, Chetah A lberta and M\u00e9tis advocacy 28 LIVING WITH C ANCER I WENT THROUGH the cancer journey with my mom. She never spoke up for herself so when I found out I had breast cancer, I took everything that I witnessed and went through with my mom and used it to the best of my knowledge to do what would be best for me. I w ent to my doctor because I knew something was wr ong. I felt a lump and I went to the doctor and he kind of blew me off. Just because your mom died of breast cancer doesn't mean you're going to get it. And he gave me that look so I just left. advocacy I think a week went by and my husband made me go, because it was getting painful. We asked if we could be referred to Vancouver for the biopsy test. We did and I went through hours and hours of testing and biopsy. When you're told that you have cancer, it's like you're going to die. That's what I thought. I was trying to process it in my own mind. What am I going to do? What's he going to do? What are the kids going to do? 29 So we went through everything. We decided we were going to meet the surgeon. I had a double mastectomy and reconstruction. It was a really, really hard struggle going through chemo. I was sick, sick, sick. I was trying to process it in my own mind. What am I going to do? What's he going to do?It was a struggle, but you know today I'm one year cancer free. ~ Janet Harry , Haisla Nation30 LIVING WITH C ANCER you may want to ask yourself about advocacy and support Do I need an advocate? Who is the best advocate for me? Who makes me feel better and gives me strength? Who in my life can navigate the medical system with me and advocate on my behalf? Your notesQUESTIONS LIVING WITH CANCER 31 I'M SO GLAD I can tell the people, this is the journey that I went through. Awareness, education, prevention and scr eening. That's what is needed. Cancer care everywhere in this whole world, that's what is needed. ~ Dell a Gladue, Gitxsan Nation 32 LIVING WITH C ANCERUnderstanding cancer We know that cancer is more than just a disease, it happens to a person. It affects more than our physical selves. Being diagnosed with cancer is an event that may impact all aspects of our lives - from our relationships to our mental, spiritual, emotional and physical wellbeing. Cancer is a disease that can start anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells. Normally, human cells grow and divide to form new cells and keep our bodies healthy and whole. However, occasionally things go wrong for a variety of reasons. Cells start to grow and reproduce into an unorganized mass or tumour and may start to invade surrounding healthy tissues. Tumours - or lumps - are classified as either benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer). A benign tumour is one that does not spread or invade nearby tissues, and does not usually cause life-threatening health issues. A malignant tumour is one that can grow quickly and affect nearby tissues, and can also spread to other parts of the body, interfering with the proper functioning of an organ or body system. understanding c ancer LIVING WITH CANCER 33I REMEMBER there was a time that it felt like my body was so drained. And I had to make a choice right there. To either let m yself go or to be a warrior and fight. I kept thinking about my family, my mom and dad, my wife and everybody who loves me, and especially my granddaughter. And I said, 'I'm a warrior, I'm going to fight, I'm going to fight until the end.' And right there and then, I survived and now I'm cancer free. Because I'm a warrior. I fought it. And if it comes back again, I'm not going to give up. And I don't want any of you guys to ever give up on me. ~ Larry Tiljoe, Wet'suwet'en understanding c ancer 3334 LIVING WITH C ANCER you may want to ask yourself if you are a caregiver Do I have anyone I can talk to about my feelings? Is there a support group for caregivers in my area? Does my cancer centre have emotional support for caregivers? What do I need for my own personal wellness? Will I know when I need to ask for help to support my own wellness? Who will I reach out to for help when I need physical and emotional support? Where can I learn more about being a caregiver? for being a caregiver and supporting someone diagnosed with cancer Remember that being an advocate requires permission and an invitation. Discuss the treatment desires and health care needs of the person diagnosed with cancer. Help the person diagnosed with cancer understand or gain access to medical, traditional or other supports they need. Discuss the practical needs of the person diagnosed with cancer, such as providing daily care, maintaining the home, or providing child care.QUESTIONS TIPS LIVING WITH CANCER 35 Supporting a loved one on the path Being a caregiver is often defined as someone who provides physical and emotional support to a cancer patient, but does not get paid to do so. Caregivers can provide help with daily care, such as feeding, bathing, house cleaning, making meals, giving medicines and discussing feelings. It's a big job! A caregiver may be a spouse, family member or close friend. Acting as a caregiver can enhance the physical and emotional wellbeing of the person going through cancer, but can also challenge the caregiver's own wellness. Being a caregiver can be very rewarding, as well as overwhelming and stressful. It's important that when providing emotional and physical supports that a caregiver also takes the time to focus on their own personal wellness. supporting a loved one You need to talk about it if you can. And if your friend has cancer, you just say to them, 'I'm here, whatever you need. I'm here.' Don't say, 'You should do this.' We need to say, 'If you need me, I'm here to do what ever I can to help you. ~ Joan Jacobs36 LIVING WITH C ANCER Your notes Many Ways of Healing MANY WAYS OF HEALING LIVING WITH CANCER 39 MANY WAYS OF HEALING For myself, I was trying to find that balance between western and traditional, that was what was going on with me. It was something I was already practicing before. I put my faith in both and it all came down to my faith. I didn't rank one against the other. I didn't do that. It was really important for me to put my faith out there. And I had such a huge team without me even asking for it. It's like when I was in the hospital, somebody sent a traditional healer there for me and he did some work on me. He did some chanting and after it was all done, the nurse who came in and did my vitals says she found that every time there was traditional work, the vitals were really good. She was open to it. We need more medical staff to be open to our tr aditional values. ~ Gail Gus, Tseshaht First Nation 3940 LIVING WITH C ANCER Many Ways of Healing Every person with cancer deserves to know what is happening to them, to understand their options, and to have their questions heard. Even if our questions fall outside of the medical system's view of health, we must be able to respectfully discuss our healing and wellness needs and choices with our medical team. Historically, all cultures hold traditional wellness and healing knowledge and practices. Many of these traditional wellness and healing practices are still in use. The Western medical ways to treat cancer can be complemented with other traditional and holistic practices that address the disease while respecting a person's overall wellbeing. Medical terminology can be confusing to cancer patients. Similarly, the beliefs and practices of Indigenous traditional healing and wellness can be unfamiliar to health care providers. A conversation can help bridge these two streams of medicines in order for doctors and patients to learn from each other. Traditional wellness is a term that encompasses traditional medicines, practices, approaches and knowledge. Traditional wellness is based on a holistic model of health, and can include drumming, singing and ceremony. Wellness is about the whole person and striving for the best life while living with cancer.Medical terminology can be confusing to cancer patients. Similarly, the beliefs and practices of Indigenous traditional healing and wellness can be unfamiliar to health care providers. many ways of healing LIVING WITH CANCER 41 zI started connecting with some of our Elder women back here in my home community, which is the Little Shuswap Band. And just talking to them and joining them in learning how to smudge, learning how to sweat. I started canoeing, worked at our pow wow. I dove into our Shuswap culture and started taking language lessons. Living better. And of course praying every day, relying on Elders quite a bit. The spiritual advice. ~ Dawn Francois, Secwepemc Nation many ways of healing42 LIVING WITH C ANCER THAT WAS THE BEST thing I ever did. And my support worker helped me and before I went for my surgery, my best friend, an Elder, took me out to a very isolated area. She smudged me down with juniper. As a Southern Carrier person we use juniper. She sweeped me all and then I went into surgery. I had my surgery and they told me I had to walk. So just like nothing, because of the smu dging, I was able to walk because smudging was so po werful. ~ Ellie Peters, Lhtako Dene Nation (Red Bluff Band) many ways of healing 42 LIVING WITH CANCER 43 many ways of healingComplementary medicine refers to healing that we can do in addition to treatments received by the health care system. Complementary medicine can include massage, naturopathy, acupuncture, meditation, yoga, and First Nations and M\u00e9tis traditional wellness. Traditional wellness and healing Traditional medicines balance the use of indigenous plants and foods with philosophy and ceremonies. Each Nation has their own teachings and practices when it comes to healing and wellness. Some of these traditions are incorporated into mainstream society while many remain unique to specific communities. Some people may want to bring traditional healing and wellness into their cancer journey. Those who add a path of traditional healing can reach out to cultural teachers and informed community members. It's up to you to decide what you need. Be sure your choices are safe and informed. Consult with your doctor before ingesting any plant medicines and participating in traditional healing practices, as some may cause dangerous side effects.Medicine for the whole person many ways of healing It's up to you to decide what you need. Be sure your choices ar e safe and informed. 44 LIVING WITH C ANCER Talking to your medical team can help you understand which traditional healing practices and medicines may or may not be compatible with your medical treatment or present state of wellbeing. It's important to communicate your choices to your medical team to keep you safe.Wellbeing and healing Healing is about treating the whole person and striving for the best quality of life while living with cancer. Traditional foods and healing can be used as part of a holistic approach to healing alongside Western approaches. Food and culture also sustain our wellbeing. Consuming traditional foods and cultural practices may support spiritual and nutritional needs. Traditional wellness encompasses traditional practices, approaches, medicines and knowledge. Reflecting a holistic model of health is often overlooked in the treatment of disease. many ways of healing LIVING WITH CANCER 45 many ways of healingWHEN WE START to define what culture is, it can be a slippery slope. My cul ture is who I am. It's my soul, it's the way I walk in the w orld. It is my everyday life. That's what makes me a cultural being even if it doesn't look the way it might look written in a text. Whether it's smudging, drumming, going to the water for a spirit bath, just being a good human being makes us stronger individuals. ~ Amanda Engen, Dene Tha, Chetah A lberta and M\u00e9tis 46 LIVING WITH C ANCER you may want to ask yourself about traditional wellness and healing Am I interested in tradition al wellness and healing? Do I know how to access t raditional wellness and healing? Do I understand how tradi tional wellness and healing may or may not interact with the treatment I am receiving at the cancer center? (Note: Its important to discuss with your healthcare provider how traditional wellness and healing may interfere with your treatment) If I am interested in traditi onal wellness and healing, am I comfortable discussing it with my health care provider? If I am interested in traditi onal wellness and healing, and I am not comfortable discussing it with my health care providers, do I know someone who can help me?QUESTIONS Your notes LIVING WITH CANCER 47 for talking to your health care provider about traditional wellness and healing Ask for extra time at y our next appointment with your health care provider to be able to discuss traditional wellness and healing. Gather as much informati on as possible about the traditional wellness and healing practices you are interested in. Bring a close friend or an Elder/healer with you to support you in your discussion with your health care provider. Be prepared that the healt h care professional may not have knowledge about or believe in traditional wellness and healing practices and medicines. W rite down or record your conversation with your health care provider about the use of traditional wellness and healing throughout your cancer journey.TIPS Your notes48 LIVING WITH C ANCER I hear al l the time that people don't know how to t ell their doctors. I have patients who tell me they won't tell their doctor. They say, 'They'll just tell me to quit.' Well you don't have to, you can still choose to do whatever you want, right? I say, 'That's your decision. I just want to make sure that you're safe.' There's no danger in talking about it. ~ Dana Marshall, Aboriginal Patient Navigator If I am interested in traditional wellness and healing, and I am not comfortable discussing it with my health care providers, do I know someone who can help me? I believe that the earth is true medicine for everyone. ~ Reverend Lily Bell, Haida Nation many ways of healing LIVING WITH CANCER 49 many ways of healingMy role as a First Nations surgeon is to share where my expertise is, but I am not an expert in traditional medicine. I am so fortunate to learn from my patients about traditional healing practices. My job is to do the best I can, and absolutely respect each patient's perspective. I can respect an individual's beliefs, even if it is different from what I have been trained in. ~ Dr. Nadine Caron, Surgeon (Prince George, BC) Sagamok First Nation ( Anishnawbe) Living wisely with good health is something w e have always done, and we are often reaching back into our ancestral knowledge - our traditional ways of being and knowing - to reaffirm how we can live healthier lives today and tomorrow. ~ Dr. Evan Adams, First Nations Health Authority, Sliammon First Nation 50 LIVING WITH C ANCER First Nations Perspective on Health and Wellness THE CENTRE CIRCLE represents individual human beings. Wellness starts with individuals taking responsibility for our own health and wellness. THE SECOND CIRCLE illustrates the importance of Mental, Emotional, Spiritual and Physical facets of a healthy, well, and balanced life. It is critically important that there is balance between these aspects of wellness and that they are all nurtured together to create a holistic level of wellbeing in which all four areas are strong and healthy. THE THIRD CIRCLE represents the overarching values that support and uphold wellness: Respect, Wisdom, Responsibility, and Relationships. All other values are in some way essential to the four below: RESPECT is about honouring where we come from: our cultures, traditions, and ourselves. Respect is intergenerational. It is passed on through our communities and families. It is the driving force of the community because it impacts all of our life experiences including our relationships, health, and work. It is defined as consideration and appreciation for others, but there is also recognition that respect is so much more in Indigenous communities: it entails a much higher standard of care, consideration, appreciation and honour and is fundamental to the health and wellbeing of our people. There is an intuitive aspect to respect, because it involves knowing how to be with oneself and with others. WISDOM includes knowledge of language, traditions, culture, and medicine. Like respect, wisdom is an understanding that is passed on by our ancestors from generation to generation and has existed since time immemorial. It is sacred in nature and difficult to define. RESPONSIBILITY is something we all have: to ourselves, our families, our communities, and the land. Responsibility extends not just to those with whom we come into contact or relate - but also to the roles we play within our families, our work, and our experiences in the world. Also entailing mutual accountability and reciprocity, responsibility intersects with many areas of our lives, and involves maintaining a healthy, balanced life as well as showing leadership through modelling wellness and healthy behaviours. RELATIONSHIPS sustain us. Relationships and responsibility go hand in hand. Like responsibility, relationships involve mutual accountability and reciprocity. Relationships are about togetherness, team-building, capacity building, nurturing, sharing, strength, and love. Relationships must be maintained both within oneself and with those around us. LIVING WITH CANCER 51 THE FOURTH CIRCLE depicts the people that surround us and the places from which we come: Nations, Family, Community, and Land are all critical components of our healthy experience as human beings. LAND is what sustains us physically, emotionally, spiritually and mentally. We use the land for hunting, fishing, and gathering. The land is where we come from and is our identity. It is more than just the earth. It includes the ocean, air, food, medicines, and all of nature. We have a responsibility to care for the land and to share knowledge of the land with our people. Land and health are closely intertwined because land is the ultimate nurturer of people. It provides not only physical but emotional and spiritual sustenance, because it inspires and provides beauty; it nurtures our souls. COMMUNITY represents the people where we live, where we come from, and where we work. There are many different communities: communities of place, knowledge, interests, experiences, and values. These all have a role in our health. FAMIL Y is our support base, and is where we come from. There are many different kinds of families that surround us, including our immediate and extended families. For Indigenous people, family is often seen as much broader than many Western perspectives. Our immediate and extended families are often interchangeable, so Western descriptions and definitions don't always apply. Our families may also include who we care for, support systems, and traditional systems in addition to (or instead of) simply blood lines. It is important to recognize the diversity that exists across British Columbia, that there are different family systems that exist (e.g. matrilineal). NATIONS include the broader communities outside of our immediate and extended families and communities. In essence, Nation is an inclusive term representing the various Nations that comprise your world.THE FIFTH CIRCLE depicts the Social, Cultural, Economic and Environmental determinants of our health and wellbeing. SOCIAL determinants such as security, housing, food, prevention, promotion, education, health awareness, and outreach supports, are all critical aspects of our health and wellbeing. ENVIRONMENTAL determinants include the land, air, water, food, housing, and other resources that need to be cared for and considered in order to sustain healthy children, families and communities. Safety and emergency preparedness are critical components. CULTURAL determinants include language, spirituality, ceremonies, traditional foods and medicines, teachings, and a sense of belonging. ECONOMIC determinants include resources which we have a responsibility to manage, share, and sustain for future generations. There is a need to create balance in how we use our resources and a need for good leadership to help us create this balance. The people who make up the Outer Circle represent the vision of strong children, families, elders, and people in communities. The people are holding hands to demonstrate togetherness, respect and relationships, which in the words of a respected BC elder can be stated as \"one heart, one mind.\" Children are included in the drawing because they are the heart of our communities and they connect us to who we are and to our health. The colors of the sunset were chosen specifically to reflect the whole spectrum of sunlight, as well as to depict the sun's rotation around the earth which governs the cycles of life in Indigenous communities.52 LIVING WITH C ANCER Your notes CHOOSING TREATMENT PATHSChoosing Treatment Paths LIVING WITH CANCER 55 CHOOSING TREATMENT PATHS When deciding your treatment path, it's important that you feel comfortable with what is being recommended for you. Understanding why certain treatments are being recommended, what to expect from them, and what the outcomes might be will help you make an informed decision. Your health care team may recommend surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy or any combination of these to treat your cancer. The next few pages will discuss the different types of treatments and questions you may wish to consider. Remember, it is your right to ask as many questions about treatment as you need to feel comfortable making a decision. They said, 'You really know your body.' I said, 'Yep, I was r aised with my grandmother, and I listened to her.' ~ Dor a Laurent, Nazko First Nation 5556 LIVING WITH C ANCERTypes of medical treatment and cancer drugs The type of treatment that is required for each person's type of cancer is unique and will be determined by many factors. The three main types of cancer treatment are surgery, chemotherapy and radiation; however, there are other forms of cancer treatment that may be prescribed to you. SURGERY Surgery can be used for many reasons including diagnosing and treating cancer. For example, it can be used to remove a tumour (lump) or reduce the size of a tumour. Aftercare and recovery following surgery depends on a number of factors, including the type of surgery and the type of treatments you may be receiving. Surgery can be overwhelming but asking questions and learning about your surgery will help in understanding what's happening.CHEMOTHERAPY Chemotherapy uses special medicines or drugs to treat cancer. These special medicines may be given as pills, through special injections or intravenously (IV) into the body. The drugs are carried by the blood to each cell of the body to reach cancer cells wherever they are. The frequency and length of your chemotherapy treatment will be unique for your cancer. Chemotherapy is often given every day, every week or every month at regular intervals. There are many types of cancer drugs and combinations of cancer drugs used to treat cancer. This can be confusing. It's important that you know that you can ask any questions you may have about your treatment plan. RADIATION THERAPY Your cancer may be treated using radiation, which uses high-energy rays to kill or shrink tumours (lumps). It does so by destroying or slowing down the production of cells. Radiation therapy can be used in treatment on its own or in combination with cancer drugs. Radiation can also be used to assist in shrinking a tumour before surgery. choosing tr eatment paths LIVING WITH CANCER 57 I asked my doctor, 'What are my options?' He told me some people go for the operation or chemo. My family encouraged me to fight it. My mom said, 'Don't you give up!' So I went back to see my family doctor and told him I want to have the cancer removed. He began to make arrangements for the operation. ~ William Samson, T simshian, Lax Kw'alaams At that time he wanted to know more. He suggested I go for the biopsy in Prince George which verified I had prostate cancer. My family doctor confirmed I had prostate cancer and then we talked about the options again. Only this time it was for real. He asked me what I wanted to do and I said that I wanted to fight the cancer. I left the doctors office feeling angry that it was confirmed. I spoke to my family of what I had to deal with. It was an emotional time for everyone. 58 LIVING WITH C ANCER for working with your health care providers Bring y our support person or advocate with you.

It took over my ener gy, everything. LIVING WITH CANCER 61 I told the doctors, I know my body. They both went out and they got the nurse to take the needle off my spine because that's where they were giving me the painkillers. And then after that, I said, 'I'm not taking them anymore. I may be in pain but I can live with pain because I've had five kids. I know the pain.' And then after when they t ook out that needle, I was able to get up off the bed . And I told them,'See, that's all you had to do.' And they were really surprised. They said, 'You really know your body.'

This can help reduce fatigue and allow y ou to take care of yourself more easily. Keep your employer up-to-date on your schedule or other work-related changes. Getting help at home can mean more energy for work. Explore the idea of sharing daily chores amongst friends and family members who have offered to help. Where possible, adapt your work schedule to accommodate y our treatment plan. This may look like extra days off, working par t-time, working from home, or changing your office or desk location to be closer to the bathroom.TIPSPOST TREATMENT Post Treatment LIVING WITH CANCER 67POST TREATMENT The path to recovery When active treatment is over, people are discharged from the BC Cancer Agency. Many people require recovery time and follow up care. This process may take time and also involve travel to and from treatment centres. This part of the journey can uncover mixed emotions. Taking care of your wellbeing is important during this time. Many cancer centres have counsellors available as a resource. You may feel a little confused or lost on what to do next. Loved ones, work colleagues and managers or community members may expect you to return to pre-diagnosis routines. However, this may not be possible right away. RETURNING TO WORK When returning to work, some people find talking to a counsellor can help with developing a return-to-work plan, finding healthy ways to cope, learning relaxation exercises, supporting time management or understanding feelings of depression or anxiety. The best support is being present, just being there. ~ Janet Harry & Trevor Amos, Haisla Nation 6768 LIVING WITH C ANCERMy cancer is in remission. It 's been 5 years and nothing has come back. At first it felt like when they told me to leave, that I was fine. It left me in a turmoil because I was getting such good care and all of a sudden, I had to take care of myself. All my medical support group was gone and I had to take care of myself. It was something I had to work through which I did with the support of my family. C ancer has definitely made me more aware of the pr eciousness of life. It's changed my attitude toward people, made me humble because I know that I'm not in control. And who's in control is God. And that's one way I got through it. I completely gave my cancer to God because I wasn't in control. ~ Adeline Sarver, M\u00e9tis LIVING WITH CANCER 69 The doctor said it will never be cured but it 's at bay. I STILL HAVE the cancer, it won't go away. I took the treatment. It was intravenous. It was like a chemo but I never lost my hair. It was only four treatments, seven hours at a time. Four weeks, four treatments, one treatment a week for four consecutive weeks. It's been four years now. Basically I'm in limbo. ~ Lou Romailler, M\u00e9tis the path to recovery 6970 LIVING WITH C ANCER you may want to ask your health care provider about post treatment Will information about my treatment be sent to my family doctor or nurse practitioner in my home community? Can I receive a copy of my treatment? For example, the list of surgeries, name of cancer drugs or hormone therapy, information surrounding radiation treatment, etc. Who can help me find a family doctor or nurse practitioner if I don't already have one? Who do I speak to if I have questions regarding my health or side effects? Will I need to undergo regular check-ups? How often and where? When can I expect to return to my normal routines and habits after treatment has ended? How can I expect to physically feel after treatment has ended? How might I feel mentally after treatment has ended? What if I need help at home or help in returning to work? Should I wait to go back to work? for returning to work post treatment If it feels helpful, explore d rawing on a counsellor for support. Discuss with y our health care team about a time-frame for returning to work. K eep your employer informed about your progress and your plan for going back to work. Make sure you and your employer have realistic expectations about what you can do when you return to back to work. Ease back slowly . If possible, try some practice days with light duties, reduced hours and frequent breaks to make sure that you are both physically and emotionally ready to return to workTIPSQUESTIONS LIVING WITH CANCER 71 you may have for your health care provider about follow-up care Are there long-term effect s from my treatment? Are there signs and sympt oms if my cancer comes back? Can I lessen the chances t hat my cancer will come back? Who should I ask if I ha ve concerns about my health?

Will my follow-up test resu lts be shared with my family doctor or nurse practitioner? for wellness post treatment Be gentle with y ourself. Your physical body, mind and emotions may take time to catch up and feel whole. Continue to share y our experiences and emotions with your advocates and support people. Remember that e ven when you have completed treatment, your emotional supports can still be part of the journey. Consider whether y ou want to include traditional wellness as part of your wellness path post treatment.TIPSQUESTIONS72 LIVING WITH C ANCERTo soothe my soul and spirit, I sought out places that were Aboriginal in nature where I could find other Aboriginal people, and who I could pray with and drum with. Drumming for me was healing was so important and helped me feel grounded and happy, and I felt comfortable about being around other people who were Aboriginal. ~ Patricia Prince, Health Care Provider and cancer survivor the path to recoveryI GO SEE a doctor every 15 months and not too long ago, I had chemo, radiation and internal radiation treatments. The meditation practices were so important. I had to learn how to do prayer and meditate while I was going through everything. Learning how to meditate got me through. I had to learn how to relax and stay in the moment because if I was taken out of the present, then I was into the future and then I was in a place of anxiety and worry, and that's not where I want to be. LIVING WITH CANCER 73 The path of advanced cancer and palliative care Sometimes, despite the best efforts of your medical team, cancer advances to the point that it is unlikely to be cured. This can be referred to as \"advanced cancer\" or \"terminal cancer\" and may lead to palliative care. Palliative care focuses on providing good quality of life to ensure you are as comfortable and pain free as possible. Palliative care may involve medicines, treatments, physical care, psychological/social services and spiritual support for you, your family and others who are helping to care for you Receiving a diagnosis of advanced or terminal cancer can be difficult. You may experience a wide range of emotions upon finding out. You are not alone and your care team is there to support you. You may want to discuss the physical symptoms of advanced cancer with your health care provider. You may also want to ask your care team if there are any professional supports available to you while you process this news. Many decisions accompany the news of advance cancer. You may want to discuss your end of life plans with your friends and family, such as how you want to be remembered through a celebration of life, funeral or a cultural event. There are also several legal documents, or advanced directives, that you and your family may wish to discuss. palliative care 74 LIVING WITH C ANCERTHE BEST SUPPORT is being present, just being there. Physically be there to hold each other when we need to be held. To let each other vent when we need to vent and not taking it personally. To be family support for one another whether it's happy, frustration, anger, whatever. It's said and then it's done.With my mom it was a tough one. We've had so much cancer in our family. Support is hard to keep up. We try to be not so glum and the positivity was a tough thing to keep but we did our best. My mom, she was a very quiet, very introverted person. I talked to her almost daily. I'm getting emotional thinking about it. I tried not to talk about the cancer as much as I could but in the end, we needed to acknowledge the feelings. It was a tough thing to ackno wledge her pain but we had to, to help her out. W e had to cry with her. I was taught not to show emotions, so to do that with my mom and my sister was hard for me. palliative care LIVING WITH CANCER 75And that helped a lot. It helped us a lot. Before my mom was on her last few months there, she really opened up and she told me her story when she went to residential school. She never shared that with anybody else. She shared it with me before she died and that was so tough to hear. She was abused, she was badly abused in the school. For her to say that was a huge, huge step for her. It was healing for her. So I think she passed on kno wing that she was okay. ~ Trevor Amos, Haisla Nation 76 LIVING WITH C ANCER and legal matters to consider Adv ance Directives provide instruction about your wishes for medical care if you are unable to communicate or make decisions yourself. Representation Agreemen ts allow you to appoint a Temporary Substitute Decision-Maker to make certain decisions on your behalf related either to your personal care or health care treatment, or your financial affairs. Wills are legal instruction about how you wish your estate to be handled when you pass. Enduring P ower of Attorney is a person or persons that you give the legal authority to act on your behalf if you can no longer do so.DOCUMENTS Your notes LIVING WITH CANCER 77 Your notes you may have for your health care provider about palliative care F or people who have the same cancer I have, how long do they usually live?
