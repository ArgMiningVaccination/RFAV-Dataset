NSU began in 1964 in downtown Fort Lauderdale, on East Las Olas Boulevard, but it was not until 1967 that we were able to raise the necessary funds to build our first building on what is now our main campus and matriculate 17 Ph.D. students. That one building has developed into our 314-acre campus in Davie- Fort Lauderdale. Today, we have nearly 27,000 students and more than 5 million square feet of classroom space, libraries, laboratories, and recreation areas. Our programs are offered throughout Florida and the United States, as well as in 12 countries. We have more than 152,000 alumni, and our graduates reside in all 50 states and in more than 63 countries. The university continues to experience a sustained period of academic growth, due in large part to its exploration of alternative strategies in educating professionals and its commitment to excellence in academics, research, clinical training, community service, and well-rounded opportunities for all students. Collaboration at all levels with diverse partners is the essence of NSU. The entire NSU community is focused on achieving our Vision 2020 without compromising our core values. I welcome you to explore this catalog and communicate with our admissions offices to best address your future goals, dreams, and ambitions. We are dedicated to providing service and academic excellence to you as you continue toward the progressive realization of your worthy goal\u2014success.

Nova Southeastern University Mission Statement The mission of Nova Southeastern University, a private, not-for-profit institution, is to offer a diverse array of innovative academic programs that complement on-campus educational opportunities and resources with accessible, distance- learning programs to foster academic excellence, intellectual inquiry, leadership, research, and commitment to community through engagement of students and faculty members in a dynamic, lifelong learning environment. Core Values Academic Excellence Student CenteredIntegrityInnovationOpportunityScholarship/ResearchDiversityCommunity The Vision 2020 Statement, Mission Statement, and Core Values were adopted by the NSU Board of Trustees on March 28, 2011.6 NSU Health Professions DivisionHealth Professions Division Mission Statement The mission of the Nova Southeastern University Health Professions Division is to train health practitioners in a multidisciplinary setting, with an emphasis on medically underserved areas. The institutional premise is that health professionals should be trained in a multidisciplinary setting and, whenever possible, with integrated education. The university trains students in concert with other health profession students so that the various disciplines will learn to work together as a team for the good of the public's health. During their didactic work, students share campus facilities and, in some cases, have combined classes. In their clinical experiences, they work together in facilities affiliated with the university. The division aims to educate health care practitioners who will eventually increase the availability of health care to alleviate health care shortages. The division aims to mitigate some of these shortages by exposing the entire student body to the needs and challenges of rural, underserved, and geriatric populations. Existing curricula require all students to attend ambulatory care rotations in rural or urban areas, or both, making Nova Southeastern University oriented toward a pattern of training its students in areas geographically removed from the health center itself, and to the care of indigent and multicultural population groups. In doing this, it developed training programs that address the health care needs of the region's most medically underserved populations. All students are encouraged to participate in community service. The Health Professions Division supports the mentoring and collaboration of interdisciplinary research with faculty members.Health Professions Division Board of Governors Royal Flagg Jonas, J.D.

Labor Day, university closed NSU Health Professions Division 9University History Sustained growth and unity has made Nova Southeastern University (NSU) the largest independent university in the state of Florida. This growth culminated in January 1994, when Nova University and Southeastern University of the Health Sciences merged to become Nova Southeastern University. Nova University was chartered in 1964 as a graduate institution in the physical and social sciences. Over time, Nova added programs in law, education, business, psychology, computer science, oceanography, social and systemic studies, and hospitality, and, in 1972, introduced its first off-campus course of study, in education. Soon, Nova became nationally recognized for its innovative distance learning programs. Today, field-based programs are located in 32 other Florida cities, in nearly 30 other states, and at selected international sites. While Nova continued to expand its educational reach, Southeastern University of the Health Sciences also was on an expansion course. Southeastern was created by osteopathic physicians committed to establishing a College of Osteopathic Medicine in the Southeast. As a result, Southeastern College of Osteopathic Medicine, as it was first known, opened in 1981. From 1987 to 1997, Southeastern added Colleges of Pharmacy, Optometry, Allied Health, Medical Sciences, and the College of Dental Medicine, which admitted 88 students in 1997. This growth was unprecedented, but not unsurpassed. There was still more to come. The merger brought on new possibilities. Prior to 1994, Nova had evolved with innovative technology and Southeastern expanded to provide much needed health care education. With the merger, Nova Southeastern University's resources make possible a more transdisciplinary education. Students have an opportunity to integrate across the disciplines and understand how their professions relate to society as a whole. The growth of the Health Professions Division (HPD) is continuous. In 2003, an R.N. to B.S.N. (Bachelor of Science in Nursing) program was added to the College of Allied Health, which then became the College of Allied Health and Nursing. Numerous other nursing programs were added over the next nine years. This resulted in the creation of a separate College of Nursing in 2012. At the same time, the College of Allied Health was renamed the College of Health Care Sciences. Campus Nova Southeastern University's Health Professions Division\u2014now composed of the Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine, Pharmacy, Optometry, Health Care Sciences, Medical Sciences, Dental Medicine, and Nursing\u2014offers a rare blend of tropical South Florida weather, plentiful sunny beaches, an easily accessible campus, a dedicated and professional faculty, well established affiliations with many hospitals, clinics, and health care systems in the area, and a mission to educate professionals capable of providing the highest-quality health care service. The university's main campus is located on a lush, 314-acre site in the Greater Fort Lauderdale area, 10 miles inland of the Atlantic Ocean and readily accessible via several highways and Florida's Turnpike. The Health Professions Division complex, dedicated in June 1996, is located on the northwest corner of the main campus and encompasses more than 540,000 square feet of space for administrative offices, classrooms, laboratories, the HPD Library, and a patient-services clinic. There is also a 600,000-square-foot parking structure with space for 2,000 vehicles. The division elicited input from students and faculty members and incorporated innovations in architecture, ergonomics, and computer-aided technology to provide facilities that enhance the learning experience. The complex is an arrangement of eight buildings, four of which are connected by air conditioned lobbies. The Sanford L. Ziff Health Care Center, physical plant, and parking garage are connected to the central buildings by covered walkways. Administration and faculty offices are on the upper levels of the five-story Terry Administration Building, with the departments of admissions and student affairs, and a cafeteria located on the first floor. Located in the lobby of the Terry Building, the Health Museum exhibits artifacts and antiques representing each of the colleges of the Health Professions Division. The collection houses an informative and historical display of medical memorabilia for students, faculty members, and visitors to explore. Private tours of the museum can be arranged with the curator, Cynthia Magalian Tupler, B.F .A. Contact Helen Caidin in the Pharmacy Department to schedule an appointment, (954) 262-1380. Adjacent to the administration building is the Assembly Building, which consists of a 500-seat auditorium, a 250-seat auditorium, and eight 126-seat amphitheater- classrooms, all equipped with computerized audio/ video systems. Connected to this is the three-story Library/ Laboratory Building. On the first floor is the library and a 100-seat cardiac laboratory utilizing \"Harvey,\" a computerized mannequin that duplicates the sounds and symptoms of most heart conditions. Also on the first floor are patient simulation training rooms and a 50-station computer laboratory for student use. The second and third floors house laboratories, a student lounge, and a research area. Laboratories are equipped 10 NSU Health Professions Divisionfor viewing pretaped medical procedures, and each large laboratory has a video system and hookups to equipment such as an electron microscope, so that illustrations can be amplified for laboratory-wide viewing. Just north of the Library/Laboratory Building is the Health Care Center, with facilities for primary health care, rehabilitative services, eye care, pharmacy, and a simulation nursing laboratory. The College of Dental Medicine's 70,500-square-foot building advances the state-of-the-art in dental education facilities. The first floor contains a 100-operatory predoctoral clinic facility and clinics and support laboratories for oral medicine, radiology, and oral surgery. The second floor houses a faculty practice and clinics for postgraduate programs in endodontics, orthodontics, periodontology, and prosthodontics, a 120-position simulation technique laboratory and support laboratories. Faculty and administration offices are on the third floor. The Health Professions Division added a building to foster opportunities for interdisciplinary education and to meet the need for additional classroom, computer, and research facilities. This modern, spacious facility known as the Assembly II Building contains more than 31,000 square feet of instructional and research facilities, including a 312-seat auditorium, ultrasound training center, a 50-station computer science laboratory, and 37 seminar and study rooms.

Admissions Policy Students provisionally are admitted to a degree-seeking program based on a review of unofficial transcripts or other specific program admission requirements. However, this admission includes a condition that final and official transcripts, documents, and requirements must be received within 90 calendar days from matriculation for the graduate and professional programs and by the end of the drop/ add period for undergraduate programs. If these final and official transcripts, documents, and/or requirements are not received by that time, the student will not be allowed to continue class attendance. Financial aid will not be disbursed to a provisional/ conditional student until he or she has been fully admitted as a regular student (all admissions requirements have been approved by the college /program admissions office). Students who have an unpaid balance 30 days from the start of the term will be assessed a $100 fee. Background Checks Accepted applicants and students are required to authorize the NSU Health Professions Division to obtain background check (s) as per the polic y adopted on March 2011. If the background check (s) reveal information of concern, which the NSU Health Professions Division may deem unfavorable, HPD will request that the individual provide a detailed written explanation of the information contained in this report, along with appropriate documentation (e.g., police reports). Students may also be required to authorize clinical training facilities that they are assigned to by the Health Professions Division to obtain a background check with the results reported to the clinical training facility. This information must be delivered in the format requested (electronic or written) to the NSU Health Professions Division Background Check Committee within 10 business days of the date the communication is sent or another date specified by HPD in its communication with the student. Offers of admission will not be considered final until the completion of the background check (s), with results deemed favorable by the NSU Health Professions Division, and where appropriate, by the clinical training facilities. If information received indicates that the student has provided false or misleading statements, has omitted required information, or in any way is unable to meet the requirements for completion of the program, then the admission may be denied or rescinded, the student may be disciplined or dismissed, or his or her enrollment may be terminated. NSU Health Professions Division 11Following the initial background check (s), students will be asked annually to provide a certification relating to any convictions or guilty or no-contest pleas to any criminal offense other than traffic violations. Tuition Credit Policy\u2014Voluntary Withdrawals Students who wish to withdraw must submit a written request for voluntary withdrawal to the dean, who will evaluate the student's request. After completing the required withdrawal form(s) and obtaining the dean's approval, an eligible student may receive partial credit of the tuition, according to the following formula: Drops during the first week of the semester in which classes begin ........ 75 percent Drops after the first week of the semester in which classes begin ......... No refund The withdrawal period starts in the second week of the semester and ends three weeks prior to the end of the semester. Students enrolled in the master's degree programs in the College of Osteopathic Medicine (M.S. in Biomedical Informatics, M.P .H., and/or M.S. in Disaster and Emergency Preparedness) will have until 11:59 p.m. the first Sunday of the semester, which is the end of the drop/add period, to make any changes in their schedule without incurring any financial expenses. Students who drop after this date will not be entitled to receive a refund. Students enrolled in bachelor's degree programs are required to follow policy procedures for drops and withdrawals as noted in the undergraduate catalog. Students may not be given refunds for portions of tuition paid by financial aid funds. As appropriate, the respective financial aid programs will be credited in accordance with federal regulations. Students should notify the Office of Student Financial Assistance prior to withdrawing to determine the effect this will have on financial aid. For complete withdrawals, please refer to the Return of Title IV Funds section of the student handbook. Failure to comply with these requirements could jeopardize future receipt of Title IV student assistance funds at any institution of higher education the student may attend. If a student is due a refund, it will be mailed to the student's address or deposited directly into his or her checking account as soon as the dean of the respective college has approved the withdrawal and the drop request has been processed. The tuition refund policy is subject to change at the discretion of the university's board of trustees/the NSU administration. Changes to a semester's registration will not be accepted 30 days after the semester ends.Florida Residency Eligible students must request in-state tuition on application. For tuition purposes, students' Florida residency status (in-state or out-of-state) will be determined at initial matriculation and will remain the same throughout the entire enrollment of the student at NSU. Accordingly, tuition will not be adjusted as a result of any change in residency status after initial enrollment registration.

Standards of Progress A student receiving veterans education benefits must maintain satisfactory academic progress (SAP). Standards for SAP are published at www.nova.edu/sap. A student who, at the end of the SAP evaluation period, has not met satisfactory academic progress may file an appeal based on extenuating circumstances. With an approved appeal, a veteran student may be certified veteran education benefits on a probationary basis. If the student does not meet satisfactory academic progress by the end of the probationary period (one evaluation period), the student's veterans education benefits will be terminated. For VA payment of benefits purposes, an I (Incomplete) designation for a course must be converted to a credit grade counting toward graduation, or a failing grade, by the end of one calendar year, unless permission for a delay is granted by the academic program office and/or dean for that program. Grade/Progress Reports for Students Receiving Veterans Benefits Nova Southeastern University furnishes each student with a Notification of Posting of Grade with instructions on how to view an unofficial transcript that shows current status of grades and earned semester hours for all courses completed and/or attempted, as well as grades for courses in which the student is currently enrolled. At the end of every evaluation period (e.g., term, semester) each veteran can request an official transcript that shows the current status of grades and earned semester hours for all courses completed and/or attempted. This transcript can be obtained from the One-Stop Shop at the William and Norma Horvitz Administration Building or Terry Administration Building or online at https://sharklink.nova.edu/cp/home/displaylogin. Conduct Policy for Students Receiving Veterans Benefits All VA students are expected to comply with the legal and ethical standards of Nova Southeastern University. Academic dishonesty and/or nonacademic misconduct will result in disciplinary action. Specific instances of misconduct include, but are not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, knowingly furnishing false information to the institution, and forging or altering institution documents and/or academic credentials. The institution reserves the right to require a student to withdraw at any time for misconduct as described above. It also reserves the right to impose probation or suspension on a student whose conduct is determined to be unsatisfactory. Students who feel their rights have been denied are entitled to due process. Students should refer to the Appeals and Grievance Procedures listed in the NSU Student Handbook. 14 NSU Health Professions DivisionThe Office of the University Bursar The Office of the University Bursar is responsible for billing students, collecting and depositing payments, issuing refunds from excess financial aid funds, and verifying students' eligibility for financial aid funds. Bursar's Office Policies By registering for courses at Nova Southeastern University, the student accepts financial responsibility for payment of all institutional costs (including, but not limited to, tuition and fees) when those charges become due. Payment is due in full at the time of registration. NSU ebills are sent in the middle of each month. However, to avoid late charges, students should not wait for their billing statement to pay their tuition and fees. A student will not be able to register for future semesters until all outstanding balances from previous semesters have been paid in full. If a student has a balance 30 days after the start of the semester, a hold and a $100 late fee will be placed on his or her account. This hold stops all student services, including, but not limited to, access to the University RecPlex, academic credentials, and future registrations. It will remain on the student's account until the balance has been paid in full. Delinquent student account balances may be reported to a credit bureau and referred to collection agencies or litigated. Delinquent students will be liable for any costs associated with the collection of unpaid charges, including attorney fees and court costs. All registration agreements shall be construed in accordance with Florida law, and any lawsuit to collect unpaid fees may be brought in the appropriate court sitting in Broward County, Florida, regardless of the student's domicile. Methods of Payment NSU accepts Visa, MasterCard, and American Express. Check payments include traveler's checks, cashier's checks, personal checks, and money orders. International checks must be in U.S. funds only and drawn on a U.S. bank. Wire transfers are accepted. Electronic check and credit card payments can also be made through NSU eBill. Credit card authorization forms can be downloaded from the Bursar's Web site at www.nova.edu/bursar/forms/cc_authorization.pdf and faxed to (954) 262-2473. Payment Plans Some graduate program offices offer payment plan options. Please check your program's Web site for details. In addition, NSU offers the following plans: 3-Month and 10-Month Payment Plans NSU students (with the exception of international students) who wish to defer payment of their tuition, fees, and other institutional charges due at the time of registration may sign up for a 3-month or a 10-month payment plan. The 10-Month Payment Plan is available for the combined fall and winter semesters. For details, visit www.nova.edu/bursar/payment/payment_plans.html. Employer Tuition Assistance Plans Undergraduate students participating in employer tuition assistance programs who wish to defer tuition payment need to submit a letter of eligibility, a purchase order from their employer, or details of the program from the employer's human resources office or the company Web site. They must also provide postdated payments (checks or credit card authorizations) for the amount of tuition. Payment of tuition only (not fees), may then be deferred for five weeks after course completion. A $75 deferment fee is charged for this service and must be paid at registration, along with all other fees. Students must notify the Office of Student Financial Assistance if they are participating in the Employer Tuition Assistance Plan. Graduate students should inquire with their program office regarding any employer tuition assistance deferment plans. Florida Prepaid College Plan NSU accepts and bills the Florida Prepaid College Plan for tuition, fees, and on-campus housing costs. The plans are based on the tuition rates of the tax-assisted Florida public colleges and universities. The difference between NSU tuition, fees, and on-campus housing costs and the allocations through the Florida Prepaid College Plan is the sole responsibility of the student. If a student is on the unrestricted plan, the student must designate a dollar amount for up to the cost of tuition and fees. Students new to NSU must contact Florida Prepaid at 800-552-GRAD (4723) to authorize NSU for payment. Additionally, each semester, the student must submit a copy of the front and back of the ID card with a signed statement indicating the number of credits or the amount to be invoiced.

NSU Health Professions Division 21Core Performance Standards for Admission and Progress The Nova Southeastern University Health Professions Division is pledged to the admission and matriculation of qualified students and wishes to acknowledge awareness of laws that prohibit discrimination against anyone on the basis of race, color, religion or creed, sex, pregnancy status, national or ethnic origin, nondisqualifying disability, age, ancestry, marital status, sexual orientation, unfavorable discharge from the military, veteran status, or political beliefs or affiliations. Regarding those students with verifiable disabilities, the university will not discriminate against such individuals who are otherwise qualified, but will expect applicants and students to meet certain minimal technical standards (core performance standards) as set forth herein with or without reasonable accommodation. In adopting these standards, the university believes it must keep in mind the ultimate safety of the patients whom its graduates will eventually serve. The standards reflect what the university believes are reasonable expectations required of health professions students and personnel in performing common functions. The holders of health care degrees must have the knowledge and skills to function in a broad variety of clinical situations and to render a wide spectrum of patient care. In order to carry out the activities described below, candidates for Health Professions Division degrees must be able to integrate consistently, quickly, and accurately all information received, and they must have the ability to learn, integrate, analyze, and synthesize data. Candidates for degrees offered by the Health Professions Division must have, with or without reasonable accommodation, multiple abilities and skills including intellectual, conceptual, integrative, and quantitative abilities; interpersonal communication; mobility and strength; motor skills; and hearing, visual, tactile, behavioral, and social attributes. Candidates for admission and progression must be able to perform these abilities and skills in a reasonably independent manner. Intellectual, Conceptual, Integrative, and Qualitative Abilities These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis, and synthesis. Problem solving\u2014a critical skill\u2014requires all of these intellectual abilities. Candidates and students must have critical thinking ability sufficient for good clinical judgment. This is necessary to identify cause-effect relationships in clinical situations and to develop plans of care. In addition, candidates and students should be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures. An individual is expected to be able to perform multiple tasks in a diverse, dynamic, highly competitive, and challenging learning environment. All individuals are expected to meet their program requirements on a satisfactory level as determined by HPD administration or the applicable college/program administration. Osteopathic medical students must be able to perform multiple tasks in a diverse, dynamic, highly competitive, and challenging environment. They must be able to think quickly and accurately in an organized manner, despite environmental distractions. Interpersonal Communication Candidates and students must be able to interact with and observe patients in order to elicit information; perform examinations; describe changes in mood, activity, and posture; and perceive nonverbal communications.

An Osteopathic Physician T wo types of complete physicians may practice medicine in all 50 states: the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) and the Doctor of Medicine (M.D.). While both types of physicians are trained in all aspects of patient care, D.O.s offer a distinct, holistic approach to medicine. Osteopathic medicine is distinguished by an emphasis on primary care, by using osteopathic manipulative medicine when necessary, and by a tradition of caring for patients in underserved rural and urban areas. Osteopathic physicians recognize the relationship between physical structure and organic function and view the human body as an interdependent unit rather than an assortment of separate parts and systems. While all medical and surgical specialties are represented within the osteopathic medical profession, the training of vitally needed family physicians and the drive to reach rural, minority, geriatric, and indigent populations, make the osteopathic medical profession unique. We are proud of our success in producing vitally needed primary care physicians\u2014nearly 70 percent of our graduates practice in the primary care disciplines of family medicine, general internal medicine, or general pediatrics\u2014and we remain committed to training physicians capable of delivering the highest standards of total-patient care in all practice settings.Accreditation Nova Southeastern University College of Osteopathic Medicine has been granted accreditation by the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation of the American Osteopathic Association. This body is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education and the Council of Post-Secondary Accreditation as the accrediting agency for colleges educating osteopathic physicians and surgeons.

Course of Study The College of Osteopathic Medicine has a dedicated faculty; well established affiliations with medical centers, hospitals, and health care systems; a nationally recognized rural medicine program; and a mission to educate the finest osteopathic physicians possible. We place our students and residents at the nation's fourth largest public hospital system\u2014the North Broward Hospital District\u2014or at one of our regional academic centers throughout the state to improve continuity and coordination of clinical education within our vast and growing clinical training network. Our innovative curriculum is designed to fulfill our mission of training primary-care physicians. The design of the curriculum is based on successful academic models\u2014 carefully developed and integrated. It emphasizes interdisciplinary collaboration, guiding students to develop a holistic, and more importantly, an osteopathic approach to medicine. We continually correlate basic scientific information with fundamental clinical application. Students are exposed to clinical settings in their first semester, which gives them the opportunity to prepare for the \"real world\" of medicine. This clinical exposure continues into the second year when students have increased opportunity to interact with standardized patients on campus as well as be involved, under physician supervision, with real patients in the office and hospital setting. College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014Osteopathic Medicine Program 29A notable aspect of the clinical program is a required three- month rotation in a rural practice setting. In rural clinics throughout the state of Florida, our students provide health care to medically underserved and indigent patients. Our students learn to treat various patients whose lifestyles, practices, and attitudes toward health care differ from those seen in more traditional training sites. This enriching educational experience is one that cannot be taught in the classroom.Physicians do not work in a vacuum, but rather in a health care team, and NSU promotes interdisciplinary cooperation whenever possible. Students share faculty members and campus facilities with NSU's pharmacy, dental, optometry, physician assistant, physical therapy, occupational therapy, public health, nursing, and medical science students.

Special Programs The Interdisciplinary Generalist Curriculum (IGC) Program The IGC Program exposes medical students to primary care clinical settings from the beginning of their first year, with the long-term goal of increasing the numbers of graduates who will pursue careers in family medicine, general internal medicine, and general pediatrics. The premise of the program is that exposure to professional role models is a significant determinant of medical students' career choices, and that an early clinical experience is an essential learning component for medical students to begin to correlate classroom knowledge with actual patient encounters. The IGC Program is composed of three components: (1) the IGC Physician Mentor Program, (2) the IGC Business of Medicine /Managed Care Program, and (3) the College of Osteopathic Medicine in Community Service (COM2Serve) Program. IGC Physician Mentor Program Students are placed with physician mentors, either one or two students at a time. They may elect to switch mentors every semester and are required to switch primary care disciplines and mentors after their first year. In addition to providing a broad exposure to the role of a primary care physician, the physician mentor provides the student with the opportunity to perform patient histories and physical examinations within the limits of the student's ability, and educates the student by providing timely feedback and engaging in discussions and explanations of his or her decision making. There are approximately 140 primary care physician mentors who teach first- and/ or second-year medical students in their private offices. This network of preceptors is composed of physicians in the three primary care disciplines; they are located throughout the tricounty area.IGC Business of Medicine/Managed Care Program Students learn the business aspects of practice as well as the various components of managed care organizations (MCOs). Each student is either assigned to an MCO teaching partner, or attends a special conference or seminar on health care systems, policies, and access. Students learn how a managed care organization operates by participating in seminars and small group discussions led by professionals representing various departments/experiences such as medical operations, physician committee meetings, utilization management, quality management, and provider /practice management. IGC COM2Serve Program This is the community service component of the IGC preceptorship, in which second-year medical students are involved in service learning with community health centers, public health departments, homeless assistance centers, migrant farmworker clinics, and other subsidized community clinics. The COM2Serve partner organizations provide health care and other needed services to medically underserved, minority, and at-risk populations. Osteopathic Principles and Practice Laboratories The development of the palpatory skills used for diagnosis and treatment is a significant distinction between the educational programs in osteopathic and allopathic medical schools. Stedman's Medical Dictionary defines palpation as \"examination with the hands and fingers; touching, feeling, or perceiving by the sense of touch.\" Palpation in the osteopathic medical education context is the use of touch to examine the body. Palpatory skills are used in all areas of osteopathic medical practice and are especially important in the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of the musculoskeletal system. The development of palpatory skills is taught in the first- and second-year osteopathic principles and practice (OPP) courses. Successful completion of these courses requires active participation in all laboratory sessions. During the two years, each student will palpate, in the laboratory setting, a variety of people, representing both genders and individuals with different body types to simulate the diversity of patients expected in a practice setting. Being palpated by other students helps the student understand from the patient's perspective how palpation feels and enables the students to provide feedback to their laboratory partners, thus enhancing the palpatory skills of all students. The osteopathic medical profession uses a variety of treatment models, and through the skills development process, the student learns the art and skills of manipulative treatment. Psychomotor skills are developed by repeated practice. Reading and observation, although helpful, do not develop the skills required to perform palpatory diagnosis and manipulative treatment. Each student is required to actively participate in all skills development laboratory 46 College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014Osteopathic Medicine Programsessions. These skills are taught by treating and being treated by a cadre of students of both genders and with varying body types to simulate a medical practice setting. Area Health Education Center (AHEC) Program The mission of NSU's Area Health Education Center (AHEC) Program is to improve the access to and the quality of primary health care service to medically underserved communities by linking the resources of academic health centers with community-based health care providers. Nova Southeastern University's College of Osteopathic Medicine, the first medical school in the state of Florida to develop an AHEC Program, officially began its program in 1985. Since its inception, the program has worked to develop effective and comprehensive training programs that improve access to quality primary health care for Florida's medically underserved rural and inner- city urban communities. Our nationally recognized program now serves underserved communities and populations throughout a nearly 20,000 square mile area of South and Central Florida. Our first AHEC center\u2014the Everglades AHEC\u2014reaches underserved areas within a 10-county region extending from the inner city of northern Miami-Dade County to rural communities around Lake Okeechobee. Based on the success of the Everglades AHEC, the university was awarded additional funding to develop a Central Florida AHEC, which now serves nine counties and extends from Lake Okeechobee to north of Orlando. By including training programs in community settings, we expose students to the challenges, rewards, and practice opportunities related to working in medically underserved areas. Students have opportunities to work together while learning to provide valuable primary care services to the community. Consortium for Excellence in Medical Education (CEME) In January 1999, the College of Osteopathic Medicine established an innovative program to revolutionize clinical education and training. The Consortium for Excellence in Medical Education (CEME), in affiliation with NSU College of Osteopathic Medicine, was formed to increase opportunities for postdoctoral medical training, including internships, residencies, fellowships, and continuing education programs. The CEME is an alliance of affiliated clinical sites linked through electronic networks; teaching, research, and community health collaborations; and a shared commitment to excellence in the education of tomorrow's physicians. CEME partners are joining forces on postgraduate clinical education, research initiatives, and public health and preventative medicine programs to benefit Florida's elderly, indigent, and minority patient populations. The CEME creates a unified medical education system composed of Nova Southeastern University College of Osteopathic Medicine and 18 teaching hospitals and hospital systems spanning the state of Florida and includes ambulatory centers, county health departments, and social service agencies. Four additional affiliated programs are located in Georgia, Louisiana, and North Carolina. The CEME, as a dynamic network of affiliated regional academic training centers, uses distance learning systems to strengthen teaching, research, and community health collaboration while also nurturing a shared commitment to excellence in the education of tomorrow's physicians. West Palm Beach Veterans Affairs Medical Center The College of Osteopathic Medicine has a major affiliation with the W est Palm Beach V eterans Affairs Medical Center (V AMC). This state-of-the-art health care facility's close academic ties with the college includes sharing academic positions, granting faculty appointments to V AMC s taff m embers, a s hared r esidency t raining program in preventive medicine, and major participation in the clinical program of the college. The V AMC employs a computerized paperless patient record system. It also permits X rays to be visualized with high resolution, includes laboratory and other reports that can be retrieved and tracked, has systems that ensure the selection of appropriate drugs for patient safety, and facilitates arrangements for specialist consultations. Students may spend as much as six months at the facility during their clinical years. Rural Medicine Program Since its establishment in 1979, the College of Osteopathic Medicine has been committed to educating students about rural medicine and having them train in underserved communities. The Department of Rural Medicine's instructional programs have been recognized nationally for helping to meet the health care needs of underserved communities and enhancing the medical skills of our students. Our fourth-year medical students train for three months in rural and underserved settings. They are expected to expand their diagnostic and therapeutic skills as well as their patient and community proficiency in relation to addressing multicultural populations. Training sites include community health centers, private physicians' offices, ambulatory care facilities operated by the West Palm Beach Veterans Affairs Medical Center , and leading health care institutions of the Florida Department of Corrections. The Rural Medicine Training Program provides our students with a unique and enriching experience. A number of our graduates are now clinical directors at the community health centers or have established successful practices in a rural Florida region. College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014Osteopathic Medicine Program 47Preventive Medicine Prevention, in its broadest sense, is practiced by all physicians and other health professionals who help their patients to stay healthy. Preventive medicine, however, is also a distinct medical specialty, one of 25 recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties. The specialty of preventive medicine is based on our knowledge that promoting health and preventing disease requires work with both individuals and communities. Preventive medicine physicians are trained in both clinical medicine and public health. They have the skills to understand and reduce the risks of disease, disability, and premature death both in individuals and population groups. The distinctive aspects of preventive medicine include knowledge and competence in biostatistics bioterrorism epidemiology environmental and occupational health planning, administration, and evaluation of health services the social and behavioral aspects of health and disease the practice of prevention in clinical medicine The American Osteopathic Association grants certificates to physicians who have successfully completed three years of supervised training and a written examination in any one of three areas: general preventive medicine /public health, occupational medicine, or aerospace medicine. Specialists in general preventive medicine /public health focus their skills on population groups, such as the residents of a particular community or state or the patient population of a health center, hospital, or managed care organization. Preventive medicine specialists work in a wide variety of settings, including primary care and managed care settings, public health and community agencies, industry, and academia. These physicians usually engage in multiple activities, including planning, administration and evaluation of disease prevention and health promotion programs, research, teaching, and direct patient care. The varied career paths include managed care, public health, occupational medicine, aerospace medicine, clinical medicine, informatics, policy development, academic medicine, international medicine, and research, covering all levels of government, educational institutions, organized medical care programs in industry, as well as voluntary health agencies and health professional organizations. About 6,000 physicians nationally are board-certified in preventive medicine. In addition to the need for more physicians trained in the specialty of preventive medicine, there is a need for more training in prevention in all the other medical specialties, especially in primary care. Toward this end, the Department of Preventive Medicine is initiating efforts to strengthen prevention education, particularly in relation to individual patient care. This will be accomplished by weaving the distinctive aspects of preventive medicine throughout all coursework offered to medical students at the College of Osteopathic Medicine. Specialists in preventive medicine, who have skills in population-based prevention as well as individual preventive interventions, can assist the other specialties in the further development of education in prevention and the population-based health sciences for residents and medical students alike. Geriatric Teaching Program The College of Osteopathic Medicine has a strong commitment to teaching students, residents, and physicians about the care of the geriatric patient. As a result, the college requires a didactic geriatric course in the M-2 year, which addresses \"successful aging.\" Attention is given to elderly populations and their diverse profiles and circumstances. During the M-3 year, students participate in a monthlong, required geriatric clerkship, where they care for elders in a variety of settings under the supervision of a geriatric specialist. The College of Osteopathic Medicine also provides clinical teaching in geriatrics for second-year family medicine residents from its Palmetto Family Medicine Residency during a one-month rotation. The College of Osteopathic Medicine, along with the North Broward Hospital District, sponsors a geriatric fellowship training program for family medicine physicians who successfully complete an American College of Osteopathic Family Physicians (ACOFP) approved family medicine residency program. This will prepare the physician for a Certificate of Added Qualifications (CAQ) in geriatrics. We are excited about what we are doing in geriatrics and are looking for ways to expand our programs and teaching facilities.

Additional information about the program, including details about the curriculum, may be obtained by contacting the associate dean of education, planning, and research, NSU College of Osteopathic Medicine, 3200 South University Drive, Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33328-2018. D.O./D.M.D. Dual-Degree Program In order to address the access to care issue and meet the needs of underserved populations, Nova Southeastern University's (NSU's) College of Dental Medicine and College of Osteopathic Medicine have structured a curriculum that provides students with an opportunity to receive a D.O. (Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine) and a D.M.D. (Doctor of Dental Medicine) degree. This D.O./D.M.D. Dual-Degree Program is in accord with the missions of both schools. This dual program will prepare health care practitioners to use a totally holistic approach to health care that will address preventive medicine and general dentistry, as well as access to care issues, meeting the needs of rural and underserved populations. Once students complete this six-year program, they will be qualified for licensure in dentistry and for postgraduate, one-year residencies that are required prior to medical licensure. Only a select number of motivated students who have attained the highest academic standards and embody the spirit of this collaborative initiative will be considered. College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014 Public Health Program 49Master of Public Health Program The Master of Public Health (M.P .H.) Program is an accredited graduate level program designed to prepare students to define, critically assess, and resolve public health problems. The program provides training in the theories, concepts, and principles of public health and their application. To meet the rapidly changing needs of health service professionals, including preventive medicine specialists, the curriculum is structured to accommodate a diversity of backgrounds and individual career goals. There is a need for public health professionals to address emerging and re-emerging diseases, environmental health concerns, health care reform, health care system, sociopolitical factors affecting our nation's health, and expansion of health issues that are global in scope.

(0-60-0) College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014 Biomedical Informatics Program 59At a population level, public health informatics aims to apply information technology advances to traditional public health research and practice. Detection, management, and prevention of disease across populations\u2014through the collection and analysis of vital statistics and health data\u2014have the potential to be significantly influenced and advanced through the auspices of evolving information technology. People who have a degree in biomedical informatics have a wide variety of career opportunities. The type of informatics career options that an individual can pursue is, to some extent, dependent on his or her background and selected area of study. Biomedical informatics trained professionals may become chief medical information officers (CMIOs) chief medical officers (CMOs) chief information officers (CIOs) directors of medical informatics chief nursing information officers (CNIOs) project managers implementation specialists project designers researchers programmers clinical systems analysts health information technology (HIT) educators and trainers HIT consultants template writers nursing informatics specialists account representatives The following are examples of settings in which they might work: hospitals and health systems community health centers physician practices and clinics health care agencies within the federal and state government health information technology system vendors eHealth companies health insurance companies pharmaceutical companiesBiomedical Informatics Program Nova Southeastern University College of Osteopathic Medicine's Biomedical Informatics Program is designed to train future leaders in the development, dissemination, and evaluation of health information technologies that are utilized by hospitals and health systems, health information technology system vendors, eHealth companies, insurers, pharmaceutical companies, and academic institutions. With its focus on clinical informatics, the program's curriculum emphasizes the areas of computer science and its clinical applications, management, and evaluation of information technology in the health care environment. The Biomedical Informatics Program offers coursework in both on-campus and online formats to enable working professionals to earn a master's degree or graduate certificates in health informatics without career disruption. Biomedical informatics is an interdisciplinary field encompassing computer and information sciences, cognitive and decision-making sciences, medicine and epidemiology, telecommunications, business management, education sciences, and a collaboration of a number of other fields. In short, biomedical informatics is the intersection of health care, technology, and people, with the implicit goals of improving the quality and safety of the world's health care systems while reducing cost. As terminology continues to evolve along with the field itself, the more broadly encompassing term \"biomedical informatics\" can generally be broken down into three more distinct levels: bioinformatics, medical informatics, and public health informatics. At the molecular level, incorporating things such as gene sequencing research and pharmaceutical development, bioinformatics looks to change the way biological data is stored, retrieved, organized, and analyzed, ultimately producing new tools/metho ds for generating valuable biological knowledge. Medical informatics , at an individual patient level, can further be divided into a number of more specific areas including nursing informatics, imaging informatics, pharmacy informatics, dental informatics, and consumer health informatics. Medical informatics aims to manage an individual's health data\u2014including storage, retrieval, sharing, and optimal use\u2014with the goals of providing safer, more efficient, and more affordable health care. Integration of advanced clinical information systems into the health care decision-making process allows health care professionals to accomplish tasks in a more competent and effective manner. Furthermore, this integration affords development of novel tasks. It produces new knowledge and allows providers to begin thinking like epidemiologists in addition to providing patient care.60 College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014 Biomedical Informatics ProgramAt the end of the course of study leading to the degree of Master of Science in Biomedical Informatics, the graduate will be able to 1. identify the fundamentals of a telecommunication network design 2. develop practical health care applications using popular database management systems 3. evaluate information technology for integration into health care 4. utilize the knowledge, skills, and concepts of health information technology in evidence-based practice 5. apply principles of information security and policy formation 6. assess existing and emerging health informa- tion technologies 7. appraise health information exchange system standards 8. analyze project management strategies in health information technology Admissions Requirements The Biomedical Informatics Program evaluates the overall quality of its applicants, looking at academic achievement, personal motivation, knowledge of health care, life experience, and recommendations.

(3 credits)68 College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014 Disaster and Emergency Preparedness ProgramMaster of Science in Disaster and Emergency Preparedness Program Program Overview The Master of Science degree in Disaster and Emergency Preparedness (M.S. DEP) is part of the Institute for Disaster and Emergency Preparedness in the College of Osteopathic Medicine. The program will provide students with the knowledge, skills, and basic research capabilities to enter one of the fastest-growing new academic disciplines with both a national and an international perspective. This interprofessional degree is designed to provide students with the theoretical knowledge and applied skills to be part of the rapidly growing, interdisciplinary field of emergency management and preparedness. It will allow students from a variety of disciplines to specialize in one of several tracks (all of which have a community research practicum at the local, regional, state, federal, or international level as a key component). The program is available online and will incorporate interactive and individual, asynchronous activities. In addition, all students in the program will be required to participate in a cohort orientation at the beginning of the program and a final presentation at the conclusion of their studies. The tracks for the Master of Science degree include maritime safety and security, cyber security, criminal justice, public health, and environmental hazards. . Distinct tracks will allow the students to apply the principles of emergency preparedness to these areas of particular interest and need. The M.S. in Disaster and Emergency Preparedness is designed to provide students with theoretical knowledge and applied skills, along with basic research application in the field that will help them acquire the competencies as outlined by the FEMA Emergency Management Higher Education Program. This will give them the knowledge and skills necessary to work in an all-hazards preparedness environment. Disaster preparedness is a critical challenge and responsibility of government, businesses, educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and health care agencies and institutions. Response to disasters begins long before the disaster occurs, involving pre-disaster planning, mid-disaster operations, and post-disaster recovery and reconstruction. A successful response can only be carried out through the coordinated efforts of all levels of government, the public and private sector stakeholders, and nongovernmental organizations, as well as the involvement of faith-based organizations. The program will help meet the need for trained emergency preparedness professionals at local, state, national, and international levels. The Master of Science in Disaster and Emergency Preparedness not only develops the skills in leadership, but facilitates students in gaining specialized training in emergency preparedness and disaster response related to: 1) maritime safety and security, 2) cyber security , 3) criminal justice, 4) public health, and/ or 5) environmental hazards. With the increased threat of terrorism, law enforcement and public health personnel need additional training in the areas of response and recovery. As the threats of cyber-theft, cyber-crime, cyber- fraud, and cyber-warfare continue to increase, computer and IT professionals need additional training in protecting our nation's assets and infrastructure. In addition, as the incidents of piracy on the high seas continue to grow and the potential for terrorists to attack our ports becomes more imminent, maritime security has become a high priority. As natural hazards continue to increase, environmental and meteorological experts are being called upon more and more for their input related to these disasters. This new degree program fits the mission of NSU in that it provides an \"accessible distance learning\" program while \"fostering intellectual inquiry, leadership, and commitment to community through engagement of students\" by providing an online curriculum that is convenient, but also offers ample student and faculty member engagement. The program fosters community involvement by requiring a community research capstone project. The curriculum also supports the mission of the College of Osteopathic Medicine for \"producing compassionate and ethical lifelong learners and advocating for the health and welfare of diverse patient populations\" through its specialty track in public health, while the overarching goal of the degree to prepare communities to be more prepared and resilient to disasters serves the overall general health and welfare of all. Program Objectives By creating a cadre of individuals who interact with the public and private sectors, the program in disaster and emergency preparedness can help to create an environment in which all-hazards initiatives include preparedness, mitigation, rapid response, and recovery as the standard. Students who graduate from this program will achieve the following program objectives: provide leadership skills to individuals entering the field of emergency preparedness and disaster response demonstrate leadership skills in planning for and responding to disaster and emergency situations (both natural and man made) identify , describe, and respond to the types of threats and risks associated with natural and man-made disasters demonstrate the skills to conduct a comprehensive vulnerability risk assessment at the community, county, state, and national levels demonstrate knowledge and skills of available tools and resources for disaster and emergency planning and response College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014 Disaster and Emergency Preparedness Program 69 analyze the disaster process and differentiate disaster response actions, including recovery operations, from routine emergency operations exhibit competencies for disaster mitigation, response, and recovery at the individual, community, and state levels demonstrate the knowledge and skills necessary to build resilience post-disaster in a variety of disaster settings enter the field of emergency management and be leaders within this discipline Course of Study The M.S. DEP program consists of five core courses (15 credit hours), including a required community research practicum (3 credit hours). Along with the core requirements, the student can choose one of several specialization tracks or elect to pursue a general track. These tracks require four core courses (12 credit hours) in the chosen discipline. To complete the degree, an additional 6 credit hours will be taken from general electives or electives in one of the five areas of specializations (i.e., tracks) that include maritime safety and security, cyber security, criminal justice, public health, and environmental hazards. Students also have the option of choosing from the electives list for the Master of Science in National Security Affairs, a partner degree program offered by the Graduate School of Humanities and Social Sciences, part of the Division of Applied Interdisciplinary Studies. In order to analyze the broad spectrum of hazardous events and to appropriately assess and employ the large volume and rapidly evolving literature in this field, all students are required to take biostatistics and an introductory course in all-hazards preparedness, as well as the practicum in their chosen specialization track. In addition to the three courses required for all students, each student must take a core of 3 credit hours from the Management and Leadership cluster and 3 credit hours from the Threats, Hazards, and Impacts cluster. Realizing that disaster and emergency preparedness often crosses the boundaries of interests, as well as the professional lines of homeland security and other disciplines, students in the program will be able to take related programs at NSU, such as conflict resolution, sociology, or psychology , as a substitute for up to 6 elective credit hours (with permission of the adviser).

The pharmacist's role has expanded rapidly from drug compounding and distribution to a more patient-oriented role. The College of Pharmacy is educating its students in practices vital to meeting the challenges facing the profession and important to improving health and reducing health care costs. The College of Pharmacy admitted its first class in 1987 to become the first College of Pharmacy in South Florida. Since then, it has graduated more than 3,000 pharmacy professionals. The college offers the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) degree program and began offering a graduate Ph.D. program in 2010. Pharmacists are experts on drugs and therapeutic goals, their biological action and uses, formulation, adverse effects, and potential for drug interactions. Pharmacists must be able to think quickly and accurately in an organized manner, despite environmental distractions; be able to communicate effectively; and have interpersonal abilities sufficient to interact with others. They consider both the medication and the patient to ensure the patient has the right drug, in the right amount, for the right length of time, and with minimal adverse effects. The result is improved health care. Most pharmacists practice in patient-oriented settings: in community pharmacies, hospitals, extended care facilities, or public health clinics. In addition, pharmacists are College of Pharmacy Lisa Deziel, B.S., Pharm.D., Ph.D. Dean84 College of Pharmacyemployed by the pharmaceutical industry in research and development, in manufacturing, or as medical service representatives. They work in academic institutions, government, health maintenance organizations, and home health care programs. It is because of these challenges and opportunities that pharmacy has assumed a wider role and become an increasingly rewarding profession involving patient counseling, compliance, and education. Accreditation The Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education, 135 S. LaSalle Street, Suite 4100, Chicago, IL 60603, (312) 664-3575, 800-533-3606; Fax (312) 664-4652, Web site: www.acpe-accredit.org , has accredited the Doctor of Pharmacy Program of the College of Pharmacy, Nova Southeastern University. The College of Pharmacy is a member of the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy. Facilities The College of Pharmacy is headquartered on the third floor of the Health Professions Division Administration Building. Pharmacy practice and research laboratories are located on the third floor of the Library /Laboratories Building, near the Health Professions Division' s research laboratories. Experiential sites are primarily located throughout Central and South Florida. In the fall of 2000, the NSU College of Pharmacy opened a West Palm Beach program. After spending many years in a shared site, NSU was happy to move to its own four- story, 75,000-square-foot facility. Classes began at the new location in the fall of 2011. The Palm Beach Student Educational Center features 26 classrooms, including four labs. It also includes a student lounge, a fitness area, a pharmacy library, and offices. In the fall of 2001, a full-time program on the campus of Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Puerto Rico in Ponce, Puerto Rico, was opened. The Puerto Rico program is anticipating a move to San Juan in the summer of 2014, with classes beginning in the fall at the new location. Each location has administrators and faculty and staff members. Interactive video technology is used to provide lectures among the three sites simultaneously. This provides for live interaction between lecturer and students regardless of location. Identical handouts, tests, and texts are used. Communication through telephone, fax, online technologies, and email are available to students at all sites. All students have access to the Health Professions Division Library, computer labs, online learning resources, and the vast technological innovations provided by NSU, which has been a leader in distance education programs for many years. The pharmaceutical care center and pharmacy are adjacent to the health clinic in Fort Lauderdale. This is a community pharmacy with disease management services for diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, and anticoagulation. It also manages pharmacy services, including drug regimen review, consultation, and teaching. As part of its innovative approach to research, education, and service, Nova Southeastern University College of Pharmacy has created the first Center for Consumer Health Informatics Research (CCHIR) in the country. The mission of the CCHIR is to generate discoveries that leverage the potential of consumer health informatics to improve patient health. This will be realized through the foci of consumer health informatics, medicines information, and public health. Financial Aid The purpose of the Student Financial Assistance Program at Nova Southeastern University is to help as many qualified students as possible to complete their pharmacy education. Various loans, scholarships, and grants are available to qualified students to help ease the high cost of a health professions education. Approximately 90 percent of College of Pharmacy students receive some form of financial assistance. These financial assistance programs are described in a variety of separate university publications. Although most first-year pharmacy students will be classified as graduate students for financial aid purposes, students who matriculate with fewer than 90 semester hours and students in the dual-admission program will be classified as undergraduates for the first year in the College of Pharmacy. Transfer Credits Requests for transfer credit must be submitted in writing to the executive associate dean. The request must include a copy of the transcript (containing the course title and final grade) and a course syllabus. Transfer credit will only be considered for courses taken at pharmacy schools accredited by ACPE or for those courses given prior approval by the executive associate dean. An official transcript from the institution attended must be provided before transfer credit will be awarded. All transfer credit requests must be received prior to August 1 of the first year of pharmacy school. The dean's office will evaluate the courses and determine appropriate credits.

The internship must be completed within the guidelines of the Florida Board of Pharmacy as set forth in the Rule, Chapter 64B16-26.400(4), or by the Board of Pharmacy in the state in which the student plans to fulfill the requirements for internship. A Social Security number is necessary in order to obtain an intern license from the state of Florida. All efforts should be made by the student to obtain a Social Security number prior to matriculation. It is the responsibility of any student who does not have U.S. citizenship or permanent resident status to ensure that his or her visa status allows for the issue of a Social Security number. An intern license is a requirement for placement on practice experiences. Without practice experiences, a student cannot complete the curriculum or the requirements of the Pharm.D. degree program. Any student who has concerns regarding visa or Social Security status should contact the Office of International Students and Scholars by phone at (954) 262-7240 or 800-541-6682, extension 27240, or by email at intl@nsu.nova.edu. The directors of experiential education will provide assistance and guidance to students regarding pharmacy practice experiences/earning required intern hours. Course of Study The Doctor of Pharmacy degree is awarded after successful completion of four years of professional study in the College of Pharmacy. The curriculum stresses innovative teaching delivery and assessment methods. Students are provided an initial orientation during which they are exposed to library and online resources, professionalism, and academic expectations. The curriculum is designed so courses integrate information and build on one another in order to provide students with the knowledge and skills necessary to be successful in the profession. The didactic component of the curriculum builds a foundation in the medical and pharmaceutical sciences. Traditional courses in physiology and pathophysiology, biochemistry, microbiology, research design, and statistics are provided in order to develop a solid foundation. Pharmaceutical sciences courses including Pharmaceutics, Pharmacokinetics, and Nonprescription Therapies are designed to provide students with a strong understanding of the principles of drug therapy. The innovative curriculum also includes the integration of medicinal chemistry and pharmacology into one course titled Pharmacodynamics, which runs five semesters. Insight into the business, human relations, communication, marketing, and legal aspects of pharmacy and the health care system are also provided. Students are actively involved in the two-semester Introduction to Professionalism and Leadership course that covers topics such as ethics and professionalism and promotes student advocacy in the profession and the community. Additionally, the curriculum includes courses that focus on application of material learned in previous semesters. Pharmacotherapy addresses the use of drugs in the disease process and physical assessment provides students with hands-on opportunities to develop skills essential to monitoring and managing medication therapy. Students hone their analytical skills with courses in pharmacoeconomics and outcomes research and biomedical literature evaluation. All students must complete a minimum of 6 semester hours of elective credit. Unique aspects of the curriculum include an introductory pharmacy practice experience program and an integrated laboratory. Opportunities for the students to experience pharmacy practice first hand are provided early in the curriculum. In the first year, students participate in the Introduction to Professionalism and Leadership course, which is designed to begin the development of abilities including thinking and learning; social and cultural awareness; active citizenship and leadership; personal, ethical, and legal judgment; and communication. In the second year of the curriculum, students spend four hours per week in a community pharmacy setting. Practice experiences in the third year involve eight hours per week in hospital and pharmacy service preclinical settings. Patient Care Management Lab is initiated during the second year and continues through the third. This provides an opportunity for students to integrate information learned in all courses of the curriculum in order to facilitate application of the material in real-life practice settings. During the fourth year, through experiential coursework, students will complete nine 160-hour Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience (APPE) courses, six in direct patient care areas and three selective experiences in specialty health care areas. APPEs continue the student's education by providing opportunities for the clinical application of patient care in a broad variety of health care environments and systems. At this point in the curriculum, it is expected that student pharmacists practice drug therapy monitoring with more independence. Each term of the fourth year curriculum includes a Professional Development Capstone course that offers student-initiated review and update of calculations and case-based drug therapy evaluations. During the final month of the fourth professional year, all students return to their respective sites for a week of live instruction and board exam preparation. Note: The advanced pharmacy practice experiences are full-time commitments for the students (a minimum of 40 hours per week). Students are responsible for having reliable transportation to attend assigned IPPE and APPE sites. Students may be required to secure accommodation at APPE sites away from their home location. Experiences may be taken in any sequence, however students may not enroll in advanced practice experiences until all didactic work has been satisfactorily completed. There are several APPE sites available in Puerto Rico. However, students College of Pharmacy\u2014Entr y-Level Program 89should expect to attend sites outside of the commonwealth of Puerto Rico for the completion of APPEs. Students must expect to use Florida sites for most experiences. The curriculum is designed so that knowledge gained in one semester becomes the foundation for material covered in subsequent semesters. Therefore, if students do not successfully complete the coursework specified for one semester, it will impede their ability to take courses in the future semesters. (Students have 60 days after the end of the semester to resolve any grade disputes; after that, the instructor may discard all materials from the semester.) This may lead to a delay in graduation. The program must be completed within six years from the date of matriculation. Travel Study Opportunities for travel study programs may be provided during the summer. Graduation Requirements To receive a degree, a student must fulfill the following requirements: be of good moral character pass all required courses complete a minimum of 145 semester hours of coursework in the College of Pharmacy within six years satisfactorily complete the assigned curriculum requirements for the degree, including all assignments, with a GPA of 2.0 on a four-point scale or a numerical average of 70 percent or above satisfactorily complete the P3 capstone examination satisfactorily meet all financial and library obligations complete a minimum of 30 credit hours of didactic coursework in addition to five advanced pharmacy practice experiences if transferring from another college of pharmacy submit to the registrar's office an application for degree /diploma by March 15. Applications received after March 15 will not be considered for that year's commencement, unless approved by the dean must satisfactorily complete all professional development capstone requirements must attend the commencement program in person receive approval by a College of Pharmacy faculty vote Entry-Level Curriculum Outline First Year\u2014Fall Semester Credits PHRC 4000 Medical T erminology (online) 0 PHRC 4110 Pharmaceutics I 3 PHRC 4200 Pharmacy Calculations PHRC 4210 Pharmaco dynamics I 3 PHRC 4300 Pharmacy and the U.S. Health Care Systems 2 PHRC 4410 Physiology and Pathophysiology I 4 PHRC 4580 Intro to Professionalism and Leadership I 1 PHRC 4700 Biochemistry 4 T otal 18 First 2 PHRC 4680 Intro duction to Professionalism and Leadership II 1 T otal 17 Second Year\u2014Fall Semester Credits PHRC 5000 Physical Assessment (hybrid) 2 PHRC 5230 Pharmaco dynamics III 4 PHRC 5300 Social and Behavioral Pharmacy 2 PHRC 5350 Research Design and Statistics 3 PHRC 5380 PHRC 5410 5700 Microbiology 20.5 Second 5150 dynamics Communication 2 PHRC 5420 Pharmacotherapy PHRC 5570 Biomedical 5680 IPPE: Community II 1.5 PHRC 5710 Patient Care Management Theory I 1 PHRL 5710 Patient Care Management Lab I 0 T otal 18.5 Third Year\u2014Fall Semester Credits PHRC 6250 Pharmaco Health System 6720 Patient Care Management Theory II 1 PHRL 6720 Patient Care Management Lab II 0 PHRE Elective 1 2 T otal 19 College of Pharmacy\u2014Entr y-Level Program 91Third Pharmacy 6680 IPPE: Pharmacy Service 2 PHRC 6730 Patient Care Management Theory III 1 PHRL 6730 Patient Care Management Lab III 0 PHRE Elective 2 2 PHRE Elective 3 2 T otal 16 Fourth Year\u2014Summer/Fall/Winter 7610 APPE: Care I 4 PHRC Community Patient Care II 4 PHRC Acute Patient Care I 4 PHRC Acute Patient Care II 7801 PHRC 7802 Capstone II 0 PHRC 7803 Professional Development Capstone III 0 T otal 36 IPPE = Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experience APPE = Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience The curriculum is frequently being revised and modified to meet the demands of the profession.

Upon completion of the degree program, students are eligible to take the North American Pharmacy Licensing Examination (NAPLEX). This opportunity is designed exclusively for graduates of pharmacy degree programs outside of the United States jurisdiction, allowing them to build upon their pharmacy education and prepare them for clinical pharmacy practice. The International Pharmacy Graduate curriculum educates students to achieve the same outcomes as the Entry-level Pharm.D. Degree Program. Courses integrate information and build on one another to provide students with the knowledge and skills necessary to be successful in the profession. Pharmacodynamics/Pharmacology and Nonprescription Therapies courses provide a strong understanding of the principles of drug therapy. The business, human relation, communication, and legal aspects of pharmacy and the health care system are also studied. Courses focus on application of material learned, the use of drugs in the disease process, and developing skills essential to monitoring drug therapy. Students hone their analytical skills with courses in pharmacoeconomics and outcomes research and biomedical literature evaluation. All students must complete a minimum of 4 semester hours of elective credit. Pharmacy practice experiences in community, hospital, and other traditional pharmacy settings facilitate real- life application of the material and provide opportunities to integrate information learned. Full-time practice experiences facilitate application of drug therapy monitoring with more independence. International pharmacists applying for the entry-level program may be awarded advanced standing based on their previous coursework. Advanced standing and the actual degree curriculum will vary based on the matriculant's previous pharmacy coursework. The curriculum provided is representative of a typical international pharmacist entering the entry-level program. The curriculum stresses innovative delivery and assessment methods. Courses will be on campus and will be taught by interactive video; the college's experiential sites will be used extensively. All lectures, handouts, reading materials, and exams will be in English.

Eligible students must request in-state tuition on their application. For tuition purposes, a student's Florida residency status (in-state or out-of-state) will be determined at initial matriculation and will remain the same throughout the entire enrollment of the student at NSU. Accordingly, tuition will not be adjusted as a result of any change in residency status after initial enrollment registration. Acceptance fee is $250. This fee is required to reserve the accepted applicant's place in the entering first-year class. This advance payment will be deducted from the first tuition payment, but is not refundable in case of withdrawal. It is payable within two weeks of the applicant's acceptance. Deposit is $750, due April 15, under the same terms as the acceptance fee. College laboratory/equipment fee is $50 per year, due at time of registration. The financial ability of applicants to complete their training is important because of the limited number of positions available. Applicants should have specific plans for financing four years of professional education. This should include provision for tuition, living expenses, books and equipment, travel, and miscellaneous expenses. Financial Aid The function of the Student Financial Assistance Program at Nova Southeastern University is to help as many qualified students as possible to complete their optometric education. Various loans, scholarships, and grants are available to qualified students to help ease the high cost of an optometric education. These financial assistance programs are described in a variety of separate university publications. Undergraduate /O.D. Dual Admission Program Nova Southeastern University Health Professions Division has established a dual admission program with the NSU Farquhar College of Arts and Sciences for a select number of highly motivated, qualified students interested in pursuing both undergraduate and professional studies in optometry. This allows students to receive their doctoral degree in optometry in seven years. Students must maintain a 3.0 GPA and achieve acceptable scores on the Optometry Admission Test (OAT). Students will spend three years in the undergraduate school and will be awarded a B.S. degree from the Farquhar College of Arts and Sciences upon completion of the first year of professional education at the NSU College of Optometry. Students will receive the O.D. (Doctor of Optometry) degree after four years of training at NSU College of Optometry.

Course of Study The Doctor of Optometry degree is awarded after successful completion of four years of professional study. The didactic focus of the first two years is in the basic sciences, including biochemistry, microbiology, anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, optics, and the vision sciences. Some of the basic science courses are taught in combined classes with other health care students. Concurrently, students initiate the study of general optometric theory and methods; general pathology; and the diagnosis, treatment, and management of binocular vision anomalies and ocular disease in preparation for direct patient care in our primary care clinic. In the third academic year, students study contact lenses, pediatric, geriatric, and rehabilitative optometry and develop a deeper understanding and ability to diagnose, treat, and manage increasingly complex conditions concerning anomalies of vision development and ocular disease. Additionally, students begin training in the primary care clinic by providing direct patient eye care. The fourth year of the academic program is entirely clinical with intensive training in university-based or affiliated primary, secondary, and tertiary care facilities. These include clinics dealing with contact lenses, pediatrics, binocular vision, low vision, and geriatric issues. Students also receive training in medical/ sur gical tertiary care settings. By the completion of the program, our students have been trained to be optometric physicians capable of providing quality eye care. Extended (Five-Year) Doctor of Optometry Degree The College of Optometry has instituted an extended program leading to the Doctor of Optometry (O.D.) degree. The extended program is designed for individuals who are returning to school after an absence, are changing professional fields, or who require a lighter course load initially because of family or other obligations. Students in the extended program take courses with the full time students but with a reduced course load. Coursework covered in the first two years of the traditional full-time program is covered in three years in the extended program. The last two years of both programs are identical. The curriculum and graduation requirements for the extended and full-time programs are the same. The enrollment for the extended program is limited. The dean of the College of Optometry will make the final determination on eligibility for the extended program. Tuition for 2013-2014 (subject to change by the board of trustees) is $22,215 for Florida residents and $25,045 for out-of-state residents for the first three years. Tuition reverts to the regular rate for the fourth and fifth years.

(3 credits) College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Occupational Therapy Department 163Occupational Therapy Department Occupational Therapy Program Overview Occupational therapists provide services to enhance participation and function in daily occupations, including self care, work, and leisure. Occupational therapists frequently work with individuals when performance has been interrupted or jeopardized by disease, injury, disability, life stress, or other factors. Therapy consists of clients' planned involvement in occupation\u2014purposeful and meaningful activities\u2014that positively influences their life adaptation. This involvement in occupation may be facilitated by supportive training, specialized equipment, environmental modification and/or problem solving to accomplish life tasks. The therapeutic process is founded upon the belief that individuals are the principal agents of their own adaptation, and through active involvement in occupation, can have a significant impact on their health status, and well-being. The occupational therapist must be an expert in the knowledge of occupation, its role in health and adaptation, and its use in therapy. Occupational therapy practice requires the therapist to exercise increasingly complex, autonomous decision-making and problem-solving skills in multifactorial situations. The therapist must, therefore, be a critical thinker, capable of evaluating and synthesizing information from a variety of sources about a wide range of phenomena. Finally, the therapist should be a reflective practitioner able to evaluate his or her own clinical reasoning. The NSU Occupational Therapy Department offers an entry-level Master of Occupational Therapy (M.O.T.) degree, an entry-level Doctor of Occupational Therapy (O.T.D.), and two postprofessional degrees: a Doctor of Occupational Therapy (Dr.OT), and a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.). The M.O.T. program is a full- time, campus-based entry-level program. The M.O.T. is designed so that a student may enter after completing an undergraduate or graduate degree from a regionally accredited college or university. The Dr.OT and Ph.D. are postprofessional OT degrees offered through distance education. Master of Occupational Therapy Accreditation The entry-level Master of Occupational Therapy is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education (ACOTE) of the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA), located at 4720 Montgomery Lane, Suite 200, Bethesda, Maryland 20814-3449. ACOTE's telephone number, care of AOTA, is (301) 652-AOTA. Graduates of the program will be eligible to sit for the national certification examination for the occupational therapist administered by the National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy (NBCOT). After successful completion of this exam, the individual will be an Occupational Therapist, Registered (OTR). In addition, most states require licensure in order to practice; however, state licenses are usually based on the results of the NBCOT certification examination. Note that a felony conviction may affect a graduate's ability to sit for the NBCOT certification examination or attain state licensure. Master of Occupational Therapy Admissions Requirements The Master of Occupational Therapy Program selects students based on grade point average (GPA), Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores, a written essay, letters of evaluation, and an interview.

Master of Occupational Therapy Course of Study The academic discipline of occupational therapy draws upon and integrates a wide range of interdisciplinary topics. Theories that illuminate the understanding of occupation in human life, the role of occupation in health and adaptation, and the art and science of using activities as therapeutic agents create the foundation for the discipline. As part of the regular curriculum, occupational therapy students are placed in fieldwork sites that require all students to be fingerprinted and subjected to a background check in accordance with regulations of the Child Care, Licensing and Enforcement Section, Bureau of Children's Services and Broward County, Florida. Additionally, some placement facilities may require criminal background checks and/or drug testing.

(3 credits) College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Physical Therapy Department 183Physical therapists are health care professionals who diagnose and treat movement dysfunction that results in physical impairment and disability. In addition to providing direct patient care services, physical therapists serve as administrators of physical therapy services, educators, and consultants. They screen people for potential risk for movement dysfunction in order to prevent impairment and disability and engage in critical inquiry to conduct and review research. Physical therapists work in a range of settings including acute and subacute care hospitals, rehabilitation centers, outpatient clinics, home health, skilled nursing facilities, school systems, and industrial settings. Physical therapists work as employees of health care systems, may independently contract their services, or own and manage a private practice. In any setting, for every patient, physical therapists perform a history and physical examination; conduct assessments to determine a diagnosis; select, perform, and supervise appropriate physical therapy interventions; and monitor the effectiveness of treatment. Physical therapists are licensed in all states and may practice without physician referral in most of them. They are integral members of health care teams in a variety of service systems who serve to improve and maintain the quality of life for millions of people. More than 900,000 people a day are helped by physical therapists to restore health, alleviate pain, and prevent the onset of disease. The mission of the Nova Southeastern University Department of Physical Therapy is to prepare entry- level and postprofessional physical therapists with the requisite skills needed to practice, educate, lead, and conduct research in interdisciplinary environments. The programs are committed to strategies that enhance the contemporary practice of physical therapy. The department promotes accessibility to physical therapy education through innovative instructional delivery models. Faculty and students are committed to active participation in the profession in all areas of scholarship, in mentoring, and in serving community populations, including the medically underserved and uninsured, through service learning and clinical education experiences.

(2 credits) The Physical Therapy Department at Nova Southeastern University offers two postgraduate programs for practicing physical therapists: the clinical doctorate\u2014or transition Doctor of Physical Therapy (T-D.P .T.), and the research doctorate\u2014the Doctor of Philosophy in Physical Therapy (Ph.D., P .T.). These two distinct programs are designed to meet the diverse needs of physical therapists who are seeking to advance their education and skills from an accredited institution. Applicants with a baccalaureate or master's degree may be accepted for either of these doctoral programs. Both programs are offered primarily in an online format to meet the needs of working professionals. There is an on-campus component for each core course taken, generally one-two days per course, per semester. Nova Southeastern University is a recognized leader of distance education and has a well-respected history of innovation and leadership in the health professions. Transition Doctor of Physical Therapy Program (T-D.P .T.) Given the increasingly complex health care environment and the growing body of knowledge in the physical therapy profession, entry-level education in physical therapy has rapidly shifted toward the clinical doctoral degree. The vision of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) is that by the year 2020, physical therapy will be provided by physical therapists who are doctors of physical therapy. In support of this vision, the Physical Therapy Department at Nova Southeastern University offers the transition Doctor of Physical Therapy (T-D.P .T.) Program. The transition D.P .T. program is a postprofessional curriculum designed to advance the knowledge, attitudes, and skills of practicing physical therapists to those commensurate with the current entry- level doctorate in physical therapy. This program focuses on the professional roles of the D.P .T., clinical reasoning and differential diagnosis, evidence-based practice, and patient/ client management related to optimizing movement, function, and health. The degree awarded upon completion of the program is the Doctor of Physical Therapy degree. Program Outcomes The transition D.P .T. program will prepare physical therapists who will make clinical decisions based on experience and evidence in the research literature by posing clear clinical questions, selecting appropriate databases to find peer-reviewed literature, and interpreting the evidence engage in clinical reasoning, including the use of deductive reasoning or disablement models, as part of the patient/client management process evidenced in patient documentation select valid/reliable tests, outcome measures, and interventions that are supported by the literature and appropriate for the patient, setting, and diagnostic classification plan and implement prevention, wellness, and health promotion programs using principles of behavior change theory and sound teaching strategiesPostprofessional Doctoral Programs in Physical Therapy206 College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Physical Therapy Department screen all patients for medical disease, distinguishing musculoskeletal from medical conditions to identify when referral to other practitioners is needed use professional standards and principles of teaching, learning, and communicating to develop and implement education programs for patients, communities, and professionals identify key pharmacologic classifications and their relevance to physical therapy interpret radiology/imaging tests as they relate to clinical anatomy and signs/symptoms of pathology use contemporary principles of motor control and motor learning when teaching a patient a novel skill or retraining a motor task develop an appropriate exercise program for any patient/ client based on safe and accurate exercise testing and a patient's specific or potential problems engage in analytical processes using objective measures and sound principles of organizational management and administration to effect change while acting in the role of consultant, administrator, or manager engage in consultative activities using objective outcome measures that consider both the internal and external environment in creating change and apply the principles of organizational management, administration, and group processes, demonstrating the ability to self-reflect on the role of a D.P .T. to effect change demonstrate skills that support lifelong learning, including applying current research literature to clinical decision making, utilizing computer technology to access resources or to communicate with peers, and self assessing to identify learning needs and generate professional goals Admissions Requirements The following are requirements for admission: 1.

(1 credit) *218 College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Physician Assistant DepartmentPhysician Assistant Department\u2014 Fort Lauderdale Physician assistants (PAs) serve as essential components of a medical system that continues to struggle to provide quality, affordable health care for all Americans. Their roles in the system will continue to grow as changes in health care indicate. Today, more than 81,000 individuals are in practice as PAs in the United States. PAs provide care that would otherwise be provided by physicians. PAs take medical histories, perform physical examinations, order and interpret tests, diagnose and treat illnesses, perform medical /surgical procedures, assist in surgery , and can write prescriptions in all states. PAs work in most medical specialities and in all types of communities. Many PAs practice family and internal medicine, and more than one-third are in towns with fewer than 50,000 residents. The PA profession is one of the fastest growing health care professions. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that employment of PAs is expected to grow 39 percent from 2008 to 2018. It is the obligation of each physician /P A team to ensure that the PA's scope of practice is identified; that delegation of medical tasks is appropriate to the PA's level of competence; that the relationship of, and access to, the supervisory physician is defined; and that a process of performance evaluation is established. Adequate responsible supervision of the PA contributes to both high-quality patient care and professional growth. The Physician Assistant Department offers an innovative program that lasts 27 months. Upon successful completion of study, students will be awarded the master of medical science degree in physician assistant. The curriculum includes rigorous instruction in basic science subjects, followed by clinical medicine, physical diagnosis, clinical laboratory medicine, clinical pathophysiology, clinical procedures and surgical skills, electrocardiography, pharmacology, radiology, and others. During the clinical year of study, the student participates in challenging clinical rotations at a variety of health care facilities associated with the program. These rotations include family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, gynecology and prenatal care, emergency medicine, and surgery, all complemented by three elective rotations. NSU graduates are prepared to work in many clinical areas, both in primary care and specialty medicine. Accreditation The NSU Physician Assistant Program is accredited by the Accreditation Review Commission for Physician Assistants, Inc., (ARC-PA). The NSU Physician Assistant Program has enjoyed continuing accreditation since its inception and was recently awarded continuing accreditation until 2015, a seven-year term, the longest allowed by ARC-PA. The department is a member of the Physician Assistant Education Association (PAEA).Mission Statement To provide a primary care training program designed for, and dedicated to, producing competent physician assistants who will provide quality health care in rural, urban, underserved, and culturally diverse communities; to increase the accessibility of quality health care in the primary care setting; to prepare students for lifelong learning and leadership roles; and to promote the physician assistant profession.

(54-0-4) Physician Assistant Department\u2014 Southwest Florida Physician assistants (PAs) serve as essential components of a medical system that continues to struggle to provide quality, affordable health care for all Americans. Their roles in the system will continue to grow as changes in health care indicate. Today, there are more than 86,000 nationally certified physician assistants in the United States. PAs provide care that would otherwise be provided by physicians. PAs take medical histories, perform physical examinations, order and interpret tests, diagnose and treat illnesses, perform medical /surgical procedures, assist in surgery, and can write prescriptions in all states. PAs work in most medical specialties and in all types of communities. Many practice family and internal medicine, and more than one-third are in towns with fewer than 50,000 residents. Forbes.com ranked physician assistant studies as the number one best master's degree for jobs in 2012. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that employment of PAs is expected to grow 30 percent from 2010 to 2020. It is the obligation of each physician /P A team to ensure that the PA's scope of practice is identified; that delegation of medical tasks is appropriate to the PA's level of competence; that the relationship with, and access to, the supervisory physician is defined; and that a process of performance evaluation is established. Adequate responsible supervision of the PA contributes to both high- quality patient care and professional growth.The Physician Assistant Department\u2014Southwest Florida offers an innovative program that lasts 27 months. Upon successful completion of study, students will earn a master of medical science (M.M.S.) in physician assistant degree. The curriculum includes rigorous instruction in the basic sciences, clinical medicine, physical diagnosis, clinical laboratory medicine, clinical pathophysiology, clinical procedures and surgical skills, electrocardiography, radiology, clinical behavioral medicine, legal and ethical issues in health care, cultural issues in health care, interpretation and evaluation of medical literature, complementary medicine and nutrition, and clinical pharmacology. During the clinical year of study, the student participates in clinical rotations throughout the state of Florida, primarily within 80-100 miles from NSU's Fort Myers Student Educational Center. These rotations include family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, gynecology and prenatal care, emergency medicine, and surgery, all complemented by three elective rotations. Each student should expect to complete one or more rotations in a rural or underserved area. This will likely entail traveling beyond the 80-100 mile radius of Fort Myers. For core rotations assigned by the program outside of the 100-mile radius, housing will be provided for the student. With a sound foundation in medical training, NSU graduates are prepared to work in many clinical areas, both in primary care and specialty medicine.228 College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Physician Assistant DepartmentAccreditation The NSU Physician Assistant Program\u2014Southwest Florida is accredited by the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for Physician Assistants, Inc., (ARC-PA).

Readmission Policy in the Physician Assistant Program In selected cases, and only with the approval of the department chair and college dean, a student may be allowed to be noncompetitively matriculated with the next first-year class. It is emphasized that this only refers to those few students with special academic or personal issues. Course of Study The Physician Assistant Program curriculum is completed following attainment of a baccalaureate degree, including specified course prerequisites. The comprehensive curriculum, completed in a consecutive manner, is oriented to primary care and prepares the student to practice in a wide variety of clinical settings. The first 14.5 months of study consist of basic sciences and clinically related didactic courses. All courses are required and must be successfully completed before advancing to the clinical year. During this time frame, students are generally in class from Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., although there are occasional evening and/or weekend hours. Because of its highly integrated and compact curriculum, the PA department requires matriculants to complete the entire curriculum at NSU Southwest Florida and will not grant requests for advanced placement, transfer of credit, or credit for experiential learning. The clinical year is devoted to 12.5 months of clinical training with required clinical rotations in family medicine, emergency medicine, pediatrics, prenatal care/gynecology, surgery, and internal medicine. The students also complete three elective rotations, for a total of nine clinical rotations. The required subject rotations and two of the elective rotations are six weeks in length. The remaining elective rotation is four weeks in length. All required rotations must be completed in the state of Florida, primarily in an area within 100 miles from the Fort Myers Student Educational Center. Each student should expect to complete at least one rotation in a rural or underserved area. This will likely entail traveling beyond the 80-100 mile radius of Fort Myers. For core rotations assigned by the program outside of the 100-mile radius, housing will be provided for the student.Each required rotation has assigned readings and learning objectives. At the end of each required rotation, a written comprehensive subject examination is administered and must be passed. During rotations, students will be supervised by licensed practitioners and will actively participate in patient assessments, perform common laboratory procedures, interpret common diagnostic examinations, and help manage common medical problems. The work hours during clinical rotations are set by the preceptor and can include evening and weekend hours. Students are required to work a minimum of 40 hours per week, although many rotation sites require a greater student participation. Upon completion of the course of study, students will have earned a master of medical science (M.M.S.) in physician assistant degree. Graduates will be eligible to take the Physician Assistant National Certification Examination (PANCE) administered by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants (NCCPA). The role of the physician assistant requires a high level of expertise and responsibility. The applicant must possess the ability and desire to complete a rigorous academic and clinical program and make a commitment to continued learning.232 College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Physician Assistant DepartmentCurriculum Outline for the Master of Medical Science (M.M.S.) in Physician Assistant Program\u2014Southwest Florida Start Date: May/June Length: 27 months Degree: Master of Medical Science (M.M.S.) in Physician Assistant Didactic: 14.5 months Clinical: 12.5 months First Semester\u2014Summer (May/June-August) Lecture Laboratory Credit Hours P AN 5000 Anatomy 55 38 5 P AN 5100 Physiology 54 0 3 P AN 5300 Physical Diagnosis I 42 20 3 P AN 5400 History T aking and Communication Skills 18 0 1 P AN 5003 Fundamentals of Medical Imaging 18 0 1 P AN 5002 Intro duction to the PA Profession 16 0 1 P AN 5409 Cultural Issues in Health Care 30 0 2 T otal Hours: 233 58 16 Second Semester\u2014Fall (August-December) Lecture Laboratory Credit Hours P AN 5200 Microbiology 45 0 3 P AN 5403 Legal and Ethical Issues in Health Care 45 0 3 P AN 5310 Physical Diagnosis II 36 36 3 P AN 5410 Pharmacology I 38 0 2 P AN 5500 Clinical Medicine and Surgery I 112 0 7 P AN 5600 Clinical Laboratory Medicine I 36 4 2 P AN 5006 Electrocardiology 30 6 2 P AN 5102 Clinical Pathophysiology I 15 0 1 T otal Hours: 357 46 23 College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Physician Assistant Department 233Third Semester\u2014Winter (January-May) Lecture Laboratory Credit Hours P AN 5320 Physical Diagnosis III 50 30 4 P AN 5510 Clinical Medicine and Surgery II 120 0 8 P AN 5103 Clinical Pathophysiology II 15 0 1 P AN 5520 Clinical Medicine and Surgery III 112 0 7 P AN 5104 Clinical Pathophysiology III 15 0 1 P AN 5610 Clinical Laboratory Medicine II 32 0 2 P AN 5420 Pharmacology II 72 0 4 P AN 5540 Clinical Behavioral Medicine 45 0 3 T otal Hours: 461 30 30 Fourth Semester\u2014Summer II Advanced Didactic (May-July/August) Lecture Laboratory Credit Hours P AN 5461 Life Support Procedures and Skills 24 40 3 P AN 5560 Clinical Procedures and Surgical Skills 44 24 3 P AN 5008 Health Promotion and Disease Prevention 22 0 1 P AN 5009 P A and Health Care Dynamics 30 0 2 P AN 5411 Complementary Medicine and Nutrition 30 0 2 P AN 5419 Clinical Pharmacology 46 0 3 P AN 5423 Interpretation and Evaluation of Medical Literature 50 30 4 T otal Hours: 246 94 18 Clinical Curriculum\u2014Second Year (August-August) W eeks Contact Hours Credit Hours P AN 6310 Emergency Medicine 6 270 6 P AN 6320 Family Medicine 6 250 6 P AN 6330 Internal Medicine 6 270 6 P AN 6340 Pediatrics 6 240 6 P AN 6350 Prenatal Care and Gynecology 6 270 6 P AN 6360 Surgery 6 300 4 P AN 6370 Clinical Elective I 6 270 6 P AN 6375 Clinical Elective II 6 270 6 P AN 6380 Clinical Elective III 4 160 4 P AN 6601 Graduate Project 0 0 3 T otal Hours: 52 2,300 55 Curriculum is subject to change as directed by the department.234 College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Physician Assistant DepartmentNote: Listed at the end of each entry are lecture clock hours, laboratory clock hours, and semester hours. *Core competency course PAN 5000\u2014Anatomy Gross structures of the human body.

(4-90-3) College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Physician Assistant Department 237Physician Assistant Department\u2014Orlando Physician assistants (PAs) serve as an essential component of a medical system that continues to strive to provide quality, affordable health care for all individuals. Their roles in the system will continue to grow as changes in health care indicate. Today, more than 81,000 individuals are in practice as PAs in the United States. PAs provide care that would otherwise be provided by physicians. PAs take medical histories, perform physical examinations, order and interpret tests, diagnose and treat illnesses, perform medical/surgical procedures, assist in surgery, and can write prescriptions in all states. PAs work in most medical specialties and in all types of communities. Many practice in primary care settings, and more than one-third are in towns with fewer than 50,000 residents. The PA profession is one of the fastest growing health care professions. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that employment of PAs is expected to grow 39 percent from 2008 to 2018. It is the obligation of each physician/PA team to ensure that the PA's scope of practice is identified; that delegation of medical tasks is appropriate to the PA's level of competence; that the relationship of, and access to, the supervisory physician is defined; and that a process of performance evaluation is established. Adequate responsible supervision of the PA contributes to both high-quality patient care and professional growth. The Physician Assistant Department\u2014Orlando offers a modern program that lasts 27 months. Upon successful completion of study, the student is awarded a Master of Medical Science degree in Physician Assistant. The curriculum includes rigorous instructions in basic science subjects, followed by clinical medicine, physical diagnosis, clinical laboratory medicine, clinical pathophysiology, clinical procedures, surgical skills, electrocardiography and radiology, and psychiatry. The student also takes courses in the Master of Medical Science program including health care law and ethics, epidemiology and biostatistics, research methodology, cultural issues in health care, publication skills, and medical research, as well as a graduate project. During the clinical year of study, the student participates in clinical rotations predominantly in Central Florida. Required six-week rotations include family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, gynecology and prenatal care, emergency medicine, general surgery, and one selective of six weeks from one of the following areas: dermatology, otorhinolaryngology, or orthopedics. The clinical year contains one six-week and one four-week elective rotation. With a sound foundation in medical training, NSU graduates are prepared to work in many clinical areas, both in primary care and specialty medicine.Accreditation The NSU Physician Assistant Program\u2014Orlando has been awarded accreditation from the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for Physician Assistants, Inc., (ARC-PA). The next review for Continuing Accreditation is to be completed in March 2014. The department is a member of the Physician Assistant Education Association (PAEA).

Each student is required to carry adequate personal medical and hospital insurance. Students may avail themselves of the hospitalization insurance plan obtainable through the university. Due to the demands of the PA curriculum, the program discourages any outside employment. The program does not allow working for NSU or any of the associated clinical training sites. Requirements for Graduation In order to be eligible to graduate from the Physician Assistant Program, students must successfully complete all academic and clinical courses and degree requirements have satisfactorily met all financial and library obligations attend, in person, the commencement program, at which time the degree is conferredAcademic Dismissal in the Physician Assistant Program See the suspension/dismissal section of the student handbooks. Readmission Policy in the Physician Assistant Program In selected cases, and only with the approval of the department chair and college dean, a student may be allowed to be noncompetitively matriculated with the next first-year class. It is emphasized that this only refers to those few students with special academic or personal issues. Remediation Policy The Nova Southeastern University Physician Assistant Program\u2014Orlando is an intense academic experience. Students will encounter both written and performance- based examinations. In specific courses, (Physical Exam/ diagnosis, Clinical Medicine, and Surgery, etc.) all blocks of instruction must be successfully passed by the student in order to pass the entire course. All students are aware of their performance at the end of every test. If a student fails to demonstrate the required competencies for a specific exam or block of instruction, he or she will be notified and certain actions shall be taken. Students will receive email notification of failed grades from the academic coordinator. The student will meet with his or her academic adviser and/or the course director/ instructor in order to discuss the academic situation and develop a plan of action for improving his or her academic deficiencies. The student will review the plan of action for improvement and grade sheets and sign them. Students will coordinate a retesting date with the course director and that will be within seven calendar days of the test failure or a mutually agreed upon date. The student must be proactive in coordinating additional study/tutoring time before the retest. If the student successfully passes the retest, the student will receive a maximum score of 75 percent with an E. If the student fails to demonstrate mastery of the course objectives by failing the retest, the student's case will be forwarded to the Committee on Student Progress for further review and possible academic and administrative action. Recommendations will be referred to the department chair for final disposition. College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Physician Assistant Department 241Course of Study The Physician Assistant Program curriculum is completed following an acceptable bachelor's degree. The comprehensive PA curriculum, completed in a consecutive manner, is oriented to primary care and prepares the student to practice in a wide variety of clinical settings. The first 15 months of study consist of basic sciences and clinically related didactic courses. All courses are required and must be successfully completed before advancing to the next semester or the clinical year. During this time frame, students are generally in class from Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 4:20 p.m., although there may be occasional evening and/or weekend hours. Because of its highly integrated and compact curriculum, the PA department requires matriculants to complete the entire curriculum at NSU. Therefore, no requests for advanced placement, transfer of credit, and credit for experiential learning will be considered. The clinical year is devoted to 12 months of clinical training with required six-week clinical rotations in family medicine, internal medicine, emergency medicine, pediatrics, prenatal care/gynecology, general surgery, as well as a selective rotation in orthopedics, dermatology, or otorhinolaryngology and a six-week and a four-week elective. The rotations are as follows: Emergency Medicine (six weeks) Family Medicine (six weeks) Internal Medicine (six weeks) Pediatrics (six weeks) Prenatal Care and Gynecology (six weeks) General Surgery (six weeks) Selective (six weeks in one of the following three courses) O rthopedics (six weeks) Dermatology (six weeks) Otorhinolaryngology (six weeks) Elective (six weeks) Elective (four weeks) Graduate Project (each semester) Each required rotation has assigned readings and learning objectives. At the end of each required rotation, a written, comprehensive subject examination is administered and must be passed. The six-week elective rotation requires the submission of documents as defined in the Orlando Clinical Handbook and rotation syllabi as related to the rotation. A comprehensive, written, summative examination is administered as a component of the four-week elective and must be passed. During rotations, students will be supervised by licensed practitioners and will actively participate in patient assessments, perform common laboratory procedures, interpret common diagnostic examinations, and help manage common medical problems as required by the program and the ARC-PA standards. Testing on required specialty rotations will occur on scheduled end-of-rotation days (EORs). OSCE, Pack Rat, and other testing may occur as scheduled during EORs. Comprehensive, computerized patient logs are to be completed and submitted as directed prior to EORs. Weekly Exam Master tests must be submitted to advisers at the scheduled times. The work hours during clinical rotations are set by the preceptor and can include evening and weekend hours. Students are required to work a minimum of 40 hours per week, however, many rotation sites require a greater student participation. Upon completion of the course of study, students will have earned a Master of Medical Science (M.M.S.) in Physician Assistant degree. Graduates will be eligible to take the Physician Assistant National Certification Examination (PANCE) administered by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants. The role of the physician assistant requires a high level of expertise and responsibility. The applicant must possess the ability and desire to complete a rigorous academic and clinical program and make a commitment to lifelong learning and becoming a professional.242 College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Physician Assistant DepartmentCurriculum Outline for the Master of Medical Science (M.M.S.) in Physician Assistant Program\u2014Orlando Start Date: June Length: 27 months Degree: Master of Medical Science (M.M.S.) in Physician Assistant Didactic: 15 months Clinical: 12 months First Semester\u2014Summer I (June-August) Lecture Lab Credit Hours P AO 5000 Anatomy 48 32 4 P AO 5001 Pharmaco dynamics 16 0 1 P AO 5002 Intro duction to the PA Profession 28 0 2 P AO 5100 Physiology 48 0 3 P AO 5300 Physical Diagnosis I 22 44 3 P AO 5400 History T aking and Communication Skills 20 20 2 P AO 5406 Cultural Issues in Health Care 30 0 2 P AO 5605 Clinical Laboratory Medicine 40 0 3 T otal Hours: 252 96 20 Second Semester\u2014Fall (September-December) Lecture Lab Credit Hours P AO 5003 Fundamentals of Medical Imaging 28 0 2 P AO 5006 Electrocardiography 16 0 1 P AO 5104 Clinical Pathophysiology 46 0 3 P AO 5200 Microbiology 42 0 3 P AO 5310 Physical Diagnosis II 20 36 3 P AO 5404 Legal and Ethical Issues in Health Care 42 0 3 P AO 5410 Pharmacology I 32 0 2 P AO 5421 Epidemiology/Biostatistics in Health Care 44 0 3 P AO 5500 Clinical Medicine and Surgery I 114 0 7 T otal Hours: 384 36 27 Third Semester\u2014Winter (January-May) Lecture Lab Credit Hours P AO 5422 Research Metho dology 44 0 3 P AO 5320 Physical Diagnosis III 34 42 5 P AO 5420 Pharmacology II 64 0 4 P AO 5510 Clinical Medicine and Surgery II 168 0 8 P AO 5520 Clinical Medicine and Surgery III 118 0 7 P AO 5540 Clinical Behavioral Medicine 45 0 3 T otal Hours: 473 42 30 College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Physician Assistant Department 243Fourth Semester\u2014Summer II Advanced Didactic (June-July) Lecture Lab Credit Hours P AO 5005 Genetics 16 0 1 P AO 5008 Health Promotion and Disease Prevention 20 0 1 P AO 5009 P A and Health Care Dynamics 30 0 2 P AO 5407 Clinical Pharmacology 18 0 1 P AO 5408 Complementary Medicine and Nutrition 28 0 2 P AO 5412 Publication Skills and Medical Research 30 60 4 P AO 5460 Life Support Procedures and Skills 24 24 3 P AO 5560 Clinical Procedures and Surgical Skills 32 32 3 T otal Hours: 198 116 17 Clinical Curriculum\u2014Second Year (August-August) W eeks Contact* Credit Hours P AO 6401 Elective I 4 160 4 P AO 6402 Elective II 6 240 6 P AO 6498 Graduate Project I 0 0 1 P AO 6499 Graduate Project II 0 0 1 P AO 6500 Graduate Project III 0 0 1 P AO 6310 Emergency Medicine 6 300 6 P AO 6320 Family Medicine 6 255 6 P AO 6330 Internal Medicine 6 270 6 P AO 6340 Pediatrics 6 270 6 P AO 6350 Prenatal Care and Gynecology 6 270 6 P AO 6360 General Surgery 6 300 6 P AO 6406 Selective (choose one of three**) 6 270 6 Orthopedics Dermatology Otorhinolaryngology T otal Weeks/Hours/Credits (second year) 52 2,335 55 *factors in time for inpatient rounds, grand rounds, extra reading assignments, and projects **one of three selectives required, may use other selectives as electives Curriculum is subject to change as directed by the department.244 College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Physician Assistant Departmentof these topics, in addition to the knowledge and clinical skills taught during the academic year, will be reiterated and re-enforced.

Final summer semester (0-0-1)248 College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Physician Assistant DepartmentPhysician Assistant Department\u2014 Jacksonville Physician assistants (PAs) serve as essential components of a medical system that continues to struggle to provide quality, affordable health care for all Americans. Their roles in the system will continue to grow as changes in health care indicate. Today, more than 81,000 individuals are in practice as PAs in the United States. PAs provide care that would otherwise be provided by physicians. PAs take medical histories, perform physical examinations, order and interpret tests, diagnose and treat illnesses, perform medical/surgical procedures, assist in surgery, and can write prescriptions in all states. PAs work in most medical specialties and in all types of communities. Many PAs practice family and internal medicine, and more than one-third are in towns with fewer than 50,000 residents. The PA profession is one of the fastest growing health care professions. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that employment of PAs is expected to grow 39 percent from 2008 to 2018. It is the obligation of each physician/PA team to ensure that the PA's scope of practice is identified; that delegation of medical tasks is appropriate to the PA's level of competence; that the relationship with, and access to, the supervisory physician is defined; and that a process of performance evaluation is established. Adequate responsible supervision of the PA contributes to both high- quality patient care and professional growth. The Physician Assistant Department offers an innovative program that lasts 27 months. Upon successful completion of study, students will be awarded the Master of Medical Science Degree in Physician Assistant. The curriculum includes rigorous instruction in basic science subjects, followed by clinical medicine, physical diagnosis, clinical laboratory medicine, clinical pathophysiology, clinical procedures and surgical skills, electrocardiography, pharmacology, radiology, and others. Students also take courses that include health care law and ethics, epidemiology and biostatistics, research methodology, and cultural issues in health care. During the clinical year of study, the student participates in clinical rotations. These rotations include family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, gynecology and prenatal care, emergency medicine, and surgery, all complemented by three elective rotations. NSU graduates are prepared to work in many clinical areas, both in primary care and specialty medicine.

The first 15 months of study consist of basic sciences and clinically related didactic courses. All courses are required and must be successfully completed before advancing to the clinical year. During this time frame, students are generally in class from Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., although there are occasional evening and/or weekend hours. Because of its highly integrated and compact curriculum, the PA department requires matriculants to complete the entire curriculum at this campus. No advanced placement, transfer of credit, or credit for experiential learning will be granted. The clinical year is devoted to 12 months of clinical training with required clinical rotations in family medicine, emergency medicine, pediatrics, prenatal care/ gynecology, surgery, and internal medicine. Students must also complete three elective rotations, for a total of nine clinical rotations. The required rotations and two of the elective rotations are six weeks in length. The remaining elective rotation is four weeks in length. Each required rotation has assigned readings and learning objectives. At the end of each required rotation, a written, comprehensive subject examination is administered and must be passed. During rotations, students will be supervised by licensed practitioners and will actively participate in patient assessments, perform common laboratory procedures, interpret common diagnostic examinations, and help manage common medical problems. The work hours during clinical rotations are set by the preceptor and can include evening and weekend hours. Students are required to work a minimum of 40 hours per week, however, many rotation sites require students to work substantially more hours per week. Upon completion of the course of study, students will be awarded the Master of Medical Science degree in Physician Assistant. Graduates will be eligible to take the Physician Assistant National Certification Examination (PANCE) administered by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants.

Each course contains at least eight pages (approximately 2,000 words or their equivalent) of writing, with faculty members providing feedback on these assignments. Written assignments can include, but are not limited to, essays, summaries, memos, lesson plans, journal entries, lab reports, project proposals, progress reports, case studies, and project reviews.260 College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Department of Health ScienceGeneral Education Program The General Education Program is designed to foster critical skills by helping students develop the ability to solve problems, think analytically, and communicate clearly. The program provides a common connection among all NSU undergraduates through a rigorous set of writing; mathematics; humanities; and social, biological, and physical science requirements. As a result of the General Education Program, students develop effective communication skills in speaking, listening, writing, reading, and critical interpretation. The program also helps students place ideas in their proper context and appreciate the role of different cultural traditions. General Education Program Framework All students are required to complete general education requirements. Students normally complete general education requirements by the end of their junior year through a series of courses in the areas of communication (including written communication and oral communication), mathematics, humanities (including literature, history, ethics, and general humanities), social and behavioral sciences, and biological and physical sciences.Using General Education Credits for Major and Minor Requirements Most courses may count toward both general education and major/minor requirements. Students should refer to their program curriculum and consult their academic adviser to determine which courses serve both sets of requirements. General Education Learning Outcomes Upon successful completion of the General Education Program, students are expected to 1. think critically by a. solving problems b. analyzing data and concepts 2. communicate clearly by a. speaking effectively b. listening effectively c. writing effectively d. reading effectively e. developing clear , coherent, and consistent interpretations 3. place ideas in their proper context 4. explain the key elements of a variety of cultural traditions B.H.Sc.

College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Department of Health Science 263Students with credits, health care or academic experiences, certificates, diplomas or degrees from nationally accredited colleges, military training or other educational training / experiences should refer to the section below tilted: Assessment of Prior Experiences for Academic Credit in order to apply to convert these prior experiences into academic credit. Assessment of Prior Experiences for Academic Credit Nova Southeastern University has established four different mechanisms for students to convert their prior experiences into academic credit. Students must initiate all requests for experiential learning credit before they complete 24 credits at NSU. Credits will be transcripted after 12 credits are successfully earned at NSU. For additional information, contact the B.H.Sc. Program or the Office of Prior Learning Assessment at (954) 262-8414 or 800-356- 0026, ext. 28414, or via email at miletsky@nsu.nova.edu. 1. CLEP/DANTES/ACT -PEP/Computer Test-Out Students can demonstrate their knowledge in a variety of areas by taking objective tests. The coordinator of experiential learning can provide further information about these tests as can the testing office in Academic Services. 2. Nationally Accredited School Portfolios Students who have attended nationally accredited institutions have the opportunity to write school portfolios. The coordinator of experiential learning works with each student in reviewing the student's nationally accredited institutional transcript to identify courses that may be applied toward his or her academic goal. 3. Full Portfolio\u2014Course Challenge The full portfolio is the process for challenging a college- level course for credit. Through this mechanism, a student presents his or her knowledge on a topic and has it evaluated by a faculty member. A maximum of 25 percent of a student's credits may be earned through the full portfolio process. 4. Standard Grant Certain training courses, military experiences, or licenses may be converted into college credit. This can be done by supplying some very basic documentation. For military training programs the recommendations contained in the Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the Armed Forces from the American Council on Education, will be used to evaluate such training for credit transfer. Examples include Combat Casualty and Flight Medicine Courses of training. Distance Education Support Distance education students in the B.H.Sc. Program are provided with NSU computer accounts including email. The student, however, must obtain their own Internet service providers (ISP) and use their own computer systems (IBM-compatible PC or Apple Macintosh and a modem). New students receive an orientation and extensive online technical support online access, online tools and methods, and library resources. Online interactive learning methods involve Web pages to access course materials, announcements, the electronic library, and other information, plus a range of online activities that facilitate frequent student-professor interaction. Faculty members and students interact via online forums using threaded bulletin boards, chat rooms, and email. Students are able to submit assignments as email attachments, through the use of online forms sent directly to program instructors, fax to fax, fax to email, and through WebCT. Some online courses may include electronic classroom sessions. Online students have access to books, journal articles, microfiche, dissertations, index searches, catalog searches, and reference librarians. The online medical database collection at NSU is extensive and includes access to quality subscription services free of charge to the student. Technical Help The Online Computing Help Desk of NSU's Office of Information Technology provides telephone and email support to NSU students and faculty and staff members. Support services include assistance with connecting to NSU's online computing systems; navigating through the WebCT system; resolving Personal Identification Number (PIN) issues; supporting wireless computing on campus; and configuring various software programs such as Microsoft Outlook, Netscape Navigator, and Internet Explorer.

College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Department of Health Science 267Bachelor of Health Science\u2014 Cardiovascular Sonography (On-Campus, Entry-Level, Tampa) Diagnostic medical sonography includes three primary areas of specialization: general, cardiac, and vascular. General sonography includes subspecialties for obstetrics and gynecology exams, exams of the soft tissues and organs of the body, and exams of structures such as joints and tendons. Vascular sonography studies the anatomical and physiological characteristics of all arteries and veins in the body. Cardiac sonography examines the anatomical structure and function of the heart. Cardiovascular technology consists of five areas of specialization: cardiac sonography (adult), cardiac sonography cardiology (angiograms and other catheter- based technology). The demand for all diagnostic medical sonographers and for all cardiovascular specialists is projected to increase, primarily due to the aging of the \"Baby Boom\" generation, as seniors are generally more prone to cardiac and vascular problems. The NSU Cardiovascular Sonography Program in Tampa offers didactic and clinical training in two of these specialties, cardiac sonography (adult) and vascular sonography, as an integrated curriculum. Additional course content introduces the student to pediatric cardiac sonography and basic concepts in electrophysiological cardiology. Because of strong interrelationships between cardiac and vascular diseases, the need was seen for a comprehensive program covering both specialties. Also, some cardiology departments and other imaging providers may prefer that sonographers obtain training and professional registry in both cardiac sonography and vascular sonography for purposes of diagnostic expediency and professional flexibility. Program Objectives to graduate competent, entry-level cardiovascular technologists who are qualified to perform a variety of standard and specialized diagnostic vascular and cardiac examinations to ensure that graduates are qualified to take and successfully pass at least one sonographic specialty national credentialing exam, in either cardiac or vascular ultrasound, from either the American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonography (ARDMS) or Cardiovascular Credentialing International (CCI) to prepare graduates for future leadership roles in cardiac, vascular, or combined cardiovascular laboratories and ultrasound departments to enhance students' academic skills for pursuing research studies or education in cardiac and vascular sonographyUpon successful completion of the bachelor's-degree level cardiovascular sonography specialization, students are eligible to apply for admission to the Master of Health Science (M.H.Sc.), and later the Doctor of Health Science (D.H.Sc.) programs. Each of these programs is an online degree program, with the M.H.Sc. having no residency requirement and the D.H.Sc. having a requirement for students to complete two one-week summer institutes. Curriculum Overview Admission to the program requires the completion of a minimum of 33 semester hours of general education coursework. The core of the cardiovascular sonography course of study includes 102 semester hours. The entire program requires a total of 135 semester hours for a student to graduate with a Bachelor of Health Science\u2014 Cardiovascular Sonography.

Cardiac sonography examines the anatomical structure and function of the heart and is subdivided into three different subspecialties: adult echocardiography, fetal echocardiography, and pediatric echocardiography. Vascular sonography studies the anatomical and physiological characteristics of blood vessels (veins and arteries) in the human body. The most recently created specialty in sonography is musculoskeletal sonography. This specialty studies the different joints and tendons in the body. Diagnostic medical sonography uses mechanical, nonionizing sound waves to obtain images and is considered a noninvasive modality. General Sonography Professionals in this field are called sonographers or medical sonographers. Sonographers use diagnostic medical ultrasound to obtain images of internal organs such as the liver, gallbladder, bile ducts, pancreas, spleen, appendix, kidneys, and adrenal glands. They also can obtain images from superficial glands and soft tissues. Sonographers specializing in obstetrics and gynecology obtain images of the female pelvic organs and the fetus, while those specializing in neurosonology obtain images of the brain and its blood vessels. Sonographers working in all these specialties determine normal from abnormal situations and contribute to the making of a diagnosis of pathologies affecting those organs.Vascular Sonography Professionals working in this specialty are called vascular sonographers. They use ultrasound and other specialized equipment to assess the anatomic, physiologic, and pathologic conditions of veins and arteries. Among the most common studies are those of the carotid arteries, arteries of the upper and lower extremities, abdominal blood vessels, and intracranial circulation. Exploration of these vessels helps to determine the presence of plaques and thrombus, the direction of blood flow, and the process of revascularization, as well as patency of grafts. Vascular sonographers play a very important role in assessing the blood vessels in special situations such as stroke, peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, portal hypertension, and deep vein thrombosis. They even can help to select native vessels for grafts to be used in cardiac surgeries.General and Vascular Sonography Program The NSU General and Vascular Sonography Program in Fort Lauderdale offers didactic and clinical training in the general and vascular sonography subspecialties as one integrated curriculum. At the end of the program, the student will be able to perform general (abdomen, small parts, and neurosonology), obstetrical and gynecological, and vascular studies. The growing use of ultrasound and the need for sonographers with multiple credentials to accommodate new regulations in the health care field have set the ground for a comprehensive program that combines the two main specialties of RDMS (abdomen, ob-gyn, breast, and neuro) and RVT. Bachelor of Health Science\u2014General and Vascular Sonography (B.H.Sc.\u2014GVS) The Bachelor of Health Science with a concentration in General and Vascular Sonography program was designed to prepare entry-level professionals in the fields of general and vascular sonography. During the first year, students take online courses at the undergraduate level, as well as on-campus classes that include many hours each week in the training ultrasound lab. This is followed by a 12-month externship in a clinical site and online courses. Graduates from this program will be able to apply for national examinations with the American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonography (ARDMS) and obtain RDMS and RVT credentials. Upon graduation from the B.H.Sc.\u2014GVS program, students will be eligible to apply for admission to the online Master of Health Science (M.H.Sc.) program. Program Objectives to graduate competent, entry-level diagnostic medical sonographers in the general and vascular specialties who are qualified to perform a variety of standard and specialized diagnostic general and vascular ultrasound examinations to ensure that graduates are qualified to take and successfully pass a national credentialing exam from either the American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonography (ARDMS) or Cardiovascular Credentialing International (CCI) to prepare graduates for future leadership roles in general, vascular, or combined general and vascular laboratories and ultrasound departments to enhance the student's academic skills for pursuing research studies or education in diagnostic medical sonography Upon successful completion of the bachelor's degree-level general and vascular sonography specialization, students are eligible to apply for admission to the Master of Health Science (M.H.Sc.), and later the Doctor of Health Science (D.H.Sc.) programs. Each of these programs is an online College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Department of Health Science 273degree program, with the M.H.Sc. having no residency requirement and the D.H.Sc. having a requirement for students to complete two one-week summer institutes. Curriculum Overview Length of the Program: 27 months The general and vascular sonography program, both at the bachelor's and master's degree levels, includes on-campus lectures; extensive, hands-on training in the ultrasound laboratory; online courses; and a 12-month externship in an accredited clinical facility. The curriculum for this program follows the standards recommended by the American Registry of Diagnostic Sonography (ARDMS) and the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP). Graduating students will earn either a Bachelor of Health Science\u2014General and Vascular Sonography degree or a Master of Health Science\u2014General and Vascular Sonography degree, depending on the program completed. Upon graduation, students will be able to sit for the professional registry exam with the ARDMS and earn RDMS and RVT credentials. The curriculum follows a lock-step model, and the courses must be taken and passed in a predetermined sequence. Examples of the courses in health sciences include: Health Care Ethics, Academic and Professional Writing, Research Methods, and Principles of Management. Some of the core courses for the concentration in general and vascular sonography include: Ultrasound Physics, Abdominal Sonography, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Cerebrovascular Testing, and Peripheral Arterial Testing. In the second year, students have a 12-month externship, allowing them to gain experience through observation and hands-on practice, while being supervised by clinical mentors. Students enrolled in the master's degree program will also participate in a research project mentored by a faculty member to satisfy the internship and practicum course requirements. In the same manner, master's degree students will develop an extensive research project suitable for presentation or publication.

Northwest Highway Park Ridge, Illinois 60068-2573 www.asahq.org Master of Health Science\u2014 Cardiovascular Sonography (On-Campus, Entry-Level, Tampa) Diagnostic medical sonography includes three primary areas of specialization: general, cardiac, and vascular. General sonography includes subspecialties for obstetrics and gynecology exams, exams of the soft tissues and organs of the body, and exams of structures such as joints and tendons. Vascular sonography studies the anatomical and physiological characteristics of all arteries and veins in the body. Cardiac sonography examines the anatomical structure and function of the heart. Cardiovascular technology consists of five areas of specialization: cardiac sonography (adult), cardiac sonography cardiology (angiograms and other catheter- based technology). The demand for all diagnostic medical sonographers and for all cardiovascular specialists is projected to increase, primarily due to the aging of the \"Baby Boom\" generation, as seniors are generally more prone to cardiac and vascular problems. The NSU Cardiovascular Sonography Program in Tampa offers didactic and clinical training in two of these specialties, cardiac sonography (adult) and vascular sonography, as an integrated curriculum. Additional course content introduces the student to pediatric cardiac sonography and basic concepts in electrophysiological cardiology. Because of strong interrelationships between cardiac and vascular diseases, the need was seen for a comprehensive program covering both specialties. Also, some cardiology departments and other imaging providers may prefer that sonographers obtain training and professional registry in both cardiac sonography and vascular sonography for purposes of diagnostic expediency and professional flexibility. The Master of Health Science\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography specialization at Nova Southeastern University is designed to train highly skilled and knowledgeable cardiovascular technologists at a graduate level. Students will take master's degree-level online courses and will develop professor-monitored research projects for publication and/or presentation in their second year. This course of study will prepare graduates for leadership positions in research, clinical management, and education. Program Objectives to offer an advanced-level, professional degree to those already holding a bachelor's-level degree in a health care-related or science field to graduate competent, entry-level cardiovascular technologists who are qualified to perform a variety of standard and specialized diagnostic vascular and cardiac examinations to ensure that graduates are qualified to take and successfully pass at least one sonographic specialty national credentialing exam, in either cardiac or vascular ultrasound, from either the American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonography (ARDMS) or Cardiovascular Credentialing International (CCI) to prepare graduates for future leadership roles in cardiac, vascular, or combined cardiovascular laboratories and ultrasound departments to enhance students' academic skills for pursuing research studies or education in cardiac and vascular sonography Upon successful completion of the master's-degree level cardiovascular sonography specialization, students are eligible to apply for admission to the Doctor of Health Science (D.H.Sc.) program. This is an online degree program with a requirement for students to complete two one-week summer institutes. Curriculum Overview Admission to the master's degree-level program requires the completion of a minimum of 33 semester hours of general education coursework, which may be satisfied within a previously earned bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited institution. The cardiovascular sonography master's degree-level program requires the student to complete 109 semester hours to graduate with a Master of Health Science\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography. College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Department of Health Science 315The cardiovascular sonography program, both at the bachelor's and master's degree levels, includes on-campus lectures; extensive, hands-on training in our ultrasound laboratory; online courses; and a 12-month, focused or combined externship in a clinical laboratory setting. The graduating student will earn either a bachelor's or master's degree in health science with a specialization in cardiovascular sonography, depending on the program completed. Students will take a combination of general courses in the health science field and focused core courses in the cardiovascular technology field. Examples of general courses include Writing for Medical Publication, Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Principles and Practice of Management in Health Care. Examples of cardiovascular sonography courses include Ultrasound Physics, Cardiac Ultrasound, Carotid Artery Duplex, and EKG. While on campus, the student will spend more than 300 hours in the training laboratory learning imaging skills and techniques and physiologic testing methods prior to the clinical externship experience. In the second year, the student will complete a more than 1,800-hour clinical training program while continuing to take online courses. The student may have the option to perform his or her clinical externship in a vascular, adult echo, or combined cardiovascular clinical experience, based upon his or her interests and demonstrated competencies. Upon graduation, the student will be eligible to sit for professional registry exams based upon completion of the program and clinical requirements. Prerequisites In order to be eligible for admission to the Master of Health Science\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography (M.H.Sc.) specialization, a student must have completed 33 semester hours of prerequisite education coursework and have earned a bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited institution with a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale.Required General Education Coursework composition (3 semester hours\u2014above COMP 1000) social and behavioral sciences (9 semester hours) humanities* (6 semester hours) anatomy and physiology I (3 semester hours) physical/human/biological science (6 semester hours) physics (3 semester hours) mathematics** (3 semester hours\u2014above MATH 1000) Total General Education Courses: 33 semester hours*3 semester hours in foreign language recommended **3 semester hours in college algebra strongly recommendedNote: Required general education courses cannot be survey courses.

(3 semester hours)322 College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Department of Health ScienceMaster of Health Science\u2014 General and (On-Campus, Entry-Level) Diagnostic Medical Sonography Diagnostic medical sonography areas of sonography includes subspecialties in obstetrics and gynecology, organs of the body, and small parts (soft tissues and superficial glands), as well as neurosonology. Cardiac sonography examines the anatomical structure and function of the heart and is subdivided into three different subspecialties: adult echocardiography, fetal echocardiography, and pediatric echocardiography. Vascular sonography studies the anatomical and physiological characteristics of blood vessels (veins and arteries) in the human body. The most recently created specialty in sonography is musculoskeletal sonography. This specialty studies the different joints and tendons in the body. Diagnostic medical sonography uses mechanical, nonionizing sound waves to obtain images and is considered a noninvasive modality. General Sonography Professionals in this field are called sonographers or medical sonographers. Sonographers use diagnostic medical ultrasound to obtain images of internal organs such as the liver, gallbladder, bile ducts, pancreas, spleen, appendix, kidneys, and adrenal glands. They also can obtain images from superficial glands and soft tissues. Sonographers specializing in obstetrics and gynecology obtain images of the female pelvic organs and the fetus, while those specializing in neurosonology obtain images of the brain and its blood vessels. Sonographers working in all these specialties determine normal from abnormal situations and contribute to the making of a diagnosis of pathologies affecting those organs.Vascular Sonography Professionals working in this specialty are called vascular sonographers. They use ultrasound and other specialized equipment to assess the anatomic, physiologic, and pathologic conditions of veins and arteries. Among the most common studies are those of the carotid arteries, arteries of the upper and lower extremities, abdominal blood vessels, and intracranial circulation. Exploration of these vessels helps to determine the presence of plaques and thrombus, the direction of blood flow, and the process of revascularization, as well as patency of grafts. Vascular sonographers play a very important role in assessing the blood vessels in special situations such as stroke, peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, portal hypertension, and deep vein thrombosis. They even can help to select native vessels for grafts to be used in cardiac surgeries.General and Vascular Sonography Program The NSU General and Vascular Sonography Program in Fort Lauderdale offers didactic and clinical training in the general and vascular sonography subspecialties as one integrated curriculum. At the end of the program, the student will be able to perform general (abdomen, small parts, and neurosonology), obstetrical and gynecological, and vascular studies. The growing use of ultrasound and the need for sonographers with multiple credentials to accommodate new regulations in the health care field have set the ground for a comprehensive program that combines the two main specialties of RDMS (abdomen, ob-gyn, breast, and neuro) and RVT. During the first year, students take online courses as well as on-campus classes that include many hours each week in the training ultrasound lab. This is followed by a 12-month externship in a clinical site and online courses. Graduates from this program will be able to apply for national examinations with the American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonography (ARDMS) and obtain RDMS and RVT credentials. Upon graduation from the Master of Health Science\u2014GVS program, students will be eligible to apply for admission to the online Doctor of Health Science (D.H.Sc.) program. Master of Health Science\u2014General and Vascular Sonography (M.H.Sc.\u2014GVS) The Master of Health Science\u2014General and Vascular Sonography specialization at Nova Southeastern University is designed to train highly skilled and knowledgeable general and vascular sonographers at a graduate level. Students will take master's degree-level online courses and will develop professor-monitored research projects for publication and/ or presentation in their second year. This course of study will prepare graduates for leadership positions in research, clinical management, and education. Program Objectives to graduate competent diagnostic medical sonographers in the general and vascular specialties who are qualified to perform a variety of standard and specialized diagnostic general and vascular procedures to ensure that graduates are qualified to take, and successfully pass, a national credentialing exam, from either the American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonography (ARDMS) or Cardiovascular Credentialing International (CCI) to prepare master's degree-level graduates for future leadership roles in diagnostic medical ultrasound laboratories (general and/or vascular), research centers, or related professional organizations to develop advanced academic and clinical skills, for pursuing research studies and publication in the field of diagnostic medical general and vascular sonography College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Department of Health Science 323 Physical/Human/Biological Sciences ......................... 6 Physics ........................................................................ 3 Subtotal: 18 semester hours Note: It is preferred, although not required, for the applicant to have completed Anatomy and Physiology II.

(1 semester hour) College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Department of Health Science 337Doctor of Health Science (D.H.Sc.) Program The D.H.Sc. has a two-track curriculum. One is the generalist track. The second is a generalist track with a concentration in global health studies. The generalist D.H.Sc. program requires completion of a minimum of 61 semester hours of coursework. This includes 48 semester hours didactic coursework, 11 semester hours practical coursework, and 2 semester hours for the Doctoral Objective Analysis. The generalist D.H.Sc. program with a concentration in global health studies also consists of 61 semester hours, with the majority of electives and the internship and practicum dedicated to global health topics. The D.H.Sc. program is designed for completion in a distance learning format and requires only minimal on-campus time during two intensive, one-week, summer institute seminar sessions. The residential summer sessions are available at the NSU campuses or student educational centers, with the location varying from year to year. The program curricula are designed to build upon the scientific and general knowledge of the health care professional while focusing on the overall health care picture. Leadership, policy, diversity, evidence-based medical practice, and alternative methods of treatment are but a few of the areas stressed in the generalist curriculum. During the generalist course of study, the student must complete a practicum and internship approved by the D.H.Sc. program director in an area of health care such as leadership, education, policy, or delivery. Students selecting the global health concentration will focus their internship and practicum work in the global health arena. The internship is used to expose the student to an area of health care not commonly experienced in the student's normal area of practice. Though they are two separate portions of the curriculum, the internship may be used as an area of research in preparation for undertaking the practicum. The coursework is professor-paced using state-of-the-art, Web-based delivery. The curriculum and coursework follow a standard 12-week semester calendar in conjunction with resident on-campus programs. At the standard pace established by the program, the course of study can be completed in three years. It is required that all coursework be completed within seven years. Admissions Requirements Prospective D.H.Sc. students are selected by the Committee on Admissions, which considers the overall qualities of applicants and their suitability for this course of study. Areas of consideration include application content, academic record, prior health care experience, letters of evaluation, and personal motivation. In special circumstances, a personal interview with members of the committee on admissions may be required.1. Prior to matriculation, applicants must have completed a master's degree from a regionally accredited college or university. 2. Applicants should demonstrate a cumulative master's degree G.P .A. at or above a 3.0 on a 4.0 scale to be eligible for regular admission. The Committee on Admissions will make a recommendation to the dean of the college as to any remedial coursework necessary for an applicant to achieve full admission. 3. Prior health care experience is required and is strongly considered in the admissions process. The D.H.Sc. is a postprofessional degree designed for health practitioners, public health professionals, and health care administrators from a wide variety of disciplines. The commonality exhibited by our students is the expert practice of a recognized health occupation at a professional level, or five years of administrative experience in a health care organization with progressively increasing responsibilities over that time frame. The successful applicant's health profession may emphasize delivery of services to individual clients (e.g., PA, PT, R.N., LCSW, etc.) or be population based (M.P .H., M.H.A.). An appropriate level of professional practice is generally recognized by health professions licensure (e.g., R.N., PT), a national certification or registration (e.g., PA-C, RVT, RRT, CRNA, FACHE), a recognized M.P .H., M.S.N., M.S.W ., M.H.A., M.B.A.), or a combination of the above. All questions regarding the appropriateness of an applicant's qualifications for admission can be discussed with the department chair or program director on an informal basis, but the official recommendations are made by the Committee on Admi ssions to the dean of the College of Health Care Sciences. The dean makes the final determination. Successful past applicants and graduates have included physicians, dentists, nurses, nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, physician assistants, master's degree-level social workers, physical therapists, occupational therapists, dental hygienists, and athletic trainers. We have recently expanded the program to include health care administrators, and our graduates now include a hospital CEO and an assistant surgeon general of the U.S. Public Health Service. 4. All applicants must show evidence of computer skills through coursework or self study prior to the end of the first term.

Starting winter 2011, students will need to take HSP 9006 only when it is offered in the online format.HPH 7200\u2014Ethics Health care professionals are required to act morally and ethically. This course is designed to expand the student's basic understanding of ethics to promote ethical awareness and enable students to derive better health care decisions that reduce risk of potential ethical consequence. By exposing students to bioethics and controversial ethical issues typically encountered in current health care practice, students are able to practice making difficult decisions. Students will synthesize and implement strategies for applying morals, values, and ethics systematically in the various settings in which health care is delivered. Considering the perspectives of all stakeholders and the role of the health care provider, patient advocate, professional, and consumer of medical care, students will gain workable knowledge of contemporary ethical issues and appreciate that ethics permeate the majority of decisions made in health care. HPH 7300\u2014Biostatistics I The application of quantitative techniques has expanded rapidly in medical decision making. The emphasis on evidence-based health care means that health care workers must be able to evaluate the results from published health care research studies. This course is the first of two courses designed to provide students with the knowledge of quantitative techniques. The course will cover descriptive statistics, parametric group comparison statistics, and basic nonparametric statistics and provide an introduction to linear modeling.350 College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Department of Health ScienceHPH 7310\u2014Biostatistics II The aim of this course is to enable students to appreciate the richness of statistical science and to invite them to the concept of probabilistic thinking. Statistics is the science of the future. Any technique that students are going to learn will help them to understand the unknown better, and in turn, will increase their success in other courses and in future professional careers. Principles of statistical inference build upon the course Fundamentals of Biostatistics. As such, a prerequisite for enrolling in this course is satisfactory completion of Fundamentals of Biostatistics. The goals of this course are threefold: (1) introduce the basic concepts of probability as well as methods for calculating the probability of an event; (2) assist students in developing an understanding of probability theory and sampling distributions; and (3) familiarize students about inferences involving one or two populations, ANOVA, regression analysis, and chi-square tests. HPH 7400\u2014Research Design This course will provide students with a fundamental understanding of the basic methods and approaches used in health care research. A major emphasis of the course will be on the conceptualization and design of research studies. The course will cover ethics, formulation of research questions, study design, reliability, validity, sampling, measurement, and interpretation of research findings. It will prepare students to critically evaluate published literature, and to design sound research studies. The course will be both theoretical and applied. Students will be challenged to apply the theoretical concepts presented in the classroom and in the readings to design a study to address a health-related issue of their choice. HPH 7410\u2014Qualitative Research Design This course will focus primarily on the knowledge and skill competencies needed to conduct qualitative research successfully. In this pursuit, students will immerse themselves in the epistemological, theoretical, ethical, methodological, and procedural understanding of qualitative research; apply this knowledge to the conceptualization and conduct of qualitative research; report the findings of the research in the form of a research article; and appraise the quality of such qualitative research products. Upon completion of the course, students will demonstrate that they have mastered the basic competencies needed to create, plan, and complete a qualitative research dissertation. HPH 7500\u2014Philosophy of Science This course covers schools of thought in the philosophy of science. To address the need of laying the foundation for the generation and expansion of new professional knowledge that will guide evidence-based practice for the health professions, this course also covers topics on the acceptance of theories in the scientific community and epistemology of applied scientific inquiry. This course is designed to allow Ph.D. students in the health professions to gain appreciation for the philosophical underpinnings of unity in science, to be able to apply philosophical frameworks and epistemological paradigms in their future research, and to, eventually, become creative researchers in their areas of practice. HPH 7600\u2014Grant Writing and Publication This course enables students to gain an in-depth understanding of the essential components of a well- written research proposal that addressees an identified scientific problem and the process for submitting the proposal to an agency/organization to request funding support to study the problem. Students will become familiar with a number of funding sources (including federal and state governments, private foundations, and corporations that support vision or dental research projects) and learn to use a variety of resources to target potential funding sources. Students will also become familiar with grant- related terminology, as well as guidelines, rules, and regulations of awarding agencies, with particular focus on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) organization. HSP 9007\u2014Research Practicum Research Practicum requires students to conduct a research activity under faculty member supervision. Objectives include developing the ability to critically review literature, abstract salient points from literature and present them cogently, summarize conceptual and methodological issues in the literature, formulate a research problem derived from the literature, derive research hypotheses from research questions, develop a research methodology, test stated hypotheses, implement research methodology, analyze and interpret data, and write research in APA style. HSP 9010\u2014Research Practicum Continued Students who do not complete HSP 9007 in the required 16 weeks must enroll in HSP 9010. A charge of 2 credits for continuing service will be made to maintain the student's full-time status in the Ph.D. program. Students' progress through Research Practicum Continued will increase their total number of degree credits beyond the required 75. Students who do not successfully complete HSP 9010 in one semester may be dismissed from the program. HSP 9008\u2014Comprehensive Exam The comprehensive examination is a written examination that students take after the completion of all the required Ph.D. in Health Science coursework and before beginning the dissertation phase of the Ph.D. program. It is designed to evaluate a student's ability to demonstrate that he or she is a suitable candidate for a Ph.D. degree. Successful completion of the comprehensive examination is required for students to move to advanced standing and begin dissertation research. College of Health Care Sciences \u2014Department of Health Science 351The comprehensive examination is given two times per academic year, during the summer and winter semesters, and takes place on the Nova Southeastern University main campus in the greater Fort Lauderdale, Florida, area. Students register with the Department of Health Science prior to attending one of the institutes to take the comprehensive exam and receive an examination number. Students who register for the comprehensive examination certify by this action that they are prepared to take the exam. However, participating in the comprehensive examination preparatory training does not mean that students will pass the comprehensive examination. Students can withdraw from the comprehensive examination without a reason up to 10 days before the exam. Once this time has passed, students with circumstances beyond their control (such as sickness, car accident, family illness or other extenuating circumstances), must notify the Ph.D. program director at the earliest possible time and provide documentation to support their need to withdraw from the exam. Students who have obtained approval from the Ph.D. program director to withdraw from the comprehensive examination will be allowed to take the comprehensive examination at the next scheduled offering. Students who registered for the comprehensive examination and do not show, or students who do not contact the program director requesting to be excused from the examination, will automatically fail the comprehensive examination. Students who have failed the comprehensive exam are referred to the Department of Health Science Committee for Student Progress (CSP) for possible dismissal from the Ph.D. program. The CSP then makes recommendations to the department chair. The department chair notifies the student of the decision by certified mail (return receipt requested) and by email with response requested. Students have the right to appeal the decision of dismissal from the Ph.D. program to the College of Health Care Sciences Appeals Committee within five business days of notification from the chair of their department. The grading of the comprehensive examination is on a Pass/Fail basis. Students are only allowed to take the complete comprehensive exam once and must pass all three categories to move forward to the dissertation phase of the Ph.D. program. Students are notified of their results on the comprehensive examination by certified mail and copies of the letters are sent to students' NSU email accounts. Following the successful completion of the comprehensive examination, students can register for dissertation credits and begin the dissertation process. Students who pass two of the three categories may retake the one failed category at the next scheduled examination date. Students have one opportunity to pass the failed category. Students who wish to dispute their grades must contact the Ph.D. program director, as there is no direct communication between graders and students. The program director will interact directly with the faculty member who graded the exams and inform the student of the grader's comments. The grade dispute ends at the program director level. Failure to pass the comprehensive examination may result in dismissal from the program, irrespective of students' performance in other aspects of doctoral study. Students who do not pass two, or all three, categories have failed the comprehensive exam and are referred to the Department of Health Science Committee for Student Progress Students are strongly encouraged to familiarize themselves with the academic standards and the academic honesty policy and procedure as described in the College of Health Care Sciences Student dissertation is scheduled as six courses over two years. This includes the dissertation preparation seminar, proposal, dissertation, and oral defense. Students will conduct original research in an area of the student's expertise or concentration, as approved by the program chair and dissertation committee, and have verification of presentation or publication. The dissertation will culminate with an oral final defense, which will occur in person at the summer or winter institute, or on the main campus. The oral defense must be arranged at least 45 days in advance. Process and requirements are detailed in the Health Professions Division Dissertation Guide. HSP 9017\u2014 Dissertation Continuation For any additional semester after the initial six courses, students will register for a dissertation continuation course with a continuing service charge to maintain the students' full-time enrollment. At the end of each semester, students who demonstrate forward progress on their dissertation will earn a PR (in progress) grade. Students who do not demonstrate forward progress will earn an NPR (not in progress) grade. Students who earn an NPR grade in any dissertation course may register for the next semester, although they may not be eligible for federal funds. Students' progress through dissertation continuation may increase their total number of degree credits beyond the required 75. On-Campus Institutes These one-week sessions are located either at the Health Professions Division complex on NSU's main campus in Fort Lauderdale, Florida; the NSU Student Educational Center in Orlando, Florida; or the NSU Student Educational Center in Tampa, Florida. Three such institutes are required to complete the Ph.D. degree. Starting winter 2011, students will need to take HSP 9006 only when it is offered in the online format. DHS 8080 and DHS 8170 will be offered as summer institutes. HSP 9007 will be offered as a winter institute.College of Medical Sciences College of Medical Sciences 355Mission Statement The mission of the College of Medical Sciences is to train students in the basic medical sciences and to prepare them for careers in health care and higher education.
