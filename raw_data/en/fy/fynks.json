The growth can be attributed to the advancements in active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturing and the rising prevalence of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Favorable government policies for API production, along with changes in geopolitical situations, are boosting market growth. The API market is undergoing immense changes due to supply chain disruption by COVID-19. Countries such as India are being preferred over China for the export of API owing to geopolitical situations and the demand to reduce dependence on China for API products. Furthermore, governments of many countries have formulated plans and granted incentives to promote the production of API. The COVID-19 pandemic had a positive impact on the global APIs market. The pharmaceutical industry was an epicenter in treating symptoms related to COVID-19, including high fever, cough, and cold. Due to the increased popularity of the pharma industry during the pandemic, the active pharmaceutical ingredients market also witnessed growth during the period. Following the World Health Organization's declaration of the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic, a diverse group of renowned pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies, as well as new startups, stepped forward to create therapies to combat the virus. Scientists discovered a list of compounds that target COVID-19. Currently, there are approximately 155 compounds in clinical trials and 45 molecules in preclinical development to combat COVID-19. Four vaccines have been repurposed for treatment against COVID-19, including Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir & Ritonavir, and Remdesivir. In March 2020, WHO started a worldwide trial of the four COVID-19 medicines. Increased investment and research and development in pharmaceutical products will propel the growth of the market further. However, the coronavirus outbreak has caused global business and economic disruption. It is expected to have a short-term impact on the active pharmaceutical ingredients industry in the first quarter of 2020. The global geriatric population is rising. According to the UN, in 2018, the population aged 65 and above is anticipated to increase from 962 million in 2018 to 2.1 billion by 2050. Aging weakens the immune system and increases a patient's susceptibility to acquiring infectious diseases. Moreover, impairment in body functions enhances the chances of getting other diseases, such as CVD and diabetes. The requirement of high capital for the production of APIs is because the process needs extremely systematic protocols, which results in the outsourcing of various APIs. In addition, pharmaceutical companies benefit from API production outsourcing as it eradicates the need for expensive manufacturing unit installation and labor force. Thus, the need for cost savings boosts outsourcing. Strategic outsourcing by companies allows them to focus on core competencies, which results in increased productivity. HPAPIs (highly potent active pharmaceutical ingredients) indicate a dramatic shift in how pharmaceutical companies use small molecules to offer new medicines. As a result of the change to HPAPIs, a pipeline of more effective drugs with lower doses has emerged. HPAPIs' advantages, including the requirement for a lower therapeutic dose, capacity to bind to specific receptors, and high efficiency, can be attributed to their rising demand among producers and customers. The API market has always been dominated by small molecules. API manufacturers are adopting HPAPIs to differentiate themselves from the competition as the generic API industry becomes increasingly competitive. In addition, APIs are used as Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs). ADCs are important and effective treatment modalities used in combination with biologically active drugs and [monoclonal antibodies](/industry-analysis/monoclonal-antibodies-market) for cancer. APIs effectively target cancer cells while causing minimum exposure of drugs to healthy tissues. Thus, the development of cancer-specific APIs is expected to boost the API market growth. The captive API segment accounted for the largest revenue share of 51.5% in 2022. It is anticipated to grow at a significant rate in the upcoming years owing to the easy availability of raw materials and extensive investments by major players to develop high-end manufacturing facilities. Furthermore, recent developments and initiatives by key players suggest that they are highly focused on in-house manufacturing over outsourcing. For instance, in November 2019, Novartis announced the acquisition of CellforCure-a France-based CDMO-for producing molecules in-house, which was earlier contracted to CellforCure. These initiatives undertaken by key players are anticipated to boost segment growth. Major companies are looking to leverage their production capabilities in Asian countries in an attempt to provide APIs to other drugmakers. Apart from major players Government of India has also planned to provide impetus to domestic API manufacturing. For instance, in March 2020, the government of India announced a 9.4 billion package for the bulk drug industry, which will give a boost to domestic production and exports. Top biopharmaceutical players are responsible for substantial growth in the outsourcing segment. Furthermore, the lower cost of manufacturing in countries such as India and China makes them a popular choice for players looking to outsource their API production. Outsourcing manufacturing to developing countries is a cost-effective measure that allows these companies to gain higher profits, thus accelerating segment growth. Innovative APIs held the largest share of 47.07% in 2022. This growth is attributed to increasing R&D initiatives for novel drug development and favorable government regulations. As a result of extensive research in this field, several innovative products are now in development and are expected to launch in the forecast period. New entrants in this segment are expected to drive market growth. A rise in demand for targeted therapies with high potency API compounds, such as HPAPI, is anticipated to increase the demand for personalized medicines. For instance, ADCs leverage the specificity of antibodies for cancer cells. These cells use linker technology to attach themselves to the antibody. These advanced features of ADCs are anticipated to drive the market, with most pharmaceutical companies pursuing such development programs. The patent expiry of branded molecules is a key factor that can be attributed to the lucrative growth of generic API drugs. The generic drug market is anticipated to exhibit a high growth rate in countries such as Brazil and India, owing to high unmet clinical needs and acceptance of OTC drugs. The cardiovascular diseases segment accounted for the largest revenue share of 21.54% in 2022. This is attributed to the increasing prevalence of target diseases worldwide. Various organizations such as the World Heart Federation, the World Stroke Organization, and the Stroke Association are working toward increasing awareness about cardiovascular diseases. Government initiatives such as the National Cholesterol Education Program are aimed at improving awareness related to lipid and cholesterol-related diseases. High prevalence and increasing awareness about cardiovascular diseases are anticipated to drive the segment during the forecast period, thus driving demand for APIs for cardiology drugs. The oncology segment is anticipated to witness significant growth of 7.6% during the forecast period. Factors such as changing lifestyles and the growing prevalence of cancer are driving the market.
