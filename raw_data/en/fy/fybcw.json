Health Community 4Baylor Scott & White Health mission Our commitment to the communities we serve As the largest not-for-profit healthcare system in T exas and one of the largest in the United States, Baylor Scott & White Health was born from the 2013 combination of Baylor Health Care System and Scott & White Healthcare. T oday, Baylor Scott & White includes 51 hospitals, 1,100 access points, more than 7,300 active physicians, and over 49,000 employees and the Baylor Scott & White Health Plan. Baylor Scott & White Health is a leading T exas healthcare provider with a proven commitment to patient and community health. Baylor Scott & White Health demonstrates this commitment through periodic community health needs assessments, then addresses those needs with a wide range of outreach initiatives. These Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) activities also satisfy federal and state community benefit requirements outlined in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the T exas Health and Safety Code. Baylor Scott & White Health conducts a thorough periodic examination of public health indicators and a benchmark analysis comparing communities it serves to an overall state of T exas value. In this way, it can determine where deficiencies lie and the opportunities for improvement are greatest. Through interviews, focus groups and surveys, the organization gains a clearer understanding of community needs from the perspective of the members of each community. This helps it identify the most pressing needs a community is facing and develop implementation plans to focus on those prioritized needs. The process includes input from a wide range of knowledgeable people who represent the myriad interests of the community in compliance with 501 (r)(3) regulations. The CHNA process overview can be found in Appendix A. The CHNAs serve as the foundation for community health improvement planning efforts over the next three years, while the implementation plans will be evaluated annually.Health Experience Affordability Alignment GrowthFounded as a Christian ministry of healing, Baylor Scott & White Health promotes the well-being of all individuals, families and communities.

They identified an opportunity to increase community awareness of services available through programs and informational campaigns, especially around mental health services. This will be important as they pointed out that future mental health patients will increase both in number and severity due to their needs being underserved during COVID. In the prioritization session, the hospital and community leaders were in agreement that mental health is a huge issue in America and this community. Current local systems are challenged to keep up with the influx of mental health patients. Lake Pointe Health Community 10Priority 2: Access to Primary Healthcare There is a greater need for access for the population to one non-physician primary care provider. The key informants also noted that there is a need in the area of population to one primary care physician. Category Data shows greater need Key informants indicate greater need Access to care Population to one non-physician primary care provider More social workers and care navigators need to be added to community The data below indicates greater need for access for the population to one non-physician primary care provider.

High demand for primary care and a limited number of primary care providers lead to difficulty accessing primary services. Access is especially limited in rural areas. The hospital and community leaders discussed issues regarding access to care and recognized a great need to expand social workers and navigators in partnership with the Baylor Scott & White Quality Alliance. Lake Pointe Health Community 12Priority 3: Utilization/Emergency Department Use A greater need was identified in the area of Medicare population and their emergency department use rate. Category Data shows greater need Key informants indicate greater need Utilization Medicare population: emergency department use rate Disconnect for seniors on instructions for care after emergency services The Medicare population: emergency department use rate indicator is defined as the unique patients having an emergency department visit divided by the total beneficiaries and is based on data from CMS Outpatient 100% Standard Analytical File (SAF) and CMS Standard Analytical Files (SAF) Denominator File.

Color and shape compare county performance to the state benchmark; orange diamonds show greater need and blue circles lesser need. Greater or lesser need than state greater need same level of need or NA lesser need The key informants of the focus group recognized that emergency utilization is high and attributed it to the lack of after-hours physician office appointments. The hospital and community leaders agreed that the overuse of the emergency department is an issue. They explained that a lack of post-discharge instructions contributes to the problem, as does the lack of accessibility to primary care physicians who accept Medicare patients. Lake Pointe Health Community 13Priority 4: Opioid Involved Accidental Poisoning Death A greater need was identified in the area of opioid involved accidental poisoning death. Category Data shows greater need Key informants indicate greater need Mental health conditions/ diseases Opioid involved accidental poisoning death Negative life habits (smoking, drinking, etc.) The opioid involved accidental poisoning death indicator is defined as the annual estimates of the resident population accidental poisoning deaths where opioids were involved divided by 100,000 population and is based on data from US Census Bureau, Population Division and T exas Health and Human Services Center for Health Statistics Opioid related deaths in T exas.

Color and shape compare county performance to the state benchmark; orange diamonds show greater need and blue circles lesser need. Greater or lesser need than state greater need same level of need or NA lesser need The key informants of the focus group noted that the community has seen a rise in substance abuse. Unfortunately, they recognize that there are gaps in substance abuse services, and therefore, these patients have nowhere to seek help to avoid accidental poisoning deaths. They cited limited providers and insufficient accessible hours. They also noted a lack of a substance abuse treatment center for diversion under T exas Code of Criminal Procedure Art. 16.23. In the prioritization session, the hospital and community leaders were in agreement that substance abuse is another huge issue in America and this community. They explained that the Rowlett Police Department is often the first to respond to community members experiencing substance abuse issues. Citizens experiencing these issues are arrested and put into the jail system since there is no access to a substance abuse facility within the city of Rowlett. Lake Pointe Health Community 14Priority 5: Transportation Although the data did not illustrate a need, the focus group participants indicated the importance of prioritizing transportation needs especially in rural areas. Category Data shows less need or no data Key informants indicate greater need Environment (Transportation) No vehicle available Transportation is a challenge, especially in rural areas The no vehicle available measure is defined as the percent of households with no vehicle available. The indicator is based on data from US Census Bureau, American Community Survey One-Year Estimates.

Indicators are ranked from 1 to 59, where low numbers show higher need and potentially larger vulnerable population relative to the state benchmark. Color and shape compare county performance to the state benchmark; orange diamonds show greater need and blue circles lesser need. Greater or lesser need than state greater need same level of need or NA lesser need According to key informants, transportation is a top health barrier across the community. Even though there are programs in place to assist in transporting the population, such as the Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART), public transportation is cost-prohibitive, and logistics are difficult and must be planned in advance. Public transportation and current voucher programs are still inefficient in getting residents to their healthcare appointments, and more needs to be done. Transportation is especially challenging in rural areas. In the prioritization session, the hospital and community leaders agreed that transportation is a top barrier for patients and community members. They noted that Rockwall has limited taxi services, and community members often call EMS for non-emergent issues. Lake Pointe Health Community 15Priority 6: Drug Poisoning Deaths The following data indicates greater need in the area of drug poisoning deaths. Category Data shows greater need Key informants indicate greater need Health behaviors Drug poisoning deaths Negative life habits (smoking, drinking, etc.) The drug poisoning deaths indicator is defined as the number of drug poisoning deaths (drug overdose deaths) per 100,000 population.

Color and shape compare county performance to the state benchmark; orange diamonds show greater need and blue circles lesser need. Greater or lesser need than state greater need same level of need or NA lesser need The key informants of the focus group noted that the community has seen a rise in substance abuse. Just as noted earlier in the case of opioid accidental deaths, they recognize that there are gaps in substance abuse services, and therefore, these patients do not have a resource to seek help. They cited limited providers and insufficient accessible hours. They also noted a lack of a substance abuse treatment center for diversions under T exas Code of Criminal Procedure Art. 16.23. In the prioritization session, the hospital and community leaders were in agreement that substance abuse is another huge issue in American and this community.

Greater or lesser need than state greater need same level of need or NA lesser need The focus group participants cited that residents of the community exhibit low involvement in healthy exercise options and outdoor exercise. There is also a lack of information in the community to increase their knowledge about healthy exercise habits and healthy diet. In the prioritization session, the hospital and community leaders did not provide further insight on physically unhealthy days. Lake Pointe Health Community 17Priority 8: Physical Inactivity/Low Exercise The following data indicates greater need in the area of physical inactivity. Category Data shows greater need Key informants indicate greater need Health behaviors Physical inactivity Low involvement in healthy exercise options/outdoor exercise The indicator physical inactivity is defined as the percentage of adults ages 20 and over reporting no leisure-time physical activity in the past month.

CHNA process BSWH began the 2022 CHNA process in April of 2021. The following is an overview of the timeline and major milestones: Define the community Assess the community Identify \"significant needs\" and \"prioritize\" Document in written report CHNA board approvals Make CHNA widely available on website Written implementation strategy Implementation strategy board approval Make implementation strategy widely available on website Act on strategy, measure and report Lake Pointe Health Community 22Consultant qualifications IBM Watson Health delivers analytic tools, benchmarks and strategic consulting services to the healthcare industry, combining rich data analytics in demographics, including the Community Needs Index, planning and disease prevalence estimates, with experienced strategic consultants to deliver comprehensive and actionable Community Health Needs Assessments. Health needs assessment process overview T o identify the health needs of the community, the hospitals established a comprehensive method using all available relevant data including community input. They used the qualitative and quantitative data obtained when assessing the community to identify its community health needs. Surveyors conducted interviews and focus groups with individuals representing public health, community leaders/groups, public organizations and other providers. In addition, data collected from public sources compared to the state benchmark indicated the level of severity. The outcomes of the quantitative data analysis were compared to the qualitative data findings. These data are available to the community via an interactive dashboard at BSWHealth.com/ CommunityNeeds. Data gathering: quantitative assessment of health needs - methodology and data sources The IBM team used quantitative data collection and analysis garnered from public health indicators to assess community health needs. This included over 100 data elements grouped into over 11 categories evaluated for the counties where data was available. Recently, indicators expanded to include new categories addressing mental health, healthcare costs, opioids and social determinants of health. A table depicting the categories and indicators and a list of sources are in Appendix B. A benchmark analysis of each indicator determined which public health indicators demonstrated a community health need. Benchmark health indicators included overall US values, state of T exas values and other goal-setting benchmarks, such as Healthy People 2020. According to America's Health Rankings 2021 Annual Report, T exas ranks 22nd out of the 50 states in the area of Health Outcomes (which includes behavioral health, mortality and physical health) and 50th in the area of Clinical Care (which includes avoiding care due to cost, providers per 100,000 population and preventive services). When the health status of T exas was compared to other states, the team identified many opportunities to impact community health. Lake Pointe Health Community 23The quantitative analysis of the health community used the following methodology: The team set benchmarks for each health community using state value for comparison. They identified community indicators not meeting state benchmarks. From this, they determined a need differential analysis of the indicators, which helped them understand the community's relative severity of need. Using the need differentials, they established a standardized way to evaluate the degree that each indicator differed from its benchmark. This quantitative analysis showed which health community indicators were above the 25th percentile in order of severity\u2014and which health indicators needed their focus. The outcomes of the quantitative data analysis were compared to the qualitative data findings. Information gaps In some areas of T exas, the small population size has an impact on reporting and statistical significance. The team has attempted to understand the most significant health needs of the entire community. It is understood that there is variation of need within the community, and BSWH may not be able to impact all of the population who truly need the service. Community input: qualitative health needs assessment - approach T o obtain a qualitative assessment of the health community, the team: Assembled a focus group representing the broad interests of the community served; Conducted interviews and surveys with key informants\u2014leaders and representatives who serve the community and have insight into its needs; and Held prioritization sessions with hospital clinical leadership and community leaders to review collection results and identify the most significant healthcare needs based on information gleaned from the focus groups and key informants. Focus groups helped identify barriers and social factors influencing the community's health needs. Key informant interviews gave the team even more understanding and insight about the general health status of the community and the various drivers that contributed to health issues. Multiple governmental public health department individuals were asked to contribute their knowledge, information and expertise relevant to the health needs of the community. Individuals or organizations who served and/or represented the interests of medically underserved, low-income and minority populations in the community also took part in the process. NOTE: In some cases, public health officials were unavailable due to obligations concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. The hospitals also considered written input received on their most recently conducted CHNA and subsequent implementation strategies if provided. The assessment is available for public comment or feedback on the report findings by going to the BSWH website (BSWHealth.com/CommunityNeeds) or by emailing CommunityHealth@BSWHealth.org. Lake Pointe Health Community 24Approach to prioritizing significant health needs On December 13, 2021, a session was conducted with key leadership members from Baylor Scott & White along with community leaders to review the qualitative and quantitative data findings of the CHNA to date, discuss at length the significant needs identified, and complete prioritization exercises to rank the community needs. Prioritizing health needs was a two-step process. The two-step process allowed participants to consider the quantitative needs and qualitative needs as defined by the indicator dataset and focus group/interview/survey participant input. In the first step, participants reviewed the top health needs for their community using associated data-driven criteria. The criteria included health indicator value(s) for the community and how the indicator compared to the state benchmark. High data/ Low qualitativeHigh data/ High qualitative TIVE QUALIT A TIVEDATAHigh data and high qualitative: The community indicators that showed a greater need in the health community overall when compared to the state of T exas comparative benchmark and were identified as a greater need by the key informants. High data/ Low qualitativeHigh data/ High qualitative TIVE QUALIT A TIVEDATAHigh data and low qualitative: The community indicators showed a greater need in the health community overall when compared to the state of T exas comparative benchmark but were not identified as a greater need or not specifically identified by the key informants. High data/ Low qualitativeHigh data/ High qualitative TIVE QUALIT A TIVEDATALow/no data and high qualitative: The community indicators showed less need or had no data available in the health community overall when compared to the state of T exas comparative benchmark but were identified as a greater need by the key informants. Participants held a group discussion about which needs were most significant, using the professional experience and community knowledge of the group. A virtual voting method was invoked for individuals to provide independent opinions. This process helped the group define and identify the community's significant health needs. Participants voted individually for the needs they considered the most significant for this community. When the votes were tallied, the top identified needs emerged and were ranked based on the number of votes. High data/Low qualitative High data/High qualitative Data compared to state benchmark indicates need by a greater magnitude BUT T opic was not raised in interviews and focus groupsData compared to state benchmark indicates need by a greater magnitude AND T opic was a frequent theme in interviews and focus groups Data compared to state benchmark indicates need by a lesser magnitude AND T opic was not raised in interviews and focus groupsData compared to state benchmark indicates need by a lesser magnitude BUT T opic was a frequent theme in interviews and focus groups Low data/Low qualitative Low/no data/High qualitative High data = Indicators worse than state benchmark by greater magnitude High qualitative = Frequency of topic in interviews and focus groupsQualitative QualitativeData Data Lake Pointe Health Community 25Prioritization of significant needs In the second step, participants ranked the significant health needs based on prioritization criteria recommended by the focus group conducted for this community: Severity (outcome if ignored): The problem results in disability or premature death or creates burdens on the community, economically or socially. Root cause: The need is a root cause of other problems. If addressed, it could possibly impact multiple issues. Feasibility/cost: Is the problem amenable to interventions? What technology, knowledge or resources are necessary to effect a change? Is the problem preventable? Is it too expensive for the community to tackle? Social justice: Is the problem more concentrated to a specific vulnerable population? Does addressing this issue lead to unfair social benefit? Are we equitable to all vulnerable populations in our approach? The group rated each of the eight significant health needs on each of the four identified criteria, using a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high). The criteria score sums for each need created an overall score. They prioritized the list of significant health needs based on the overall scores. The outcome of this process was the list of prioritized health needs for this community. Priority Need Category of need 1 Mentally unhealthy days Mental health 2 Access to primary healthcare Access to care 3 Utilization/emergency department use Utilization 4 Opioid involved accidental poisoning death Mental health conditions/ diseases 5 Transportation Environment (transportation) 6 Drug poisoning deaths Health behaviors 7 Number of unhealthy days Health status 8 Physical inactivity/low exercise Health behaviors Lake Pointe Health Community 26Appendix B: key public health indicators IBM Watson Health collected and analyzed fifty-nine (59) public health indicators to assess and evaluate community health needs. For each health indicator, a comparison between the most recently available community data and benchmarks for the same/similar indicator was made.

The CNI takes into account vital socio- economic factors, including income, culture, education, insurance and housing, about a community to generate a CNI score for every population ZIP code in the US. The CNI is strongly linked to variations in community healthcare needs and is a good indicator of a community's demand for a range of healthcare services. Not-for-profit and community-based hospitals, for whom community need is central to the mission of service, are often challenged to prioritize and effectively distribute hospital resources. The CNI can be used to help them identify specific initiatives best designed to address the health disparities of a given community. The CNI score by ZIP code shows specific areas within a community where healthcare needs may be greater. Lake Pointe Health Community The overall CNI score for the Lake Pointe Health Community was 3.74. The difference in the numbers indicates both a strong link to community healthcare needs and a community's demand for various healthcare services. In portions of the community, the CNI score was greater than 4.5, indicating more significant health needs among the population.Composite CNI score 3.74 T exas CNI score 3.85 US composite CNI score 3.00 Barrier State US Income 3.0 3.0 Culture 4.7 3.0 Education 3.5 3.0 Insurance 4.3 3.0 Housing 3.9 3.0Composite CNI: high scores indicate high need. ZIP map where color shows the 2020 Community Need Index on a scale of 1 to 5. Orange color indicates high need areas (CNI = 4 or 5); blue color indicates low need (CNI = 1 or 2). Gray colors have needs at the national average (CNI = 3).\u00a92022 Mapbox \u00a9OpenStreetMap 1.000 5.000 Lake Pointe Health 40Appendix E: proprietary community data IBM Watson Health supplemented the publicly available data with estimates of localized inpatient demand discharges, outpatient procedures, emergency department visits, heart disease, as well as cancer incidence estimates. Social determinants of health are the structural determinants and conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age. All of which can greatly impact healthcare utilization and play a major role in the shifting healthcare landscape. Social determinants, such as education, income and race, are factored into Inpatient Demand Estimates and Outpatient Procedure Estimates utilization rate creation methodologies. Inpatient demand estimates Inpatient demand estimates provide the total volume of annual acute care admissions by ZIP code and DRG Product Line for every market in the United States. IBM uses all-payor state discharge data for publicly available states and Medicare (MEDPAR) data for the entire US. These rates are applied to demographic projections by ZIP code to estimate inpatient utilization for 2020 through 2030. The following summary is reflective of the inpatient utilization trends for Lake Pointe Health Community. T otal discharges in the community are expected to grow by about 10% by 2030, with pulmonary medical, general medicine and cardiovascular diseases projecting the largest growth.

Procedures are defined and reported by procedure codes and are further grouped into clinical service lines. The Lake Pointe Health Community outpatient procedures are expected to increase by 34.5% by 2030 with the largest growth in the categories of labs, general & internal medicine, physical & occupational therapy, psychiatry and hematology & oncology.

IBM uses an extensive supply of proprietary claims, public claims and federal surveys to construct population-based use rates for all payors by age and sex. These use rates are then applied to demographic and insurance coverage projections by ZIP code to estimate ED utilization for 2020 through 2030. Visits are broken out into emergent and non-emergent ambulatory visits to identify the volume of visits that could be seen in a less-acute setting, for example, a fast-track ED or an urgent care facility. In addition, visits which result in an inpatient admission are broken out into a third, separate category. In the Lake Pointe Health Community, ED visits are expected to grow by over 14% by 2025.

IBM uses public and private claims data as well as epidemiological data from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) to build local estimates of heart disease prevalence for the current population. County-level models by age and sex are applied to the underlying demographics of specific geographies to estimate the number of patients with specific types of heart disease. In Lake Pointe Health Community, the most common heart disease is hypertension at 73.2% of all heart disease cases.
