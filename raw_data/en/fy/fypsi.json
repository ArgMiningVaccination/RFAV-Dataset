While the world accepts the allopathic medicine system as the modern medicine system, it is a fact that, in different civilizations, there remains traditional concepts of medicine that are based on natural remedies such as herbs and plant juices. Homeopathy is one system of medicine that is an alternative to allopath and popular all over the world. Ayurved evolved with ancient Indian civilization thousands of years ago. However, homeopathy is a recent phenomenon having been discovered only three centuries ago. Despite many similarities such as being alternative systems of medicines that are close to nature there are many differences in the two medicine systems that will be highlighted in this article. Ayurveda Ayurveda is a Sanskrit word that comes from Ayur meaning life and Veda meaning knowledge. So Ayurvedic means science of life and is an integrated and holistic system of treatment, rather a way of life that takes mankind closer to nature and opens the doors to a healthy and long life. It includes many therapies for the prevention and treatment of diseases. Ayurved originated in India thousands of years ago, but today it is practiced in many Southeast Asian countries. Lord Dhanwantari, and later physicians like Charak and Sushruta are credited with the writings in this old system of medicine. The basic concept of Ayurveda revolves around a delicate balance of vata, pita, and cough or wind, bile, and phlegm. Whenever this balance is thrown out of gear, diseases or disorders surface that need to be treated. Homoeopathy Homoeopathy is an alternative system of medicine that is holistic in nature, and it is based upon natural remedies. It was developed in the late 18th century by Samuel Hahnemann in Germany. The word homeopathy is made from homeo meaning similar and pathy meaning science. There is a principle called similia simillibus currentaer in homeopathy which says that similar medicines treat similar diseases or disorders. The remedies in homeopathy are made from extracts of flowers, plants, and animal sources that are diluted in alcohol. Homoeopathy believes that there is a vital force inside the body that is affected by several external and internal factors. The twin principles of similar and dilution form the basis of medicines in homoeopathy and the practitioner prescribes medicines on the basis of symptoms of the patient. What is the difference between Ayurvedic and Homeopathy? Ayurved originated in India three thousand years ago while homeopathy was founded in Germany by Samuel Hahnemann in late 18th century. While both are alternative systems of medicines and make use of natural remedies, the imbalance between wind, bile, and phlegm forms the basis of Ayurved whereas factors affecting vital force inside the body forms the basis of homeopathy. Principle of dilution rules supreme in homeopathy, where active ingredients are dilutes in alcohol. On the other hand, herbal products, in addition to minerals like gold, lead, copper etc., are mostly used in Ayurved to treat disorders. External therapies are very common in Ayurved and meditation and exercise are parts of this ancient system of life. On the other hand, homeopathy is dependent upon its medicines alone. The use of external therapies like panchakarma for treatment of diseases makes Ayurved different from homeopathy. Homeopathic medicines are considered safe and free from any side effects while there have been cases of side effects reported by the administration of Ayurvedic medicines. Ayurved believes in removing toxins from the body and maintaining the balance of vata, pitta, and kapha as ways to keep individuals healthy whereas homoeopathy believes that diseases are already there inside our bodies and not contacted.
