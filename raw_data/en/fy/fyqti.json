This treatment works to remove any bacteria, toxins and tartar located in pockets between the tooth roots and the gums. To make a deep cleaning as comfortable as possible for our patients, [our experienced periodontists](https://periodontalhealthcenter.com/About-Periodontal-Health-Center/) use a local anesthetic in the mouth, and we can administer laughing gas if needed! After this procedure, you may feel some soreness or tenderness in your gums. This should go away within a few days, once your newly cleaned gums have healed. During your healing stage, it's important that you support your gums and care for them properly to promote a quick and healthy recovery. As you can imagine, caring for your gums has everything to do with the food you eat! Here's what you need to know about eating after a deep periodontal cleaning: How long after a deep cleaning can you eat? After the deep cleaning procedure, when your mouth is still numb and the local anesthetic and (optional) laughing gas is wearing off, it's important that you refrain from eating. Eating while numb can increase the chances of you biting your cheeks or tongue and disrupting the healing process. Once the numbness wears off and you can feel your tongue and lips again, you can eat! This may take a few hours though. It's important to be cautious with what you eat during the healing process. The last thing we want is a piece of popcorn or other hard food getting lodged in your gums. Ouch... What to Eat After a Deep Cleaning Let's start with what not to eat. Here are some foods to avoid after a deep cleaning: - Avoid sharp or crunch foods, like nuts and popcorn, for at least 24 hours post-treatment - Avoid hot foods and beverages, like hot soup or hot coffee, for about 48 hours post-treatment - Avoid highly acidic foods, like oranges and tomatoes, for at least 48 hours post-treatment - Avoid spicy foods and alcoholic beverages for at least 48 hours to promote healing Can you eat ice cream after a deep cleaning? You may not want to eat anything too cold when your gums are still sensitive. It's best to avoid any food or beverages that are especially hot or cold until your gums are healed. Can you eat meat after deep cleaning? If the type of meat is challenging to eat, like a steak or pork chop, it may not feel too great biting into it with sensitive gums. Soft lunch meats or pull-apart meats should be okay to eat! Can you eat pizza after deep cleaning? Pizza can be relatively chewy and difficult to pull apart. You can use your discretion with pizza, but it's best to avoid any food that requires too much pressure from your gums.

Try to get as many nutrients in your diet as possible and drink lots of water. If you have a blender, try blending up some super fruits to make a nutritious smoothie. Here's a tasty recipe for a hearty smoothie that promotes healing: Heal & Recover Green Smoothie Ingredients: - 1 c ice - 1 small ripe banana - 1 small ripe avocado - 1 medium orange - 1/2 c fresh spinach - 1/4 c water - 1/2 teaspoon chia seeds - 1 teaspoon honey - 1 orange Directions: - Place all ingredients in a blender and mix until smooth. - Pour into a glass - Enjoy! How long does it take for gums to reattach after a deep cleaning? On average, it can take about a week for your gums to heal and reattach to your teeth roots. During this time, eat with caution!
