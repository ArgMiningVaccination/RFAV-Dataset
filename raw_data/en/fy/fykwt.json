Natural disasters such as the earthquake in Pakistan in 2005 or the Tsunami in Asia in 2004, terrorist atrocities around the world, or personal events such as physical or sexual assault, can result in psychological difficulties for those people directly affected by these events. The diagnostic term Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ofMental Disorders, 4th edition, DSM IV, 1994) is generally used to explain the often-severe psychological sequalae (van der Kolk, 1996; Servan-Schreiber, 2004; Shapiro, 1995) that people may exhibit when directly affected by trauma. However, what ofthose people not directly involved in the trauma, but those who have borne witness to it, either by listening to the stories of survivors, or in the case of the helping professionals (such as police officers, nurses, doctors, psychotherapists, fire-fighters), actively working with survivors in psychological distress? This paper examines the potential psychological consequences for those in helping professions who are working with traumatized clients. This paper then focuses on a specific treatment intervention, EMDR, utilizing a case study by way ofexplanation.[International Journal ofEmergency Mental Health, 2007, 9(4), pp. 291-298].

According to Mccann and PearJman's (1990) Constructionist Self-Development Theory (CSDT), people will give meaning to traumatic events depending on how, as individuals, they perceive them. These interpretations ofthe traumatic events may result in the HP experiencing changes in the way they view themselves, others, and their world. Mccann and Pearlman (1990) coined the term vicarious trauma to describe these disruptions in cognitive schemas. Schemas are core beliefs about the self, others, and the world, often developed from childhood experiences and maintained and reinforced throughout one's life (Young, 1990). Neuman and Gamble (1995) pmport that HP experiencing vicarious trauma begin to see the through \"trauma lenses.\" PearJmanand Saakvitine (l995a; p.31) state, ''Vicarious trauma is occupational hazard for nurses and other health profes\u00ad sionals who care for and support trauma survivors.\" Vicarious trauma (VT) is a process through which the HP's \"inner experience about the selfand the world is nega\u00ad tively transformed as a result ofempathic engagement with trauma survivors\" (Pearlman and Saakvitne, 1995a; p.279). Through exposure to their client's accounts of traumatic events and the realities ofpeople's intentional cruelty to one another andthe experience ofreliving terror, grief, andyearn\u00ad ing, the helper is vulnerable through empathic engagement as both witness and participant in these traumatic renactments. These effects are cumulative and may be per\u00ad m.anent (Pearlman and Saakvitne, 1995a). According to Dane and Chachkes (2001 ), VT develops over time and affects a person's professional and social identity. However not ev\u00ad eryone who is vicariously exposed to traumatic narratives develops symptoms ofVT (Lerias andByrne, 2003). So what may contribute to its development? Janoff-Bulm.ans' (l985)Assumptive World Theory posits the notion that individuals make assumptions about them\u00ad selves and the world, the assumptions being, \"J am invul\u00ad nerable, \" \"The world is just and makes sense, \" and \"Jam basically a goodperson. \"Whenexposed to trauma or help\u00ad ing victims oftrauma, these assumptions may be \"shattered\" (Janof-Bullman, 1985). Imagine a police officer's or paramedic's personal experience of bearing witness to the 1989 Hillsborough football tragedy where 96 Liverpool football supporters lost their lives. Then consider the helper's poten\u00ad tially \"shattered\" assumptive world; \"/am not invulnerable, \" \"The world does not make sense, people are not supposed to die at a football match,\" and \"/don t believe I am a good person, I should have done something, I don t know how to help. \" This shattering of assumptions can lead to PTSD in those actually involved and VT for those who bear witness. A further possible explanation may be the helper's own per\u00ad sonal trauma history. Ifa helper has personally experienced similartraumas to those oftheir client, this may well conjure up painful memories of their own traumatic experiences (Cunningham, 2003; Mccann& Pearlman, 1990; Pearlman & Saakvitne, 1995a, 1995b). According to Mccann and Pearlman's (1990) CSDT, as the helper is exposed to the graphic details of the clients' trauma, disruptions in the psychological need areas ofsafety, trust, esteem, power, and intimacymayoccur. (These themes will be explored later in the case study.) VT can result in the HP portraying cynicism, fear, sadness, and despair (Collins, 2001; Stevens-Guille, 2003; see Table 1 for further signs of VT). Itshouldbe remembered that VTis a normal response to working with traumatized people and witnessing their sto\u00ad ries. It is not the result ofthe helper's inadequacies or inher\u00ad ent weakness. The effects ofVT are unique to each helping professional, consistent with the individual difference premise intheCSDT. While there are positive aspects ofworkingwithtrauma\u00ad tized clients, such as a sense of competence in coping and maintaining an objective motivation, the concept of VT fo\u00ad cuses upon the negative aspects of transformation within the inner selfofthe person working with victims oftrauma (Bell, 2003). It is important to note that VT needs to be seen within the context ofthe work environment (Martin, 2006), as this environment can aid recovery or, conversely, stall it (Royle, 2006). As stated previously, VT has been described as an \"oc\u00ad cupational hazard\" (Pearlman and Saakvitne, 1995a; p.31) for mental professionals. We are also becoming increas\u00ad ingly aware ofhowpeople suffering from a mental illness can be stigmatized and excluded by members ofthepublic (Hay\u00ad ward& Bright, 1997; Hughes,2000;Gilbert,2000; Byrne,2000; examined the atti\u00ad tude ofnursing stafftowards co-workers returning from work following a psychiatric or physical illness. They found that staff who had suffered from a psychiatric condition were much more likely to be viewed negatively than ifthey had suffered from a physical condition. What strategies or inter\u00ad ventions, therefore, can be used to help the HP suffering 292 Keenan and Royle Vicarious Trauma, First Responders, and EMDR from VT? Attendance to the physical setting in the work\u00ad place (safe, private, comfortable), regular clinical supervision, team briefings, and balanced work and social life have been demonstrated to help sufferers ofVT (Pearlman & Saakvitne, 1995a; Figley, 1995). However, for some people there is a need for personal psychotherapy in order for them to over\u00ad come their distress. This paper will examine one such treat\u00ad ment modality, Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR; Shapiro, 1995). Signs of Vicarious Traumatlzatlon Reduced energy, exhaustion, lack of motiva\u00ad tion, feeling that you have no time for yourself Disconnection from others; feeling that other people don't really understand; you don't feel close to people any more; difficulties with your partner or in other close relationships Emotional blunting Questioning career choice, feeling ineffectual Errors in maintaining professional boundaries, failure to set limits, a general sense of failure and resentment Social withdrawal Feelings of despair and hopelessness Feelings of weakness, shame guilt, \"my prob\u00ad lems are nothing compared to theirs\" Loss of belief in the justice of life or in a sense of balance between good and bad, resulting in cynicism and bitterness Heightened sense of danger, feeling less secure, scanning for danger, including looking for violence and aggression in your environ\u00ad ment Sleeping problems and nightmares Difficulties in concentration Lack of self control, increased anger, impa\u00ad tience, strained relationship with others lntrusivity and flashbacks Changes to your inner sense of identity and equilibrium, i.e. you find it harder to experi\u00ad ence and integrate strong feelings, or to main\u00ad tain an inner sense of connection with others or to feel grounded and anchored within your\u00ad self Changes to your world view or spirituality, i.e. you have lost or changed your philosophy of life, your values and beliefs about others and the external world Herbert & Westmore (1999) Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) In 1989, Francine Shapiro published her seminal paper \"Efficacy ofthe eye movement desensitisation procedure in the treatment oftraumatic memories.\" In 2005 the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommended EMDR and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As an integrative psychotherapy, the efficacy 2000; Clinical Out\u00ad comes Efficiency Support Team, CREST-2003; Department of Veterans Affairs & Department ofDefence, 2004) with many randomised studies supporting its efficacy Rusnac, Power et al.,2002; Soberman, Greenwald, & Rule, 2002). For a critical review ofthe evi\u00ad dence see Maxfield and Hyer (2002). EMDR used effectively inthe treatment ofother psychological prob\u00ad lems, for example body dysmorphic disorder (Brown et al., 1997), non-psychotic morbid jealousy (Keenan & Farrell, 2000), phantom limb pain (rinker & Wilson, 2005), and anxi\u00ad ety disorders (Shapiro, 2005). What is EMDR? The procedure in EMDR makes use ofright, left, visual, kinaesthetic, and auditory stimulation while the client men\u00ad tally focuses on traumatic experiences (usually memories). Traumatic memory has three components: an image, a physi\u00ad ological reaction to this image, and a negative evaluation of the self as a consequence ofthis image/recollection. The procedure works with all three of these aspects by encouraging the client to think about the traumatic event while at the same time recognizing the physiological reaction in the here and now. The client is instructed to be aware of the negative evaluation ofthe self and then to receive bilat\u00ad eral stimulation from the clinician. The goal is to reduce the negative emotional response to the traumatic image and to reduce the level of physiological disturbance, along with a modification ofthe client's negative view ofthe self to a more realistic, appropriate, and adaptive view. The authors emphasise that although we refer to the ''procedure\" of EMDR, it is a psychotherapeutic process and therefore is\u00ad sues such as client safety, therapeutic alliance, comprehen- IJEMH Vol. 9, No. 4 2007 293 sive assessment and case conceptualization, confidentiality, boundary issues, and a full explanation of the model with valid consent are paramount. Principles ofEMDR (Shapiro, 2001) This model regards most pathology as derived from earlier life experiences that set in motion a continued pattern ofaffect, behavior, cognition, andconsequent identity structures. Pathology is viewed as configured by the impact of earlier lifeexperiences that are held inthe memory in state-specific form (therefore remaining as unproc\u00ad essed memories). Present day stimuli elicit the negative affect and be\u00ad liefs embodied in these memories and influence the person to continue to act in a way consistent with these earlier events. EMDR facilitates more positive and empowering present affect and cognitions to generalize the asso\u00ad ciated memories throughout the neuro-physiological network and leads spontaneously to more appropri\u00ad ate behaviors, thoughts, and feelings. Ibis paper now focuses on the case ofa helping profes\u00ad sional suffering from vicarious trauma. It will describe his psychological assessment and case conceptualization, be\u00ad fore exploring theuseofEMDR as a potential treatment Vicarious Trauma: A case study utilizing EMDR Bruce(name changed to preserve client anonymity) was a serving police officer with family liaison responsibilities. He was suffering from cumulative trauma through his help\u00ad ing role and feeling increasingly helpless and isolated. He reported being overburdened by events that had happened to others, including murders, serious accidents, and suicides. The clinical diagnosis from the referring Occupational Health Unit was depression. Bruce had received general counseling and then a short course of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. He did not feel any benefits from this and was referred for EMDR therapy some three years after his last significant incident. During this time, he had been on administrative duties and sickness leave. On assessment with a trauma clinician, Bruce reported the following symptoms synonymous with VT: Disconnection from others, social withdrawal and suspiciousness Feeling ineffectual and lacking confidence Feelings ofdespair, horror, and being overwhelmed Feelings ofweakness, shame, and guilt, continually examining his involvement in cases and questioning his actions Sleeping problems and nightmares Aversion offurther exposure to trauma narratives and \"bad news\" (via friends and media), yet simulta\u00ad neously obsessive thoughts about negative events and death Difficulties in concentration, memory recall, and in\u00ad ability to focus on work Increased anger, impatience, strained relationship with others, \"looking for a fight\" Intrusive images ofsituations he had been involved in Physical symptoms ofa painful stomach and rash on his face Bruce had previously served in the armed forces. He compared the difficult times he had encountered inthe armed forces with those in the police service. He described his atti\u00ad tude as relaxed and philosophical then. He felt that the army had been supportive andempowered him, whereas the police service had a \"them and us\" management style. He felt cyni\u00ad cal about the motives ofthose inpolice service management and sadness at how he had changed from being a highly confident and motivated individual. There was a complete lack oftrust in his managers to support him inhis role and a shattered belief in his own competence and self-esteem. VT had led to disruption in Bruce's cognitive schemas regarding his professional identity. His self-evaluation in\u00ad cluded phrases such as \"Jam useless, \" \"Iam worthless, \" \"I can ~ stand this, \" and \"/am vulnerable. \" Ibis exacerbated his feelings ofdespair and anger. Bruce had been prescribed an anti-depressant, Citalepram 20mg,by his GP. He was a non-smoker andhada 294 Keenan and Royle Vicarious Trauma, First Responders, and EMDR low to moderate alcohol intake. His previously good self\u00ad care (running and cycling) had completely stopped some time ago. As stated earlier, VT is a normal response, not an inherent weakness. However, Bruce's environment had ap\u00ad peared to hinder his recovery. Bruce had concerns that he was viewed negatively by his managers and had found it very difficult to admit to a problem - a common issue within the police service (Royle, 2003). He felt stigmatized, isolated, and was worried that nobody, his clinician included, would believe his condition was genuine. Accessing support had been a lengthy process and he had waited three years before being provided with appropriate therapy. Problems regard\u00ad ing rehabilitation and being on administrative duties exacer\u00ad bated this shame and feelings ofinadequacy. Bruce was referred for EMDR therapy (Shapiro, 1995) because this has been shown (NICE, 2005) to be an effective course oftreatment for his intrusive images and also because the previous counseling had not been seen as helpful by Bruce. His clinician agreed with this but felt more importantly that EMDR would be the most effective way ofdealing with the \"shattered schemas\" (Janoff-Bulman, 1985). EMDR treatment plan and typical session The treatment plan began with a consideration ofclient safety and building a therapeutic alliance (Shapiro 1995). A comprehensive assessment was made ofBruce's current situ\u00ad ation and past history. Issues of confidentiality and bound\u00ad aries were agreed upon and a full explanation ofthe model was given. Bruce gave his informed consent to EMDR Re\u00ad laxation methods and general stress management strategies were explored and evidence gained that he was committed to using these. To reiterate, the procedure in EMDRmakes use ofbilat\u00ad eral stimulation while the client mentally focuses on the trau\u00ad matic experiences. Visual stimuli, in the form ofright-left eye movements (EM) were utilized with Bruce. The most trau\u00ad matic memory targeted related to Bruce worlring with a family that had suffered a sudden and violent bereavement. This memory had resulted in intrusive imagery and thoughts that were still distressing him some three years later. The image he had was one ofhim leaving the house ofthe family and feel\u00ad ing tearful. The physiological reactions were those typical of anxiety. Bruce's negative evaluation ofhimself as a conse\u00ad quence ofthis recollection was \"/am vulnerable. \" Bruce was encouraged to think about this image, while at the same time being aware of his current physiological reactionandthe negative cognition ofvulnerability. Bilateral visual stimulation (moving his eyes from side to side by fol\u00ad lowing the movement ofthe clinician's hand) was then in\u00ad duced. Bruce noticed changes in his thoughts and emotions during subsequent series ofeye movements. He remarked on confusion as to why he was \"feeling wobbly\" and a fear of breaking down at an operational debriefing. He remembered comparing himselfwith other officers who were less closely involved in the case and feeling vulnerable in comparison. During the processing, a shift occurred in Bruce's self-evalu\u00ad ation. Between EM sets, he began to report the following positive changes: \"We 're all affected by different things at different times ... its never going to be the same incident, \" and \"rather than being vulnerable, I can be strong because I know the risks and can assert myselfin the future. \" Bruce was encouraged just to think about this. The EM continued until he reported feeling calm and repeated the same positive cognitions. The clinician then returned to the original target image and asked him to notice his thoughts and feelings andwhether these were different. Bruce reported no change to the image but a feeling of anger and a sense thatitwasn'this fault The clinician administered further EM and Bruce noticed his anger increasing and peaking before falling away. At this point, his thoughts were: \"/ learned a lotfrom all this. I can take control ofmy own welfare. \" Further EM led to a firmer emphasis on this more posi\u00ad tive self evaluation, \"When I'm properly better, I think I'd like to talk to probationers and tell them what can happen\" and finally, \"I'm not vulnerable. \" At this stage, Bruce reported feeling calm and confident in his ability to protect himself. His clinician asked him to hold this thought with the original image and administered further EM. When asked how true this new self-evaluation felt, Bruce believed it to be 100% true. He was asked to con\u00ad centrate on his body to see ifhe noticed any discomfort, but he reported no residual discomfort. The session was closed with a safety assessment and a reminder that information processing could continue. Bruce was keeping a log of his thoughts, feelings, memories, and dreams between sessions, which would be useful in reviewing any changes in his men\u00ad tal state prior to the next session. IJEMH Vol. 9, No. 4 2007 295 Outcome of Therapy Inthree subsequent sessions using bilateral visual stimu\u00ad lation, Bruce similarly tackled the main incidents that had occurredinhis duties as well asnegative cognitions concering power, Hewas changed by his experi\u00ad ence ofVT and felt that it had actually made him stronger now that he had dealt with those issues. His anger and lack of confidence were processed. Bruce ended therapy with a belief in his ability to do a good job and better protect his professional boundaries. He had resumed his self-care, par\u00ad ticularly in relation to exercise, and had, with his doctor's consent, discontinued the prescribed anti-depressants. At the end oftherapy, Bruce felt he needed to continue to build his confidence over time as he gradually returned to operational duties, but he was no longer overwhelmed and despairing about his role. Including assessment, he was seen for a total ofeight sessions. Bruce's progress was reviewed byhis therapist 15 months later. He remained free from medi\u00ad cation and was able to undertake operational police duties. He reported feeling and acting more assertively in respect to his professional boundaries and was optimistic about his future. Conclusion Vicarious trauma (VT) may wellbean\"occupational haz\u00ad ard\" (Pearlman and Saakvitne, l 995a; p.31) for the empathic helping professional (HP). This canlead the victim to experi\u00ad ence wide-ranging psychological distress, including intru\u00ad sive, aversive memories, lack of self-control, feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness, and social withdrawal (Herbert & Westmore, 1999). VT may also result in isolation in the working environment due the stigmatizing attitude of the victim's work colleagues and management (Glazier, Hough, Henderson, & Holland-Elliot, 2006). There are strategies that have been employed to lesson the likelihood of VT occur\u00ad ring, such as attending to the physical work setting (safe, private, comfortable), regular clinical supervision and team briefings, and a balanced work and social life (Figley, 1995). If, however,bearing witness to another person's tragedy does traumatize a helping professional, personal therapy can be an option. This paper has shown how one individual ben\u00ad efited from receiving EMDR, enabling himto return to work feeling more positive about his future. More research is re\u00ad quired when considering the most effective treatment op\u00ad tions for HPs; however, recognition that vicarious trauma is a factor in the working life ofHPs may at least encourage vic\u00ad tims to seek psychological help earlier.

He argues that the pastoral community is an essentialresource in the effort to rebuild lives and communities in the wake of trauma and disaster, but that this resource is often under-prepared and often overlooked. This book dares to change that. Pastoral Crisis Intervention is essential reading for clergy, pastoral counselors, and laity alike It should be mandatory reading for all students in formal religious education. 9 Order by phone, Monday-Friday, 9-5 EST, C410) 740-0085 -or- "}
