ADVANCE: Institutional Trans formation Program Annual Report to the National Science Foundation January 1, 200 2 - April 30, 2009 11 II. ACTIVITIES & FINDINGS Overview ADVANCE activities are administrated through a Committee on the Status of Women in STEM a t NMSU. The PI/Program Co -PI's, faculty from each of the three colleges involved in ADVANCE (Agriculture and Home Economics, Arts and Sciences, and Engineering) and program directors from related NMSU programs work on this Committee and its five subcommit tees. The five subcommittees manage the various programmatic elements and include several faculty members beyond those who work on the main Committee on the Status of Women in STEM. In addition, a new committee was formed upon the recommendation of exter nal evaluator Dr. Laura Kramer: The Transition Committee. The Transition Committee works to steer ADVANCE towards institutionalization. The Committee on the Status of Women in STEM (CSW -STEM) engages in outreach activities and is responsible for coordi nating the annual research report on the status of women in STEM at NMSU. The report forms the basis for subsequent programming to address gender disparities in STEM at NMSU. Over the course of the grant, a n office staff consisting of an Associate Direct or, Research Analyst, Graduate Assistant and two seasoned undergraduate student assistants have provide d necessary administrative, data collection and analysis, and logistical support for the CSW -STEM's, five subcommittees' and the ADVANCING Leaders Commit tee's activities. The Recruitment Subcommittee is involved with outreach (meetings with job candidates), research (surveys about search processes, startup, etc.) and training and development (work with departmental search committees) activities. The Facu lty Development Subcommittee is involved with educational and training and development activities. The Research Subcommittee meets to administer a program of grants to existing female STEM faculty for research and travel within their disciplines. The Distinguished Visiting Professor Subcommittee administers another research -related activity that involves a strong outreach component and makes women scientists more visible. The ADVANCING Leaders Subcommittee oversees a leadership development program for fa culty at NMSU, which included an academic year of monthly luncheons, and a two - day, off -campus retreat. Financial support is obtained from all six NMSU academic colleges and the library for the program. And an ad -hoc Exit Interviews Subcommittee conducts face-to-face and phone interviews to unders tand why STEM faculty leave. Research and Education The ADVANCE Program at NMSU supports institutional and faculty development research projects that are conducted largely by ADVANCE Program personnel (Frehill, Jeser -Cannavale, and Javurek -Humig) . In 2007, with the grant on a no -cost extension, the research and travel grant program for female STEM faculty in the 19 target STEM departments ended . All reports and data are posted to the ADVANCE program webpage. We routinely bring copies of reports to key administrators (e.g., the President, Provost, Vice Provost for Research, Deans, Director of the Teaching Academy, etc.) to discuss findings and seek assistance in solving problems. ADVANCE Program Staff Research Institutional Data : We compiled data for the 12 required indicators (except start -up packages) for the 19 STEM and 6 SBS departments as in the past (findings reported in the attached file) and we compiled many of these indicators for the non -STEM departm ents. In addition, this year we compiled more trend data to make meaningful presentations about the trends in women's involvement in STEM and academic administration for the five -year period prior to ADVANCE (i.e., 1997 -2001) and for the first five years of the ADVANCE Program. ADVANCE: Institutional Trans formation Program Annual Report to the National Science Foundation January 1, 200 2 - April 30, 2009 12 Attrition data for the entire campus were analyzed and presented to: Roles and Rewards Taskforce (and included in the Taskforce's second report to the Provost on Promotion and Tenure); the Associate Provost; the Vice Provost for Re search. Toolkit : Founding PI Lisa Frehill and Jeser -Cannavale produced a toolkit for other ADVANCE institutions to use in collecting, compiling and reporting the data for the 12 required indicators. The toolkit forms the basis for the supplemental fund ing award ($60,000) to bring together data analysts from several ADVANCE institutions to craft a uniform approach to the data reporting tasks. Program Analysis . We are collecting and analyzing data on participants in our programs to determine the overall effect of the program on individuals. Career Advancement . We are creating a cohort data set so that we can determine the career advances of faculty who were active with the ADVANCE Program over the course of the grant. Mentoring Program . An analysis o f the ADVANCE mentoring program was conducted. Twenty -four interviews with participants and 24 interviews with non -participants were conducted. A paper on this work appeared in conference proceedings . Publications Frehill, Lisa, Cecily Jeser -Cannavale, and Janet Malley.

Collection: \"Proceedings of the Women in Engineering Program Advocates Network Ann ual Conference.\" Dual Career Couples : ADVANCE personnel have worked with five couples at NMSU to make accommodations, which has resulted in recruitment/retention of six STEM faculty (including two college track females) and two social and behavioral scien ce faculty (both college track). ADVANCE: Institutional Trans formation Program Annual Report to the National Science Foundation January 1, 200 2 - April 30, 2009 13 Exit Interviews : Working through the Provost's Office in 2007, ADVANCE obtained a list of faculty who have left for reasons other than retirement and their contact information from Human Resources and the NMSU Institution al Review Board approved interviews. Thirty -four interviews were ultimately completed by Dr. Christine Eber of the Sociology/Anthropology Department. Dr. Eber, PI/PD Sterling and Associate Director Hunt presented the report to the Interim EVP/Provost Dr. Robert Moulton and Interim President Cruzado on December 15. (A copy of this report is included in the Appendices of the 2008 Annual Report and may be accessed at http://ww w.advance.nmsu.edu/Documents/PDF/Retention_Report -Nov08.pdf .) The report was also presented to the Academic Deans Council and in 2009 was presented to the Colleges of Engineering and the Faculty Senate, with plans to present it at the College of Business and other colleges . The impact of this effort on the institution is already evident: When Employee Relations was working to develop a university -wide exit interview process, their staff requested a meeting with ADVANCE exit interview researcher to review the questionnaire designed by ADVANCE. Diversity in engineering : Several presentations and papers have been based upon this work. Diversity as it relates to recruitment has been a consistent theme in this research strand. Institutionalization of ADVAN CE Significant changes have been brought about at New Mexico State University (NMSU) since the inception of the NSF -ADVANCE Institutional Transformation Program in 2002. ADVANCE was the first externally funded effort to deal with gender equity at NMSU. A s a result, its substantial monetary resources have provided leverage for a methodological study of the status of women in the disciplines of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) where women are under -represented in tenure -track faculty positions relative to Ph.D. degrees awarded. In addition, it has provided the resources to create programming and policy change to improve climate as well as double the numbers of tenure -track female faculty hired into STEM disciplines. The core initiativ es for faculty recruitment and retention are now available to all faculty on campus, as the program has been institutionalized and is now located in the Teaching Academy. In November 2008, over 40 faculty and administrators gathered to celebrate the accom plishments of the NSF - ADVANCE Institutional Transformation grant and to honor the many faculty, staff, and administrators whose vision and dedication made this initiative successful. The achievements of the female STEM faculty members whose work was suppo rted by ADVANCE were also recognized Looking back, it is clear that significant changes have been brought about since the inception of this $3.75 mi non-renewable grant. Specific successes and publications are enumerated at http://www.advance.nmsu.edu/ . Major recruitment and retention initiatives included: - Twenty -five new hires received over $1 mi in start -up package enhancement awards. This strategy coupled to working with Department Heads and Search Committe es to broaden applicant pools has doubled the hiring rate for female tenure -track faculty in STEM from 17% in the years prior to ADVANCE to 35% in the seven years of ADVANCE, creating a net increase in STEM female faculty of over 40% . - Bi-annual P&T worksho ps, the Mentoring program where there are now over 100 participants, Department Head Training, and the year -long ADVANCing Leaders Program are available to all faculty on campus - Strong grass -roots support with over 60 faculty members and administrators fil led 115 volunteer positions on the six ADVANCE committees over the life of the grant. - Partnering for policy change to create a transparent and flexible Promotion & Tenure process, the Employee Climate Survey, the President's Commission on the Status of Wo men, and NMSU's first Omsbud's office. - Over $1 mi for research, travel, undergraduate research, and visiting professor awards to enhance research and teaching programs, as well as build collaborations across the nation. ADVANCE: Institutional Trans formation Program Annual Report to the National Science Foundation January 1, 200 2 - April 30, 2009 14 - A new $0.5 mi award, NSF -ADVANCE PAI D, is disseminating our best practices of Mentoring and P&T workshops to UNM, NMT and LANL, and is also providing annual department head retreats to discuss recru itment and retention of faculty THE DATA: In a world where female and underrepresented minor ity faculty researchers in the sciences are in high demand, it is difficult for universities to attract high quality, diverse faculty members. For this reason, start up packages, and start -up package enhancement can play a huge role in attracting and reta ining high quality diverse faculty. This has been the experience of the ADVANCE Program at NMSU. The ADVANCE grant came at a very unique time in NMSU history. Recent waves of retirement in the STEM fields in 2001 had left several Tenure - track positions open. The ADVANCE Program was able to offer over $1 million in start up package enhancements to 25 tenure -track female scientists and engineers increasing the representation of high -quality female academic scientists at the university. NMSU's program worked to both increase awareness of diversity issues and bring in high demand female STEM faculty. By training department heads and search committees in proper searching techniques, about the importance of diversity, and about cognitive errors that we co mmonly make which may result in subtle discrimination, ADVANCE helped to reduce barriers to diverse candidates in the hiring process. By taking the time to meet with female candidates and working with departments to augment start up packages, the program was able to surpass its initial goal of increasing the number of women in STEM fields by 20%, and actually increased this by 40%. The number of STEM new hires roughly doubled the rate at which women were being hired into NMSU's STEM fields. The data pres ented in Appendix 1 illustrates the progress ADVANCE has made at NMSU INSTITUTIONALIZATION ACTIVITIES ADVANCE Co -PI University Leader In the aftermath of EVP/Provost's Flores appointment to the position of deputy secretary of higher education for the stat e of New Mexico , the university launched a search for a new EVP/Provost. In August 2007 the promotion to that position of Waded Cruzado , Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences and a Co -PI of the ADVANCE Program was announced. In July 2008, after Presid ent Michael Martin left NMSU to accept a position at Louisiana State University, the Regents appointed Dr. Cruzado to serve as Interim President. Dr. Cruzado has long championed ADVANCE goals at NMSU, and serves as a powerful ally in realizing the aims of the program. Promotion and Tenure Policy Revision Adopted PI/PD Sterling serve d as co -chair of the Provost -convened Faculty Senate Task Force on Promotion and Tenure Revision from Fall 2006 through September 2008 . In August 2008 the revised policy went into effect. Sterling and Dr. Larry Creider, Associate Professor of Library Archives and Special Collections , and past -chair of Faculty Senate , reviewed the revisions to the P&T policy with academic department heads from the College of Engineering on 8/27 /08 and with College of Arts and Sciences department heads on 1/8 -9/08. In addition Drs. Creider and Sterling met with the Executive Vice President/Provost (4/21/08) to discuss the revisions. Sterling had Co -Chaired the Task Force with Donna Alden, past Faculty Senate Chair and Roles and Rewards co-Chair with Frehill. In November 2006 t he Task Force had released a draft document for publi c comment across campus (including branch campuses and Extension faculty from across the state); each committee member had met with Department Heads and P&T committees from each College to engage dialog and encourage input. In January 2007 , the Task Force reconvene d, and incorporate d changes that were present ed as legislation to the Faculty Senate in s pring 2007. On May 3, 2007 the Faculty Senate passed Proposition 18 -06/07, which revised Sections 5.88, 5.90, and 5.91 of the NMSU Policy Manual. President Mike Martin approved the legislation on May 11, 2007 and the Board of Regents ratified the new promotion and tenure po licy on September 7, 2007 and October 22, 2007 . Additional edits were approved through the same process in Spring 2008 to clarify certain sections. In August and September 2008, Interim Provost Moulton ADVANCE: Institutional Trans formation Program Annual Report to the National Science Foundation January 1, 200 2 - April 30, 2009 15 reconvened the Task Force to edit each College's new policy to confirm it was in compliance with the new policy which was made official in August 2008 ( http://www.nmsu.edu/~fsenate/ptp/index.html ). This umbrella policy is to serve as a guide for Colleges and Department to increase the transparency of the t enure process and to recognize the need for flexibility, particularly with Stopping the Tenure Clock' and Part -Time Tenure - track positions' as well as the definition of Scholarship, ' and the need that candidates should be reviewed on their allocation of effort. Sterling and Senate Chair, Larry Creider, presented to the Dean's Summer Retreat the highlights of the new policy in order to guide the Deans as they re -write their College policies to come into compliance with the new University policy. Sterlin g chaired the College of Agriculture's P&T Action Team charged with, as per the new University policy, bringing the College Promotion and Tenure Document into compliance with the University's new policy. Faculty Senate Legislation for College -Track Facult y representation on Faculty Senate As Senator, Sterling sponsored a bill which passed Faculty Senate; the entire NMSU faculty voted to include non-tenure track faculty representation on Faculty Senate ( http://www.nmsu.edu/~fsenate/bills/voted/2007 - 2008/Pro p%20190708.pdf ). Exit Interviews Report Completed Working through the Provost's Office in 2007, ADVANCE obtained a list of faculty who have left and their contact information from Human Resources and the NMSU Institutional Review Board approved interviews . Thirty -four interviews were ultimately completed by Dr. Christine Eber of the Sociology/Anthropology Department. Dr. Eber, PI/PD Sterling and Associate Director Hunt and presented the report to the Interim EVP/Provost Dr. Robert Moulton and Interim Pre sident Cruzado on December 15. (A copy of this report is included in the Appendices.) The report was also presented to the Academic Deans Council and will be presented to the Colleges of Engineering and Business. The impact of this effort on the institu tion is already evident: When Employee Relations was working to develop a university -wide exit interview process, their staff requested a meeting with ADVANCE exit interview researcher to review the questionnaire designed by ADVANCE. PI/PD Sterling and D r. Christine Eber, Professor of Anthropology, had met with Provost Flores and Diana Quintana (HR) in 2006 to share an initial report on findings from 12 interviews of faculty who have left NMSU in STEM and non -STEM departments for reasons other than retire ment; we were encouraged to continue completing another 16 interviews of faculty who have left NMSU for reasons other than retirement. Permanent Funding for ADVANCE Programs and Personnel Obtained In July 2008 NMSU granted the ADVANCE Program in the Teach ing Academy $30,000 in Performance Award Funds to carry on four key programs: Mentoring, Promotion and Tenure, Leadership Development (ADVANCING Leaders), and Department Head Training. Performance Award Funds are reviewed annually for three years before becoming a permanent part of the budget. In 2007 the university Budget Committee had approved fully funding the Associate Director's salary starting in July. This position was placed administratively in the Teaching Academy within the College of Extended Learning and is permanently funded. The Teaching Academy is devoted to training Faculty in Professional D evelopment specific to teaching. It is a long -term collaborator of ADVANCE, helping to deliver many of the program's Best Practices (i.e. Mentoring, Department Head training, P&T Workshops, ADVANCING Leaders) . In 2007 and 2008 it served as a critical dissemination tool for t he newly awarded NSF -PAID grant , with the Teaching Academy Director Dr. Tara Gray becoming a Co-PI of PAID. Additional evidence of our partnership with the Teaching Academy and institutionalization was the continuing co-sponsor ship of Department Head training events in 2007 and spring 2008. With funding from ADVANCE, the Teaching Academy brought the CRLT players to NMSU, held wor kshops on assessment, and hosted a series of freewheeling discussions for department heads . Additionally, the Teaching Academy and ADVANCE joined with Black Studies and Chicano Programs to present a series of diversity lectures, featuring Harold Bailey, P eggy McIntosh and Tim Wise. Starting in fall 2008, ADVANCE offerings at the Teaching Academy have been funded by NMSU Performance Award Funds. ADVANCE: Institutional Trans formation Program Annual Report to the National Science Foundation January 1, 200 2 - April 30, 2009 16 Legislative Efforts With the support of President Michael Martin and EVP/Provost Flores, ADVANCE succeeded in g etting a house bill on the docket of the New Mexico State legislative session in 2005, 2006 and 2007. In these years PI/PD Sterling traveled to Santa Fe where she testified to the house committee on higher education. Annually Sterling submitted a Proposa l in June to the NMSU Budget Committee . President Martin brought the bill to the NM Legislatu re for the January session. In 2007 the bill request ed $600,000 to recruit diverse faculty in STEM disciplines through start -up package augmentation . It was a top priority for the College of Extended Learning, where both the ADVANCE grant and the permanent ADVANCE program are now housed . While the bill did not pass the senate, the progress made in 2007 constitutes a strong foundation for future efforts to obtain the support of state funds. Ombuds Office Created A proposal for an ombudsperson, crafted by founding PI Lisa Frehill and former Research Analyst Jeser - Cannavale, was approved in June 2007, and an Office of the Ombuds was created, under the direction of an assistant to the President. In a communication to the Faculty Senate, the Director of the Office of Ombuds publicly recognized the key role that ADVANCE and the President's Commission on the Status of Women played in this initiative. In 2008 for staff and faculty ombudspersons were appointed. Data Gathering In 2005, Institutional Research, Planning and Outcomes Assessment (IRPOA) was placed within Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). The director of IRPOA retired and a search was initiat ed. In December 2005, the ADVANCE PI/PD was invited to join the search committee for this position, and she worked actively on this committee throughout the Spring; Carmen Santana -Melgoza assumed the position in Summer 2006 and has been helpful in helping ADVANCE access critical data. In August of 2007 ADVANCE Research Analyst Abby Javurek -Humig joined the staff of IRPOA, in a newly created position that is designed to help meet the data -analysis needs of programs such as ADVANCE. In October 2007 IRPOA w as placed under the Office of the Executive Vice President/Provost. Working with the Chief Information Officer and IRPOA, ADVANCE obtained access to the raw data for this annual report and for NMSU's employee climate survey conducted in 2004. The data in cluded in the 2005 Annual Report is the first data report produced by any NMSU grant program based on raw personnel data. ADVANCE aggregated the Employee Climate Survey data so that differences between gender, units, and campuses could be available to eva luate climate in specific areas (http://irpoa.nmsu.edu/EmployeeClimateSurvey/EmployeeClimateSurvey.html ). NMSU had committed to another Employee Climate Survey in 2007 an d consistently thereafter, and to work with UW -Madison to generate questions that have been found by other ADVANCE institutions to be sensitive to gender differences or shown to be reliable indicators of institutional climate. However, the turnover in the position of EVP/Provost contributed to the postponement of this goal to 200 9. ADVANCE personnel met with interim Provost Moulton and Dire ctor of IRPOA in February 2009 and discuss ed the process for the second ECS, which has been assigned to an ad hoc com mittee. Gender Equity Policy As a member of the President's Commission on the Status of Women (PCSW) representing ADVANCE, the PI/PD worked on developing a gender equity policy during the past two years, that was approved in 2007. Very few universities in our country have established a gender equity policy. No other university in New Mexico has such a policy. The policy sets foundation to ensure that gender equity is a value for NMSU. With this policy statement, the Administration will determine whether additional recommendations from the President's Commission on the Status of Women will be implemented in the future. Other accomplishments include finalizing a draft of the search committee handbook that is open, transparent, and describes a gender -neutra l process. Location of ADVANCE within Teaching Academy ADVANCE: Institutional Trans formation Program Annual Report to the National Science Foundation January 1, 200 2 - April 30, 2009 17 To help move forward institutionalization, the program relies on specialized part -time staff. Using indirect funds, the program hired a seasoned part -time major gifts officer, Mark Hohnstreiter. As a permanent part -time employee of the NMSU Teaching Academy, Hohnstreiter is familiar with faculty development programs and with the NMSU foundation, for which he has also worked on a contractual basis. This professional works to stage events intended as advocacy and outreach activities attendees ranging from key ADVANCE participants and committee members, NMSU leadership, deans, and department heads, members of the NMSU Foundation, media, elected officials, and University donors. Other participants have included the local chapter of the American Association of University Women and the NM High Tech Research Consortium. We make a general presentation on the accomplishments of the program, present status, and future directions, and engage the group in discu ssion. Placing the ADVANCE Program within the Teaching Academy provides access to a strong administrative infrastructure, as evidenced by the assistance given by the Teaching Academy webmaster, who re -designed the ADVANCE website (http://www.advance.nmsu.edu/ ) to update it and conform to NMSU style guides. In addition, on -line registration is now available for ADVANCE events, again through the Teaching Academy. The majority of ADVANCE programs and events took pl ace in the Teaching Academy meeting room. The PI/PD also continued in an effort to work out strategies for a regional consortia approach to addressing the needs of dual career couples. In 2008, the Deans of NMS U ADVANCE's three target colleges - Dean Lowell Catlett of the College of Agriculture and Home Economics, Dean Pamela Jansma of the College of Arts and Sciences and Dean Steven Castillo of the College of Engineering - provided the funding to bring MentorNet to NMSU. ADVANCE: Institutional Trans formation Program Annual Report to the National Science Foundation January 1, 200 2 - April 30, 2009 18 Findings Indicators and Rep orts See 200 8 tables report ing the 12 required indicators in Appendix I. Data for earlier years may be accessed at: http://www.advance.nmsu.edu/Resources/Data_Reports/index.html Recruitment Efforts ADVANCE at NMSU spent a total of $884,035 on start -up package enhancements for 24 women scientists/engineers, and $95,346 on dual -career accommodation enhancements for four. In addition as the final no -cost extension neared its end, ADVANCE met with three candidates who were successfully hired by NMSU, starting in the fall of 2009. All three candidates are in the College of Engineering, and one candidate, hired by Mechanical Engineering, is the first women tenure -track faculty member in the history of the department, which spans over 100 years. A list of candidates and the years of the hire follows. Abstracts of start-up fund awards are shown in the following pages. Dr. Dobroski is arriving in Fall 2009, and will be the first woman to fill a tenure -track position in the Department of Mechanical Engineering throughout the more than 100 -year history of that department. For a start -up fund enhancement recipient listing and abstracts please see Appendix V. ADVANCE Undergraduate Resear ch Scholarships ADVANCE Undergraduate Research Scholarships were designed to permit ADVANCE recipients of internal awards (start -up fund enhancements or research grants) and other female STEM faculty to work with female undergraduate students on research p rojects. A total of 18 students were paired with women STEM faculty members who oversaw their independent research projects. The students received a total of $32,000 in scholarship support to conduct this research. Scholarships provided $1,000 per semes ter for up to two semesters, including summer terms. For Undergraduate Research Scholarship recipient listing and abstracts please see Appendix V. Opportunities for Training and Development Throughout the grant, ADVANCE supported training and outreach e fforts that involved as many members of the NMSU as possible, and allowed the program director and staff to widely disseminate our program's best practices and findings. The ADVANCE Program provided training programs that reached many faculty and administ rators from almost every NMSU academic department and a limited number of students (graduate and undergraduate). In addition to ADVANCE events on campus, the ADVANCE Program provides support to the NMSU Teaching Academy and enables STEM faculty, administr ators, and students to attend important off - campus workshops and conferences related to gender in the STEM fields. For a listing by year of outreach and training/development initiatives, please see Appendix III. Programs and Grants Related to Diversity i n STEM Fields A number of ADVANCE program participants have obtained grants funding STEM gender diversity initiatives at NMSU. Others have won grants that work to increase participation in STEM by underrepresented students. And one researcher into the e ffect of maternal sensitivity on infant learning is conducting research related to family and life -balance issues. The Computer Science Summer Program, funded by an NSF CREST grant , is headed by PI Dr. Desh Ranjan, Academic Department Head of Computer Sci ence and ADVANCE mentor. In the summer of 2008 ( July 7 -Aug. 8) the Department of Computer Science at New Mexico State Universi ty offered three programs to increase participation by underrepresented groups in computer science and bioinformatics. The CREST program at NMSU is aimed at introducing community college students from underrepresented minority groups to NMSU, Computer Science, possible career opportunities in ADVANCE: Institutional Trans formation Program Annual Report to the National Science Foundation January 1, 200 2 - April 30, 2009 19 Computer Science, and the field of bioinformatics. This program is particularly intereste d in attracting women and American Indian students, who historically are underrepresented in the field of Computer Science. Thirty -four people participated in the three programs in the summer of 2008 : Young Women in Computing, the High School Bioinformat ics Summer Program and the College Camp. The Young Women in Computing Summer Camp , first funded in 2005, is exclusively for female high school students . Female students accepted into this program receive free books, materials and meals, as well as $200 we ekly for five weeks. Accepted participants also have the opportunity to participate in monthly luncheons during the academic year to meet experts and learn valuable skills for their future college careers. In September 2008 Computer Science faculty members Drs. Inna Pivkina (recipient of ADVANCE start - up enhancement funds) and Professor Enrico Pontelli (ADVANCE mentor), along with Assistant Professor Karen Villaverde were awarded a $600,000 NSF Broadening Participation in Computing supplemental grant for th e Young Women in Computing program. With this three -year supplemental grant the team hopes to expand the program beyond its original five -weeks of summer classes and monthly seminars. Dr. Villaverde is an ADVANCE mentee who was recently moved from the no n- tenured to the tenure track. ADVANCE start -up enhancement recipient, Associate Professor Jing He of the Department of Computer Science, is a PI of NMSU CREST: Center for Research Excellence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology grant (National Sci ence Foundation, 2004 -2009, $4,500,000 ). CREST devotes resources to sponsoring outreach in the field of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology that actively recruits from community colleges in the Southwest, including Dona Ana Community College, El Paso Community College, San Juan College, and Dine College, located on the Navajo Nation. All students must be current community college students interested in computer science who have expressed an interest in transferring to a four -year institution. Dr. Elb a Serrano , Professor of Biology is a recipient of ADVANCE research funds , has served in the ADVANCE mentoring program as both a mentor and trainer, and has participated in the ADVANCING Leaders Program. In January 2008, Dr. Serano assumed directorship of NMSU's National Institutes of Health Research Initiative for Scientific Enhancement (RISE) program to increase the number of underrepresented minority students who achieve Ph.D. degrees. Professor Laura Thompson of the Department of Psychology is a past pa rticipant of the ADVANCING Leaders Program and an ADVANCE mentor. In 2008 she received a four -year, $1.1 million grant from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development to study how infant adrenocortical functioning and learning are affected by various factors in the environment, including maternal sensitivity. ADVANCE mentor and Promotion and Tenure trainer Dr. Mary O'Connell of Plant and Environmental Sciences is a PI of the NMSU U54 Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research. New Mexico State University and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Seattle, WA) was awarded a $10 million National Cancer Institute grant to support a partnership between these two institutions. The partnership's major objecti ve is to establish cancer research at NMSU and to increase the number of minorities involved in cancer research. The grant was initially funded 2002 -2007 and has been renewed 2007 -2012. National and Local Recognition of Participants in ADVANCE Programs Many ADVANCE participants have achieved recognition that reflects well on the influence of ADVANCE in promoting a climate that supports advancement of women and minorities at NMSU. Dr. Jeanine Cook, Associate Professor in the Klipsch School of Electrical a nd Computing Engineering and recipient of ADVANCE start -up funds enhancements, was selected in December 2008 as one of the winners of the prestigious Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE). Dr. Cook directs the Advanced Comp uter Architecture Performance and Simulation Laboratory at NMSU. She was recommended for the PECASE award by the Sandia National Laboratory scientists whose applications performance problems Cook solved by building a simulator to pinpoint the problem's ex act location.

Steven Castillo, Dean of the College of Engineering, will serve as Provost of the Colorado School of Mines starting July 2009. ADVANCING Leaders participant Susan Brown, director of the Southern New Mexico SEMAA (Scienc e, Engineering, Mathematics, and Aerospace Academy) at NMSU, received the 2007 John M. Hairston Jr. Award from NASA's SEMAA office. Professional Accomplishments of ADVANCE Participants Many ADVANCE participants have achieved career milestones that reflect well on the influence of ADVANCE in promoting a climate that supports advancement of women and minorities at NMSU. ADVANCE Co -PI Waded Cruzado, formerly dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, was appointed Executive Vice President/Prov ost of NMSU in A ugust of 2007. In the fall of 2008 Dr. Cruzado was selected as Interim President by the Board of Regents, in the wake of President Michael Martin's departure to accept a position as Chancellor of Louisiana State University. Dr. Cruzado is the first woman ever to serve as Provost or President at NMSU. ADVANCE Co -PI and NMSU Executive Vice President/Provost Dr. William Flores, a strong ally of ADVANCE initiatives throughout the life of the grant, was appointed deputy secretary of higher ADVANCE: Institutional Trans formation Program Annual Report to the National Science Foundation January 1, 200 2 - April 30, 2009 21 education for the sta te of New Mexico in May 2007 and starts as President of the University of Texas, Houston -Downtown starting July 1. ADVANCE Co -PI and NMSU Associate Provost, Dr. Josephine De Leon, was appointed deputy secretary of higher education for the state of New Mexi co (October 2005 - May 2006). In April 2008 she accepted a position at the University of New Mexico as Vice President for Equity and Inclusion , where she is working with Sterling on the collaborative PAID grant to disseminate NMSU's best practices to NM I nstitutions of Higher Learning and Research. Dr. Michele Nishiguchi, Associate Professor of Biology, recipient of ADVANCE research fund and participant in the ADVANCING Leaders Program who has served as mentee, mentor and workshop facilitator in the ADVANC E mentoring program was named as the new leader of the NMSU Bioscience Cluster in April of 2008, charged with invigorating interdisciplinary research under a broad spectrum of bioscience -related research areas. Dr. Rebecca Creamer, Associate Professor in t he Department of Entomology, Plant Pathology and Weed Science, recipient of ADVANCE research funds and participant in the ADVANCE mentoring program was named the Director of the Molecular Biology Program at NMSU In August 2008. Diana Quintana, formerly Dir ector of Human Resources, was appointed Assistant to the President and Director of the Office of Ombuds in 2007. On Campus Events The ADVANCE Program features a number of training events associated with mentoring, department head training and ADVANCING Le aders programs. Attendance at these events averages about 26 people. In November 2007, the ADVANCE Program co -sponsored a diversity lecture series presented by Black Programs, featuring Harold Bailey, Executive Director of the New Mexico Office of Africa n-American Affairs, Peggy McIntosh, Director of the Wellesley Centers for Women of Wellesley College, and anti -racist writer and activist Tim Wise . While the mentoring program focuse d predominantly upon faculty in the STEM and then added SBS fields, sever al participants are from departments outside these target disciplines and several key NMSU administrators outside of STEM participate in this program. An additional cohort of all colleges was recruited this year and the program expand ed to include all new tenure -track faculty to NMSU , with plans to include college -track STEM faculty in the future . In fall 2008, with the ADVANCE Program established at the Teaching Academy, the focus of the program was broadened to include all faculty, especially underrepre sented faculty, and all faculty participating in the New Faculty Orientation session were invited to participate. The ADVANCING Leaders Program also reaches across campus in important ways. Not only are the participants from all six academic colleges plu s the NMSU Library, but the invited speakers include important administrators at NMSU .

ADVANCE: Institutional Trans formation Program Annual Report to the National Science Foundation January 1, 200 2 - April 30, 2009 25 IV. Contributions Within PI Discipline In 2008 t he PI/PD was named C o-PI on a new NSF PAID grant (Partnerships in Adaptation, Implementation and Dissemination), PROMOTE. PROMOTE is headquarter ed at Utah State University withs five other universities including NMSU. The grant's aim is to improve the Promotion to Full process at each university. USU will interview professors at each university, and each university will offer a workshop session for promotion to full within the first year of the grant. Each university will also work to ensure that STEM colleges have guidelines in place for promotion to full. In 2007 the PI/PD was named PI on the NSF PAID grant awarded to NMSU. This grant seeks to disseminate best practices for mentoring, promotion and tenure training and department head training with partner institutes: University of New Mexico, New Mexico Institute for Mining and Technology, and Los Alamos National Laboratory. The Associate D irector, in her new capacity as head of the permanently established ADVANCE Program at the NMSU Teaching Academy, became a member of the NMSU Diversity Council in Fall 2008. The Diversity Council serves as an engaged advocate for achieving a diverse facul ty, staff and student body by creating effective and meaningful recommendations and policy in support of an inclusive university environment. Through 2007 the Research Analyst worked with founding PI Frehill to prepare a number of manuscripts within the field of sociology. To some extent, the data related to the institution and the question of how to make meaningful and appropriate cross -institutional comparisons among the original nine ADVANCE institutions has formed the basis of one thread of work, meas uring the status of women. This work will continue, with additional presentations and pub lications. Other related research use d in-depth qualitative interviews and other programmatic records maintained by the ADVANCE program to understand how institution al forces affect faculty work lives. Frehill and the research analyst, also a sociologist, worked on several projects to be presented at sociology and educational management conferences. These projects examine d the impact of the mentoring program and the study of space allocation that we have completed at NMSU. Contributions to Other Disciplines Over the course of the grant, ADVANCE funds have assist ed in the preparation of scholarly work in eight STEM disciplines: Plant and Environmental Sciences , biolo gy, computer science, fishery and wildlife, food sciences, geological sciences, industrial engineering, and mathematical sciences. Wide -reaching contributions across the STEM fields have been and will continue to be made as a result of this grant. Develo pment of Human Resources ADVANCE start -up package enhancements, research awards, mini -grants and undergraduate student researcher scholarships have been essential to scholar's professional development over the life of the grant. ADVANCE start -up fund enha ncements contributed to breakthrough hires in two departments. The Physics Department, which had been without a female tenure -track position since 2002, was able to hire Dr. Kanani Lee. And in Biology, Michele Shuster transitioned from college track to tenure track - a major success for the ADVANCE Program which has engaged in activities to develop college track women to enable them to compete successfully for future tenure -track openings. Dr. Shuster was a recipient of ADVANCE mini -grants in 2006. ADVANCE research funds contributed to the professional development of recipients. M. Cristina Mariani, a recipient of the first round of start -up package enhancements, became the first in that cohort to receive tenure . Within a year she was promoted to f ull professor . Her progress was augmented by an ADVANCE research grant. An ADVANCE research grant was also instrumental in the tenure of Elizabeth Gasparim, also of the Department of Mathematical Sciences. Susana Salamanca -Riba used her research funds t o work with a ADVANCE: Institutional Trans formation Program Annual Report to the National Science Foundation January 1, 200 2 - April 30, 2009 26 collaborator at MIT on a wide -ranging project on Lie groups. And Nancy Flores of Food Science conducted research to collect data designed to contribute to future USDA and CREES grant proposals. The ADVANCING Leaders Program and the departme nt head training sessions contributed the development of the managerial capabilities of women in science and the furthering of a constructive university climate. A majority of the ADVANCING Leaders participants are women. Of the two new interim departmen t heads appointed in 2005, both became full Department Head s: Martha Mitchell (Chemical Engineering) and Sonya Cooper (Engineering Technology). Both were associate professors who were promoted to full professor while serving as the first women department heads within the College of Engineering. Discussions between the ADVANCE program, the Dean of the College of Engineering, and the two new department heads contributed to effectively improving their skills as department heads and ensuring that they maintai ned research productivity essential for promotion to full professor. A graduate of the ADVANCING Leaders Program, Tracy Sterling (Weed Science) assumed the role of ADVANCE PI and Program Director when Frehill took professional leave . The ADVANCE Program granted scholarships of up to $2,000 to 18 female undergraduate students who assisted in the research of their faculty mentors in 2008 . Megan Lockwood, working with her faculty mentor, Elizabeth Gasparim of Mathematical Sciences, studied string theory - work which she has found helpful as she continues her studies in physics. Kalli Lambeth, working with Kathryn Hanley of Biology, studied patterns of inter-seotypic competition in dengue virus. Not only does this scholarship program encourage undergraduate female STEM students to pursue graduate work and perhaps faculty careers by forming mentoring relationships with their faculty sponsors - these sponsors in turn receive valuable assistance in their research by highly motivated students. The ADANCE Progra m mini -grant enabled Associate Professor Inna Pivkina and Professor Enrico Pontelli of Computer Science to present Recruiting High School Women into Computer Science at the Birds of a Feather Session of the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing: We Build a Better World (10/1 - 4/08). Attendance at the Grace Hopper Celebration enabled these faculty members to increase their understanding of the underlying issues confronting broadening participation of women in computing, and to learn more about ot her attempts and initiatives in this area. Mini-grant recipient David Finston's participation in the Mathematical Association of America 2006 session on Models That Work: Building Diversity in Advanced mathematics, furthered his development as a spokesp erson on the topic of minority doctorates and the pipeline. Mini -grants also contributed to the professional development of Dr. Muhammad Dawood of Electrical and Computer Engineering, who attended an intensive week -long teaching institute, Boot Camp for P rofs. Dr. M. Cristina Mariana used her mini -grant funds to attend a special session on recent developments on fluid and geophysical fluid dynamics at the American Mathematical Society Spring Southeastern Meeting 2006. She took advantage of her attendance at the conference to discuss developing a professional master program in financial mathematics - an initiative she is developing at NMSU with the Finance Department. Julieta Valles -Rosales of Industrial Engineering and Paola Bandini of Civil and Geologic al Engineering were able to use ADVANCE research awards to leverage resources \u2014additional funds or equipment --from the college and their departments. Both have also successfully competed for external research funding, with Valles -Rosales winning a $62,192 g rant from SCERP (with two co -PIs from the Department of Management, including her mentor Bonnie Daily) and Bandini receiving $50,000 from the New Mexico Department of Transportation. As the ability to generate external funds has become more vital within t he promotion and tenure process at NMSU, these early successes bode well for both of these faculty members within the College of Engineering. Nancy McMillan of Geology received $25,000 from the Army to continue her research on tracing geologic processes a nd terrorist trading ADVANCE has helped build an infrastructure to support sustained efforts at increasing gender and ethnic equity by sending Dario Silva, Director, Employee Assistance Program and Laura Godwin, Assistant Professor, Theatre to the Center for Research on Learning and Teaching Theatre Program Summer Institute. Building on ADVANCE: Institutional Trans formation Program Annual Report to the National Science Foundation January 1, 200 2 - April 30, 2009 27 their training, ADVANCE will work to develop a consistent, institutionalized use of effective theatre techniques to promote gender and ethnic equity among the faculty and students at NMSU. Dr. Silva will be participating in a performance by the Cornell Players, who will be coming to NMSU in the fall of 2009. The program engaged in activities to develop women who ranked as college track (not eligible for tenure) at NMSU to enable them to compete successfully for future tenure track openings. All five women in this case are part of dual career couples. Funds were provided to Dr. Michele Shuster in Biology and Dr. Nancy Chanover in Astronomy for this purpose, and both w ere ultimately transition ed to tenure track. Dr. Chanover was the Co -PI on three separate grants and subcontracts, including a $2.7 million NASA grant with the noted Rete Beebe as the PI. This track record and the publications Dr. Chanover produced equip ped her well to compete for an open tenure -track position. Dr. Shuster's position focuses on the scholarship of teaching, which has been elevated under the new, Boyer -based policy for promotion and tenure that was spearheaded by ADVANCE PI Sterling. Finally, Dr. Linda Riley , the first chair of the ADVANCE Committee on Recruitment, left NMSU to become the Associate Dean of the School of Engineering at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island. Dr. Laura Huenneke left NMSU to become the Dean of Arts and Sc iences at Northern Arizona University. PI Frehill left NMSU to become the Executive Director of the Commission on Professionals in Science and Technology . PI Sterling is leaving NMSU to become chair of the department of Land Resources and Environmental S ciences at Montana State University -Bozeman. And Maria Christina Mariani, recipient of ADVANCE start -up funds, is leaving NMSU to chair the Department of Mathematics at the University of Texas, El Paso. Within the larger perspective of ADVANCE's intended effects on higher education, the movement of a STEM woman from a department head position to one of academic leadership is important to note. Dr. Huenneke indicated that her substantial participation in the ADVANCE program helped her to envision herself as a dean. Physical, institutional, or information resources that form the infrastructure for research and education. The ADVANCE program was instrumental in providing significant support for increased information resources at NMSU for STEM and non -STEM fields. Working with the Office of the Provost, the Hispanic Faculty/Staff Caucus, the Teaching Academy and Faculty Senate the program provided support for broad -based institutional training. ADVANCE program funds have been essential to the launch of the NMSU Teaching Academy. In addition, the program, in collaboration with the University of Texas at EL Paso ADVANCE Program, has produced a brochure on Dual Career Couples for use by the institutions in solving dual career dilemmas. The program brough t top administrators and department heads together to attend Virginia Valian's briefing dinner and discuss gender equity in recruitment and working across colleges and disciplines. The program has established a reputation among department heads of providi ng quality, value -added programming that is truly relevant to their administrative roles. NMSU President Martin has continued these conversations with President Natalicio of UTEP, demonstrating an institutional commitment to dual career issues. The ADVAN CE program website, and the vital connections maintained with the other ADVANCE institutions have been essential in making information about institutional change easily accessible to a wide audience. The PI, Research Analyst, and Research Analyst made pre sentations about women's status in STEM fields and the ADVANCE Program to various NMSU , state, and national audiences. Program personnel participation in other institutional efforts - notably a campus -wide Provost's Taskforce on Roles and Rewards, the Pre sident's Commission on the Status of Women, the Committee on Diversity and the Employee Climate Survey Committee are important in disseminating the information learned via the many data collection efforts of the program across campus. Such involvement ins ures that issues related to the status of women at the institution are kept at the forefront of these other institutional efforts. ADVANCE: Institutional Trans formation Program Annual Report to the National Science Foundation January 1, 200 2 - April 30, 2009 28 Other Aspects of Public Welfare Research on diversity in science and engineering is important in deter mining how more women and under - represented minorities can be recruited and retained at all levels of the science engineering pipeline. Affecting the pipeline is also one important role of the Distinguished Visiting Professor program. Every ADVANCE Visiting Professor visited K-12 classrooms or educators as part of their visits . Such women were an inspiration to the young girls in these classes, providing them with role models affirming that there are women in science .

Deans and/or associate deans from all seven of NMSU's colleges attended at least one ADVANCE event. The President, two Vice Presidents, two Vice Provosts, all three members of the Provost's Office, and eleven s enior administrators participated in at least one ADVANCE event. Because the goal of ADVANCE is institutional transformation, involvement of faculty and administrators from across campus is essential in changing the institution and for garnering support f or the continuation of ADVANCE programs after the end of the award period. Appendix II Participants' Summaries 4 2005 Participants' Summary 100 (37 female, 73 male) STEM faculty and department heads from all of the 19 target STEM departments attended at least one ADVANCE event. 94 faculty a nd department heads from 30 of the 36 non -STEM NMSU departments participated in an ADVANCE event. 97 faculty and administrators \u2014mostly from STEM fields, with 14 from the social sciences \u2014 participated in the mentoring program (half men, half women). 35 depar tment heads from as many academic departments (including 19 STEM departments) attended at least one ADVANCE -sponsored department head training event. Deans and/or associate deans from all seven of NMSU's colleges attended at least one ADVANCE event. The Pr esident, two Vice Presidents, two Vice Provosts, all three members of the Provost's Office, and eleven senior administrators participated in at least one ADVANCE event. Because the goal of ADVANCE is institutional transformation, involvement of faculty an d administrators from across campus is essential in changing the institution and for garnering support for the continuation of ADVANCE programs after the end of the award period. To facilitate this, the program brought Dr. Virginia Valian to campus to con duct an intensive schedule of meetings, workshops and talks involving department heads, recruitment committee chairs, upper administration, the ADVANCING Leaders Program, Women's Studies, graduate students and the wider NMSU community. This program was co -sponsored by the Colleges of Agriculture and Home Economics, Arts and Sciences, Education, Engineering, the Physical Sciences Laboratory and the Library \u2014all of whom contributed substantially to the cost of bringing Dr. Valian to NMSU. Appendix II Participants' Summaries 5 2004 Participants' Summary 99 (37 female, 62 male) STEM faculty from 18 of the 19 target STEM departments attended at least one ADVANCE event. 60 faculty and department heads from 25 of the 36 non -STEM NMSU departments participated in an ADVANCE event. 80 facu lty and administrators \u2014mostly from STEM fields \u2014participated in the mentoring program (half men, half women). 30 department heads from 26 academic departments (including 11 STEM departments) attended at least one ADVANCE -sponsored department head training e vent. Deans and/or associate deans from all eight of NMSU's colleges attended at least one ADVANCE event. The President, two Vice Presidents and all three members of the Provost's Office participated in at least one ADVANCE event. Almost all female STEM f aculty members were involved in some aspect of the ADVANCE program during the past year. Many department heads --from STEM and non -STEM departments --participated in ADVANCE -Sponsored programming that was part of a series of department head workshops. The evaluator (Dr. Ann Austin) met with numerous people, most of whom were from non -STEM departments at NMSU to discuss ADVANCE. Dr. Austin's evaluation followed up on previous evaluations (one by Dr. Austin and two by Dr. Laura Kramer) to provide the NMSU AD VANCE team with guidance on how best to expand the program to involve faculty throughout the institution. Because the goal of ADVANCE is institutional transformation, involvement of faculty and administrators from across campus will be essential in changi ng the institution and for garnering support for the continuation of ADVANCE programs after the end of the award period. Several deans attended the ADVANCE PI meeting and conference hosted by Georgia Tech this year: Dean Waded Cruzado -Salas (College of Arts and Sciences); Associate Dean Jeffrey Brown (College of Arts and Sciences); Dean LeRoy Daugherty (College of Agriculture and Home Economics and Director of the Agricultural Experiment Station); and Associate Dean Rudi Schoenmackers (College of Enginee ring). In addition, the newly appointed Dean of the College of Engineering, Dr. Steven Castillo, attended the two - day ADVANCE/NSF Engineering Directorate workshop in Arlington, VA on December 13 -14, 2004. Appendix II Participants' Summaries 6 2003 Participants' Summary Almost all female S TEM faculty members were involved in some aspect of the ADVANCE program during the past year. Many department heads --from STEM and non -STEM departments --participated in ADVANCE -Sponsored programming that was part of a full day of department head workshops or the departmnet head roundtable event. The evaluator (Dr. Laura Kramer) met with 26 different people at NMSU to discuss ADVANCE. In addition, ADVANCE programming reached faculty members from across the university via a Promotion and Tenure Workshop, v ia programming offered by the Teaching Academy and sponsored by ADVANCE, via public presentations about the program on camps, and via the mentoring program. All NMSU Deans and senior administrators learned of the ADVANCE program via a presentation at Provo st's Council. Other outreach efforts, especially those associated with Distinguished Visiting Professors' programming, reached undergraduate and graduate students in STEM, K-12 teachers in the community, and other members of the Las Cruces community with v arious educational programs. 2002 Participants' Summary Thirty -three of the 41 female STEM faculty members (80%) were involved in some aspect of the ADVANCE program during its inaugural year. All 19 STEM department heads and almost all NMSU department heads participated in ADVANCE -Sponsored programming that was part of a full day of department head workshops. The two evaluators met with 49 different people at NMSU to discuss ADVANCE. In addition, ADVANCE programming reached 77 faculty members from acr oss the university via a Promotion and Tenure Workshop and all NMSU Deans learned of the ADVANCE program when they met with the PI, who solicited their input for a Dual Career Couple Program at NMSU. Other outreach efforts, especially those associated wit h Distinguished Visiting Professors' programming, reached undergraduate and graduate students in STEM, K -12 teachers in the community, and other members of the Las Cruces community with various educational programs. APPENDIX III OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT 2009 III Opportunities for Training and Development 1 Throughout the grant, ADVANCE supported training and outreach efforts that involved as many members of the NMSU as possible, and allowed the program director and staff to widely disseminate our program's best practices and findings. The ADVANCE Program provided training programs that reached many faculty and administrators from almost every NMSU academic department and a limited number of students (graduate and undergraduate). In addition to ADVANCE events on campus, the ADVANCE Program provides support to the NMSU Teaching Academy and enables STEM faculty, administrators, and students to attend important off -campus workshops and conferenc es related to gender in the STEM fields. 2009 Conferences PI Tracy Sterling served as a symposium speaker (1/15/09) at the Weed Science Society of America, presenting on Diversity and Inclusion: Why all the Fuss?

PI - Mai Gehrke Title - Professor Department - Mathematical Sciences Type - Research , 2003 -2005 Type - Interdisciplinary research collaborations in problems of logic and computer science In the period 2003 -2005 Ge hrke received funding through the NSF ADVANCE Institutional Transformation Award at New Mexico State University, amounting to an approximate total o f $40,000 in all. The funding was been made through a number of subawards for various specific purposes, th ough most of them have been targeted at allowing Gehrke to develop interdisciplinary research collaborations in order to take her work in pure algebra and relate it to various areas of logic and computer science. We believe that this research proposal is i n itself a testimonial to the successful effect of this funding through NSF ADVANCE. Gehrke has moved from a researcher in pure algebra to an interdisciplinary researcher working on problems in logic and computer science. The funding resulted in 15 papers . The awards have also sponsored work on a book on canonical extension. As a result, H. A. Priestley of the University of Oxford, an accomplished book author, and Gehrke are under contract to write an approximately 800 page book in the Oxford University Press Logic Guides Series, to be completed by December 2006. In addition, the funding resulted in Gehrke's attendance at numerous conferences, workshops, and a panel of the AWM on planning a career in mathematics (as panelist). The ability to travel, and to have time to work in the summer is what has allowed Gehrke to build new research collaborations, among others with Y. Venema, J. van Benthem, M. Dunn, J.F. Nilsson, H. Erne, and A. Pultr.

PI - Michele Nishiguchi Title - Assistant Professor (promoted to Associate Professor) Department - Biology, 2003 Type of Project - Travel , 2003 Title of Project - Evolutionary dynamics of a sepiolid squid -vibrio mutualism Travel funds were awarded to start collaborations with Dr. Gonzales Giribet, an Assistant Professor of Biology in the Department of Organismal and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. Information from this work has led to several new projects on sy stematics of invertebrates. Four journal publications have resulted from this research, as well as the creation of a website. 2002 Research - Environmental and ecological monitoring of symbiotic vibrio populations The project allows the investigators to e xamine the mechanisms that drive host -symbiont recognition, and assesses whether environmental factors or inherent genetic characters affect speciation and diversity among Vibrio bacteria. State of the art techniques, including fluorescent microscopy, molecular biology, and bioluminescence emission have been developed and used in our system. Central to this study was determining whether the genetic architecture of host -symbiont pairs was different between geographically isolated squid populations, and whe ther speciation among vibrio bacteria is driven by the differences among these distant populations. The project helped to shed light on whether the environment or host has greater selection for bacterial fitness. Additionally, a key element of the propos al was the study of the hosts and vibrio symbionts through several international and collaborative efforts that have previously been established by our laboratory. Results will be disseminated through various publications, meetings, websites and courses. T his program of study has also provided unique research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students at NMSU. Three journal publications, one book, and one website resulted from this research.

Appendix V Subaward Recipient L ists and Abstracts 21 PI - Delia J. Valles -Rosales Title - Assistant Professor Department - Industrial Engineering Type of Project - Research , 2005 Title of Project - Human Performance Modeling to Improve the Decision Making Process in Manufacturing Cells Valles -Rosales worked with her CoPI, Jeanine Cook, Ph.D., to propose a novel method to measure human performance metri cs and to understand how environmental factors such as lighting and noise level, ambient temperature, physical body postures required for working, as well as scheduled breaks for stress relieving and eating affected dexterity of operators performing repeti tive tasks at a local company. From the resulting analysis, it was found that dexterity degradation fluctuated during the day significantly in most operators. They were then able to prepare a scheduling plan to monitor dexterity on real time to help mana gement take immediate action to maintain stable levels of performance during the day. This research contributed to Valles -Rosales' opportunity to become tenured. Also, the team was assigned laboratory space with the option to grow in the future. This pr oject was a crucial element to enhance their chances for getting funding during summer time. The University of Texas at El Paso and Johnson Controls, Inc. were involved as partners in the project. PI - Nicole Vogt Title - Assistant Professor (promoted to Associate Professor) Department - Astronomy Type of Project - Research , 2004 Title of Project - The Formation of Disk Galleries Vogt is conducting a long -term observational and modeling program using the Keck Observatory of 10 - meter telescopes and the Hubble Space Telescope to quantify the degree and the form of evolution in the spiral galaxy population. The research grant allowed Vogt, peers at the California Institute for Technology and the University of California, Sant a Cruz, and three students to spend the summer doing data reduction and data analysis of local and distant galaxy images and spectra. The research gave way to five manuscripts. Additionally, the collaborations with peers in California are important given t heir leadership in the field and access to large private telescopes, which NMSU cannot access. Vogt is the winner of an NSF Career Award for Young Faculty. In the fall of 2008 Dr. Vogt built a complex simulator that reproduced the spatially resolved spect rum of a spiral galaxy at an arbitrary redshift, taking into account the instrumentation and atmospheric conditions at a specific observatory and projected galaxy evolution to \"the cosmology of your choice. And ADVANCE definitely had a hand (with building blocks) in getting me there!\" she reports.

Thursday, December 5, 2002 7:00 p.m., Chemistry 153, NMSU Campus General Lecture, \"Diabetes: Combating One of America's Heavyweights\" Diabetes is the fourth leading cause of death by disease in the U.S. resulting in an estimated $105B in health care costs annually. There are approximately 16 million diabetics in the United States. The most common form of diabetes mellitus is type 2 diabetes, als o referred to as non -insulin -dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It affects an estimated 15.3 million people, half of which are undiagnosed! Type 1 diabetes, also known as insulin -dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is an autoimmune disorder that affects ~ 700,000 people in the United States. To date, variety of drugs including sulfonylureas, biguanides, alpha -glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinedione and transition metal salts and compounds have been used to treat human beings and animals. Most of these dr ugs are potent compounds with some levels of toxicity associated with treatment as evidenced by the recent death of a participating subject in a clinical trial with a thiazolidinedione. The need for alternative treatments is obvious; maximizing efficacy and reducing the toxicity which seem to exist at some level for all these drugs, is the key for progress in this area. Dr. Crans's research group and that of hercollaborator Gail Willsky's, is investigating the possible use of transition metal complexes as potential treatment of diabetes. The advantages and disadvantages will be described and discussed along with the problems associated with development of new therapeutic agents. Topics include: Diabetes Appendix VI Visiting Professors 16 Metabolic Diseases When is someone diabetic? Curr ent treatment of Diabetes Steps in development of new treatments Regulatory aspects Animal Studies Human Studies What can you do? This seminar will be followed by a working reception during which attendees may address individual questions to Dr. Cran s. Friday, December 5, 2002 12:00 -2:00, New Mexico Room, Corbett Center This mini -workshop and luncheon will address issues that female students encounter when entering scientific endeavors at NMSU. Topics include: Choosing careers Areas of science Indiv idual meetings with Dr. Crans and interested students will also be arranged. APPENDIX V II: PUBLICATIONS Appendix VII Publications 2 N.P.
