It has a very high disease burden globally, leading to considerable morbidity and mortality 1,2. Annual influenza epidemics result in about 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness, and about 290,000 - 650,000 deaths worldwide (WHO report). Influenza appears in the community in two forms, annual epidemics or seasonal influenza, and occasional pandemics 3. Seasonal influenza occurs in the winter in both temperate climates of the northern and southern hemisphere. In the tropical regions, influenza occurs throughout the year and outbreaks are irregular (WHO report). The spread of seasonal influenza is quite rapid, especially in the crowded areas. Influenza is caused by a respiratory virus, so if an infected person coughs or sneezes, the infectious droplets are dispersed into the air and people in the vicinity are infected if they inhale these infectious droplets or even shaking hands with an infected person 4 (WHO report). Recently it has been shown that sneezing or coughing were not necessary for generating aerosols, only breathing was sufficient for aerosol generation and in turn transmission of influenza 5. Influenza virus has been detected from the air in settings like patients' rooms, health centers and emergency rooms 6-8. Recently, influenza viruses have also been detected in air especially in poultry farms 9,10. Influenza shows the highest attack rate in young people. Children display the highest morbidity associated with influenza. However, most mortality is reported in the older adult population. Along with the elderly population, the other groups in which disease symptoms are particularly severe are pregnant women, immune-compromised individuals and people with underlying chronic conditions like chronic lung diseases, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic disorders, cancer etc. 3,11. Hospitalizations and deaths especially occur in these high risk groups (WHO report). Disease symptoms and progression Seasonal influenza can range from asymptomatic disease to severe illness leading to complications. The severity of the infection is dependent on many factors like pathogenicity of the virus, age and genetic makeup of a person and also, if a person has some underlying immune-compromising conditions. Influenza disease can range from asymptomatic to severe with secondary complications. The disease symptoms of the seasonal influenza are evident after 1-2 days incubation of the virus in the host. They include sudden onset of fever, cough, headache, muscle and joint pain, sore throat and a runny nose (WHO report) 12,13. Fever peaks in the first 24 hours of onset, is usually between 38-41\u00b0C, and lasts for 1-5 days. Other physiological symptoms include flushed face, severe malaise, hot and moist skin, infected eyes. 13-15. Severe influenza related complications include pneumonia, Guillain-Barre syndrome, aseptic meningitis, cardiac complications, and Reye's syndrome 13-15. 1 Chapter 112epidemiology Influenza is one of the major respiratory diseases.

Seasonal epidemics are caused by IAV and IBVs. Influenza C viruses cause mild infections 13. IAV's are further classified depending on the surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). There are 18 HA and 11 NA subtypes. Influenza B has 2 distinct lineages, Victoria and Yamagata. Influenza viruses are enveloped with a lipid bilayer and have a single stranded, negative sense RNA genome17. An important characteristic of the influenza virus is that it has a segmented genome. It contains 8 genome segments (HA, NA, M, PA, PB1, PB2, NP , NS) coding for 10 proteins (HA, NA, M1 and M2, PA, PB1, PB2, NP , NS1 and NS2) (Figure 1). Some influenza viruses have up to 7 additional proteins along with the ones mentioned before. These are PB1-F2, N-40, PA-X, PA-N155, PA-N182, M42, NS3 18-20 (Figure 1). figure 1. Structure of the influenza virus 21. Figure on the left depicts the structure of influenza virus with 8 genome segments and also surface glycoproteins HA, NA and M2. On the right are the non-structural proteins and the newly fund proteins of influenza virus. Influenza virions have a roughly spherical shape and the diameter is 80-120 nm. Influenza virions are enveloped and contain glycoproteins HA, NA and M2 on the surface. HA (80%) is the most abundant protein on the envelope followed by NA (17%). M2 is present in very small quantity, 16-20 molecules per virion 22,23. Under the envelope there is the M1 protein which covers the viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) or the viral core. Each vRNP comprises three polymerase proteins: polymerase acidic (PA), polymerase basic 1 (PB1), polymerase basic 2 (PB2). The nucleoprotein (NP)-covered RNA forms a pan-handle structure which carries the polymerase complex at the end. 1 General introduction and scope of the thesis13Influenza virus Influenza is caused by the influenza virus which belongs to the family of Orthomyxoviridae , which is further subdivided into influenza A (IAV), B and C and now also D 16.

The nucleoprotein (NP)-covered RNA forms a pan-handle structure which carries the polymerase complex at the end. 1 Chapter 114RNA covered by NP forms a pan-handle structure which carries polymerase complex at its end 24. evolution of the influenza viruses There are mainly two types of mutations, antigenic drift and antigenic shift, that affect HA and NA which are important proteins for the induction of neutralizing antibodies (Figure 2). figure 2. Antigenic drift and shift of influenza viruses. It depicts antigenic drift and shift within hemagglutinin. Antigenic drift is shown by change in the colour of HA head from blue to green, while antigenic shift has been shown by change in the colour of complete HA from blue to orange. Antigenic drift RNA-polymerase of influenza lacks proof-reading activity which leads to addition of faulty nucleotides during replication of IAV's. This occurs at the rate of 10-3 to 10-4 substitutions/site, which results in high mutation rate 21,25. Accumulation of point mutations leads to a gradual change of the antigenic site of HA leading to antigenic drift (depicted in figure 2) 26. These changes impair and often prevent recognition and neutralization of this drifted virus by pre-existing neutralizing antibodies. The host immune system becomes no longer effective in protecting against this newly formed virus 25, which results in annual epidemics. Hence, to counter this, annually the flu vaccine is reformulated based on the circulating strains of that season in the northern and southern hemisphere, respectively. 1 Chapter 114RNA covered by NP forms a pan-handle structure which carries polymerase complex at its end 24. evolution of the influenza viruses There are mainly two types of mutations, antigenic drift and antigenic shift, that affect HA and NA which are important proteins for the induction of neutralizing antibodies (Figure 2). figure 2.

This phenomenon or type of mutation is termed 'antigenic shift' and it can lead to occasional pandemics causing unusually high morbidity and mortality. Until now the four major pandemics, 1918 H1N1 Spanish flu, 1957 H2N2, Asian flu, 1968 H3N2 Hong Kong flu and 2009 H1N1 Mexican flu pandemic, have been recorded 27-30. A pandemic virus can be produced by genetic re-assortment between avian and human IAVs. Usually, avian influenza viruses do not infect humans and vice versa. However, swine can act as a virus mixing vessel, leading to the generation of new influenza viruses, which can infect both humans and poultry. The classic example of such a virus is the H1N1 pandemic virus of 2009 31, which caused quite some havoc back then and is still in circulation now as a seasonal strain. These modifications in IAVs can be attributed to the factors like mechanistic errors during the replication of viral RNA polymerase, evolutionary pressure, novel environment of the host, immune pressure, or antiviral drug pressure 32. Vaccination Vaccination is the cornerstone for influenza control. It is the best strategy for prevention so far and is recommended by the WHO for elderly and populations at risk. The two types of influenza vaccine available are inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) and live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV). Historical overview The first influenza vaccine was produced in 1940's and it was an inactivated or \"killed\" virus vaccine which was monovalent containing only one influenza A strain, H1N1 33,34. With the discovery of influenza B strains, an inactivated bivalent vaccine was formulated, tested in humans and was licensed in the USA for use. With the emergence of a new strain, H3N2, in 1970, the vaccine was further adapted to consist of H1N1, H3N2 and one influenza B strain thereafter. This vaccine is termed as a trivalent influenza vaccine or a TIV 35. In 2009, FDA 1st considered including one more B strain to minimize the impact of IBV mismatch on vaccine effectiveness. In 2012 the WHO recommended the production of QIV's for the seasonal vaccination 36,37. Development of influenza vaccines is summarized in figure 3. 1 General introduction and scope of the thesis15Antigenic shift The segmented genome of influenza viruses facilitates exchange of genetic material (RNA) between the genotypically different influenza viruses, leading to formation of new or re-assorted IAV strain.

Influenza vaccine development from 1930's 38. Live attenuated influenza vaccines Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) has been in use in Russia from the 1970's 39. In 2003, an LAIV was licensed in the USA (not same one as in Russia) for the age-group 2-49 years and more recently this vaccine was approved in Europe, where it is recommended for children between 2-17 years of age 40,41. It is produced by reverse genetics using HA and NA of the circulating strains, while the backbone is an attenuated, temperature sensitive and cold-adapted influenza A or B virus strain. Because of the backbone, LAIV can replicate only at 33\u00b0C essentially restricting replication to the upper respiratory tract and is administered intranasally 42,43. Based on low vaccine effectiveness particularly against H1N1pdm09 in the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons,, LAIV was not recommended in the USA for the season of 2016-17 and the 2017-2018 season but the ban was lifted for the 2018-19 season 44. Inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) Inactivated influenza vaccines consist of whole inactivated virus influenza vaccines (WIV), split vaccines, subunit vaccines and virosomal or virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines. The components of these vaccines are depicted in Figure 3. WIV was the first applied influenza vaccine and has shown to have superior immunogenicity compared to corresponding split and subunit vaccines 45-48. However, due to local and systemic adverse reactions associated with WIV (like generalized aching and myalgia), WIV was replaced by much safer split and subunit vaccines 49-52. However, it has been thought that altered methods of formulating WIV could conquer these problems. WIV has regained attention again in context of universal influenza vaccines. Also, when WIV was given intranasally it has shown to induce cross-protection53,54. 1 Chapter 116figure 3. Influenza vaccine development from 1930's 38.

Co-circulation of B strains from 2 lineages (Victoria and Yamagata) has led to formulating quadrivalent influenza vaccines which contain viruses of both influenza B lineages 55. Identification of the circulating strains is coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO) international surveillance system and is used to predict virus strains putatively circulating in the coming season and thus to be included in the vaccine 56,57. figure 4. Components of different inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs) 55. WIV is prepared by inactivating the virus with chemicals like -propiolactone or formalin followed by purification. Virosomes are reconstructed influenza virus envelopes that contain of HA, NA and viral phospholipids. Virosomes retain viral membrane fusion and cell-binding capabilities due to their particulate nature, which in turn make them more immunogenic compared to subunit and split vaccines. Split vaccines are prepared by treatment with diethyl ether or detergent like ammonium deoxycholate which disassociates the viral envelope exposing all virus proteins. To make subunit vaccine, which consists of HA and NA proteins, further purification is done after diethyl ether treatment 58. 1 General introduction and scope of the thesis17Current influenza vaccines Current or seasonal trivalent influenza vaccines (TIVs) comprise of either inactivated or live attenuated antigens of influenza strains (H1N1, H3N2 and influenza B strain) that are antigenically similar to the circulating strains 55.

There are also cell culture based vaccines available in the market. However with problems associated with egg based influenza production, in 2012, the U.S. FDA approved cell culture based trivalent inactivated Flucelvax\u00ae vaccine to be used in people of age 18 and above 59,60(CDC website). In 2016, quadrivalent inactivated Flucelvax\u00ae was approved for the people of age 4 and older. In Europe, one of the 1st commercialized seasonal cell culture based vaccines was Optaflu\u00ae 59,60. Flublok\u00ae is an insect cell based influenza vaccine, now available in the market in the USA. It is a trivalent recombinant hemagglutinin based VLP vaccine which is produced in insect cell culture using the baculovirus expression system 61,62. Limitations of current influenza vaccines Current seasonal vaccines could be associated with the problem of low immunogenicity, especially in children, elderly and immune-compromised populations. Accordingly, vaccine effectiveness is modest when there is an antigenic mismatch between the vaccine strains and the circulating strains. Moreover, inactivated vaccines administered via parenteral route induce mainly systemic immune responses and very low or no mucosal immune responses 63,64. As influenza virus is mainly transmitted via airways and replicates in the airway epithelium, restricting the infection at the portal of entry would be advantageous 65,66. Additionally, IgA antibodies induced by mucosal vaccines have been shown to be more cross- reactive than IgG antibodies and provide cross-protection against antigenically drifted influenza viruses 67,68. There are a lot of studies done on intranasal administration of influenza vaccines; however LAIV is the only intranasal vaccine that made it to the market. Alternatively, lungs would be an excellent mucosal area for targeting influenza vaccines as lungs are large and contain a large number of antigen presenting cells 64,69. Apart from immunogenicity problems associated with current influenza vaccines, stability is also an issue 70. Current vaccines are mainly administered in aqueous form and are prone to degradation if the cold chain is disturbed 71. If a vaccine that has undergone conformational changes is administered, it can induce lower immune responses. Hence improving stability of current influenza vaccines is a must. One of the ways is to make dry vaccine formulations by sugar-glass technology. Dry powder vaccines are less prone to degradation by temperature changes than liquid formulations 72,73. Some dry powder influenza vaccine formulations have been shown to be suitable for pulmonary administration in pre-clinical studies in mice, cotton rats and chickens 74-76 and the results are quite promising. 1 Chapter 118Influenza vaccine production is mainly done using embryonated chicken eggs and is a laborious and time consuming process taking about 6 months.

It is a trivalent recombinant hemagglutinin based VLP vaccine which is produced in insect cell culture using the baculovirus expression system 61,62. Limitations of current influenza vaccines Current seasonal vaccines could be associated with the problem of low immunogenicity, especially in children, elderly and immune-compromised populations. Accordingly, vaccine effectiveness is modest when there is an antigenic mismatch between the vaccine strains and the circulating strains. Moreover, inactivated vaccines administered via parenteral route induce mainly systemic immune responses and very low or no mucosal immune responses 63,64. As influenza virus is mainly transmitted via airways and replicates in the airway epithelium, restricting the infection at the portal of entry would be advantageous 65,66. Additionally, IgA antibodies induced by mucosal vaccines have been shown to be more cross- reactive than IgG antibodies and provide cross-protection against antigenically drifted influenza viruses 67,68. There are a lot of studies done on intranasal administration of influenza vaccines; however LAIV is the only intranasal vaccine that made it to the market. Alternatively, lungs would be an excellent mucosal area for targeting influenza vaccines as lungs are large and contain a large number of antigen presenting cells 64,69. Apart from immunogenicity problems associated with current influenza vaccines, stability is also an issue 70. Current vaccines are mainly administered in aqueous form and are prone to degradation if the cold chain is disturbed 71. If a vaccine that has undergone conformational changes is administered, it can induce lower immune responses. Hence improving stability of current influenza vaccines is a must. One of the ways is to make dry vaccine formulations by sugar-glass technology. Dry powder vaccines are less prone to degradation by temperature changes than liquid formulations 72,73. Some dry powder influenza vaccine formulations have been shown to be suitable for pulmonary administration in pre-clinical studies in mice, cotton rats and chickens 74-76 and the results are quite promising. 1 General introduction and scope of the thesis19The main problem associated with the currently available influenza vaccines is that they can provide only strain specific immunity 55. The seasonal vaccines depend on the induction of neutralizing antibodies against the globular head of HA of the virus strains present in vaccine. These antibodies fail to neutralize any mismatched HA that is not part of the flu strains in the vaccine. This makes it necessary to reformulate the vaccine every year depending on the circulating strains. Also, these seasonal vaccines fail to provide protection against newly emerging influenza strains with pandemic potential. Hence, universal or broadly protective influenza vaccines are needed. Universal influenza vaccine candidates There are many vaccine candidates that are in the pipeline for the generation of broadly protective vaccines. Conserved influenza proteins like nucleoprotein (NP), matrix protein 1 (M1) or the stem domain of HA are ideal targets for inducing broadly protective immunity 55,77. Initially, it was believed that T cells that are induced against these proteins are the main correlates of cross-reactive immune response, in particular tissue resident CD8+ T cells 78,79. But along with cross-reactive T cells, currently non- neutralizing antibodies are also getting attention for being cross-reactive. They possibly mediate cross-protection via pathways like antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity or antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis, which currently are hot topics in the field of universal influenza vaccines. Inducing cross-reactive T cells Influenza infection can generate T cells that target epitopes derived from highly conserved internal proteins of influenza virus in mice and humans 80,81. These cross- reactive T cells have been shown to mediate heterosubtypic protection in mice. Studies have shown that the targets of T cells are mainly NP , M1 and PB1 80,82,83. CD8 or cytotoxic T cells can clear influenza virus infected cells and curb the virus from spreading 77. Even though cell mediated immunity declines by ~6 months after primary infection, a large number of memory cells is still present and has been found in animals for about 2 years 84. There are a number of studies which describe the importance of cross-reactive T cells in context of broad-protection from influenza in humans 82,83,85. Hence, targeting T cell memory with vaccines would be a promising approach to elicit broad-protection against influenza viruses. Although the protective role of CD8 T cells has been studied more in context of universal influenza vaccines, the protective role of CD4 T cells is gaining as much attention 82,86. It has been shown that without B cells or CD8 T cells, HA- specific CD4 T cells can protect a na\u00efve host from influenza infection 87, 88. CD4 T cells can target conserved M2e of influenza to induce heterosubtypic protection 89. There are several T cell based universal influenza vaccine candidates evaluated in clinical trials . 1 General introduction and scope of the thesis19The main problem associated with the currently available influenza vaccines is that they can provide only strain specific immunity 55.

These antibodies have very limited cross-reactive potential and fail to elicit heterosubtypic protection. However, broadly neutralizing antibodies have been identified from influenza infected or vaccinated individuals during last decade, although they seem to be present in low amounts. The stem of HA contains a conserved region and antibodies targeting this region are often capable of neutralizing one or both influenza A subgroups. Recombinant vaccines can induce these antibodies directed against HA stalk. Studies with influenza vaccine consisting of chimeric HA or recombinant headless HA2 protein expressed on VLP's have shown to induce these antibodies 98. Apart from HA, NA and M2 have also been shown to be targets for the broadly neutralizing antibodies 99,100. The highly conserved extracellular domain of M2, M2e, has been the most attractive target for universal influenza vaccine design 89,101. Strategies to elicit these antibodies include sequential vaccination with antigenically distinct vaccines, use of adjuvant, different prime-boost strategies, multivalent approaches and vaccination with glycan-modified antigens, vaccination with minimal antigens and 102,103. Alternative to the mechanism of direct neutralization, there are other non-neutralizing Fc receptor dependent mechanisms such as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and also complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). These effector mechanisms are recruited by anti-HA, anti-NA and anti-M2e antibodies 72,104-109. ADCC is important in a sense that it can induce protection in vivo mediated by stalk specific antibodies. Protection conferred by M2e based vaccines has also been shown to be mediated by ADCC 110,111. Passive transfer of these antibodies in humans have shown to reduce clinical symptoms 112. 1 Chapter 120Table 1.

In the 1st part of this thesis we focus on different vaccination strategies or delivery systems to achieve broad-protection. Further we tried to elucidate which immune mechanisms these vaccines target. In the second part of this thesis we describe the cotton rat model in context of influenza vaccine evaluation and its suitability for pulmonary administration of dry powder and liquid vaccine formulations. Whole inactivated virus influenza vaccines (WIV) are capable of inducing cross- protection to some extent however it's limited. Adjuvants and different routes of vaccination would be an interesting way to enhance cross-protection induced by WIV. In Chapter 2 , we compared liposome and protein based adjuvants along with whole inactivated virus (WIV) influenza vaccines in a head to head comparison setting to assess if one or more adjuvanted vaccine candidates could confer broadly protective immunity. Also, mechanisms of cross-protection were assessed for those adjuvanted vaccines which performed the best in the head-to head comparison. Sequential infection with antigenically distinct influenza viruses can provide cross-protection. However not a lot of research is done on sequential vaccination for the induction of cross-protection. In Chapter 3, we assessed whether sequential immunization with antigenically distinct influenza vaccines could also provide cross- protection, in how far the form of the vaccine, whole inactivated virus vaccine (WIV) or subunit vaccine (SU), impacts on this capacity, and which immune mechanisms are involved. Cytotoxic T cells directed against conserved proteins of influenza like NP have been shown to induce cross-protection. However, NP on its own inadequately activates antigen presenting cells leading to low induction of CTLs. This problem could be solved using influenza virosomes. In Chapter 6, we developed a novel influenza vaccine consisting of virosomes with the Toll-like receptor 4 ligand, monophosphoryl lipid A, and the metal-ion-chelating lipid DOGS-NTA-Ni incorporated in the membrane. It contains nucleoprotein of influenza which is a conserved internal influenza antigen that can induce cross-reactive cytotoxic T cells. Mice and ferrets are used for pre-clinical influenza vaccine evaluation. However both have some advantages and disadvantages. Hence there is a need of a small animal model for influenza vaccine evaluation. In Chapter 4, we describe the introduction of the cotton rat model in our laboratory and what are the pros and cons of using cotton rat model for influenza vaccine evaluation. Vaccine administration to the lungs is an attractive alternative to parenteral vaccine administration, as it can induce mucosal immune responses along with systemic immune responses. In Chapter 5, we studied pulmonary delivery of WIV 1 General introduction and scope of the thesis21Scope of this thesis There are several strategies that can lead us towards broadly protective and improved influenza vaccines.

Using WIV as basis we assessed the relative efficacy of different adjuvants by carrying out a head-to-head comparison of the protein-based adjuvants CTA1-DD and CTA1-3M2e-DD and evaluated whether one or more of the adjuvants could induce broadly protective immunity. Mice were immunized with WIV prepared from A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) virus intramuscularly with or without CAF09, CTA1-DD or CTA1-3M2e-DD, followed by challenge with homologous, heterologous or heterosubtypic virus. In general, intranasal immunizations were significantly more effective than intramuscular vaccines afforded strong cross-protection with milder clinical symptoms and better control of virus load in lungs. Mechanistic studies indicated that non-neutralizing IgG antibodies and CD4 T cells were responsible for the improved cross-protection while IgA antibodies were dispensable. The best cross-protection was stimulated by CAF09 and CTA1-3M2e-DD, with CTA1-3M2e-DD also providing CD4 T cell-dependent reduction of lung virus titers.

They do not provide strong heterosubtypic immunity against strains not included in the vaccine.1,2 Moreover, antigenic drift regularly leads to the emergence of new strains that are responsible for recurrent epidemics, while zoonotic influenza viruses pose a serious pandemic threat, such as pandemic H1N1(2009) and the potentially pandemic H5N1, H7N9, H10N8 or H5N6.3-6 There is therefore an urgent need for universal or broadly protective vaccines against influenza. Whole inactivated virus (WIV) vaccines contain all viral proteins and retain the conformation of native virus particles and as such make a promising basis for an influenza vaccine. Moreover, WIV has an intrinsic ability to activate innate immune responses, e.g. antigen presenting cells via Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) signaling.7 Although WIV was the first vaccine to be used, it was later replaced by split and subunit vaccines that were considered safer8, despite WIV being superior at inducing immune responses in mice and na\u00efve human beings.7,9 -12 Interest has recently refocused on WIV vaccines as studies have shown them capable of inducing a certain degree of cross- protection upon parenteral and mucosal vaccination.3,13-16 However, a large amount of antigen was required to achieve protection and/or virus challenge was only performed shortly after immunization in these studies.16 One approach to reduce the dose of WIV needed would be to use adjuvants that might also improve the breadth of the immune responses. 17-19 In this study, we compared the liposome-based adjuvants CAF09 CTA1-3M2e-DD, since these adjuvants have previously been successfully used with several vaccine candidates, including influenza vaccines.20,21,30-37,22-29 The cationic adjuvant formulations, CAF01 and CAF09, are liposomes as an immunomodulator stabilized and additional immunomodulator.20,31 CAF01 and CAF09 have been shown to generate strong T cell and antibody responses, with particularly high IgG2a responses for CAF01.20,21,28 CAF09 is furthermore capable of inducing potent CD8+ T cell responses against protein and peptide based antigens.24,28,31 CAF01 can be administered parenterally while CAF09 is mainly administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) or used as mucosal adjuvant. CTA1-DD is a fusion protein consisting of the enzymatically active A1 subunit of cholera toxin and a dimer of an Ig binding element from Staphylococcus aureus protein A.

It targets cells of 2 Chapter 234the innate immune system which results in strongly enhanced humoral and cellular immune responses.34-36 Contrary to whole cholera toxin the mucosal CTA1-DD adjuvant is safe and non-toxic as found in non-human primates and it does not accumulate in the olfactory bulb and nerve following administration intranasally (i.n.) and, hence, cannot cause Bell's palsy.38 CTA1-3M2e-DD harbors an insert of three copies of the exterior domain of the M2 protein of influenza virus, M2e.33,37 We compared these adjuvants head-to-head to assess their relative potency in stimulating cross-reactive and cross-protective anti-influenza immunity in with or without the different adjuvants and 2 weeks after the final immunization mice were challenged with homologous PR8, heterologous A(H1N1)pdm09 or heterosubtypic X-31 virus to assess protection and several immune parameters. We observed that WIV administered i.n. with the mucosal adjuvants conferred much stronger cross- protection than parenterally administered WIV with or without adjuvant. Studies into the significance of different immune mechanisms for protection revealed that non- neutralizing serum antibodies and CD4 T cells were important for cross-protection while IgA, even when present in high levels, did not play a critical role. Thus, WIV administered i.n. in combination with effective mucosal adjuvants provided the strongest cross-protection against heterosubtypic influenza virus infections and appears to be a promising candidate for a broadly protective influenza vaccine.

Whole inactivated virus vaccines (WIV) were prepared from these viruses and inactivated using beta- propiolactone. The WIV HA content (\u00b5g/ml) was determined by using Lowry protein assay and SDS-PAGE (colloidal blue staining) to establish total protein content and percentage HA respectively, the HA content was then calculated. Quality and quantity of HA were confirmed by single radial immunodiffusion assay. 39 Adjuvants The liposomal adjuvants CAF01 and CAF09 produced as described previously.40 The dose for both adjuvants was 300 \u00b5g per 50 \u00b5l for i.m. and 300 \u00b5g per 40 \u00b5l for i.n. administration.

Adjuvant comparison study. Female C57Bl/6 x Balb/c F1 (CB6F1) mice aged 6-8 weeks were purchased from Envigo (The Netherlands). The mice were distributed randomly and housed in groups of six within individually ventilated cages (IVC) at the animal facility, receiving standard water and diet. Group sizes were determined using Piface software aiming at a power of 80%. Mice were vaccinated three times with 0.5 \u00b5g HA of PR8 (with or without the adjuvants) on days 0, 10 and 20 as described in Table 1. Mice from groups 1-3 received 50 \u00b5l PBS or vaccine i.m., 25 \u00b5l per hindlimb. Mice from groups 4-7 received respective vaccines i.n. in a volume of 40 \u00b5l, divided between the two nostrils. Vaccination and virus challenge were carried out under Isoflurane/O2 anesthesia. Three weeks after the 3rd vaccination (day 41), six mice from each group (of 18) were sacrificed to determine vaccine-induced immune responses. The remaining mice were challenged with 104.4 TCID50/mouse of homologous PR8 virus, 103.3 of X-31 (titers were chosen on the basis of titration experiments in CB6F1 mice). Six mice from each experimental group were sacrificed on day 3 post challenge to assess protection against virus replication in the lungs. The remaining six mice were observed until day 10 post challenge to assess clinical symptoms such as weight loss, ruffled fur and activity. The humane endpoint was set to a loss of >20% of the original weight from the day of challenge. Additionally, for the mechanistic experiments, a score sheet was used to follow the animals. Parameters such as weight loss, appearance (degree of ruffled fur, hunched back) and behavior of the animals (slow movements, difficulty in walking, circling, response to external stimulus) were recorded. These parameters were given scores from 1-4 for least to most severe.

Six animals/group were sacrificed on day three post challenge for assessment of lung virus titers while the remaining animals were followed for 14 days for clinical symptoms using the scoring system described above. IgA knockout experiment. IgA knock-out mice (IgA KO; Balb/c background, males and females) were obtained from Margaret Conner, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, US and bred at EBM in Gothenburg, Sweden. The mice were immunized as described in Table 1, groups 1, 4, 5 and 7 and challenged with X-31 virus on day 41. Female Balb/c mice were used as wild-type (wt) controls.

Mice from positive control group received serum samples from mice immunized with PR8 WIV and challenged with PR8 live virus. Animals were followed for 14 days and clinical symptoms were assessed using the scoring system described above. CD4 T cell depletion. Anti-CD4 antibody (200 \u00b5g/injection, clone GK 1.5 (Bioceros, Utrecht, The Netherlands)) was used for in vivo CD4 depletion, which was assessed by staining with FITC-labeled anti-CD4 (clone RM 4.4, Thermo Scientific).

Nasal and lung washes were taken using 1 ml PBS (pH 7.4) with Complete\u00ae protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Almere, The Netherlands) for determining IgA titers. Lungs were collected in 1 ml complete EPISERF medium (100 U/ml penicillin, 100mg/ml streptomycin, 12.5 ml of 1 M HEPES, 5 ml of 7.5% sodium bicarbonate for 500 ml medium, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bleisweijk, The Netherlands) for determination of viral load. Spleens were collected in 1 ml Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bleisweijk, 2-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen, Breda, The Netherlands) to assess cellular immune responses. lung virus titration Virus titration was performed as described previously.41 Briefly, the lungs were homogenized in 1 ml EPISERF medium and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 minutes to collect the supernatant. These supernatants were used to infect MDCK cells with serial two fold dilutions of the lung supernatants to determine lung virus titers as described before.41 Viral titers are presented as log10 titer of 50% tissue culture infectious dose per gram of lung. Limit of detection (LoD) was determined by calculating the log10 of the 1st dilution and the negative values were given half the value of the LoD. Assessment of antibody responses were determined in blood serum samples taken on day 41, i.e. the day of challenge. IgA was determined in mucosal samples immediately after sample collection. ELISAs were performed as described previously using WIV prepared from each of the challenge viruses, subunit vaccine prepared from X-31, NP protein, or M2e protein for coating.42 To determine the serum antibodies were (cross-) virus as described previously.43 LoD for IgG was determined by calculating the log10 of the 1st dilution while LoD for MN titers was calculated using Log2 of the 1st dilution.

Multifunctional T cell assay To assess the contribution of influenza-specific T cells in protection, a multifunctional T cell assay was performed which involved staining for intracellular cytokines CD3+CD8+ T lymphocytes. All reagents, buffers and antibodies were purchased from eBioscience, The Netherlands. Spleens collected in IMDM were immediately processed and single cell suspensions were obtained using GentleMACS C tubes and GentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec, Leiden, The Netherlands). Cell suspensions forced through a cell strainer (BD Bioscience, Breda, The 0.1mM EDTA). Cells X-31 (University Medical Center Leiden, The Netherlands) in the presence of co-stimulatory anti-CD28 antibody for 16 hours. For each mouse, non-stimulated control cells were used to measure the baseline expression of the cytokines. After 12 hours of incubation, protein transport inhibitor (Thermo Scientific, The Netherlands) was added to stop the transport of proteins out of the Golgi apparatus. Cell stimulation cocktail containing PMA-ionomycin (Thermo Scientific, The Netherlands) was used as a positive control stimulant. Next day, cells were washed once with FACS buffer and stained for surface markers (anti-CD3-Alexa- fluor 700, anti-CD4-FITC, anti-CD8a PerCP-efluor720, all purchased from Thermo Scientific, The Netherlands) for 45 minutes at 4\u00b0C, followed by rinsing with cold PBS and staining with the fixable viability dye eFluor 780 for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C. After two washes with FACS buffer, cells were fixed with fixation buffer and then permeabilized with FACS permeabilization buffer (Thermo anti-IL4 APC, Thermo Scientific) were added to the cells and incubated for 45 minutes. Ultracomp beads (Thermo Scientific, The Netherlands) were used to prepare compensation controls. Events were acquired on an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software (Tree Star) was used for analysis.

(GraphPad Sofware, La Jolla, USA www.graphpad.com ) ReSUlTS WIV combined with mucosal adjuvants provides best cross-protection In order to determine the relative efficacy of WIV vaccines combined with different adjuvants, mice were vaccinated three times via the most suitable route of administration with WIV derived from PR8 virus alone or mixed with CAF01, CAF09, CTA1-DD or CTA1-3M2e-DD, followed by homologous, heterologous or heterosubtypic virus challenge. To assess the protective efficacy of the tested vaccines, challenged mice were observed for weight loss and clinical symptoms for a period of 10 days or until they reached defined humane endpoint. Percent weight loss was calculated (Fig. 1a-1c) and survival curves were plotted (Fig. 1d-f). Furthermore, to assess viral loads in the lungs, mock vaccinated and WIV vaccinated animals were sacrificed three days after homologous, heterologous or heterosubtypic virus challenge (Fig. 1g-i). All mock immunized mice reached the humane endpoint (>20% weight loss) and were sacrificed by day 6 post challenge with PR/8. Mice from all groups immunized three times with WIV, with or without adjuvants, were protected from weight loss post challenge with homologous PR8 virus (Fig. 1a, 1d). Furthermore, all but one (with low titer) of the vaccinated mice were completely protected from virus replication in the lungs (Fig. 1g). Mock immunized animals gradually lost weight and had to be sacrificed upon reaching the humane endpoint by day 6 or 7 post challenge with heterologous A/ California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 virus. Animals vaccinated with non-adjuvanted WIV i.m. showed some weight loss but all survived until the end of the study. Surprisingly, mice immunized i.m. with CAF01 adjuvanted vaccine lost more weight and 2 out of 6 mice had to be sacrificed (Fig.1b, 1e). Animals vaccinated with WIV i.n. exhibited little weight loss except for one animal which reached the humane endpoint on day 5 post challenge. Mice vaccinated with WIV plus mucosal adjuvants presented the best cross- protection against heterologous virus challenge: they showed little or no weight loss and all animals survived to day 10 post challenge (Fig.1b, 1e). Although not significant, lung virus titers were somewhat higher in well protected than in unprotected, mock- immunized mice (Fig. 1h). In the heterosubtypic X-31 challenge experiment, all animals, whether vaccinated or not, initially showed a similar trend in weight loss (Fig.1c).

CTA1-DD and CTA1-3M2e-DD adjuvanted vaccines afforded the largest reduction in lung viral titers (Fig. 1i). Thus, i.n. immunization with CAF09, CTA1-DD or CTA1-3M2e-DD adjuvanted WIV stimulated significantly broader protection compared to systemic immunizations with WIV alone or WIV plus i.m. CAF01 adjuvant. Immuno-profiling reveals strong correlation between survival and serum antibodies, mucosal IgA and I fn+ CD4 T cells To determine which immune mechanisms correlated with the observed cross- protection and to what degree these mechanisms would differ for the different adjuvanted vaccines, various immunological assays were performed. Sera, nasal and lung washes were collected three weeks after the 3rd immunization for antibody titer assessments, while T cell responses against heterologous A(H1N1)pdm09 and heterosubtypic X-31 virus were determined using spleens of vaccinated animals three days post heterosubtypic challenge. The results of immunoprofiling for the heterologous and heterosubtypic challenge experiments are summarized as heatmaps (Fig. 2a, b) to reveal patterns which correlate with protection; the individual data can be found in the supplementary information (Fig. S1 -S5). Immunization with PR8 WIV i.m. reliably induced neutralizing antibodies against the homologous virus, especially when administered with adjuvant (Fig. S1a). By contrast, i.n. immunizations poorly stimulated neutralizing antibodies, even in the presence of adjuvants. Importantly, we found no neutralizing antibodies against heterologous A(H1N1)pdm09 or heterosubtypic X-31 virus irrespective of the immunization route or adjuvant used (Fig. 2a- b, Fig. S1b, c). However, all immunized mice developed serum IgG antibodies reactive with homologous, as well as heterologous and heterosubtypic virus and these titers were of identical magnitude for all three virus strains (Fig. 2a- b, Fig S1d-f). The addition of both IgG1 and IgG2a. CTA1-DD and CTA1-3M2e- DD were comparatively less effective in stimulating IgG and IgG1 and had only minor effects on IgG2a levels (Fig. 2a-b, Fig. S2a-b). Furthermore, we wanted to identify the antigens targeted by the cross-reactive IgG. Use of subunit vaccine for coating revealed that vaccine-evoked, cross-reactive antibodies readily bound to viral surface proteins.

Importantly, we found no neutralizing antibodies against heterologous A(H1N1)pdm09 or heterosubtypic X-31 virus irrespective of the immunization route or adjuvant used (Fig. 2a- b, Fig. S1b, c). However, all immunized mice developed serum IgG antibodies reactive with homologous, as well as heterologous and heterosubtypic virus and these titers were of identical magnitude for all three virus strains (Fig. 2a- b, Fig S1d-f). The addition of both IgG1 and IgG2a. CTA1-DD and CTA1-3M2e- DD were comparatively less effective in stimulating IgG and IgG1 and had only minor effects on IgG2a levels (Fig. 2a-b, Fig. S2a-b). Furthermore, we wanted to identify the antigens targeted by the cross-reactive IgG. Use of subunit vaccine for coating revealed that vaccine-evoked, cross-reactive antibodies readily bound to viral surface proteins. These antibodies were found in all 2 WIV and mucosal adjuvants as broadly protective flu vaccines41mice immunized i.m., but were present in mice immunised i.n. only when adjuvanted vaccine was used (Fig. 2a, b, Fig. S2c). Anti-NP antibodies were detected only in mice vaccinated with WIV plus CAF01 and one mouse from the WIV plus CAF09 group (Fig. 2a, b, S2d). Anti-M2e antibodies were induced only by WIV adjuvanted with CTA1-3M2e- DD (Fig. 2a, b, Fig. S2e). Vaccination, especially when done with adjuvanted vaccines, therefore induced cross-reactive antibodies which mainly targeted the viral surface proteins. The levels of these antibodies correlated with protection from severe disease, except in the group with CAF01-adjuvanted vaccine delivered i.m. Determination of influenza specific mucosal IgA revealed that mice from the PBS control group as well as mice immunized i.m. with non-adjuvanted or CAF01- adjuvanted WIV developed no or very low mucosal IgA responses (in nose and lungs) against any of the viruses (Fig. 2a, b, Fig. S3 a, b, c). In contrast, all miceimmunized i.n. with adjuvanted WIV produced significant levels of specific IgA antibodies in both nose and lungs against all three virus strains, and these levels were significantly higher than in mice immunized i.n. with non-adjuvanted WIV. Therefore, mucosal immunization in the presence of adjuvant was required for successful induction of cross-reactive mucosal IgA (Fig. 2a, b, Fig. S3 a, b, c). IgA titers strongly correlated with protection from weight loss (Fig. 2a, b). We next assessed vaccine-induced T cell responses. In vitro re-stimulation of splenocytes with heterologous or heterosubtypic immunized i.n. with non-adjuvanted WIV developed no or very low levels of IFN-producing CD4 T cells. Mice immunized i.n. with adjuvanted WIV demonstrated enhancement of IFN-producing cells, with CTA1-3M2e-DD being most potent. In addition to IFN, we also measured IL2 and TNF responses in CD4+ T cells, but although restimulation with WIV and peptides increased the numbers of T cells producing these cytokines, the percentages were low and no significant differences between immunized and mock-immunized animals were observed (results not shown). The large majority of vaccine-specific CD4 T cells produced IFN, while very few cells were multifunctional, also producing other cytokines (Fig. S5). In contrast to CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells were not induced in significant numbers by any of the vaccines (Fig. 2a, b, Fig. S4c, d). In conclusion, IFN-producing CD4 T cells were the only T cell population induced and their numbers were enhanced significantly by adjuvanted WIV administered i.n. Protection from weight loss correlated well with the number of IFN- producing CD4 T cells (Fig. 2a, b, Fig. S4a, b). Dissecting the mechanisms of protection From the heatmaps it can be deduced that protection from heterologous and heterosubtypic virus challenge correlated with serum IgG antibody titers (with the exception of the CAF01 group), mucosal IgA, and CD4 T cells. We next performed a 2 WIV and mucosal adjuvants as broadly protective flu vaccines41mice immunized i.m., but were present in mice immunised i.n. only when adjuvanted vaccine was used (Fig. 2a, b, Fig. S2c). Anti-NP antibodies were detected only in mice vaccinated with WIV plus CAF01 and one mouse from the WIV plus CAF09 group (Fig. 2a, b, S2d). Anti-M2e antibodies were induced only by WIV adjuvanted with CTA1-3M2e- DD (Fig. 2a, b, Fig. S2e). Vaccination, especially when done with adjuvanted vaccines, therefore induced cross-reactive antibodies which mainly targeted the viral surface proteins. The levels of these antibodies correlated with protection from severe disease, except in the group with CAF01-adjuvanted vaccine delivered i.m. Determination of influenza specific mucosal IgA revealed that mice from the PBS control group as well as mice immunized i.m. with non-adjuvanted or CAF01- adjuvanted WIV developed no or very low mucosal IgA responses (in nose and lungs) against any of the viruses (Fig. 2a, b, Fig. S3 a, b, c). In contrast, all miceimmunized i.n. with adjuvanted WIV produced significant levels of specific IgA antibodies in both nose and lungs against all three virus strains, and these levels were significantly higher than in mice immunized i.n. with non-adjuvanted WIV. Therefore, mucosal immunization in the presence of adjuvant was required for successful induction of cross-reactive mucosal IgA (Fig. 2a, b, Fig. S3 a, b, c). IgA titers strongly correlated with protection from weight loss (Fig. 2a, b). We next assessed vaccine-induced T cell responses. In vitro re-stimulation of splenocytes with heterologous or heterosubtypic immunized i.n. with non-adjuvanted WIV developed no or very low levels of IFN-producing CD4 T cells. Mice immunized i.n. with adjuvanted WIV demonstrated enhancement of IFN-producing cells, with CTA1-3M2e-DD being most potent. In addition to IFN, we also measured IL2 and TNF responses in CD4+ T cells, but although restimulation with WIV and peptides increased the numbers of T cells producing these cytokines, the percentages were low and no significant differences between immunized and mock-immunized animals were observed (results not shown). The large majority of vaccine-specific CD4 T cells produced IFN, while very few cells were multifunctional, also producing other cytokines (Fig. S5). In contrast to CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells were not induced in significant numbers by any of the vaccines (Fig. 2a, b, Fig. S4c, d). In conclusion, IFN-producing CD4 T cells were the only T cell population induced and their numbers were enhanced significantly by adjuvanted WIV administered i.n. Protection from weight loss correlated well with the number of IFN- producing CD4 T cells (Fig. 2a, b, Fig. S4a, b). Dissecting the mechanisms of protection From the heatmaps it can be deduced that protection from heterologous and heterosubtypic virus challenge correlated with serum IgG antibody titers (with the exception of the CAF01 group), mucosal IgA, and CD4 T cells. We next performed a 2 Chapter 242series of experiments in order to determine whether any of these factors was critical for protection from heterosubtypic virus infection. For these experiments we focused on CAF09 and CTA1-3M2e-DD as the most successful adjuvants from the previous experiment and used PBS and non-adjuvanted WIV as controls. To assess if serum antibodies can mediate cross-protection, mice were passively immunized via the i.p. route with serum collected from animals which had been mock- immunized with PBS or immunized with WIV, WIV+CAF09 or WIV+CTA1-3M2e-DD i.n. One day later they were challenged with heterosubtypic X-31 virus. Animals which received PR8 immune serum followed by a homologous challenge with PR8 virus served as positive control group. Mice were observed daily for clinical symptoms using the score sheet described previously. We found that PR8 immune serum completely protected mice against PR8 virus infection. Serum from mice immunized i.n. with PR8 WIV without adjuvant did not provide protection against infection with heterosubtypic X-31 virus and the mice transfused with this serum exhibited high clinical scores and reduced survival (Fig. 3a, b). By contrast, serum from mice immunized with WIV plus CAF09 or CTA1-3M2e-DD protected partially and clinical scores were reduced by 50% compared to unimmunised control mice. Thus, non-neutralizing serum IgG WIV appeared to partially protect against heterosubtypic X-31 virus challenge. Next, we studied the role of CD4+ T cells in protection. Depletion of CD4 T cells was achieved through anti-CD4 Mab-treatment of mice and resulted in reduction of CD4 T cell numbers in peripheral blood by >95% (data not shown). We found that CD4 depletion did not affect survival (Fig. 4b-d) or clinical scores (Fig. 4e-h) upon X-31 virus infection in the well immunized animals. Yet, CD4 T cell depletion had a significant effect on lung virus titers in animals immunized with WIV and CTA1-3M2e-DD while all other immunization protocols showed comparable lung virus titers irrespective of CD4 depletion (Fig. 4i). Therefore, CD4 T cells appeared to play a role in protection against heterobsubtypic challenge only in the CTA1-3M2e-DD group. Finally, we addressed whether cross-reactive local IgA antibodies impacted on protection against infection in the mice immunized i.n. by repeating the immunization/ challenge experiment in IgA KO mice. In line with reports in literature, we found that mock-immunized IgA KO mice were more susceptible to influenza infection than mock- immunized wt Balb/c mice, demonstrated by higher clinical scores post challange.45 Wild-type Balb/c mice immunized with non-adjuvanted WIV demonstrated reduced clinical scores as compared to non-immunized Balb/c mice but this was not the case for IgA KO mice indicating a role for IgA in protection. (Fig. 5a, e) (Fig. 5b, f). When immunized with WIV and any of the mucosal adjuvants, wt and IgA KO mice developed protective immunity and survived the challenge infection (Fig.5c, d, g, h). 2 Chapter 242series of experiments in order to determine whether any of these factors was critical for protection from heterosubtypic virus infection. For these experiments we focused on CAF09 and CTA1-3M2e-DD as the most successful adjuvants from the previous experiment and used PBS and non-adjuvanted WIV as controls. To assess if serum antibodies can mediate cross-protection, mice were passively immunized via the i.p. route with serum collected from animals which had been mock- immunized with PBS or immunized with WIV, WIV+CAF09 or WIV+CTA1-3M2e-DD i.n. One day later they were challenged with heterosubtypic X-31 virus. Animals which received PR8 immune serum followed by a homologous challenge with PR8 virus served as positive control group. Mice were observed daily for clinical symptoms using the score sheet described previously. We found that PR8 immune serum completely protected mice against PR8 virus infection. Serum from mice immunized i.n. with PR8 WIV without adjuvant did not provide protection against infection with heterosubtypic X-31 virus and the mice transfused with this serum exhibited high clinical scores and reduced survival (Fig. 3a, b). By contrast, serum from mice immunized with WIV plus CAF09 or CTA1-3M2e-DD protected partially and clinical scores were reduced by 50% compared to unimmunised control mice. Thus, non-neutralizing serum IgG WIV appeared to partially protect against heterosubtypic X-31 virus challenge. Next, we studied the role of CD4+ T cells in protection. Depletion of CD4 T cells was achieved through anti-CD4 Mab-treatment of mice and resulted in reduction of CD4 T cell numbers in peripheral blood by >95% (data not shown). We found that CD4 depletion did not affect survival (Fig. 4b-d) or clinical scores (Fig. 4e-h) upon X-31 virus infection in the well immunized animals. Yet, CD4 T cell depletion had a significant effect on lung virus titers in animals immunized with WIV and CTA1-3M2e-DD while all other immunization protocols showed comparable lung virus titers irrespective of CD4 depletion (Fig. 4i). Therefore, CD4 T cells appeared to play a role in protection against heterobsubtypic challenge only in the CTA1-3M2e-DD group. Finally, we addressed whether cross-reactive local IgA antibodies impacted on protection against infection in the mice immunized i.n. by repeating the immunization/ challenge experiment in IgA KO mice. In line with reports in literature, we found that mock-immunized IgA KO mice were more susceptible to influenza infection than mock- immunized wt Balb/c mice, demonstrated by higher clinical scores post challange.45 Wild-type Balb/c mice immunized with non-adjuvanted WIV demonstrated reduced clinical scores as compared to non-immunized Balb/c mice but this was not the case for IgA KO mice indicating a role for IgA in protection. (Fig. 5a, e) (Fig. 5b, f). When immunized with WIV and any of the mucosal adjuvants, wt and IgA KO mice developed protective immunity and survived the challenge infection (Fig.5c, d, g, h). 2 WIV and mucosal adjuvants as broadly protective flu vaccines43Clinical scores of IgA KO mice immunized with CAF09 adjuvanted vaccine were higher than those of wt mice (Fig. 5 g). Mice immunized with CTA1-3M2e-DD adjuvanted WIV developed the lowest clinical scores with little difference between wt and IgA KO mice (Fig. 5 h). These results suggest that local IgA antibodies exerted some protection from severe disease but were not critical for survival in this model. DISCUSSI on In this study, we compared liposome and protein adjuvants head-to-head to assess their relative efficacy in inducing cross-reactive immunity in mice, when combined with i.m. and i.n. administered WIV. In addition, we dissected which immune parameters contributed to protection and to what extent these would be vaccine-specific. The results indicate that i.n. administered WIV combined with a mucosal adjuvant provided enhanced cross-protection compared to WIV administered i.m. with or without adjuvant and non-adjuvanted i.n.. IgA and IFN-producing CD4 T significantly higher for mice immunized i.n. with WIV plus adjuvant than for the other, less well protected groups. While non-neutralizing serum IgG antibodies and CD4 T cells were contributing to protection, our experiments in IgA KO mice were less conclusive, but there was a trend towards a protective effect of local IgA on the clinical symptoms. Mucosal immunization has been shown to be superior to parenteral immunization for stimulating local immunity and resident memory T cells in the lung46-48 and to provide cross-protection against heterosubtypic virus challenge.14,49 In agreement with these studies, we found that i.n. immunization with adjuvanted WIV afforded stronger cross-protection than parenteral immunizations. This was the case even though serum anti-viral IgG levels appeared quite comparable for mice immunized i.m. or i.n. with adjuvanted vaccines. Upon heterologous infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, clinical symptoms and survival correlated poorly with virus replication in the lungs while for heterosubtypic infection with X-31 virus we observed a clear correlation between clinical scores and lung virus titers. There is evidence that the kinetics of virus replication differ for the two virus strains with H1N1pdm09 peaking on day 7 and X-31 virus peaking on day 3. We determined lung virus titers on day 3 post infection which might have been optimal for X-31 virus but too early for A(H1N1)pm09 virus.50,51 Adjuvanted WIV vaccines induced significantly higher systemic immune responses compared to non-adjuvanted WIV. Interestingly, the levels of serum IgG antibodies reacting with homologous, heterologous and heterosubtypic WIV in ELISA assays were similar, suggesting that most of the IgG antibodies induced by immunization with WIV were cross-reactive. This is in line with recent observations in humans that also 2 WIV and mucosal adjuvants as broadly protective flu vaccines43Clinical scores of IgA KO mice immunized with CAF09 adjuvanted vaccine were higher than those of wt mice (Fig. 5 g).

Interestingly, the levels of serum IgG antibodies reacting with homologous, heterologous and heterosubtypic WIV in ELISA assays were similar, suggesting that most of the IgG antibodies induced by immunization with WIV were cross-reactive. This is in line with recent observations in humans that also 2 Chapter 244indicate that many influenza-specific antibodies, whether measured before or after vaccination, are cross-reactive.52,53 Although serum antibodies induced by adjuvanted WIV were cross-reactive they could not neutralize heterologous and heterosubtypic virus in vitro , which was according to expectations.43,54 Nevertheless, when transferred to na\u00efve animals these antibodies provided partial protection against X-31 challenge. It has been shown that anti-influenza antibodies can mediate cross-protection via non- neutralizing mechanisms such as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis, or complement mediated cytotoxicity (CDC).55-58 Which of these mechanisms, if any, is involved in protection afforded by WIV adjuvanted with CAF09 or CTA1-3M2e-DD remains to be elucidated. Vaccination with WIV plus mucosal adjuvants also led to remarkably enhanced levels of cross-reactive local IgA in the lungs and nose of mice. IgA has been shown to be more cross-reactive than IgG.59,60 Moreover, Maurer et al have recently shown that IgA antibodies can also neutralize influenza virus in an antigen-aspecific manner by providing sialic acid in the glycosylated Fc part which serves as a decoy receptor not only for influenza virus but also for other viruses using sialic acid as a receptor.61 However, in our study adjuvanted WIV administered i.n. completely protected IgA KO mice from reaching the humane endpoint post heterosubtypic challenge, similar to wt Balb/c mice. Neverthelss, we cannot exclude that local IgA antibodies exerted some protective function, as reflected in the higher clinical scores in immunized and challenged IgA KO mice compared to the wt mice. Whether local IgA plays a role in cross-protection induced by adjuvanted WIV administered i.n. or not is controversial. For example, Zhang et al62 showed that i.n. immunization with a CTB/CT-adjuvanted subunit vaccine stimulated equally efficient control of virus growth in wt and IgA KO mice. Yet, using mice deficient in the poly Ig receptor and thus unable to transport IgA across the respiratory epithelium, Asahi et al demonstrated that mucosal IgA is critical, in particular for protection from heterologous virus challenge.63 IFN-producing cross-reactive CD4 positive T cells increased significantly upon mucosal vaccination, especially in mice immunized with WIV plus CTA1-3M2e-DD. This could be due to the fact that M2e contains an MHC class II restricted CD4 helper epitope.33 CD4 depletion shortly before and after challenge did not affect survival, but impaired the control of lung virus growth in animals vaccinated with WIV plus CTA1-3M2e-DD, indicating a role of CD4 T cells in controlling virus growth rather than controlling clinical symptoms and in turn survival. CAF09-adjuvanted WIV did not induce significant numbers of CD4 T cells and accordingly, depletion of CD4 T cells during infection did not affect clinical scores or lung virus titers. We did not observe IFN-producing CD8 T cells induced by vaccination. This was somewhat unexpected since at least CAF01, CAF09, and CTA1-DD are known to support induction of CD8 T cells.24,28,31,64 Failure to detect CD8 T cells in our experiments might be 2 Chapter 244indicate that many influenza-specific antibodies, whether measured before or after vaccination, are cross-reactive.52,53 Although serum antibodies induced by adjuvanted WIV were cross-reactive they could not neutralize heterologous and heterosubtypic virus in vitro , which was according to expectations.43,54 Nevertheless, when transferred to na\u00efve animals these antibodies provided partial protection against X-31 challenge.

We assessed CD8 T cell responses on day 25 after the last immunization, by which time the cells were already through the retraction phase and the numbers might therefore have been too low to detect. Furthermore, we used intracellular cytokine staining, a method which allows simultanous determination of multiple cell populations and cytokines but is not as sensitive as ELISPOT assay for the detection of CD8 T cells. Despite the fact that we did not find them, we cannot categorically rule out that CD8 T cells contributed to protection. It is known that lung tissue resident memory (TRM) CD8 T cells have an important role in protection from influenza infection.65,66 These cells might indeed have been induced in our experiments, but as parts of the lungs had to be used for other purposes and the remaining tissues were insufficient for isolating the required numbers of lymphocytes, we were unable to investigate them. Follow up studies will address this issue. Although WIV plus CAF01 induced the highest levels of cross-reactive antibodies, mice in the respective experimental group showed severe clinical symptoms and reduced survival post challenge. One thing which distinguished the CAF01 vaccinated mice group from the other groups was the induction of anti-NP antibodies. In a pre-clinical study in pigs by Ricklin et al, NP vaccination produced a strong immune response but induced lung inflammation and immunized pigs were not protected.67 In murine models the situation is not entirely clear. Although it has been shown that anti-NP antibodies can confer resistance to influenza virus infection68-70 (contrary to our results), a previous study from our group demonstrated that mice vaccinated with NP adjuvanted with MPLA (which developed NP-specific antibodies) showed more rapid weight loss in the initial phase of infection than mock vaccinated mice.71 Furthermore, animals receiving a virosomal vaccine without NP showed fewer signs of illness compared to mice receiving a virosomal vaccine with NP . The results of our head-to-head comparison of different vaccines underline that mucosal immunization with adjuvanted WIV is indeed a promising approach for developing a broadly protective influenza vaccine. Several immune mechanisms appear to contribute to cross-protection induced upon mucosal vaccination with adjuvanted WIV and optimal protection seems to require a combination of different mechanisms.

Here we investigated whether sequential immunization with antigenically distinct influenza vaccines can also provide cross-protection. To this end, we compared immune responses and protective potential against challenge with A(H1N1)pdm09 in mice infected sequentially with seasonal A(H1N1) virus followed by A(H3N2) virus or immunized sequentially with whole inactivated virus (WIV) or subunit (SU) vaccine derived from these viruses. Sequential infection provided solid cross-protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 infection while sequential vaccination with WIV, though not capable of preventing weight loss upon infection completely, protected the mice from reaching the humane endpoint. In contrast, sequential SU vaccination did not prevent rapid and extensive weight loss. Protection correlated with levels of cross-reactive but non-neutralizing antibodies of the IgG2a subclass, general increase of memory T cells and induction of influenza-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Adoptive serum transfer experiments revealed that despite lacking neutralizing activity, serum antibodies induced by sequential infection protected mice from weight loss and vigorous virus growth in the lungs upon A(H1N1)pdm09 virus challenge. Antibodies induced by WIV vaccination alleviated symptoms but could not control virus growth in the lung. Depletion of T cells prior to challenge revealed that CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ T cells, contributed to cross-protection. These results imply that sequential immunization with WIV but not SU derived from antigenically distinct viruses could alleviate the severity of infection caused by a pandemic and may improve protection to unpredictable seasonal infection.

Influenza vaccination is the most reliable strategy to control annual epidemics and irregular pandemics 1. Current inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) primarily induce strain- specific antibodies against the two major virus surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). However, these strain-specific antibodies cannot provide protection against antigenically drifted and antigenically shifted strains. When a pandemic strain emerges, it takes around six months to develop and distribute a new vaccine2, which is too late for a vaccine to provide effective protection during the first pandemic wave. Thus, a cross-protective vaccine that could provide immediate protection against unpredicted influenza virus strains is urgently needed. Live virus infection has been shown to provide some degree of cross-protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in animal models3-8 and in humans9,10. However, the exact mechanisms involved in cross-protection remain elusive. Cross-reactive antibodies against conserved regions of viral proteins, such as the HA stalk, the M2 ectodomain (M2e) and NP , induced by live virus infection, correlate with cross-protection3,11-13. Some anti-HA stalk antibodies can directly neutralize influenza virus particles in vitro14. However, most of these antibodies target antigens that are expressed on the surface of infected cells and then provide cross-protection via a Fc receptor dependent mechanism14-16. Besides antibody responses, cross-reactive T cells induced by live virus infection have also been demonstrated to correlate with cross-protection5,6,17. Cytotoxic CD8 T cells can recognize internal, conserved epitopes across different virus strains. In animal models, CD8 T cells induced by live virus infection have been shown to prevent A(H5N1) or A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection18. On the other hand, CD4 T cells specific for conserved epitopes have also been shown to provide protection against A(H1N1) pdm09 in mice19,20. These CD4 T cells could provide cross-protection through different mechanisms, including help for B cells, help for CD8 T cells and direct cytotoxic activity (reviewed in 21). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated in humans that the presence of memory cross-reactive CD4 or CD8 T cells is correlated with or virus infection9,22,23. Vaccination with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) did not provide protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection and was even found to be associated with enhanced disease in observational studies from Canada in humans24-28. In animal models, published studies indicate that vaccination with IIV could induce detectable levels of cross-reactive antibody against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, yet, no cross-protection was observed29-31.

If a broader immune response could be induced by the currently available influenza vaccines, it would benefit humans against novel virus infection. Compared with a single virus infection, sequential infection with antigenically distinct live viruses was found to provide broader cross-protection7, 8,11. This is because the second infection can cause a quick recall immune response to epitopes shared between the two viruses. It has been shown that sequential influenza virus infection can boost antibody responses to the shared HA stalk region11, 33. Sequential immunization with antigenically distinct vaccines has also been used as a strategy to induce a broader immune response against influenza virus in animal models34. However, most of these studies were focused on the cross-protective immune response induced by genetically modified vaccines35-38. Little is known about the protective potential of sequential immunization with conventional inactivated vaccines derived from different seasonal influenza virus strains. In case of a pandemic, such a vaccination strategy could be a first means of intervention until a pandemic vaccine becomes available. In this study, we assessed the cross-protective immune responses induced by sequential infection with A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) virus, or sequential immunization with whole inactivated virus (WIV) or subunit (SU) vaccine derived from these viruses in a mouse model. Sequential infection provided robust cross-protection which was mediated by non-neutralizing, cross-reactive antibody and CD8 effector memory T cells (TEM). Partial cross-protection was provided by sequential vaccination with WIV and was associated with CD8 central memory T cells (TCM), and to a minor extent, with cross-reactive antibodies. In contrast, sequential vaccination with SU vaccine induced low levels of cross-reactive serum antibodies and no T cell immunity against A(H1N1) pdm09, and did not provide cross-protection. These results imply that in case of a new pandemic, sequential immunization with WIV but not subunit vaccines derived from different seasonal virus strains could mitigate disease severity until a pandemic vaccine becomes available.

For NA-specific ELISA, recombinant NA protein of A(H1N1)pdm09 was expressed and purified as described previously41. ELISA plates were coated with 0.1 \u00b5g/well of NA overnight at 4 oC and assays were performed as described39. Pseudotype HA viruses (PV) bearing luciferase reporter were transfected alongside the relevant HA glycoprotein genes in the plasmid pI.18 42. Parental PV were produced bearing the HA of A/California/7/09 (H1), or A/duck/Memphis/546/1974 (H11). A chimeric HA (cHA) consisting stalk from A/California/7/09 (H1) and head based microneutralisation assays (pMN) were performed as described previously 42. Briefly, serial dilutions of serum were incubated with 1x106 relative luminescence units (RLU) of HA bearing PV per well on a 96-well white plate for 1h 37\u00b0C 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. 1.5x104 HEK293T/17 cells were then added per well and plates incubated at 37\u00b0C 5% CO2 for 48h reagent (Promega) and measurement of luciferase activity. Analysis was performed using Graph-Pad Prism. Stalk-directed antibody presence was measured via antibody titers recorded against the cHA and both of its parental strains (H11 and H1 PV). No (or negligible) antibodies should be present against the exotic H11 HA, restricting neutralisation of the cHA PV to antibodies directed against the conserved H1 stalk of the cHA. Control antibodies used included mAb CR6261 (Crucell, Johnson and from lung or spleen in complete IMDM medium were stimulated with CD28 (1 \u00b5g/ml, eBioscience), with or without X-181 overnight 37oC in a 5% CO2 incubator. Protein transport inhibitor cocktail (eBioscience) was added for the last 4 hours of stimulation. Stimulated cells were stained with fluorochrome conjugated antibodies, staining, cells were stained with Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 780 (eBioscience) to identify dead cells.

Briefly, splenocytes (2.5 x 105/well) collected on day 0 post-infection were incubated with or without 5 \u00b5g/ml NP366-374 plate. cells were detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IFN antibody. Spots were developed with BCIP/NBT substrate and counted with an AID Elispot reader (Autoimmune Diagnostika GmbH, Strassberg, Germany). The number of antigen- specific IFN-producing cells was calculated by subtracting the number of spots detected in the unstimulated samples from the number in stimulated samples. Tetramer staining for lung samples was performed as follows: isolated lung lymphocytes were incubated with A(H1N1)pdm09 NP366-374-tetramer-PE (containing the A(H1N1)pdm09 epitope ASNENMETM) for 40 min and then stained with mouse anti- CD8-PerCP-cy5.5 antibody for 40 min. Samples were acquired on a FACS CaliburTM BD II flow cytometer. Data were analyzed by Kaluza\u00ae Flow Cytometry Analysis Software. Serum adoptive transfer Mice were sequentially infected or sequentially immunized with WIV as described above and serum was collected on day 28 post second infection or immunization. Serum collected from mice that were immunized twice i.m. with A(H1N1)pdm09 WIV served as positive control. Pooled serum was tested by ELISA for presence of anti- A(H1N1)pdm09 antibodies. Naive mice (n = 5/group) received 200 \u00b5l of pooled serum by intraperitoneal injection one day before challenge with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. On day 6 post challenge, lungs were collected for virus titration. CD4 and CD8 T cell depletion in vivo For the T cell depletion study, mice were infected or vaccinated as described above and rested for 28 days. Groups of mice (n = 6/group) were injected with anti-CD4 T cell depletion antibody (200 \u00b5g/injection, GK1.5) or anti-CD8 T cell (200 \u00b5g/injection, YTS169). These antibodies were given i.p on day -1, 1 and 3 of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (104.4 TCID50) challenge. On day 6 post challenge, lungs were collected for virus titration. Spleens were collected to confirm the depletion of T cells. 3 Chapter 368(clone XMG1.2) (all monoclonal antibodies from eBioscience).

Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 6.01 for Windows. GraphPad Sofware, La Jolla, California, USA www.graphpad.com . P < 0.05, 0.01, 0.001 were considered as significantly different and were denoted by *, **, ***, individually. ReSUlTS Sequential infection, WIV and SU vaccination show different levels of cross-protective capacity against H1 n1pdm09 influenza virus infection To investigate the cross-protective immune response induced by sequential infection or vaccination with antigens from different influenza virus strains, we sequentially infected mice with PR8 and X-31 influenza virus or sequentially vaccinated mice with WIV or SU vaccines derived from these viruses. These viral strains were selected to reflect a heterosubtypic exposure history in humans. The cross-protective capacity of sequential infection or sequential immunization was determined by challenging the mice with virus A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09. After A(H1N1)pdm09 virus challenge, mice in the sequential SU vaccination group showed similar weight loss as mice in the PBS control group and developed severe symptoms, necessitating euthanasia on day 6 or 7 post challenge (Fig. 1 A, B). Mice that were sequentially vaccinated with WIV showed a similar trend of weight loss as mice in the PBS control group until day 6 post infection. Yet, from day 7 post infection onwards, WIV immunized mice recovered and none of the mice reached the humane endpoint. In the sequential infection group, mice showed no or only minor weight loss after challenge and none of them needed to be sacrificed. On day 3 post-challenge, lung virus titers in the sequential SU vaccination group did not differ significantly from those in the PBS control group (Fig. 1C). In the sequential WIV vaccination group, lung virus titers were decreased by 0.9 log10 as compared to the PBS group (p = 0.03). Sequential infection resulted in a significant decrease of the lung virus titer by 2 log10 relative to the control group (p = 0.015). These data demonstrate that sequential immunization with WIV, although being less effective than sequential infection with live virus, provided a certain level of cross-protection against heterologous infection. In contrast, sequential SU vaccination did not provide cross-protection. 3 Cross-protective immunity through sequential flu vaccination69Statistics Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine the differences between read-outs of two different groups.

In contrast, sequential SU vaccination did not provide cross-protection. 3 Chapter 370Sequential infection, WIV and SU vaccination induce distinct cross- reactive antibody immune responses To explore the immune mechanisms involved in protection from weight loss and lung virus growth upon challenge, antibody responses induced by sequential infection with PR8 and X-31 or immunization with PR8 and X-31 derived vaccines were determined. A single infection with PR8 or immunization with PR8-derived vaccines raised antibodies recognizing PR8 surface proteins in all animals. Although the dose of WIV and SU vaccines was chosen such that both contained the same amount of surface antigens, a single immunization with WIV induced around 30 times more PR8 HA/NA specific IgG than a single immunization with SU (p<0.0001) (Fig. 2A). Antibody titers raised by a sublethal infection were significantly higher than those raised by WIV (p< 0.01) but the difference was only 1.7-fold. Upon subsequent immunization/infection with X-31, on day 56, antibody titers to X-31 HA/NA in WIV-immunized mice were approximately 10-fold higher than in SU-immunized mice and around 3-fold higher than in sequentially infected mice (p<0.0001) (Fig. 2B). On day 56, after sequential exposure to PR8 and X-31, we also determined antibody titers against heterologous A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Sequential infection induced around 20 times more cross-reactive IgG antibody than sequential WIV vaccination and approximately 75 times more than sequential SU vaccination (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2C). With respect to the subtype profile of the IgG antibodies, sequential infection and WIV vaccination induced a Th1-type antibody response. The average ratio of serum IgG2a to IgG1 concentration was 3 for mice sequentially infected by live virus, compared with 1.5 induced by sequential WIV vaccination. In contrast, sequential SU vaccination induced a similar amount of IgG1 antibody as induced by sequential WIV vaccination but no IgG2a (Fig. 2D). However, cross-reactive antibodies, irrespective of whether induced by sequential infection or immunization, did not neutralize A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (Fig. 2E). With respect to mucosal antibodies, only sequential infection was found to induce cross-reactive IgA antibody against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in the nose (Fig. 2F). In order to reveal the target protein(s) of the observed cross-reactive antibodies we first performed a pseudovirus-based assay to detect antibodies to the HA stalk domain. This assay uses a chimeric HA as antigen, with an H11 globular head, and an H1 stalk. The chimeric particles were effectively neutralized by the CR6261 mAb control which binds to the H1 stalk. However, no or very low amounts of antibodies reacting with the H1 stalk were observed in any of the experimental groups (Fig. S1A). Next, we examined anti-NA antibodies against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. The mice from the sequential infection group and 4 out of 5 mice from the WIV vaccination group developed anti-NA antibodies, while only 2 out of 5 mice from the sequential SU vaccination group did so and levels of anti-NA antibody were low (Fig. S1B). Next, 3 Chapter 370Sequential infection, WIV and SU vaccination induce distinct cross- reactive antibody immune responses To explore the immune mechanisms involved in protection from weight loss and lung virus growth upon challenge, antibody responses induced by sequential infection with PR8 and X-31 or immunization with PR8 and X-31 derived vaccines were determined.

Antibody titers raised by a sublethal infection were significantly higher than those raised by WIV (p< 0.01) but the difference was only 1.7-fold. Upon subsequent immunization/infection with X-31, on day 56, antibody titers to X-31 HA/NA in WIV-immunized mice were approximately 10-fold higher than in SU-immunized mice and around 3-fold higher than in sequentially infected mice (p<0.0001) (Fig. 2B). On day 56, after sequential exposure to PR8 and X-31, we also determined antibody titers against heterologous A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Sequential infection induced around 20 times more cross-reactive IgG antibody than sequential WIV vaccination and approximately 75 times more than sequential SU vaccination (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2C). With respect to the subtype profile of the IgG antibodies, sequential infection and WIV vaccination induced a Th1-type antibody response. The average ratio of serum IgG2a to IgG1 concentration was 3 for mice sequentially infected by live virus, compared with 1.5 induced by sequential WIV vaccination. In contrast, sequential SU vaccination induced a similar amount of IgG1 antibody as induced by sequential WIV vaccination but no IgG2a (Fig. 2D). However, cross-reactive antibodies, irrespective of whether induced by sequential infection or immunization, did not neutralize A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (Fig. 2E). With respect to mucosal antibodies, only sequential infection was found to induce cross-reactive IgA antibody against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in the nose (Fig. 2F).

However, no or very low amounts of antibodies reacting with the H1 stalk were observed in any of the experimental groups (Fig. S1A). Next, we examined anti-NA antibodies against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. The mice from the sequential infection group and 4 out of 5 mice from the WIV vaccination group developed anti-NA antibodies, while only 2 out of 5 mice from the sequential SU vaccination group did so and levels of anti-NA antibody were low (Fig. S1B). Next, 3 Cross-protective immunity through sequential flu vaccination71anti-M2e antibody were determined coating conserved M2e peptide onto 96-well ELISA plate. Anti-M2e antibodies were only found in the sequential infection group (Fig. S1C). We also analyzed the presence of cross-reactive antibodies against conserved internal proteins in serum using recombinant NP from HK68 (H3N2), which shows 90% of sequence homology with NP from A(H1N1)pdm09. Sequential infection and WIV vaccination induced similar though somewhat variable amounts of anti-NP antibodies (Fig. S1D). As expected, no anti-NP antibody was found in the sequential SU vaccination group. These data indicate that sequential infection induced broader and higher amounts of cross-reactive non-neutralizing antibodies than sequential WIV vaccination, while SU vaccination induced only antibodies against hemagglutinin and to a limited extent against neuraminidase. Moreover, responses to live virus and WIV were dominated by IgG2a while responses to SU consisted exclusively of IgG1 antibodies. Sequential infection, WIV and SU vaccination induce different memory T cell immune response Apart from cross-reactive antibody response, cellular immune responses also play an important role in cross-protection. We first evaluated the overall memory T cell responses in spleen and lungs from mice after sequential infections or vaccinations. None of these immunization strategies could significantly enhance the number of memory CD4+CD44+ T cells (p = 0.28) (Fig. 3A). In contrast, numbers of memory CD8+CD44+ T cells were significantly enhanced in spleen (p = 0.028) and lung (p = 0.015) of sequentially infected mice compared with mice of the unvaccinated group (Fig. 3B). Also, sequential WIV vaccination enhanced memory CD8+CD44+ T cell numbers, however, only in spleen was significance reached (p = 0.02) (Fig. 3B). No increase in the number of memory CD8 T cells was found in the sequential SU vaccination group. Interestingly, while the CD8 memory T cell population in sequentially infected mice consisted of CD62L negative TEM as well as CD62L positive TCM, the majority of memory CD8 T cells from the sequential WIV vaccination group consisted of TCM (Fig. 3C, Fig. S2A). These data indicate that sequential infection and sequential immunization with WIV are capable of stimulating CD8 memory responses while immunization with SU is not. For detection of influenza specific T cells, splenocytes from sequentially infected or sequentially immunized mice were stimulated overnight with WIV, and IFN production was assessed by intracellular cytokine staining. In live virus infected mice, percentages of IFN-producing CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells in spleen and lung were significantly higher than in mock immunized mice (Fig. 4A, Fig. S2B, p < 0.05). Moreover, around 90% of the IFN-producing CD8 T cells were effector memory cells (data not shown). Also in 3 Cross-protective immunity through sequential flu vaccination71anti-M2e antibody titers were determined coating conserved M2e peptide onto 96-well ELISA plate. Anti-M2e antibodies were only found in the sequential infection group (Fig. S1C). We also analyzed the presence of cross-reactive antibodies against conserved internal proteins in serum using recombinant NP from HK68 (H3N2), which shows 90% of sequence homology with NP from A(H1N1)pdm09.

Also, sequential WIV vaccination enhanced memory CD8+CD44+ T cell numbers, however, only in spleen was significance reached (p = 0.02) (Fig. 3B). No increase in the number of memory CD8 T cells was found in the sequential SU vaccination group. Interestingly, while the CD8 memory T cell population in sequentially infected mice consisted of CD62L negative TEM as well as CD62L positive TCM, the majority of memory CD8 T cells from the sequential WIV vaccination group consisted of TCM (Fig. 3C, Fig. S2A). These data indicate that sequential infection and sequential immunization with WIV are capable of stimulating CD8 memory responses while immunization with SU is not. For detection of influenza specific T cells, splenocytes from sequentially infected or sequentially immunized mice were stimulated overnight with WIV, and IFN production was assessed by intracellular cytokine staining. In live virus infected mice, percentages of IFN-producing CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells in spleen and lung were significantly higher than in mock immunized mice (Fig. 4A, Fig. S2B, p < 0.05). Moreover, around 90% of the IFN-producing CD8 T cells were effector memory cells (data not shown). Also in 3 Chapter 372WIV immunized mice, enhanced percentages of IFN positive CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells were found, yet lower than in the LV group. Significance as compared to PBS control animals was reached only for CD4+ T cells in spleen. The influenza-specific CD8 T cells induced by infection or immunization were also enumerated by ELISPOT after stimulation of splenocytes with NP366-374 from PR8 virus (the as well as X-31 virus). NP- specific CD8 T cells were detected in the WIV and the sequential infection group, but numbers were around 12 times higher in the latter (Fig. 4B, p = 0.008). Next, we assessed the cross-reactivity of these NP-specific CD8 T cells to A(H1N1)pdm09 NP staining with containing the ASENENMETM epitope (from A(H1N1)pdm09 virus). No tetramer positive CD8 T cells were observed in these groups of mice (Fig. 4C) while tetramer positive cells were readily detected in blood of mice infected with A(H1N1) pdm09 virus. Serum antibodies induced by sequential infection are sufficient to provide cross-protection but antibodies induced by WIV vaccination are not Our data show that sequential infection and sequential immunization with WIV could provide protection against severe symptoms upon infection with an A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. To determine the contribution of cross-reactive antibodies against A(H1N1) pdm09 virus challenge, serum from sequentially virus infected, WIV vaccinated or PBS control mice was passively transferred to naive mice one day before A(H1N1)pdm09 virus challenge. Serum from mice vaccinated with WIV derived from A(H1N1)pdm09 virus served as positive control. Mice receiving serum from mice immunized with A(H1N1)pdm09 WIV (positive control, neutralizing titer 330) via adoptive transfer did not show weight loss upon A(H1N1)pdm09 virus challenge (Fig. 5A) and lung virus titers in these animals were decreased by more than 2 logs compared to the titers in the PBS control group (Fig. 5B, p < 0.01). Similarly, mice receiving serum from the sequential infection group showed no or only mild weight loss. Interestingly, despite the fact that the transferred serum did not contain any neutralizing antibodies, lung virus titers in this group were decreased to the same low level as in mice which had received serum from A(H1N1)pdm09- immunized mice containing neutralizing antibodies. Also serum from the sequential WIV vaccination group provided partial protection; 4 out of 5 mice receiving this serum showed no or mild weight loss, while one mouse went down quickly. Yet, lung virus titers in the WIV vaccination group, though slightly lower, did not differ significantly from those in PBS-treated controls (p = 0.22) (Fig. 5B). 3 Chapter 372WIV immunized mice, enhanced percentages of IFN positive CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells were found, yet lower than in the LV group. Significance as compared to PBS control animals was reached only for CD4+ T cells in spleen. The influenza-specific CD8 T cells induced by infection or immunization were also enumerated by ELISPOT after stimulation of splenocytes with NP366-374 from PR8 virus (the as well as X-31 virus).

No tetramer positive CD8 T cells were observed in these groups of mice (Fig. 4C) while tetramer positive cells were readily detected in blood of mice infected with A(H1N1) pdm09 virus.

Yet, lung virus titers in the WIV vaccination group, though slightly lower, did not differ significantly from those in PBS-treated controls (p = 0.22) (Fig. 5B). 3 Cross-protective immunity through sequential flu vaccination73These data indicate that non-neutralizing antibodies induced by sequential infection were as effective as neutralizing antibodies induced by A(H1N1)pdm09 WIV vaccination in providing protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus challenge. However, non-neutralizing antibody induced by sequential WIV vaccination were not sufficient to provide full cross-protection. Memory T cells induced by sequential live virus infection or WIV vaccination are involved in cross-protection against A(H1 n1)pdm09 virus challenge To determine the contribution of T cell immune responses to cross-protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection, we used CD4 or CD8 specific antibodies to deplete T cells before and during A(H1N1)pdm09 challenge. On day 6 post-challenge, we confirmed that 95% of CD8 T cells or 96% of CD4 T cells in mice spleen were depleted by this treatment (data not shown). Mice in the PBS mock vaccination group, no matter whether treated with PBS, CD4 depletion antibody or CD8 depletion antibody, showed continuous weight loss after A(H1N1)pdm09 challenge (Fig.6A, PBS) and displayed the same virus titers in lung tissue on day 6 post-infection (Fig. 6B, PBS). In contrast, mice in the sequential infection group were protected from weight loss and showed low or undetectable lung virus titers (Fig. 6A, LV). Depletion of CD4 T cells in these mice had no effect on protection. Depletion of CD8 T cells in the sequential infection group had some effect on protection from weight loss; on day 6 post A(H1N1)pdm09 virus challenge 3 out of 6 mice had lost > 6.5 % weight while in non-depleted mice the most severe weight loss was 2.1% and was observed in a single mouse only (Fig. 6A, LV). In addition, lung virus titers were about 1.5 log10 higher in the CD8-depleted mice than in non-depleted control mice of the sequential infection group; yet, virus titers were still significantly lower than in non- immunized mice. In the WIV vaccination group, depletion of CD4 or CD8 T cell did not significantly alter the weight loss compared with mock depletion but a strong trend towards less weight loss was observed in mice depleted for CD4 T cells as compared to non-depleted mice of this group (P = 0.054, Fig. 6a, WIV). Depletion of CD4 T cells decreased and depletion of CD8 T cells increased lung virus titers by about 1 log as compared to non-depleted animals on day 6 post challenge but these trends did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 6B, WIV). Moreover, virus titers in WIV-immunized CD8 T cell-depleted mice were of the same magnitude as those in the PBS mock vaccination group. These data above suggests that CD4 memory T cells were most likely not involved in cross-protection while CD8 memory T cells induced by sequential infection or WIV immunization contributed decisively to cross-protection. 3 Cross-protective immunity through sequential flu vaccination73These data indicate that non-neutralizing antibodies induced by sequential infection were as effective as neutralizing antibodies induced by A(H1N1)pdm09 WIV vaccination in providing protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus challenge. However, non-neutralizing antibody induced by sequential WIV vaccination were not sufficient to provide full cross-protection. Memory T cells induced by sequential live virus infection or WIV vaccination are involved in cross-protection against A(H1 n1)pdm09 virus challenge To determine the contribution of T cell immune responses to cross-protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection, we used CD4 or CD8 specific antibodies to deplete T cells before and during A(H1N1)pdm09 challenge. On day 6 post-challenge, we confirmed that 95% of CD8 T cells or 96% of CD4 T cells in mice spleen were depleted by this treatment (data not shown). Mice in the PBS mock vaccination group, no matter whether treated with PBS, CD4 depletion antibody or CD8 depletion antibody, showed continuous weight loss after A(H1N1)pdm09 challenge (Fig.6A, PBS) and displayed the same virus titers in lung tissue on day 6 post-infection (Fig. 6B, PBS). In contrast, mice in the sequential infection group were protected from weight loss and showed low or undetectable lung virus titers (Fig. 6A, LV). Depletion of CD4 T cells in these mice had no effect on protection. Depletion of CD8 T cells in the sequential infection group had some effect on protection from weight loss; on day 6 post A(H1N1)pdm09 virus challenge 3 out of 6 mice had lost > 6.5 % weight while in non-depleted mice the most severe weight loss was 2.1% and was observed in a single mouse only (Fig. 6A, LV). In addition, lung virus titers were about 1.5 log10 higher in the CD8-depleted mice than in non-depleted control mice of the sequential infection group; yet, virus titers were still significantly lower than in non- immunized mice. In the WIV vaccination group, depletion of CD4 or CD8 T cell did not significantly alter the weight loss compared with mock depletion but a strong trend towards less weight loss was observed in mice depleted for CD4 T cells as compared to non-depleted mice of this group (P = 0.054, Fig. 6a, WIV). Depletion of CD4 T cells decreased and depletion of CD8 T cells increased lung virus titers by about 1 log as compared to non-depleted animals on day 6 post challenge but these trends did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 6B, WIV). Moreover, virus titers in WIV-immunized CD8 T cell-depleted mice were of the same magnitude as those in the PBS mock vaccination group. These data above suggests that CD4 memory T cells were most likely not involved in cross-protection while CD8 memory T cells induced by sequential infection or WIV immunization contributed decisively to cross-protection. 3 Chapter 374DISCUSSI on To determine whether sequential immunization with antigenically distinct traditional vaccines could provide cross-protection, mice were sequentially immunized with WIV or SU vaccines derived from PR8 and X-31 viruses and then challenged with an A(H1N1) pdm09 virus. Another group of mice was sequentially infected with sublethal doses of PR8 followed by X-31 prior to A(H1N1)pdm09 virus challenge. We demonstrate that sequential infection provided solid cross-protection which was correlated with cross- protective antibodies and CD8 TEM cells. Sequential vaccination with WIV provided partial cross-protection which also correlated with induction of cross-reactive antibodies and CD8 T cells. Yet, sequential SU vaccination did not provide cross-protection. Neither sequential infection nor sequential immunization resulted in induction of antibodies capable of neutralizing A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Yet, substantial amounts of cross-reactive non-neutralizing antibodies were induced. Previous publications have shown that non-neutralizing antibodies, for example anti-HA stem antibodies, can be induced by sequential infection with antigenically distinct viruses and may provide cross-protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus infection11,12. In contrast to these findings, no anti-HA stem antibodies were found in this study. This may be due to the fact that the two virus strains (PR8 and X-31) used for infection/immunization belong to two different phylogenetic groups. The HA-stem regions from PR8 and X-31 virus show low similarity, which might have impaired boosting of HA-stem reactive B cells induced by PR8 through exposure to X-31. Nevertheless, we found cross-reactive antibodies against other conserved proteins in this study. Anti-M2e, anti-NP and anti- NA antibodies were induced by sequential infection and, although to a lesser extent, by sequential WIV immunization. In contrast, sequential SU immunization induced only very moderate amounts of anti-NA antibodies cross-reactive with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Since no neutralizing antibodies were found, the cross-reactive but non-neutralizing antibodies likely are the reason for the cross-protection observed in the serum adoptive transfer experiment. Non-neutralizing antibodies can provide cross-protection via Fc receptor dependent mechanisms (reviewed in 44). Interestingly, control of lung virus growth by non-neutralizing antibodies evoked by sequential infection with PR8 and X-31 was as effective as by neutralizing antibodies evoked by A(H1N1)pdm09 WIV. Even in absence of antigen-specific T cells, neutralizing antibodies are thus not crucial for protection, suggesting that non-neutralizing antibodies maybe more important for cross-protection than generally thought. Recent studies revealed that in humans antibodies cross-reacting with different influenza virus strains are common and are effectively enhanced by vaccination with seasonal influenza vaccines45,46. These antibodies might play a role in disease mitigation. 3 Chapter 374DISCUSSI on To determine whether sequential immunization with antigenically distinct traditional vaccines could provide cross-protection, mice were sequentially immunized with WIV or SU vaccines derived from PR8 and X-31 viruses and then challenged with an A(H1N1) pdm09 virus.

These antibodies might play a role in disease mitigation. 3 Cross-protective immunity through sequential flu vaccination75Hillaire et al and Guo et al have shown that one dose of serum from virus-infected animals could not provide cross-protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection in mice5,6, while Fang et al have shown that four doses of serum could provide cross- protection3. These studies imply that the amount of non-neutralizing cross-reactive antibodies may also play an important role in cross-protection. In the present study, cross-reactive antibody titers evoked by sequential WIV immunization were 20-fold lower than those evoked by sequential infection. We thus speculate that antibodies induced by WIV immunization, though in principle cross-protective as indicated by our data, were not present in sufficient amounts to confer complete protection. Although sequential infection and sequential WIV immunization induced virus- specific IFN-producing CD4 T cells, depletion of CD4 T cells in this study did not influence the cross-protection, neither in the sequential infection group nor in the sequential WIV vaccination group. These results contrast with previous findings which indicate that CD4 T cells might play a role in cross-protection5,6,21. Hillaire et al reported that na\u00efve mice that received T cells (a mixture of CD4 and CD8 T cells) induced by a single A(H3N2) (HK68) virus infection acquired better cross-protection against A(H1N1) pdm09 virus infection than na\u00efve mice that received purified CD8 T cells only6. Another study by Guo et al reported that depletion of CD4 T cells induced by a single X-31 virus infection impaired the cross-protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection in mice5. In this study, not only CD4 T cells, but also robust cross-reactive antibodies and CD8 T cell immune responses were induced by sequential infection. These antibodies or CD8 T cells alone could significantly reduce the virus titer in mice lung in the absence of CD4 T cells. We conclude that CD4 T cell are not essential for cross-protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 during infection in this mouse model. CD8 T cells play an important role in cross-protection. In the present study, depletion of CD8 T cells induced by sequential WIV immunization resulted in lung virus titers similar to those in PBS mock vaccinated mice, implying that CD8 T cells are important for cross-protection induced by sequential WIV immunization. These results agree with those reported by Furuya et al who showed that WIV (prepared by -irradiation) did not provide cross-protection against heterologous virus infection in mice defective in CD8 T cells 47. Another study by Budimir et al also has shown that depletion of CD8 T cells induced by 2 doses of WIV abolished the cross-protection against heterologous virus challenge48. Depletion of CD8 T cells in the sequential infection group prior to A(H1N1) pdm09 challenge had a significant though moderate effect on lung virus titers. This result implies that in the sequential infection group CD8 T cells do play a role in cross- protection, but team up with other mechanisms, eg antibodies (Fig. 5), to provide full protection. Our findings are also in line with previous publications which demonstrate 3 Cross-protective immunity through sequential flu vaccination75Hillaire et al and Guo et al have shown that one dose of serum from virus-infected animals could not provide cross-protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection in mice5,6, while Fang et al have shown that four doses of serum could provide cross- protection3.

This result implies that in the sequential infection group CD8 T cells do play a role in cross- protection, but team up with other mechanisms, eg antibodies (Fig. 5), to provide full protection. Our findings are also in line with previous publications which demonstrate 3 Chapter 376that CD4 T cells or antibody immune responses are required to cooperate with CD8 T cells for providing optimal cross-protection in live virus infected mice5,17,49. that PR8 NP366-374 epitope -specific T cells elicited by PR8 and boosted by X-31 virus or WIV could not recognize the corresponding A(H1N1)pdm09 NP366-374 epitope. This result is in line with previous findings demonstrating that X-31 NP366-374 epitope cannot be recognized by A(H1N1) pdm09 NP-specific CD8 T cells50. However, Guo et al have reported that influenza NP and PA proteins from PR8 and A(H1N1)pdm09 virus share many conserved epitopes50. It is possible that influenza-specific CD8 T cells against these shared conserved epitopes induced by sequential infection or WIV immunization provided cross-protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus infection. Different phenotypes of memory CD8 T cells show different capacities in cross- protection, for example Wu et al have shown that CD8 TCM induced by influenza virus infection are not required for cross-protection17. In the present study, we found that sequential infection mainly induced CD8 TEM. This result is in line with previous findings in mice and humans reporting that a single influenza infection predominantly induces influenza-specific CD8 TEM cells51,52. CD8 TEM have been shown to be associated with a fast recall immune response to the infection site, thus providing immediate cross- protection51. Interestingly, we found that sequential WIV immunization was more likely to induce CD8 TCM. These cells have shown high proliferation ability in secondary lymphoid organs but to provide delayed cross-protection53. Thus, we propose that CD8 TEM in lung and spleen induced by sequential infection provided immediate local antiviral effects, resulting in solid cross-protection. In contrast, CD8 TCM in spleen induced by sequential WIV immunization provided delayed antiviral effects in the lung, resulting in partial cross-protection. A limitation of our study is the fact that we did not investigate whether sequential infection/immunization with the same virus could also provide protection from infection by a heterologous virus subtype. We therefore cannot formally conclude that antigenically distinct viruses are required to induce cross-protection. However, it has been well established that vaccination with distinct vaccines focuses the immune response on conserved antigens which would be a clear benefit when attempting to raise cross-protection. In summary, sequential infection with antigenically distinct viruses provided solid cross-protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection. Yet, sequential immunization with antigenically distinct SU failed to provide cross-protection. Intriguingly, sequential immunization with antigenically distinct WIV provided partial cross-protection by a mechanism involving cross-reactive but non-neutralizing antibodies as well as CD8+ T cells.

However, influenza NP protein alone cannot induce CTL immunity due to its low capacity to activate antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and get access to the MHC class I antigen processing pathway. To facilitate the generation of NP-specific CTL immunity we developed a novel influenza vaccine consisting of virosomes with the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligand (MPLA) and the metal- ion-chelating DOGS-NTA-Ni incorporated in the membrane. In vitro , virosomes with incorporated MPLA induced stronger activation of APCs unadjuvanted virosomes. Virosomes modified with DOGS-NTA-Ni showed high conjugation efficacy for his-tagged proteins and facilitated efficient uptake of conjugated proteins by APCs. Immunization of mice with MPLA-adjuvanted virosomes with attached NP resulted in priming of NP-specific CTLs while MPLA-adjuvanted virosomes with admixed NP were inefficient in priming CTLs. Both vaccines induced equally high titers of NP-specific antibodies. When challenged with heterosubtypic influenza virus, mice immunized with virosomes with attached or admixed NP were protected from severe weight loss. Yet, unexpectedly, they showed more weight loss and more severe disease symptoms than mice immunized with MPLA-virosomes without NP . Taken together, these results indicate that virosomes with conjugated antigen and adjuvant incorporated in the membrane are effective in priming of CTLs and eliciting antigen-specific antibody responses in vivo . However, for protection from influenza infection NP-specific immunity appeared not to be advantageous.

Keywords: MPLA-ajuvanted virosomes as cross-protective flu vaccine93InTRoDUCTI on Influenza A virus infections cause considerable mortality and morbidity to the human population during seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics. Depending on the sequence of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) carried on the surface of the virus particle, influenza A virus can be divided into various subtypes. During seasonal epidemics, caused by H1N1 or H3N2 viruses, 5-10% of the worldwide population is infected, resulting in 3-5 million people suffering from severe illness and up to 500,000 deaths per year1,2. During the last influenza pandemic caused by H1N1pdm virus in 2009, it was estimated that the overall cumulative incidence of infection was 24% and as many as 284,500 people succumbed to H1N1pdm-related illness3,4 Additionally, avian influenza viruses, such as H7N9 and H5N1, are also reported to cause high mortality in humans yet do not transmit efficiently from human to human5,6. Vaccination is the primary strategy to prevent influenza virus infection. Currently, licensed influenza vaccines include whole inactivated influenza virus, split virus, subunit and virosomal vaccines7. These vaccines mainly induce influenza strain-specific antibodies which can bind to the virus surface proteins, HA and NA. However, due to the high variability of HA and NA the vaccines need to be reformulated each year to match the circulating influenza virus strains but still they are unable to protect against newly emerging strains. An influenza vaccine which can induce cross-protective immune responses to diverse influenza virus strains is therefore urgently needed. CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) to conserved influenza virus antigens, such as nucleoprotein (NP), are required for optimal cross-protective immune responses 8-10. Influenza virus-specific CTLs can clear virus-infected cells and subsequently stop virus replication and virus spread in the body. Therefore, inducing CTLs to conserved influenza virus protein is an attractive approach for eliciting cross-protective immunity against various influenza virus strains. Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) play a key role in priming CTL responses 11. Priming of CTLs by non-replicating vaccines and by pathogens which do not infect APCs directly, relies on a mechanism called cross-presentation12. Cross-presentation requires uptake by APCs of sufficient amounts of antigen which can enter the MHC class I processing and presentation pathway as well as proper activation of the APCs to trigger physiological processes involved in cross-presentation 11,12. A conserved protein, such as NP , alone is thus ineffective in inducing CD8+ T cell immunity due to its low capacity to reach the MHC class I processing pathway and its inability to activate APCs 13,14. Uptake of antigen by APCs can be facilitated by use of a delivery system. Influenza virosomes are reconstituted viral membrane envelopes which consist only of the membrane lipids and the surface proteins of influenza virus. Virosomes retain the cell binding and membrane fusion abilities of the live virus. Due to these properties, 4 MPLA-ajuvanted virosomes as cross-protective flu vaccine93InTRoDUCTI on Influenza A virus infections cause considerable mortality and morbidity to the human population during seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics.

Influenza virosomes are reconstituted viral membrane envelopes which consist only of the membrane lipids and the surface proteins of influenza virus. Virosomes retain the cell binding and membrane fusion abilities of the live virus. Due to these properties, 4 Chapter 494virosomes can deliver encapsulated cargo to the cytosol of APCs and subsequently induce CTL responses15. However, only limited amounts of protein can be encapsulated into virosomes when adding the protein during virosome reconstitution16. Moreover, due to a lack of adjuvant virosomes are inefficient in activating APCs and thus in triggering cross-presentation, which limits the induction of CTL immunity17. Increasing the amount of antigen associated with the virosomes and adding an adjuvant to enable APC activation and thus improve cross-presentation may significantly enhance the induction of CTLs. In this study, we used two strategies to modify influenza virosomes to overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks. Firstly, a nickel-chelating lipid was incorporated into the lipid bilayer of influenza virosomes. The presence of nickel-carrying lipids facilitates binding of large amounts of histidine (his)-tagged protein to the surface of lipid-based carriers 18. Secondly, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligand, was incorporated into the virosomal membrane19. TLR 4 engagement on APCs not only results in activation of the cells but can also promote cross-presentation20,21.

Briefly, BugBuster protein extraction reagent (Merck Millipore, Germany) with 6 M urea was used lysis transfected with binding buffer (0.1 M HEPES, 0.5 M NaCl) and then incubated with E.coli lysate at 4 oC overnight with rotation. The resin column was then washed twice with washing buffer (0.1 M HEPES, 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM imidazole). Then, 1.8 ml of elution buffer (0.1 M HEPES, 0.5 M NaCl, 400 mM imidazole) with 6 M urea were added and incubated with the column at room temperature for 10 min. After that, the eluted samples were collected and the presence of his-tagged protein was analyzed by SDS- PAGE on 10% gel stained with Coomassie blue. The purity of the proteins was more than 90% (supplementary Figure S1). An endotoxin removal resin column - Thermo Fisher, Germany - was used to remove residual endotoxin from these proteins. Determination of residual endotoxin revealed that 99% of endotoxin was removed by this procedure. After that, proteins were dialyzed against HEPES-buffered saline (HBS; 5 mM HEPES, 3 mM EDTA, 0.15 M NaCl, PH 7.4) to remove imidazole and urea. The concentrations of the proteins were determined by micro-Lowry22. The purified proteins were stored at 4oC until use.

Lung virus titers were determined by infection of MDCK cells in 96-well plates with serial dilutions of the lung supernatants as described before25. 2.11 ELISA and microneutralization assay Serum antibodies against the surface proteins of HK68 virus and antibody against NP protein were detected by ELISA as previously published 24. Briefly, 0.3 \u00b5g of HK68 subunit vaccine prepared as before or 0.3 \u00b5g of his-tagged NP protein was coated on 96-well plates overnight in 100 \u00b5l of coating buffer (0.05 M carbonate bicarbonate, pH 9.6-9.8). Then, plates were blocked with 200 \u00b5l of 2.5% milk powder solution in coating buffer for 45 min at 37\u00b0C. A series of two-fold diluted serum samples was then added to the plate and incubated for 1.5 h for 37 oC. Subsequently, horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG incubated for 1 h at 37oC. O-phenylene-diamine(OPD) was used as a substrate to react with HRP . The reaction was stopped by adding 50 \u00b5l of 2 M H2SO4. The plates were then read at 492 nm. IgG titers were calculated as the log value of the reciprocal of the dilution of serum sample corresponding to an OD492nm to 0.2. Microneutralization (MN) assay was performed as described previously25. Statistics Differences between read-outs of two different vaccination groups were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test. Survival difference was determined by log-rank test. P< 0.05 was considered as significantly different. ReSUlTS Incorporation of MP lA enhances the APC-activating capacity of modified virosomes MPLA has been tested as adjuvant because it can activate APCs through engagement with TLR4 expressed on the cell surface. We first determined whether the modified influenza virosomal vaccines can activate APCs utilizing the RAW-BlueTM cell line which stably expresses all TLRs (except TLR5) and contains a reporter gene, secreted 4 Chapter 498Aldrich, USA) and counted by AID Elispot reader (Autoimmune Diagnostika GmbH, Strassberg, Germany). The number of antigen-specific IFN- producing cells was calculated by subtracting the number of spots detected in the unstimulated samples from the number in stimulated samples. Virus titration in lung tissue Lung tissue collected at day 3 post challenge was homogenized in 1 ml of PBS and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 minutes. Supernatants were collected, aliquoted and stored at -80oC until use. Lung virus titers were determined by infection of MDCK cells in 96-well plates with serial dilutions of the lung supernatants as described before25. 2.11 ELISA and microneutralization assay Serum antibodies against the surface proteins of HK68 virus and antibody against NP protein were detected by ELISA as previously published 24.

ReSUlTS Incorporation of MP lA enhances the APC-activating capacity of modified virosomes MPLA has been tested as adjuvant because it can activate APCs through engagement with TLR4 expressed on the cell surface. We first determined whether the modified influenza virosomal vaccines can activate APCs utilizing the RAW-BlueTM cell line which stably expresses all TLRs (except TLR5) and contains a reporter gene, cultured with either influenza virosomes only (V), virosomes with incorporated MPLA DOGs-NTA-Ni (VNi+), or the TLR agonists CpG and LPS. As shown in Fig 1, the TLR ligands LPS and CpG, activated the NF-b signaling pathway resulting in the production of SEAP . M/V also strongly activated the RAW-BlueTM cells. In contrast, virosomes without MPLA (V, VNi+) failed to activate NF-b signaling. These results demonstrate that MPLA was successfully incorporated into virosomes enabling the virosomes to activate APCs in vitro . Moreover, VNi+ did not activate RAW-BlueTM cells indicating that presence of DOGs lipids alone is insufficient for activation of APCs. His-tagged protein is conjugated to modified virosomes To assess the conjugation of his-tagged protein to modified virosomes we incubated his-tagged EGFP with different types of modified virosomes. The presence of the histidine residues provides a tag that can bind with Ni+ chelating lipid. After mixing his-tagged EGFP the conjugation of protein to these modified virosomes was determined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. When incubating his-tagged EGFP Ni (VNi-), the fluorescence of his-tagged EGFP was mainly detected in the top fraction while virosomal protein was mainly detected in the middle fraction of the gradient (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, virosomal and fluorescent protein migrated to the same fractions of the gradient when his-tagged EGFP was incubated with VNi+ (Fig. 2 B). This indicates that the presence of Ni+ is crucial for the conjugation of his-tagged protein to virosomes. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2 C, after incubating his-tagged EGFP with M/VNi+, protein and fluorescence signal also migrated together to the same fractions of the gradient, which demonstrates that incorporation of MPLA into virosome did not interfere with the conjugation of his-tagged protein to membrane-incorporated DOGS-NTA-Ni. To determine the binding capacity of M/VNi+ for his-tagged protein, a fixed amount of M/VNi+ virosomes was incubated with different amounts of his-tagged EGFP as indicated in Material & Methods. The conjugation of his-tagged protein to the virosomes was then analyzed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Protein and fluorescent signals from different fractions of the sucrose gradient showed that all the his-tagged EGFP co-migrated with the virosomal protein to the same fraction of the sucrose gradient when the ratio of virosomal protein to his-tagged EGFP was 1:2 or 1:4 (Fig 2 D and E). In contrast, a strong fluorescent signal was found in the top fractions of the gradient when the ratio of virosomal protein : EGFP was 1:8, indicating that only part of the his-tagged EGFP was conjugated to M/VNi+ under those conditions cultured with either influenza virosomes only (V), virosomes with incorporated MPLA DOGs-NTA-Ni (VNi+), or the TLR agonists CpG and LPS. As shown in Fig 1, the TLR ligands LPS and CpG, activated the NF-b signaling pathway resulting in the production of SEAP . M/V also strongly activated the RAW-BlueTM cells.

In contrast, a strong fluorescent signal was found in the top fractions of the gradient when the ratio of virosomal protein : EGFP was 1:8, indicating that only part of the his-tagged EGFP was conjugated to M/VNi+ under those conditions (Fig 2 4 Chapter 4100F). M/VNi+ showed similar conjugation capacity for his-tagged NP protein. At virosomal protein: NP ratios of 1:2 and 1:3 all NP was bound to the virosomes but at a ratio of 1:5 NP started to appear in the top fraction of the gradient (supplementary Figure S2). Taken together, M/VNi+ showed high conjugation efficacy for his-tagged proteins. Modified virosomes facilitate the uptake of conjugated his-tagged protein by APCs We hypothesized that conjugation of a protein to influenza virosomes will facilitate its uptake by APCs. The uptake of his-tagged protein by APCs was determined by incubating M/VNi+-EGFP or free EGFP protein with RAW-BlueTM cells and quantification of internalized EGFP by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig 3, after 1 h incubation, free EGFP was not internalized efficiently by RAW-BlueTM cells. However, EGFP conjugated to virosomes was readily taken up by RAW-BlueTM cells, as indicated by a marked increase in mean fluorescence intensity. Moreover, higher amounts of the M/VNi+-EGFP resulted in more uptake by APCs. These results indicate that conjugation of his-tagged protein to virosomes enhances antigen uptake by APCs. Virosomes with associated nP induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes and nP-specific antibodies We next evaluated the immunogenic properties of the modified virosomes in vivo . We hypothesized that attachment of NP and incorporation of MPLA into virosome would facilitate the cross-presentation of NP thereby allowing induction of NP-specific CTLs which could aid in protection from virus challenge. Moreover, immunization with modified virosomes with NP was expected to induce NP-specific antibodies. Modified virosomes were prepared from NC99 (H1N1) while NP protein was derived from HK68 (H3N2). C57BL/6 mice were primed and boosted with either M/VNi- + NP , M/ VNi+-NP , free NP mixed with MPLA or M/V on day 0 and day 21. Control animals received PBS. To identify NP-specific IFN- producing cells against HK68 NP , the NP366-374 epitope (ASNENM DAM) present in HK68 NP but absent from NC99 virus was used to stimulate mouse splenocytes. As indicated in Fig 4 A, only M/VNi+-NP induced significant numbers of NP-specific IFN- producing T cells while the number of NP-specific CTLs found after immunization with M/VNi- + NP , M/VNi+ or free NP protein mixed with MPLA was not significantly different from the number observed in PBS control mice. To detect NP-specific antibody responses, mouse serum samples taken 3 days post challenge were analyzed by ELISA. As shown in Fig 4 B, NP-specific antibody titers in each of the NP-vaccinated groups (M/VNi- + NP , M/VNi+-NP and NP+MPLA), were significantly higher than in the PBS control group. Moreover, M/VNi- + NP and M/VNi+-NP 4 Chapter 4100F). M/VNi+ showed similar conjugation capacity for his-tagged NP protein. At virosomal protein: NP ratios of 1:2 and 1:3 all NP was bound to the virosomes but at a ratio of 1:5 NP started to appear in the top fraction of the gradient (supplementary Figure S2).

Moreover, immunization with modified virosomes with NP was expected to induce NP-specific antibodies. Modified virosomes were prepared from NC99 (H1N1) while NP protein was derived from HK68 (H3N2). C57BL/6 mice were primed and boosted with either M/VNi- + NP , M/ VNi+-NP , free NP mixed with MPLA or M/V on day 0 and day 21. Control animals received PBS.

To detect NP-specific antibody responses, mouse serum samples taken 3 days post challenge were analyzed by ELISA. As shown in Fig 4 B, NP-specific antibody titers in each of the NP-vaccinated groups (M/VNi- + NP , M/VNi+-NP and NP+MPLA), were significantly higher than in the PBS control group. Moreover, M/VNi- + NP and M/VNi+-NP 4 MPLA-ajuvanted virosomes as cross-protective flu vaccine101vaccination induced higher levels of NP-specific antibodies compared to vaccination with MPLA-adjuvanted free NP . Virosomal vaccines induce cross-protective immunity against virus infection Next, the protective potential of the modified virosome vaccines against heterosubtypic virus infection was determined. Mice were vaccinated twice as described above with modified NC99 (H1N1)-derived virosomes with admixed or attached HK68 NP HK68 NP + MPLA or with plain virosomes and were subsequently challenged with a lethal dose of HK68 (H3N2) virus. After virus challenge, five out of six mice in the PBS control group developed severe symptoms and lost more than 20% weight (humane endpoint) necessitating euthanasia on day 7 or 8 post infection (Fig. 5 A, B). Mice that were immunized with the mixture of NP protein and MPLA showed more rapid weight loss than mice in the PBS control group, but three mice in this group started to recover from day 5 post infection onwards. In the M/VNi- + NP vaccinated group, four out of six mice showed rapid weight loss as observed in the NP + MPLA group. However, these mice started to recover from day 7 post infection and none of the mice needed to be sacrificed. In the M/VNi+-NP vaccinated group, one out of six mice had to be sacrificed on day 5 post infection. The other five mice started to recover by day 6 or day 7 post infection after a period of moderate weight loss. Surprisingly, in the M/V vaccinated group, mice only showed mild weight loss (around 10%) and all mice recovered quickly. Determination of virus in lung tissue on day 3 post-infection revealed almost identical mean virus titers of about 10log 4.5 for all experimental groups (Supplementary Fig.3). Thus, infection and initial virus growth were not affected by any of the vaccines. To explore the possible mechanisms responsible for cross-protection, sera collected on day 3 post infection from vaccinated mice were evaluated for antibodies recognizing HK68 virus. As shown in Fig.6 A, MPLA-adjuvanted virosomes derived from NC99 virus readily induced IgG cross-reactive with HK68 surface proteins (HA + NA) in an ELISA assay. However, these antibodies were unable to neutralize HK68 virus particles (Fig. 6 B). Taken together, these results indicate that virosomes with conjugated NP could elicit the production of NP-specific CTLs and NP-specific antibodies. However, NP- specific immunity was not required for protection from severe disease symptoms upon challenge and might even have resulted in immunopathology. Thus, immunization with (NP) virosomes protected mice against infection with heterosubtypic HK68 virus by a so far non-identified mechanism. 4 MPLA-ajuvanted virosomes as cross-protective flu vaccine101vaccination induced higher levels of NP-specific antibodies compared to vaccination with MPLA-adjuvanted free NP . Virosomal vaccines induce cross-protective immunity against virus infection Next, the protective potential of the modified virosome vaccines against heterosubtypic virus infection was determined.

As shown in Fig.6 A, MPLA-adjuvanted virosomes derived from NC99 virus readily induced IgG cross-reactive with HK68 surface proteins (HA + NA) in an ELISA assay. However, these antibodies were unable to neutralize HK68 virus particles (Fig. 6 B). Taken together, these results indicate that virosomes with conjugated NP could elicit the production of NP-specific CTLs and NP-specific antibodies. However, NP- specific immunity was not required for protection from severe disease symptoms upon challenge and might even have resulted in immunopathology. Thus, immunization with (NP) virosomes protected mice against infection with heterosubtypic HK68 virus by a so far non-identified mechanism. 4 Chapter 4102DISCUSSI on In this study, we developed a novel virosomal influenza vaccine, aiming to enhance the generation of influenza-specific CD8 T cell responses against the NP antigen. To this end, MPLA and DOGs-NTA-Ni lipid were incorporated into the lipid bilayers of influenza virosomes. In vitro , M/V strongly activated cells. M/VNi+ exhibited high conjugation ability to his-tagged EGFP or NP protein and significantly enhanced the uptake of his-tagged protein by APCs. Furthermore, while virosomes with admixed or conjugated NP induced equal levels of NP-specific antibodies, only virosomes with conjugated NP mounted an NP-specific CD8 T cell response. Yet, upon live virus challenge NP-specific immunity was not required for protection since MPLA-adjuvanted virosomes without NP provided the best protection. Activation of APCs is a prerequisite for efficient induction of CTLs by cross- presentation. We found that virosomes with incorporated MPLA exhibited a stronger ability to activate RAW-BlueTM cells than plain virosomes. Incorporation of MPLA into membranous delivery systems has been described before. A study reported that incorporation of MPLA into virosomes derived from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) strongly enhanced the ability of the virosomes to activate mouse APCs19. Another study reported that incorporation of MPLA into glycoliposomes not only induces DC maturation, but also enhances cross-presentation of liposome-conjugated tumor antigen to CD8 T cells26. Activation of APCs by membrane-incorporated MPLA induces the expression of co-stimulatory molecules on the cell surface and increases cytokine release19,26,27 thereby enabling efficient generation of CD8 T cell immunity. Next to proper activation of APCs, an important prerequisite for the induction of CTLs by non-living vaccines is the delivery of sufficient antigen to the cells. Antigen delivery depends on adequate loading of antigen in or on the delivery device and efficient uptake of the loaded delivery device by APCs. We show that incorporation of DOGS-NTA-Ni into influenza virosomes significantly enhanced the conjugation of his- tagged EGFP or NP to virosomes (Fig 2). DOGS-NTA-Ni was earlier shown to significantly increase the association of therapeutically active his-tagged peptides to liposomes without influencing the biological function of these peptides18. Another study reported by Masek et al demonstrates that DOGS-NTA-Ni facilitates the attachment of his- tagged heat shock protein from Candida albicans (hsp90-CA) onto liposome28. We used DOGS-NTA-Ni lipid for the first time with virosomes which have a membrane that is densely covered with viral surface proteins. Nevertheless, presence of DOGS-NTA-Ni allowed the conjugation of large amounts of protein to the virosomes indicating that the presence of the viral surface proteins did not sterically hinder binding of his-tagged protein. Originally, passive encapsulation was used to generate protein- or peptide- carrying influenza virosomes16,17. However, only approximately 225 ovalbumin (OVA) 4 Chapter 4102DISCUSSI on In this study, we developed a novel virosomal influenza vaccine, aiming to enhance the generation of influenza-specific CD8 T cell responses against the NP antigen.

Originally, passive encapsulation was used to generate protein- or peptide- carrying influenza virosomes16,17. However, only approximately 225 ovalbumin (OVA) 4 MPLA-ajuvanted virosomes as cross-protective flu vaccine103molecules could be encapsulated per virosomal particle using this technique16. In contrast, we estimate that one particle of DOGS-NTA-Ni-containing virosomes could conjugate with about 27500 4 \u00b5g EGFP/ \u00b5g virosomal protein) or to 3 \u00b5g NP/ \u00b5g virosomal protein). Thus, the incorporation of DOGS-NTA-Ni facilitated binding of approximately 50 times more NP protein than could have been achieved by passive encapsulation. Interaction of antigen and delivery system is important for the uptake of antigen by APCs and induction of antigen-specific CTLs. We demonstrate that the conjugation of his-tagged EGFP to the membrane of M/VNi+ significantly enhanced the uptake of the protein by APCs. Our results are in line with those reported by Soema et al who show that encapsulation of M1 peptide in virosomes strongly increased the uptake of the peptide by DCs in vitro17. Another study demonstrates that loading melanoma tumor antigen gp100 peptide to MPLA-incorporating glycoliposomes to CD8 T cells26. In vivo experiments confirmed our concept that modified virosomes combining activation of APCs with efficient antigen delivery have the potential to effectively activate CD8 T cells. Indeed, we observed that M/VNi+-NP induced NP-specific CD8 T cells while free NP with MPLA or M/VNi- + NP did not or to a much lower extent. In contrast, induction of NP-specific antibodies was independent of conjugation of NP to virosomes. Different vaccination strategies have been developed to generate influenza-specific CD8 T cells. These strategies include DNA vaccine, viral vector vaccine, peptide vaccine and others [for review see29 ]. Conserved T cell epitopes present in peptide vaccines or expressed by DNA vaccines or viral vector vaccines could induce influenza-specific CD8 T cells in vivo. Yet, so far the number of CD8 T cells that could be induced by these vaccines in humans was very moderate (reviewed in 30). Accordingly, in some cases, eg the MVA-NP+M1 vaccine and the peptide vaccine Multimeric-001, the vaccine is not used alone but rather as in combination with or as priming for immunization with conventional inactivated influenza vaccine ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/ NCT03300362 )31. Compared with these vaccination strategies, M/VNi+-NP , consisting of virosomes which present the viral surface proteins and harbor conserved NP , have the potential to induce not only influenza-specific CD8 T cells but also cross-reactive antibodies. In line with others working on CD8 T cell inducing influenza vaccines we hypothesized that CTL induction by virosomes would result in mitigation of disease symptoms upon infection by allowing rapid virus clearance. M/VNi+-NP immunization indeed provided a certain level of cross-protective immune response against heterosubtypic (HK68) virus infection. Yet, a similar level of cross-protection was achieved with M/VNi- + NP which 4 MPLA-ajuvanted virosomes as cross-protective flu vaccine103molecules could be encapsulated per virosomal particle using this technique16. In contrast, we estimate that one particle of DOGS-NTA-Ni-containing virosomes could conjugate with about 27500 4 \u00b5g EGFP/ \u00b5g virosomal protein) or to 3 \u00b5g NP/ \u00b5g virosomal protein).

Compared with these vaccination strategies, M/VNi+-NP , consisting of virosomes which present the viral surface proteins and harbor conserved NP , have the potential to induce not only influenza-specific CD8 T cells but also cross-reactive antibodies. In line with others working on CD8 T cell inducing influenza vaccines we hypothesized that CTL induction by virosomes would result in mitigation of disease symptoms upon infection by allowing rapid virus clearance. M/VNi+-NP immunization indeed provided a certain level of cross-protective immune response against heterosubtypic (HK68) virus infection. Yet, a similar level of cross-protection was achieved with M/VNi- + NP which 4 Chapter 4104did not induce significant NP-specific CD8 T cells. This result implies that NP-specific CD8 T cells were not crucial for cross-protective immunity afforded by the virosomes. Moreover, immunization with M/V in the absence of NP provided the best cross- protection against heterosubtypic virus infection, suggesting that antibodies or T helper cells recognizing HA or NA were responsible for the observed mitigation of disease symptoms. No neutralizing antibodies against the challenge virus were detected, but non-neutralizing antibodies against the surface proteins (HA+NA) and NP protein were present in the vaccinated animals. It is possible that these non-neutralizing antibodies provided cross-protection for example via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)32. It is striking that the presence of NP-specific immunity seemed to have a negative rather than a positive effect during the initial phase of the infection: mice immunized with NP/MPLA showed a more rapid decline in weight than PBS control mice and mice immunized with virosomes with admixed or conjugated NP were less well protected than mice receiving virosomes without NP . The reason for this phenomenon is not clear. We consider it unlikely that the observed immunopathology was caused by NP-specific CTLs as CTLs recognizing the immuno-dominant NP366-374 epitope were not induced by NP + MPLA and M/VNi- + NP . It remains elusive whether NP-specific antibodies or T helper cells or both were responsible for the observed enhanced disease symptoms. In conclusion, we developed \"all-in-one\" influenza virosomes, with MPLA and DOGS-NTA-Ni incorporated in the membrane and NP protein conjugated on the surface. These \"all-in-one\" virosomes could activate APCs and enhance the uptake of NP protein by APCs in vitro and favored the generation of NP-specific CD8 T cell responses in vivo . CTLs were not involved in heterosubtypic cross-protection in this study, our results provide a basis for the use of MPLA-adjuvanted influenza virosomes containing DOGS-NTA-Ni lipid as platform for a universal influenza vaccine.

This result implies that NP-specific CD8 T cells were not crucial for cross-protective immunity afforded by the virosomes. Moreover, immunization with M/V in the absence of NP provided the best cross- protection against heterosubtypic virus infection, suggesting that antibodies or T helper cells recognizing HA or NA were responsible for the observed mitigation of disease symptoms. No neutralizing antibodies against the challenge virus were detected, but non-neutralizing antibodies against the surface proteins (HA+NA) and NP protein were present in the vaccinated animals.

To be submitted to PlosOne.Chapter 5 Experiences of using the cotton rat model for influenza vaccine evaluation Yoshita Bhide1, Wei Dong1, of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Medical Microbiology, Groningen, The Netherlands. To be submitted to PlosOne.Chapter 5 Chapter 5116AbSTRACT Cotton rats have successfully been infected with clinical strains of influenza viruses without pre-adaptation of the virus like required for mice. Disease symptoms and course of the infection have been studied in detail. Cotton rats have also been used to evaluate influenza vaccines. However, information on advantages and disadvantages of using this model and on points to consider while exploiting this model for influenza vaccine evaluation is limited. Here we show with whole inactivated virus (WIV) influenza vaccine that a single intramuscular immunization with a dose of 0.5 \u00b5g was immunogenic in cotton rats. Administration of a booster dose significantly increased the humoral immune response. To evaluate protective efficacy, cotton rats were challenged with a clinical isolate of H1N1pdm virus. Non-vaccinated animals were highly susceptible for the infection, presented with high lung virus load on day one and three post challenge and half of the animals succumbed quickly without showing signs of sickness reliably predicting the rapid death. In contrast, vaccinated cotton rats had low or undetectable lung virus titers and two out of four animals of the 0.5 \u00b5g group survived the challenge. In spite of low lung virus titers and less pronounced induction of IFN upon challenge, most vaccinated animals showed increase in breathing frequency though in some cases this increase was of shorter duration than in non-vaccinated animals. Our data suggests that cotton rats are a suitable animal model for influenza infection and vaccine evaluation but careful fine tuning of the experimental parameters is required. Key words: Cotton rats, whole inactivated virus (WIV) influenza vaccine, humoral immune response, virus challenge, lung viral load, breathing frequency. 5 Chapter 5116AbSTRACT Cotton rats have successfully been infected with clinical strains of influenza viruses without pre-adaptation of the virus like required for mice.

In spite of low lung virus titers and less pronounced induction of IFN upon challenge, most vaccinated animals showed increase in breathing frequency though in some cases this increase was of shorter duration than in non-vaccinated animals. Our data suggests that cotton rats are a suitable animal model for influenza infection and vaccine evaluation but careful fine tuning of the experimental parameters is required. Key words: Cotton rats, whole inactivated virus (WIV) influenza vaccine, humoral immune response, virus challenge, lung viral load, breathing frequency. 5 Cotton rat model for influenza vaccine evaluation117InTRoDUCTI on Cotton rats ( Sigmodon hispidus ) have been used as a small animal model for respiratory virus infections such as human parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), measles virus, human metapneumovirus and as well as for influenza virus infection and pathogenesis studies 1-7. All these respiratory viruses can easily replicate in cotton rats and induce pathogenesis similar to that in humans. Unlike mice, cotton rats are susceptible to clinical isolates of influenza virus without prior adaptation of the virus 4,8,9. Indeed, cotton rats have been infected successfully with a broad range of clinical influenza virus strains4,6,10. Upon infection, cotton rats show easily quantifiable disease symptoms like increased breathing frequency, reduced body weight and decreased body temperature1112. Despite the positive results with cotton rats as a model for influenza infection, there is so far limited information on the performance of influenza vaccines in cotton rats. Early studies evaluated the effect of infection-induced immunity on subsequent challenge with homologous or heterologous virus strains 13,14. Later the studies were extended to UV-inactivated virus, seasonal trivalent split vaccine and more recently recombinant adenovirus vaccines and AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic influenza vaccine 11,12,15-17. Some of these studies report on reduced increase in breathing frequency (BF) in immunized versus na\u00efve cotton rats upon challenge13 15. Some studies investigated additional parameters like lung virus titers and lung pathology and/or determined induction of antibodies. However, none of the studies gives a complete description of clinical symptoms like changes in weight and temperature. Moreover, none of the studies describes evaluation of vaccines against H1N1pdm virus, a clinically highly relevant virus which is still in circulation. The aim of this study was to obtain more detailed insight in the advantages and disadvantages of cotton rats for the evaluation of influenza vaccine candidates against a clinically relevant virus. To this end, we immunized cotton rats once or twice with different doses of a whole inactivated virus (WIV) influenza vaccine derived from a H1N1pdm vaccine strain and challenged the animals with a clinical isolate of H1N1pdm. Antibody titers in immunized animals correlated with vaccine dose and were boosted by a second immunization. Upon challenge, some animals of the non-immunized control group and the low dose immunization group succumbed quickly without prior overt signs of their poor condition. In the surviving immunized animals, lung virus titers on day one post challenge were strongly reduced as compared to titers in control animals. Yet, immunization had limited effects on clinical symptoms like tachypnea and disease parameters or on induction of cytokines and Mx1 in the lungs. We conclude that cotton rats are useful for evaluating protective effects of influenza vaccines but experimental conditions have to be fine-tuned and readout parameters have to be chosen carefully. 5 Cotton rat model for influenza vaccine evaluation117InTRoDUCTI on Cotton rats ( Sigmodon hispidus ) have been used as a small animal model for respiratory virus infections such as human parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), measles virus, human metapneumovirus and as well as for influenza virus infection and pathogenesis studies 1-7.

The virus was inactivated by overnight treatment with 0.1% -propiolactone (Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium) in citrate buffer (125 sodiumcitrate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 8.2) at 4\u00b0C to produce whole inactivated virus (WIV) vaccine. Inactivation was followed by dialysis against HNE buffer (145 mM NaCl, 5 mM Hepes, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, sterilized by autoclaving). Inactivation of the virus was verified by inoculation of MDCK cells and the amount of protein was determined by micro-Lowry assay.

Cotton rats were vaccinated via the intramuscular (i.m.) route with 100 \u00b5l vaccine distributed over the hind limbs. Four weeks after the single immunization in Experiment 1 or the 2nd immunization in Experiment 2, cotton rats were challenged with A/Cal/Gro, 5*107 TCID50 in Experiment 1 and 1*107 TCID50 in Experiment 2. Inoculation doses were chosen on basis of the literature (Blanco et al., 2013) and were tested in cotton rats prior to the immunization/challenge experiments.

Both vaccination and challenge were 5 Cotton rat model for influenza vaccine evaluation119carried out under 5% isoflurane/O2 anaesthesia. The two non-treated control animals in Experiment 2 received neither vaccination nor challenge. For Experiment 1, various clinical symptoms were assessed and the animals were sacrificed three days post challenge. For Experiment 2, one day after the challenge half of the cotton rats from the vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups were sacrificed for the assessment of lung virus titers and systemic immune responses. The remaining animals were followed for ten days for assessment of clinical symptoms. Assessment of clinical symptoms and sample collection After challenge, cotton rats were followed daily for determination of changes in weight, temperature and breathing frequency for three days in the 1st experiment and ten days in the 2nd experiment. Animals were weighed by catching them into a pre-weighed cardboard roll. Weight loss of 10% in one day or 15% from the day of challenge was considered as criteria for the humane endpoint. Ten days post challenge the remaining cotton rats were sacrificed. Breathing frequency (BF) was measured by plethysmography as described previously 21. Briefly, the animal was placed in a 1,500 ml air-tight but transparent tube of a whole-body plethysmograph which was connected to a pressure transducer. The frequency of pressure changes inside the tube was recorded and displayed as breaths per minute (bpm). A mean BF of an animal was then calculated from a minimum of four steady regions lasting for at least 15 seconds. For many of the animals, if they breathed at a constant rate we even recorded breathing for a minute or more consecutively. Maximal variation between the readings was +/- 5 to 10 breathes/minute, thus about 1-3%. Temperature was measured while the animal was restrained in the cardboard container using a DAS-7008/9 detector for s.c. injected electronic ID transponders (BMDS, Seaford, USA). Blood was drawn on the day(s) of immunization, the day of challenge and the days of sacrifice. Serum was separated and stored at -20\u00b0C until assessment of IgG, neutralizing (MN) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies. A small part of the same lung was stored in RNAlater (QIAgen, The Netherlands) for cytokine profiling by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). lung virus titration Equally sized parts of the lungs were collected in 1 ml complete EPISERF medium (100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and were homogenized, centrifuged and the supernatants were used for determination of viral load in the lungs as described previously 18.

IgG and IgA elISA IgG ELISA was performed by coating ELISA plates (Greiner Bio One, Alphen a/d Rijn, The of A/PR/8, or X-31 WIV in coating buffer mM Na2CO3, 22.5 mM NaHCO3, pH9.6) overnight at 37\u00b0C. ELISA was done as described previously 22. IgG titers were calculated as log10 of the reciprocal of the sample dilution corresponding to an absorbance of 0.2 at the wavelength of 492 nm. Limit of detection (LoD) was calculated using the 1st dilution made and the negative samples were given half the value of the LoD value. Microneutralization assay (M n) and Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) Serum samples taken on the day of the 2nd immunization, the day of challenge and ten days post challenge were assessed for MN and HI antibodies against A/California/2009 virus using a previously described protocol 22,23 respectively. Titers are presented as log2 HI titers for individual cotton rats. Limit of detection (LoD) was calculated using the 1st dilution made and the negative samples were given half the value of the LoD value. Cytokine measurement by qRT-PCR For determination of cytokine expression in the lungs, lungs stored in RNAlater were homogenized using a pestle and RNA was extracted with the help of the QIAGEN RNeasy extraction mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Netherlands) Supplementary Table 1). Primers were designed with help of the program Primer Blast, using cotton rat sequences from NCBI BLAST\u00ae. The specificity of the primers was validated by checking if there was a single melt curve for all samples tested. GAPDH was used as a house keeping gene. PCR cycling conditions were set as 10 min 95 \u00b0C followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec 95\u00b0C and 1 min 60\u00b0C on an Applied Biosystems' StepOnePlus real time PCR system. SYBR green ROX-mix used was from Westburg (Leusden, Netherlands). For analysis, mean CT values of GAPDH per sample was subtracted from the mean CT values of the cytokine for the same animal to calculate delta CT values. Delta delta CT values were then calculated by subtracting delta CT of the non-treated cotton rats from delta CT of the vaccinated and non-vaccinated cotton rats that were challenged 5 Chapter 5120Limit of detection (LoD) was calculated using the 1st dilution made; negative samples were assigned a value corresponding to half of the LoD value for calculation purposes.

The fold change was then calculated. Cytokines are represented as log2 fold change in vaccinated and non-vaccinated cotton rats with respect to non-treated cotton rat. Statistics The statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 5 software with which the graphs were plotted as well. Non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was used to test if the differences between two groups i.e. vaccinated and non-vaccinated cotton rats, with respect to different parameters were significant. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. ReSUlTS effect of a single immunization on clinical symptoms after virus challenge. In order to assess the effect of vaccination on disease symptoms and lung virus growth, in a first experiment cotton rats were i.m. injected with a single dose of either PBS, 0.5 \u00b5g, 1 \u00b5g or 5 \u00b5g WIV followed by homologous challenge with a dose of 5x107 TCID50 H1N1pdm 30 days later. Upon challenge clinical symptoms like weight loss, breathing frequency and temperature were assessed for three days in vaccinated and non- vaccinated cotton rats. Two animals from the PBS control group were found dead on day three post challenge. The two remaining cotton rats from the PBS group did not show considerable weight loss on day one post challenge; however their weight reduced over the next two days (Fig. 1A). Two cotton rats from the 0.5 \u00b5g WIV group were found dead on day two post challenge, the other animals from this group did not show much weight loss (Fig. 1B). Animals from the 1 \u00b5g and 5 \u00b5g WIV groups lost no or little weight (Fig. 1C and 1D respectively). The two remaining animals from the PBS control group showed a slight drop in temperature (Fig. 1E). Temperature was not affected by the virus infection in the animals from the 0.5 \u00b5g, 1 \u00b5g and 5 \u00b5g WIV groups (Fig. 1F, 1G and 1H respectively). All four cotton rats from the PBS control group presented with a significant increase in breathing frequency (BF) on day two post challenge and then BF started to normalize (Fig. 1I). Also, all the animals in the 0.5 \u00b5g WIV group showed increase in breathing frequency on day two (Figure 1J). While two of the animals in the 1 \u00b5g WIV group demonstrated a marked and sustained increase in BF post challenge, the remaining two animals presented with only moderately increased BF which returned to normal values by day three (Figure 1K). Cotton rats in the 5 \u00b5g WIV group also showed increased 5 Cotton rat model for influenza vaccine evaluation121and killed on day one and day ten post challenge.

While two of the animals in the 1 \u00b5g WIV group demonstrated a marked and sustained increase in BF post challenge, the remaining two animals presented with only moderately increased BF which returned to normal values by day three (Figure 1K). Cotton rats in the 5 \u00b5g WIV group also showed increased 5 Chapter 5122breathing on day 1 post challenge. However, on day two, BF in these animals started to decrease and was significantly lower than the BF in the mock-immunized control animals on day two (*p = 0.0286). For 3 of the 4 animals the BF came to the baseline on day three (Figure 1L). Hence, breathing frequency was the most sensitive parameter of infection in the used cotton rat model. In conclusion, immunization with a sufficiently high dose of WIV prevented infection-induced death of the cotton rats but provided limited protection against clinical symptoms. Some of the control animals and of the 0.5 ug WIV group died rapidly without prior overt signs of distress. effect of a single immunization on lung virus titers. To assess the effect of the immunization on virus growth, immunized and PBS treated animals were sacrificed three days post challenge to evaluate lung virus titers. Since two animals from each the PBS treated and the 0.5 \u00b5g WIV groups were found dead before day three virus titers could not be retrieved from them. The two surviving cotton rats from the PBS group showed titers of 103.2/ml and 103.5/ml, respectively. Of the surviving animals from the 0.5 \u00b5g WIV group one had a low virus titer of 102.8/ml while the other had no detectable virus in the lung. Animals vaccinated with 1 \u00b5g or 5 \u00b5g WIV were all free of virus in the lungs three days post infection (Fig. 2). No virus was found in the nose of any of the animals. Thus, even a single vaccination resulted in restricted virus growth in the lungs upon challenge. Systemic immune response after a single vaccination. To assess the systemic immune response induced by WIV, serum IgG titers were evaluated by ELISA on the day of immunization and the day of challenge. On the day of immunization all cotton rats were sero-negative for influenza (data not shown). On the day of challenge, all vaccinated cotton rats had developed antibodies with a titer of 103 or higher. Compared to IgG titers induced by 0.5 \u00b5g WIV, significantly higher IgG titers were induced by 1 and 5 \u00b5g WIV (Fig. 3). Yet, the differences were rather small (about 2.5 fold). Thus, all vaccine doses induced robust serum IgG responses upon a single vaccination. effects of prime/boost vaccination on clinical symptoms post challenge. Since a single immunization protected from virus growth but not from clinical symptoms we next assessed whether the protection provided by WIV could be improved by giving a booster vaccination. For this purpose, in the 2nd experiment cotton rats were 5 Chapter 5122breathing on day 1 post challenge.

For this purpose, in the 2nd experiment cotton rats were 5 Cotton rat model for influenza vaccine evaluation123vaccinated twice with 1 \u00b5g NIBRG-121 WIV with a 21-day interval. 30 days after the 2nd vaccination, the cotton rats were challenged with 1x107 TCID50 of homologous A/Cal/ Gro. The lower challenge dose compared to the 1st experiment was chosen in order to slow down the disease process. Upon challenge, animals were followed daily for ten days for changes in weight, temperature and breathing frequency. Despite of the five-fold lower virus challenge dose, two of the four mock-vaccinated cotton rats were found dead in the cage on day three and four post challenge. The remaining two cotton rats from the control group displayed minor weight loss but survived until the end of the follow-up period (Fig.4A). Cotton rats vaccinated twice with 1 \u00b5g WIV lost some weight on day two post challenge (Fig.4B) and thereafter the weights were stable till sacrifice. Interestingly, two control cotton rats which were neither vaccinated nor challenged also lost also some weight over time (Fig.4 C) and did not regain it, which might suggest that daily handling caused a stress response affecting eating or drinking behavior. Temperature was not affected in the infected animals except for one of the mock-vaccinated cotton rats which showed a decline in temperature one day before death (Fig. 4D-F). All of the mock-vaccinated cotton rats showed a significant increase in BF between the day of challenge and day two post challenge, indicating successful infection (Fig. 4G). One of the four cotton rats reached a BF of around 460 and was found dead two days later. Cotton rats vaccinated with 1 \u00b5g WIV also presented with significantly higher BF on day two post challenge as compared to the day of challenge (Fig. 4H). There was no statistically significant difference in BF between mock-vaccinated and vaccinated animals in this experiment (p=1.0000). After day two, BF started to return to normal. Non-treated cotton rats did not show much change in the breathing frequency compared to their baseline breathing frequency (Fig.4I). effect of prime/boost vaccination on lung virus titers after challenge. One day post challenge, half of the animals from the vaccinated and the mock-vaccinated group were sacrificed to evaluate the viral load in the lungs. Lungs of the sacrificed cotton rats were homogenized and the supernatants were used for determination of the TCID50 in MDCK cells. All cotton rats from the mock-vaccinated group had virus in their lungs, with a mean titer of 105.51/ml (Fig.5). In contrast, out of four immunized cotton rats, two did not show detectable virus and the remaining two showed reduced titers (101 and 103.8) as compared to the virus titers in non-vaccinated cotton rats (lowest titer: 104.4). Thus, vaccination provided significant protection (p=0.0294) from virus growth in the lungs as observed in the previous experiment. 5 Cotton rat model for influenza vaccine evaluation123vaccinated twice with 1 \u00b5g NIBRG-121 WIV with a 21-day interval. 30 days after the 2nd vaccination, the cotton rats were challenged with 1x107 TCID50 of homologous A/Cal/ Gro. The lower challenge dose compared to the 1st experiment was chosen in order to slow down the disease process. Upon challenge, animals were followed daily for ten days for changes in weight, temperature and breathing frequency. Despite of the five-fold lower virus challenge dose, two of the four mock-vaccinated cotton rats were found dead in the cage on day three and four post challenge. The remaining two cotton rats from the control group displayed minor weight loss but survived until the end of the follow-up period (Fig.4A).

To measure the systemic immune response induced by immunization and/or infection, IgG ELISA was performed on the serum samples taken on the days of immunization (d0, d21), day of challenge (d50) and ten days post challenge (d61) from vaccinated as well as mock-vaccinated cotton rats. IgG titers were determined against homologous NIBRG-121. None of the animals showed any IgG titers in the beginning of the experiment (data not shown). Cotton rats from the 1 \u00b5g WIV group developed IgG titers of around 103.8 (Fig.6A) after the 1st immunization on day 21 which increased significantly after the 2nd vaccination. Interestingly, IgG titers further increased significantly upon challenge indicating a booster by the infection itself. For non-vaccinated cotton rats, there was no serum IgG on the day of challenge (Fig. 6B), but ten days post challenge virus-specific IgG was readily detectable in the two surviving animals confirming successful infection. To assess the cross-reactive potential of these IgG antibodies, ELISA was performed against heterologous A/PR/8 H1N1 and heterosubtypic X-31 H3N2. All with 1 \u00b5g WIV showed IgG responses to A/PR/8 but titers were about 1 log lower than those against the homologous virus (Fig. 6C). Two of the four vaccinated cotton rats showed also IgG to X-31 (Fig. 6D). Yet, responses to this heterosubtypic virus were much lower than responses to the homologous virus or were even below the detection limit. Assessment of functional potential of systemic antibodies by HI and Mn upon prime/boost vaccination. To assess the functional potential of serum IgG, hemagglutination inhibition homologus NIBRG-121. In line with the IgG antibody responses, HI (Fig. 7A) and MN (Fig. 7B) antibodies were induced after two vaccinations with 1 \u00b5g WIV and increased further after challenge. For non-vaccinated cotton rats, HI (Fig. 7C) and MN (Fig. 7D) antibodies were undetectable before challenge but were present 10 days post challenge although at lower levels than in vaccinated animals. We also checked for the cross-neutralizing potential of serum antibodies against A/PR/8 H1N1 and X-31 H3N2 virus. However, despite the presence of cross-reacting antibodies detected by ELISA these antibodies could not neutralize the heterologous and heterosubtypic viruses (results not shown). effect of prime/boost vaccination on infection-related expression of Mx and cytokine genes in the lung. To evaluate the effects of vaccination on expression of infection-related genes in lungs upon challenge, qRT-PCR was performed on mRNA isolated from lung tissue, mRNA derived from lungs of non-treated cotton rats was used to set the baseline expression. 5 Chapter 5124IgG responses after prime/boost vaccination and challenge.

Infection clearly led to increased expression of Mx1 1 day post challenge in both vaccinated and non- vaccinated cotton rats which had returned to normal or even less than normal levels by day 10 (Fig. 8 Mx1). On the contrary, Mx2 was strongly downregulated (around 5-fold) in cotton rats from both groups on day 1 post challenge (Fig. 8 Mx2), but reached baseline levels again by day 10. There was no difference in expression of Mx1 and Mx2 between non-vaccinated and vaccinated animals. Another response to influenza infection in cotton rats is the upregulation of cytokine expression 19. We observed that infection led to increased expression levels, particularly of IFN, IFN, IL1 and IL6 on day 1 post challenge. By day 10 expression of these cytokines had declined again though not in all cases to baseline (Fig. 8 IFN, IFN, IL1, IL6). While expression of afore mentioned cytokines clearly peaked shortly after infection and then declined again, expression of IL4 and IL12 did not show such a trend (Fig. 8 IL4, IL12). Vaccination did not have significant effects on cytokine expression. Only for IFN there was a trend to lower expression in vaccinated animals and IL4 expression was higher in 3 out of 4 vaccinated animals as compared to non-vaccinated animals on day one post challenge. DISCUSSI on In this study, we set out to get more insight into the pros and cons of using the cotton rat model for influenza vaccine evaluation, especially by closely monitoring the clinical symptoms in vaccinated cotton rats upon challenge. To this end, we immunized the animals with WIV derived from an H1N1pdm vaccine strain and subsequently infected them with a clinical isolate of H1N1pdm. We demonstrate that all immunized animals developed a humoral immune response against the virus strain. Above a dose of 0.5 \u00b5g antigen, a single immunization as well as prime/boost immunization had clear-cut effects on lung virus titer and survival but rather moderate effects on clinical symptoms upon challenge. Among the clinical parameters studied (weight loss, temperature, breathing frequency), we found that breathing frequency was the most sensitive parameter of infection. In contrast to previous studies we used outbred cotton rats and found variation among the animals acceptable 6,11,12,14,26. Moreover, the cotton rats used in our studies were fully grown when challenged (age at challenge ~20 weeks) as indicated by the fact that even non-infected animals did not gain weight during the study period. In previous studies, the age of the animals is often not well indicated but the fact that non-infected or protected animals gain about 30 g of weight during a 14-day study 5 Cotton rat model for influenza vaccine evaluation125Mx proteins can inhibit virus replication and have been described to be strongly induced in the lungs of influenza-infected cotton rats24 25.

In previous studies, the age of the animals is often not well indicated but the fact that non-infected or protected animals gain about 30 g of weight during a 14-day study 5 Chapter 5126period indicates that the animals used were still juvenile 25. We observed that young animals are much more susceptible to influenza infection than older ones (unpublished observations), thus age is an important parameter to consider in experimental design. We could readily detect virus in the lungs of the animals 1 or 3 days after virus inoculation confirming that the infection was successful. Some of the infected animals were found dead without having shown severe clinical symptoms during the last check-up. Autopsy revealed that these animals had massive inflammation of the lungs. Obviously, the animals can cope rather well even with severe infection but at a given moment deteriorated very quickly. From our observations, we did not get the impression that the sudden deterioration observed in some animals was related to the infection dose as it was observed for different virus doses. A possible explanation could be the virulence of this particular virus strain compared to other H1N1 viruses. Although, the challenge dose was reduced in the 2nd experiment we still saw this rapid deterioration indicating the higher virulence. We observed no or very little effect of the infection on weight and temperature in our experiments. This is in line with Blanco et al who previously reported that infection with H1N1pdm does not cause overt weight loss and/or drop in temperature in cotton rats, in contrast to infection with other influenza virus strains like H5N1, H3N2, and H9N2 25. H1N1pdm infection led, however, to a marked increase in the breathing frequency of the animals, which had not been reported earlier for this virus strain. The peak of increased BF was on day 2 post challenge which correlates with the peak of lung histopathology on day 2 as reported by Blanco et al 25. Increased BF as prominent disease symptom in cotton rats has also been described for other influenza virus strains and is thought to be caused by damage of epithelial cell layers and the resulting difficulties in breathing might cause death15. When investigating gene expression in the lungs of infected cotton rats we found among others an upregulation in the IFN and Mx1 mRNA indicating induction of an antiviral response. Increased expression of IFN and Mx1 has been reported earlier 19,20,25,27. IFN mediates antiviral responses against influenza by induction of Mx genes and other response modifiers 28. In cotton rats, IFN expression was found to correlate with replicating virus in the lungs 24. Interestingly we observed a strong down-regulation in Mx2 mRNA on day 1 post challenge in both vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals. It is known that Mx2 plays an important antiviral role in the response to infection by hanta virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and La Cross virus, but does not contribute to antiviral responses against influenza in cotton rats and mice 27, 29, 30. Down-regulation of Mx2 in our study might be the result of the general shut down of host gene expression observed in influenza-infected cells 31,32. In agreement with the results of Ottolini et al we also observed induction of IFN, IL6, and IL1 on day 1, coinciding with virus 5 Chapter 5126period indicates that the animals used were still juvenile 25.

Down-regulation of Mx2 in our study might be the result of the general shut down of host gene expression observed in influenza-infected cells 31,32. In agreement with the results of Ottolini et al we also observed induction of IFN, IL6, and IL1 on day 1, coinciding with virus 5 Cotton rat model for influenza vaccine evaluation127replication in the lungs 19. IFN is a hallmark of early virus infection and known to play an important role in controlling virus replication in the lungs 28. IL1 does not play a direct role in influencing influenza infected cells but it can recruit CD4+ T cells to the site of infection, while Il-6 is thought to be necessary for the resolution of influenza infections33,34. With respect to vaccination, we observed that a single injection of WIV was sufficient to induce a humoral immune response. A booster vaccination did increase the serum antibody titers significantly, yet, the increase in titers was moderate. Upon infection, the vaccinated animals showed a significantly reduced lung virus titer as compared to control animals. Moreover, all animals vaccinated with 1 or 5 \u00b5g WIV survived the challenge while half of the control animals died. Thus, immunization with WIV was successful in inducing protective immune responses in cotton rats as was earlier reported for immunization with trivalent split and adenovirus-based vaccines 12,26. Despite the fact that 0.5, 1 and 5 \u00b5g WIV induced comparable antibody titers, half of the animals from the 0.5 \u00b5g WIV group died. This likely indicates that, along with the antibodies, T cells are playing a role in protection of these animals. There is one previous publication showing evidence that memory T cells can contribute to protection 6. Other potential mechanisms include NA (Neuraminidase) inhibiting antibodies or HA and NA specific antibodies at the mucosal surfaces. Despite the overt effects of vaccination on lung virus titers several observations indicate that vaccination did not result in sterilizing immunity: (i) the breathing frequency in immunized and challenged cotton rats was only slightly lower than in challenged control animals, (ii) infection-induced cytokine production in the lungs was hardly affected, and (iii) the virus infection boosted the vaccine-induced antibody responses. Possibly, virus was still replicating in the nose of immunized and challenged cotton rats and caused enhanced breathing and cytokine induction and provided antigen for B cell stimulation. It has been shown earlier that lung virus titers are more readily controlled by vaccination than nose virus titers 12. We conclude that under the conditions used in our experiments complete protection was not achieved indicating that the vaccine dose was suboptimal. Increase of vaccine dose and/or use of a different administration route might further improve vaccination outcome. Our results confirm that cotton rats are a suitable model for influenza infection and can be useful for the evaluation of vaccine candidates. However, the model has clear limitations and to use it successfully a number of aspects have to be considered. ( i) The age of the animals is very important. During previous studies we observed that young animals (about 10 weeks) are highly susceptible to influenza virus and their weight drops rapidly upon infection. In contrast, older animals (more than 20 weeks) are rather resistant to infection (unpublished data).

In both experiments described in this paper, some non-vaccinated cotton rats were found dead by day 3 or 4, sometimes without showing severe symptoms before. The virus dose used for challenge should therefore be chosen carefully and frequent monitoring of infected animals is indicated to prevent unnecessary suffering. ( iii) The choice of virus strain is also very critical as it determines the clinical symptoms elicited and thus the read- out parameters to be used. As mentioned above, H1N1pdm infection does not affect weight and temperature of cotton rats in contrast to other strains like H5N1, H3N2, and H9N2 25.

This could be particularly the case for outbred animals which we chose intentionally as a model closer to the human situation. In conclusion, use of cotton rats for determination of vaccine efficacy with respect to amelioration of clinical symptoms requires careful fine-tuning of the model as mentioned above.

In this study, we investigated the deposition site of pulmonary delivered liquid and powder influenza vaccine formulations and its relation to their immunogenicity and protective efficacy. In vivo deposition studies in cotton rats revealed that, the powder formulation was mainly deposited in the trachea (~65%) whereas the liquid was homogenously distributed throughout the lungs (~96%). In addition, only 60% of the antigen in the powder formulation was deposited in the respiratory tract with respect to the liquid formulation. Immunogenicity studies showed that pulmonary delivered liquid and powder influenza formulations induced robust systemic and mucosal immune responses (significantly higher by liquids than by powders). When challenged with a clinical isolate of homologous H1N1pdm virus, all animals pulmonary administered with placebo had detectable virus in their lungs one day post challenge. In contrast, none of the vaccinated animals had detectable lung virus titers, except for two out of eight animals from the powder immunized group. Also, pulmonary vaccinated animals showed no or little signs of infection like increase in breathing frequency or weight loss upon challenge as compared to animals from the negative control group. In conclusion, immune responses induced by liquid formulation were significantly higher than responses induced by powder formulation, but the overall protective efficacy of both formulations was comparable. Thus, pulmonary immunization is capable of inducing protective immunity and the site of antigen deposition seems to be of minor relevance in inducing protection.

Annually, influenza leads to 3-5 million hospitalizations and around 250,000- 500,000 deaths worldwide 3. It is generally recognized that vaccination is the best strategy to prevent the disease. Currently, most influenza vaccines are administered via intramuscular injection (i.m.), which can induce systemic but very little or no mucosal immune responses4,5. Influenza virus is mainly transmitted via the airways and replicates in the respiratory epithelium, thus curbing the infection at the portal of entry would be a beneficial approach 6,7. In addition, mucosal areas such as lungs are excellent targets for influenza immunization because of their large surface area, which is loaded with a large number of antigen presenting cells5,8. Targeting lungs for influenza vaccination commenced in 1960's. It was found that liquid formulation pulmonary administered to human subjects was as effective as the traditional i.m. administered influenza vaccine in preventing illness 9 -11. Most likely due to the complicated and laborious use of nebulizers available at that time, these studies were discontinued and pulmonary targeting was not investigated for a long time 12,13. Recently, the pulmonary route has regained attention in preclinical influenza vaccine research using appropriate animal models 5,14-16. Influenza vaccines for pulmonary administration can be formulated as liquids as well as dry powders 17. Commonly, liquid formulations can be pulmonary administered to animals using the Penn-Century MicroSprayer. When enough liquid is administered using this device, whole lung deposition can be expected as liquids can drip down. For dry powder formulations, it is well known that an aerodynamic particle size of 1-5 \u00b5m is required in order to achieve antigen deposition in the whole lung 18,19. Our previous studies have shown that particles of this size distribution can be prepared by spray freeze drying (SFD) 5,12,13,20,21. However, we found that one of the most frequently used device that was available for pulmonary administration of dry powders (Penn-century insufflator) to experimental animals cannot efficiently de-agglomerate SFD powder particles 13,22. Accordingly, the particle agglomerates as dispersed by this device are relatively large and as such are expected to be deposited in the upper airways instead of the whole lung. Hence we made use of this drawback of the insufflator to achieve high deposition. In some pre-clinical studies, for vaccine candidates against tuberculosis, and also against influenza, deep lung targeting has already shown an edge over targeting upper parts of the respiratory tract 23,24. In the study by Minne et al. better immune responses were found to be elicited when liquid influenza vaccine was targeted to the deep lung instead of the upper or central airways. However, the deposition site of powder formulations and its possible effect on immune responses was not determined. Also, it 6 Pulmonary delivery of flu vaccine formulations in cotton rats139InTRoDUCTI on Influenza is one of the major respiratory diseases with high morbidity and mortality 1,2.

Influenza virus is mainly transmitted via the airways and replicates in the respiratory epithelium, thus curbing the infection at the portal of entry would be a beneficial approach 6,7. In addition, mucosal areas such as lungs are excellent targets for influenza immunization because of their large surface area, which is loaded with a large number of antigen presenting cells5,8. Targeting lungs for influenza vaccination commenced in 1960's. It was found that liquid formulation pulmonary administered to human subjects was as effective as the traditional i.m. administered influenza vaccine in preventing illness 9 -11. Most likely due to the complicated and laborious use of nebulizers available at that time, these studies were discontinued and pulmonary targeting was not investigated for a long time 12,13. Recently, the pulmonary route has regained attention in preclinical influenza vaccine research using appropriate animal models 5,14-16. Influenza vaccines for pulmonary administration can be formulated as liquids as well as dry powders 17. Commonly, liquid formulations can be pulmonary administered to animals using the Penn-Century MicroSprayer. When enough liquid is administered using this device, whole lung deposition can be expected as liquids can drip down. For dry powder formulations, it is well known that an aerodynamic particle size of 1-5 \u00b5m is required in order to achieve antigen deposition in the whole lung 18,19. Our previous studies have shown that particles of this size distribution can be prepared by spray freeze drying (SFD) 5,12,13,20,21. However, we found that one of the most frequently used device that was available for pulmonary administration of dry powders (Penn-century insufflator) to experimental animals cannot efficiently de-agglomerate SFD powder particles 13,22. Accordingly, the particle agglomerates as dispersed by this device are relatively large and as such are expected to be deposited in the upper airways instead of the whole lung. Hence we made use of this drawback of the insufflator to achieve high deposition. In some pre-clinical studies, for vaccine candidates against tuberculosis, and also against influenza, deep lung targeting has already shown an edge over targeting upper parts of the respiratory tract 23,24. In the study by Minne et al. better immune responses were found to be elicited when liquid influenza vaccine was targeted to the deep lung instead of the upper or central airways. However, the deposition site of powder formulations and its possible effect on immune responses was not determined. Also, it 6 Chapter 6140was not investigated whether or not the site of deposition in the respiratory tract is of relevance for the protective efficacy of vaccine formulations. Majority of the studies on pulmonary administration of influenza vaccines have been done in the commonly used animal model for influenza research i.e. mice. In contrast to mice which usually require the use of mouse adapted influenza virus strains for challenge 25, cotton rats are susceptible to infection by unadapted, human influenza virus strains (Eichelberger et al. 2004, Ottolini et al. 2005, Blanco et al. 2014). Disease progression in cotton rats is symptomatic and can be frequently monitored by measuring breathing frequency, weight loss and temperature drop 26-28. Furthermore, compared to mice, the larger size of cotton rats makes them less prone to potential mechanical damage during pulmonary delivery. In a previous study, we have established a cotton rat infection model for a clinical isolate of H1N1pdm virus and tested the efficacy of whole inactivated virus influenza vaccine (WIV) administered via the i.m. route (Bhide et al. unpublished data). The aim of the current study was to investigate whether a) cotton rats can be used as a model for influenza vaccination via the pulmonary route; b) difference in the site of deposition of liquid and dry influenza vaccine formulations has an impact on the immunogenicity and thus the protective efficacy of these formulations. Our results indicate that pulmonary delivery can successfully be done in cotton rats, with liquid and dry powder influenza vaccine formulations being deposited in different parts of the respiratory tract. Further, both liquid and powder influenza formulations had the potential to induce protection upon challenge with a clinically relevant virus strain. MATeRIA lS AnD Me THoDS Virus and Vaccine NIBRG-121, a vaccine strain derived from A/California/7/2009 H1N1pdm09 virus obtained from NIBSC (Potters Bay, UK), was grown on embryonated chicken eggs as described previously 20. The virus was inactivated by overnight treatment with 0.1% -propiolactone (Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium) in citrate buffer (125 mM sodium citrate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 8.2) at 4\u00b0C to produce WIV. After inactivation, WIV was dialyzed against HNE buffer (145 mM NaCl, 5 mM Hepes, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, sterilized by autoclaving) to completely remove -propiolactone. Inactivation was verified by inoculating WIV with MDCK cells and the readout was done by hemagglutination assay as described before 20. The protein concentration of the obtained WIV preparation was determined by micro-Lowry assay. The vaccine dose was based on hemagglutinin (HA) content which was assumed to be 1/3rd of the total viral protein weight as described previously 30. 6 Chapter 6140was not investigated whether or not the site of deposition in the respiratory tract is of relevance for the protective efficacy of vaccine formulations.

This virus was grown in MDCK cells and titrated in cotton rats. This virus will be termed as A/ Cal/2009 in the following sections. labeling of whole inactivated influenza virus vaccine WIV was labeled with the near infrared fluorescent dye VivoTag 680XL as per the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 3.3 mL of vaccine solution (concentration: 0.31 mg/ mL of HA) was mixed with 6.5 of VivoTag 680XL (concentration: 25 \u00b5g/\u00b5L) and 220 \u00b5L of 1 M NaHCO3 solution. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for two hours under constant shaking. Thereafter, the unbound fluorophore was removed by using Zeba Spin Desalting Columns (ThermoScientific, Rockford, USA). The degree of labeling was calculated by determining the labeled WIV and the dye concentration at 280 and 668 nm, respectively. To adjust for fluorophore crosstalk at 280 nm, 16% of the absorbance at 668 nm was subtracted from the absorbance at 280 nm. The degree of labeling was found to be approximately 2, which means that on average each WIV particle was labeled with 2 dye molecules. Preparation of the powders by spray freeze drying Labeled or unlabeled WIV was spray freeze dried together with inulin (4kDa, Sensus, Roosendaal, The Netherlands) as lyoprotectant. Inulin powders were prepared (from inulin solution in water) without influenza vaccine using the similar procedure. Briefly, labeled and unlabeled vaccine solutions were prepared in an HA:inulin weight ratio of 1:200 and 1:40, respectively. The HA:inulin weight ratios of 1:200 and 1:40 were based on a dose of 5 \u00b5g (deposition study) and 25 \u00b5g HA (immunogenicity study) in 1 mg of SFD powder. The vaccine solutions were sprayed into a vessel of liquid nitrogen using the two-fluid nozzle of the Buchi 190 Mini Spray Dryer with an inner diameter of 0.5 mm. The nozzle was placed approximately 5 cm above the level of liquid nitrogen. A liquid flow rate of 5 ml/min and an atomizing airflow of 600 Ln/h were used. Then, the frozen vaccine solutions were freeze dried for 48 h under the following conditions: during the first 24 h the shelf temperature was set at -35\u00b0C and the pressure at 0.220 mbar, after which the, temperature was gradually increased to 20\u00b0C and the pressure was lowered to 0.05 mbar during the next 24 h. The spray freeze dried vaccine formulations were collected in a chamber with a relative humidity 1% and ambient temperature. Until further use, the obtained powders were stored under airtight conditions. 6 Pulmonary delivery of flu vaccine formulations in cotton rats141For the challenge study, a clinical isolate of A/California/2009 (E9-6714) provided by the Department of Clinical Virology, UMCG, Groningen, the Netherlands was used.

Until further use, the obtained powders were stored under airtight conditions. 6 Chapter 6142Characterization of vaccine powders Particle size analysis Laser diffraction was used for determining the primary particle size distribution of spray freeze dried powders. RODOS (Sympatec, Clasuthal-Zellerfeld Germany) was used as the disperser and a pressure of 1 bar was applied for the dispersion of the powder. A 100 nm (R3) lens was used. For particle size measurements with the Penn- Century insufflator (Penn-Century, Wyndmoor, USA), the tip of the insufflator and microsprayer was kept at a constant distance from the laser beam by mounting them on an in-house mounting plate. For insufflator, an AP-1 air pump was used to deliver 1 mL of air. The geometric particle size distributions were calculated according to the Fraunhofer theory. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) A Jeol JSM 6301-F microscope was used for scanning electron microscopy. Powders were placed on a double sided sticky carbon tape on a metal disc. Then, the particles were coated with 30 nm of gold using a Balzer's 120B sputtering device (Balzer, Union, Austria). Images were taken at a magnification of 500x and 5000x. Hemagglutination assay The receptor binding activity of WIV after spray freeze drying (unlabeled WIV formulation) was assessed by the hemaglutination assay as described previously 20. Briefly, WIV was reconstituted in PBS and 50 \u00b5l was added to 96V bottom plates containing 50 \u00b5l of PBS. Two fold serial dilutions were prepared after which 50 \u00b5l of 1% guinea pig red blood cells suspension was added to each well. Hemagglutination titers were read 2 hours after incubation at room temperature and are expressed as log2 of the highest dilution where RBC agglutination could be seen. In vivo experiments All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Groningen (IACUC-RUG), The Netherlands. Outbred female cotton rats at an age of 10-12 weeks were purchased from Envigo, USA. Animals were housed as two animals per cage and were given standard diet and water. Deposition study and IVIS measurements Cotton rats were anaesthetized using isoflurane and the anesthetized animals were brought to vertical position and intubated with an Autograde catheter (14G, BD, Breda, the Netherlands). 50 \u00b5l of liquid vaccine containing 5 \u00b5g HA was delivered through the catheter to 6 cotton rats using IA-1C-R microsprayer attached to a FMJ 250 high pressure 6 Chapter 6142Characterization of vaccine powders Particle size analysis Laser diffraction was used for determining the primary particle size distribution of spray freeze dried powders.

For powder formulations, a customized length Penn-Century insufflator was used to deliver 1 mg of spray freeze dried powder containing 5 \u00b5g HA (n = 6). Three puffs of 1 mL air were used for the dispersion of the powder. The tip of the dispersion device was placed just above the carina of the animals. Immediately after vaccine administration, cotton rats were sacrificed and lungs along with trachea were taken out. Lungs either as such or dissected / into lung lobes were placed in petri dishes and evaluated by an In-Vivo Imaging System (IVIS\u00ae Spectrum, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, USA). Excitation wavelength of 675 nm was used to measure the fluorescent emission at 720 nm. The intensity of the emitted light (photons/s/cm2/ steradian) was quantified using Living Image Software v3.2. Fluorescent intensities of the vaccinated animals were corrected by subtracting the fluorescent intensities of untreated animals (n = 3). Immunization and challenge study For this experiment, animals were injected with implantable electronic ID transponders via s.c. route for identification. Weights of the cotton rats around challenge phase ranged between 120-150 grams. Cotton rats were vaccinated via the pulmonary route with influenza WIV liquid [WIV (Pul-Liq), n = 11] or 1 mg powder [WIV (Pul-Pow), n = 11] formulations with an antigen dose of 25 \u00b5g HA for both liquid and powder formulations. Cotton rats were intubated and influenza vaccine was administered similarly as described for the in vivo deposition study. As a gold standard, 100 \u00b5l of WIV containing 5 \u00b5g HA in HNE buffer was administered via the intramuscular (i.m.) injection, with 50 \u00b5l divided over both hind limbs of the animals (WIV i.m., n = 9). Animals pulmonary administered with 1 mg SFD inulin alone were used as negative control [inulin (Pul- Pow), n = 9]. Animals were vaccinated twice with an interval of three weeks between the two vaccinations. Before challenge, three animals of the pulmonary liquid group died due to unknown reasons. Three weeks after the 2nd vaccination, all cotton rats were challenged intranasally (i.n.) with 1*107 TCID50 of A/Cal/2009 virus in 100 \u00b5l dose volume distributed over both nostrils using a pipette. 100 \u00b5l dose volume was chosen in order to cover the whole respiratory tract 31. Both vaccination and challenge were carried out under 5% isoflurane/O2 anesthesia. Sample collection On the day of challenge, blood was drawn from the animals by orbital puncture and serum was separated to evaluate humoral immune responses. One day post challenge animals were sacrificed [n = 5 for WIV (Pul-Liq), n = 8 for WIV (Pul-Pow), n = 6 for WIV (i.m.), n = 6 for inulin (Pul-Pow)]. After sacrifice, nasal and lung washes were collected in 1 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing Complete\u00ae protease inhibitor cocktail 6 Pulmonary delivery of flu vaccine formulations in cotton rats143syringe (Penn-Century, Wyndmoor, USA).

One day post challenge animals were sacrificed [n = 5 for WIV (Pul-Liq), n = 8 for WIV (Pul-Pow), n = 6 for WIV (i.m.), n = 6 for inulin (Pul-Pow)]. After sacrifice, nasal and lung washes were collected in 1 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing Complete\u00ae protease inhibitor cocktail 6 Chapter 6144tablets (Roche, Almere, The Netherlands) through a hole made in the trachea, for the determination of antibody and MN titers. For virus titration, lungs were collected in a pre-weighed tube containing complete EPISERF medium (100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, all Life TechnologiesTM BV, Bleiswijk, The Netherlands). The tubes with lungs were weighed again and weight of the lung was calculated. Systemic and mucosal immune responses IgG titers were evaluated by ELISA in serum collected on the day of challenge and in the lung washes. IgA antibodies were determined in lung and nasal washes collected from the animals sacrificed one day post challenge. ELISA was performed as described previously 32. IgA and IgG titers were calculated as log10 of the reciprocal of the sample dilution corresponding to an absorbance of 0.2 at the wavelength of 492 nm. As described before, the functional potential of systemic antibodies was assessed by microneutralization (MN) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay using on the challenge day 32,33. MN titers were also determined in lung washes taken one day post challenge. MN titers are presented as log2 titers for individual cotton rats for serum MN and pooled for lung MN. For HI sera were pooled per group and also for MN lung lavages were pooled per group, as these samples were not enough to perform these assays using individual sample per animal. HI titers are presented as log2 for pooled serum per group. Limit of detection (LoD) for IgG titers was determined by calculating log10 of the 1st dilution made and the negative control samples were given a value corresponding to half of the LoD for calculation purposes. LoD for MN and HI was calculated in a similar way considering log2. Lung virus titration Lung virus titers were determined using lung homogenates collected one day post challenge as described previously 20. Briefly, lung homogenates were serially diluted 2 fold using complete EPISERF medium and inoculated with MDCK cells. After one hour the medium was replaced with EPISERF containing 5 \u00b5g/ml TPCK trypsin and incubated at 37 5% CO2. Viral titers were determined by adding 1% guinea pig RBCs to cell supernatants and scoring hemagglutination. Virus titers are depicted as log10 lung virus titers per gram of lung. Limit of detection (LoD) was determined by calculating log10 of the 1st dilution made and the negative control samples were given the value as log10 of half value of the 1st dilution. Assessment of Clinical symptoms Clinical symptoms were assessed daily for ten days after virus challenge.

The animals restrained in a pre-weighed cardboard rolls were weighed and by subtracting the weight of the roll, the weight of the animals were calculated. BF was measured using plethysmography as described previously 34. BF was defined as the number of breathes per minute. Temperature was measured using a DAS-7008/9 detector for s.c. injected electronic ID transponders, when animals were restrained (BMDS, Seaford, USA). Statistics Mann-Whitney U test (two tailed) was used to test if the differences between two groups of the cotton rats tested for different parameters were significant. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. p values less than 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001 are denoted by *, ** and *** respectively. Graphs were plotted using GraphPad Prism 5 software. ReSUlTS Characterization of liquid and powder influenza vaccine formulations The morphology of inulin, labeled and unlabeled WIV powder formulations was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Particle size of powder formulations was determined by dispersion from RODOS and dry powder insufflator. Particle size of liquid formulation was determined by dispersion from microsprayer. Furthermore, the receptor binding capacity of SFD unlabeled WIV formulation was determined by hemagglutination assay. Scanning electron Microscopy (S eM) SEM indicated that the overall shape of inulin, labeled (HA:inulin 1:200) and unlabeled (Fig. 1a, 1b and 1c). All three powder formulations i.e. inulin, labeled and unlabeled WIV particles had high porosity with an interconnected porous structure as found before for SFD powders 12,13. Unlabeled WIV particles seemed to have higher porosity than labeled WIV particles (Fig. 1b, 1c). This could be attributed to the increased HA:inulin ratio in the unlabeled WIV formulation. Particle size of labeled and unlabeled vaccine powders Laser diffraction analysis of labeled, unlabeled and inulin powders revealed that 50% of the particles had a geometric particle size < 9 \u00b5m and 90% of the particles had a size < 22 \u00b5m. (Fig. 1d) Geometric particle size was used to calculate aerodynamic particle size using the equation: dae = de (p /o ) 6 Pulmonary delivery of flu vaccine formulations in cotton rats145changes in weight, temperature and breathing frequency (BF) for ten days.

Temperature was measured using a DAS-7008/9 detector for s.c. injected electronic ID transponders, when animals were restrained (BMDS, Seaford, USA). Statistics Mann-Whitney U test (two tailed) was used to test if the differences between two groups of the cotton rats tested for different parameters were significant. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. p values less than 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001 are denoted by *, ** and *** respectively. Graphs were plotted using GraphPad Prism 5 software. ReSUlTS Characterization of liquid and powder influenza vaccine formulations The morphology of inulin, labeled and unlabeled WIV powder formulations was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Particle size of powder formulations was determined by dispersion from RODOS and dry powder insufflator. Particle size of liquid formulation was determined by dispersion from microsprayer. Furthermore, the receptor binding capacity of SFD unlabeled WIV formulation was determined by hemagglutination assay. Scanning electron Microscopy (S eM) SEM indicated that the overall shape of inulin, labeled (HA:inulin 1:200) and unlabeled (Fig. 1a, 1b and 1c). All three powder formulations i.e. inulin, labeled and unlabeled WIV particles had high porosity with an interconnected porous structure as found before for SFD powders 12,13. Unlabeled WIV particles seemed to have higher porosity than labeled WIV particles (Fig. 1b, 1c). This could be attributed to the increased HA:inulin ratio in the unlabeled WIV formulation. Particle size of labeled and unlabeled vaccine powders Laser diffraction analysis of labeled, unlabeled and inulin powders revealed that 50% of the particles had a geometric particle size < 9 \u00b5m and 90% of the particles had a size < 22 \u00b5m. (Fig. 1d) Geometric particle size was used to calculate aerodynamic particle size using the equation: dae = de (p /o ) 6 Chapter 6146where dae is the aerodynamic diameter, de is the geometric particle size, p is the density of the particles (g/cm3), o is the unit density and is the dynamic shape factor. The total solid content of the vaccine solution before spray freeze drying was 50 mg/ ml which corresponds to a density (p) of 0.05 g/cm3 of SFD powder particles, assuming no shrinkage or expansion during processing. Taking into account the geometric particle size (dae), o (unit density: 1 g/cm3) and (1 for spherical shaped particles), the aerodynamic particle size distribution was calculated. From the equation it was calculated that over 90 volume-% of the inulin, labeled and unlabeled WIV particles had aerodynamic particle size < 5\u00b5m, hence these particles were suitable for inhalation (Fig. 1e). Overall, no differences in particle size were observed by the addition of fluorescent dye or an increase in HA content and the particle size was comparable to inulin only formulation. Particle size upon dispersion from the Penn-Century Insufflator and Microsprayer The dispersing capability of the insufflator was assessed by dispersion of SFD labeled WIV, and X10, X50 and X90 values for insufflator- dispersed particles are shown in Fig. 1(f). The majority of the particles (X90) were found to be extremely large. It was found that 90% of the particles had sizes around 125 \u00b5m for all three powder formulations i.e. inulin, labeled WIV and unlabeled WIV. The dispersion of powder particles of size around 125 \u00b5m indicates that the insufflator was inefficient in de-agglomerating SFD powder particles even with 1 mL of air. However, when liquid vaccine formulations were dispersed from the microsprayer, the majority of the droplets (X90) had a geometric particle size of ~40 \u00b5m (Fig. 1f) which was about three-fold smaller than that from the insufflator (120 \u00b5m). Compared to insufflator- dispersed particles (3-140 \u00b5m), the particles dispersed by the microsprayer had a narrow size distribution (12-40 \u00b5m). Hemagglutination titers The biological activity of HA in unlabeled SFD formulation was assessed by determining its capacity to bind to the sialic acid receptors present on guinea pig RBC. The hemagglutination titers of reconstituted powder vaccine formulation were compared to those of the original untreated liquid WIV formulation. No difference in hemagglutination titers could be detected between reconstituted powder and the original liquid formulations, thus indicating that the hemagglutination activity was preserved after SFD for the unlabeled WIV formulation (Fig. 1g). In vivo deposition study 6 Chapter 6146where dae is the aerodynamic diameter, de is the geometric particle size, p is the density of the particles (g/cm3), o is the unit density and is the dynamic shape factor.

No difference in hemagglutination titers could be detected between reconstituted powder and the original liquid formulations, thus indicating that the hemagglutination activity was preserved after SFD for the unlabeled WIV formulation (Fig. 1g). In vivo deposition study 6 Pulmonary delivery of flu vaccine formulations in cotton rats147To assess the distribution of labeled liquid and powder WIV formulations in cotton rats, imaging was performed on intact as well as dissected lungs using IVIS. Upon measurement, the total fluorescence intensity in trachea as well as lung lobes of the powder group was found to be ~40% lower than in the liquid group. This implies an incomplete deposition of the powder dose in the respiratory tract with respect to liquid WIV formulation. Furthermore, IVIS images of whole lungs showed distribution of the liquid WIV formulation throughout the lungs whereas powders seemed to be deposited mainly in the trachea and central parts of lungs (Fig. 2a). Upon dissection of the lungs into trachea and individual lung lobes, bright yellow fluorescent spots could be seen in lung lobes for the liquid WIV formulation and in the trachea for the powder WIV formulation. Further, upon quantification it was found that merely 4% of the liquid WIV formulation deposited in the respiratory tract remained within the trachea (Fig. 2b), and thus that the majority of the liquid WIV formulation was distributed within the lung lobes (96%). However, for powders ~66% of the WIV formulation that was deposited in the respiratory tract was found in the trachea and only ~33% reached the central parts of the lung lobes (Fig. 2b). Thus, the amount of WIV that deposited in the lungs was about 5 times higher for the liquid than for the powder formulation. The distribution of liquid and powder WIV formulations was further assessed by calculating relative dose percentages in trachea and individual lung lobes of the cotton rats. A relative dose percentage of 100 would imply that the dose percentage deposited in that lung lobe or trachea is equal to its weight percentage in relation to the total lung weight. Liquid WIV formulations showed a relative dose of ~13% in the trachea which further supports our conclusion of negligible deposition in the trachea (Fig. 2c). Moreover, a relative dose of ~200% was found in the left lung lobe, right superior and accessory lung lobe which would imply twice the deposition of dose in these (right superior and accessory) lung lobes compared to the right middle and right inferior lung lobe (Fig. 2c). The higher dose deposition in the left, right superior and accessory lung lobes is in line with the bright yellow fluorescent spots observed in these lobes after excision of the whole lung (Fig. 2a). However, for powders the trachea had a four-fold higher relative dose than the dose deposited in the lung lobes; a comparable but low relative dose percentage was found in all lung lobes (Fig. 2c). This is further in agreement with dark yellow spots in the trachea and comparable dark red patches visible in the central parts of lung lobes of animals vaccinated with powder formulation. Systemic immune responses To assess the systemic immune responses induced by liquid and powder WIV formulations upon pulmonary delivery, IgG ELISA, MN and HI were performed using serum samples collected three weeks after the second vaccination. All cotton rats were 6 Pulmonary delivery of flu vaccine formulations in cotton rats147To assess the distribution of labeled liquid and powder WIV formulations in cotton rats, imaging was performed on intact as well as dissected lungs using IVIS.

This is further in agreement with dark yellow spots in the trachea and comparable dark red patches visible in the central parts of lung lobes of animals vaccinated with powder formulation. Systemic immune responses To assess the systemic immune responses induced by liquid and powder WIV formulations upon pulmonary delivery, IgG ELISA, MN and HI were performed using serum samples collected three weeks after the second vaccination. All cotton rats were 6 Chapter 6148tested seronegative for influenza specific antibodies before the start of the experiment (data not shown). After two vaccinations, animals from the inulin (Pul-Pow) group did not have any detectable serum IgG titers. Further, the IgG titers induced by pulmonary administered WIV were comparable to the titers induced by i.m. administered (Fig. 3a). Although IgG the IgG titers induced by WIV (Pul-Liq), the difference was not significant. The functional assays, i.e. MN (Fig. 3b) and HI (Fig. 3c) assay, showed that the antibodies generated by all three vaccine formulations had the potential to neutralize virus and inhibit virus hemagglutination in an in-vitro setting. WIV (Pul-Liq) induced significantly (Pul-Liq) were higher than WIV (Pul-Pow). Thus, pulmonary delivered liquid WIV was found to be slightly more potent in inducing functional systemic immune responses than the pulmonary delivered powder WIV formulation. Mucosal immune responses To assess the mucosal immune responses induced by pulmonary delivered liquid and powder influenza vaccine formulations, IgA titers were determined using nasal and lung washes taken from animals sacrificed one day post challenge. Along with IgA, IgG and MN titers were also determined from lung washes. Animals administered with inulin (Pul-Pow) were negative for mucosal antibodies. WIV (Pul-Liq) induced nasal and lung IgA in all animals and IgA titers were significantly higher in this group than WIV (Pul-Pow) (Fig. 4a and 4b, respectively). Some cotton rats of the WIV (Pul-Pow) group were found to be non-responders for nasal (3/8) and lung IgA (4/8), while some of the animals vaccinated via i.m. route were found to have IgA in their nose (3/6) and lungs (4/6). However, the titers generated by WIV (i.m.) were found to be significantly lower than the titers generated by WIV (Pul-Liq) group in which all animals were responders. After pulmonary immunization, the detection of nasal antibodies can possibly be attributed to the migration of antigen specific B cells from the site of induction (lungs) to distant mucosal site (nose) 35,36. Further, WIV and WIV (Pul-Liq) induced 4c). Lung IgG titers by WIV (Pul-Pow) titers induced by WIV (Pul-Liq). Moreover, mucosal antibodies in the lung washes were found to neutralize the virus in vitro (Fig. 4d) and the trend for these MN titers (higher for liquids than for powders) was similar to the trend observed in ELISA titers (Fig. 4b and 4c). Thus, pulmonary delivered liquid WIV was found to be more immunogenic in inducing mucosal immune responses than the pulmonary delivered powder WIV formulation. 6 Chapter 6148tested seronegative for influenza specific antibodies before the start of the experiment (data not shown).

Moreover, mucosal antibodies in the lung washes were found to neutralize the virus in vitro (Fig. 4d) and the trend for these MN titers (higher for liquids than for powders) was similar to the trend observed in ELISA titers (Fig. 4b and 4c). Thus, pulmonary delivered liquid WIV was found to be more immunogenic in inducing mucosal immune responses than the pulmonary delivered powder WIV formulation. 6 Pulmonary delivery of flu vaccine formulations in cotton rats149lung viral load To assess if the pulmonary delivered influenza vaccine formulations could reduce the viral load in the lungs after challenge, virus titration was done using the lungs of animals sacrificed on day one post challenge (Fig. 5). It has been shown before that lung virus replication peaks one day after challenge in cotton rats 27, 37. In line with that, we could also detect virus in the lungs of animals administered with inulin (Pul-Pow) one day post-challenge (with mean titer of about 103.3), indicating successful infection. No detectable virus titers were found in the lungs of the cotton rats vaccinated with WIV (i.m.) and WIV (Pul-Liq). Also, six out of eight animals immunized with WIV (Pul-Pow) did not have any detectable virus in their lungs. However, in two WIV (Pul-Pow) immunized animals, virus could be detected in the lungs. Interestingly, these two animals were the ones with no nasal and lung IgA antibodies and one of the two also had low serum IgG titers. Overall, the majority of the animals vaccinated with WIV via the pulmonary route did not have detectable virus in their lungs. Clinical symptoms To assess the protection conferred by pulmonary delivered WIV formulations, animals were followed for ten days after challenge to evaluate the following clinical symptoms, i.e. weight loss, increase in BF, and drop in body temperature. Animals administered with inulin (Pul-Pow) showed a trend towards decrease in body weight after challenge, although it was not substantial (Fig. 6a). No or little weight loss was observed for animals vaccinated with WIV (i.m.) (Fig. (Fig. 6d). Overall, live virus challenge did not have much influence on weight in any of the animals. Animals administered with inulin (Pul-Pow) showed an increase in BF after challenge for two days (Fig. 6e) after which the BF gradually decreased. Animals vaccinated with WIV (i.m.) (Fig. (Fig. 6h) showed no or very little increase in the BF over the period of 10 days. Days-wise BF was plotted for animals from all the groups for day 1 (Fig. 6i) and day 2 (Fig. 6j). A difference of ~30 breathes/ minute for day one and ~60 breathes/minute for day two was observed between the animals from the inulin and the pulmonary WIV groups. Hence, pulmonary administered WIV formulations protected cottons rats from infection induced increase in breathing. There was no effect of challenge on the temperature in non-vaccinated as well as vaccinated animals (supplementary fig. 1) 6 Pulmonary delivery of flu vaccine formulations in cotton rats149lung viral load To assess if the pulmonary delivered influenza vaccine formulations could reduce the viral load in the lungs after challenge, virus titration was done using the lungs of animals sacrificed on day one post challenge (Fig. 5).

A difference of ~30 breathes/ minute for day one and ~60 breathes/minute for day two was observed between the animals from the inulin and the pulmonary WIV groups. Hence, pulmonary administered WIV formulations protected cottons rats from infection induced increase in breathing. There was no effect of challenge on the temperature in non-vaccinated as well as vaccinated animals (supplementary fig. 1) 6 Chapter 6150DISCUSSI on In the current study, we showed that cotton rats can be successfully vaccinated against influenza via the pulmonary route. Further, it was demonstrated that pulmonary administered liquid WIV was predominantly deposited throughout the lungs while powder WIV was deposited mainly in the trachea, indicating clear differences in sites of deposition. Interestingly, a vaccination-challenge study revealed differences in particularly mucosal immune responses, but had only minor impact on protection upon live virus challenge. Liquid and powder formulations were deposited in different parts of the respiratory tract, but both these formulations induced potent systemic immune responses. Besides systemic immune responses, an important aspect of mucosal vaccination is the induction of IgA antibody at mucosal sites 38,39. Even though in some previous studies with influenza vaccines, cotton rats were vaccinated via the i.n. route, mucosal immunity was not evaluated 40,41. Here for the first time we show that, upon pulmonary influenza vaccination, mucosal antibody (IgA and IgG) responses along with systemic immune responses can be achieved in this animal model. Overall, WIV (Pul-Liq) induced better immune responses than WIV (Pul-Pow) in particular in the respiratory tract. Although differences in immune responses were obvious between animals vaccinated with liquid and powder formulations, protection with respect to prevention of clinical symptoms conferred by both these formulations was rather similar. Previous studies in mice have shown that mucosal antibodies (IgA and IgG) contribute to virus neutralization in vivo 42. In line with this, we also observed that mucosal antibodies induced upon pulmonary vaccination could neutralize the challenge virus in vitro , possibly indicating their role in the clearance of the virus at the portal of entry. The two animals having lung virus titers from the WIV (Pul-Pow) group had no lung and nasal IgA. Also, one of these two animals had no lung IgG while the other had low lung IgG titers. The remaining two non-responders for lung IgA from the WIV (Pul-Pow) group cleared virus from the lungs, which could be attributed to the presence of IgG antibodies in their lungs. This further supports the role of mucosal antibodies (IgA and IgG) in virus neutralization. Of the clinical symptoms assessed in the vaccinated and challenged animals, BF was earlier found to be the most sensitive parameter of infection (Bhide et al. unpublished data). It is known that virus replication in the respiratory tract leads to epithelial damage, which in turn causes difficulties in breathing in cotton rats 43. Most likely this causes an increase in BF of infected animals. However, cotton rats pulmonary administered with WIV (liquid or powder) showed little or no increase in BF compared to those pulmonary administered with inulin indicating that protection from virus replication in the lungs results in normal breathing. Further, we found little effect of H1N1pdm challenge on 6 Chapter 6150DISCUSSI on In the current study, we showed that cotton rats can be successfully vaccinated against influenza via the pulmonary route. Further, it was demonstrated that pulmonary administered liquid WIV was predominantly deposited throughout the lungs while powder WIV was deposited mainly in the trachea, indicating clear differences in sites of deposition.

Most likely this causes an increase in BF of infected animals. However, cotton rats pulmonary administered with WIV (liquid or powder) showed little or no increase in BF compared to those pulmonary administered with inulin indicating that protection from virus replication in the lungs results in normal breathing. Further, we found little effect of H1N1pdm challenge on 6 Pulmonary delivery of flu vaccine formulations in cotton rats151weight and no effect on the temperature of cotton rats administered with inulin (Pul- Pow). This is also consistent with what has been observed previously; infection with H1N1pdm influenza virus, in contrast to infection with other influenza virus strains, does not affect the weight and temperature of cotton rats 28 (Bhide et al. unpublished data). Overall, no differences were observed in the protective efficacy (lung virus titers and BF) of WIV (Pul-Liq) and WIV (Pul-Pow) formulations; though a difference in deposition site was obvious. In this study, the tip of the insufflator was placed at the bifurcation of trachea i.e. carina, thus whole lung deposition might be expected. However, the introduction of 1 ml of air to an already inflated lung caused a return flow of air containing powder particles. This return flow further most likely caused the majority of the particles to be deposited in the trachea. Moreover, it was visually observed that a fraction of the particles were even exhaled resulting in incomplete dosing. In addition, it was noticed that a portion of the powder remained in the insufflator after three puffs further reducing the delivered dose. The incomplete dosing of the powder formulation was further evident from the detection of reduced fluorescence intensity in the respiratory tract of cotton rats compared to the fluorescence intensity in liquid vaccinated group. Furthermore, as also reported by Murugappan et al., the insufflator was not able to break up agglomerates of the SFD powder into primary particles as 90 vol% of the dispersed particles had a geometric particle size of ~130 \u00b5m 13. This particle size corresponds to an aerodynamic diameter of 29 \u00b5m, which by far exceeds the required size range of 1-5 \u00b5m for whole lung deposition. Thus, pulmonary delivery of SFD powder particles to cotton rats using the insufflator results in incomplete dosing and very limited whole lung deposition. Therefore, we utilized this inefficient de-agglomeration property of the insufflator to achieve powder deposition in trachea. Hence, we would like to emphasize this fact that, the powder deposition in trachea was due to the limitations of the pre-clinical device available for administration rather than the characteristics or the quality of formulation itself. By contrast, no air is used during administration of the liquid vaccine formulation with the microsprayer. Therefore, for the liquid formulation, no substantial return flow of air is expected. Furthermore, no substantial amount of liquid remained in the microsprayer. Thus, dosing was complete or nearly complete. The microsprayer produced droplets with a geometric size of 12-40 \u00b5m. As the density of the droplets was around 1 g/cm3, the aerodynamic diameter was similar to the geometric size, and thus also too large for whole lung deposition. Apparently, a volume of 50 \u00b5l was sufficient for a 'dripping down effect' to reach the alveolar regions of the lung. Thus, complete dosing of the liquid vaccine led to the induction of better immune responses 6 Pulmonary delivery of flu vaccine formulations in cotton rats151weight and no effect on the temperature of cotton rats administered with inulin (Pul- Pow). This is also consistent with what has been observed previously; infection with H1N1pdm influenza virus, in contrast to infection with other influenza virus strains, does not affect the weight and temperature of cotton rats 28 (Bhide et al. unpublished data).

Furthermore, no substantial amount of liquid remained in the microsprayer. Thus, dosing was complete or nearly complete. The microsprayer produced droplets with a geometric size of 12-40 \u00b5m. As the density of the droplets was around 1 g/cm3, the aerodynamic diameter was similar to the geometric size, and thus also too large for whole lung deposition. Apparently, a volume of 50 \u00b5l was sufficient for a 'dripping down effect' to reach the alveolar regions of the lung. Thus, complete dosing of the liquid vaccine led to the induction of better immune responses 6 Chapter 6152than powder vaccine which had the incomplete dosing problems due to the inefficient insufflator and return flow due to the breathing of the animals. In order to target different parts of the respiratory tract, Minne et al. administered liquid formulations with different dose volumes and also positioned mice at different angles during administration. They reported deep lung deposition of influenza vaccine to be superior to deposition in the upper or central airways 24 It was speculated that an improved residence time of influenza antigen when targeted deep into the lungs (due to reduced mucociliary clearance) promotes a better immune response. However, our study shows that even though deposited in the trachea, WIV powder formulation had comparable protective efficacy as WIV liquid formulation deposited deep in the lungs. This could be due to the use of inulin in the WIV powder formulation; inulin might enhance the viscosity at the site of dissolution and thus the problem of mucociliary clearance might be countered. This might in turn increase the residence time and thereby uptake of WIV antigen by antigen presenting cells (APCs) which are abundantly present both in the trachea and in the lungs of rodents 44,45. Also, human trachea and lungs both contain a large number of dendritic cells that can take up antigens and transport them to the draining lymph nodes. 46-49. Thus, both these sites, trachea as well as lungs, could be favorable for influenza vaccine uptake to elicit a potent systemic and local immune response. Hence, the observed differences in immune responses could be predominately due to the incomplete dosing of the WIV powder as APCs are present in both trachea as well as lungs. The current study demonstrates that the immune responses generated by influenza vaccine formulations deposited either in the trachea or deep lung can be potent enough to provide protection against live virus challenge. Since the site of deposition seems less important for the success of pulmonary influenza vaccination, we believe that a dry powder influenza vaccine formulation is preferable to a liquid formulation because of the following reasons; i) availability of better clinical devices for dispersion of powders: Though in this study we showed that the deposition of WIV (Pul-Pow) was predominantly in the trachea of cotton rats, deposition over the whole lungs might still be beneficial. Better lung deposition is expected in a clinical setting because better powder delivery devices for humans are available (Twincer, Torus). These devices work on the principle of active inhalation by the individual thereby preventing exhalation of the powder by return flow 17 ,50,51. Moreover, in a clinical setting the use of a dry powder inhaler with low retention can further resolve dosing issues associated with Penn- insufflator; ii) long term stability: Previous studies have shown that by using appropriate formulation strategies, dry powder influenza vaccine formulations can be prepared with long term stability at room temperature 12,13,52-54. This alleviates the need of cold chain for powder influenza vaccines thus making it suitable for stockpiling, which is of 6 Chapter 6152than powder vaccine which had the incomplete dosing problems due to the inefficient insufflator and return flow due to the breathing of the animals.

Vaccination is the cornerstone for influenza control. Annually people are vaccinated with influenza vaccines made to protect against circulating strains of that particular season3. There are many shortcomings of current seasonal influenza vaccines as discussed in detail in the introduction section of this thesis. The major problem is that the seasonal vaccines confer only strain-specific immunity by eliciting neutralizing antibodies against hemagglutinin (HA) of the vaccine strain4,5. Accordingly, these seasonal vaccines fail to protect against antigenically drifted and shifted influenza virus strains which can be of pandemic potential3. Since 1900, mankind has faced 4 major pandemics which led to havoc due to lack of broadly protective influenza vaccines6-9. There is an urgent need for a universal or broadly protective influenza vaccine4,10. Preclinical vaccine evaluation of influenza vaccines is mainly done in mice or ferrets, both of which have their advantages and disadvantages. Hence influenza vaccine needs to be done in another small animal model. Much research effort is put into the field of influenza vaccine development to make better vaccines overcoming the shortcomings of the current vaccines. There are many new vaccine candidates in the pipeline which are in various stages of development. Despite all the efforts, we still don't have an \"ideal\" influenza vaccine which would be 1) more immunogenic, universal/ broadly protective 2) stable, in different physiological conditions so that the immunogenicity and in turn the efficacy is not affected 3) safe to administer with low or no side effects. An ideal vaccine would also provide long term protection. Where are we going wrong? What needs to be improved in the ongoing research? Work put together in this thesis describes use of different vaccination strategies, delivery systems and immune mechanisms to achieve broad protection. It also describes suitability of cotton rats as a model for influenza vaccine evaluation and also suitability of this model for pulmonary vaccine delivery. Vaccination strategies and delivery systems A universal influenza vaccine is like the 'holy grail' for influenza vaccine research. Many different vaccination strategies are being tried and tested to improve cross-protection. In chapter 2 , we combined WIV with four different adjuvants and clearly saw that the cross-reactive immune responses induced by adjuvanted WIV were significantly higher compared to non-adjuvanted WIV. Also, WIV conferred better cross- protection compared to non-adjuvanted WIV. It is known that sequential infection with influenza viruses can lead to cross-protection11,12. However, less is known about whether sequential vaccination with different influenza vaccines can lead to cross-protection. 7 Chapter 6166bACKGR oUnD Influenza is one of the major respiratory diseases with a very high disease burden1,2.

However, less is known about whether sequential vaccination with different influenza vaccines can lead to cross-protection. 7 Thesis discussion and perspectives167One approach being employed is sequential vaccination with antigenically different strains to achieve cross-protection13-15. In chapter 3 , we describe that sequential vaccination with antigenically distinct influenza vaccines is a promising method of achieving cross-protection in mice. Another approach is use of virosomes as delivery vehicle for vaccine antigens as described in chapter 4 . We combined virosomes with conserved NP of influenza and the adjuvant MPLA to improve activation of APCs and cross-presentation to achieve cross-reactive CD8 T cell immune responses for broad- protection upon live virus challenge. Targeting conserved proteins of influenza (HA stalk, NP , M1, M2e) is a promising approach to achieve broad-protection as these proteins can lead to cross-reactive antibodies and cytotoxic T cell responses which can in turn induce cross-protection16-19. Mechanisms of cross-protection and harnessing pre-existing immunity It has been shown that both cross-reactive T cells and B cells are involved in cross- protection. In chapter 2 and chapter 3 , we therefore investigated which immune mechanisms were critical for protection. We found that upon intranasal vaccination with (low dose) WIV combined with mucosal adjuvants, serum antibodies and CD4 T cells were crucial for optimal protection against heterosubtypic virus challenge. In contrast, upon sequential i.m. vaccination with (high dose) WIV, serum antibodies and memory CD8 T cells were involved in cross-protection. In both studies, we found that serum antibodies although not able to cross-neutralize the virus as measured by a classic neutralization assay, still protected na\u00efve animals upon adoptive transfer. This indicates the role of non-neutralizing antibodies which can work via mechanisms such as ADCC or ADCP . It has been shown that ADCC involves cells such as NK cells, monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils that bear the FcRIIIa receptor and engage Fc receptors of the antibodies usually IgG1 and IgG3 in humans. This cross-linking of FcRIIIa receptor leads to release of granzymes and perforins which in turn leads to DNA fragmentation and apoptosis of the target cells20. HA stem specific antibodies employ ADCC function for the induction of cross-protection. In clinical studies, subjects with high ADCC titers before challenge, showed less viral load and reduced clinical symptoms. However more of such studies are needed as only three subjects had high ADCC titers21. Additionally M2e based vaccines have also been shown to induce ADCC dependent cross-protection. Passive transfer of anti-M2e antibodies in humans was correlated with reduced clinical symptoms upon infection22. We hypothesize that in chapter 2 and chapter 3 , non-neutralizing antibodies mediated cross-protection via ADCC but further experiments are needed to confirm this hypothesis. Memory T cells play a vital role in cross-protection against different influenza subtypes23-26. Systemic immunization leads to generation of T effector cells, which 7 Thesis discussion and perspectives167One approach being employed is sequential vaccination with antigenically different strains to achieve cross-protection13-15.

Memory T cells play a vital role in cross-protection against different influenza subtypes23-26. Systemic immunization leads to generation of T effector cells, which 7 Chapter 6168is also shown in chapter 3 upon sequential vaccination with antigenically distinct WIV. Budimir et al showed that subcutaneous (systemic) vaccination with WIV led to induction of CTL's which were crucial for protection27. Furthermore, it has been shown before that tissue resident memory CD8 T cells are essential for cross-protection24,25. Using fluorescent microscopy, it was demonstrated that CD103+ CD8+ T cells remain attached to the walls of the large airways long after pulmonary immunization but are absent from systemically primed mice. Zens et al have also shown that upon intranasal immunization with LAIV, lung CD4+ TRM and virus-specific CD8+ TRM were generated and they conferred long term cross-protection23. Vaccination in the upper respiratory tract of mice leads to the generation of TRMs in nasal epithelia and they can prevent the transmission of the virus to the lungs28. Translating this to the humans and memory T cells, Purwar et al showed that a normal human lung contains abundant TRMs and they can respond to the recall antigen previously encountered via the lung mucosa29. It would be important to target these cells through mucosal vaccination to achieve broader protection. In chapter 2 , where we found that mucosally administered vaccine was superior to parenterally administered vaccine, the reason could be TRMs. We could not detect these cells in lungs due to technical problems and further studies are required to exploit this area more. Pre-existing B and T cell immunity against influenza can influence vaccine efficacy. Most human beings have pre-existing immunity to influenza and it can really be decisive in shaping the immune system upon vaccination or subsequent infections. Pre-exposure to influenza can determine the specificity and magnitude of antibody responses to a subsequent exposure to a new strain30. A lot of vaccine strategies are being designed to elicit broadly reactive memory B cells to induce cross-protection31. It has been shown before that pre-existing T cell immunity can provide protection even in absence of antibodies32. There are other studies which have shown that pre-existing T cells correlated with the reduced severity of the disease and also reduced spread of virus shed from the upper respiratory tract33-35. It is quite crucial to understand how the performance of current vaccine candidates is influenced by pre-existing immunity to make better vaccines. Harnessing the pre-existing immunity in different populations might be a way to reach the goal of a universal or broadly protective influenza vaccine. Use of suitable animal models for pre-clinical vaccine efficacy studies Preclinical influenza research is mainly done in ferrets and mice36,37. C57/BL6 and BALB/c mice are used widely for pre-clinical studies with influenza and also other infectious diseases. However, these two mouse models show differences in the susceptibility and immune responses against the invading pathogen38. C57/BL6 mice show more Th1 skewed activity and Th1 cytokine responses, while BALB/c mice show Th2 skewed 7 Chapter 6168is also shown in chapter 3 upon sequential vaccination with antigenically distinct WIV.

In chapter 2 and 3 we used CB6F1 mice which are F1 off-springs of a cross between C57/BL6 and BALB/c mice. Groves et al describe that they developed CB6F1 as infection model for a number of influenza viruses by characterizing disease progression, inflammation, cell influx and viral load. They could see clinical symptoms upon H1N1 and influenza B infection, however symptoms were less prominent with current seasonal H3N2 strain even upon challenge with high virus doses41. Anderson et al also have shown that DNA vaccination in CB6F1 mice could enhance humoral as well as cellular immune responses in these animals42. From the previous studies and studies described in chapter 2 and 3 , CB6F1 is a robust mouse model for assessing both humoral as well as cellular immune responses in influenza vaccination-challenge studies. In chapter 5 we describe the suitability of a cotton rat model for influenza vaccine evaluation. Cotton rats have been used for influenza infection and vaccination research43-46. However, there was information missing in the literature about clinical disease progression of influenza in vaccinated cotton rats, which we tried to address. This animal model has both pros and cons as a model. Cotton rats can be infected with clinical isolates of influenza virus; however infection conditions need to be fine- tuned depending on strain of influenza virus, age of the animals, inbred/ outbred nature of the animals etc. All animals may not behave in similar way upon infection. We observed rather a high level of variation among animals especially with respect to clinical symptoms upon infection with clinical isolate of H1N1pdm virus. Also, handling these animals can be time-consuming and laborious at times, due to their inherent aggressive behavior. Nevertheless, for specific research question the use of cotton rats can be advantageous. In chapter 6 we investigated pulmonary delivery of liquid and powder influenza vaccines in the cotton rat model. Since pulmonary immunization in animals requires intubation, due to their bigger size cotton rats are more suitable than mice and less prone to experience mechanical damage during the intubation process. We observed that liquid and powder WIV formulations could induce protective immunity in cotton rats upon pulmonary vaccination and we are the first to report about successful pulmonary vaccine administration in cotton rat model. Hence, cotton rats can be used as a model for influenza however only for certain aspects. Mucosal vaccination and mucosal adjuvants Mucosal immunization is gaining a lot of attention as it can induce local as well as systemic immunity47-49. Furthermore, mucosal vaccination can induce long lasting B and T cell memory50. IgA has been shown to be more cross reactive than IgG antibodies against influenza51. Other advantages of mucosal vaccination are that the vaccines are easy to administer, especially in people having needle phobia, and there is a low risk of 7 Thesis discussion and perspectives169immune profile39,40. In chapter 2 and 3 we used CB6F1 mice which are F1 off-springs of a cross between C57/BL6 and BALB/c mice. Groves et al describe that they developed CB6F1 as infection model for a number of influenza viruses by characterizing disease progression, inflammation, cell influx and viral load. They could see clinical symptoms upon H1N1 and influenza B infection, however symptoms were less prominent with current seasonal H3N2 strain even upon challenge with high virus doses41.

Other advantages of mucosal vaccination are that the vaccines are easy to administer, especially in people having needle phobia, and there is a low risk of 7 Chapter 6170cross-contamination47, 52. However to date mucosal vaccination has only been successful with live attenuated vaccines while inactivated vaccines have been suboptimal53,54. Live attenuated vaccines pose a problem of safety, while inactivated vaccines are associated with low immunogenicity and hence a lot of research is now going on in mucosal adjuvants47. Safe and effective adjuvants are needed for the development of mucosal vaccines. In chapter 2 , we describe that WIV combined with the mucosal adjuvants CAF09, CTA1-DD or CTA1-3M2e-DD given via the cross-protection compared to non-adjuvanted or CAF01 WIV given via the i.m. route. Although, mucosally adjuvanted vaccines induced high levels of local IgA, interestingly this antibody class was not crucial in inducing cross-protection as observed in a study conducted in IgA KO mice. Certain parenteral vaccine adjuvants also work as mucosal adjuvants and many are being tested in vivo in animal models55. Bacterial toxins such as Escherichia coli heat labile enterotoxin (LT), cholera toxin (CT), and their derivatives were also used as mucosal adjuvants. But, LT was associated with diarrhea in adults and CT adjuvanted influenza vaccine was linked to Bell's palsy in humans56,57. However with more research, CTA1DD, a safer nontoxic cholera toxin based protein adjuvant was formulated and has shown a great promise in pre-clinical studies58-62. A number of toll like receptor agonists such as Muramyldipeptide, Poly:IC, MPL, flagellin, and CpG have been shown to work as mucosal adjuvants 47,63- 65. Apart from these other mucosal adjuvants could be nonmicrobial-derived products, including liposomes, oil emulsions, and several kinds of nanoparticles55. Taken together adjuvants studied in chapter 2 and other mucosal adjuvants mentioned show promising results and need to be investigated further. Pulmonary immunization is as an attractive alternative to intranasal immunization due the large surface area of the lungs which contains a large number of antigen presenting cells66,67. In chapter 6 , we assessed whether the site of deposition for pulmonary administered liquid or powder influenza vaccines can affect their immunogenicity and protective efficacy using the cotton rat model. We found that liquid formulations deposited mainly in the lungs, while powder formulations deposited almost exclusively in the trachea. After two pulmonary vaccinations, liquid vaccines induced significantly higher immune responses, especially mucosal immune responses, than powder formulations. However, upon live virus challenge, protection conferred by both liquid and powder vaccines in terms of reduction in breathing frequency and lung viral load were similar. Hence, the site of deposition was of minor importance for the overall protection conferred by these two vaccine formulations. Powder vaccine formulations would be preferred over liquids as they are much more stable, less prone to degradation by varying temperatures and are easy to stockpile in situations like pandemics. Also, in humans, delivery of powder to the lungs would not 7 Chapter 6170cross-contamination47, 52.

Con ClUDI nG ReMARKS There is a need of an influenza vaccine which is immunogenic, stable and can induce broadly protective immunity. There are many factors as discussed above that add to the complexity of formulating the ideal influenza vaccines. Apart from them, host factors can largely affect vaccine efficacy. Studies need to be carried out in which physiological factors like age, sex, obesity, and immune-compromised status should be taken into consideration when formulating and testing new influenza vaccine candidates. With work described in this thesis we tried to address some of the problems using several approaches. However, there is still a lot of research needed in order to reach the goal of making better influenza vaccines. There are several universal vaccine candidates and vaccination strategies being tested or used by the vaccine manufacturers or research institutions independent of one another. Thus, relative effectiveness of these candidate vaccines or approaches compared to the other approaches remains elusive. Comparative approaches especially head-to-head comparison studies are much more favorable. Collaboration among researchers within and across countries would facilitate such a platform for the evaluation of their candidates under similar condition. Such collaborative studies will be much more effective and speed up the process of vaccine evaluation. 7 Thesis discussion and perspectives171be a problem as suitable devices (Twincer, Torus) are available and are already used successfully 68,69.

As it is very well quoted by Albert Schweitzer, \"At times our own light goes out and is rekindled by a spark from another person. Each of us has cause to think with deep gratitude of those who have lighted the flame within us.\" First and foremost my promotor Prof. Dr. Anke Huckriede, Anke, you were it all that I could have asked for in my PhD adviser. I had always heard that if your PhD supervisor is a nice person, half of your PhD battle is already won. I can't agree with it more. You are one of the nicest human beings I know, a very supportive and caring person and an excellent mentor. Anke always wants her students to develop in many aspects of life and not only in science. My love for teaching has always been nurtured by seeing the way you are with your students. There is so much to learn from you, mainly your patience and enthusiasm about striving for knowledge. I thoroughly enjoyed your company outside lab during conferences and meetings as well. I feel thank you is a very small to express my gratefulness for you Anke. My second promotor Prof. Dr. H.W. Frijlink, Erik, he is epitome of liveliness. In spite of being such a busy person, he is always smiling and talking with everyone with such zeal and enthusiasm. He always gave helpful insights whenever we discussed my project or had assessment meetings. Thank you very much Erik for all your help and support! Dr. Wouter Hinrichs, my co- promotor and such a jolly person. Truly an expert in formulations and a very helpful person. Your advice has always helped me in improving my research.

Thank you very much Jan for letting me stay in Star Numanstraat 5B. I spent a considerable amount of time during my PhD there and it will always be very special to me. Dear Iza, I have always been impressed by your constructive criticism and helpful nature. It has always taught me to be critical. I would like to express my gratitude to Joalnda O for always helping me sorting out the official stuff. It's so wonderful to see how amazingly you organize everything with perfection and precision. I have tried to learn a lot of it from you. After joining Virology and Immunology research group, one person always had my back and was Jacqueline. She is such a delightful person to work with. You were much more than just a colleague to me, a friend, a philosopher, a guide (mom at times ;)). Your incredible calmness and composure during stress times is something I always admire and wish to have some of that someday ;). Thank you for all your support, fun times during the crazy animal experiments and the Indian food that you tried to make for me at your place: D. I had such a fabulous time with you and will continue to have some more. I am very much honored and indebted as you said yes for being my paranymph. Dear Marijke, you were so encouraging and helpful during last 4.5 years. You always have answers to all the problems in the lab and the most reliable person to go to for anything. It was very sweet of you to drive me to Jacqueline's place to visit her when she had her leg fractured and also to invite me and Wei for dinner at your house. You and Hari made very delicious food then and I really enjoyed it. Talking about the crazy animal experiments, someone else has witnessed it very closely as well and is Dong Wei. It was soooo much fun working together. He taught me so much about working with animals and made me confident in doing so. I hope to see you soon for your defense! I would like to thank Denise, Annemarie, Baukje Nynke and Heidi for their help in the lab. Along with Science, I enjoyed all the fun outings with the PhD students and post- docs Stephanie, Julia, Mariana, Jos\u00e9, Tabitha, Gabriela, Aurora, Nilima, Ellen, Federica, Elias and Ces\u00e1r. I had a great time and fun in office 0661, thanks to all my awesome office-mates starting from Zoraida, George to Mayra, Dong Wei, John, Beto and Amrita. It's always amazing to have office-mates who are also big foodies like you! Let's always store more and more food and keep eating, Beto and Amrita! :D My laborious animal experiments were successful because of perfection of Tjarko Meijerhof. He made it so easy for me and trained me well. Thank you very much for all your help Tjarko. Along with him I would like to thank Michel, Annemieke, Bianca, Ar, Natascha and all CDP officers and caretakers for help with the animal experiments. Geert Mesander and Wayel Abdullah, thank you for your help with LSRII.

Geert Mesander and Wayel Abdullah, thank you for your help with LSRII. My project would not have been completed if we did not have such an excellent team of scientists Appendices184in UNISEC. I am extremely grateful to Nils Lycke, Dennis Christensen, Othmar Engelhardt, Stephen Norley and their respective research teams for all help during last 4 years. I would like to thank UNISEC for funding this research judiciously; else such expensive animal experiments wouldn't have been possible to perform. I would like to thank my students Dani\u00e9lle and Rick who helped me with my research and also nurtured my teaching abilities. I would also like to thank other Bachelor and Master students who did their thesis or colloquium or short research project with me. I learnt something or the other from all of you. Thank you Philip for all your help, it was always a fun collaboration especially during UNISEC meetings and conferences. Thank you Iliana Boshoven-Gkini for the beautiful cover design, Jeroen Reith with the whole layout and Robert kanters (Ridderprint) for the help with printing my thesis. Coming far away from home, I did not expect to find so many Indian friends who became like a family! I would like to thank Jasmine and Tushar for their friendship and support. We had such amazing time especially during our trip to Italy! Thank you Milind for your backing and giving me the honour of being your paranymph. Also thanks to fun. Special thanks to Sreejita and Laura, my 1st ever housemates at Star Numanstraat 5B!! We had such nice (food) gatherings and I leant so much from you girls. Thank you Sreejita for saying yes to be my paranymph. I feel so grateful. Dear Dipayan and Swati, we became such good friends in the last 6 months of my PhD, thank you for your inputs in my thesis. Lets keep continue enjoying more and more cycling and food in coming days J When I left the home, I was not the only one affected, so was my family. But beyond all of the misery, missing and home-sickness was a dream that I saw together with them. I don't think Thank you is enough for their unconditional support and constant strength they provided to my wings due to which I could fly high. It is very correctly said by Benjamin Bratt, \"My sense of personal strength has always come from my family.\" I am grateful to aai, baba, kaka, kaku, Niketa, Bhargavi, Mihir and my in-laws for my whole life, especially my mother who is my life support system and motivated me in the darkest of the times by reminding about the dream and not giving up come what may. Also my late grandmother, Aaji, who always believed in me and always, inspired me to excel in whatever I do. When I started my PhD I had never ever thought of falling in love as I was so clear about my ambition! But I met Viraj and fell in love with this extremely smart, talented and beautiful soul.
