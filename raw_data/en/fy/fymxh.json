This Piece connects how racialized notions regarding which lives are disposable are reflected widely in the areas of health and human rights. The presumed expendability of Black lives is made manifest from systemic police violence, to the devastating ra cially disproportionate impact of COVID-19,8 to historic and ongoing medical experimentation, and to inequitable vaccine access.9 The twin pandemics of systemic racism and COVID-19 have heightened the visibility of the disposability with which society views the lives of people of color. The cumulative effect of this disposability furthers the devaluation of subordinated groups. Through exploring the theme of disposability, this Piece claries the roles of international human rights law, global public health, and international intellectual property law in either advancing racial justice efforts or contributing toward racial subordination.

Notoriously, Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, kneed George Floyd to death for over nine minutes. 10 During this time, George Floyd told officers, \"I can't breathe\" more than twenty times while the officer's knee remained on his neck. 11 The officers treated him as disposable. In Louisville, several police officers shot and killed Breonna Taylor, an EMT worker who was sleeping when the police forcibly entered her home attempting to enforce a no-knock warrant. 12 Additionally, a former police officer killed Ahmaud Arbery for \"jogging while Black\" in Brunswick, Georgia.13 The banal circumstances surrounding their deaths indicate the precariousness of Black lives and the ease with which our lives can be disposed. The public health community has belatedly recognized that addressing police violence is a public health issue. 14 Mr. Floyd's death vividly illustrates the relationship between police brutality, systemic racism, and health equity. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner's autopsy report indicates that he was positive for COVID-19 at the time of his death. 15 It also observes that he was likely asymptomatic with persistent positivity from a previous infection.16 Mr. Floyd's positive test for COVID-19 on April 3, 2020 occurred nearly eight 10.

During the uprising, people across the globe joined together demanding full equality, acco untability, and an end to police bru- tality and systemic racial injustice. 21 In the United States, the response to the Black Lives Matter uprising and all ies protesting racial subordination included substantial militarization with armor ed vehicles, curfews, tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber and wooden bullets.22 The ongoing racial reckoning has illuminated how quickly and swiftly some states are willing to deploy the military and the police to quell those agitating for racial justice.

The COVID-19 pandemic implicates several fundamental human rights, including protections against the arbitrary deprivation of life and the \"right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.\" 34 Under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), affected states are to take primary responsibility to prevent, treat, and control diseases. 35 Addition- ally, a fundamental principle of economic, social, and cultural rights is that a state should \"take steps . . . to the maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively\" the right to health as well as other economic, social, and cultural rights. 36 Notably, only state parties to the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights are accountable for compliance with it. 37 Moreover, under the ICESCR, state parties \"undertake to prohibit and to eliminate racial discrimination in all its forms and to guarantee the right of everyone, without distinction as to race, color, or national or ethnic origin, to equality before the law\" in the right to public health, amongst others. 38 Further, the International Covenant on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) regime broadly denes racial discrimi-nation to encompass any \"distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, color, descent, or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or 33.

Moreover, the availability of disparate impact claims in the United States has been severely hampered due to require-ments that claims reach a certain threshold level of signicance and demonstrate a causal relationship, and by the business necessity defense. 41 Internationally, disparate impact claims have not been hollowed out to the same extent, which is welcome news for those hoping to challenge racial-ized global health inequities seen with COVID-19. CERD potentially creates an avenue for destabilizing racialized health inequities, because under the Convention, state parties are supposed to \"take effective measures to review governmental, national and local poli- cies, and to amend, rescind or nullify any laws and regulations which have the effect of creating or perpetuating racial discrimination wherever it exists.\" 42 The CERD regime is potentially very useful for addressing racialized health inequities because its applicability goes beyond laws and policies that are invidious by design. By focusing on the impact and effects of laws, policies, and actions, the CE RD regime supplies fertile ground for generating creative challenges to ra cialized health inequities observed with COVID-19. While the CERD framework is laudable in signicant ways, it faces several obstacles in effectively combatting racialized health inequities. For example, Article 2 of the Convention provides: State Parties shall, when the circumstances so warrant, [to account for] the social, economic, cultural and other elds, special and concrete measures to ensure the adequate development and protection of certain racial groups or individuals belonging to them, for the purpose of guaranteeing them the full and equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 43 CERD's state-centric framework prioritizes \"groups or individuals belonging\" to states and may fundamentally curtail the ability to raise transnational or global racial justice claims. 44 Further, the Convention en- visions the creation of limited state-based programs when both global and 39.

Additionally, the Convention cautions that any affirmative action measures \"shall in no case entail as a consequence the maintenance of unequal or separate rights for different racial groups after the objectives for which they were taken have been achieved.\" 45 This temporal limitation could be read narrowly in ways that inhibit the ability to address the continued effects of racial subordination in health that inform the trajectory of the COVID -19 pandemic. Alternatively, this provision could theoretically appl y until state actors achieve substantive equality in health. Overall, the CERD regime potentially creates a useful platform for legal and institutional reform. Ultimately, addressing the impact of racial inequities in global health exhibit ed during the COVID-19 pandemic requires signicant legal and institutional restructuring to shift how people, society, and laws respond to diseases depending on which racial populations are deemed disposable. 46 III. DISPOSABLE LIVES AND EXPERIMENTAL TRIALS The discussion between the doctors in the Introduction reveals the way that disposability and medical neocolonialism are intertwined and reflexively invoked. 47 The concept of medical neocolonialism aptly characterizes the pattern of extraction of resources from Black and other people of color for experimental clinical trials.48 The knowledge gener- ated from this research is subsequently utilized for the development of new treatments and drugs. However, the subjects of the research and their communities generally do not share equitably in the benets of these innovations. 49 Medical neocolonialism draws on many of the characteris- tics of historical colonialism in that it is similarly driven by economic dependence, exploitation, inequality, and the treatment of communities of color as disposable. Given the stark racial disparities witnessed with COVID-19, there is understandable skepticism that COVID-19 vaccines will be used to help subordinated groups, since we have generally not been protected in the rst place. An Associated Press nationwide poll conducted between May 14-18, 2020 (approximately a week before the police killed Mr. Floyd), revealed that, while 56% of White peop le were willing to take a potential COVID-19 vaccine, only 37% of Latinx and 25% of Black people would do 45.

Indeed, the sordid history of human experimentation carried out on Black and other people of color has reinforced the disposable nature with which our lives are regarded: from J.

For example, in 1996, during the worst ever meningitis outbreak on the African continent, Pzer conducted a clinical trial in which a hundred children in Nigeria were given an experimental oral antibiotic called Trovan, while an additional hundred received Ceftriaxone. 59 Five children died on the former antibiotic and six on the latter.60 Some chil- dren allegedly received a dose lower than recommended, \"leaving many children with brain damage, paralysis, or slurred speech.\"61 The parents of the children sued Pzer for failure to obtain informed consent and Pzer settled the suit with the drug trial victims after a protracted fteen-year legal battle. 62 Moreover, early research trials conducted in Uganda for an AIDS vaccine were designed to test the safe ty of HIV Subtype B\u2014a type most prevalent in Europe and the Americas.63 HIV has more than ten major subtypes, which correspond with geographical range;64 Subtype D is the dominant form in East Africa.65 Thus, the research done in Uganda tested a vaccine designed to attack a virus subtype not prevalent in Uganda.66 Developers wanted a vaccine for Subtype B of HIV to market to high-income countries in Europe and elsewhere in the Global North. 67 58.

Furthermore, they indicate the limitations of the guidelines' ability to protect the rights and welfare of Black and other people of color. 77 Moreover, even where legal and regulatory frameworks exist on paper for study participants, the de facto policy of treating Black, Indige nous, and other people of color as disposable requires more robust mechanisms to counteract the praxis of dehumanization. Accordingly, the unethical treatment and exploitation of subordinated groups informs the hesitancy of some to participate in clinical trials and to sign up for the COVID-19 vaccines authorized for emergency use. IV. DISPOSABLE LIVES AND ACCESS TO VACCINES Importantly, however, the turn to \"vaccine hesitancy\" to account for the gross disparities in the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines obscures structural, legal, and policy barriers to access. For example, vaccine redlining policies have located many distribution centers outside of communities of color in the United States. Indeed, officials in Dallas County had to stop a plan prioritizing CO VID-19 vaccine doses for people living in the most vulnerable zip codes after the state of Texas threatened to cut off the county's vaccine supply. 78 Moreover, preliminary data from states that track vaccination data by race indicate that COVID-19 vaccines are primarily going to White people, desp ite the fact that the pandemic is ravaging communities of color disproportionately.79 Commentators 77.

Globally, vaccine redlining has meant that people living in many countries in the Global South are not expected to have signicant doses of vaccines administered until as late as 2024. 81 Some of this delay is the result of limited su pply, lack of production facilities, and logistical impediments, such as the need for vaccine storage at subzero temperatures requiring the development of a cold distribution chain for vaccine administration. 82 Moreover, international solidarity has been wanting; instead, vaccine nationalism has predominated, with some countries prioritizing and competing for bilateral deals and hoarding enough supplies to vaccinate their populations several times over. 83 Indeed, some analyses indicate that rich countries are on track to hoard over one billion COVID-19 vaccines.84 Further, the European Union us/vaccine-racial-disparities.html (on le with the Columbia Law Review ); Only One U.S. State Has Vaccinated 10% of Its Black Populat ion: COVID-19 Tracker, Bloomberg (Feb. 24, 2021), https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/cov id-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/ us-vaccine-demographics.html (on le with the Columbia Law Review ). 80.

Further, even if the COVAX initiative were fully funded, a philanthropic model that relies on the municence of others to donate money or share vaccine surpluses is fundamentally flawed, given the need for countries to vaccinate entire populations. In late February 2021, Ghana became the rst country to receive vaccine doses under this scheme. 89 Yet, the late \"timing and the relatively modest supply\u2014enough for just 1% of Ghana's population\u2014point to major challenges\" 90 moving forward.

This is compounded by Moderna's (manufacturer of one of the most expensive COVID-19 vaccines 101) earlier indication that it did not plan to distribute its vaccine in South Africa.102 Signicantly, a single dose of the Moderna vaccine c osts approximately $32-$37 and has an efficacy of approximately 95%.103 While Moderna pledged not to enforce its patent during the COVID-19 pandemic,104 it does not own all the patents in its vaccine.105 Accordingly, Moderna cannot make credible commitments that bind other patentholders.

The political economy explanation also does not consider how market failures for pharmaceuticals aimed at diseases that disproportionately impact people of color are tied to long histories of exploitation, dispossession, and devaluation of the lives of Black, Indigenous, and other people of color. A thorough analysis of COVID-19 vaccine apartheid and disposability must also consider the role of the international intellectual property regime in severely compounding the challenges of equitable vaccine distribution. Briefly, the international intellectual property regime provides a twenty-year monopoly for pharmaceuticals. 107 Until the creation of this regime, many countries did not even place patent protection on pharmaceuticals. Previously, state s regarded patent rights as a national prerogative rather than a minimum international substantive regime with standards for what intellectual prop erty rights protections countries should adopt. Recognizing this, the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreeme nt grants extra implementation time to developing countries and delayed implementation for the least-developed countries. 108 Although the DOHA Declaration, which reaffirms the TRIPS Agreement, and some TRIPS provisions were meant to create better flexi- bilities for public health or incentivize research and development, they have had limited effect in facilitating access to medicines, 109 given the 107. See Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights art. 33, Apr. 15, 1994, 1869 U.N.T.S. 299 [hereinafter TR IPS Agreement] (\"The term of protection available [for patents] shall not end before the expiration of a period of twenty years counted from the ling date.\"). 108.

Overall, the intellectual property regime shelters corporations from competition, enables them to increase prices, un derproduces certain drugs, cuts back on product quality, and declines to produce some pharmaceuticals. 118 Vaccines in particular have been deprioritized by the pharmaceutical industry as insufficiently protable.

Yet, there is an insufficient supply of vaccines in part because pharmaceutical companies exercise their monopoly power to prevent others from accessing the publicly funded technologies needed to create the vaccines. For example, in 2020, the WHO created a technology access pool to encourage pharmaceutical companies to share their knowledge with manufacturers in other countries that need to develop vaccines, but not one company has done so at the time of writing. 123 Against this background, in October 2020, India and South Africa requested that the Council for TRIP S recommend a waiver from the implementation, application, and enforcement of certain provisions of the TRIPS Agreement. 124 They argued that a waiver was needed to prevent, contain, and treat COVID-19, given the acute health shortages faced by 119.

The joint submission is wide-ranging and covers not only patents, but also copyright, industrial designs, and undisclosed information including know-how and trade secrets. 128 The purpose of the temporary ban would be to allow mul- tiple actors to start production, instead of limiting manufacturing to the small number of current patent-holders, which limits access and renders signicant numbers of people disposable.

The opposing countries maintain that equitable access can be achieved through voluntary licens-ing and technology transfer arrangements, among other means. 133 Yet, this Piece has already illustrated the severe constraints of voluntary transfer arrangements, 134 and as South Africa's rst intervention before the TRIPS Council aptly put it, \"the proble m with philanthropy is that it cannot buy equality.\"135 Given the diametrically opposed positions on the proposal, reaching a consensus (which is the way most decisions are made) in the TRIPS Council is unlikely in the immediate future. 136 Accordingly, the goal of delivering \"triple billion\" COVID-19 vaccine doses to the world's most vulnerable populations appears elusive given the current impasse. 137 In January 2021, the Director-General of the WHO warned that the world is on the \"brink of a catastrophic moral failure-- 130.

Rich Countries Hoarding COVID Vaccines, supra note 83. 94 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW FORUM [Vol. 121:5 and the price of this failure will be paid with lives and livelihoods in the world's poorest countries.\"138 If the current course is not corrected, vaccine apartheid will only deepen, and the resulting maldistribution will render historically subordinated groups even more disposable. That exacerbating racial subjugation was not the intention of law and policymakers in the intellectual property regime when structuring legal incentives for research and pharmaceutical innovation is immaterial. Indeed, this does not render the impact of further entrenching racial subordination any less acute. Nor does it alleviate the obligation of actors to remedy the inequitable racialized disparities with vaccine access that have resulted with COVID-19. C ONCLUSION The twin pandemics of COVID-19 and systemic racism and the responses to halt their spread have fundamentally challenged the status quo. The uprising and its insistence on the value of Black lives creates an opening to rethink, reshape, and create new possibilities for antisubordi- nation efforts. Yet, as this Piece shows, the presumption of the disposability of people of color implicitly persists in disparate areas of law and policy. This Piece highlights several areas for reformation and restructuring. Fur-ther research should aim to reconcile the inconsistencies between the rights to health and equality provided by international human rights law on the one hand and trade-related intellectual property rights on the other. Additionally, addressing systemic police violence, racialized global health inequities, and medical expe rimentation and exploitation, as well as vaccine apartheid and redlining, will require a signicant level of legal reform and restructuring to counteract years of entrenched racial subor-dination. This Piece makes clear that changing the baseline of disposability is required to begin to shift how people, society, and laws respond to Black lives now and in the future. 138. Id. "}
