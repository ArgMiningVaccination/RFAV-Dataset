This collaborative team of professionals contribute their varied expertise to create a personalized treatment plan with each patient at its center. Breast Cancer NorthShore was the first program in the Chicago region to be accredited by the American College of Surgeons' National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers. We have a newly established high-risk screening program that includes formal risk assessment and lifestyle modifications. Gastrointestinal Cancer Our multidisciplinary team focuses on early detection and advanced therapeutics, including minimally invasive surgical and advanced interventional radiology techniques. We look for genetic predisposition for colon cancer in all patients with colon cancer. Gynecologic Cancer NorthShore's Clinical Gynecologic Cancer Prevention Program includes ovarian cancer risk assessment and individualized pharmacological and surgical strategies for screening and prevention. Head and Neck Cancers Kellogg Cancer Center's collaborative specialists offer the latest diagnostics and personalized treatment plans for head and neck cancers, including robotic surgery for appropriate patients and clinical trials focusing on minimizing toxicity in patients at lower risk of relapse. Hematology NorthShore's hematology program received an award for 10 years of continuous accreditation from the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy (FACT). Lung Cancer NorthShore's emphasis on early detection allows our experienced team of specialists to diagnose a greater proportion of early-stage lung cancer cases, leading to improved outcomes. We routinely look for genetic alterations within tumors that will optimize the use of molecularly targeted therapies. Melanoma NorthShore is one of the few institutions in the region to offer sophisticated immunotherapy for advanced melanoma patients and early access to clinical trials of new immunotherapies. Neurologic Oncology Ongoing clinical trials provide NorthShore patients with brain tumors access to the latest drugs and innovative treatment options.Pancreatic Cancer Our clinical pancreatic database is one of the largest in the country, and NorthShore's ongoing studies support novel, personalized treatment plans. In 2014, NorthShore Kellogg Cancer Center was selected by the Association of Community Cancer Centers as a Community Resource Center for Pancreatic Cancer, enhancing a pathway to increased collaboration within a network of community cancer center providers willing to share their knowledge and expertise in caring for patients with less common cancers. Prostate Cancer The NorthShore Division of Urology has been repeatedly ranked among the top 100 urology programs in the United States by U.S. News & World Report. There is a major clinical and research focus on understanding who requires treatment and who can be observed safely without treatment. Kellogg Cancer Center's multidisciplinary approach provides optimal cancer treatment for each of our patients. Bringing together physician specialists with expertise in specific cancers, as well as clinical and psychosocial staff involved in a patient's treatment, provides a forum for blending their collective knowledge, skills and experience. The result: an individual- ized cancer plan tailored to each patient. NorthShore is part of the Mayo Clinic Care Network, which provides our patients even greater access to a broad network of experts. NorthShore and Mayo specialists share expertise and collaborate on complex disease diagnoses and treatments. Patients at NorthShore benefit from this enhanced care without the need to travel outside the region. Multidisciplinary teams are at the heart of advanced, comprehensive care for Kellogg Cancer Center patients.

The Center is dedicated to incorporating genomic information and delivering personalized patient care, employing the latest genetic technology and information. The Center for Medical Genetics is committed to hereditary cancer research at both the clinical and transla-tional levels. The Center offers an experienced team of medical geneticists and genetic counselors working collaboratively with referring physicians, patients and their families to incorporate genetics and genomics into the practice of medicine. Such personal- ized care can lead to tailored screening, prevention and treatment that can be life-saving. Staff at the Center for Medical Genetics evaluate patients diagnosed with cancer as well as assess those potentially at risk for a hereditary cancer syndrome. In medical genetics, the family is the patient. Patient services at the Center for Medical Genetics include an extensive evaluation of an individual's personal and family medical history, risk assessment, and relevant genetic testing if indicated and desired. Patients can also receive guidance regarding management, screening, early detection and prevention of disease by incorporating current genetic information. The Center for Medical Genetics also remains committed to international collaborations such as the IMPACT study, which is examining prostate cancer risk in BRCA1/2 carriers as well as families with Lynch syndrome. Not all instances of cancer are hereditary, however. Many factors\u2014including lifestyle, environmental exposures and diet\u2014also come into play. In fact, most cancers\u2014 between 85 to 90 percent\u2014are not inherited. Genetic counseling provides the best way to determine genetic suscep-tibility to cancer, followed by genetic testing, if applicable.CENTER FOR PERSONALIZED MEDICINE Personalized medicine, also referred to as individualized or precision medicine, customizes a patient's care and treatment plan based on his or her unique genetic characteristics and health history. Through this level of personalized care, NorthShore's Center for Personalized Medicine is able to more effectively develop a system of anticipating risk of certain cancers in a patient. Then, strategies are established to prevent the cancer, as well as better diagnose and treat cancers when they occur. In collaboration with NorthShore's Centers for Medical Genetics and Molecular Medicine, the Center for Personalized Medicine is a new systemwide initiative launched in 2014 that uses the knowledge of the human genome and specialized tests based on the genome to study it. The Center for Personalized Medicine takes a team approach to providing patients with personalized care. Physicians and scientists customize the most effective treatment plans for patients and develop effective disease-prevention strategies based specifically on their unique genetic blueprints. This unique expertise includes healthcare informatics, laboratory testing, medical genetics and innovative research. This multidisciplinary team, through the integration of sophisticated genomic and health history information, can seamlessly provide patients with the best possible methods for preventing, predicting and treating various diseases and conditions. The Center for Personalized Medicine enables our physicians to learn more about our patients on a molecular level. With a better understanding of an individual's unique genetic code and genomic information, NorthShore's team of physician-scientists and researchers can develop individualized prevention and treatment options that positively impact patient care. At NorthShore Kellogg Cancer Center, we advocate for patients to know their family health histories, which play a critical role in preventive care and screenings to protect them from life-threatening disease like cancer. A personal health history plays an essential role in early detection of cancer. NorthShore's emphasis on early detection allows our experi - enced team of specialists to diagnose a greater proportion of early-stage cancer cases. When cancer is detected early, patients have more options for treatment as well as greater chances for improved treatment outcomes. Cancer treatment options are rapidly evolving, and Kellogg Cancer Center is on the leading edge of care with a variety of resources that improve prevention, treatment and surveillance of many types of the disease.

In 2014, NorthShore became the first healthcare system in the country to use Health Heritage, a new online tool that helps individuals create personalized risk reports. It links to their current Electronic Medical Record (EMR) for seamless communication with their physicians. Health Heritage allows patients to: Create a family health history by automatically and securely downloading HIGH-RISK BREAST AND OVARIAN HEALTH PROGRAMkey parts of their medical record from their NorthShore EMR Generate personalized health risk reports and recommendations that can be shared with their physicians and used to create personalized screening and prevention plans Review, add and update health informa-tion that relates to their risk of developing common inherited health conditions such as cancer The dynamic program automatically links to a person's current EMR, allowing the addition of family medical histories. Health Heritage then analyzes personal and family health history, and provides specific screening recommendations based upon the most current research. It also offers a risk assessment report to develop person- alized plans and treatment options for patients. With Health Heritage, NorthShore's patients and their families have a powerful foundation on which to build personalized plans for improving their health, and potentially the health of family members. This secure, dynamic, family health history also will be an essential part of the legacy that our patients will leave for future generations. NorthShore has established high-risk programs in breast and ovarian health that feature a multidisciplinary team of experts. New patients undergo a thorough review of health and family history, in addition to a review of imaging, a clinical breast exam or pelvic exam. In addition, statistical risk models to stratify individual risk of breast or ovarian cancer are used. Personalized risk assessment and screening plans are developed for each patient, and education on risk-reduction strategies are key components of the programs. The goal of the high-risk evaluation programs for breast and ovarian health is to educate patients about their risks and determine whether they need additional tests or visits in the clinic. The programs also can reassure some patients that their risk for developing these cancers is not greater than the general population. Patients can participate in research studies that allow NorthShore to examine better ways to prevent and assess risk of breast and ovarian cancer. The high-risk breast and ovarian programs at NorthShore empower women to be proactive for their overall health, and to create an important information legacy for family members and future generations. Philanthropic support has been vital to the programs, including a $1 million grant from the North Suburban Healthcare Foundation to launch the high-risk breast program. Additionally, Sandy and Ron Schutz made a generous gift to further advance ovarian cancer research and promote oncology nursing education at NorthShore. Kellogg Cancer Center patients benefit from programs designed to serve women at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer. Among the leaders of these efforts are (from left) Collaborative Nurse Ann Puglisi, Dr. Gustavo Rodriguez, Dr. Katharine Yao and Nurse Practitioner Barb Guido.Page 4 NorthShore University HealthSystem For more information, visit northshore.org/cancer or call (847) 570-2112 DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT MEDICAL ONCOLOGY At Kellogg Cancer Center, each patient receives care from a multidisciplinary team that represents a variety of physicians and healthcare professionals. Medical oncolo- gists specialize in treating patients with chemotherapy and other medications, and they also are the primary manager of each patient's multidisciplinary team. NorthShore is certified by the American Society of Clinical Oncology Quality Oncology Practice Initiative as a premier medical provider for practicing the highest stan- dards for quality cancer care. Medical oncologists diagnose and stage a patient's specific form of cancer and begin mapping out a treatment plan. Diagnosis, staging and recommendations for treat- ment require open communication and intense collaboration with other members of the multidisciplinary team. NorthShore's use of one of the most advanced Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems in the country enhances open communication and promotes collaboration in patient care.Once a treatment plan is put into place, patients meet regularly with their medical oncologist, who monitors their progress and manages symptoms and side effects of treatment. As a result of this monitoring and close communication with patients, medical oncologists can make further assessments and recommendations for treatment. Kellogg Cancer Center has on staff medical oncologists representing a wide variety of subspecialties. Like their colleagues in surgical oncology and radiation oncology, medical oncologists are active participants and leaders in regional and national research, academic and advocacy organizations. This experience and insight, along with a vital research enterprise, allows Kellogg Cancer Center patients access to the latest drugs and treatment options, as well as a wide array of clinical trials, both at NorthShore and through the University of Chicago.For the majority of patients at NorthShore Kellogg Cancer Center, a multidisciplinary meeting of special - ists convenes to collectively review details of their diagnosis at disease- specific tumor conferences. This so-called \"meeting of the minds\" provides a forum for all the medical professionals whose critical input creates a comprehensive, individual - ized treatment plan. This team includes medical oncologists, surgical pharma - cists, nutritionists and social workers, among others. This personalized approach creates the best course of action for each patient. Personalized medicine takes shape at these conferences. Review of tumor pathology slides may lead to more in-depth molecular testing of specimens to characterize specific biomarkers, affording the use of more effective, targeted medicines. This may occur with FDA-approved drugs, or for others, through participation in clinical trials that are helping advance cancer care. Based upon this forum of discussion, appropriate diagnostic tests may be applied to define optimal therapy; the order of therapy; and specific treatment recommendations that may include surgery, radiation, targeted therapy, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy or a novel clinical trial. Collaborative, multidisciplinary teams like Drs. Mark Sisco (from Mihir Bhayani, Vathsala Raghavan and Bruce Brockstein provide compassionate and sophisticated care for oncology patients.

The Department of Radiation Medicine is accredited by the American College of Radiology for each of NorthShore's treatment facilities located at Evanston, Glenbrook and Highland Park Hospitals. NorthShore was one of the first Chicago area medical centers to inaugurate the new radionuclide therapy for prostate cancer bone metastases using the alpha-emitting radionuclide radon-223. Reported results indicate improved survival and fewer side effects compared to chemotherapy. NorthShore has been a leader in the development of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) for patients with early-stage breast cancer, reducing the time for treatment from six and a half weeks to three weeks. More than 600 women have been treated to date with results compa-rable to standard therapy. NorthShore's stereotactic body radiation therapy program continues to grow as an option for many patients offering pinpoint precision to target radiation treatment on tumors or lesions close to critical structures within the body. Stereotactic body radiation offers doctors the ability to treat a range of indications, including benign and malignant brain tumors; metastatic tumors or recurrent brain tumors; functional brain disorders; and tumors of the head and neck, lung, liver, prostate and spine. This treatment is particularly viable for patients who cannot undergo traditional surgery because of illnesses, for tumors that are located in inoperable areas or for procedures that present increased risk of harming critical structures near the tumor. The therapy is especially effective for patients with early- stage lung cancer who are deemed to be poor operative risks. SURGICAL ONCOLOGY NorthShore's Department of Surgery and Division of Surgical Oncology offer comprehensive surgical oncology care to patients at Kellogg Cancer Center by physicians who are specially trained in treating breast, endocrine, lung, gastro-intestinal, hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancers, head and neck cancers, mela- noma and sarcoma. NorthShore's Kellogg Cancer Center has had an American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer (CoC) accredited cancer program since its founding in 1981. NorthShore was granted the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) Participant User File (PUF). PUFs are only available through an application process to investi-gators associated with CoC-accredited cancer programs. The NCDB is the world's largest cancer database, which includes approximately 70 percent of all cancer patients treated in the United States. The Patient User Files of the NCDB provide investigators with a data resource they can use to review and advance the quality of care delivered to cancer patients through analyses of cases reported to the NCDB. This has allowed NorthShore to conduct research in cancer across the United States. The NorthShore Center for Biomedical Research Informatics (CBRI) maximizes NorthShore's robust electronic resources and systemwide, fully integrated Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system. The CBRI includes 30 bioinformatics scientists, statisticians and staff who partner with the Department of Surgery, as well as other cancer care providers, on projects that require biostatistics and informatics in order to improve patient care. Over the past several years, in collaboration with the CBRI, NorthShore surgeons have developed comprehensive databases in pancreatic, prostate, colorectal, lung and breast surgery that allow complete, timely and accurate collection of both clinical and research data from all our patients, simultaneously improving both clinical care and research. RADIOLOGY NorthShore's Department of Radiology provides expert diagnosis and treatment of cancer with a multitude of procedures. Every patient's health issue is unique as are the procedures used by the NorthShore radiologists. Advancements in medical technology allow our physicians to use the most effective method for diagnosing and treating cancer. Experts in treating lung cancer, thoracic surgeons Dr. John Howington (from left) and Dr. Ki Wan Kim partner with medical oncologists Dr. Thomas Hensing and Dr. Nicholas Campbell.Continued on page 7 >Page 6 NorthShore University HealthSystem For more information, visit northshore.org/cancer or call (847) 570-2112 NURSE NAVIGATORS\u2014Providing Compassionate Direction from Diagnosis to Treatment and Beyond For many patients at Kellogg Cancer Center, a cancer diagnosis can be an all-encompassing effort. Educa-tion, treatment decisions, and juggling professional and family responsibilities are but a few of the issues patients must deal with from their initial diagnosis and throughout the course of their care. In addition to their multispecialty care team, patients who are newly diagnosed at Kellogg Cancer Center have the added support of a specialized oncology nurse navigator to help guide them through their diagnosis and treatment. This initial, compassionate connection is an important advantage for patients, providing personalized expertise and sustained direction throughout a patient's care. Nurse navigators connect with patients immediately after diagnosis and proceed to help navigate through the complexities of their illness. Our navigators have direct access to all of the resources at the Kellogg Cancer Center locations at Evanston, Glenbrook and Highland Park Hospitals\u2014imaging facilities, surgical suites, radiation therapy facilities and support services. With patients, they discuss their diagnosis and assist with needed appointments. Working collab- oratively with physicians, they provide personalized education and serve as a critical, direct point of contact for patients who have questions about their diagnosis and treatment. Nurse navigators help patients deal with myriad issues throughout their care. Using resources both on-site at Kellogg Cancer Center and within the community where patients live, they help connect patients to a variety of resources to address their individual needs. Throughout their treatment, patients continue to have the support of a care team composed of physicians and collaborative nurses from medical oncology, surgical oncology and radiation oncology. The collaborative nurse is present when the patient meets with the physician. He or she helps coordinate the treatment plan, commu- nicating with members of the multidisciplinary team and the patient to ensure continuity of care. Nurse navigators continue to support patients with consultation referrals and integration of many key Kellogg Cancer Center services, including patient advocates, nutritionists, social workers, integrative medicine practitioners, oncology pharmacists and others. In their roles, nurse navigators and the collaborative nursing team can provide patients with the \"big picture\" and anticipate the progression of their care and treatment. The orchestration of these steps is complex but occurs with decreased patient responsibility. Such assistance eases the burden for patients, allowing them to focus on working through their treatment and returning to wellness, by alleviating a substantial time commitment associated with sequential referrals from specialist to specialist. Even with the strongest support system in place, a diagnosis of cancer can be the biggest challenge a patient may ever face. Our team of oncology nurses provides both compassionate support and clinical expertise as they serve as a strong patient advocate. Nurse navigators are key members of Kellogg Cancer Center patient care teams. Pictured here, from left, are Beth Weigel, Margaret Whalen, Gail Ronkoske, Jade Distajo and Martha McCurdy. For more information, visit northshore.org/cancer or call (847) 570-2112 NorthShore University HealthSystem Page 7 Patients at Kellogg Cancer Center have a wide range of advanced imaging capabili-ties available to them if deemed critical to their diagnosis and treatment, including diversified breast imaging technology, CT scan, diagnostic X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound and interventional radiology. In addition, patients have available to them more sophisticated MRI technology and a variety of isotope-based imaging including PET scanning. Kellogg Cancer Center is committed to the early detection of breast disease and advancements in women's health. As a pre-eminent imaging center in the Chicago region and a leader in breast cancer prevention, NorthShore offers state-of-the- art breast imaging technology, including digital mammography, ultrasound and MRI. All images are interpreted by dedicated radiologists from the Department of Radiology's Breast Imaging Section. Research shows that interpretation by breast specialty radiologists improves the rate of cancer detection. These radiologists have expertise in the diagnosis of all aspects of breast disease and work closely with surgery, oncology and pathology to provide cohesive patient care. Additionally, NorthShore investigators are studying whether MRI can benefit women diagnosed with high-risk lesions. Patient safety is of top priority, and NorthShore has one of the few radiology programs in the Chicago area that monitors the amount of radiation to which patients are exposed. If the cumulative radiation exposure is approaching the maximum recommended safety levels, radiologists can advise a patient's oncol- ogist on alternative testing. PATHOLOGY Kellogg Cancer Center has been a leader in molecular pathology and diagnostics for more than 20 years. NorthShore's Pathology Department includes board- certified physicians and scientists who are on faculty at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, as well as certified allied health professionals, all of whom have in-depth expertise in oncology.NorthShore's comprehensive, expert pathology lab ensures that a majority of tests and novel diagnostics are completed in-house. This advantage provides swift results to the members of a patient's multidisciplinary team, which are used in each individualized treatment plan. As a result, physicians can begin treatments for cancer as early as possible. Pathologists are on-site and readily available to discuss individual cases with Kellogg Cancer Center physicians, and pathologists also attend multidisciplinary conferences. The expertise of our pathology staff includes subspecialty fellowship training in hematopathology, cytopathology, dermatopathology, molecular pathology and various subspecialty anatomic pathology areas, to name a few. When it comes to molecular pathology, Kellogg Cancer Center has been ahead of the curve, incorporating molecular analysis of tumors into patient care for a number of years. Even cancers that may look the same under the microscope are molecu-larly distinct, and may behave differently and respond differently to therapy. At NorthShore, we are able to analyze blood DNA (germline DNA), as well as the tumor DNA (somatic DNA). Each of these approaches may help clinicians develop additional insight into optimizing interven- tions. As the knowledge and research surrounding tumor biology continues to rapidly improve, this enhanced technology provides patients with new cancer treat- ment options based on their individual molecular and genetic makeup. MEDICAL GENETICS Our research regarding the genetics of cancer, involving both germline and somatic changes, is constantly evolving. All the while, physician-scientists continue to discover the genomic architecture and \"molecular fingerprint\" of a cancer. Such discoveries are leading the way to increased personalized, targeted therapies. NorthShore's Center for Medical Genetics is an increasingly important part of the multidisciplinary team at Kellogg Cancer Center. Not only is the Center assisting patients in prevention and surveillance, it is also playing an increasing role in cancer treatment. Ten to 15 percent of cancers\u2014 Dr. Peter Hulick leads NorthShore's Center for Medical Genetics.Continued from page 5 > Continued >Page 8 NorthShore University HealthSystem For more information, visit northshore.org/cancer or call (847) 570-2112 ORAL CHEMOTHERAPY MONITORING Over the past few years, there has been a major expansion in the develop- ment and use of oral anti-cancer agents (OAA). Although these medications can be taken at home rather than in the cancer center setting, they require stringent monitoring and follow-up. Adherence to oral anti-cancer agents is very challenging because these drugs are expensive, hard to obtain, have strict dosing regimens and can have significant side effects. Monitoring these adverse effects also poses new challenges since patients take these medications at home, away from the watchful eyes of the multi- disciplinary team. To help overcome these challenges, each Kellogg Cancer Center location provides a dedicated, on-site, point-of-care Outpatient Oncology Pharmacy. These specialized pharmacies serve patients at KelloggCancer Center by dispensing oral anti-cancer agents and supportive care medications specific to each patient's treatment plan. The pharmacists also are experienced with requesting authorization from insurance companies and obtaining financial coverage for medications, in conjunction with our patient financial advocates. The Kellogg Cancer Center pharmacies harness the power of NorthShore's Electronic Medical Record (EMR), using important information to help ensure safety. The Center's pharmacy department has worked with the multidisciplinary team to pursue several quality improvement projects specific for oral anti-cancer agents. A special messaging system within the EMR allows oncology pharmacists to provide a double check for all OAA prescriptions, including prescriptions sent to pharmacies outside of NorthShore. A monitoring program is being piloted in a small number of patients focusing on certain select high-risk oral anti-cancer agents. This program uses an innovative monitoring tool within the EMR system, which helps healthcare providers assess adherence and side effects of oral chemotherapy regimens. Recent research has shown that a patient's oral chemotherapy success is closely linked to the follow-up contact from pharmacists. Kellogg Cancer Center's on-site Outpatient Oncology Pharmacies enhance patient safety and overall continuity of care. including breast, ovarian, colon and uterine cancer\u2014are caused by a genetic suscep-tibility typically passed through a patient's family. Learning whether a hereditary susceptibility is contributing to a personal and/or family history of cancer can help people affected with either the disease or the genetically defined predisposition. The genetic counseling and genetic testing offered at NorthShore's Center for Medical Genetics can assist in medical decision making for people with cancer. NorthShore's medical geneticists and genetic counselors are often a part of a patient's multidisciplinary treatment team. They partner closely with Kellogg Cancer Center oncologists to arrive at the best possible treatment plan. GENOMIC PROFILING Genomic profiling is a key component of personalized medicine, which is the customization of healthcare that integrates information from a person's genome (DNA and genetic variations) or that from their tumor, and applies specific preventive and treatment strategies that will uniquely benefit that individual's clinical condition. Genomic profiling stems from our knowledge of the human genome along with available tools that can be used to effectively study the expression of thousands of genes and create an overall picture of cellular function. The culmination of this combined knowledge enables researchers and physicians to differentiate between cells that are actively dividing, or to see how certain cells respond to a specific Ashton Hullett (left) and Kathryn Schiavo are part of the specially trained oncology pharmacy team enhancing patient safety and care. For more information, visit northshore.org/cancer or call (847) 570-2112 NorthShore University HealthSystem Page 9 At NorthShore Kellogg Cancer Center, the comprehensive, compassionate care offered to our patients is enhanced by the location where that care is received. Patients receive treatment in environments customized to promote healing. They have three Kellogg Cancer Center locations to choose from that provide special amenities to ease the stress of treatment and create an environment to nurture strength and promote good health. In September 2013, Kellogg Cancer Center expanded some of these services to NorthShore's Gurnee Ambulatory Care Center at 7900 Rollins Road, Suite 1100. The new space allows extended access beyond the Kellogg Cancer Center locations at Evanston, Glenbrook and Highland Park Hospitals. Patients and their referring physicians now have the availability of cancer experts close to home in northern Lake County. Referring physicians can send patients for oncology and hematology consulta- tions at the Gurnee location where patients are seen by Kellogg Cancer Center's skilled and knowledgeable staff. In addition to the expertise of the Center's hematologists and oncologists, the location has the convenience of being close by, eliminating lengthy travel for patients living in the area. The Gurnee Ambulatory Care Center provides additional benefits to patients, including on-site lab and radiology services. GURNEE EXPANSION\u2014Extending the Reach of Kellogg Cancer Center's Physicianstreatment. As part of genomic profiling, physicians at Kellogg Cancer Center can make decisions on how to treat a patient based on the genetic makeup of his or her cancer and prescribe an appropriate drug and dosage for that individual. As part of the Center for Personalized Medicine, NorthShore's Genomic Health Initiative was launched in 2014. It is a large-scale study seeking to better understand how an individual's genetic makeup impacts health, wellness and the effective- ness of treatment options. All adult NorthShore patients are being invited to participate in this project. Participants donate a blood sample and allow NorthShore to study remaining biosamples collected for clinical reasons unrelated to this study. All DNA samples and data obtained from patients' Electronic Medical Record (EMR) are de-identified and kept confidential. NorthShore's Genomic Health Initiative is the next major step in advancing medicine by providing patients with individualized healthcare based on their own comprehen- sive genetic profile. The goal is to enroll more than 100,000 individuals in this ongoing study, which will allow NorthShore to study the widest range of genetic variants in DNA and make predections for many different genetic and medical disorders, including cancer, among others. ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD Kellogg Cancer Center has a specialist in every type of cancer. Each specialist is connected in this process with a robust, nationally recognized Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system, effectively collecting all history, diagnostic tests and consulta-tions to maintain a seamless experience that bridges our hospital campuses, medical offices and outpatient centers. This optimizes the continuity of care, allowing the specialists to focus on the patient.

Among our many current trials are: precisely treat patients. NorthShore's Center for Personalized Medicine builds on many of these existing strengths that include a well-established molecular pathology program, medical genetics, genomic profiling, our EMR system, a vast tumor bank and a clinical trials program. The Center supports preven-tive, predictive and personalized care for patients with cancer and is a practical response to the paradigm shift in medicine\u2014an increased emphasis on predicting and preventing disease, and providing personalized therapy when disease occurs. NorthShore's Center for Biomedical Research Informatics (CBRI) provides advanced quantitative strengths critical to the integration and analysis of this data for the individual patient as well as for research analysis. CLINICAL TRIALS At Kellogg Cancer Center, researchers are an integral part of our multidisciplinary care team. Clinical and translational research being carried out at the NorthShore Research Institute ensures that the most promising breakthroughs in the lab are translated into clinical studies that may provide immediate benefit for patients. Clinical trials allow access to new diagnostic tools and new therapies that may identify cancers earlier, prevent recurrence or minimize side effects. For those with advanced cancers, clinical trials may provide a ray of hope when no other treatment options exist. We continue to expand our clinical trial offerings, which allow patients, through their approved participation, access to new treatments before they are widely available. Our growing partnerships with the Mayo Clinic and the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine provide patients at Kellogg Cancer Center access to an even greater variety of trials. n For

Kellogg Cancer Center patients at Evanston, Glenbrook and Highland Park Hospitals have access to experienced integrative medicine practitioners special- izing in acupuncture, Traditional Chinese Medicine and therapeutic massage in a tranquil, private setting. Integrative medicine providers work collaboratively with other members of the oncology team and communicate seam-lessly through the shared Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system. Acupuncture and body work therapies have been associated with a positive impact on a range of quality-of-life issues for patients with cancer including increased energy, strength, appetite, restful sleep, digestive function, and relief of pain, nausea and dry mouth. Laser acupuncture is also available for cancer patients, particularly those dealing with lymphedema or other contra-indications for needles. The low-level laser is a safe and effective, needle-less form of treatment, which offers benefits similar to those of traditional acupuncture. Led by Medical Director Leslie Mendoza Temple, MD, NorthShore's program is an active member of the international Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine, one of the most well-respected academic collectives for integrative medicine in the world. NorthShore Integrative Medicine presented its business and clinical oncology model at the 2013 International Congress for Clinicians in Complementary and Integrative Medicine in Chicago, receiving excellent reviews for their presentation. Thanks to ongoing philanthropic support, including generous donations from former Kellogg Cancer Center patient Vickie Burke, NorthShore is able to provide some free or sliding-scale fee services to patients who could not otherwise afford integrative medicine services, which are not always reimbursed by insurance. Burke credits the acupuncture and bodywork therapies she received while going through chemotherapy with providing both mental and physical relief, and she encourages other patients to consider these complementary treatments. PATIENT SUPPORT SERVICES Individual, patient-centered care at Kellogg Cancer Center includes a wide array of support services designed to help patients maintain the best physical and emotional health throughout their entire cancer journey. Nutrition and Dietary Good nutrition is essential to good health. And while undergoing treatment for cancer, maintaining a healthy diet is especially important and sometimes challenging. Registered dietitians with specialized training in oncology are available for consultation and can work with patients and families to develop nutrition goals and meal plan strategies throughout therapy and into survivorship. All Kellogg Cancer Center patients receive a non-invasive electronic screen which provides referrals to the Kellogg nutrition team and allows timely, supportive care to patients. Patients or family members who would like to learn more about nutrition may also take advantage of this valuable resource. Kellogg Cancer Center's nutrition team also participates in many community outreach activities directed toward the prevention of cancer. Active partner-ships with the Cancer Wellness Centers and support groups such as the local chapter of the Us Too Prostate Cancer Education & Support Network and Pancreatic Cancer Foundation help educate the public about the relationship between nutrition and cancer. Psychosocial Support Kellogg Cancer Center's dedicated Psychosocial Oncology Program features clinical social workers and professional counselors working collaboratively with patients and families to help manage emotional and practical needs to improve quality of life. Many support groups are offered for patients and caregivers, including new groups initiated this year for patients with brain tumors and their caregivers, and those living with advanced cancers and their caregivers. Last year, 71 support groups for breast, prostate, head and neck, and other cancers were offered to our patients and caregivers. A growing partnership with Cancer Wellness Centers brought some of their programs to NorthShore addressing an array of topics, including healthy sleep, talking to children and adolescents about cancer, couples and cancer, sexuality and cancer, and caring for the caregiver. Kellogg Cancer Center is thrilled to now partner with Imerman Angels, a nonprofit organization that matches patients and caregivers with one-on-one mentors. Our patients are serving as mentors and are being matched with mentors who mirror their age, gender and type of cancer. All patients with cancer at NorthShore are screened for distress, now considered the sixth vital sign. If they self-identify or score for significant distress, a member of the psychosocial team will follow up with them. Additionally, our psychosocial support team is engaged in clinical research. Stephanie Horgan, LCSW, is partnering with psychologist Tina Gremore, PhD, on \"CouplesCare,\" a clinical trial aimed at understanding optimal communication between couples undergoing care for head and neck cancer. Financial Advocacy Patient financial advocates meet with new patients who need assistance with a variety of issues. A team of precertification specialists work to have treatment plans preauthorized for insurance payments and can help answer patients' billing questions. Integrative Medicine Medical Director Dr. Leslie Mendoza Temple (left) and dietitian Lori Wyble, along with an array of integrative medicine practitioners, provide complementary care and therapies for cancer patients. For more information, visit northshore.org/cancer or call (847) 570-2112 NorthShore University HealthSystem Page 13For patients who demonstrate significant financial need, financial advocates help coordinate reduced-cost care through state programs, NorthShore's charity care and/or pharmaceutical companies. Financial advocates work as key members of the oncology team. Pharmacy The Kellogg Cancer Center pharmacy team consists of specially trained and nationally certified oncology pharmacists. Each Kellogg Cancer Center location has a dedicated traditional oncology pharmacy as well as an oral chemotherapy pharmacy, and the pharmacy staff partners with physi-cians and nurses to develop individualized medication plans. NorthShore's oncology pharmacists are important resources for patients and are there to help with questions about medications as well as symptom or side effect management. The pharmacy is a key partner in quality improvement projects and clinical trials management. Patient Education Knowledge is power, and patient education is an important element of Kellogg Cancer Center. Thanks to the generous philanthropic support of Debra Korman and the Ira M. Korman Family, a new Resource Center was established for patients at NorthShore Evanston Hospital in memory of former patient Ira Korman. Specially selected books, periodicals and DVDs can be checked out, and two computer stations are equipped with carefully curated links to helpful websites. The Myra Rubenstein Weis Health (MRW) Resource Center at NorthShore Highland Park Hospital also provides educational resources for patients and families looking to stay well-informed. New patients at Kellogg Cancer Center have a one-on-one educational meeting with a collaborative nurse to review their treatment plan and obtain answers to their questions. A comprehensive Patient Education Binder is available online or in print form for new patients. NorthShore sponsors an \"Understanding Cancer\" series of educational programs and is active in community education and outreach. LIFE Cancer Survivorship NorthShore's Living in the Future (LIFE) Cancer Survivorship Program establishes survivorship as a distinct phase of care in the cancer continuum and offers free services to all Kellogg Cancer Center patients. Under the direction of Carol A. Rosenberg, MD, the LIFE Program helps survivors plan for Drs. Jennifer Obel and Michael Marschke are part of NorthShore's important Advance Care Planning initiative. post-treatment life based on the unique risks, exposures and needs of each individual. LIFE provides one-on-one care in the creation of a survivorship care plan, MRW Survivorship 101 seminars and specialized group support. To find out more about LIFE, visit www.northshore.org/LIFE or call (847) 926-5818. With the philanthropic support of the Coleman Foundation, Dr. Rosenberg has created the Living in the Future Cancer Survivorship course. The curriculum provides emerging health professionals, as well as those who are in long-standing practice, with a foundation of attitude, knowledge and skills related to survivorship care.ADVANCE CARE PLANNING Eliciting and documenting a patient's end-of-life views helps maintain comfort, dignity and peace of mind for patients and their families at an often challenging and stressful time of life. NorthShore Kellogg Cancer Center's Advance Care Planning (ACP) initiative was designed to improve quality of life for advanced cancer patients and help ensure that they receive the kind of care they desire. Led by medical oncologist Jennifer Obel, MD, the ACP initiative at NorthShore already has trained many physicians, nurses and social workers about how to comfortably discuss ACP and end-of-life issues with patients. New patients at Kellogg Cancer Center are introduced to ACP with questions about their short- and long-term goals. Then, in a follow-up education session, patients are given an ACP guidebook to help as they contemplate various medical scenarios. When necessary or requested, social work is consulted for families needing additional assistance with these decisions. The latest phase of the initiative involves educating residents through an innova- tive curriculum created in partnership with the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine designed to improve residents' proficiency in ACP outpatient discussions. The curriculum includes four components\u2014an online module, a lecture by a physician with ACP expertise, a video-recorded ACP discussion with a patient and a supervised outpatient encounter with a patient. Residents' response to the new curriculum has been uniformly positive in providing a much-needed hands-on experience.

NorthShore has played an important role as an alpha and then beta site analyzing patient data for the nationally recognized National Cancer Data Base (NCDB), a clinical oncology database jointly sponsored by the American College of Surgeons and the American Cancer Society. With data from close to 3.5 million breast cancer cases collected, the database has been a rich source of productive research for NorthShore's Katharine Yao, MD, Director of the Breast Surgical Program, David J. Winchester, MD, and colleagues, who have written more than 12 peer-reviewed publications and 20 presentations, earning recognition including posters of exceptional merit. Recent studies have focused on treatment trends with respect to surgery and radiation, looking at issues such as partial breast radiation and bilateral mastectomy. Three research fellows have been dedicated to this work. New NorthShore efforts led by Mihir Bhayani, MD, have included studies related to head and neck tumors, and future efforts will expand studies to include other organ sites including lung, gastrointestinal and thyroid cancers.NCDB DATABASES Access to this data-rich, vital database has not only advanced NorthShore's research portfolio and outcomes-driven care, it has also helped physician-scientists at Kellogg Cancer Center further their knowledge to benefit patients all across the country. Drs. Katharine Yao, Mihir Bhayani (center) and Research Associate Erik Liederbach are engaged in innovative research through the nationally regarded National Cancer Data Base (NCDB).Karen Kaul, MD (continued) For more information, visit northshore.org/cancer or call (847) 570-2112 NorthShore University HealthSystem Page 15 Robert Marsh, MD Member, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, GI Committee Editorial Work: Southern Medical Journal, Cancer, Rogers Medical Intelligence Solutions CME Programs, American Journal of Clinical Oncology, Journal of the Pancreas, Lancet Oncology, European Journal of Surgical Oncology, Public Library of Science Invited Discussant, \"Recent Innovations and Cutting-Edge Technologies in Gastroenterology and Urology,\" 2nd International Conference on Gastroenterology & Urology (Gastroenterology\u20142013) 2013 Castle Connolly America's Top Doctors 2013-2014 Jan Nowak, MD Association for Molecular Pathology Economic Affairs Committee, 2009-present;

Of those, 3,719 cases (93 percent) were analytic. By definition, analytic cases are those patients newly diagnosed with malignant neoplasm and/or patients who have received all or part of their first course of treatment at one of our four Hospitals. The remaining 286 cases (7 percent) were non-analytic. Non-analytic cases are patients initially diagnosed and treated at another facility who now are receiving treatment at NorthShore for progression or recurrence of their disease. Details by site are provided in Table 1. Class of Case 2013 Class of Case divides cases into two groups, analytic cases (Class 00-22) and non-analytic cases (Class 30-49). Class 00-14, which account for 3,158 cases, were those malignancies diagnosed at one of our four Hospitals. Once diagnosed with cancer, 2,926 (93 percent) of our patients remained at NorthShore for their treatment. Class 20-22, totaling 561 cases, were diagnosed elsewhere and referred here for treatment. Class 30-40, a total of 286 cases, were diagnosed and treated elsewhere and referred here for treatment of a recurrence or progression of disease. Overall Top Five NorthShore Sites Breast cancer continues to be our top site representing 22 percent of the total analytic cases seen at NorthShore. The next most frequent cancers seen were: lung (9 percent), prostate (8 percent), melanoma (6 percent) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (5 percent). These top five sites represent 51 percent of all newly diagnosed cases. Total percentage may not add up to 51 percent due to rounding. Distribution by American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) Stage for the Top Five Sites Seen at NorthShore Cancer diagnoses are classified into four or five stages depending on the site. Each stage represents how far the tumor has spread from the organ or site of origin, where an increasing value represents more tumor involvement or extension. Eighty-eight per - cent of our breast cancers were diagnosed at an early stage (stages 0, 1 and 2), reflecting the National (85 percent) trend toward early detection. Forty-five percent of our lung cancers (National: 31 percent), 75 percent of our prostate cancers (National: 81 percent), 95 percent of our melanoma (National: 81 percent) and 43 percent of our non-Hodgkin lymphomas (National: 40 percent) were also diagnosed with early-stage disease. With the exception of prostate cancer, for each of the top sites seen at NorthShore, detection at an early stage was higher than that seen nationally. National data was supplied by the 2014 NCDB, Commission on Cancer, ACoS Benchmark Reports (2011 data), the latest year available. Data for NorthShore is from diagnosis year 2013. See Table 2.

Our Living in the Future (LIFE) Cancer Survivorship Program at NorthShore University HealthSystem, established by Carol Rosenberg, MD, in 2007, is the first comprehensive survivorship program to be developed and imple- mented in northern Illinois. The LIFE Survivorship Program was initially offered to breast cancer patients, but has since encompassed all cancer survivors in our cancer care continuum. In 2014 Dr. Rosenberg conducted a retrospective study of all 1,713 patients (2007-2014) who had received a risk adapted visit (RAV) and a survivorship care plan (SCP) to evaluate the degree to which a RAV promotes individualized healthcare and self-management as survivors transition from active treatment to follow-up care. Patients anonymously completed a post-RAV evaluation on the day of their visit and then another evaluation at least one year after their RAV. Respondents to the immediate post-RAV survey scaled statements as strongly agree/agree/ disagree/strongly disagree. The results of these evaluations were reviewed with the following results: 94 percent felt more confident in their ability to communicate information about their cancer treatments to other members of their healthcare team 90 percent felt more comfortable recognizing signs and symptoms to report to their healthcare provider 98 percent had a better appreciation for potentially helpful community programs and services (Percent represents strongly agree and agree) In reviewing the evaluation of the program after at least one year, respondents were asked if the survivor- ship care plan had been useful in any of the five following ways: 1. To summarize medical information 2. To reinforce follow-up care 3. To recognize symptoms to report 4. To identify lifestyle practices that promote health 5. For assistance in identifying local resources for support 100 percent responded that it had been useful in at least 1 way 97 percent responded that it had been useful in at least 2 ways 93 percent responded it had been useful in at least 3 ways 91 percent responded that it had been useful in at least 4 ways 85 percent responded that it had been useful in all 5 ways Also, 72 percent of respondents reported that they had discussed their SCP with their primary care physician or other healthcare provider, 97 percent stated they made at least one positive lifestyle change, 89 percent attended at least one LIFE health promotion seminar, and 80 percent continue to work on wellness goals. Participation in a LIFE survivorship visit following treatment helps survivors construct a useful understanding of their cancer experience to guide self-care behavior and has proven to be a valuable patient resource.LIFE Survivorship Program Proven To Be Valuable Patient ResourceImproving Outcomes For more information, visit northshore.org/cancer or call (847) 570-2112 NorthShore University HealthSystem Page 19 Physician Teams E.

Winchester, MD Kellogg Cancer Center lost one of its foundational figures with the death this October of Nicholas A. Vick, MD, the Ruth Cain Ruggles Chair of Neurology, Emeritus. The founder of NorthShore's Department of Neurology, Dr. Vick was recognized as an early leader in the international field of neuro-oncology and was a long-standing champion for generations of grateful patients, and a mentor and role model to many fellow physicians. His career-long interest in brain tumors led him to publish more than 100 articles and serve on editorial boards of several journals and various NIH (National Institutes of Health) study sections. He was a passionate teacher\u2014graduating classes at Northwestern University Medical School voted him outstanding teacher awards nine times in the 31 years he was on faculty there, before becoming Clinical Professor of Neurology at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine. He was a recipient of the Alumni Award for Distinguished Service from the University of Chicago. His contributions to NorthShore are too numerous to list but include service with distinction as President of the Professional Staff and as the inaugural Chairman of the Physician Philanthropy Champions Committee. He was very active at the national level, including serving as a past Director of the American Board of Neurology and Psychiatry, and a past Vice President of the American Neurological Association. Always a staunch advocate for Kellogg Cancer Center and its patients, Dr. Vick will be missed by many, but will not soon be forgotten.Remembering Physician Leader Nicholas A. Vick, MD Dr. Nicholas A.
