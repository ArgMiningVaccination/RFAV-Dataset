Campus Security The Washington University campus is among the most attractive in the nation and enjoys a safe, relaxed atmosphere. Your personal safety and the security of your property while on campus is a shared responsibility. Washington University has made safety and security a priority through our commitment to a full-time professional police department, use of closed circuit television, card access, good lighting, shuttle services, emergency telephones, and ongoing educational safety awareness programs. The vast majority of crimes that occur on college campuses are crimes of opportunity, which can be prevented. The best protection against crime is an informed, alert campus community. Washington University has developed several programs to help make your experience here a safe and secure one. An extensive network of emergency telephones, including more than 200 \"blue light\" telephones, is connected directly to the University Police Department and can alert the police to your exact location. In addition to the regular shuttle service, an evening walking escort service or mobile Campus Circulator is available on the Danforth Campus. The Campus2Home shuttle will provide a safe ride home for those living in four designated areas off campus \u2014 Skinker- DeBaliviere, Loop South, north of The Loop and just south of the campus \u2014 from 7:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. seven days a week. The shuttle leaves from both the Mallinckrodt Center and the Brookings Drive steps and takes passengers directly to the front doors of their buildings. Shuttle drivers then will wait and watch to make sure passengers get into their buildings safely. The University Police Department is a full-service organization staffed by certified police officers who patrol the campus 24 hours a day throughout the entire year. The Police Department offers a variety of crime prevention programs including a high- security bicycle lock program, free personal-safety whistles, computer security tags, personal safety classes for women and men, property inventory services and security surveys. For more information on these programs, check out the Washington University Police Department website (http://police.wustl.edu).

The university strictly prohibits all smoking and other uses of tobacco products within all university buildings and on university property, at all times. A copy of our complete tobacco-free policy (http://hr.wustl.edu/ policies/Pages/tobaccofreepolicy.aspx) is available on the Human Resources website. Medical Examinations Entering students must provide medical information to Student Health Services. This will include completion of a health historyand a record of all current immunizations. The university strongly recommends appropriate vaccination for meningococcal disease. If students fail to comply with these requirements prior to registration, they will be required to obtain vaccinations for measles, mumps and rubella at Student Health Services, if there is no evidence of immunity. They will be assessed the cost of the vaccinations. Students will be unable to complete registration for classes until all health requirements have been satisfied. If students are unimmunized, they may be barred from classes and from all university facilities, including housing units, if in the judgment of the university their continued presence would pose a health risk to themselves or to the university community. Medical and immunization information is to be given via the Student Health Services (http://shs.wustl.edu) website. All students who have completed the registration process should access the website and create a student profile by using their WUSTL key. Creating a student profile enables a student to securely access the medical history form. Fill out the form and follow the instructions for transmitting it to Student Health Services. Student information is treated securely and confidentially. Student Conduct The University Student Conduct Code sets forth community standards and expectations for Washington University students. These community standards and expectations are intended to foster an environment conducive to learning and inquiry. Freedom of thought and expression is essential to the university's academic mission. Disciplinary proceedings are meant to be informal, fair and expeditious. Charges of non-serious misconduct are generally heard by the student conduct officer. With limited exceptions, serious or repeated allegations are heard by the campuswide University Student Conduct Board or the University Sexual Assault Investigative Board where applicable. Complaints against students that include allegations of sexual assault or certain complaints that include allegations of sexual harassment in violation of the University Student Conduct Code are governed by the procedures found in the University Sexual Assault Investigative Board Policy (https://wustl.edu/about/ compliance-policies/governance/usaib-procedures-complaints- sexual-assault-filed-students) , which is available online or in hard copy from the Title IX coordinator or the director of Student Conduct and Community Standards. Students may be accountable to both governmental authorities and to the university for acts that constitute violations of law and the University Student Conduct Code. For a complete copy of the University Student Conduct Code (https://wustl.edu/about/compliance-policies/academic-policies), visit the university website.Bulletin 2017-18 About Washington University in St. Louis (06/27/17) 10Undergraduate Student Academic Integrity Policy Effective learning, teaching and research all depend upon the ability of members of the academic community to trust one another and to trust the integrity of work that is submitted for academic credit or conducted in the wider arena of scholarly research. Such an atmosphere of mutual trust fosters the free exchange of ideas and enables all members of the community to achieve their highest potential. In all academic work, the ideas and contributions of others must be appropriately acknowledged, and work that is presented as original must be, in fact, original. Faculty, students and administrative staff all share the responsibility of ensuring the honesty and fairness of the intellectual environment at Washington University. Scope and Purpose This statement on academic integrity applies to all undergraduate students at Washington University. Graduate students are governed by policies in each graduate school or division. All students are expected to adhere to the highest standards of behavior. The purpose of the statement is twofold: To clarify the university's expectations with regard to undergraduate students' academic behavior, and To provide specific examples of dishonest conduct. The examples are only illustrative, not exhaustive. Violations of This Policy Include, but Are Not Limited To: 1. Plagiarism Plagiarism consists of taking someone else's ideas, words or other types of work product and presenting them as one's own. To avoid plagiarism, students are expected to be attentive to proper methods of documentation and acknowledgment. To avoid even the suspicion of plagiarism, a student must always: Enclose every quotation in quotation marks and acknowledge its source. Cite the source of every summary, paraphrase, abstraction or adaptation of material originally prepared by another person and any factual data that is not considered common knowledge. Include the name of author, title of work, publication information and page reference. Acknowledge material obtained from lectures, interviews or other oral communication by citing the source (name of the speaker, the occasion, the place and the date). Cite material from the internet as if it were from a traditionally published source. Follow the citation style or requirements of the instructor for whom the work is produced.2. Cheating on an Examination A student must not receive or provide any unauthorized assistance on an examination. During an examination a student may use only materials authorized by the faculty. 3. Copying or Collaborating on Assignments without Permission When a student submits work with their name on it, this is a written statement that credit for the work belongs to that student alone. If the work was a product of collaboration, each student is expected to clearly acknowledge in writing all persons who contributed to its completion. Unless the instructor explicitly states otherwise, it is dishonest to collaborate with others when completing any assignment or test, performing laboratory experiments, writing and/or documenting computer programs, writing papers or reports, and completing problem sets. If the instructor allows group work in some circumstances but not others, it is the student's responsibility to understand the degree of acceptable collaboration for each assignment, and to ask for clarification if necessary. To avoid cheating or unauthorized collaboration, a student should never: Use, copy or paraphrase the results of another person's work and represent that work as one's own, regardless of the circumstances. Refer to, study from or copy archival files (e.g., old tests, homework, solutions manuals or backfiles) that were not approved by the instructor. Copy another's work, or permit another student to copy one's work. Submit work as a collaborative effort if they did not contribute a fair share of the effort. 4. Fabrication or Falsification of Data or Records It is dishonest to fabricate or falsify data in laboratory experiments, research papers or reports or in any other circumstances; to fabricate source material in a bibliography or \"works cited\" list; or to provide false information on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or other document in connection with academic efforts. It is also dishonest to take data developed by someone else and present them as one's own. Examples of falsification include: Altering information on any exam, problem set or class assignment being submitted for a re-grade. Altering, omitting or inventing laboratory data to submit as one's own findings. This includes copying laboratory data from another student to present as one's own; modifyingBulletin 2017-18 About Washington University in St. Louis (06/27/17) 11data in a write-up; and providing data to another student to submit as one's own. 5. Other Forms of Deceit, Dishonesty or Inappropriate Conduct Under no circumstances is it acceptable for a student to: Submit the same work, or essentially the same work, for more than one course without explicitly obtaining permission from all instructors. A student must disclose when a paper or project builds on work completed earlier in their academic career. Request an academic benefit based on false information or deception. This includes requesting an extension of time, a better grade or a recommendation from an instructor. Make any changes (including adding material or erasing material) on any test paper, problem set or class assignment being submitted for a re-grade. Willfully damage the efforts or work of other students. Steal, deface or damage academic facilities or materials. Collaborate with other students planning or engaging in any form of academic misconduct. Submit any academic work under someone else's name other than one's own. This includes but is not limited to sitting for another person's exam; both parties will be held responsible. Engage in any other form of academic misconduct not covered here. This list is not intended to be exhaustive. To seek clarification, students should ask the professor or the assistant to the instructor for guidance. Reporting Misconduct Faculty Responsibility Faculty and instructors are strongly encouraged to report incidents of student academic misconduct to the academic integrity officer in their school or college in a timely manner so that the incident may be handled fairly and consistently across schools and departments. Assistants to the instructor are expected to report instances of student misconduct to their supervising instructors. Faculty members are expected to respond to student concerns about academic dishonesty in their courses. Student Responsibility If a student observes others violating this policy, the student is strongly encouraged to report the misconduct to the instructor, to seek advice from the academic integrity officer of the school or college that offers the course in question, or to address the student(s) directly.Exam Proctor Responsibility Exam proctors are expected to report incidents of suspected student misconduct to the course instructor and/or the Disability Resource Center, if applicable. Procedure Jurisdiction This policy covers all undergraduate students, regardless of their college of enrollment. Cases will be heard by school-specific committees according to the school in which the class is listed, not the school in which the student is enrolled. All violations and sanctions will be reported to the student's college of enrollment. Administrative Procedures Individual undergraduate colleges and schools may design specific procedures to resolve allegations of academic misconduct by students in courses offered by that school, so long as the procedures are consistent with this policy and with the University Student Conduct Code. Student Rights and Responsibilities in a Hearing A student accused of an academic integrity violation, whether by a professor, assistant to instructor, academic integrity officer or student, is entitled to: Review the written evidence in support of the charge. Ask any questions. Offer an explanation as to what occurred. Present any material that would cast doubt on the correctness of the charge. Determination of the validity of the charge without reference to any past record of misconduct. When responding to a charge of academic misconduct, a student may: Deny the charges and request a hearing in front of the appropriate academic integrity officer or committee. Admit the charges and request a hearing to determine sanction(s). Admit the charges and accept the imposition of sanctions without a hearing. Request a leave of absence from the university. The academic integrity matter must be resolved prior to re- enrollment. Request to withdraw permanently from the university with a transcript notation that there is an unresolved academic integrity matter pending. A student has the following responsibilities in resolving the charge of academic misconduct: Admit or deny the charge. This will determine the course of action to be pursued.Bulletin 2017-18 About Washington University in St. Louis (06/27/17) 12Provide truthful information regarding the charges. It is a University Student Conduct Code violation to provide false information to the university or anyone acting on its behalf. Sanctions If Found Not in Violation of the Academic Integrity Policy If the charges of academic misconduct are not proven, no record of the allegation will appear on the transcript. If Found in Violation of the Academic Integrity Policy If, after a hearing, a student is found to have acted dishonestly, or if a student has admitted to the charges prior to a hearing, the school's academic integrity officer or committee may impose sanctions, including but not limited to the following: Issue a formal written reprimand. Impose educational sanctions, such as completing a workshop on plagiarism or academic ethics. Recommend to the instructor that the student fail the assignment. (A grade is ultimately the prerogative of the instructor.) Recommend to the instructor that the student fail the course. Recommend to the instructor that the student receive a course grade penalty less severe than failure of the course. Place the student on disciplinary probation for a specified period of time or until defined conditions are met. The probation will be noted on the student's transcript and internal record while it is in force. In cases serious enough to warrant suspension or expulsion from the university, refer the matter to the University Student Conduct Board for consideration. Additional educational sanctions may be imposed. This list is not intended to be exhaustive. Withdrawing from the course will not prevent the academic integrity officer or hearing panel from adjudicating the case, imposing sanctions or recommending grade penalties, including a failing grade in the course. A copy of the sanction letter will be placed in the student's academic file. Appeals If a student believes the academic integrity officer or the committee did not conduct a fair hearing, or if a student believes the sanction imposed for misconduct is excessive, they may appeal to the University Student Conduct Board within 14 days of the original decision. Appeals are governed by Section VII C of the University Student Conduct Code.Records Administrative Record-Keeping Responsibilities It is the responsibility of the academic integrity officer in each school to keep accurate, confidential records concerning academic integrity violations. When a student has been found to have acted dishonestly, a letter summarizing the allegation, the outcome and the sanction shall be placed in the student's official file in the office of the school or college in which the student is enrolled. Additionally, each school's academic integrity officer shall make a report of the outcome of every formal accusation of student academic misconduct to the director of Student Conduct and Community Standards, who shall maintain a record of each incident. Multiple Offenses When a student is formally accused of academic misconduct and a hearing is to be held by an academic integrity officer, a committee, or the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards, the person in charge of administering the hearing shall query the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards about the student(s) accused of misconduct. The director shall provide any information in the records concerning that student to the integrity officer. Such information will be used in determining sanctions only if the student is found to have acted dishonestly in the present case. Evidence of past misconduct may not be used to resolve the issue of whether a student has acted dishonestly in a subsequent case. Reports to Faculty and Student Body School and college academic integrity officers are encouraged to make periodic (at least annual) reports to the students and faculty of their school concerning accusations of academic misconduct and the outcomes, without disclosing specific information that would allow identification of the student(s) involved.

Topic Fall 2017: DLA Interdisciplinary Proseminar: This course explores how, over centuries and across national borders, Paris remains central to our sense of Western culture. Our focus on Paris will extend from the 16th century through the present via pairings that join the French capital with other European cities. We will study King Francis I's expansion of the Louvre in Paris in conjunction with the proliferation of castles in the Loire Valley, the court's patronage of Italian artists, and the arrival of Leonardo da Vinci in Amboise. The class will examine the 17th-century court of Versailles as it casts a shadow over Paris, and we will compare the art of the French monarchy during this period with that of Vermeer and his contemporaries in Delft and Amsterdam. WeBulletin 2017-18 University College - Graduate (06/27/17) 16will analyze views of Paris and London the 18th century that show new architectural features and home decor, and we will contrast paintings of Boucher, Fragonard, and Watteau in France with those of Hogarth and Gainsborough in England.

We will explore how these three works share remarkable and intriguing parallels: an inherent belief in evolution; materialism permeated with romanticism; faith in progress; and a similar (\"dialectical\") approach to understanding the dynamics of change, the application of change in all aspects of the natural and social the world. These three works will enable the class to consider aspects of 19th- century intellectual, economic, and social sociopolitical history. No special knowledge of biology, political science, or music is required. Same as U98 MLA 505 Credit 3 units. U96 DLA 607 Humanizing Technology In order to explore the ways that technology had changed the way we read and write, this course examines the myriad ways that technology and the humanities interact in shaping culture and identity in contemporary society. We will study the interactions between the internet and literature, examining the ways that short stories by Jorge Luis Borges and novels like Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson have first shaped the ways that we use and think about the internet. We will investigate new approaches to writing inspired by digital technology with the Bolivian novelist Edmundo Paz Sold\u00e1n's novel Turing's Delirium . The class will consider the development of a technological posthuman identity in society, literature, and films through an analysis of Philip K. Dick's novel Ubik, the film The Matrix , along with the work of cultural theorists Donna Haraway (\"A Cyborg Manifesto\") and Katherine Hayles ( How We Became Posthuman ).

U96 DLA 6117 Popular Culture in Latin America This course examines popular culture in Latin America both as it thrives today and as it has developed historically since the 1800s, when countries achieved their independence. Wewill study different forms of cultural practice, analyzing how they become \"popular\" and how they involve connections between artistic expression, politics, economics, ethnicity, and race. The class will consider differences between \"high culture\" and popular culture; folklore traditions; the impact of of modernization and the dream of \"being modern\"; the role of the media; and the growth of globalized popular culture. Our cultural geography will survey the gauchos (cowboys) of Argentina and Uruguay; national dances such as salsa and reggaeton in the Caribbean; forms of cultural resistance to military rule in Chile; and the pervasive economic, political, and emotional power of soccer (futbol). Students will examine the best-selling novel The Gaucho Juan Moreira and the engaging political essay \"The Open Veins of Latin America,\" stories of urban life, as well as contemporary texts that explore the rise of populism (elites vs. others), dictatorship and social revolution, and the immigrant experience.

Traveling across time and space, from East to West, and into modern cities and uncharted locations, we will explore how writers and filmmakers in the 20th and 21st centuries experiment with innovative forms of artistic expression in response to the growing influence of foreign cultures; technological changes and developments in science; the globalization of world markets; and issues of identity, gender, race, and ethnicity. The class will analyze modernism as a rejection of social and political norms, a crisis of identities, and the fragmentation of life. Works to include Franz Kafka, The Metamorphosis ; James Joyce, Dubliners ; Joseph Conrad, Heart of Darkness ; Amos Tutuola, My Life in the Bush of Ghosts; Italo Calvino, If on a Luis Borges, Fictions; Alejo Carpentier, The Kingdom of This World ; Salman Rushdie, East, West: Stories; and Don DeLillo, The Body Artist , as well as films by Christopher Nolan units. U96 DLA 6310 Mind-Brain and the Arts This course considers ways that recent research in cognitive science might shed light on four traditional topics in the philosophy of the arts. Each topic will focus on a certain type of art (although not exclusively) and on one or more mental faculties: How do pictures represent? How do we understand stories and what roles do they play in the life of the mind? What do we like in the arts and why, according to psychological theories based on brain research? What is style in the arts and can there be a scientific explanation of its history? A parallel concern is with how distinctive features of the arts might shed special light on the nature of the mind. Readings will include essays by prominent art historians, philosophers, psychologists, and scientists. Same as U98 MLA 5310 Credit 3 units. U96 DLA 633 Against the Grain: Transgression and Controversy in Modern Art We examine the public controversies that surround the development of modern art over the last 150 years, to probe the question of the social functions of transgressive art. After reviewing key theories of the avant-garde, we analyze both the persona of the modern artist (Van Gogh, Picasso, Pollock) and the place of women artists in the revolutions of modernism (Bonheur, Cassatt, Kahlo). We next consider modernism's testing of limits in asking what is (and is not) art (Duchamp and Brancusi). We study the most controversial exhibitions (from the First Impressionist Exhibition of 1874 to the Nazi Degenerate Art shows), and the challenges raised by modern artists' treatment of the body and of politics. We end with debates waged over public art in St. Louis, and with recent controversies over public funding of contemporary art. No prior knowledge of art history required.

A&S: TH A&S IQ: HUM EN: H U96 DLA 643 Imagining Germany in the Long Nineteenth Century Between the start of the French Revolution (1789) and the outbreak of the First World War (1914), Germany was transformed from a patchwork of over 300 sovereign territories into a unified nation-state with immense political and economic power. This course examines the crucial role played by literature and the arts in creating a sense of a German national community during this period. Our materials will include national anthems, fairy tales, painting, public monumental art, opera, essays, propaganda, and popular culture, and we will investigate these materials with an eye toward the different and sometimes opposing visions of the nation and national character to which they give expression. Within this broader context, we will address the perceived contribution of men, women, and the family to the project of nation building; the role of language, of national heroes and legends, and of geography in creating a sense of unity; and the ways in which national identity is defined in opposition to a perceived Other (in this case, France). We will also consider Zionism as an offshoot of the Europeannationalisms and a response to anti-Semitism in Germany. Works studied include fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm; essays and poems by Johann Wolfgang Goethe, Heinrich von Kleist, and Berthold Auerbach; Germany, A Winter's Tale by Heinrich Heine; The Patrioteer by Heinrich Mann; and The Jewish State by Theodor Herzl. Credit 3 units. U96 DLA 6430 Pilgrims and Seekers: American Spirituality from Transcendentalism to the New Age The seminar focuses on the formation of \"spirituality\" in American culture from the transcendentalist world of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Walt Whitman on through more recent expressions of the \"spiritual-but-not-religious\" sensibility. For the purposes of this course, \"spirituality\" is usefully placed in quotation marks in order to emphasize its peculiar construction as something positively distinct from \"religion\" \u2014 a re-ordering of American religious thought and experience that we will explore in historical and contemporaneous terms. The social and political consequences of this turn to the spiritual over the religious will also be explored: for example, the consecration of liberal individualism, the environmental vision of nature mysticism, the blessing of a \"bourgeois-bohemian\" consumerism, and the negotiation of cultural pluralism. Same as L57 RelPol 430 Credit 3 units. A&S: TH EN: H U96 DLA 645 Global Cinema: A Love Story Focusing on the ubiquity of love stories in cinema, this seminar will explore connections between romance, anxieties, and aspirations in contemporary society. Studying celebrated films from the United States ( When Harry Met Sally, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ), Latin America (Love in the Time of Hysteria ), Europe ( Amelie, Caf\u00e9 au Lait ), Lunchbox ), and East Asia ( 2046, Happy Together), among others, we will consider how love functions as a symptom of what ails society. The class will examine not only personal relationships but also social structures, economic systems, and political conflicts. Topics will cover issues of class, gender, and race; the construction of economic identities; and the formal structures and aesthetics of film. Students will be required to watch two films per week as well as to complete selected short readings. Same as U98 MLA 5450 Credit 3 units. U96 DLA 6451 Introduction to American Culture Studies An introduction to interdisciplinary approaches to the study of American culture. The class will examine the relationship between cultural criticism and scholarship on American culture, the history of the American studies and cultural studies movements, the simultaneous turn to \"historicist\" approaches in literary studies and to \"textualist\" approaches to historical studies, the moral and interpretive implications of the shift from a modernist to a postmodernist stance in cultural inquiry, and the challenges that multiculturalist and transnational perspectives pose to the study of a national American culture. Many of the readings will emphasize trends in cultural history, but will also include works in anthropology, art and architectural history, literary history, media studies, political and social theory, and religious studies. Same as L98 AMCS 645 Credit 4 units.Bulletin 2017-18 University College - Graduate (06/27/17) 18U96 DLA 6464 Medicine and Morality in Global Perspective What does it mean to be sick? What does it mean to be a patient, or a healer? Is it possible to imagine a universal morality in which our understanding of medical ethics is shared among peoples worldwide? What are some of the ethical dilemmas associated with genetic testing, organ transplants, and global disparities in health? Framed by these questions, our class will examine how culture shapes our concepts of disease and our expectations for treatment. Similarly, we will consider how social class, race, and ethnicity influence both health and access to health care worldwide. Our readings will focus on medical history and the evolution of diagnosis and treatment of disease; health disparities; the varying relations of patients and healers in different cultures; African health crises; public health controversies; folk illness in Latin America; medical technologies and ethical conflicts; and other issues of medical anthropology pertaining to the prevention and treatment of illness and the healing process around the globe. We will also discuss three documentaries: Frontline: Sickness Around the World; Donka: X-Ray of an African Hospital (Doctors Without Borders); and Dan Rather Reports: Kidney Pirates (with anthropologist Nancy Scheper-Hughes). Same as U98 MLA 5454 Credit 3 units. U96 DLA 665 From Mikado to Makudo: A Literary View of Japan This course will survey Japan's social and cultural history through selected literary works that span the seventh century (Mikado) to the present day (Makudo). Our readings \u2014 including fiction, poetry, drama, and personal writings \u2014 will serve as guides to key historical epochs: the aristocratic culture of the Heian era ( Tale of Genji ), the warrior society of the medieval era (Tale of the Heike ), and the Tanizaki, Mishima, and Oe will expose the complexities of modern Japan. Students will gain an appreciation of Japan's unique heritage, social complexity, and place in East Asia and the world today. Same as U98 MLA 5565 Credit 3 units. UColl: NW U96 DLA 667 Translating Worlds This course studies different forms of cultural translation, that is, the communication of knowledge, behavior, and language from one culture to another. We will examine how an author reworks earlier and foreign traditions, adapting ideas and practices for which there may be no direct equivalent in the author's own culture. In the new cultural setting, do the roles of men and women shift? Do questions of ethnicity, class, religion, and sexuality become more pronounced, or do they fade away? These questions will frame our study of historic cultural encounters, colonialism, exile, and other processes that shape modernity. Students will explore two dramatic points of cultural intersection: Tolkien's modern reworking of Sir Orfeo, a medieval version of the classical myth of the musician Orpheus and his wife Eurydice; and Goethe's Italian Journey, the journal of the German writer's experiences with the people, art, and history that he encountered during his travels. We will see how diaspora and migration shape perceptions in works by Alejo Carpentier ( The Kingdom of this and Jhumpa Lahiri ( Interpreter of Maladies ). The class will also learn how different scholarly and artistic fields address the concept of cultural translation, including cultural anthropology (James Clifford), film adaptation (Louis Malle's Vanya on 42nd Street, inspired by Chekhov's play), and colonial history (VicenteRafael). In addition, we will discuss how digital technology affects cultural translation today (Google Translate, and projects using geographic information system [GIS] technology). Students will consider challenges facing the humanities and the sciences as these technologies advance. Will it be possible to make all knowledge, and all culturally-specific information, universally accessible? No foreign language experience required. Same as U98 MLA 567 Credit 3 units. U96 DLA 671 The Making of the Modern Catholic Church This course will look at three church councils that put their stamp on the Catholic Church at key moments in its history, making it what it is today. The first section will be dedicated to the Fourth Lateran Council (1215), which defined the high medieval church as an all-encompassing papal monarchy with broad powers over the lives of all Europeans Christian and non-Christian alike. In the second section, we will turn our attention to the Council of Trent (1545-1563), which responded to the threat posed by the Protestant Reformation by reforming the Catholic church, improving clerical education, tightening ecclesiastical discipline, and defining and defending Catholic doctrine. We will conclude with a consideration of the largest church council ever, Vatican II (1962-1965), which reformed the liturgy and redefined the church to meet the challenges of the modern, multicultural, post-colonial world. Same as U98 MLA 5701 Credit 3 units. U96 DLA 672 Genre Cinema: The Art of Variation This seminar explores the role of genre as a powerful means of mainstream cinema to tell compelling stories and structure the viewer's identification. Even though genres such as the melodrama, the western, the romantic comedy, the musical, the science fiction film, the horror film, or the thriller are often seen as quite predictable staples of dominant filmmaking, they also inspire and allow for considerable formal experimentation and thematic departure. This seminar examines the logic of some of the most important genres of Hollywood filmmaking while at the same time emphasizing the creative possibilities of working with certain genre expectations. We discuss such classic representatives of certain genres as Imitation of Life , Stagecoach , His Girl Friday , The Day the Earth Stood Still , 42nd Street , and North By Northwest , and then juxtapose these paradigmatic examples with more contemporary films reworking or pushing the limits of the classical genre system such as Far from Heaven , Lone Star , Blade Runner, Dancer in the Dark , and Breathless .

American Culture Studies The Master of Arts in American Culture Studies addresses the intellectual and moral questions of American identity and belonging that no single disciplinary perspective can comprehensively and satisfyingly resolve. What does it mean to live and work in an American culture devoted to individual success and autonomy and at the same time be a citizen of a nation devoted to collective needs and well-being? The Master of Arts in American Culture Studies provides the instruction , both in specific disciplines and in cross-disciplinary conversations, to help students answer important questions about American society. It also introduces some of the social, political, and cultural issues that have shaped American culture and identity. Most fundamentally, it provides a critical skill set that fosters analysis of an array of cultural objects \u2014 a place,an event, a work of art, a political institution \u2014 from a rich and diverse foundation of knowledge and perspectives. Students' studies culminate in a self-directed project that allows them to explore an area of personal interest while participating in a multidisciplinary scholarly community. Part of the excitement of this kind of learning is the opportunity to engage in creative, rigorous exchange with the faculty in the humanities and social sciences at Washington University in St. Louis, and with leading practitioners in the St. Louis professional and policy world.

U89 AMCS 412 Sports and Culture: Reading Race and Racism through Spectator Sports This course will examine the role of spectator sports in American life, seeking to understand the way athletics have influenced the politics and discourse of the United States and its citizens. In particular, we will consider the prominent role sports have played in affecting the way Americans understand race and racism. We will focus on athletes of significance since the Civil War, including Isaac Burns Murphy, Jack Johnson, Jesse Owens, Jackie Robinson, Muhammad Ali, Michael Jordan, and others. At the same time, we will examine how media shapes our understanding of athletes and the competitions we consume. Credit 3 units. UColl: ACH, ACSBulletin 2017-18 University College - Graduate (06/27/17) 20U89 AMCS 413 Writing the Documentary Lyric This course explores American culture through poetic accounts that focus on the personal experience of social issues ranging from ecological crisis, consumer culture, race, labor, war, and autobiography as coextensive with local history. Students will blend research with creative writing, reading exemplary texts (such as Birdlovers, Backyard ; Giscombe Road ; Citizen; Port of Los Angeles ; Shut Up, Shut Down ; and 100 Notes on Violence ) while producing their own creative work. The readings and writings will be focused on documentary writing which incorporates quotations from daily life, the news, films, diaries, public documents, and maps. The readings studied are \"lyric\" instead of journalistic, following a poetic approach that connects inner experience and outer event, intimate and distant occurrences, people and places, private and public life. Students will engage in weekly creative-writing exercises while developing a final research-based creative-writing project. The course will include conversations with some of our books' authors, who will offer insights into their processes of cultural research grounded in personal experience and language-conscious cultural critique. This course will count toward the major in American culture studies for day students. This course fulfills the Art distribution requirement for the AMCS MA program. Credit 3 units. UColl: ACF U89 AMCS 4135 Tobacco: History, Anthropology, and Politics of a Global Epidemic Tobacco is the most important public health and medical problem of our time, the leading cause of cancer and other chronic diseases. This course examines tobacco's important role in shaping the modern world and global health over the course of the last five centuries, from indigenous uses of tobacco to plantation slavery to the cigarette boom to the politics of health and smoking in the 21st century. Through in-depth historical and anthropological case studies, tobacco provides a window into trends in government and law, medicine and public health, business and economics, society and culture, including changing social meanings of gender, race, class, sexuality, advertising, consumerism, risk, responsibility, and health in the United States and worldwide. This course also introduces students to public health approaches to noncommunicable disease prevention, environmental health, and healthy lifestyle promotion. No background in anthropology or public health is required. Same as L48 Anthro 4135 History of American Architecture \"The perennial architectural debate has always been, and will continue to be, about art versus use, visions versus pragmatism, aesthetics versus social responsibility. In the end, these unavoidable conflicts provide architecture's essential and productive tensions; the tragedy is that so little of it rises above the level imposed by compromise, and that this is the only work most of us see and know.\" \u2014Ada Louise Huxtable. This course examines the ideological, political, economic and social determinants that have shaped the look of American architecture. Starting with a thorough survey of the historic development of American architecture pursued in a chronological reading of styles, forms, and major architects, the course examines key tensions in the development of American architecture. Students will undertake readings, site visits, and discussions that probe whether there is a distinctly American mode of creating architecture, and what contingencies illuminate or obscure that mode. The central questions of this course: What are the definitive characteristics of American architecture?Does the American practice of architecture espouse an exceptionalism, or does it emulate international precedents (or both)? Do the characteristics of American architecture reveal the social, economic, and political structures of its production? Ultimately, can we read an American building to reveal sense of national identity, individual political agency, the evolution of gender roles, the assertion of disciplinary and economic power, and the evolution of the American artistic sensibility? This course fulfills the Humanities and Fine Arts distribution requirement for the AMCS master's program. Credit 3 units. UColl: ACF, ACH U89 AMCS 4220 The Presidency and American Political Culture This course seeks to analyze the ways in which the President of the United States is not only a political, but a symbolic head of the nation. This process of constructing the nation is mutually constitutive, in which the president works to construct the nation by rhetorically and materially uniting it, and the people construct the presidency, both in the powers they confer upon it and the ways in which they imagine its significance. Along with more traditional definitions of political power, this course will examine the presidential use of power through rhetoric and self-portrayal in such forms as portraiture and campaigns. Also included are the people's depictions of the presidency, such as photography, monumental architecture, and popular films. The specific case studies of presidential administrations include James Madison, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, Ronald Reagan, and Barack Obama. Credit 3 units. UColl: ACH U89 AMCS 4281 Race and Science in America, 1840-2000 This course will examine a variety of theories of racial differences based on scientific (biological) theories, from the early days of anthropometry (measurements of facial angle or cranial capacity) to criminal anthropology, eugenic theories of the early 1900s, the race and I.Q. and sociobiology claims about race in the 1970s, The Bell Curve and theories of J. Philippe Rushton in the 1990s. Readings will be drawn from primary sources, including the writings of Samuel George Morton, Joshia Nott,Cesare Lombroso, Charles B. Davenport, Madison Grant, Arthur R. Jensen, and E.O. Wilson; and from secondary sources such as Stephen Jay Gould's, The Mismesure of Man. Course format will be some lecture but mostly discussion and student presentations.

In addition to a review of the structural and pragmatic aspects of Black speech, the course highlights relationships between controversies within the linguistic community, contrasting views of speech within BlackBulletin 2017-18 University College - Graduate (06/27/17) 21lay communities, public discourse, and educational policy. Students will also conduct a field-based research project in accord with their particular interests. Same as L12 Educ 4315 Credit 3 the American Cultural Imagination This multidisciplinary course examines how representations of illness in America reveal a culture that is always negotiating philosophical, ethical, and political questions about the body and disease. We will study a range of texts \u2014 medical articles, religious treatises, films, and history of public health \u2014 with a particular emphasis on fiction. Students will be asked to consider the distinction scholar Arthur Kleinman makes between illness and disease \u2014 illness as the patient's experience and disease as medicine's focus \u2014 in order to negotiate the subjective experience of illness and the biological reality of disease. We will explore how we understand illness through our metaphorical descriptions of it, our characterizations of those who contract it, and our visions of who/what cures it. Readings will demonstrate shifts in both popular and medical views of illness as we think about how different historical periods are marked by a preoccupation with specific diseases: small-pox, yellow fever, cholera, tuberculosis, polio, cancer, AIDs, etc. This course fulfills the Humanities and Social Science distribution requirement for the AMCS MA program.

Writers include Dion Boucicault, William Wells Brown, Marita Bonner, Lorraine Hansberry, and August Wilson Same as U65 ELit 403 Credit 3 units. U89 AMCS 444 American Conspiracy This course will trace the prevalence and power of modern conspiracy theories in American culture that have their roots in the birth of the republic and continue to flourish today. We will analyze the specificity of conspiracy theories \u2014 UFOs, Communists, the Moon landing, JFK's assassination, AIDS and the CIA, 9/11 Truthers \u2014 but our purpose will be to \"theorize\" the conspiracy theory. How do Americans perceive and misperceive their culture, and for what ends? Much of our work will be methodological insofar as distrust and paranoia are produced in many realms \u2014 psychological, social, political \u2014 and we must organize and analyze these overlapping anxieties in our practice of American culture studies. This course fulfills the Humanities distribution requirement for the AMCS MA program. Credit 3 units. UColl: ACH U89 AMCS 445 Introduction to American Culture Studies This course will introduce students to the history and methods of the interdisciplinary field of American studies. Questions wewill ask throughout the semester include: How do we define \"culture,\" and how has that definition changed over time? What are the social, intellectual, and political stakes of how we define culture and the ways we study it? Throughout the semester, students will have the opportunity to read published work by AMCS-affiliated faculty, who will join the class to discuss their work and the practice of American studies. While the course will use AMCS's four program initiatives \u2014 American Intimacies, Modern Segregation, Visual and Material Culture, and Performance and Pop Culture \u2014 as a means to consider the range of analytical methods commonly utilized by American studies scholars, the course will be useful to students in other fields interested learning more about social and cultural history and/or cultural studies.

The emphasis in this course is on how these concepts are constructed in urban educational institutions. The course includes a field component that involves local elementary and/or middle schools. Same as L90 AFAS 4511 Credit 3 The Politics of Immigration: The United States and the World We will study immigrant populations and the politics of migration, focusing on the social, economic, and political status of immigrant groups in the United States in the comparative context of global trends. In the 1990s, redefinitions of national boundaries and the dislocation of many cultural and political groups catalyzed new waves of immigration around the world. U.S. economic strength at this time attracted many of these migrants to this country. The new millenium has witnessed significant shifts in global migration patterns. We will evaluate national factors such as immigration laws, housing, education, and economic policies, as well the impact of international forces such as war and economic globalization.

Art: HUM U89 AMCS 465 Studies in American Cultural Identity: Beginnings to the Civil War An exploration of early American literary, visual, and musical art in relation to key themes, decisive moments, and cultural developments which have shaped our national character and influenced our first internationally recognized artists, as the formation of a distinctly American art begins. Struggles for religious, racial, and gender rights, American violence, polarities of innocence and experience, individualism and conformity, The American Dream and its dreamers, all receive attention. Viewing of American Neoclassical and Romantic visual art and architecture, listening to colonial, Federalist, Jacksonian and post-Jacksonian era songs and ballads, and reading from major and less well-known 17th-, 18th-, and 19th-century literary and historical figures.

UColl: ACF, ACH U89 AMCS 474 Studies in American Cultural Identity: The Civil War to the Jazz Age The course is an exploration of later 19th- to early 20th-century American literary, visual, and musical art in relation to key themes, decisive moments, and cultural developments which have shaped and defined our national character. Struggles for religious, racial, and gender rights; American violence; our polarities of innocence and experience, of individual and group welfare, individualism and conformity; and complex expressions of The American Dream and its dreamers, all receive attention. We view American Post-Romantic, Realistic, Naturalistic, and Post-World War I visual art, architecture, and photography; listen to late 19th-century, turn of the century, and Jazz Age music; and read from major and less well-known literary figures to consider how the social and political developments of the time influenced our artists as the flourishing of a distinctly American art became an internationally acknowledged fact.

UColl: ACF, ACH U89 475D Landscapes Through Time: The History of St. Louis' Built Environment From the Mississippian mound builders to the urban conditions of the present day, this course will investigate the different approaches of various cultures to creating built environments that meet the needs of their time in terms of landscapes and structures. Using the City of St. Louis and particularly its riverfront district as an example, the course will examine the layout and infrastructure of the city at various periods, discussing the effects of technological changes in the creation of structures, improvements to transportation and sanitation, facilitation of trade and the effects of these forces on the cultural and built landscape of the city. We cover the structures andlandscapes that defined individual eras in the history of the city, and the ways in which these were successful or unsuccessful. Further, the course investigates the cultural needs, whims and desires that dictated certain types of structures and landscapes for civic, recreational, commercial, residential and religious purposes. Students will be expected to make a short 15-20 minute presentation to the class on a local structure, based on a personal field trip to the site, during the course of the semester. Credit 3 units.

U89 AMCS 478A American Folklore in Context For the last several election cycles, candidates and supporters from across the political spectrum have invoked \"the real American.\" But what does it mean to be authentically American? A simple answer might be that they are \"us.\" A more complex one requires that we dive into American folklore. The scholarly field of Folklore may be defined loosely as exploring what we say, what we do, and what we believe. Following this schema, this course will probe the question of what it means to be \"American folk\" by examining how folklore informs and shapes the world around us and our everyday lives. More particularly, we ask how race and ethnicity, class and gender are encoded and contested through folk expression. Beginning with the question \"who are the folk,\" we will look at classic and contemporary texts in folklore studies to explore how our food, our stories, our daily rituals, and our music, to name a few, interweave to create a complex, multilayered, and uniquely American folk. Readings pair specific genres with different theoretical approaches and include our jokes, urban legends, folktales, foodways, music, and material culture. Crucially, we seek to trouble popular notions of folklore as \"antiquities\" to question how the lens of Folklore studies may reveal how American culture not only consists of folklore but is constructed by it as folk forms are deployed in contemporary contexts, from Slenderman to Snopes to modern slave auctions. The course will entail several small collection projects to give students an understanding of the work a folklorist does in the field and how folklore is coproduced within a community, and a longer research project. This course satisfies the Humanities requirement for the master's program in American Culture Studies. Credit 3 units. UColl: ACHBulletin 2017-18 University College - Graduate (06/27/17) 23U89 AMCS 480 Women's Health Care in America This course will provide a broad historical overview of women's health care in America. We will begin with an examination of midwifery in 18th-century America, then look at the increasing medicalization of childbirth and the new emphasis on women's biological difference in the 19th century, and finally study changes in the medical profession and their impact on women's health care in the early to mid-20th century. Through a wide range of material \u2014 including primary texts, such as doctor-authored tracts, diaries, letters, and fiction, as well as secondary material written by historians, feminist scholars, and medical writers \u2014 we will trace the changing perceptions and conceptions of women's bodies and health. Authors will include: Catherine Maria Sedgwick, Nathanial Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, Dr. Mary Putnam Jacobi, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Louisa May Alcott, Joan Jacobs Brumberg, and Natalie Angier. Credit 3 units. U89 AMCS 482 And Justice for All? American Inequalities In this course we examine social inequality in the contemporary United States, with a particular focus on disparities related to health, wealth, housing and neighborhoods, criminal justice, and education. The St. Louis metropolitan region will serve as a guiding case study, tying together the course themes with a common example of how inequality shapes material and political life. We will investigate the current empirical reality and historical roots of American inequality, the key theories and methodological tools used to examine and explain inequality, the institutions responsible for its reproduction, and possibilities for reducing inequality via social policy and social movement. Within each topic area, we will pay special attention to the significance of race and ethnicity, social class, and gender \u2014 as well as their intersections and cleavages. We will largely constrain our inspection of inequality to American metropolitan areas as we analyze the spatial or place-based effects associated with disparities in urban America. Readings are drawn from sociology, urban history, geography, political science, economics, social epidemiology, and education. Credit 3 units. U89 AMCS 483 Race and Real Estate in St. Louis 1869 - Present This course analyzes how real estate continues to influence the racial history of St. Louis, focusing on the laws, policies, and practices that have shaped and hardened racial divides in this city. While race-based policy in St. Louis has resulted in a sharp black/white divide, these legal instruments of exclusion were developed in tandem with an increasingly robust taxonomy of racial classifications across the globe. Thus, the course is focused on one city and its unique racial dynamics, but we will also put St. Louis history in the context of the history of ethnology and the rise of racial science. We will conduct primary- source research in the St. Louis city and county archives, the Missouri History Museum Library, and the office of the recorder of deeds. We also will read about St. Louis' unique history of 19th-century privatized urban infrastructure, the city's industrial boom and post-industrial bust, suburbanization, urban decline, and gentrification in the 21st century. We will conduct research on specific parcels of property in the city, tracing not only the residents of the property, but also the chain of ownership. Credit 3 units. UColl: ACSU89 AMCS 4881 Conservatism and the American Right in the United States This course focuses on the post-World War II conservative movement, one of the most important and successful political movements of the 20th century. The class will consider the history and definition of the \"Right\" and \"conservatism\" in the modern Western thought; trace the origins of the American Right in the reaction against a modernizing, consumer- driven American culture; assess the rise of a self-consciously intellectual conservative movement after World War II and the ways in which activists guided and manipulated the broader American Right; examine the various strands of the conservative movement, from free-market libertarianism to anti-Communism to traditionalist antimodernism; explore the way in which conservatives gained control of the Republican Party and toppled the liberal establishment; explore the rise of the New Right (including populist social conservatism and politicized evangelical Christianity) and of neoconservatism in the 1970s; and, finally, analyze the subsequent splintering of the conservative coalition.

U89 AMCS 491 \"St. Louis Got the Best of Me\": Music in American Culture This course will explore how music functions as a folklore, centering on the many musical styles, musicians, and fans that have shaped St. Louis from the early ragtime to today's diverse music scene. The term \"folk music\" may bring images of banjos and accordians, but every kind of music has a \"folk\" \u2014 folk who use music to represent their identities, their beliefs, and their struggles. Throughout the semester, students will question what \"American\" music sounds like, and what happens to music and culture as it is played, recorded, and represented. St. Louis provides us with a hothouse of musical cultures, incubating the blues and Jeff Tweedy, encouraging ethnic traditions from Ireland to Bosnia and beyond, providing a haven for fans like the Juggalos and a nationally renowned superfan, and fostering a homegrown fiddling style all our own. The course will use St. Louis' music culture \u2014 with lots of listening \u2014 to examine what music means to both ingroup and outgroup musicians and listeners but also the roles music plays in an ongoing dialogue about authenticity, traditionality, and appropriation between the individual, the community, and the larger society.

U89 AMCS 492 Decoding the City While architecture and infrastructure are worthy of study in themselves, often they signify more complex cultural meanings,Bulletin 2017-18 University College - Graduate (06/27/17) 24mask efforts to erase or reorder the city, and conceal histories of injustice. This course presents methods for \"reading\" the built form of the American city to decode histories of architecture, culture, public policy and economics. City space can be read literally, but this course will unpack the symbolic meanings of urban spaces, neighborhoods, buildings and sites. Students will undertake readings that will present methods for understanding and analyzing the city's form, before delving into a specific case study of the Mill Creek Valley. As St. Louis' largest African-American neighborhood, but almost completely erased between 1959 and 1965 using city and federal funds, the site of the neighborhood remains a potent and under-examined part of St. Louis. The course will examine the history of the neighborhood as well as related histories of federal and local urban renewal policies, African-American cultural history and historic preservation. Research into the neighborhood will include experiences at local archives where students will learn to attain and apply primary source documents vital to urban history including Census records, building permits, municipal ordinances and insurance maps. Additional readings will offer insights into possible methods for interpreting and commemorating places that illuminate the urban built environment's historic past. The final project in this course will entail students collaboratively working on a public interpretive project for Mill Creek Valley where they can apply both methods of decoding and curating the city. This course satisfies the Humanities and Social Science requirement for the master's program in American Culture Studies. Credit 3 units.

This history and creative-writing course explores the contexts and expressions of 20th century and contemporary protest movements, ranging from labor, civil rights, the Vietnam War, ethnic people and women's movements, to contemporary social and environmental justice movements. We will explore speeches, manifestos, visual and oral texts, songs, and poetry to consider how dissent is voiced in response to specific social contexts and historic events. We will consider the role of personal expression in enacting democracy, focusing on poetry that helps articulate what is at stake in the protest movements of the 20th and 21st centuries. We will examine how language moves people, raising awareness of the facts and felt experiences of injustice, helping to fuel social movements and \"call forth a public\" to make change. Assignments include a mix of historical analysis, ethnographic and participatory work, creative writing, and reflection.

These forms include the American House, Workplace, The Street, Civic Spaces, and Shapes of the Land such as the National Park System. The course combines readings, lectures, audio-visual presentations, field trips, and class discussions to explore such \"growths out of our past\" in their historic and cultural contexts. This course will enable students to better understand the relationship between American culture and how we have shaped our landscape. Their new understanding should help students to better interpret the many layers of the American landscape as well as help communities thoughtfully design a more sustainable, meaningful future that grows gracefully out of its past.

U89 AMCS 5135 American Social Character: Individualism and Community An exploration of the American social character from its earliest beginnings to the present day. The class will seek the sources of American values, and the political, economic and social forces that have changed these values over the centuries with an emphasis on the conflict between individualism and the need for community. Readings begin with two key sources of American values from British political thought: Hobbes and Locke. Tocqueville will then teach us about the American social character in the 1830s, a set of values that is still with us but under attack in the present day. We will see these values expressed in practical terms by Emerson, Thoreau, Lincoln and Martin Luther King. Henry Adams will give us a picture of the corruption of America's earlier values in the period after the Civil War. We will also read from three analytical works on changes in American social character. Same as U98 MLA 5135 Credit 3 units. U89 AMCS 515 Discovering the Heartland The central regions of the United States, most especially the prairies, were slow to find their place in America's sense of itself. Called the \"Great American Desert\" on many early 19th-century maps, the interior grassland \u2014 with time and cultivation \u2014 proved able to feed a vast nation. What travelers dismissed as a \"waste\" and described as a kind of inland sea separating east from west came to epitomize America, became its heartland. This course will examine literary, political, and historical texts that mark our passage through this transition of thought and place. Readings will include exploration narratives, scientific reports, political speeches, and historical commentary (as well as, of course, novels and poems). Credit 3 units.

U89 AMCS 5217 Paint It Black: Understanding American Film Noir A product of highly diverse influences and traditions, film noir is known for its stylized visual aesthetic, crackling dialogue, moral ambivalence, and existential paranoia. Its style and language continue to inform filmmakers in Hollywood and worldwide. This seminar positions the aesthetic shapes and traumatic narratives of film noir within the context of American culture and film history during the war and post-war years. As importantly, it explores film noir as a test case in order to probe notions of film history, genre, and authorship, of cultural and intermedial transfer and the popular. Required screenings will take place during the second half of each week's class. Films will likely include many of the following: The Maltese Falcon , Phantom Lady , Double Indemnity , Laura, Gun Crazy , Somewhere in the Night , The Glass Key , The Blue Gardenia and Chinatown.

UColl: ACF U89 AMCS 5222 The Dysfunctional Family in American Drama One can say without fear of exaggeration that American drama is family drama. In countless plays from O'Neill to Tennessee Williams to Wendy Wasserstein and Sam Shepard, the family and its complex series of love-hate relations has been seen by our best playwrights as a microcosm of America itself, and its dreams and illusions. This course will examine the theme of family relations on the American stage from 1920 to the present day. Along with a close study of individual plays we will also research the psychological and social underpinnings of the family in America, asking ourselves about its meanings, myths and functions. Plays include: O'Neill, A Long Day's Journey into Night ; Williams, The Glass Menagerie; Miller, Death of a Salesman ; Albee, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? ; Hansberry, A Raisin in the Sun ; Fierstein, The Torch Song Trilogy; Norman, 'night Mother ; Wasserstein, The Sisters Rosensweig ; and Shepard, Buried Child . A large number of these plays haveBulletin 2017-18 University College - Graduate (06/27/17) 26been made into films, and we will take advantage of these to supplement our analyses of the playscripts. Same as U98 MLA 5223 Credit 3 units. U89 AMCS 5223 Film Stardom, Performance and Fan Culture This course focuses on the Hollywood star system. We will explore stars in relation to celebrity and consumerism, especially how \"stardom\" is created by a system that seeks to create effects in film viewers whether conceived as audiences, fans, or spectators. We will examine the performance element of stardom and its relationship to genre, style, and changing film technology. Also of concern will be how stars and the discursive construction of stardom intersect with gender representation, race, ideology, sexuality, age, disability, nationality, and other points of theoretical interest to and historical inquiry in contemporary film studies. While emphasis will be placed on mainstream commercial U.S. cinema, students are encouraged to pursue questions beyond this framework within their own research. Required screenings.

How does it resonate and influence our politics, advertising, and especially the arts? We will discuss the experience of immigration and assimilation, how foreigners with different cultural backgrounds enter American society. Beginning with the implications of America's image as a \"brave new world\" in European thought and philosophy (including Shakespeare's The Tempest ), and the prescient view of our culture by de Tocqueville and others, we will examine how the dream of success and wealth has been depicted and employed in theater, fiction, cinema, and the visual arts. Texts include: Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby , Williams's West's Day of the Locust , Lorraine Hansberry's the Zoo Story\" and \"The American Dream,\" and John Guare's The House of Blue Leaves. We will consider modern painters whose work offers a commentary on the dream, such as Edward Hopper and Andy Warhol.

U89 AMCS 5291 St. Louis in the 1870s: from Revolution to Reaction: Social, Political, and Economic Change The decade of the 1870s can be seen as one which began with great promise, a kind of \"revolution\" stemming from the victory of the Federal government in the Civil War and the hopes many had for further social reforms in a newly reunited America. But divisions were too strong, and growing stronger in the 1870s, between capital and labor, black and white, an optimistic electorate and a corrupt political system. The end of the decade heralded a new era of reaction, during which corruption flourished, the rich got richer, the poor got poorer, and the civil rights of African Americans and Native Americans reached a nadir. It was not until the middle of the 20th century that these conditions began once more to improve. During the decade, St. Louis went through several crucial changes involving education, transportation routes to and from the city, commerce,Bulletin 2017-18 University College - Graduate (06/27/17) 27the rights of labor, progressive legislation, civic improvements, and political corruption. This course will chart these changes by approaching the decade year by year, focusing on a major local event with national repercussions that took place during each year from 1870 to 1879. Other local events will also be included in readings and discussions, including the creation of local parks (Tower Grove and Forest Park), a professional baseball team, philosophical thought in the community, and the local arts scene (drama, literature, graphic arts). Most of the readings will be from periodical publications, or excerpts from books, since no one book covers the period in any detail. The readings will be available on e-reserve. There will also be an emphasis on the use of primary sources, which are rich, particularly newspaper accounts. References to existing landmarks and historic sites for each week's major story will provide a sense of place and extend our studies into the community at large. Credit 3 units.

U89 AMCS 5310 A History of Freedom of Speech in the United States Freedom of speech and the press are among the most esteemed and contested principles in American governance. Through a close study of some of the best historical scholarship on the topic, we will consider the evolution of free speech philosophy, law, and practice from the colonial years through the 20th century. We will focus predominately on the shifting boundaries of political speech and the press, and explore the impact and interplay of federal and state law; judges and legal culture; extralegal organizations and the public in setting those boundaries. We will examine several seminal legal cases and ponder the historical context and forces which contributed to high court legal opinions. We will reflect on whether there has been progress in free speech doctrine and practice, and what, if anything, Americans have contributed to a broader European philosophy and tradition of free speech.

U89 AMCS 538 Art and St. Louis History From the first painting loaned to the Mercantile Library in 1846 to the formation of the City Art Museum (now the Saint Louis Art Museum) in 1909, art patronage in St. Louis was tied to the growth and development of the city's merchant class. These businessmen-collectors recognized art's potential as a tool for civic advancement and actively employed it at a variety of venues. This course introduces significant individuals in St. Louis as well as artists popular at this time and explores the growth of area cultural institutions within the context of social history. Credit 3 units. U89 AMCS 539 Topics in American Politics: American Urban Politics and History This course focuses on the historical and cultural environment of cities from a political perspective. American urban areas are a cauldron of decision-making and power relationships which determine not only the shape of the physical spaces within cities, but also the allocation of resources. Topics include racial discrimination through historical and current national and localpolicies such as \"blockbusting\" or \"redlining\"; how economic development and redevelopment reshaped and continues to reshape the physical environment of cities and the political relationships within cities in the post World War II era; and the uses and meanings of urban public schools.

UColl: ACF, ACH, ACS U89 AMCS 547 Violence and Nonviolence in American Culture In this course we will look at the role of violence and nonviolence in American culture, asking ourselves whether it is possible to determine which of the two is the more powerful and effective force. We will examine some aspects of the philosophy of violence and nonviolence, using the works of Hannah Arendt, Martin Luther King, and possibly Ren\u00e9 Girard and others. We will undertake a historical analysis of the (often overlooked)Bulletin 2017-18 University College - Graduate (06/27/17) 28role of nonviolent tactics in winning American wars from the Revolutionary War through the present war on terror. We will examine some aspects of social violence in contemporary American culture, including the school shootings at Columbine High School, and others, in order to determine the similarities and differences between social and political violence. We will look at the effectiveness of nonviolent social protest, including the civil rights movement and past and present peace movements. Credit 3 units. U89 AMCS 548 Wanderlust: An Exploration of Travel in American Culture Long before the advent of the supersonic jet and Expedia.com, Americans were driven to wander by an all-consuming passion for travel. Pilgrimage and discovery narratives were widely popular in the 19th century, and contributed to the ideal of America as a mobile and self-determined society, while souvenir- hunting and grand touring became fashionable pastimes of a growing middle class. Many of our own ideas about travel \u2014 and indeed, much of its allure \u2014 can be traced back to earlier periods and practices, images and ideas. In this course, we will explore travel in American culture during the 19th and 20th centuries, focusing on the rich visual, print, and material culture associated with the traveler and traveling (guidebooks, travel narratives, advertisements, photos, paintings, souvenirs, etc.). Our exploration will take us far and wide, from popular tourist destinations (Niagara Falls and the Catskills) to what once seemed far-flung destinations (Brazil, Japan, the Middle East, and Hawaii) to a World's Fair to our own backyards. Our approach will be multidisciplinary and hands-on, as we seek to understand American wanderlust through the study of cultural artifacts. Credit 3 units. U89 AMCS 550 Politics and Film Examination of the role of film in 20th-century American political culture. The class will view eight films that reflect prominent political themes or issues such as the Cold War (Dr. Strangelove ), corruption ( All the President's Men ), and electoral strategies ( The Candidate ), and discuss their relationship to the American political culture of the time. Students will be responsible for classroom discussion and several short papers.

U89 AMCS 554 \"By the Sweat of Your Brow\": A History of Work in America This course traces the history of the most mundane and near- universal of human activities: work. It argues that work has a history: that who worked, what counted as work, and how work was represented in popular culture changed dramatically over the 19th and 20th centuries. We will look at the varied nature of work in American history, including the slave system, indenture and apprenticeship, housework, farm labor, factory work and office jobs, service work, and child labor. We will, in addition, track changes in labor laws and struggles over workingconditions, wages, and workers' organizations. We will consider a series of questions: Who worked? What counted as work? When and how were certain workers rendered obsolete? How were racial and gender hierarchies made and remade through labor systems? When, how, and why did workers challenge the authority of employers? When were workers' struggles successful or not? When and why did the state intervene in labor conflict? This is an interdisciplinary course; we will explore a wide variety of sources. We will read some of the major studies in American labor history along with some powerful and long- neglected primary documents \u2014 including Congressional reports, court cases, immigrant letters, slave petitions, business stationery, poetry, photographs, and film.

U08 Educ 4288 Higher Education in American Culture Colleges and universities in the United States have been the sites of both cultural conservation and political and cultural subversion from their founding in the 17th and 18th centuries. They have been integral to the nation's and to regional cultural and economic development. In addition, they have functioned as one component of an increasingly diversified and complex system of education. This course, a reading colloquium, surveys higher education in American history, including the ideas that have contributed to shaping that history, beginning with its origins in European institutional models. We use the primary and secondary readings to examine critically its conflict-ridden institutional transformation from exclusively serving the elite to increasingly serving the masses.

Same as L12 Educ 4843 Credit variable, SSC U08 Educ 4890 The Science and Politics of Testing in the United States Why do tests permeate American society? Tests have been integral to the decision-making process in many venues of American culture (e.g., immigration opportunities, voting rights, college admissions, workforce considerations, special education placement, educational reform, and graduation requirements). The credibility of these decisions depends upon the claim that a particular test is a scientific instrument and relevant to the decision-making process. This claim is worthy of study. Thepurpose of this course is twofold. The first purpose is to examine how the nexus of science and politics influence testing practices in American society. The second purpose is to explore how testing practices influence the culture of schools, civil liberties, the work place, and public discourse about merit. Same as L12 Educ 4891 Credit 3 SD U08 Educ 4891 Education and Public Policy in the United States This course takes a triangulated approach to the field of public policy as it relates to education and social problems. First, the course emphasizes theories of public policy that frame the field of policy studies. Major questions extending from this course feature include: What is public policy, policy behavior, its defining processes/features and what social function does it serve? Second, the course emphasizes the skills related to the exercise of policy analysis. These skills include the crafting of technical documents within the field of public policy (e.g., a policy brief) and the application of scientific methods to the exploration of social problems/governmental actions. Likely issues related to this course feature include the use of scientific knowledge in political arenas, engagement with stakeholders and the intended/unintended consequences of policy science to political decision-making. Third, this course simulates the policymaking context through students' participation in mock congressional testimonies. These focal areas will become central to an understanding of four social concerns: school desegregation following the Brown decisions; affirmative action in higher education; Head Start programs; and/or the ESEA Act of 1965, also known as No Child Left Behind. Educational opportunity, achievement inequality and social change will be the primary interests that link these course features.

International Affairs Breathtaking changes in political, economic and social relations have taken place over the past several centuries. Living and working in a rapidly changing global environment presents great opportunities to advance the human condition, promote growth and development, create political liberties, recast bargains between governments and their societies, transform social welfare, and advance the boundaries of knowledge and scientific exploration. Yet, the same context presents great risks as people fear loss of identity, worry about economic subordination and loss to those beyond their borders, encounter environmental degradation, and confront potential decline in personal and social autonomy. Our heightened economic, political, social, cultural, and environmental interdependence generates serious challenges in areas such as social justice, health, security, development, human rights, social welfare, inequality, diversity, and technology. The challenges create the possibility of conflict, but also for cooperation and compromise.The Masters of Arts in International Affairs offers an interdisciplinary approach to understanding global issues. The program draws on teaching and expertise from Washington University faculty and experienced practitioners in the St. Louis region, and it provides knowledge and skills for understanding and working with some of the most difficult international and cross-cultural problems that states, societies, and communities face. Students have the opportunity to tailor their studies to explore topics such as global politics, global economics, development, international security and conflict, international business, human rights, the role of gender, the environment and sustainability, and issues of regional importance. Whether students are studying full-time or part-time, a range of on-campus and online courses makes it possible for them to shape their degree according to their interests and schedules. Contact: Andrew Sobel Email: sobel@wustl.edu Website: http://ucollege.wustl.edu/programs/ graduate/masters-international-affairs Degree Requirements Master of Arts in International Affairs Total Requirements: 30 units The Master of Arts in International Affairs is a 30-unit program that includes four core courses and a capstone project, which is either a Directed Research Project (3 units) or a Master's Thesis (6 units). The purpose of the required core courses is to develop a coherent structure underpinning the AM by ensuring some common theoretical foundations, knowledge, and language shared by students in this program and with graduates of similar programs around the world. This contributes to the building of a professional community and identity. In addition to the required courses and the capstone project, at least three courses must be home-based in International Affairs. Remaining electives may be chosen from International Affairs seminars or from other graduate-level courses approved by University College. Required Core Courses: 12 units Students must take four core courses aimed at students acquiring a common understanding of foundational knowledge and skills for analyzing international affairs, enhancing their abilities to be thoughtful and critical users of academic research in applied settings, and pursuing careers in the field. One required course is a research writing and methods seminar that helps students develop systematic tools for use as practitioners who write and present their work. The other three core courses, selected from a list of core courses, provide a theoretical and substantive foundation for the analysis and understanding of international affairs. These are designed to enable students to develop expertise and understanding of dominant analyticalBulletin 2017-18 University College - Graduate (06/27/17) 55frameworks, tools, and common language in the field of international affairs to engage with other professionals in the field. A selection of three core courses, which are overlapping, ensures that this foundation will be sound and robust. Methods and Research Design (IA 524). Students work to produce a research proposal for a significant question in global affairs, which can be academic or applied. The workshop proceeds step-by-step: assessing what good research looks like from different disciplinary perspectives, building a \"doable\" research question as a puzzle to be explored and one that engages others, elaborating different theoretical approaches that might help explain the puzzle, constructing a literature review relevant to the research question, deciding what type of data/information is best to answer the proposed question, speculating about what pitfalls might threaten confidence in the research, and determining what are some of the potential implications of the research. The workshop will be highly structured and highly interactive with fellow students providing critique and input at each step of the process. At least three of the courses listed below: International Organizations (IA 509) International Law and the Use of Force (IA 511) International Economics (IA 5181) International Growth and Development (IA 519) American Foreign Policy (IA 535) Politics of Global Finance (IA 5571) International Political Economy in Theory and Practice (IA 559) International Relations (IA 574) State Failure, State Success and Development (IA 5772) Global Political Economy (IA 5780) Capstone Project: 3-6 units After completing formal course work, all students are required to complete a capstone research project under the supervision of a Washington University faculty member.

U85 IA 5024 International Organizations This course surveys in historically and theoretically informed fashion the role of various international institutions in international relations. It addresses the fundamental question of the contribution of international institutions to world order. The course first traces the historical evolution of international organization before turning to international institutions since World War II. It then focuses on the following: the most important regional international organization, the European Union; the most important international organizations dealing with the issues of peace and security, the United Nations and NATO; and the major international economic institutions, the WTO, the IMF and the World Bank. Prerequisites: Intro to International Politics. Same as U25 PolSci 3024 Credit 3 units. U85 IA 5030 Levels of Analysis: Thinking Theoretically A theory is a set of propositions and concepts that combine to explain phenomena by specifying the relationships among the propositions. Theory's ultimate goal is to predict phenomena. Good theory can explain events across space and time (e.g., it works just as well in Iran as in Columbia; and just as well today as in the Peloponnesian War). Theories provide a framework through which to understand everyday events in international relations, and to answer the basic foundational questions in the field-how can human nature be characterized? What's the relationship between the individual and society? What are the characteristics and role of the state? How's the international system organized? Theories abound in international relations: classical realism, structural realism, liberalism, constructivism, Critical Theory, Feminism, English School, post-structuralism, post-modernism, to name some of the more prominent ones. These different theoretical approaches help us see international relations from different viewpoints. No single approach can capture all the complexity of contemporary world politics. The list of possible explanations a theory provides can be usefully organized according to three levels of analysis-individual, state, international. Dividing the analysis of international politics into levels helps orient our questions and suggests the appropriate type of evidence to explore. Each level privileges certain variables, while abstracting others. This workshop explores the value of thinking theoretically in international relations; highlights what we gain (and lose) with theory; and analyzes the utility of each level of analysis for what it illuminates (and what it neglects). The written assignment will involve applying the three levels of analysis to a contemporary event. Credit 1 unit. U85 IA 5041 Islam and Politics Blending history and ethnography, this course covers politics in the Islamic world in historical and contemporary times.

UColl: IAA U85 IA 508 International Peacekeeping The notion that the international community as a whole has a responsibility for the maintenance of peace is one of the most notable characteristics of the 20th century. This was the chief reason for the establishment of both the League of Nations and the United Nations. And although the United Nations has ranged far beyond that agenda, it has always done what it can do to contribute to international peace and security \u2014 generally by way of what became known as \"peacekeeping.\" This activity has had a remarkably high international profile in the post-Cold War era. The object of this course is to analyze the nature of peacekeeping and place it in its political context (and hence to understand why its fortunes have changed so dramatically). Credit 3 units. U85 IA 509 International Organizations This course examines the role of major international organizations in the modern world \u2014 the UN, EU, NATO, IMF, WTO, MERCOSUR, and others. We explore the background for the creation of these organizations, the purposes they serve, and those whose interests they promote. We also consider how they adapt and evolve over time. Our survey centers on three broad areas of investigation: First, we examine how international organizations promote and maintain international security. Second, we consider organizations designed to regulate and promote economic growth and development. This entails a focus upon the process of globalization and the challenges presented in an era of heightened economic interdependence. Finally, we examine growing efforts at regional cooperation though the emergence of organizations such as NAFTA, the EU, and MERCOSUR. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAI U85 IA 5093 Politics of the European Union This course provides a political overview of the European Union and its 27 member states.

Using case studies, speakers, and readings, we consider the complexity of balancing cultural, economic, environmental, and political factors in rural subsistence agriculture communities. We work closely with the Missouri Botanical Garden (MBG) to identify and test the feasibility of different approaches to conservation and community-based, self-directed, economic growth at different Malagasy sites. The course uses an interdisciplinary approach (e.g., anthropology, business, design, engineering, law, social work, economics, political science, etc.) to understanding and applying entrepreneurial skills in a community development context. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAA U85 IA 5142 Sustainable Development and Conservation: Madagascar This course focuses on sustainable development in rural subsistence economies, using Madagascar as case study. Students from diverse disciplines are challenged to develop and assess the feasibility of projects that can have positive impact on communities constrained by poverty traps. The span of projects includes topics such as forest conservation and use, nutrition, health, food security, clean water, education, and bottom up economic growth. Students in Humanities, Social Sciences, Business, Design, Engineering, Physical Sciences, Law, Social Work, Economics, Political Science, Public Health and others use their different perspectives to search for answers. Teamwork and peer teaching are central to the course. Competitively evaluated projects will be field-tested in Madagascar. Selected teams will travel to Madagascar in May and work with the Missouri Botanical Garden Community Conservation Program to adapt projects to conflicting environmental, cultural, economic, and political factors. Poster board sessions for students taking the trip occur in the fall term. Project teams selected to go to Madagascar will be assessed a lab fee at the time their participation in the trip is confirmed. The lab fee covers the cost of airfare, in-country transportation, and approximately three weeks of in-country lodging and food. Students may not withdraw from this class after 2/28/17.

U85 IA 517 Bureaucracy in Global Perspective Bureaucracies carry out much of the day-to-day work we associate with government: cleaning streets, mailing pension checks, and regulating workplaces. How comparable are bureaucracies across political systems with different histories, cultures, and resources? The course will begin by establishing a theoretical foundation for why politicians delegate authority to bureaucracies and why bureaucratic actions may diverge from politicians' expectations. We will then compare a variety of bureaucracies and bureaucratic structures including examples from Great Britain, Japan, and the U.S. Our goal will be to develop a set of theoretical tools that will enable us to understand the interface of bureaucratic and political structures, and the politics of bureaucracy itself.

In the 20th century, however, writers set out to explore, either by actual travel or else in their imagination alone, many of its lesser known corners: forgotten imperial ruins in Tunisia; remote and semi-primitive mountain villages of Crete; dusty and disease-ridden towns steeped in medieval customs in the Sahara; the secretive, aesthetically dazzling souks of Alexandria. In doing so, they often found many fascinating, if previously hidden and frequently disturbing places, peoples, behaviors. But sometimes, instead, they discovered mere symbolic fodder for an implied or sometimes even explicit critique of their own native lands and social mores. In this course, we shall consider examples of the former in works like Andre Gide's Immoralist , Nikos Kazantzakis' Zorba the Sheltering Sky, and Lawrence Durrell's Justine. As for the latter, our attention will turn to even more contemporary works, such as Derek Walcott's Omeros, which is partially based on the Homeric tale of Ulysses' wanderings around the Mediterranean, but which aims primarily at questioning the history of colonialism and cultural memory of his own Caribbean island of Saint Lucia. While students will pay attention to the stylistic features of these works, to understand better the role rhetoric plays in such fiction, they will also study closely the various important sociopolitical, economic, religious, and philosophical concerns raised by their authors. Some excerpts of film adaptations of these works are also used. Primary readings should be mostly completed in advance of the course.Credit 3 units. U85 IA 531 The Intelligence Process This course examines in detail the origins, structure, and functions of the U.S. intelligence community.

These include domestic stability, nationalism, mainland-Taiwan relations and economic development. Within this context we will discuss China's expanding role in international and regional political and economic organizations as well as important bilateral relations, such as Sino-American and Sino-Japanese ties. In the end, the goal is twofold: to gain a broader understanding of what motivates much of China's foreign policy and to determine whether China is a rising power willing to play by Western \"rules of the game\" in order to peacefully develop its economy and society or whether the government believes that international relations are a zero-sum game that it can win in an effort eventually to rewrite those rules.

SD IA 5399 Jewish, Muslim, and Christian Scriptures: The Formation of Community Reading the sacred texts of the Abrahamic religions, we will examine how Jewish, Christian, and Muslim traditions use cultural symbols to create community. Since Christianity arises from and in opposition to Judaism, and since Islam both extends and also breaks with Judaism and Christianity, we will explore how the development of \"difference\" contributes to perceptions of religious identity. Noting that one of the important functions of cultural symbols is to counter threats of chaos and meaninglessness, we will further consider how Jewish, Christian, and Muslim communities use symbols to construct a humanly- meaningful sense of \"world\" and of \"history,\" concepts that are essential for maintaining group cohesiveness.

U85 IA 540 The Ball is Round: The Global Culture of Soccer First played in China 2000 years ago, the game of soccer has become the ultimate team sport worldwide (with the exception of the U.S.). Like no other sport, soccer has generated a notoriously fanatic fan culture, it has created a billion dollar entertainment industry organized in a multinational corporate association (FIFA) with more than 200 member states, and it has replaced ideologies, religion, warfare, or conquest as a source for national as well as local identity and pride. In this course we study the basic rules, techniques, and strategies of soccer, analyze its development from primitive but powerful techniques, and strategies of soccer, analyze its development from primitive but powerful \"kick and run\" (England, Germany) to the artistic ball-handling of the whiz kid (South and Central America, Africa) and the art of controlling space (Netherlands, France, Italy, Spain). Further topics include soccer and politics, the good fan and the hooligan, racism and the multicultural team, women's soccer, the local club and the national team, ways of watching soccer, soccer and globalization.

Previously unknown Islamic terms such as 'jihad' and 'fatwa' have entered the English language, and media coverage of various aspects of Islam have become routine. This course offers a framework for understanding the place of Islam in the modern world by considering its global presence in social and cultural life, as evident in literature, art, religious practice, and politics. We consider the recent history of Muslims worldwide, the legacy of colonialism, political Islam, religious reform and modernism, gender, spirtuality, literacy and artistic expression, as well as religious and cultural pluralism.

Our central objective is to examine how oil and natural gas shape our own lives and entangle us in the cultural, political, and economic lives of the rest of the world. We ask what anthropological and social science approaches might contribute to our understanding of a situation that has become, in most popular terms, a national \"crisis\" of global dimensions. Same as L98 AMCS SSC U85 IA 543 Religion in a Global Context Beginning with a genealogy of the idea of religion, we will concentrate on the emergence of the concept of \"religion\" shortly before and during the Enlightenment. We will then turn to the ways in which this newly emerging concept was applied to the study of non-Western cultures, which ultimately led to our current notion of \"world religions,\" partly as a result of the \"discovery\" of Buddhism, Hinduism, Confucianism, etc. We will then consider the secularism thesis and its current woes. Finally, we will examine religion and globalization, a topic addressed primarily by sociologists of religion.

How are governments reshaping the practice of war and diplomacy with the use of unmanned drones to fight wars, biometric eye and finger scanners to patrol borders and immigration, wiretapping on civilian populations to conduct surveillance of foreign terrorists, etc.? How are civilians and nonstate actors engaging in cyberwar, as in the network attacks from China on major corporations like Google? What does it mean that anyone (from militants to humanitarian groups) can now buy drones on the market from private firms? How has a former judge in Montana posed online as an Iraqi cyberspy for the U.S. government? We will assess theories and implications of these developments in readings from sociology, international relations, and science and technology studies. Guest speakers will be invited from institutions around the St. Louis region, suchas the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Boeing, legal specialists, and privacy advocates. Credit 3 units. U85 IA 545 Globalization and Its Discontents Globalization has inspired great controversy, with hopeful forecasts of the development of a utopian, borderless civilization ranged against dire predictions of anomie and the breakdown of local communities. We examine many sides of the controversy, from the meanings of globalization itself and its antecedents in the 19th century to the impact of globalization on national economies, politics, identities, and the environment. Considering the intersection of information technology and the global economy, we assess the prospects for a society increasingly dependent on the instant continuous flow of information.

U85 IA 574 International Relations Globalization, the accelerating rate of interaction between people of different countries, creates a qualitative shift in the relationship between nation-states and national economies. Conflict and war is one form of international interaction. Movement of capital, goods, services, production, information, disease, environmental degradation, and people across national boundaries are other forms of international interactions. This course introduces major approaches, questions, and controversies in the study of international relations. In a small group seminar we will examine the building blocks of world politics, the sources of international conflict and cooperation, and the globalization of material and social relations. Credit 3 units. UColl: OLH U85 IA 575 Introduction to Qualitative Analysis This class is designed to introduce students to the use and application of statistics techniques frequently confronted in political science articles and books. The goal of the course is twofold. First, upon completion of the course, students should be able to better read and understand many of the articles found in other courses within this program. Second, the course introduces students to the computer software program STATA in order to allow students the opportunity to begin producing their own statistical analyses. Topics covered include: linear regression, logit, probit and, perhaps most importantly, the presentation of quantitative data itself. No previous knowledge of experience with statistics is assumed or required. A university computer lab is used in part for class room instruction in the use of STATA. Credit 3 units.

We will look at some of the competing arguments about governments in failed and successful states and compare those arguments to the empirical world, or data. In so doing we will recognize that how governments affect development and economic outcomes in society is neither straightforward nor consistent with any of the ideological screeds that often dominate public discourse.

In this course we will read a range of texts, which will challenge students to consider the complexity and global significance of this fascinating geographical area of Latin America \u2014 \"our backyard.\" We will move through fields of political science, anthropology, popular culture, immigration, history, literature, and musicology. Credit 3 units. UColl: IAA U85 IA 5780 Global Political Economy Global political economy has changed tremendously over the past 20 years. Research agendas in international and comparative political economy increasingly overlap with the awareness of open economy settings. With greater and greater frequency, investigators of comparative and global political economy employ common independent variables even as their dependent variables differ. I find this development exciting as we build models of political behavior that can apply across fields. We will consider important issues in the political arena, but in so doing we will focus on the design of social research and evaluate the readings from this perspective. This should help students develop an appreciation for important questions in political life, but also help construct a toolkit for their research. Building and conducting a research agenda requires creativity, but above all an appreciation for a question and hard work grounded in systematic exploration. Credit 3 units. U85 IA 5781 Seminar in Political Economy I This course will borrow on the insights of international relations scholarship and economic theory to develop a broad understanding of international economic relations. Specifically, this course attempts to address the following two sets of questions: 1) How do global economic relations fit into the broader category of international relations? How do the existing theories in international relations (liberalism, realism, and Marxism) help us understand international economic relations between nation-states? 2) What are the effects of these international economic forces (trade, finance, and multinational production) on domestic governments and societies?

The course will be weighted toward treatment of the Russian Civil War period and World War II \u2014 the most mythologized and culturally significant conflicts for Russian and Soviet culture of the past century. Prior to World War II it was the Bolshevik Revolution and victory in the Civil War that justified the Soviet social and political order. After World War II, the special place of Stalin and the U.S.S.R. in world history was underwritten by the unparalleled suffering and triumph of its peoples in the war. Recently there has been an upsurge in the production of docudramas, television miniseries, and films about World War II, as Russia under Putin seeks to regain dignity and power in its perception of itself and on the world stage. At the same time, politically sensitive archives pertaining to the war, which began to be accessible under Gorbachev and with the breakup of the Soviet Union, are, according to Western historians, once again having their doors closed.Credit 3 units.

We go on to study some of Dewey's works on democracy and pragmatism with a focus on his commitment to democratic \"methods\" and ideals. We also focus on Dewey's notion that the moral aims and foundations of American democracy distinguish it from other democratic conceptions. We examine how Dewey links his views regarding liberty, community, and individualism to the domains of education,philosophy, and public life. Finally, we ground our studies in an analysis of democracy as it exists in America today, and consider if and how Dewey's theories prevail. Same as U89 AMCS 507 Credit 3 units.

U98 MLA 5120 Breath on the Mirror: Ancient Maya Religion Contemporary scholars of Maya religion are gradually coming to appreciate the grand myth cycles, cosmogonic visions, and understandings of the Maya divine beings, due in large part to the increasingly productive decipherment of ancienttexts and imagery. This course surveys what we know and how we document our current interpretations of ancient Maya religion. Topics include the Maya's famous calendar systems mathematics, astronomy, including Maya archaeoastronomy and time keeping. We will analyze the complexity and dynamism of Maya understandings of the supernatural. The class will examine enduring ideas and stories at the core of the Maya religion, as told in the Popol Vuh , the Quiche' Book of Counsel .

Readings begin with two key sources of American values from British political thought: Hobbes and Locke. Tocqueville will then teach us about the American social character in the 1830s, a set of values that is still with us but under attack in the present day. We will see these values expressed in practical terms by Emerson, Thoreau, Lincoln, and Martin Luther King. Henry Adams will give us a picture of theBulletin 2017-18 University College - Graduate (06/27/17) 76corruption of America's earlier values in the period after the Civil War.

UColl: ACF U98 MLA 5151 Discovering the Heartland The central regions of the United States, most especially the prairies, were slow to find their place in America's sense of itself. Called the \"Great American Desert\" on many early 19th-century maps, the interior grassland \u2014 with time and cultivation \u2014 proved able to feed a vast nation. What travelers dismissed as a \"waste\" and described as a kind of inland sea separating east from west came to epitomize America, became its heartland. This course will examine literary, political, and historical texts that mark our passage through this transition of thought and place. Readings will include exploration narratives, scientificreports, political speeches, and historical commentary (as well as \u2014 of course \u2014 novels and poems). Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5161 Utopia and Literature Various classical texts describe ideal \"utopian\" societies, descriptions which form a kind of \"utopian discourse,\" a way of talking about reality as something different from what it actually is. This seminar seeks to provide the proper conceptual background for a better understanding of how certain modern writers have used these utopian patterns of discourse to characterize an alien society. Beginning with Plato's Republic, Augustine's City of God , and Sir Thomas More's Utopia , students will isolate several important features of utopian discourse and study how these traits and ideas reappear in more recent works by writers from \"outside\" the societies they write about, e.g., the United States (Tocqueville, Democracy in America, and Baudrillard, America) and Japan (Barthes, Empire of Signs ). Two papers required: one at midterm on classic utopian texts; the second at the end of the semester, in which students are invited to apply what they have learned to any of a number of modern works.

U98 MLA 5173 The Origins of Political Thought in Classical Antiquity In order to understand the origins and development of politics and political ideas in Greco-Roman antiquity, we examine several of the most influential imaginative and philosophical texts of this period, including selections from the works of Homer, Thucydides, Sophocles, Plato, Cicero, Virgil, and Augustine. What is the nature of politics altogether and in its historically distinctive expressions in the ancient Mediterranean? What is the relationship between political ideas and the development of democratic, republican, and monarchic constitutions? Why is an understanding of ancient politics significant for citizens of modern democratic nation-states? To answer such questions, we concentrate on ancient ideas about virtue and vice, political education, citizenship, and the distribution of power and wealth.

Focusing on the issue of authenticity in art, we investigate how authors' depictions of their lives alternately mirror and distort the events they lived. Our examination of \"confessional\" works, including Shakespeare's Tempest, Ibsen's Master Builder , Lawrence's Sons and Lovers , Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, O'Neill's Long Day's Journey Into Night , Williams's Glass Plath's Bell Jar and Shepard's Buried Child , allow us to consider not only evidence of the authors' own lives but also how novels and dramas interrogate personal history to create meaning in art.

U98 MLA 5200 Visions and Re-Visions: 19th-Century Arts and Society In this multidisciplinary course we will examine how 19th- century literature, painting, and music reflected, as well as affected, contemporary Western life, both in Europe and the United States. We will consider how different writers and artists attempt first to represent and then to modify, either directly or indirectly, several important sociopolitical and economic situations of their time, such as the institution of marriage; increased urbanization and industrialization; and the spread of nationalism. Included among the literary works to be studied are Romantic,Transcendentalist, and utopian texts by Balzac ( P\u00e8re Goriot), Sand (The Country Waif ), Thoreau ( Walden), Hugo (Last Day of a Condemned Man ), Baudelaire (\"The Painter of Modern Life\"), and Robert Owen ( A New View of Society). In the field of art history we will analyze the social impact of paintings from the Realist and Barbizon schools. In the areas of theater and opera we will study works by Ibsen (A Doll's House ), Wagner (\"Opera and Drama\" and examples of his Ring Cycle). Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5203 America: Through a Glass Darkly This course studies depictions of America by non-Americans. We will examine the social, political, and economic aspects of their accounts and their influence on America's beliefs, policies, and international reputation. The class will consider fundamental values as well as ethnic and gender-based differences. Comparing historical periods from both western and eastern perspectives, students will read texts written during the past three centuries from England, France, Germany, Cuba, and China. For the colonial/Revolutionary War period, we will study Charlevoix, History & Description of New France and Cr\u00e8vecoeur, \"Letters from an American Farmer.\" Nineteenth-century readings include Tocqueville, Democracy in America; Frances Trollope, Views of Society and Manners in America; Dickens, American Notes ; Francis Lieber, The Stranger in America; and newspaper articles by Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed. Our discussions of the 20th century will focus on Kafka, Amerika ; Francis Hsu, Americans and Chinese; Beauvoir, America: Day to Day; and Baudrillard, America. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5204 Patterns of Thought Exploring how patterns shape our understanding, this seminar will focus on recurring motifs in literature and art. Our study of patterns will refer to thematic elements as well as to repeated figures, structures, and designs. We will examine the function of mirrors in paintings by van Eyck, Velazquez, and works of the Italian Renaissance, as well as the \"mirror function\" of paintings within paintings in works by Dutch Golden Age painters Vermeer and his contemporaries. We will also study the importance of mirroring in short stories by Borges and novels about novel writing (\"metafiction\"), including Krauss, History of Love ; Auster, The City of Glass ; and Knausgard's autobiographical novel My Struggle . The class will analyze the distinctive narrative structures of Lafayette, The Princesse de Cl\u00e8ves and Joyce, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man , novels in which art figures prominently. We will contrast these works with Flaubert's Madame Bovary , where art is eclipsed by consumerism, and Nolan's film Memento, which plays with chronological sequencing. We will further consider the patterns of urban landscapes evident in Abelardo Morell's camera obscura images of world capitals and Andreas Gursky's crowds and large-scale images, contrasting these contemporary works of photography with breaks in associative patterns in the surrealist paintings of Magritte.

Kieslowski's Dekalog, The Double Life of Veronique, and Red, White, Blue; von Trier's Zentropa, Breaking the Waves , The Idiots , Dancer in the Dark , Dogville; and Tykwer's Winter Sleepers , Run Lola Run , The Princess and the Warrior , and Heaven have fundamentally reshaped the landscape of European cinema since the early 1990s. Although they differ significantly in terms of their style and narrative focus, their films all raise intriguing questions about the nature of time and history; the role of chance and identity; and the process of filmmaking itself. Moreover, the work of all three directors urges us to rethink the role of European cinema in an era of international co-productions and transnational orientations. Students will have the option of viewing the films on Monday evenings or of borrowing them from the library to view before class. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5223 The Dysfunctional Family in American Drama One can say without fear of exaggeration that American drama is family drama. In countless plays from O'Neill to Tennessee Williams to Wendy Wasserstein and Sam Shepard, the family and its complex series of love-hate relations has been seen by our best playwrights as a microcosm of America itself, and its dreams and illusions. This course will examine the theme of family relations on the American stage from 1920 to the presentday. Along with a close study of individual plays we will also research the psychological and social underpinnings of the family in America, asking ourselves about its meanings, myths and functions. Plays include: O'Neill, A Long Day's Journey into Night ; Williams, The Glass Menagerie; Miller, Death of a Salesman ; Albee, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? ; Hansberry, A Raisin in the Sun ; Fierstein, The Torch Song Trilogy; Norman, 'night Mother ; Wasserstein, The Sisters Rosenzweig ; and Shepard, Buried Child .

Beginning with the implications of America's image as a \"brave new world\" in European thought and philosophy (including Shakespeare's The Tempest ), and the prescient view of our culture by de Tocqueville and others, we will examine how the dream of success and wealth has been depicted and employed in theater, fiction, cinema, and the visual arts. Texts include: Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby , Williams's West's Day of the Locust , Lorraine Hansberry's the Zoo Story\" and \"The American Dream,\" and John Guare's The House of Blue Leaves. We will consider modern painters whose work offers a commentary on the dream, such as Edward Hopper and Andy Warhol. We will also study cinematic innovators from Charlie Chaplin to Orson Welles and Francis Ford Coppola who have used \"The American Dream\" as significant elements in their work. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5242 The Literary 1960s: Years of Hope/Years of Rage Taking its subtitle from the one used by Todd Gitlin for his monumental sociological study of the 1960s, this seminar will focus on the diverse and exciting literature of this often chaotic, always fascinating period. Readings will include popular and influential books by Jack Kerouac, Ken Keasy, Tom Wolfe, Germaine Greer, Eldridge Cleaver, and Joan Didion. Attention will be paid not only to important new artistic, political, and social movements, as seen by these writers, but also to films and music of the time. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5243 American Voices Certain major novelists and poets exhibit a complexity of vision and voice that seems distinctively American. Emphasis will be on the personal and cultural sources and shaping of literary voice, its power to render and even create our experience, and its characteristic American registers: Romantic, metaphysical, discursive, lyrical, and colloquial. Selections may include Melville (Moby Dick ), Henry James, Faulkner, Hemingway, Frost, Stevens, Bellow, Ellison, Gass, and DeLillo.

U98 MLA 5260 Bridges to/from Cuba: Art, Literature, and Social Change We explore Cuba as a fascinating and much-misunderstood country, wrought by the rise and fall of plantation economy, capitalism, and socialist utopia. Using a combination of texts and documentary materials gathered by the instructor during her research trips to Cuba, we learn how longstanding patterns regarding race, national identity, class, and gender relations have evolved in(to) the socialist, and now the \"post-socialist,\" context. The class explores the intertwined histories of the United States and Cuba, on one hand, and the legacy of the sugar-and-slavery complex (the Black Atlantic), on the other. Topics include ethnic and gender identities, the myth of Che Guevara, \"revolutionary\" forms of artistic experimentation, African-Cuban religions, popular music, political oppression and dissent, and the Cuban-American counterpoint of migration and diaspora. Texts by Antonio Ben\u00edtez Rojo, Guillermo Cabrera Infante, Alejo and Excilia Salda\u00f1a, as well as selected essays and political speeches. Films, to be viewed outside of class, include Strawberry and Chocolate , Guantanamera, and The New Art of Making Ruins . Screenings will take place on campus, or students may use ARES to view them on their own. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5261 Romance Romances tell how lovers learn about the world and themselves by loving, suffering, and developing (perhaps) as individuals. An exploration of the genre over time, space, and culture, including examples from elite and popular literatures. Primary readings may include ancient Greek novels, the tales of the Arabian Nights, European medieval works (Chretien de Troyes's romances, European classics (Abbe Prevost's Manon Lescaut or E. Bronte's Wuthering Heights ), and contemporary sizzlers from the local supermarket. Several films will also be assigned and discussed, as will selected secondary readings. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5262 Love in the Novel/Love of the Novel The focus in this course will be our own pleasure in reading. How do we assure that this pleasure survives into the next century now that the visual, the sound bite, the video clip permeate our lives? We will attempt to answer this question by rediscovering one of the great love stories of all times, Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina. Daniel Pennac's Reads Like a Novel, a recent work about the pleasures of reading for pleasure, will guide us as we isolate elements of Tolstoy's story that compel us, that teach us about our own needs and desires as readers. We will explore how the pleasure of reading is inseparable from the power of texts to influence us. The class will consider novels whose love stories are molded by the characters' own reading and writing: Schlink'sThe Reader, and Peter Greenaway's film The Pillow Book. Far from being immune to or eclipsed by history and politics, the pleasure of reading will be shown to reflect the reader's appreciation of the larger fabric of society, where passion is set against war, prostitution and economic constraints, mental illness, adultery, and prejudice. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5263 The City in American and European Modernism The city has played an ambiguous role in the modern European and American imaginations. For some, the city offers personal freedom in an environment of social diversity and experimentation, while for others the city is a place of isolation, alienation, and fragmentation. We will consider these and other conceptions of the city, with particular attention to the relationship between the city and modernist aesthetics. The course will examine literature, theory, and film, including James Joyce's Dubliners , units. U98 MLA 5264 Literature of Affliction This course examines the prevalent themes of sickness and healing in literature. Writers have long represented illness of the wound both as an individual catastrophe and/or as a symptom of more widespread social ills. As a corollary there has emerged the figure of the healer, whose status reflects the urgency societies feel in the face of death. In addition to studying this fundamental tension between the malady and the cure, we look at how writers use the theme of affliction as a vehicle to examine other aspects of the human condition: what sickness means; how we heal; how standing at the precipice of death can sharpen our perception of life. Readings include Sophocle's tragedy Philoctetes ; The Book of Job; Visible; Paul Monette's AIDS memoir, Borrowed Time ; and a variety of short accounts of addiction by such authors as Edgar Allan Poe, Leo Tolstoy, and Dorothy Parker. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5267 City Limits City limits are the physical boundaries that delineate a center of population, commerce, and culture. Whether the labyrinthine streets of an actual city, the confines of a royal court, or the highly ritualized space of the convent, the circumscribed space that we explore offers itself up as a map to human experience that is at once alienating and exhilarating. We examine ways in which the city breeds anonymity, struggle, power, and pleasure in texts and images from the Middle Ages through the present. Works to include Christine de Pizan's Book of the City of Ladies, Mme de Lafayette's Princesse de Cl\u00e8ves , paintings by Johannes Vermeer and contemporaries, Denis Diderot's Nun, Nikolai Gogol's Petersburg Tales , Saul Bellow's Adventures Augie March, Michel Butor's Passing Time , Italo Cavino's Imaginary Cities, Amos Gitai's film House in Jerusalem , and contemporary photographs by Andreas Gursky and Abelardo Morell.

The course material is arranged thematically around such social and cultural issues as city and country, contesting visions of culture, ethnicity, gender, imperial identity, gilded age utopias, technology, and the frontier. Readings focus on primary sources: essays, novels, and short stories by such authors as Whitman, Veblen, Howells, Twain, Bellamy, Chopin, and Jewett. Artists, Sargent, Homer, Remington, Sullivan, Saint- Gaudens, and others. Prerequisite: admission to Master of Liberal Arts or MA in American Culture Studies program. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5273 Land and Place in Modern Literature Modern life divides us between belonging and rootlessness, attachment and mobility, pastoralism and urbanism, nationalism and the \"global village.\" These poles define each other in tension: attachment to local place, for example, is deepened by the experience of placelessness, while the drive toward internationalism prompts the turn toward region and native soil. Literature of the past hundred years reflects and defines these issues though story, setting, and character. Readings include works by Tolstoy, James, Proust, Lawrence, Forster, and Lampedusa. Weekly writing assignments. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5280 Rembrandt, Vermeer, and The Golden Age of Holland This course will study the originality of Rembrandt van Rijn and Jan Vermeer, the two principal artists of the Dutch Golden Age. We will study why paintings like Rembrandt's Nightwatch, his many self-portraits and biblical scenes, prints and drawings allow his work to have an enduring appeal. We will also examine Vermeer's elegant scenes of contemporary life, such as the Girl with the Pearl Earring and Woman Holding a Balance, in conjunction with works by Frans Hals, Judith Leyster, Gerard Terborch, Jan Steen, and others. These artists will help us to appreciate how, amidst a war for independence, conflict over religious freedom, and lucrative overseas trading, the Dutch Republic saw the first modern economy, a new cosmopolitanism, and advances in science and industry. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5282 Shakespeare's Tragedies In this course we will closely read some of the greatest works of art: Shakespeare's major tragedies \u2014 Hamlet, Othello, Macbeth, and King Lear \u2014 with some attention to earlier tragedies and a late romance, The Winter's Tale , as it recapitulates and transforms tragic structures and themes. With a working assumption that Shakespeare is both \"of an age\" and \"for all time,\" our perspective will be dual. On the one hand, we will consider some of the historical, cultural, and literary conditions that make Shakespeare a Renaissance writer. On the other hand, we will contemplate and appreciate the astonishing resonance that these dramatic poems carry across time, as meditations about evil, suffering, dignity, and transformation. Credit 3 units.U98 MLA 5290 Exploring Medieval Literature This course will read widely in medieval literature, from Britain and Western Europe. We will investigate how authors depict battle (Beowulf, The Song of Roland), love (troubadour poetry and romance), travel, and quest (Mandeville's Travels, The Book of Margery Kempe ). In addition, we shall study work by some of the most important writers in the emerging vernacular literatures of medieval Europe: Marie de France, Jean de Meun (The Romance of the Rose ), Dante, Boccaccio, Machaut, Chaucer, and the anonymous poet of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Texts will be studied in translation, sometimes in full and sometimes in extract, and will be placed in their historical and cultural contexts. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5292 The Age of Victoria Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5293 Literature & Culture of the Later Middle Ages Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5294 Images of Empire The course will examine a variety of ways in which the immense and expanding British Empire centrally informed the literature and popular culture of the late 19th and early 20th century in Britain. We will examine accounts of explorers like Mary Kingsley, David Livingstone, and Henry Stanley as they trekked through Africa and the Near East to spread the gospel, seize territory, trade, discover, praise, and deplore. We will study the literature produced by Anglo-Indians like Rudyard Kipling, Englishmen born in India negotiating the complicated terrain of native and cultural \"homes.\" We will examine the writings of those who went to the East to govern, such as George Orwell and Leonard Woolf. In addition, the class will explore adventure fiction by authors such as H. Rider Haggard, A. Conan Doyle, and Wilkie Collins, for whom the Empire was primarily a fertile ground for projected fantasy, desire, and terror. We will also look at some images of empire, including political cartoons, advertising, and motion pictures. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5295 Love and the Exploration of the Self in Medieval Literature Love was a source of fascination and anxiety for many medieval writers. The class will examine the ways the greatest writers of the Middle Ages thought of love, considering it in its spiritual, sexual, parental, filial, human, and divine forms. Through exploring love in all of its forms, medieval writers developed many of the tools for understanding the self that we continue to use today. Readings begin with the Confessions , Augustine's great spiritual autobiography, and proceed through French troubadour poetry, Marie de Pearl, selections from Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5300 Modernism This course will explore modernism's search for new ways to narrate experience in a radically changed world. Traveling across time and space, from East to West, and into modern cities and uncharted locations, we will explore how writers and filmmakers in the 20th and 21st centuries experimentBulletin 2017-18 University College - Graduate (06/27/17) 81with innovative forms of artistic expression in response to the growing influence of foreign cultures; technological changes and developments in science; the globalization of world markets; and issues of identity, gender, race, and ethnicity. The class will analyze modernism as a rejection of social and political norms, a crisis of identities, and the fragmentation of life. Works to include Franz Kafka, The Metamorphosis ; James Joyce, Dubliners ; Joseph Conrad, Heart of Darkness ; Amos Tutuola, My Life in the Bush of Ghosts; Italo Calvino, If on a Luis Borges, Fictions; Alejo Carpentier, The Kingdom of This World ; Salman Rushdie, East, West: Stories; and Don DeLillo, The Body Artist , as well as films by Christopher Nolan ( U98 MLA 5301 Against the Grain: Transgression and Controversy in Modern Art We examine the public controversies that surround the development of modern art over the last 150 years, to probe the question of the social functions of transgressive art. After reviewing key theories of the avant-garde, we analyze both the persona of the modern artist (Van Gogh, Picasso, Pollock) and the place of women artists in the revolutions of modernism (Bonheur, Cassatt, Kahlo). We next consider modernism's testing of limits in asking what is (and is not) art (Duchamp and Brancusi). We study the most controversial exhibitions (from the First Impressionist Exhibition of 1874 to the Nazi Degenerate Art shows), and the challenges raised by modern artists' treatment of the body and of politics. We end with debates waged over public art in St. Louis, and with recent controversies over public funding of contemporary art. No prior knowledge of art history required. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5310 Mind-Brain and the Arts This course considers ways that recent research in cognitive science might shed light on four traditional topics in the philosophy of the arts. Each topic will focus on a certain type of art (although not exclusively) and on one or more mental faculties: How do pictures represent? How do we understand stories and what roles do they play in the life of the mind? What do we like in the arts and why, according to psychological theories based on brain research? What is style in the arts and can there be a scientific explanation of its history? A parallel concern is with how distinctive features of the arts might shed special light on the nature of the mind. Readings will include essays by prominent art historians, philosophers, psychologists, and scientists. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5321 Abnormal Psychology: The Major Mental Disorders This is an introductory course in psychopathology or the scientific study of mental health disorders. The course will include definitions, theories, and classification of abnormal behavior. Content will focus on symptoms, classification, prevalence, etiology and treatment of mental health disorders, including mood, anxiety, eating, schizophrenia spectrum, substance use, and personality disorders. Prerequisite: Psych 100B. Same as L33 Psych 354 and Quantum Ideas Two major advances in physics have revolutionized our thinking in this century: relativity and quantum theory. These theories represent departures from intuitive physics which had been largely based on everyday phenomena and experimentation of modest scale. Many of the central ideas of relativity and quantum theory can be reviewed without any more mathematics than high school algebra. There will be introductory and complementary material such as Newtonian mechanics as the prelude to relativity, and classical ideas about the nature of light and waves before introducing quantum ideas. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5351 Mark Twain - Humor and Politics in 19th- Century America Mark Twain's unique status as a writer who has become a cultural icon cannot be explained merely in terms of literary gifts and aesthetic achievement. He is America's best-known author in large part because of his engagement with issues central to our institutions and political practice. The \"southwestern\" humorists who profoundly influenced his work used humor as a basis for political commentary and cultural criticism, a tradition to which Twain's own satirical treatment of everything from Congress to juries belongs. This course will examine both the literary achievement of Mark Twain and the ways in which his writings provide a critique \u2014 built over a lifetime \u2014 of American culture, probing the central issues of our politics (domestic and international) and our complicated relationships to one another. Same as U89 AMCS 535 Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5353 Cultural Geography: Mapping Paris This course explores how, over centuries and across national borders, Paris remains central to our sense of Western culture. Our focus on Paris will extend from the 16th century through the present via pairings that join the French capital with other European cities. We will study King Francis I's expansion of the Louvre in Paris in conjunction with the proliferation of castles in the Loire Valley, the court's patronage of Italian artists, and the arrival of Leonardo da Vinci in Amboise. The class will examine the 17th-century court of Versailles as it casts a shadow over Paris, and we will compare the art of the French monarchy during this period with that of Vermeer and his contemporaries in Delft and Amsterdam. We will analyze views of Paris and London the 18th century that show new architectural features and home decor, and we will contrast paintings of Boucher, Fragonard, and Watteau in France with those of Hogarth and Gainsborough in England. The class will consider desire in the 19th century as it radiates both through Paris in Flaubert's Madame Bovary and Vienna in Freud's Dora. We will consider contemporary portraits of Paris and New York in Barbery's Elegance of the Hedgehog and Foer's Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close . The animated film Triplets of Belleville will offer a contemporary take of these cities. Open to all MLA and DLA students, including those who have taken Paris and New York. Credit 3 units.

The class will also explore the impact of Darwin's theory on concepts of human society and human beings' place in nature. Readings, which will be mostly from primary sources, include writings by Darwin and his contemporaries as well as by subsequent generations of social thinkers who tried to apply Darwinian theory to society (including social Darwinism, eugenics, sociobiology, and evolutionary psychology). The course will end with a discussion of evolution and religion, from Bishop Wilberforce through the Scopes Trial to contemporary \"scientific\" creationism. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 537 Physics and Controversy Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 538 Desire and the Marketplace We will explore how authors depict the impact of the economy on amorous relations, paying close attention to how market forces constrain the role of women. We will examine the striking similarity of women's roles in various societies as commercial relations take hold in a market economy and give rise to an increasingly visible bourgeoisie. Discussion will focus on how economic relations influence social relations; the role of individuals within this market; the pressures on women and marginal groups; the commodification of society; the role of the mother, the virgin, and the prostitute. Readings include Saikaku, The Life of an Amorous Woman ; Defoe, ; Balzac, Eugenie Grandet ; Flaubert, Madame Bovary ; Ba, So Long a Letter ; Emecheta, The Joys of Motherhood; and Borges, \"Meeting in August.\" Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5381 Art in St. Louis History From the first painting loaned to the Mercantile Library in 1846 to the formation of the City Art Museum (now the Saint Louis Art Museum) in 1909, art patronage in St. Louis was tied to the growth and development of the city's merchant class. These businessmen-collectors recognized art's potential as a tool for civic advancement and actively employed it at a variety of venues. This course introduces significant individuals in St. Louis as well as artists popular at this time and explores the growth of area cultural institutions within the context of social history. Same as U89 AMCS 538 Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5399 Jewish, Muslim, and Christian Scriptures: The Formation of Community Reading the sacred texts of the Abrahamic religions, we will examine how Jewish, Christian, and Muslim traditions use cultural symbols to create community. Since Christianity arises from and in opposition to Judaism, and since Islam both extends and also breaks with Judaism and Christianity, we will explore how the development of \"difference\" contributes to perceptions of religious identity. Noting that one of the important functions of cultural symbols is to counter threats of chaos and meaninglessness, we will further consider how Jewish, Christian, and Muslim communities use symbols to construct a humanly meaningful sense of \"world\" and of \"history,\" concepts that are essential for maintaining group cohesiveness.Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 540 Islamic Movements of Reform, Revival, and Revolution The continuous reassessment of Islam, as a religion and as a social, intellectual, and political movement since its inception 14 centuries ago and an examination of contemporary Islamic movements as only the latest manifestation of long-term trends. Same as U85 IA 493 Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5401 Islam and Modernity During the past three decades, the rise of political Islam in countries with Muslim majority populations has brought the Islamic tradition into the public limelight. Previously unknown Islamic terms such as \"jihad\" and \"fatwa\" have entered the English language, and media coverage of various aspects of Islam have become routine. This course offers a framework for understanding the place of Islam in the modern world by considering its global presence in social and cultural life, as evident in literature, art, religious practice, and politics. We consider the recent history of Muslims worldwide, the legacy of colonialism, political Islam, religious reform and modernism, gender, spirituality, literacy and artistic expression, as well as religious and cultural pluralism. We also study the question of Islamic identity as informed by contemporary Muslim figures of diverse leanings, such as Fethullah Gulen. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5402 The Ball is Round: The Global Culture of Soccer First played in China 2000 years ago, the game of soccer has become the ultimate team sport worldwide (with the exception of the US). Like no other sport, soccer has generated a notoriously fanatic fan culture; it has created a billion dollar entertainment industry organized in a multinational corporate association (FIFA) with more than 200 member states; and it has replaced ideologies, religion, warfare, or conquest as a source for national as well as local identity and pride. In this course we study the basic rules, techniques, and strategies of soccer. We analyze its development from primitive but powerful \"kick and run\" (England, Germany) to the artistic ball-handling of the whiz kid (South- and Central America, Africa) and the art of controlling space (Netherlands, France, Italy, Spain). Further topics include soccer and its socio-economic foundations, the good fan and the hooligan, racism and the multiethnic team, women's soccer and the gendering of the athlete, the local club and the national team, soccer and globalization. We read texts by Franklin Foer, Nick Hornby, Eduardo Galeano, and others. Films include classic soccer games, The Miracle of Bern, Bend It Like Beckham, and Shaolin Soccer.

Reading Sarah Dunant's Birth of Venus , which chronicles a young woman in Florence under the Medici, and Mme de Lafayette's Princesse de Cleves , which recounts a young woman's struggles at the French court, we will study the institution of marriage as it conflicts with lovers' passion. Interiors by artists Pieter de Hooch, Johannes Vermeer, Emanuel de Witte, Gainsborough, Boucher, Fragonard, and others enable us consider the domestic sphere and women's roles in the early modern period as they extend from the decorous to the thinly veiled erotic object of male desire. Novels set in Paris (Emile Zola, Nana ), London (Hanif Dakar (Mariama B\u00e2, So Long a Letter ), and films set in Los Angeles (Paul Haggis, Crash) and Mexico City (Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, Amores Perros [Love's a Bitch]) expose the tensions of modern relationships as they play out against the backdrop of fast-paced capital cities.

U98 MLA 5416 Urbis & Civitas: Florence Beyond the Tourist's Gaze This course explores the urban history of Florence, Italy, from its origins as a small Roman town at the edge of an Etruscan settlement to its contemporary position as the industrial, commercial, and cultural center of a sprawling metropolitan area along the Arno river valley. We will study Florence's long history as it comprises periods of rapid development, symbolic and intellectual pre-eminence, and political influence, on the one hand, and economic stagnation, internal conflicts, depopulation, and subjection to external control, on the other. Our focus on both the urbis (the built environment, the physical realm) and the civitas (the social constituency, the civic sphere) will reveal Florence to be a complex artifact that is constantly shaped and reshaped by human action and social imagination. In order to look beyond the tourist image of Florence that we have inherited from the late 19th century, we will examine what defines our experiences and conceptions of a city. This investigation will include comparisons of Florence with other urban centers and discussion about the meanings of urban memory, culture, and citizenship. Readings will address the study of the urban history of Florence as well as urbanization, urbanism, and the public sphere, including works such as An Outline of Urban History by Silvano Fei, Grazia Gobbi Sica, and Paolo Sica; A Brief History of Florence by Franco Cardini; and Florence: Architecture, City, and Landscape edited by Marco Bardeschi. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5420 History of American Architecture \"The perennial architectural debate has always been, and will continue to be, about art versus use, visions versus pragmatism, aesthetics versus social responsibility. In the end, these unavoidable conflicts provide architecture's essential and productive tensions; the tragedy is that so little of it rises above the level imposed by compromise, and that this is the only work most of us see and know.\" \u2014Ada Louise Huxtable.This course examines the ideological, political, economic and social determinants that have shaped the look of American architecture. Starting with a thorough survey of the historic development of American architecture pursued in a chronological reading of styles, forms, and major architects, the course examines key tensions in the development of American architecture. Students will undertake readings, site visits, and discussions that probe whether there is a distinctly American mode of creating architecture, and what contingencies illuminate or obscure that mode. The central questions of this course: What are the definitive characteristics of American architecture? Does the American practice of architecture espouse an exceptionalism, or does it emulate international precedents (or both)? Do the characteristics of American architecture reveal the social, economic, and political structures of its production? Ultimately, can we read an American building to reveal sense of national identity, individual political agency, the evolution of gender roles, the assertion of disciplinary and economic power, and the evolution of the American artistic sensibility? This course fulfills the Humanities and Fine Arts distribution requirement for the AMCS MA program. Same as U89 AMCS 420 Credit 3 units.

U98 MLA 5423 Conservatism and the American Right in the United States This course focuses on the post-World War II conservative movement, one of the most important and successful political movements of the 20th century. The class will consider the history and definition of the \"Right\" and \"conservatism\" in the modern Western thought; trace the origins of the American Right in the reaction against a modernizing, consumer- driven American culture; assess the rise of a self-consciously intellectual conservative movement after World War II and the ways in which activist guided and manipulated the broader American Right; examine the various strands of the conservative movement, from free-market libertarianism to anti-Communism to traditionalist antimodernism; explore the way in which conservatives gained control of the Republican Party and toppled the liberal establishment; explore the rise of the New Right (including populist social conservatism and politicized evangelical Christianity) and of neoconservatism in the 1970s; and, finally, analyze the subsequent splintering of the conservative coalition.

U98 MLA 5430 Imagining Germany in the Long Nineteenth Century Between the start of the French Revolution (1789) and the outbreak of the First World War (1914), Germany was transformed from a patchwork of over 300 sovereign territories into a unified nation-state with immense political and economic power. This course examines the crucial role played by literature and the arts in creating a sense of a German national community during this period. Our materials will include national anthems, fairy tales, painting, public monumental art, opera, essays,Bulletin 2017-18 University College - Graduate (06/27/17) 84propaganda, and popular culture, and we will investigate these materials with an eye toward the different and sometimes opposing visions of the nation and national character to which they give expression. Within this broader context, we will address the perceived contribution of men, women, and the family to the project of nation building; the role of language, of national heroes and legends, and of geography in creating a sense of unity; and the ways in which national identity is defined in opposition to a perceived Other (in this case, France). We will also consider Zionism as an offshoot of the European nationalisms and a response to anti-Semitism in Germany. Works studied include fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm; essays and poems by Johann Wolfgang Goethe, Heinrich von Kleist, and Berthold Auerbach; Germany, A Winter's Tale by Heinrich Heine; The Patrioteer by Heinrich Mann; and The Jewish State by Theodor Herzl. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5432 Religion in a Global Context Beginning with a genealogy of the idea of religion, we will concentrate on the emergence of the concept of \"religion\" shortly before and during the Enlightenment. We will then turn to the ways in which this newly emerging concept was applied to the study of non-Western cultures, which ultimately led to our current notion of \"world religions,\" partly as a result of the \"discovery\" of Buddhism, Hinduism, Confucianism, etc. We will then consider the secularism thesis and its current woes. Finally, we will examine religion and globalization, a topic addressed primarily by sociologists of religion.

The class will examine not only personal relationships but also social structures, economic systems, and political conflicts. Topics will cover issues of class, gender, and race; the construction of economic identities; and the formal structures and aesthetics of film. Students will be required to watch two films per week as well as to complete selected short readings. Credit 3 units.U98 MLA 5454 Medicine and Morality in Global Perspective What does it mean to be sick? What does it mean to be a patient, or a healer? Is it possible to imagine a universal morality in which our understanding of medical ethics is shared among peoples worldwide? What are some of the ethical dilemmas associated with genetic testing, organ transplants, and global disparities in health? Framed by these questions, our class will examine how culture shapes our concepts of disease and our expectations for treatment. Similarly, we will consider how social class, race, and ethnicity influence both health and access to health care worldwide. Our readings will focus on medical history and the evolution of diagnosis and treatment of disease; health disparities; the varying relations of patients and healers in different cultures; African health crises; public health controversies; folk illness in Latin America; medical technologies and ethical conflicts; and other issues of medical anthropology pertaining to the prevention and treatment of illness and the healing process around the globe. We will also discuss three documentaries: Frontline: Sickness Around the World; Donka: X-Ray of an African Hospital (Doctors Without Borders); and Dan Rather Reports: Kidney Pirates (with anthropologist Nancy Scheper-Hughes). Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5477 Optimal Plans \"Optimal plans\" refers to an ideal functioning, a \"best-case scenario\" for literary, artistic, and political projects. Between the initial conceptualization of a plan and its actualization, however, much can go awry. We will also be concerned with the implications of failed plans for those in power and for their subjects, as well as for us as readers and viewers. The course will take students from the Renaissance through the present and back again in order to highlight the goals and the actual flow of ideas that have shaped our thinking. In the first week, we will present the classic treatise about political planning, Machiavelli's Prince, followed by The Mandrake , in which Machiavelli comically demonstrates key aspects of his political theories. In the second week the class will test Machiavelli's theories by applying them to Tomasi di Lampedusa's brilliant historical novel, The Leopard , which traces the decline of the Sicilian aristocracy at the time of Italian unification. Leonardo Sciascia's novel, The Day of the Owl , will then allow the class to consider what happens when two sets of orders, state and mafia, vie for supremacy. In week three Harriet Stone will explore the art of celebrated 17th-century Dutch artist Vermeer, taking into account both the painterly perfection of his intimate scenes and the ambiguous moral message conveyed by his paintings. The class will compare the use of perspective in Vermeer's works to the brilliant strategies executed by the nefarious heroes of Laclos's Dangerous Liaisons . The following week students will examine the tragic complexities of birthright, inheritance, and family structure in Maupassant's Pierre and Jean and in Coetzee's Disgrace. During the final week of the course, we will identify strategic goals, both personal and political, underlying the great exploration of Christopher Columbus. Reading his diary and letters, the class will measure what Columbus (as inspired by Marco Polo) hoped to find in the New World against what he did in fact find there in order to consider the explorer's ultimate legacy and how, from our modern perspective, we reassess his accomplishments.

U98 MLA 5478 American Folklore in Context For the last several election cycles, candidates and supporters from across the political spectrum have invoked \"the realBulletin 2017-18 University College - Graduate (06/27/17) 85American.\" But what does it mean to be authentically American? A simple answer might be that they are \"us.\" A more complex one requires that we dive into American folklore. The scholarly field of Folklore may be defined loosely as exploring what we say, what we do, and what we believe. Following this schema, this course will probe the question of what it means to be \"American folk\" by examining how folklore informs and shapes the world around us and our everyday lives. More particularly, we ask how race and ethnicity, class and gender are encoded and contested through folk expression. Beginning with the question \"who are the folk,\" we will look at classic and contemporary texts in folklore studies to explore how our food, our stories, our daily rituals, and our music, to name a few, interweave to create a complex, multilayered, and uniquely American folk. Readings pair specific genres with different theoretical approaches and include our jokes, urban legends, folktales, foodways, music, and material culture. Crucially, we seek to trouble popular notions of folklore as \"antiquities\" to question how the lens of Folklore studies may reveal how American culture not only consists of folklore but is constructed by it as folk forms are deployed in contemporary contexts, from Slenderman to Snopes to modern slave auctions. The course will entail several small collection projects to give students an understanding of the work a folklorist does in the field and how folklore is coproduced within a community, and a longer research project. This course satisfies the Humanities requirement for the master's program in American Culture Studies. Same as U89 AMCS 478A Credit 3 units. UColl: ACH U98 MLA 5481 The Court of Louis XIV The court of Louis XIV represents the apogee of monarchic rule in France. The class willl study the king's role in the court and the elaborate system of court etiquette devised to support it as well as the architecture of Versailles and its spectacular gardens to see how the court's patronage of the arts reflects its political ambitions. Readings in the literature of the period including some of France's greatest writers of comedy (Moliere), tragedy (Racine), the psychological novel (Lafayette), and philosophy (Descartes and Pascal) express how the monarchy fashioned an ideal of itself that substituted for the real, mortal man who was king. All readings in English. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5482 Wanderlust: An Exploration of Travel Long before the advent of the supersonic jet and Expedia.com, Americans were driven to wander by an all-consuming passion for travel. Pilgrimage and discovery narratives were widely popular in the 19th century, and contributed to the ideal of America as a mobile and self-determined society, while souvenir- hunting and grand touring became fashionable pastimes of a growing middle class. Many of our own ideas about travel- and indeed, much of its allure- can be traced back to earlier periods and practices, images and ideas. In this course, we will explore travel in American culture during the 19th and 20th centuries, focusing on the rich visual, print and material culture associated with the traveler and traveling (guidebooks, travel narratives, advertisements, photos, paintings, souvenirs, etc.). Our exploration will take us far and wide, from popular tourist destinations (Niagara Falls and the Catskills) to what once seemed far flung destinations (Brazil, Japan, the Middle East, and Hawaii) to a World's Fair to our own backyards. Our apporach will be multi-disciplinary and hands-on, as we seek to understand American wanderlust through the study of cultural artifacts.Same as U89 AMCS 548 Credit 3 units.

In this course, we will read plays both by Shakespeare and by some of his most interesting contemporaries \u2014 including Kydd, Marlowe, Jonson, Webster, Beaumont, and Fletcher \u2014 and consider why some plays are \"of an age\" and others \"for all time.\" This course will count toward the major in English literature for day students.

U98 MLA 554 Paris and New York Cultural icons, Paris and New York represent brilliant successes in art, theater, film, and urban design. We will study how the French and Americans define themselves through their premiere cities, notably in the works of leading writers, artists, and architects. The themes of innovation and tradition, order and disorder, integration and isolation as represented by Emile Zola, Marcel Proust, Baron G.-E. Haussmann, Edouard Vuillard, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Alfred Stieglitz, Henry James, Jackson Pollock, Adam Gopnik, Woody Allen, and others will guide our examination of the powerful hold Paris and New York have on our imagination. We will study history as reflected in public spaces (monuments, museums, and the streets themselves), exploring how each city functions as a locus of collective memory even as it fashions the future. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 555 Environmentalism and the Wild This course will examine a series of reactions against the traditional teaching that the natural world exists for our (human) use. On the one hand, this anthropocentric (human-centered) tradition has lead to the widespread destruction of the natural world, and many philosophers have called for a biocentric (life-centered) or ecocentric (environment-centered) ethic. At the same time, we have seen a shift from viewing the unsettled world as a \"howling wilderness\" \u2014 a wasteland to be redeemed by human development and domestication \u2014 to a widespread sense that human life needs contact with the wildness of the natural world in order to be truly free. Readings will start with Thoreau and move up through contemporary environmental ethics and theories of the wild, including the poles of conservation vs. preservation. Credit 3 units.U98 MLA 5550 Truth, Law, and Fiction This course considers whether, in real life as in fiction, where enormous energy is devoted to finding the perpetrators of crime and bringing them to justice, justice is always served by the law. As part of our investigation into how we convince others of what is right, we will examine a wide range of texts, focusing on the role of storytelling for the sake of justice in both fiction and historical judicial records. We will explore interactions between literature and law in East Asia, the U.S., and elsewhere, using the art of narrative construction as a means to understand the establishment of truth claims and the creation of persuasive arguments. Readings to include crime reports from 18th-century China and \"crime case\" (gong'an) fiction from that period; films such as Rashomon and modern crime fiction from Japan; recent legal musings by U.S. Judge Richard Posner; Truman Capote's novel In Cold Blood ; plays about justice by German playwright Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt; explorations of justice and revenge in Ariel Dorfman's Death and the Maiden ; and reports from truth and reconciliation projects in several countries. Our critical and theoretical readings will range from Peter Brooks's Troubling Confessions to selected articles from the Critical Legal Studies debates, sections from Michael Riffaterre's Fictional Truth, and others.

UColl: NW U98 MLA 558 On Account of Illness: Stories on Affliction and Recovery This course will examine the fundamental tension between the malady and the cure. We will look at how writers use the theme of affliction as a vehicle for examining other aspects of the human condition: what sickness means; how we heal; how standing at the precipice of death can clarify our understanding of life. We will consider the difference between texts that focus uniquely on the malady (e.g., Greek tragedy) and those that posit the possibility of recovery (e.g., the story of Christ healing the leper, the raising of Lazarus, Christ's own resurrection). Studying a variety of materials, we will observe how attitudes toward illness and healing have evolved over time, particularly with the advent of modern medicine. We will also consider how literary narratives of illness and recovery relate to other narratives concerning illness, including those of patients toBulletin 2017-18 University College - Graduate (06/27/17) 87doctors; memoirs; and reporting by journalists. Our study of the narrative of illness will enable us better to listen to stories of suffering, whether those of friends, relatives, or patients.

We will study how geologic events, largely through climate change, have dramatically shaped the course of human history and civilization. In our investigation of these transformations, we will trace earth's history, from its spectacular formation through our projections of its future. The class will explore how the earth's surface is a battleground between the dueling forces of plate tectonics (making mountains) and erosion (tearing them down), and we examine how humans have become the single greatest agent of geologic change on earth.

Reading and Shaffer's Equus, among other works, we will examine the power of myth to convey essential truths about human experience. Our interpretations will be informed through an appreciation of the original Greek sources as well as through critical theories that emphasize mythic and archetypal representations of literature.

We will consider the origins and continuing influence of this Boom both culturally and artistically, beginning with three of the most important novels of the period: Carlos Fuentes's Death of Years of Solitude . We will trace a series of literary reactions both in favor of and against the Boom, examining novels and short stories by Isabel Allende ( The House of the Spirits), Laura Esquivel ( Like Water for Chocolate ), Paz Sold\u00e1n ( Turing's Delirium ), with an eye to topics such as magical realism, women's roles in society, love and adultery, violence, and the role of art and popular culture in contemporary society.

Though marginalized in earlier art historical accounts of her period, Artemisia has received much critical attention as a figure of enormous determination and ambition who became an exceptional artist. Casting aside some of the expectations for 17th-century women, she created an oeuvre of great originality that had not been properly appreciated until very recently. She offers an exciting case study for our examination of how museum exhibitions shape artistic identity. Visits to the Saint Louis Art Museum and critiques of other exhibitions will enable students to acquire hands-on experience of the various facets of museum work, including the collection, care, and display of paintings, the production of an exhibition catalog, and the educational interpretation of works of art.

U98 MLA 5611 Visions and Revisions: 19th-Century Arts and Society In this multidisciplinary course we will examine how 19th-century literature, painting, and music reflected, as well as affected, contemporary Western life, both in Europe and the United States. We will consider how different artists attempt first to represent and then to modify, either directly or indirectly, several important sociopolitical and economic situations of their time. Included among the literary works to be studied are Romantic, Transcendentalist, and utopian texts by Balzac, Sand, Thoreau, Hugo, Baudelaire, and Owen. In the field of art history we will analyze the social impact of various paintings from the Realist and Barbizon schools and, in the areas of theater and opera, works by Ibsen, Maeterlinck, and Wagner.

We will read representative plays from every period and genre of Shakespeare's career \u2014 comedy, history, tragedy, romance \u2014 asking which elements (political, social, religious, theatrical, literary) are indeed \"for an age\" and which seem to transcend it. Plays will include Midsummer Night's Dream , Merchant ofBulletin 2017-18 University College - Graduate (06/27/17) 88Venice, As You Like It , Hamlet, King Lear , Othello, Antony & Cleopatra , Winter's Tale , and The Tempest .

We will investigate what motivates philosophers and scholars of religion to consider where food comes from; whether we eat communally or alone; whether we eat with gratitude, mindfully or thoughtlessly, quickly and/or with pleasure. Our class will consider the ethical foundations of what we eat, including contemporary animal rights philosophy, and aspects of the philosophy of hunting. Readings will include Tristram Stuart's Bloodless Revolution: A Cultural History of Vegetarianism ; Michael Pollan's Omnivore's Dilemma; Matthew Scully's Dominion: The Power of Man, The Suffering of Animals, and The Call to Mercy ; Peter Singer, Animal Liberation ; Tom Regan, The Case for Animal Rights; Jose Ortega y Gasset's Reflections on Hunting , and other works. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 567 Translating Worlds This course studies different forms of cultural translation, that is, the communication of knowledge, behavior, and language from one culture to another. We will examine how an author reworks earlier and foreign traditions, adapting ideas and practices for which there may be no direct equivalent in the author's own culture. In the new cultural setting, do the roles of men and women shift? Do questions of ethnicity, class, religion, and sexuality become more pronounced, or do they fade away? These questions will frame our study of historic cultural encounters, colonialism, exile, and other processes that shape modernity. Students will explore two dramatic points of cultural intersection: Tolkien's modern reworking of Sir Orfeo, a medieval version of the classical myth of the musician Orpheus and his wife Eurydice; and Goethe's Italian Journey, the journal of the German writer's experiences with the people, art, and history that he encountered during his travels. We will see how diaspora and migration shape perceptions in works by Alejo Carpentier ( The Kingdom of this and Jhumpa Lahiri ( Interpreter of Maladies ). The class will also learn how different scholarly and artistic fields address the concept of cultural translation, including cultural anthropology (James Clifford), film adaptation (Louis Malle's Vanya on 42nd Street, inspired by Chekhov's play), and colonial history (Vicente Rafael). In addition, we will discuss how digital technology affects cultural translation today (Google Translate, and projects using geographic information system [GIS] technology). Students will consider challenges facing the humanities and the sciences as these technologies advance. Will it be possible to make all knowledge, and all culturally-specific information, universally accessible? No foreign language experience required. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 568 Race and Ethnic Relations in the United States This seminar focuses on the social, political, and cultural factors that shape relations between different ethnic and racial groups in the United States. The course will concentrate on three general areas. In one, we will examine the socio-historical foundations of contemporary race relations by looking at the treatment of different ethnic and racial groups around the turn of the 20th century. In a second, we will consider variations in the political and social engagement of different racial and ethnic groups bylooking at the Civil Rights Movement, the political emergence of Native Americans, and the activism of Hispanics to name a few. And third, we will look at specific case studies that provide insight into the different social issues experienced by different groups, such as inner city life in poorer communities and the challenges of integrating into a white dominated society.

UColl: ACS U98 MLA 5700 Freud Then and Now Our class will trace how, from its classical beginnings in the late 19th century through the present, psychoanalysis has played a major role in science and medicine, in the academy, and in our everyday lives. We will study how Freud's ideas continue to inform our culture and how they continue to influence research in the humanities. Through close readings of Freud's major works, such as The Ego and the Id ; The Interpretation of Dreams (excerpts); Civilization and Its Discontents; and Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality , we study the broader social and cultural implications of psychoanalytic theory. We examine the influence of these texts on a century-long interrogation of the unconscious that includes Lacan, who reworked Freud\u00b4s ideas; feminists such as Luce Irigaray and Judith Butler, who challenged Freud's teachings, and, more recently, Slavoj Zizek, who engages Freud's theories in a critical analysis of culture. Students will consider not only the importance of dreams and desires but also how the unconscious shapes gender relations, cultural production, and even politics. Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 5701 The Making of the Modern Catholic Church This course will look at three church councils that put their stamp on the Catholic Church at key moments in its history, making it what it is today. The first section will be dedicated to the Fourth Lateran Council (1215), which defined the high medieval church as an all-encompassing papal monarchy with broad powers over the lives of all Europeans Christian and non-Christian alike. In the second section, we will turn our attention to the Council of Trent (1545-1563), which responded to the threat posed by the Protestant Reformation by reforming the Catholic church, improving clerical education, tightening ecclesiastical discipline, and defining and defending Catholic doctrine. We will conclude with a consideration of the largest church council ever, Vatican II (1962-1965), which reformed the liturgy and redefined the church to meet the challenges of the modern, multicultural, postcolonial world.

Even though genres such as the melodrama, the western, the romantic comedy, the musical, the science fiction film, the horror film, or the thriller are often seen as quite predictable staples of dominant filmmaking, they also inspire and allow for considerable formal experimentation and thematic departure. This seminar examines the logic of some of the most important genres of Hollywood filmmaking while at the same time emphasizing the creative possibilities of working with certain genre expectations. We discuss such classic representatives of certain genres as Imitation of Life ,Bulletin 2017-18 University College - Graduate (06/27/17) 89Stagecoach , His Girl Friday , The Day the Earth Stood Still , 42nd Street , and North By Northwest , and then juxtapose these paradigmatic examples with more contemporary films reworking or pushing the limits of the classical genre system such as Far from Heaven , Lone Star , Blade Runner, Dancer in the Dark , and Breathless . Credit 3 units. U98 MLA 573 Questions of the Soul in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam We will explore how all three western monotheistic traditions have subjected the topics of personal identity, human individuality, and selfhood to intense scrutiny in their theological, philosophical, and spiritual writings. Consistent with deliberations by major thinkers on the notion of the soul that lies at the heart of these concerns, we will explore whether the soul has a beginning and an end, or is instead eternal; how and why the soul is connected to the body; how souls relate to other souls; and the nature of the relation between human souls and God.

U98 MLA 5801 Staging Atrocity: Theatre of the Holocaust Responding to the Holocaust has challenged artists of every media. Nowhere is this more true than in the theater, where the immediacy of the medium, its human scale, and the tenuousness of the fourth wall serve to intensify its effect. We will read a careful selection of modern and contemporary dramas, exploring the range of responses. Underneath each weekly topic reverberates the nagging question of whether one can \u2014 or should \u2014 make art from the Holocaust, as well as a serious exploration of the uses and effectiveness of theater. We look at the ways in which the Holocaust has been used as a subject to raise moral dilemmas, examine the limits of humanity, elicit doubt or faith, and to provide political commentary, and the ways in which playwrights have stretched the limits of the theater to meet the challenge of staging the Holocaust. Topics considered include the nationalization and personalization of the Holocaust, the role of the second generation, issues of audience, the use of experimental forms and obscenity. The plays on the syllabus are from North America, Israel and Europe. All readings in English (original or translation). Same as U21 Drama 480 Credit 3 units.

U98 MLA 592 Decoding the City While architecture and infrastructure are worthy of study in themselves, often they signify more complex cultural meanings, mask efforts to erase or reorder the city, and conceal histories of injustice. This course presents methods for \"reading\" the built form of the American city to decode histories of architecture, culture, public policy and economics. City space can be read literally, but this course will unpack the symbolic meanings of urban spaces, neighborhoods, buildings and sites. Students will undertake readings that will present methods for understanding and analyzing the city's form, before delving into a specific case study of the Mill Creek Valley. As St. Louis' largest African-American neighborhood, but almost completely erased between 1959 and 1965 using city and federal funds, the site of the neighborhood remains a potent and under-examined part of St. Louis. The course will examine the history of the neighborhood as well as related histories of federal and local urban renewal policies, African-American cultural history and historic preservation. Research into the neighborhood will include experiences at local archives where students will learn to attain and apply primary source documents vital to urban history including Census records, building permits, municipal ordinances and insurance maps. Additional readings will offer insights into possible methods for interpreting and commemorating places that illuminate the urban built environment's historic past. The final project in this course will entail students collaboratively working on a public interpretive project for Mill Creek Valley where they can apply both methods of decoding and curating the city.

Having read every significant book published up until his time in an attempt to educate himself \"to perform justly, skillfully, and magnanimously all the offices, both private and public, of peace and war,\" Milton produced an epic poem of such scope and power that \"the world would not willingly let it die.\" We will closely read that poem, Paradise Lost , as well as his other major poems ( Paradise Regained ; Samson Agonistes ), adding lesser poems and prose works to illuminate his development as a writer and thinker, and his relation to theological, literary, intellectual, and political currents of the 17th century.

English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) The Department of Education at Washington University in St. Louis offers a Missouri DESE-approved teacher certification program in English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) for grades K-12. The ESOL certification program, offered through University College, provides a foundation in the theory and practice of English language teaching and learning. Overall, the certification program offers core knowledge of the field to support teachers in enhancing professional practice and careers in serving the needs of English language learners (ELLs). The course work supplies teachers with the current research and theory on language acquisition so that they can make informed decisions for the classroom. Students successfully completing this program will be qualified to apply to DESE for ESOL (K-12) certification in Missouri. As categorized by DESE, ESOL is an add-on certification; students planning to be state-certified ESOL teachers must already have their initial teacher certification or be concurrently enrolled in an initial certification program. Many courses within this program are available and may be of interest to students who are not specifically seeking certification. Please contact the educationdepartment if you are interested in the course work but not necessarily state certification. Students may consider approaching the ESOL program in one of three ways: A non-degree, add-on certification program for initially certified teachers A strand in the UCollege-based Master of Arts in Education for current teachers Professional development course work for those interested in education and ESOL The program courses will prepare our students to teach English as a second language (ESL) in the United States or English as a foreign language (EFL) in countries abroad, to learners at all levels of instruction. Upon completion of the certification or strand in ESOL, students may apply for employment in diverse learning environments, such as elementary, middle and high schools, independent or charter schools, international education programs, intensive English language programs, adult schools, community colleges and corporations, in the USA and abroad. A strong desire to work in a multicultural environment is essential for working as an ESL instructor, and the courses and experiences from our program will help professionals sharpen these skills. Some employers, especially public schools, may require teachers to have state certification, rather than just course work. The following faculty in the Department of Education offer course work appropriate for ESOL certification: Cindy Brantmeier (http://education.wustl.edu/people/cindy- , Professor Michelle Augustin, Adjunct Instructor Nancy Rathjen, Adjunct Instructor Other course work is offered by faculty who cross-list courses in the Department of Education of Other Languages (ESOL) Minimum requirement of twenty-one (21) semester hours that includes all areas and corresponding courses noted below: L12 Educ 4111 Linguistics and Language Learning (3 units)Bulletin 2017-18 University College - Graduate (06/27/17) 98Language and Culture or Sociolinguistics (3 credits; choose one course from below) Code Title Units Anthro 3386 Language, Culture and Society (L48) 3 Ling 339 Introduction to Sociolinguistics (L44) 3 Ling 341 Linguistic Diversity in the United States (L44)3 U91 Ling 466 Second Language Acquisition (3 units) Methods of Teaching Second Language Students (3 credits): instructor TBA U08 Educ 4023 Second Language Acquisition & Technology (3 units) ESOL practicum (3 credits): instructor TBA Elective course work (choose at least one 3-credit course; possible courses below, but elective courses are not limited to the following): Code Title Units Educ 4692 Second Language Reading and Writing: Theory, Research and Practice (L12)3 Span 467 Grammar and Vocabulary Acquisition (U27)3 Students may choose elective course work from such areas as English language, reading, composition, bilingual education or advanced second language methods according to the needs of their teaching situation.

Anthropologists are collectively interested in studying humans from a holistic perspective, including cultural, linguistic and biological anthropology and archaeology. This course aims to introduce students to basic concepts within anthropology, integrating the perspectives and methods of each of the subfields into our approach. We will examine how culture, environment, and biology are intertwined in the variation seen within humans both past and present. Topics addressed will include aspects of human evolution and variation, nonhuman primates, Paleolithic cultures, subsistence strategies, kinship, political organization, the rise and fall of complex societies, religion, language, globalization, and anthropology in the present and future.

U69 Anthro 280 Introduction to Anthropological Genetics Anthropology is the study of humans, past and present. In the post-genomic era, we now have the capability to uncover the genetic basis of being human. This course will examine the intersection of genetics and anthropology. Students will be taught the basic principles of molecular evolutionary analysis and population genetics that are applied to the study of humans and other primates. In addition, students will learn how genetic data can supplement the archaeological, linguistic, cultural, paleoanthropological, and comparative primate research of traditional anthropology. Specifically, we will survey (1) methods of measuring and drawing inferences from human genetic variation, (2) theories of modern human origins and peopling of the world, and (3) recent advances in studying the genetic underpinnings for human disease. The first portion of every class will be devoted to lecture while the latter half will be a discussion of the assigned articles. There will be one in-class laboratory in which we explore some of the electronic resources available to anthropological geneticists. Finally, we will spend part of one class engaged in lively scientific debate over the question: are modern humans still evolving? Students should leave this class with a basic understanding of the contribution of genetics to the field of anthropology and how anthropological knowledge can illuminate genetic findings.

U69 Anthro 3037 Animals and Monsters in Antiquity The mythologies of dragons, giants, and sea-monsters can be better understood through the study of human/animal relations. From the early fossil hunters of prehistoric periods to modern day shepherds and mariners, this course examines the fascinating bond between humans and other species from the Paleolithic period in Europe and Western Asia to the present. Jungian exploration of the human psyche delves deeper into the phenomenon that produces demons in each individual and in every culture. The spiritual and secular uses of animals are discussed, as well as cross-cultural manifestations of monsters. Emphasis will be placed on the Archaic to Classical period in Greece when ancient testimonia, myth, epics, and iconography were particularly rich. Following this course, students should develop insight into the complex symbiotic relationship of humans and animals. Students should also be able to recognize and interpret the creation and manifestation of myths and mythological creatures through understanding cultural, psychological, and environmental contexts.

UColl: NW U69 Anthro 3215 Food, Culture, Power The foods we eat, the way we get them, the way we produce them, and the way in which we eat them speak volumes about our beliefs, our technology, our understanding of how the world works, and our ability to function within it. Food connects consumers and producers through vast global supply chains that enable cheap fresh food year-round for some but require others to live on desperately low wages. Throughout the world, the way we eat has serious consequences for how we make a living, manage our environment, and stay healthy. This course is designed to make students think critically about the food they eat and the way it is produced. This course is divided into four parts and each week will have a thematic focus. We will begin at the beginning \u2014 the origins of agriculture, modern hunting and gathering, and pastoralism. What did we evolve to eat? Is agriculture \"better\" than hunting and gathering? What does it mean to say that? The third section of the class will introduce us to the commodity chain \u2014 the way by which people who do not produce food themselves eat. How have the history and politics of our economy shaped the way that we eat globally? How has food been used to understand other cultures? Then we will discuss the views of food and agriculture that have informed our modern perception of food and production. Are there too many people? What does the future of food look like? Why do some foods make us nauseous while people love them? We will conclude by examining the recent wave of interest in alternatives to that system, questioning how food came to take such a prominent place in our society after such a long period of neglect.

U69 Anthro 3476 Archeologies of Graffiti from Antiquity to the Present The modern story of graffiti \u2014 revolving around social, economic, and political contexts such as bathroom stalls, subways and alleys steeped with urine and trash, decrepit buildings and train cars situated in less reputable areas of cities and towns \u2014 leads people to associate it with antisocial behaviors, dissent, and the vandalism of public and private property. However, some people consider graffiti as a legitimate form of art, communication, and a somewhat anonymous expression of current social climates. The disparity between these two perspectives has provided a great deal to study for social scientists. However, a consideration of graffiti's simple definition \u2014 words or drawings etched or painted on some surface in a public place \u2014 leads us to recognize that feats of graffiti originate way before the inner-city movements of the 1970s. In this class we will draw upon a range of studies from archaeology, anthropology, sociology, art, and history to broadly explore the creation and meaning of graffiti from antiquity to the present. Our goal is to learn how to examine the form, function, and context of graffiti across cultures and through time, with regard to the circumstances of its creation. In doing so, we aspire to better understand what lies behind the human urge to leave a mark. Prerequisite: Introduction to Archaeology. Credit 3 units. U69 Anthro 351 Africa in the Modern World This course is about current concerns and issues affecting the cultural, economic, political, social, and religious change in Africa and how these processes are in turn informed and shaped by events and transformations taking place in the modern world.

U69 Anthro 3775 Ancient Eurasia & The New Silk Roads This course will explore the rise of civilization in the broad region of Eurasia, spanning from the eastern edges of Europe to the western edges of China. The focus of the course is the unique trajectory of civilization that is made evident in the region of Central Eurasia from roughly 6000 BC to the historical era (ca. AD 250). In addition to this ancient focus, the course aims to relate many of the most historically durable characteristics of the region to contemporary developments of the past two or three centuries. Fundamentally, this course asks us to reconceptualize the notion of \"civilization\" from the perspective of societies whose dominant forms of organization defied typical classifications such as \"states\" or \"empires\" and, instead, shaped a wholly different social order over the past 5000 years or more. This class provides a well-rounded experience of the geography, social organization, and social interconnections of one of the most essential and pivotal regions in world history and contemporary political discourse.

In managerial economics, these models are principally applied to specific decisions of businesses, such as profit maximization, strategic behavior, and industry entry and exit. A managerial economics major will complete courses in quantitative techniques, such as regression analysis, as well as course work in related areas of business, such as accounting, management, and finance.

Same Education At Washington University, the teacher education programs are designed to produce teachers who implement an inquiry approach to education. Based upon the belief that teaching is a complex, normative, and changing activity, teacher education is viewed as an ongoing, problem-solving process as opposed to a search for the \"one right\" answer or \"one best\" way. Therefore, our students are expected to develop the ability and the inclination to look at educational policy and classroom decision- making from multiple perspectives, and to raise fundamental questions about the purposes, processes, and inequities of the current system. In addition, they are expected to act in ways that have a sound and defensible rationale rooted in research, ethical standards, and personal experience, and to reflect upon and reconsider that practice in the interest of all of their students. Requirements Bachelor of Science in Education All University College undergraduate students must satisfy the same general-education requirements (p. 105). To beBulletin 2017-18 University College - Undergraduate (06/27/17) 131considered for the undergraduate teacher education program, students must: have completed 60 credit hours or more toward the undergraduate degree; have a 3.0 grade point average in their other major and a 3.0 grade point average in all courses taken; pass the MOGEA test; and submit an application, official transcripts, and two letters of recommendation. When a student's application is complete, an interview will be scheduled. Applications are considered once a semester. Declaration of an education major does not imply admission to teacher education. All students must be admitted to the teacher education program separately from admission to University College. More information is available from the Director of Teacher Education Office in Seigle Hall, Room 131, 314-935-3571. The Major in Education The undergraduate Secondary (9-12) Teacher Education Program allows students to pursue a bachelor's degree and certification in English or social sciences at the same time. As part of this program, students must do a double major: one in education, and a second major in English or one of the social sciences (history, political science, or international studies). The required education course work in this major totals 30 credit hours and includes a 3-credit foundations course, the English or social sciences subject area curriculum and instruction courses, and student teaching. In addition, students must complete specific, state-required course work in the English or social sciences major. They must attain sophomore status (60+ credit hours) and pass the state-required MOGEA exam before being admitted to the teacher education program; however, students should consult an education adviser about state requirements as early in their academic program as possible. Any student who pursues teacher certification must meet state requirements, including a passing score on a subject-area examination, before Washington University can recommend them for teacher certification. State requirements and national standards for teacher certification change frequently. Thus it is important for any student pursuing teacher certification to consult with an education adviser early and often.

Same as L12 Educ 4843 Credit variable, SSC U08 Educ 4890 The Science and Politics of Testing in the United States Why do tests permeate American society? Tests have been integral to the decision-making process in many venues of American culture (e.g., immigration opportunities, voting rights, college admissions, workforce considerations, special education placement, educational reform, and graduation requirements). The credibility of these decisions depends upon the claim that a particular test is a scientific instrument and relevant to the decision-making process. This claim is worthy of study. The purpose of this course is twofold. The first purpose is to examine how the nexus of science and politics influence testing practices in American society. The second purpose is to explore how testing practices influence the culture of schools, civil liberties, the work place, and public discourse about merit. Same as L12 Educ 4891 Credit 3 SD U08 Educ 4891 Education and Public Policy in the United States This course takes a triangulated approach to the field of public policy as it relates to education and social problems. First, the course emphasizes theories of public policy that frame the field of policy studies. Major questions extending from this course feature include: What is public policy, policy behavior, its defining processes/features and what social function does it serve? Second, the course emphasizes the skills related to the exercise of policy analysis. These skills include the crafting of technical documents within the field of public policy (e.g., a policy brief) and the application of scientific methods to the exploration of social problems/governmental actions. Likely issues related to this course feature include the use of scientific knowledge in political arenas, engagement with stakeholders and the intended/unintended consequences of policy science to political decision-making. Third, this course simulates the policymaking context through students' participation in mock congressional testimonies. These focal areas will become central to an understanding of four social concerns: school desegregation following the Brown decisions; affirmative action in higher education; Head Start programs; and/or the ESEA Act of 1965, also known as No Child Left Behind. Educational opportunity, achievement inequality and social change will be the primary interests that link these course features.

The beautiful and the well-argued, the felt and the reasoned, the actual and the possible, the message and the medium: students of literature do not treat these spheres as distinct aspects of human existence. In our department, they bring them together. The result is that an English major is recognized as a strong foundation for careers in communications, business, law, social work, the fine arts, and teaching. Course work introduces students to important literary texts and to the development of the English language and the origins of Western literature and culture. Students develop reading and writing skills, rigorous critical thinking skills, and the ability to communicate complex ideas persuasively, all while obtaining a broad liberal education.

A&S: TH A&S HUM, Reading Plays: Major Dramatists This course will explore the development of drama from the ancient Greeks to the present, covering key masterworks with the aim of promoting understanding and analysis of dramatic texts as a form. As a course abut drama, this encompasses great things: life and death, war and peace, religion, identity, connections, loss, beauty - even meaning itself. We'll bring our own experiences with these and more to bear on these plays, but we're also going to read them in their own terms. We will emphasize close analysis and interpretation of the plays we read as literary texts, exploring how plot, character, language, symbols, and themes are manipulated by dramatists in a range of ways. Historical and performative contexts will be addressed, as will the basic cornerstone approaches of critical theory. Throughout the course, we will reflect on why these plays are culturally important and worthy of study, while never losing sight of the visceral excitement these works of art can engender.

Students will study how the Romantics adopted and adapted the satanic as a counterforce to rationalism and political repression. Often defining by negation, the devil in these books will expose us to core concepts in Western thought including servitude and freedom, cosmic evil and redemption, discipline and justice, possession and liberation. Authors will include Goethe, Blake, Byron, Shelley, Lewis, and Hoffmann. Finally, we will consider a few 20th-century manifestations of the satanic, each borrowing from earlier works and traditions, including Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita and Rushdie's The Credit 3 units.

U86 HCARE 326 The Doctor Is In: Anton Chekhov and Narrative Medicine Anton Chekhov was one of the greatest Russian writers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was also a successful practicing physician. How did he manage to balance both of these full-time careers? How did being a trained physician affect his writing and how did being a writer affect his medical practice? Why did he emerge as arguably the most influential short story writer of the 20th century? Did being a doctor and scientist have anything to do with this, or did he achieve success in spite of having a second career? Understanding the ways in which Chekhov was able to integrate and express cultural attitudes towards illness, mortality, medicine and healing at a time of great change and social upheaval will be the subject of this class. Equally important will be applying some of his wisdom and techniques to understanding our own current cultural narratives about medicine, as both an ideal and a real practice.

History Meditating on the history of the American South, novelist William Faulkner famously proclaimed, \"The past is never dead. It's not even past.\" Learning about the relationship of past to present is what history is all about. The past is indeed not past: it shapes, in complex and powerful ways, the world we live in now. Yet the past can be radically different from the present. Studying history allows us to grasp the immense variety of human experience across time, place and culture; to develop insight into the ways that people understand themselves in relation to the societies in which they live; and to engage critically with contemporary issues. Students who major in history at Washington University are encouraged to cultivate a broad understanding of global themes while also having the flexibility to focus on areas of special interest. Our instructors emphasize the development of analytic skills that are useful not only in history courses, but in a range of occupations and professions including law, business, communications, education, and public policy. These skills include the ability to organize and interpret data, to develop logical and convincing arguments, to do research and sift the significant from the insignificant, to read with comprehension, and to write with precision and clarity. Whether students pursue a major, a minor, or simply sample our courses, studying history will help them to develop the knowledge and critical skills that are essential for life in an increasingly complex and contentious world.Contact: Margaret Williams Phone: 314-935-5450 Email: mwilliam@wustl.edu Website: http://ucollege.wustl.edu/programs/ undergraduate/bachelors-history Degree Requirements Bachelor of Science in History The major in history consists of at least 27 units.

U16 Hist 3301 Gender, Sexuality and the Atlantic World \"Gender\" is a complex term, informed by social and cultural expectations as well as physical anatomy, and this complexity was central to the creation of the Atlantic World, as historians have dubbed the exchange of ideas and people between Africa, Europe, and indigenous Americans after Columbus's 1492 voyage to the New World. Men and women behaved and were expected to behave differently, and contact between these populations revealed that there was more than one way of understanding male and female bodies. This inspired fear, entrenchment, opportunism, and curiosity in Atlantic World residents before 1820, most of whose daily lives were heavily influenced by expectations for their sex. This course will look at these reactions, and it will use the lens of gender to explore experiences like first contacts, power, religion, race, labor, and family in the early Americas. This course examines the experiences of African, European, and Indigenous individuals as their lives were shaped by gender and sexuality between 1400 and 1820. These groups increasingly came into contact during this period, and their varying expectations of how men and women should behave provided comfortable languages for understanding new situations and offered sites of acute conflict. Gender also was used by empires to govern overseas settlers. This course will look at such phenomenon, and it will use gender as the lens to explore experiences like first contacts, power, religion, race, labor, and family formation in the early Americas.

U16 Hist 3490 The Age of Extremes: A Global History of the 20th Century The 20th century, declared historian Eric Hobsbawn, was an \"age of extremes\" \u2014 of great idealism, along with brutal militarism; of humanitarian crusades, along with calculated genocide; of unprecedented prosperity, along with crushing poverty. No part of the world escaped the extremes of the century. This course will look at the big picture of social, political, cultural, and economic changes, while also considering how those changes affected individual lives. The course begins with the high point of European imperialism on the cusp of World War I and closes with our current era of economic globalization alongside religious fundamentalism. Particularly important to this course will be the ideas that shaped history and the history of the 20th century from a global perspective. Credit 3 units.

But scholars are only beginning to address the scope and character of its impact on world history. This course treats the American Civil War as a global event. It places the war to preserve the Union and end slavery in the wider context of the long 19th century, one that encompasses various histories of slavery, antislavery, capitalism, nationalism, state-building, and empire as they collectively gave birth to the modern world. As Union and Confederate troops collided, parallel contests over democracy and the rights of labor gripped Europe. Credit 3 units.

Through a selection of primary sources and secondary scholarship, this seminar will explore (and challenge) many of the attitudes, ideals and values associated with Victorian Britain. In the process, we will examine themes of reform, modernization, and periodization, and develop provisional definitions of what it meant (and means) to be \"Victorian.\" This is a fully online course.

U16 Hist 3542 Crime and Punishment in England, 1500-1800 In this course, we will study the history and cultural role of crime and punishment in early- modern England. We will examine attitudes to crime and criminality; we will also explore the relationships between laws and the people who made, broke, enforced, or selectively ignored them. The smaller size of a summer class allows for vibrant discussion, and our meetings will be built around conversation, intensive engagement with primary and secondary sources, and ongoing small-group projects that are fueled by the digital humanities. After the first two days of introduction to the topic and historical context, the course will follow a pattern that alternates assignments of academic articles or book chapters with in-class discussion of primary sources such as pamphlets, ballads, prison sermons, trial records, and illustrations. Written assessments each Friday will be followed by films; from Arden of Faversham to Moll Cutpurse, crimes and criminals had a fierce hold on the imagination of early modern authors and audiences alike, and print and theatrical culture influenced both criminal and legal practice. Through analysis and discussion of these and other primary sources, we will gain insight into the social relations, gender dynamics, power structures, religious tensions, and political dealings of early-modern England.

U16 Hist 355 Hist 3560 20th-Century Europe In 1914, several European nations dominated much of the world through vast overseas empires in which they exercised military, political, and economic power. Today, an increasingly united Europe has reemerged as a major geopolitical entity that some see as a serious challenger to American global supremacy. This course explores the decline, fall, and slow return of the \"new Europe\" by examining the history of Europe from the First World War to the present. It considers the decline of Europe brought about by two devastating wars, and the crucial impact of war and genocide in shaping European politics, society, and culture; the place of Europe in the Cold War; and the European retreat from empire in the postwar era. It also examines the development of a new idea of Europe through the formation of economic and political institutions that have created the European Union. Throughout the course, special emphasis will be placed on changing concepts of \"Europe\" and the meanings of European identity in the 20th and into the 21st century. Credit 3 units.

Much attention will be given to the assumptions and conclusions of schools of historical analysis, Marxist, totalitarian, Kremlinologist, and revisionist. Credit 3 units. U16 Hist 3564 Forbidden Sexual Practices in Medieval Europe During the middle ages, sexuality was seen as a force of evil that constantly threatened human salvation and called for severe acts of penance. Although many assume that the sexual was not much spoken of in a culture so dominated by religion, different legal, medical, political, and literary discourses not only discussed sex, but they showed particular interest in illicit sexual relations and transgressions. This course focuses on some of these discussions and particularly their treatment of the so called \"unmentionable sins\": incest, sodomy, prostitution, homosexual love, adultery, and sexual abuse. By examining a variety of literary, historical, and scientific texts, the course will explore the construction of certain forbidden sexual identities, attitudes, and practices during the medieval period, and show how \"unnatural sex\" became a preferred tool in the propoganda of religious ideals.

It is impossible fully to understand one without also studying the other. Modern liberalism became a political force during the presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, while modern conservatism emerged as a viable movement during the early Cold War years.

They were the architects of a period of rapid and profound economic growth in the United States that created networks of transcontinental railroads, huge factories and urban centers, fundamental transformations in the lives of workers and consumers, and vast fortunes. Naturally, historians' interpretations of this group and age have varied widely \u2014 were they \"captains of industry,\" as they liked to fashion themselves, or \"robber barons\"? This course will examine the rise of these industrial leaders and the age they helped create. Credit 3 units.

We will explore the forgotten, sometimes bizarre (in retrospect, often humorous) \"bodily turn\" in American memory culture from 1790 through 1840, when patriotic Americans collected historical artifacts, including bodily relics, of their country's dying Revolutionary war heroes. Topics include: African-American Revolutionary War memories; theBulletin 2017-18 University College - Undergraduate (06/27/17) 166popular science of memory in the early republic; influential theologies of memory; the pedagogy of memory; of politics to memory; and traveling \"freak shows.\" This is a fully online course.

How has the very meaning of \"forgiveness\" evolved in American history and why? Historically, how have personal experiences of forgiveness and unforgiveness been part and parcel of mass movements toward or away from acts of forgiveness in, or of, the nation? Can understanding the history of forgiveness in American culture usefully inform present efforts at forgiveness and reconciliation in American culture? Topics include: forgiveness of loyalists and of Britain after the revolution, imperfect racial and regional reconciliation after the Civil War, intergenerational tensions and forgiveness in American history, changing view concerning bankruptcy and debt forgiveness, political scandals and forgiveness, the history of \"restitution\" as an aim in the American justice system, President Ford's pardoning of President Nixon, changing divorce, and adultery laws.

The past colors the decisions we make in the present, but we rarely think about the processes by which it is researched, organized, and presented to us. This course introduces students to some of the key theories and practices of public history, while asking them to think critically about the ways historical persons, places, and events are represented in their communities. It assesses the opportunities and limitations of different types of historical places; the roles of audience, technology, and business strategy in presenting the past; and the influence of modern interests in antiquing, film, genealogy, heritage tourism, and architectural preservation/gentrification in our local and national historical conversations. Working through practical exercises that push students to think like public historians, students assess some of the most influential ways that the history-around-them shapes us and how it might still be improved.

In the years between 1919 and 1945, Americans experienced significant economic, political, and cultural change. The great wealth and excess of the Roaring '20s came to an abrupt halt with the stock market crash and the deprivation of the Great Depression. The government's restorative efforts in the '30s and America's entry into World War II led to the emergence of the U.S. as a superpower in 1945. The '20s and '30s defined the generations that lived through them and forged a modern national identity. Students will gain a better understanding of how the country was changed and modernized by these two decades. Credit 3 units.

It brought about the disintegration of four vast empires and seriously undermined the stability of two others. At the same time, World War I confirmed the arrival of the United States onto the world stage and re-drew the political and territorial frontiers of central and southeast Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Pacific. We will place the First World War in a global context, examining it from social, political, economic, and military viewpoints, and consider its continuing legacy into the 21st century.

It will begin with the annexation crisis of 1908 and conclude with the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923. In addition, there will be an epilogue on the origins of World War II. By 1923, no less than four of Europe's great empires had gone the way of all flesh, and revolutionary fervor was in the air from Bavaria to Siberia. A new political order rose on the ashes of the old, an order that planted the seeds for the next epic struggle that began in September of 1939. Recent scholarship has brought to light many fascinating details about WWI that necessitate a rewriting of accepted orthodoxy.

The issues raised in the book continue to interest scholars to this day. Is there really no socialism in America? Has there ever been? Is Europe better suited for socialism? Is there something \"un-American\" about it, as the right still argues? Are the lack of welfare legislation and nationalized health care, for example, signs that socialism has \"failed\"?

Because women played crucial roles, of course, as consumers, but also as retailers and producers, an understanding of women's history is central to any account of the rise of the first modern economy. This was no pre-industrial \"golden age\" of women's work: patriarchal institutions and misogynistic prejudice severely constricted women's economic opportunities throughout the period. This course explores the lives of ordinary working women, and the ways in which those women found accommodation with or resisted patriarchal authority and economic change. Credit 3 units.

Important points of focus are antisemitism, the Nazi world view, and the examination of pivotal events on the path to the \"Final Solution.\" We will also address a number of significant debates in the historical literature about the Holocaust. Was Nazism a \"political religion\"? Should we compare the Holocaust to other genocides, or was it a historically unique event? Can or should we consider the Holocaust as an event separate from the Second World War? To what extent did antisemitism factor in the actions and beliefs of perpetrators of violence against Jews? How deep did support for Hitler and the Nazis run among the Germanpopulace? For example, did intellectuals legitimize the anti- Jewish policies of the regime? Did the Enlightenment lead initially to the emancipation of Jews in Europe and yet more than a century later result in their dehumanization and murder? To what degree did German Protestants and Catholics, who together represented nearly 95 percent of the German populace, support Nazi policies? Can the evil perpetrated by the Nazis be considered \"banal\"? The course will incorporate a historical approach that is significantly informed by other disciplines, including sociology and religion. We will seek to achieve historical literacy about the Holocaust and attempt to consider this seemingly unfathomable series of events as part of a broader investigation of history. Credit 3 units.

Should history aspire to be like science, or are its methods, goals, and subject matter entirely different?

U16 Europe 1815-1914 U16 Hist 4921 Decoding the City While architecture and infrastructure are worthy of study in themselves, often they signify more complex cultural meanings, mask efforts to erase or reorder the city, and conceal histories of injustice. This course presents methods for \"reading\" the built form of the American city to decode histories of architecture, culture, public policy and economics. City space can be read literally, but this course will unpack the symbolic meanings of urban spaces, neighborhoods, buildings and sites. Students will undertake readings that will present methods for understanding and analyzing the city's form, before delving into a specific case study of the Mill Creek Valley. As St. Louis' largest African-American neighborhood, but almost completely erased between 1959 and 1965 using city and federal funds, the site of the neighborhood remains a potent and under-examined part of St. Louis. The course will examine the history of the neighborhood as well as related histories of federal and local urban renewal policies, African-American cultural history and historic preservation. Research into the neighborhood will include experiences at local archives where students will learn toattain and apply primary source documents vital to urban history including Census records, building permits, municipal ordinances and insurance maps. Additional readings will offer insights into possible methods for interpreting and commemorating places that illuminate the urban built environment's historic past. The final project in this course will entail students collaboratively working on a public interpretive project for Mill Creek Valley where they can apply both methods of decoding and curating the city.

Because in America we follow a Western trajectory of thought, many of the courses herein are Western. However, the goal of our work together is to compare and contrast how different cultures have theorized and created works with/about/concerning: birth, death, religion, self-image, the cosmos, ethics, love, etc., in various forms including but not limited to: drama, poetry, epics, folklore, and various mythoi, in such a way that we must consider printing, translation, court behavior, local (and aesthetic) boundaries, visual documents, etc.; in short, we will frame our look at various cultures' oral and written works so as to form an idea of how and why literature has worked and is capable of working. Our work together will result in all of us becoming better readers, more alert to variations on themes, vital differences, intuitive comparisons, the limits oflogic (and of poorly deployed rhetoric), and the vitally important specifics of works that make them all but impenetrable.

Often treated as figures with no political vision or power, black and indigenous people were long relegated to the margins of our understandings of history. However, recent works have shown how these very people engaged with revolutionary ideas, challenged their enslavement, and expanded the meaning of what it meant to be a citizen, thereby playing a fundamental role in the shaping of colonial and modern Latin America and the Caribbean.

UColl: PSI U43 IS 306 The Modern Mediterranean: Facts and Fictions The countries and cultures around the entire Mediterranean basin have provided, and have been the scene of, much of the world's recorded history. In the 20th century, however, writers set out to explore, either by actual travel or else in their imagination alone, many of its lesser known corners: forgotten imperial ruins in Tunisia; remote and semi-primitive mountain villages of Crete; dusty and disease ridden towns in the Sahara; the secretive souks of Alexandria. In doing so, they often found many fascinating, if previously hidden places, peoples, behaviors and customs, or sometimes instead, simple symbolic fodder for an oftentimes implied critique of their own native lands and social mores. In this course, we shall consider examples of the former in works like Andre Gide's Immoralist , Nikos Kazantzakis' Zorba the Sheltering Sky and Lawrence Durrell's Justine. As for the latter, our attention will turn to even more contemporary works, such as Derek Walcott's Omeros, which is partially based on the Homeric tale of Ulysses' wanderings around the Mediterranean, but which aims primarily at questioning the history of colonialism and cultural memory of his own Caribbean island of Saint Lucia. While students will pay attention to the stylistic features of these works, to understand better the role rhetoric plays in such fiction, they will also study closely the various important sociopolitical, economic, religious and philosophical concerns raised by their authors.

U43 IS 307 Latin American Migrations Latin America has been, historically, a region defined by its migrations. Throughout its history, Latin America has received waves of immigrants from around the world and has been the site both of internal migrations (country to city and country to country) and a considerable diaspora that has created new communities in the United States and Europe. Through theBulletin 2017-18 University College - Undergraduate (06/27/17) 191reading of scholarship, fiction, film, art, and memoirs, this class seeks to study the cultural impact that different waves of migration have had both on the establishment of political and imaginary borders and in the constitution of new national, regional and transnational identities. The class will approach case studies that encompass the effect of internal migrations in the region (such as the racial politics of Andean immigration to Argentina), the social redefinitions of Latin American countries due to new waves of immigrants (such as the increasing Asian immigration to Panama), the articulation of a Latin America in exile and the construction of new \"Latino\" identities in the United States and Europe. Through these case studies, students will not only get snapshots of different \"Latin American Crossings.\" The class will also tackle the question of new, fluid notions of Latin American culture and identity, as well as changing notions of race, ethnicity, class and gender, as they are being redefined in the contemporary world.

U43 IS 3081 Looking East, Looking West: Stereotypes & Misconceptions in the Exchange between China and the West This course explores the misconceptions, mutual ignorance and arrogance, and the stereotypes in the exchange between China and the West in general and China and the United States in particular. We will read some seminal works theorizing the problems of cross-cultural communication and the question of the Other. China's exchange with the West will be seen not only theoretically, but also historically. We will read Chinese works concerned with the West and Western writings on China. We will watch movies devoted to the problems of understanding and adapting to a foreign culture. In analyzing the works, we will ask how the images of China and the West created in these works relate to prevalent clich\u00e9s in China's interchange with the West. Our goal will be to develop sensitivity to the way in which cultural heritage and political ideology shape the perceptions of the Other.

We begin with such authors as Fyodor Dostoevsky and Yevgeny Zamyatin, and then move on to examine the ways in which later authors, such as Ray Bradbury and George Orwell, interpreted the pressing current events of their times \u2014 the Cold War, the rise of technology and bio-technology, and the ecological crisis \u2014 through the dystopian lens, with an emphasis on the role that Russia and Russian literature played in the development of this particular mindset. We will extend our exploration to include recent dystopian ideas prevalent in China and Latin America, as well as to address the popularity of such multimillion dollar media franchises as The Hunger Games and The Maze Runner .

In contrast, its critics focus on how cultural globalization imposes Western values on others and destroys their traditions, religious beliefs, and identities, and how it enables terrorists to move easily from one country to another. The class will explore these issues and evaluate their weight and validity. Credit 3 units. U43 IS 326 The Doctor Is In: Anton Chekhov and Narrative Medicine Anton Chekhov was one of the greatest Russian writers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was also a successful practicing physician. How did he manage to balance both of these full-time careers? How did being a trained physician affect his writing and how did being a writer affect his medical practice? Why did he emerge as arguably the most influential short story writer of the 20th century? Did being a doctor and scientist have anything to do with this, or did he achieve success in spite of having a second career? Understanding the ways in which Chekhov was able to integrate and express cultural attitudes toward illness, mortality, medicine, and healing at a time of great change and social upheaval will be the subject of this class. Equally important will be applying some of his wisdom and techniques to understanding our own current cultural narratives about medicine, as both an ideal and a real practice. Credit 3 units.

U43 IS 3564 Forbidden Sexual Practices in Medieval Europe During the middle ages, sexuality was seen as a force of evil that constantly threatened human salvation and called for severe acts of penance. Although many assume that the sexual was not much spoken of in a culture so dominated by religion, different legal, medical, political, and literary discourses not only discussed sex, but they showed particular interest in illicit sexual relations and transgressions. This course focuses on some of these discussions and particularly their treatment of the so called \"unmentionable sins\": incest, sodomy, prostitution, homosexual love, adultery, and sexual abuse. By examining a variety of literary, historical, and scientific texts, the course will explore the construction of certain forbidden sexual identities, attitudes, and practices during the medieval period, and show how \"unnatural sex\" became a preferred tool in the propoganda of religious ideals.

U43 IS 368 Confronting Weapons of Mass Destruction: New Developments and Challenges International Studies students come to grips with the global Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) problem. They encounter the specter of acquisition and use of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and their respective means of delivery not only by sovereign states but also by terrorists and other non-state actors. They examine and assess the viability of states' current individual and collective anti-WMD policies and strategies. In that light they seek comprehensive answers to the following questions: Is nuclear deterrence obsolete? How much nuclear-weapons modernization is enough? Will the nuclear nonproliferation regime survive? If so, under what conditions? Is the Iran Nuclear Deal viable? How can North Korea's WMD threat be diminished? Is nuclear security attainable? How can chemical and biological weapons threats be successfully addressed? Why are counterproliferation strategies necessary complements to nonproliferation strategies? Why is ballistic- missile defense a prime counterproliferation strategy? What cyberchallenges must be addressed in the anti-WMD/WMD nonproliferation realm? In light of the responses to the foregoing questions, what is the future for global WMD control/elimination? Credit 3 units. UColl: OLH, OLI U43 IS 3682 The Cold War and the Modern Spy This course studies the Cold War through the lens of modern espionage. We begin by studying how technology developed in World War I, such as the use of codes and code-breaking machines, enabled the growth of intelligence organizations with the goal of collecting information against the Germans. World War II spawned a new age of electronic surveillance, spies and counterspies, as tensions increased between democratic and communist allies. We will examine the creation of the CIA and KGB; NATO and the Warsaw Pact; the use of secret tunnels; aerial and satellite reconnaissance; embedded spies and moles; the \"Atomic Spy\"; and the use of military intelligence in government covert activities.

UColl: NWU43 IS 3840 Modern European Art in Context, c. 1850-1950 When displayed against pristine white gallery walls, modern art may seem detached from everyday reality. However, modern artists responded strongly to the drastic technological, social, economic, political and cultural changes that transformed Europe from 1850-1950. The period between the revolutions of c. 1848 and the end of World War II, therefore, witnessed the rapid development of new artistic styles and movements. This course considers movements ranging from Realism, Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, Expressionism, Cubism, Dada, Surrealism to the Bauhaus. By practicing careful visual analysis of artworks \u2014 including painting, printmaking, photography, sculpture and architecture \u2014 and weighing the historical contexts in which they were created, it aims to clarify the relationship between modernist aesthetics and modern life.

With the understanding that the term \"Latin America\" is a geopolitical construct that has been applied to a region of tremendous ethnic, historical, economic, and linguistic diversity, this class will focus on a selection of significant artistic movements and historical figures in and of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela, as well as major architectural projects in Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela. Artistic and architectural discourses have often played an important role in processes of modern state formation in the region, and we will be especially attentive to cases in which artists and architects worked (at least initially) in the service of governmental regimes \u2014 as in Mexican muralism in the 1920s and the construction of Bras\u00edlia, a new national capital for Brazil, in the 1950s \u2014 as well as those cases in which artworks and artistic networks offered a means of challenging or subverting official repression in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, and Mexico. Beyond politics, we will focus on the tensions \u2014 indigenous vs. cosmopolitan, urban vs. rural, rich vs. poor \u2014 and transnational dialogues that have informed the production and reception of art and architecture in Latin America.

Because women played crucial roles of course as consumers, but also as retailers and producers, an understanding of women's history is central to any account of the rise of the first modern economy. This was no pre-industrial \"golden age\" of women's work: patriarchal institutions and misogynistic prejudice severly constricted women's economic opportunities throughout the period. This course explores the lives of ordinary working women, and the ways in which those women found accomodation with or resisted patriarchal authority and economic change.

Have you ever wondered why the Parthenon (Elgin) Marbles are in the British Museum and not in Athens? Or why the beautiful bust of Nefertiti resides in Berlin and not in Cairo? Pitting museums, dealers, and private collectors against source nations, archaeologists, and academics, ownership of the world's cultural heritage is one of the most serious and controversial issues facing the art world today. Looted or plundered artifacts from the distant past are increasingly vetted for undocumented provenance as source nations implement reclamation policies intended to repatriate cultural property to its native land. This course explores the legal, ethical, philosophical and overlapping issues surrounding the sensitive yet provocative subject of cultural patrimony while examining the complex history of specific works in question. Case studies include debated artifacts from Greece, Egypt, Italy, Iraq, and Native America. Students analyze the impact of modern nation political motivations and ramifications in light of the 1970 UNESCO Convention and Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990/2010, and are encouraged to use critical inquiry in evaluating the implications for future global access to this common heritage of the world.

As a region frequently characterized as endemically prone to violence, it is vital to analyze and contextualize the violence. Approaching violence in Central America from a geographic perspective involves not only locating and \"placing\" the violence, but also thinking relationally about the multiple, overlapping scales of activity, both within and beyond the region. The course is divided into five parts. In the first two sections of the course, we begin with an overview of the physical and human geography of the region and outline key historic moments and their legacies, including colonization, international relations (with an emphasis on U.S. interventions), civil war, genocide and torture. Simultaneously, we delve into various theoretical approaches for understanding the nature of multiple types of violence. In the third section of the course, we focus on neoliberal violence, insecurity and development and address issues such as urbanization, violent crime, issues with free trade and labor, and environmental issues. For the final two sections, we draw from contemporary case studies in the region (reading four required books). We will address identity and violence (discussing indigenous issues, racism, genocide and gender) and in the last section we will cover migration, gangs, drug-trafficking, U.S. security responses, and re-militarization. While we will continue to consider these types of violence through the various theoretical frameworks introduced in the first part of the course, we will also examine and analyze reports on contemporary violence and policy recommendations from multiple sources (multilateral organizations, governments, think tanks, and other nongovernmental organizations). Throughout the course we will also discuss current events occurring in Central America and how they directly or indirectly relate to the topic of geographies of violence.

A&S: NS A&S IQ: NSM Political Science The Department of Political Science offers students the opportunity to study all aspects of politics using cutting-edge technical and theoretical tools. Our courses are animated by longstanding problems related to the use of power, its rightful exercise by governments and individual actors, and the institutions that affect how that power is exercised. Reflecting the breadth of the discipline, we offer a range of classes, including courses on elections and electoral politics, international political economy, justice and the state, and comparative analyses of political institutions across states. A major in political science thus exposes students to the primary themes of the discipline: American politics, comparative politics, international politics, political methodology, and political theory. A political science major offers students the opportunity to study political life as part of a broad liberal education. It is a useful step toward law or business school. Other political science students pursue careers or further education in public administration, urban planning, journalism, education, and social work, or in federal, state, or local government.Contact: Justin E.

U25 PolSci 101 American Politics This course provides an overview of the politics of American government. The topics covered are the historical developments of American politics, federalism, political participation (e.g., voting), institutions (e.g., Congress), and public opinion. That political actors are strategic in their pursuit of objectives is a theme underlying our examination of these topics. Accordingly, we explore the many ways in which strategic political behavior impacts institutions and the interactions between political actors in the U.S. Credit 3 units.Bulletin 2017-18 University College - Undergraduate (06/27/17) 209U25 PolSci 102 Comparative Politics One of the primary goals of a course in comparative politics is to familiarize students with a broad array of political systems. The approach taken in this course can best be characterized as the active acquisition and use of a set of tools for looking at the political world. In other words, instead of putting emphasis on what textbook writers think political scientists know, in this course the emphasis is on \"how we know what we know\" and on building knowledge. This approach equips students with a set of tools to use long after the course is over. These comparative tools are focused on historical, recent, and current events, and students are provided the opportunity to delve more deeply into a study of the parts of the world most they find most interesting. Credit 3 units. A&S IQ: LCD Art: SSC BU: BA, IS UColl: NW PolSci 103 Introduction to International Politics This course intoduces the study of world politics and approaches political scientists use to understand international political relations. We will mostly use events of the 20th century as a backdrop to know what occurred. Why these events occurred is more difficult to understand.

These federal agencies (including, for example, the Department of Agriculture, FDA, Department of Education, EPA, and Department of Homeland Security) have huge (and often overlooked) policymaking roles in our country. A reoccurring question throughout theBulletin 2017-18 University College - Undergraduate (06/27/17) 212course will be whether or not agencies have a democratic deficiency given their great policymaking authority but lack of a link to a constituency. We will pay particular attention to the President's, Congress's, and the judiciary's power and control (or lack thereof) over these agencies. We will also focus on how agencies use adjudication and rulemaking to effectuate their policies. Credit 3 units.

U19 SUST 420 History of American Architecture \"The perennial architectural debate has always been, and will continue to be, about art versus use, visions versus pragmatism, aesthetics versus social responsibility. In the end, these unavoidable conflicts provide architecture's essential and productive tensions; the tragedy is that so little of it rises above the level imposed by compromise, and that this is the only work most of us see and know.\" \u2014Ada Louise Huxtable. This course examines the ideological, political, economic and social determinants that have shaped the look of AmericanBulletin 2017-18 University College - Undergraduate (06/27/17) 236architecture. Starting with a thorough survey of the historic development of American architecture pursued in a chronological reading of styles, forms, and major architects, the course examines key tensions in the development of American architecture. Students will undertake readings, site visits, and discussions that probe whether there is a distinctly American mode of creating architecture, and what contingencies illuminate or obscure that mode. The central questions of this course: What are the definitive characteristics of American architecture? Does the American practice of architecture espouse an exceptionalism, or does it emulate international precedents (or both)? Do the characteristics of American architecture reveal the social, economic, and political structures of its production? Ultimately, can we read an American building to reveal sense of national identity, individual political agency, the evolution of gender roles, the assertion of disciplinary and economic power, and the evolution of the American artistic sensibility? This course fulfills the Humanities and Fine Arts distribution requirement for the AMCS master's program.

Classes will feature hands-on exercises selected to help students master advanced GIS analysis tools and techniques, while providing experience in the planning and execution of real-world projects. Primary emphasis will be on applying fundamental GIS concepts, performing spatial analysis, developing proficiency with core ArcGIS software (e.g., Network Analyst extension), resolution of problems, and efficient delivery of results. Readings from books and scientific literature will introduce key concepts and provide real-world examples that will be reinforced in the hands-on exercises, assignments, and projects. As the semester develops, students will gain a variety of new tools and techniques that will allow them to complete a final independent project that integrates the material learned during the course. Same as L82 Decoding the City While architecture and infrastructure are worthy of study in themselves, often they signify more complex cultural meanings, mask efforts to erase or reorder the city, and conceal histories of injustice. This course presents methods for \"reading\" the built form of the American city to decode histories of architecture, culture, public policy and economics. City space can be read literally, but this course will unpack the symbolic meanings of urban spaces, neighborhoods, buildings and sites. Students will undertake readings that will present methods for understanding and analyzing the city's form, before delving into a specific case study of the Mill Creek Valley. As St. Louis' largestAfrican-American neighborhood, but almost completely erased between 1959 and 1965 using city and federal funds, the site of the neighborhood remains a potent and under-examined part of St. Louis. The course will examine the history of the neighborhood as well as related histories of federal and local urban renewal policies, African-American cultural history and historic preservation. Research into the neighborhood will include experiences at local archives where students will learn to attain and apply primary source documents vital to urban history including Census records, building permits, municipal ordinances and insurance maps. Additional readings will offer insights into possible methods for interpreting and commemorating places that illuminate the urban built environment's historic past. The final project in this course will entail students collaboratively working on a public interpretive project for Mill Creek Valley where they can apply both methods of decoding and curating the city. This course satisfies the Humanities and Social Science requirement for the master's program in American Culture Studies. Same as U89 AMCS 492 Credit 3 units.

Each student will take five 3- credit, advanced-level (300 or higher) courses, including three courses devoted to mastering the craft of writing in the chosenBulletin 2017-18 University College - Undergraduate (06/27/17) 239specialty genre, one course primarily in reading and analysis of the literature in that genre, and one course in a second genre. The student's final course in the program will be taken for 4 credits, rather than the usual 3, and will include a 1-credit meta- commentary assignment. This assignment requires students to step back from the particular course and describe (in 1500 words) what they have learned about the differences between and similarities among the genres investigated and how these have affected their choice of genre. Students should look at the strategies they have chosen in their writing and explain why they chose them for a particular purpose. The purpose of this assignment is for students to show the skills that they have learned in the course of the certificate as they think about the genres they have examined, and how these skills govern their approach to creative writing. Students with little previous experience in creative writing are encouraged to begin with a 200-level writing course or workshop as a foundation for the more advanced courses that will count toward the certificate.

The New Journalists made immersion journalism \u2014 in short, hanging out with one's subject \u2014 a mainstay of narrative nonfiction practice, but the tradition of the writer inserting herself into the story goes back much further, and comes in many forms. We'll read five books written by journalists who both create and observe their subject matter, considering themes of objectivity, purpose, access, and ethics. Students will brainstorm and execute a brief \"stunt\" reporting project during the course of the term. Books covered include: Ten Days in a Mad-House by Nellie Bly, 1887; Black Like Me by John Howard Griffin, 1961; Rolling Nowhere by Ted Conover, 1984; Nickel and Dimed: On Not Getting By in America by Barbara Ehrenreich (2001) and Self-Made Man: One Woman's Year Disguised as a Man by Laura Vincent (2006). U11 EComp 336 Body of Work: Somatic Writing Writing unfolds along the edge of the inner and outer world. And writing is also an edge-dweller in terms of theory and praxis, as it is an investigative process rooted in the sensing/experiencing body. There is increasing attention to the body in scholarship as well as a growing general interest in skilled and trained ways of experiencing. This class will be a mixed-genre composition course (foregrounding poems, but including flash fiction and creative nonfiction) built upon the idea of writing as a process of embodied critical thinking. We will enliven the understanding and practice of our medium by regarding the page as a performance/ heightened space and the word as sound and gesture. Writing exercises will be complemented with practices adapted from principles of master teachers such as Eugene Gendlin, F.M. Alexander, choreographer Liz Lerman, and composer Pauline Oliveros. These prompts will be modified for writers, with a focus on honing and deepening attention to forms, movements, and patterns both on and off the page. Credit 3 units.

We will read exemplary long-form magazine journalism \u2014 sometimes called literary journalism or narrative nonfiction \u2014 with an eye to process and craft. How do we find stories? What is the relationship between reporting and the published piece? How do we shed new light on common themes and approach storytelling in innovative ways? During the term, each student will develop a feature profile: securing a subject, devising a reporting strategy, incorporating research, and ultimately, exploring voice, theme, and structure through multiple drafts. The course will include literary analysis and discussion, writing exercises, workshop- style discussion of student work, and will prepare interested students to pitch their stories for publication.

U11 EComp 341 Writing the Documentary Lyric This course explores American culture through poetic accounts that focus on the personal experience of social issues ranging from ecological crisis, consumer culture, race, labor, war, and autobiography as coextensive with local history. Students will blend research with creative writing, reading exemplary texts (such as Birdlovers, Backyard ; Giscombe Road ; Citizen; Port of Los Angeles ; Shut Up, Shut Down ; and 100 Notes on Violence ) while producing their own creative work. The readings and writings will be focused on documentary writing which incorporates quotations from daily life, the news, films, diaries, public documents, and maps. The readings studied are \"lyric\" instead of journalistic, following a poetic approach that connects inner experience and outer event, intimate and distant occurrences, people and places, private and public life. Students will engage in weekly creative-writing exercises while developing a final research-based creative-writing project. The course will include conversations with some of our books' authors, who will offer insights into their processes of cultural research grounded in personal experience and language-conscious cultural critique. This course will count toward the major in American culture studies for day students. This course fulfills the Art distribution requirement for the AMCS MA program. Same as U89 AMCS 413 Credit UColl: ACF U11 EComp 354 The Lyric I: Truth and Lie One of the biggest misconceptions that readers of poetry may have is that the poet is the same individual as the speaker of the poem. In this course, The Lyric I: Truth and Lie, we will investigate examples of modern and contemporary American poetry which utilize the first-person speaker, to more thoroughly understand how and why these poems blur the boundaries between autobiography, history, and imagination. The collections of poetry we will read this semester are as follows: Kaddish, Allen Ginsberg's semi-autobiographical elegy for his mother, Naomi; the restored edition of Ariel, Sylvia Plath's confessional poems which incorporate historical references to World War II; the first 77 Dream Songs , John Berryman's alter-ego persona poems; Don't Let Me Be Lonely , Claudia Rankine's extended lyric essay which addresses social issues in post-9/11 America; Wind in a Box , Terrance Hayes' exploration Master Letters , Lucie Brock-Broido's continuation of the voice of Emily Dickinson's Master Letters; and Autobiography of Red , Anne Carson's contemporary queer adaptation of the Greek myth of Geryon and Herakles. These poems encompass the contradictions of the human mind, and lay them out, irresolvable and inseparable \u2014 genuine \u2014 on the page. Students will be responsible for a comparative essay of 10-15 pages in length, in which they discuss and contrast two poets' approaches to the first-person speaker. In addition, students will be responsible for 8-10 pages of original creative work which uses the first person speaker, drawing inspiration from poetics we discuss in class; as well as a 2-3 page response paper to challenges encountered during this creative writing process, and how those challenges were overcome.

U19 SUST 420 History of American Architecture \"The perennial architectural debate has always been, and will continue to be, about art versus use, visions versus pragmatism, aesthetics versus social responsibility. In the end, these unavoidable conflicts provide architecture's essential and productive tensions; the tragedy is that so little of it rises above the level imposed by compromise, and that this is the only work most of us see and know.\" \u2014Ada Louise Huxtable. This course examines the ideological, political, economic and social determinants that have shaped the look of American architecture. Starting with a thorough survey of the historic development of American architecture pursued in a chronological reading of styles, forms, and major architects, the course examines key tensions in the development of American architecture. Students will undertake readings, site visits, and discussions that probe whether there is a distinctly American mode of creating architecture, and what contingencies illuminate or obscure that mode. The central questions of this course: What are the definitive characteristics of American architecture? Does the American practice of architecture espouse an exceptionalism, or does it emulate international precedents (orBulletin 2017-18 University College - Undergraduate (06/27/17) 255both)? Do the characteristics of American architecture reveal the social, economic, and political structures of its production? Ultimately, can we read an American building to reveal sense of national identity, individual political agency, the evolution of gender roles, the assertion of disciplinary and economic power, and the evolution of the American artistic sensibility? This course fulfills the Humanities and Fine Arts distribution requirement for the AMCS master's program.

Classes will feature hands-on exercises selected to help students master advanced GIS analysis tools and techniques, while providing experience in the planning and execution of real-world projects. Primary emphasis will be on applying fundamental GIS concepts, performing spatial analysis, developing proficiency with core ArcGIS software (e.g., Network Analyst extension), resolution of problems, and efficient delivery of results. Readings from books and scientific literature will introduce key concepts and provide real-world examples that will be reinforced in the hands-on exercises, assignments, and projects. As the semester develops, students will gain a variety of new tools and techniques that will allow them to complete a final independent project that integrates the material learned during the course. Same as L82 Decoding the City While architecture and infrastructure are worthy of study in themselves, often they signify more complex cultural meanings, mask efforts to erase or reorder the city, and conceal histories of injustice. This course presents methods for \"reading\" the built form of the American city to decode histories of architecture, culture, public policy and economics. City space can be read literally, but this course will unpack the symbolic meanings of urban spaces, neighborhoods, buildings and sites. Students will undertake readings that will present methods for understanding and analyzing the city's form, before delving into a specific case study of the Mill Creek Valley. As St. Louis' largest African-American neighborhood, but almost completely erased between 1959 and 1965 using city and federal funds, the site of the neighborhood remains a potent and under-examined part of St. Louis. The course will examine the history of the neighborhood as well as related histories of federal and local urban renewal policies, African-American cultural history and historic preservation. Research into the neighborhood will include experiences at local archives where students will learn to attain and apply primary source documents vital to urban history including Census records, building permits, municipal ordinances and insurance maps. Additional readings will offer insights intopossible methods for interpreting and commemorating places that illuminate the urban built environment's historic past. The final project in this course will entail students collaboratively working on a public interpretive project for Mill Creek Valley where they can apply both methods of decoding and curating the city.

The scale and grade points per unit of academic credit for each letter grade are as follows: Grade Points per Unit A+ 4.0 A 4.0 A- 3.7 B+ 3.3 B 3.0 B- 2.7 C+ 2.3C 2.0 C- 1.7 D+ 1.3 D 1.0 D- 0.7 F 0.0 CR Credit awarded, but work was not subjected to more precise evaluation NCR No credit/student's work was not satisfactory N No grade received by the Registrar's Office by the grading deadline I Incomplete/semester's work not finished, including failure to complete final exam W Withdrawal/student withdrew from course prior to completion R Repeat/course has been retaken S Satisfactory, used almost exclusively for semester hours earned for research L Audit/student satisfactorily audited the course throughout the semester Z Audit/student did not satisfactorily audit the course These grading policies apply to all University College courses. Only courses taken for a letter grade may be applied to a graduate program of study. Courses taken as Pass/Fail or Audit will not count toward a graduate program of study. Grades below C- will not count toward a graduate program of study. Students are responsible for knowing the specific grading criteria and course requirements set by individual instructors. Grades are posted online at the end of the semester. No grades are given by telephone or orally in the office. Students may choose among four grading options at the time of registration: a letter grade, Credit/No Credit (also referred to as Pass/Fail), Audit, or Special Audit. Changes from one option to another must be made by the dates indicated in the calendar printed each semester in the University College Course Schedule and on our website (http://ucollege.wustl.edu/calendar/ upcoming?field_event_tags_tid=6) . Students must select the grade option at the time of registration, and any changes must be made according to the dates published in the semester Course Schedule. Grade option changes are not permitted after a semester is over. The Credit/No Credit option, available for certain courses, allows students to enroll in courses on a Pass/Fail basis. Under this option, students receive credit for courses satisfactorily completed, but a grade is not assigned or calculated in the student's cumulative grade point average. The standards for receiving Credit are at the discretion of each individual instructor. Undergraduate degree candidates may enroll in no more than 10 percent of their credits taken at Washington University under this option. Courses intended to satisfy the basic and advancedBulletin 2017-18 Academic Policies (06/27/17) 267writing requirements for the Associate in Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees, courses in the major and minor, and courses specific to a graduate degree or any certificate are excluded from the Credit/No Credit option. Graduate schools and current employers may require specific letter grades rather than Credit only. A specific grade may also be required as a prerequisite for more advanced course work in that subject area. A few courses particularly designated by departments may require enrollment on a Credit/No Credit basis, in which case the course would not be included in the 10 percent limit. The Audit grade may be chosen if a student wishes to have the registration and grade for a course recorded on an official transcript, but does not seek academic credit for the course. Students must meet the requirements established by the instructor to successfully audit a course. As an auditor, normally students are required to attend and participate in a course, but are not required to complete all written assignments and examinations. The Special Audit is offered only for a selected number of University College courses in the fall and spring semesters. Courses taken as Special Audit will not appear on a Washington University transcript, and a grade report is not issued. Courses taken on a Special Audit basis do not carry academic credit and do not apply to degree requirements in a University College program of study. Special auditors attend lectures and discussions, but are not required to complete written work. A grade of I (Incomplete) indicates that the instructor has agreed to withhold a final grade pending the completion of a small portion of required work normally due at the end of a semester. Students experiencing a medical or personal problem that makes timely completion of course work difficult or unlikely may request a grade of Incomplete from the instructor prior to the end of the semester. If the instructor consents, an Incomplete Agreement form must be completed. Sixty days after the end of a semester, a grade of Incomplete without an Incomplete Agreement form will be converted to F. For undergraduate students, if the work is not completed within a period of one calendar year the grade of I will be changed to F. For graduate students, if the work is not completed within a period of one calendar year, the grade of I will remain a permanent grade. Future enrollment may be withheld for University College students who have accumulated more than 9 units of incomplete work within the previous two years. A grade of N indicates that no grade has been received by the Registrar's Office by the grading deadline. Sixty days after the end of a semester, a grade of N will be converted to F. Continuing Master's Research is the only exception to the above policy, in which case the permanent grade is N. Transfer Credit University College will accept undergraduate transfer credits from other accredited institutions for courses that are comparable to those offered at Washington University. Transfercredit may satisfy distribution requirements of University College and may fulfill a portion of the major requirements. A maximum of 84 units may be transferred for the Bachelor of Science degree; a maximum of 66 units will be accepted from a junior or community college. A maximum of 24 units may be transferred for the Associate in Arts degree. No more than 6 units may be transferred into a graduate degree program in University College. Transfer credit will not be given for internships and independent studies, nor will it be given for grades below C- received at other institutions. A maximum of 30 units in transfer credit for online courses may be awarded for University College approved course work from other appropriately accredited institutions. The combined total number of units accepted in transfer credit for online courses, College-Level Examination Program, Advanced Placement, and International Baccalaureate may not exceed 30. Transfer credit for study abroad must be preapproved by University College and the Office for International Students and Scholars. Students who receive a grade of C- or lower in EComp 101 Principles of Writing taken at University College must repeat the course. Students who receive a grade of C- or lower in EComp 203 Critical and Researched Writing taken at University College must, in consultation with the Department of English and University College, choose between two options to satisfy the requirement: 1) repeat the course; or 2) complete a 3-unit composition tutorial with a grade of C or higher. Transfer credit for EComp 101 Principles of Writing may be granted for a grade of B or higher. EComp 203 Critical and Researched Writing and the 300-level or higher advanced writing requirement are required of all undergraduate degree candidates, and these courses must be taken at Washington University with a grade of C of higher. Students may still receive transfer credit for a second-level basic writing course; however, that will count as elective credit and they still will be required to take EComp 203 Critical and Researched Writing. A student who transfers English Composition courses from another college or university must consult an academic adviser at University College, who will provide options for completing requirements. To receive transfer credit, a student must be admitted to a University College degree or certificate program and submit official transcripts from all institutions previously attended. All records must be in English. International records must be evaluated for transfer credit by an accredited transcript evaluation agency. Advisers will evaluate transcripts to determine transfer credit and remaining course requirements toward a University College degree or certificate. Advanced Courses Students must complete a minimum of 30 units of advanced (300-400) courses at Washington University in order to receive the Bachelor of Science degree.Bulletin 2017-18 Academic Policies (06/27/17) 268Overlap Policy If a student has two majors, each major's upper-level units of credit must be independent of the other (i.e., no double counting of upper-level units required for the majors is permitted). Prerequisite courses at the 100- or 200-levels may count for both majors. Should the same upper-level course satisfy a requirement in more than one of a student's major programs, a departmentally sanctioned upper-level elective must be chosen to replace the course in one of the programs. If a student has a major and a minor, all course work applied to the minor must be independent of the major. No overlap is permitted. Major or minor course work may be applied to distribution requirements for general education. If a student is pursuing a bachelor's degree and a certificate, all courses applied toward the certificate must be independent of the major. No overlap is permitted. (The exception to this restriction on certificates applies to sequential programs of the same name, in which case all certificate courses may apply to the next-level program.) A single course can count toward any two of the following categories: 1) major requirements; 2) basic requirements for numerical applications or non-Western culture; 3) distribution requirements. Residency Requirement The final 36 units of course work toward the Associate in Arts degree or the Bachelor of Science degree must be completed at Washington University. At least half of the credits for the concentration (Associate in Arts) or major (Bachelor of Science) must be completed at Washington University. Students with a gap in their studies at University College for more than 10 years are required to meet the 36-unit residency requirement upon return. Fully online and blended online courses taught at Washington University will count toward the residency requirement in University College. Repeating a Course Students may repeat a course in which a grade of D or F was received (including 100- to 200-level courses with University College authorization), in which case only the most recent grade will be included in calculating the student's grade point average. Departmental permission is required. All enrollments will appear on the student's transcript, but the symbol \"R\" will replace the earlier grade for a repeated course if the grade in the second enrollment is equal to or higher than the grade in the first enrollment. A course may be repeated only once for credit. Satisfactory Academic Progress, Academic Probation, and Suspension To remain in good academic standing, an undergraduate student must maintain a 2.0 grade point average, a graduate student must maintain a 3.0 grade point average, and all certificate students must maintain a 3.0 grade point average. Additionally, in considering good academic standing, University College maytake into account the extent to which a student's educational and professional goals are consistent with the aims of the program to which the student is admitted. A student whose previous semester's work is unsatisfactory, or whose cumulative record is unsatisfactory, or who has a history of failure to complete course work without adequate reason may be placed on academic probation. Students placed on academic probation are not in good academic standing. Probationary status serves to warn a student who is not making satisfactory progress. Unless the quality of work improves during the next semester, a student may be suspended or dismissed from the program and future enrollment may not be allowed. University College reserves the right to cancel the registration of students who have been placed on academic suspension or dismissed. Subsequent re-admission will be determined on an individual basis. Intent to Graduate and Commencement All degree and certificate candidates must complete the Intent to Graduate form before their last semester. Candidates may file online or on paper. Forms and instructions with deadline dates are available in the University College office. Students are responsible for meeting the deadline for filing the Intent to Graduate. All graduates are invited to Commencement and recognition ceremonies in May when degrees are conferred and certificates presented. Independent Study, Directed Research, and Internships Through independent study or directed research, students may pursue topics of special interest under the supervision of a member of the faculty. Internships offer opportunities to apply classroom theory and concepts to practical work situations and to explore possible career directions. Students must submit a completed Independent Study form or Internship Learning Agreement to the University College office before registering. A maximum of 6 units of credit in independent work, including internships and study abroad, may count toward the Associate in Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees for students who complete 60 units or less at Washington University; students who earn more than 60 units at Washington University may do up to 9 units of independent work. No more than 6 units of independent study, including internships and study abroad, may be applied toward the major, and no more than 6 units of independent study may be attempted in a single semester. No more than 6 units of independent study may be applied toward a Master of Arts, Master of Science, or Doctor of Liberal Arts. No more than 6 credits of independent study may be applied toward a certificate program which requires 19 units of credit or more. No more than 3 credits of independent study may be applied toward a certificate program which requires 18 units of credit or less.Bulletin 2017-18 Academic Policies (06/27/17) 269ACTRAC Accelerated Option ACTRAC, the accelerated study option in University College, is available in most undergraduate majors and selected other courses for qualified students. Students choosing ACTRAC may receive one additional credit in a designated 300- or 400-level course by arranging with the instructor to do additional reading, research, and writing. ACTRAC requirements include admission to a University College undergraduate degree program, successful completion of at least 12 credits, 3.0 minimum grade point average, and University College verification and authorization. Students are charged tuition for 4 credits for an ACTRAC course. Minor A minor in University College consists of a minimum of 15 units of authorized course work in selected academic disciplines or interdisciplinary programs in University College. The course requirements for a minor are determined by each department or program. At least 9 units must be advanced course work (300- level or above), and at least 6 of the 9 units in advanced course work must be completed at University College. A maximum of 3 units of transfer credit may be applied to the minor. A minor is available only to students admitted to a University College Bachelor of Science degree program. Course work taken as part of the minor may fulfill distribution requirements, but the same course may not apply to both a major and a minor. Only courses receiving a grade of C- or higher will be applied to the minor. In order to be awarded the minor, students must earn a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 or higher in all courses taken toward the minor. Students may not pursue a minor in an area for which a certificate is offered in University College. To declare a minor, students must submit a completed \"Minor\" form to an academic adviser in University College before beginning the final semester. College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) University College will grant credit to students for successful completion of selected College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) tests. University College does not award academic credit for experiential learning or community and business activities other than through CLEP examinations. For more detailed information about eligibility, selected exams, exam administration, minimum scores, and all other CLEP matters, contact University College at 314-935-6700 or visit the University College website (http://ucollege.wustl.edu) . Advanced Placement Credit Students may receive a total of 15 units of advanced placement credit from standardized placement tests that were completed prior to being admitted to a University College undergraduate degree program. Units earned through advanced placement may apply toward University College distribution requirements. Inorder to receive advanced placement credit, submit official score reports from Advanced Placement Examinations, College Board Achievement and Aptitude Tests, the International Baccalaureate (higher levels), and British A-level examinations. The combined total number of units accepted in transfer credit for online courses, College-Level Examination Program, Advanced Placement, and International Baccalaureate may not exceed 30. Student Academic Records A permanent record of courses, grades, and credit for each student is maintained in the Office of Student Records, which will issue official transcripts upon written authorization by the student. Transcript requests must include student's name, student number, date of birth, and approximate dates of attendance. Student records may be reviewed online on WebSTAC (https://acadinfo.wustl.edu) . The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) provides current and former students of the university with specific rights of access to and control over their student record information. A copy of the university policies and procedures regarding educational records and the release of student record information may be obtained from the Office of Student Records. Academic Integrity All University College students are governed by the University Student Judicial Code to ensure \"the protection of the campus community and the maintenance of an environment conducive to learning and inquiry.\" Among the forms of misconduct covered in the University Student Judicial Code is academic misconduct, \"including, but not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, fabrication of data or records, unpermitted collaboration on assignments, misrepresentation of student status, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 falsification, or otherwise violating the Academic Integrity Policy. Knowingly making false allegations of academic misconduct against any student will itself be considered a form of academic misconduct.\" All University College undergraduate students \u2014 part-time, full-time, degree-seeking, and non-degree \u2014 are governed by the Undergraduate Student Academic Integrity Policy and the University College Undergraduate Student Academic Integrity Policy. If a student subject to the Washington University Undergraduate Student Academic Integrity Policy is alleged to have committed a violation of academic integrity, the case will generally be reviewed by the school or college in which the class is listed and taught, not the school in which the student is enrolled, though all violations and sanctions will also be reported to the student's college of enrollment. All allegations of violations of academic integrity concerning visiting students in University College, whether during the summer or academic year, should be referred to the Academic Integrity Officer in University College and are exceptions to the above rule. Violations of the Undergraduate Student Academic Integrity Policy include plagiarism, cheating on an examination, copying or collaborating on assignments without permission, fabricationBulletin 2017-18 Academic Policies (06/27/17) 270or falsification of data or records, and other forms of deceit, dishonesty, or inappropriate conduct. Please refer to the detailed Undergraduate Student Academic Integrity Policy at Washington University for definitions and examples of each of these categories. All University College graduate students are subject to the Graduate School Academic and Professional Integrity Policy for Graduate Students and the University College Graduate Student Academic and Professional Integrity Policy. If a student enrolled in a graduate program administered through University College takes a course through University College and is accused of an academic integrity violation in that course, the student will be subject to the University College Graduate Student Academic and Professional Integrity Policy. Note that those students enrolled in another graduate or professional school at Washington University will be subject to the academic and professional integrity policies and procedures applicable to their respective school. For example, if a student enrolled in the Graduate School also takes a course through University College and is accused of an academic integrity violation in that course, the student will be subject to the Graduate School Academic and Professional Integrity Policy for Graduate Students. Violations of the Graduate Student Academic and Professional Integrity Policy include plagiarism and other misappropriation of the work of another, cheating, copying or collaborating on assignments without permission, fabrication or falsification of data or records, research misconduct, obstruction of the academic activities of another, abuse of confidentiality, and other forms of deceit, dishonesty, or inappropriate conduct. Professional integrity violations consist of behavior that is inconsistent with ethical standards in the professional roles for which the student is being trained that are not covered by policies governing academic integrity. Please refer to the detailed Graduate School Academic and Professional Integrity Policy for Graduate Students for definitions and examples of each of these categories. All violations of academic integrity will be reported to and investigated by the academic integrity officer in University College. If it is determined that a student has acted dishonestly, or even if a student has admitted the charges prior to a formal investigation or hearing, an appropriate sanction will be imposed, including, but not limited to, automatic failure of the assignment or course, or, in the case of serious or repeat violations, suspension or expulsion from the university. Withdrawing from a course will not prevent the dean from imposing or recommending sanctions. Academic Advising and Academic Support Services University College recognizes the rich array of backgrounds and experiences adult learners bring to the classroom and is aware that adults entering or returning to higher education may need academic counseling, guidance, and special services. Information on University College degree and certificateprograms and courses is available on our website (http:// ucollege.wustl.edu) . Students are encouraged to meet with an academic adviser to discuss academic goals and interests prior to submitting an application for admission. Advisers are available to provide guidance and information about admissions, transfer and registration procedures, academic and degree requirements, course selection, special programs, student services, and other facets of Washington University. After being admitted to a degree or certificate program, students should consult with the adviser on a regular basis to discuss course sequences, degree requirements, policies, and other important information related to the particular program of study. It is the responsibility of the student to arrange for these periodic conferences. For information about advising and all student services, call the University College Office of Admissions and Student Services, 314-935-6777, or visit our website (http://ucollege.wustl.edu). Honors & Awards Undergraduate Honors Program The University College Honors program provides students with multiple opportunities to deepen and extend their knowledge, earn scholarships and academic awards, and join a community of intellectually and socially engaged adults.
