Their diverse projects\u2014on subjects ranging from cancer to the role of calligraphy in 19th-century chinese political lif e, epilepsy to the evolution of the Milky wa y\u2014offer a glimpse into the vibrant scientific, scholarly, and creative endeavors now engaging our students at the undergraduate and graduate levels, as well as our faculty and research staff across bu 's 17 schools and colleges on two campuses. The stories in this magazine highlight b oston u niversity's commitment to supporting scholarly activities and research in all their varied forms, including both individual efforts in particular departments and collaborative projects that stretch across two or more academic disciplines, or even across institutional, national, and international boundaries. Moreover, these efforts cover a broad range of topics in basic and applied sciences, sT e M fields, arts, humanities, and social sciences. w hat is more difficult to capture within the magazine-story-format is the intrinsically dynamic and unpredictable nature of the research process\u2014from the initial idea to the \"eureka\" moment of discovery to the published results. It is the roller coaster of fits and starts, together with the excitement of uncovering new truths while venturing into uncharted territories, that gives the research process its indescribable sense of exhilaration. This unpredictable process of discovery can be as informative as the final destination, and can often lead researchers in an entirely new and promising direction of inquiry. at bu we aspire to go beyond providing support for and facilitating the end point of research: our goal is to empower our faculty, research staff, and students to dream and take risks at every point of the research process defining the path to discovery, a goal symbolized by the \"what if\" theme of this year's Research cover. a ll aspects featured in this year's magazine\u2014the focus on integrating scholarly activities and research with our educational mission; the entrepreneurial, collaborative spirit of our faculty, staff, and students in developing programs within the u niversity and in building partnerships outside of the institution; and a global engagement with industry, government, and academia focused on translating basic ideas into applications for societal good\u2014are a reflection of b oston u niversity's vitality and its ascending trajectory into the top tier of major research universities.

The disease kills more than half a million Americans every year, and within two decades it will surpass heart disease as the nation's leading cause of death, according to the American Cancer Society. Boston University researchers are attacking this disease on many fronts\u2014spreading the word on risk and prevention, finding innovative ways to increase the effectiveness of established therapies, training the next genera-tion of cancer fighters, uncovering new drug targets, and enlisting the body's immune system as an anti-cancer warrior. Confronting Cancer6 RESEARCh AT BoSToN UNIvERSITy 2010 7 www.BU.EDU /RESEARCh Research cancer What is needed now, says Wang, is an understanding of what genetic risk information will motivate people to choose healthy behaviors and what risk information, if any, might actually impede these healthier lifestyle choices. For example, a \"high\" genetic risk could scare some people into fatalism, while a \"low\" genetic risk might give others a false sense of security. She says that the \"rush to market\" of direct-to-consumer genetic tests ignores these basic ques- tions about genetic risk interpretation and behavior that public health researchers are only starting to answer. \"There are a lot of people saying, 'I'm smart enough to make decisions; give me the information and get the doc-tors out of the way,'\" says Wang. \"But they're making some serious decisions about their health after seeing only part of the picture.\" T racking a Killer Muhammad Zaman's fight against brain cancer in kids began with a wrong turn. A few years ago, while searching for a colleague's lab in the University of T exas's M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, he got lost and ended up in the pediatric ward. \"My daughter had recently been born, and it pained me to see how many of these kids were probably not going to make it,\" says Zaman, an assistant professor of biomedical engineering. Zaman had been seeking a clinical application for his research into the physical, chemical, and biological details of cancer cell migration in the body, what's known as metastasis. Partnering with researchers at the Mas- sachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Manchester (UK), he decided to focus on pediatric brain cancer, which gets much less research attention than the most common childhood cancer, leukemia. Zaman's goal is to use his intricate computational and experimental mod-els of pediatric brain cancer cell migration to pinpoint the key biochemical mechanisms that support metastasis. Traditionally, he says, clinicians followed a \"Mini-Me strategy\" when it came to treating cancer in kids, simply cutting the dose of the same chemotherapy drugs used for adults. But children's rapid development means that the environment in which cancer grows and migrates in their bodies is far different than it is in adults. In addition, one of the major reasons why so many chemotherapy drugs fail when transitioning from the lab to the clinic, Zaman says, is that they are developed by watch- ing cancer cells move on two-dimensional plastic surfaces. The key for more successful drug development, therefore, is to study cancer cell migration and test therapeutics using a more lifelike model of a biological system. Supported by nearly $2 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health, Zaman and his research partners use a laser-scanning microscope to track cultured cancer cells moving through three-dimensional \"matrices\" of a common protein such as collagen, or a synthetic soft- tissue. They then assemble the time-lapse microscopic images into detailed computer simulations of real-time cell movement. \"This is what the cells see as they travel through the matrix,\" says Zaman, as he plays one such video on his com-puter; it shows a tunneling journey through the amorphous network of a porous protein structure. The experiments are used in combination with computational models Zaman has built from what is already known about cell signal- ing and cell binding, and about the stresses and the forces operating within the matrix. He periodically refines and improves the models based on experimental data. \"We're trying to find out what enables or hinders cancer cell migration and invasion, so that people will be able to develop therapeutics that specifically target those mechanisms,\" says Dewi Harjanto, a biomedical engineer- ing doctoral student who works with Zaman. \" There are a lot of people saying, 'I'm smart enough to make decisions; give me the informa- tion and get the doctors out of the way.' But they're making some serious decisions about their health after seeing only part of the picture.\" Quantitative visualiza- tions like this model of a tumor's extracellular matrix offer a better understanding of how tumor metastasis functions in children and adults. Cracking the Cancer Code Is some disease risk riskier than the rest? Last May, under pressure from the Food and Drug Administration, Walgreens postponed its plans to sell a test that claimed to show genetic risk for cancer and other diseases. These types of direct-to-consumer genetic tests worry many public health experts, includ- ing Catharine Wang, an assistant professor of community health sciences in the School of Public Health. Wang studies how the public interprets and acts on disease risk\u2014 or doesn't. Much of her recent work has focused on how people understand genetic cancer risk. Wang believes that direct-to-consumer tests give people an incomplete sense of their cancer risk, which may cloud public health messages about health behaviors\u2014such as eating right, exercise, and routine physicals and screen- ings\u2014that are known to reduce the onset and lethality of the disease. She notes that an individual's chance of contracting any disease typically involves a complicated interplay of genetics and lifestyle choices, with a lot of unknowns. \"Every day, there are more findings of genetic asso- ciations from minor DNA variants, and industry jumps on those discoveries,\" she says. \"But the public health community is saying, we're not ready.\" Some of the open questions include whether people will overestimate risk when it stems from their genes and whether knowing something about their genetic predis- positions will make them more or less likely to make the health behavior choices that reduce disease risk. In a study published last year in the journal Cancer Causes and Control, Wang found that the vast majority of more than 400 healthy women who were surveyed ranked heredity as the most important causal factor for both breast and colon cancer\u201484 and 78 percent respectively, despite the fact that prior studies have estimated that 38 percent of breast cancers and 45 percent of colon cancers are preventable through a combination of healthy eating, exercise, and weight management. Suzanne Miller, director of the psychosocial and behavioral medicine program at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia and one of Wang's research col-laborators, says, \"As we learn more and more about cancer and its treatment at the genetic level, Catharine's work shows us that we need to intervene at the level of the whole person, not just at the level of their molecular genetics.\" Muhammad Zaman (continued on next page) New direct-to-consumer genetic risk tests could be a help or a hindrance, says public health expert Catharine w ang, depending on the way genetic risk information motivates behavior. By ChRIS BERDIk 8 RESEARCh AT BoSToN UNIvERSITy 2010 9 www.BU.EDU /RESEARCh Research cancer While most studies look at individual cancer cell migration, Harjanto is investigating how clusters of cancer cells, mini-tumors, sometimes migrate away from the main tumor. She is focusing on how the density of the collagen matrix affects this movement. Another collaborator, Roger Kamm, an MIT professor of mechanical and biological engineering, is using microflu-idic systems to see how cancer cell movement is affected by varying the fluid flow through the matrix. Other experiments alter the pH of the matrix or the DNA of the cancer cell. Eventually, says Zaman, they will introduce different drugs to these systems, \"to see what happens to those cells and their ability to move, divide, and form tumors.\" No matter what variable is being altered, \"this is a sys- tems question,\" Zaman stresses. \"It is not about looking at a single gene in isolation,\" he says. \"Instead, it's about how multiple proteins inside the cell interact with the environ- ment of the tumor, how one protein influences another, and how those interact with the cellular systems and with the structures inside the body.\" Engineering a New Line of Defense Part of what makes cancer so deadly is subterfuge\u2014 even while it invades and destroys the body's organs, most cancers appear \"normal\" to our immune system's T-cells, a type of white blood cell and the core of our defense against disease. But the jig may soon be up for some cancers, thanks to Richard Junghans, an associate professor of surgery and an oncologist and hematologist at the BU-affiliated Roger Williams Medical Center in Providence, Rhode Island. Funded by a 2009 $5.9 million Impact Award from the Department of Defense's Breast Cancer Research Program, Junghans is genetically modifying T-cells to recognize cancer cells and kill them. \"These are living drugs, made from the patient's own cells,\" says Junghans, who is currently overseeing Phase I clinical trials of the designer T-cells\u2014which he affection- ately calls \"nano-bio-bots\"\u2014to fight metastatic breast can-cer. \"Using the immune system is the fourth arm of cancer therapy with the hope of succeeding even when we have a patient whose cancer is growing despite chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery,\" he says. Cancer patients travel to Roger Williams from around the country to receive treatment in the clinical trials. At the Roger Williams Cancer Center, in a building adjacent to Junghans's office, T-cells are harvested from the patients' blood. Downstairs, in a cleanroom, researchers use a genet-ically engineered virus that cannot reproduce to carry a bit of new genetic code into the T-cell chromosomes, program- ming a new receptor to recognize a signature molecule, known as carcinoembryonic antigen, or CEA for short, that is present in half of all breast cancers. These genetically modified T-cells are cultured until about 400 billion are grown per patient. Then, they're infused through an IV back into the patients in varying amounts, after which patients are observed over several weeks as outpatients. The current trials are using a \"second generation\" of designer T-cells. The first generation was tested about a decade ago. They were effective in kill-ing cancer cells, but didn't keep at it for long, because not only do T-cells need to be educated about what to attack, they also need to be activated by signals from other cells in the immune system, called dendritic cells. Junghans's second-generation T-cells have a special signaling chain\u2014engineered to activate when the T-cells encounter a tumor\u2014built in along with the CEA receptor. This signaling chain should allow the T-cells \"to pro liferate, and survive, and maintain their active status,\" he explains. Because CEA is also expressed by some healthy tis- sues, the Phase I trials are using \"escalating exposures\" to the new T-cells in order to identify what Junghans calls \"a window of therapeutic opportunity between anti-tumor effectiveness and patient toxicity.\" The Phase I trials will continue for another year, and Junghans's research team is continuing to make small modi-fications to the designer T-cells. Phase II and III clinical tri- als will follow, with the goal, Junghans says, of curing breast cancer that expresses CEA within the next five years. Enhanced Chemotherapy when it comes to killing cancer, sometimes timing is everything. In studies backed by the National Insti-tutes of health, David w axman\u2014who is a professor of biology and a professor of medicine, as well as associate director for basic research at the BU Cancer Center\u2014has found that simply altering the schedul-ing of chemotherapy may enlist the body's immune system as an additional cancer fighter. Waxman's research builds on the idea of \"metronomic chemotherapy,\" conceived about a decade ago by the late Judah Folkman, the famous cancer researcher of Chil- dren's Hospital Boston. Instead of giving patients several, widely spaced rounds of a \"maximum tolerated dose\" of chemotherapy, which poisons both cancerous and healthy tissue, Folkman proposed using lower chemotherapy doses more frequently. In his studies, metronomic chemotherapy not only killed cancer directly through toxicity, it also shrank tumors. The theory on the latter effect was that more frequent drug doses did sustained damage to the blood vessels that supply tumors with oxygen and nutri-ents, a process known as \"anti-angiogenesis.\" In Waxman's own metronomic chemotherapy studies, which involved administering an older drug called cyclo-phosphamide every six days to mice with induced tumors, he observed tumor regression to an extent \"that we had never seen using maximum tolerated dose.\" Some tumors even disappeared completely. But, says Waxman, \"we reasoned that there had to be another mechanism,\" beyond destroying blood vessels. They based this suspicion partly on the relatively weak tumor-shrinking performance of a new class of anti-cancer drugs that specifically work as anti-angiogenesis therapies, targeting the tumor-feeding blood vessels. And they were right. When Waxman and his team compared some of the new, anti-angiogenesis drugs directly with metronomic chemotherapy, the anti-angio-genesis drugs were better at knocking out blood vessels, but not nearly as effective in actually shrinking the tumors. In addition, says Waxman, studies carried out by Joshua Doloff, a doctoral student in Waxman's lab who graduated this May, revealed \"lots of immune cells populating the tumors\" of the mice receiving metronomic chemotherapy. That raised the astounding possibility that an older chemotherapy drug not only out-performs a new drug specifically designed to starve tumors of their blood supply, but that this older drug was recruiting a cancer fighter that researchers have been trying to harness for years\u2014 the body's innate immune system. Unlike the adaptive immune system, which attacks only specific pathogens it identifies as foreign, the innate immune system is a more general defense against infec-tion. Waxman and his collaborators are now trying to determine why metronomic chemotherapy might trigger this response. One hypothesis favored by Doloff is that the repeated damage to cells by metronomic chemotherapy triggers a sustained inflammation response. \"In that case,\" says Doloff, \"the immune system is going in basically to clean up the mess.\" The mystery is complicated by the fact that the treat- ments are remarkably effective against some tumor types but relatively ineffective in shrinking others, including some types of colon, lung, and prostate tumors. \"We need to under- stand more about the mechanism to know whether there's a way to stimulate this process in humans,\" says Waxman. Richard Junghans David Waxman\" It's not about looking at a single gene in isolation. It's about how genes and the environment interact, how one protein influences another, and how those interact with the cellular systems and with the structures inside the body.\" Altering a patient's treatment schedule to maximize his or her immune response\u2014 by giving lower doses more frequently, and by utilizing an older chemotherapy drug\u2014 can shrink tumors more efficiently. well-known for their role in fighting infection, T-cells may be programmable to recognize and attack cancer cells as well.11 www.BU.EDU /RESEARCh 10 RESEARCh AT BoSToN UNIvERSITy 2010Research Snapshot Research cancer Knowing the Enemy Behind the 1.4 million new cancer cases in America every year are even more stories\u2014about lives before and after the diagnosis and about the ups and downs of treatment. Last April, second-year Boston Univer - sity School of Medicine students heard one of these stories from a 67-year-old woman who recently completed surgery and radiation for breast cancer. The students listened, and then they asked questions ranging from, \"How did you first react to the diagnosis?\" to \"Is it okay for oncologists to hug their patients?\" The class is part of the Oncology Education Initiative, spearheaded by Ariel Hirsch, an assistant professor of radi-ology, and Karen Antman, dean of the School of Medicine. \"No matter what field they choose, every medical student is going to encounter cancer at some point in their career,\" says Hirsch, whose education initiative began in 2007 when she arranged to give a single lecture on radia-tion oncology to all fourth-year medical students during the core radiology rotation. In 2009, her efforts were helped by an education grant from the Radiological Society of North America, and she became the leader of a new two-week oncology block in the medical school's second-year curriculum. Previously, BU medical students learned about cancer in a piecemeal fashion\u2014covering lung cancer in the pulmonary block and colon cancer when learning about the gastrointestinal system, for instance. In addition, the fourth-year rotation in radiology was expanded to third-year students, giving more students the chance to shadow Hirsch as she treats patients and to collaborate in her research. Such comprehensive cancer education, particu-larly the instruction in radiation oncology, is rare in medical schools, says Hirsch. In fact, a 2009 literature review found only seven journal articles in ten years that men- tioned teaching radia- tion oncology to medical students, and two of them were about the efforts at Boston University. \"Cancer is the second leading cause of death in this country, and rising. And about 60 percent of cancer patients will be treated with radiation,\" says Hirsch. \"We need to make sure we're as prepared as we can be for that.\" Being prepared includes understanding the emotional side of patient care, says Hirsch, whose office is decorated with gifts from former patients\u2014a doll from Trinidad, a decorative plate adorned with a Jamaican flag, a wood figurine carved by a Haitian patient. It also means learning about the cutting-edge radia- tion equipment that sits behind thick, shielded doors down the hallway from Hirsch's office, such as the \"CyberKnife,\" installed in 2008, which uses a large, robotic arm to deliver a high dose of radiation from multiple angles, and has image-guided tracking software and a camera that syncs the radiation beam to a patient's breathing cycle for increased accuracy. Finally, it means exposure to research. Hirsch invites students to collaborate with her in ongoing studies, on topics such as radiation therapy after robot-assisted prostate cancer surgery, and the effects of embedding radiation-emitting radioisotopes in the cement used to reinforce vertebrae and alleviate the pain of malignant compression fractures that result from cancer spreading to the spinal column. Hirsch also involves students in measuring the effec- tiveness of the oncology education initiative and in finding ways to improve and expand it, with the ultimate aim, she says, of creating a model for oncology education at other medical schools. One of Hirsch's advisees, Nick DeNunzio, who is pursuing a joint MD/PhD in physiology and bio- physics, is the lead author on a paper recently accepted by the Journal of the American College of Radiology. It recom-mends that medical schools reinforce oncology education with extracurricular initiatives such as lunch-time faculty seminars, student interest group advising, mentoring pro-grams, and summer research internships. \"It's these auxiliary pieces of education, not necessar- ily in the classroom, that can supplement and strengthen an understanding of the field,\" says DeNunzio. After all, he says, \"you only have so many hours in a day, and you have all of medicine to cover during those four years.\" REver since Massachusetts became the first state to mandate health insurance in 2006, the nation has been watching to see how the reforms would impact patients and hospitals. A recent study conducted by School of Medicine faculty members Amresh hanchate and Nancy kressin may offer some clues. The study has caught the attention of policymakers, researchers, and others across the country who are interested in how previously uninsured and underinsured individuals may be benefiting from health care legislation. In particular, hanchate and kressin are investigating whether minor - ity populations that did not have access to affordable health insurance before 2006 have started to seek medical attention for referral-sensitive procedures. han- chate defines these as \"inpatient surgical procedures for which most admissions are scheduled by physician referral and not via the Emergency Department or transferred from other inpatient facilities,\" and which are therefore likely to be sensitive to insur - ance status. Such procedures are tradition-ally underutilized by minorities. For their study, hanchate and kressin focused on a range of cardiovascular, cancer, and musculoskeletal procedures. They began, says kressin, with a fundamental question: \"If somebody now has an insur -ance card that they could take to a primary care provider, would they be more likely to get care (e.g., a procedure) that requires the provider's referral?\" T o ascertain whether access to health insurance had made an impact, hanchate and kressin analyzed data collected from Massachusetts hospitals on referral-sensi-tive procedures performed between 2004 and 2008\u2014two years before and two years after the health care legislation passed. They used inpatient discharge data on 2,656,554 white patients, 195,481 African American patients, and 172,852 hispanic patients. The results were staggering. The data showed a marked increase in the use of these procedures across the board, but especially among the minority groups. African American patients, for instance, had a 25 percent increase in heart surgeries after the passage of health care reform. For knee replacement surgeries, there was a 17 percent increase among African Americans, and a 9 percent increase among hispanics. \"we have shown that health care reform has positively impacted minority patients in Massachusetts,\" says hanchate. In addition to referral-sensitive procedures, hanchate and kressin are also interested in examining the impact of health reform on the use of emergency admis-sions. w ithout insurance, patients with nonemergency conditions tend to wait until their health deteriorates to the point where they cannot continue without medical care. Then they go to the emergency room. As a result, says hanchate, \"Any time a patient comes into the ER because of complications of asthma or diabetes, we say it's in some sense a failure of proper care.\" There are several problems with this strategy. Emergency room visits are expen-sive, for one thing, and patients who cannot afford health insurance can rarely afford to pay thousands of dollars for emergency care. There is a human cost, too, for the lack of health insurance that goes far beyond the price of a trip to the ER. \"one response from the patient would be just to delay, and people can delay to some extent things like knee replacements,\" says hanchate. \"The way some people cope is just by cutting down on their activity level and postponing.\" In many cases, the decision to postpone can be life-threatening. yet another step in their research will involve taking a closer look at what hospitals are doing to reduce the rate of readmission. \"If people have better access to outpatient care when they come home from the hos- pital,\" says kressin, \"that may prevent them from needing to be quickly readmitted for something that didn't get resolved once they were discharged from the hospital.\" Currently, 20 percent of people who are hospitalized return to a hospital within a month, which could mean that hospitals need to do a better job of explaining to patients when and how they need to follow up with their primary care physician for treatment and medication. Last year hanchate and kressin were selected to share their early findings in a ple- nary talk at the Society of General Internal Medicine's annual meeting, reflecting the wide appeal and interest of their work. \"The national health reform law that passed earlier in the year is very similar, in many respects, to the Massachusetts reform law,\" says hanchate. \"The entire nation is going to be watching how Massachusetts turns out, and any effects that we see here are going to directly get the attention in washington, DC.\" RBy KatheRine CalveR hawKins \"we have shown that health care reform has positively impacted minority patients in Massachusetts.\" Web extra See more at www.bu.edu/research/ magazine\u00e7 \" Cancer is the second leading cause of death in this country, and rising.

And yet the role of women in global society continues to change and to be contested. women's own perceptions of their status\u2014and consequently, their advocacy for their own needs and the needs of their families\u2014ripple out to affect the health and well-being of entire communities. New research from across BU's two campuses is shedding light on the evolving roles, rights, and responsibilities of women historically and in the present day. 14 RESEARCh AT BoSToN UNIvERSITy 2010 15 www.BU.EDU /RESEARCh Research Women & Family New Hope for Newborns Clean, dry blankets. Antibiotics. Immediate, exclusive breastfeeding. A sterile blade for cutting umbilical cords. The tools for ensuring the health and safety of newborn babies are humble\u2014and frustratingly elusive in many parts of the world. Even as overall childhood mortality has declined, nearly four million babies die each year within their first month, the majority from entirely preventable disorders. How to bridge the distance between what we know will save newborns' lives and the stubbornly high neonatal mortality rate in places like Africa and South Asia? One way is to attack the problem on the ground\u2014to go into poor, rural communities, look at exactly what happens and who sur- rounds a woman as she delivers her baby, and find practical, easily implementable methods of influencing those events. That's what Davidson Hamer has done for the past 15 years, and that's what the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is doing by funding his latest project, one that looks at the effects on infant survival of a beautifully simple postnatal intervention to improve umbilical cord care in Zambia's Southern Province. Hamer, a professor of international health and medi- cine, has a five-year, $8.4 million grant to study the effec-tiveness of getting mothers to apply a 4 percent solution of chlorhexidine, a topical disinfectant, to umbilical cords in the days immediately following birth. Chlorhexidine helps to prevent sepsis, \"a severe bacterial infection that prob- ably accounts for between 20 and 40 percent of neonatal deaths, depending on the region,\" Hamer says. Sepsis can arise when bacteria get into the bloodstream, either through infection of the umbilical cord stump, treatment of the cord with contaminated substances, or by cutting the cord with an unsterile knife. \"The newborn's immune system has not fully developed,\" Hamer says, \"and the bacteria can cause it to become very sick, very quickly.\" Hamer will be assisted by Katherine Semrau, an assistant professor of international health and epidemiologist who has extensive experience liv - ing and conducting research in Zambia. Very few large-scale neonatal survival interventions have been tried in Africa, due in part to the lack of popula-tion density in many regions. Hamer has worked in Zambia before, so navigating through the country's topographical challenges and complex system of health ministry officials, local chieftains, community health workers, and traditional birth attendants (TBAs)\u2014all of whom he needs to involve and engage\u2014is familiar. Hamer and colleagues at the Center for Global Health & Development conducted a study in the north-central 1 23 4 Lufwanyama District. Hamer's project trained TBAs\u2014mini-mally educated women who act as midwives\u2014to treat the most preventable causes of newborn death: sepsis, neonatal asphyxia (respiratory failure), and postpartum hypothermia. The results were so encouraging\u2014with approximately 40 percent fewer neonatal deaths in newborns tended by the trained TBAs\u2014that Save the Children has helped convert the study site into a five-year, community-based program to improve maternal, neonatal, and child health and to serve as a model training center for other organizations interested in carrying out similar work in poor rural populations in Africa. His current project, Hamer hopes, will have similar long-range impact, especially when assessed alongside another Gates-funded study, also looking at chlorhexidine and umbilical cord care, in Tanzania. \"If these two large, well-designed studies show similar impact\u2014a 10, 20, 30 percent reduction in mortality\u2014that, along with recent find- ings from South Asia, will be enough evidence for the World Health Organization to change global policy,\" he says. Safety in Numbers when the thalidomide tragedy of the 1960s revolutionized the drug regulatory system in the United States and elsewhere, the only group that did not benefit from the new safety net was the same group devastated by thalidomide's destructive effects: pregnant women and their babies. The drug, touted as safe and effective, was given to treat morning sickness in pregnancy; after its dire conse- quences became apparent, in children born with shortened limbs and other malformations, thalidomide was quickly banned, and stricter testing protocols for medications and pesticides were later mandated. \"But when a drug comes onto the market today, it has almost never been tested in pregnant women,\" says Allen Mitchell, professor of epidemiology and pediatrics and director of the Slone Epidemiology Center. There are good reasons for that, he says\u2014ethical clinical trials would be impossible to construct\u2014\"but it means that the only time you can study the safety and risks of a drug in pregnancy is when it's in the marketplace.\" Since 1976, Mitchell and his colleagues at Slone have done precisely that, collecting data on prenatal drug exposures in more than 40,000 women through Mitchell's pioneering Birth Defects Study (BDS). Now the study is being expanded with a significant federal investment and an infrastructure that promises an unprecedentedly com- prehensive view of risk and safety. The goal is to provide critical risk and safety data for women and their doctors, with the initial focus on seasonal flu vaccine, antiviral medicines used to prevent or treat flu, and commonly prescribed asthma medications. As the study expands, it will also gather data on the wide range of medications used by pregnant women, including over-the-counter headache cures and herbal remedies. Thus, the study will identify as early as possible which medications are relatively safe and which might pose a risk to the fetus. BDS is one of two data collection components collabo- rating with the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology on what is being called the first broad-based, systematic study of the risks of vaccines and medicines in pregnancy. The new study\u2014Vaccines and Medication in Poverty, poor infrastructure, and a lack of education have conspired to produce high infant and maternal mortality rates in Zambia's Lufwan- yama District (1, 2). But early results of a study by Davidson hamer suggest that by training traditional birth attendants (4) to avoid the three most common causes of neonatal death\u2014sepsis, asphyxia, and hypothermia\u2014infant mortality can be reduced by 40 percent, leading to healthier and happier mothers and babies (3).

It will combine the strengths of complementary\u2014but separately implemented\u2014epide-miological techniques, a case-control surveillance method developed by the Slone Center, and pregnancy registries (cohort studies) conducted by a network of specialists who collaborate through the Organization of Teratology Infor-mation Specialists. Mitchell's group identifies women in four regions of the country who have given birth to children with defects, and a smaller group of women with normal outcomes, and then conducts carefully constructed interviews designed to identify every drug or herbal remedy they took during pregnancy. Among its many findings, the Birth Defects Study has shown that antidepressant use in pregnancy is generally safe, but that among a popular group of antide- pressants, SSRIs, Prozac carries the lowest risk of birth defects and Paxil the highest. That finding wound up on the medication label, and Paxil use in pregnancy has since dropped, Mitchell says. \"The Food and Drug Administration has not only the legal authority but a legal mandate to demand post-marketing safety studies for drugs that were not adequately studied in pregnancy prior to marketing\u2014which means just about everything,\" Mitchell says. The agency has been slow to flex that authority, he adds, but that may be chang- ing. \"There is considerable excitement at the FDA, and also at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and in practitioner groups, about what our study will yield.\" Sex and Sensibility In the history of feminism and the women's rights movement, one group of key actors in late-18th- century Britain has been long overlooked. Swept forward by the revolutionary currents then swirling, they socialized and debated in mixed-gender clubs, or pushed for broader educational opportunities, or courageously withstood public censure to call for full political participation for women. Who were these bold thinkers? In a word, men\u2014 men who, for a variety of moral, philosophical, and even self-serving reasons, felt strongly that women's rights were not just a women's issue, but a matter of concern to society at large. In an act of historical recovery, Arianne Chernock has brought this loosely connected group of several dozen dissenters and reformers to the fore in Men and the Making of Modern British Feminism (Stanford University Press, 2010). As she shows, these progressive educators, theolo- gians, historians, essayists, and physicians were living in a time when the subject of individual rights\u2014who had them and how they were conferred\u2014was central to the intellec- tual and political discourse. These reformers were unconventional, nonconform- ist, and mostly fringe characters, with the exception of Jeremy Bentham, a radical jurist and philosopher best remembered as the founder of utilitarianism. \"I don't claim that they were emblematic of the broader society,\" says Chernock, an assistant professor of history. \"But these were men who really saw women's rights as a social con-cern that had a lot to say about the health of their own state. They were broadly interested in what it would mean to live in what they called a 'perfect state.' This was a moment of revolution, and so we see a lot of utopian ideas circulating.\" Those ideas, and the passions they engendered, were eclectic. Most of the men shared an opposi- tion to slavery and to the so-called Test and Corporation Acts, which penalized religious dissenters. Many were also \"campaigning for their own political representation,\" says Chernock, since less than one-fifth of men in Britain could vote at the time. Others championed things like vegetarianism and penal reform, or even argued \"that the alphabet should be made more democratic by introducing phonetic spelling. There is a real range of figures there,\" Chernock says. Their motivations differed widely, too. Some were clearly driven by personal histories, and by a sense of their own status as second-class citizens. Others \"embraced women's rights primarily to be consistent and to avoid hypocrisy,\" Chernock says, \"especially those who sub- scribed to the theory of natural rights.\"Research Snapshot Research Women & Family Streptococcus pneumoniae\u2014a bacterium that can cause pneumonia, meningitis, and a host of other invasive infections, result - ing in the deaths of between two and three million children each year\u2014is a master of disguise. Its outermost surface is covered by a capsule made up of sugars, and can come in any of 91 different capsular variants, or serotypes, depending on the composition of the sugars. The large number of serotypes\u2014each with a different antigen that must be recognized by the body's immune system in order for the bacteria to be destroyed\u2014has so far thwarted efforts to develop a vaccine effective against all capsular variants of S. pneumoniae, also called pneumococcus. Professor of Pediatrics Richard Goldstein hopes to change that, soon. A molecular geneticist by training, he is bring- ing a thorough knowledge of evolutionary mechanisms to bear on the search for a novel pneumococcal vaccine target, with support from the hartwell Foundation and the National Institutes of health. The existing vaccine, Prevnar-13, offers protection against 13 of the most common and virulent S. pneumoniae serotypes. It is an extraordinary accomplish-ment, says Goldstein, who cites Prevnar co-inventor Porter Anderson as one of his heroes, but unfortunately it may not offer a permanent solution. \"Prevnar-13 responds to the most prevalent serotypes responsible for invasive pneumonia in North America,\" Goldstein explains. \"But the dark cloud is, subtract 13 from 91 and what do you get? The others are still out there. The question then becomes, will those other serotypes step in to replace the 13 covered by Prevnar?\" The answer appears to be yes. Epi- demiological evidence suggests that the highly variable S. pneumoniae is capable of circumventing vaccines, through an increase in infections by non-vaccine serotypes. \"But a broadly efficacious 91-valent vaccine is quite unlikely,\" says Goldstein. \"It's too complicated to manu- facture, and too costly to attempt.\" Instead, Goldstein intends to identify and characterize a new cat - egory of vaccine target, called a \"common sur - face protein\"\u2014that is, an antigenically acces- sible protein universal to all of the otherwise variant capsular types of S. pneumoniae. T o do so, he is surveying pneumococ- cal DNA for genes that might code for such common proteins, then determining which of these genes are resistant to mutation, and thus \"conserved\" throughout the species. \"If it's not conserved across the species, it's not a good vaccine target,\" says Goldstein, because it leaves nature with a vacuum to fill. \"The goal of the common protein strat - egy is not to allow for that vacuum.\" Goldstein is currently examining what he calls \"chromosomal cold spots\"\u2014regions of pneumococcal chromosome where variation is tolerated. \"Mutations do occur,\" Goldstein says. \" however, those mutations are lethal. Any bacterium with that mutation is naturally purged from the population.\" The hope is that one or more of these \"cold spots\" will prove to encode a highly promis- ing vaccine target. T o test whether a particular cold spot is conserved across the species, Goldstein has amassed a unique collection of over 1,000 pneumococcal isolates from around the globe and organized them by genetic-relatedness into a vast phylogenic tree. The phylogenic tree serves as a template of S. pneumoniae species evolutionary diversity. The larger the tree, the more accurate a picture of species evolutionary diversity it provides. \"There's no one in the world who has the collection I have, and even so, it is not yet robust enough,\" says Goldstein, who recently received hundreds of additional isolates from Africa and South Asia, thanks to collaborators at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and in karachi, Pakistan. \"A phylogenetically organized col-lection, that's the key thing.\" The task before him amounts to a monumental and painstaking process of collation, but Goldstein is eager to take it on, driven by a strong desire to prevent and alleviate suffering caused by S. pneumoniae. \"More than two million children die a year of pneumococcal infections,\" he says, and those who survive can be left with serious, lasting health problems. \"of course children in poor, developing countries suffer the most. But this is a real problem in the United States too because of serotype replacement.\" Goldstein dreams of recreating Porter Anderson's remarkable success with another vaccine, for Haemophilus influenzae type b (hib), which has resisted serotype replace-ment for more than two decades and led to a 99 percent drop in deaths and serious complications from hib since the early 1980s. \"I always wanted to ask him, ' how does it feel to get up in the morning? T o know you've saved millions of children's lives?'\" If the common protein strategy proves successful, Goldstein just might find out.

A novelist named James Henry Lawrence, for instance, urged men to abandon patriarchy and relieve themselves of the constant burden of having to provide for their families. \"He was saying, if we give women these rights, men could become this amazing group of phi-losophers, politicians, poets, and everything else we want to be,\" Chernock explains. That ignoble rationale is one of the reasons why she frames the book as an argument not for male feminism but for the decoupling of sex and feminism. \"I'm not trying to undermine women's contributions and accomplishments,\" she says. \"But we have a much more solid foundation for thinking about women's rights when we realize the range of people who subscribed to them, and the range of reasons why they did.\" Working It Out want a long and happ y marriage? you ha ve to work for it. Literally. In an important series of studies that cast a critical eye on the nostalgically driven, politically loaded idea that working women are bad for marriage, two BU economists have found that dual-career marriages are actually more stable, and less likely to end in divorce, than marriages in which only one partner works. Looking at a cross section of U.S. states, Professor of Economics Andrew New-man and Associate Profes-sor of Economics Claudia Olivetti have found that in states where women have a very high rate of participa-tion in the labor force, such as Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Iowa, the divorce rate is lower than in states like Kentucky or Arizona, where the female labor force participation is low. Similarly, in states with a high percentage of two-earner households, divorce rates are much lower, even controlling for total household income. This most real-world of applied research projects started as a conversation between two theorists. New-man and his former BU colleague Zvika Neeman, now at Tel Aviv University, were observing that in bargaining theory, \"it made a difference whether the participants in the bargain were able to make what we economists call side payments to one another,\" Newman says. \"We said that one example of that would be a household consisting of two earners\u2014that they'd have many more allocation possibili-ties than a household with just one earner.\" Predicting fewer divorces in the two-earner house- holds, they approached Olivetti, who studies issues related to women's employment and wages. She confirmed an under-recognized fact: since the mid-1980s, as women have increased their participation in the labor force, divorce rates have actually fallen. Theories about working women causing divorce\u2014theories that held sway both in the popu-lar mind and in academia, Olivetti says\u2014\"fall to pieces\" when you look at the data. Newman and Olivetti subsequently found that \"for couples in which the wife can be considered a career woman, the probability of the marriage ending in divorce is 25 percent lower than for other couples,\" Olivetti says. And when they looked at couples in which the wife makes at least 50 percent of the household income, those equal-earning marriages are even less likely to end in divorce. What is driving the correlation? It's not about total income, Newman and Olivetti stress, since marriages with one high-earning partner were not protected. It's about the distribution of money\u2014and purchasing power\u2014within the household. The researchers speculate that something called flexible accommodation is at play\u2014which brings the conversation back to bargaining theory. \"The nice thing about money, as crass as it may seem to think that this is how we relate to each other, is that it enables you to purchase a full market basket of whatever goods you like,\" says Newman. \"And so when things get a little difficult in a marriage, accommodations can be made.\" You can hire a babysitter for a weekend away, or relieve your spouse or yourself of lawn-mowing or houseclean-ing duties. \"In a two-earner household, you're going to be able to accommodate more of the vicissitudes of married life,\" Newman says. Money still can't buy you love, in other words, but the equal distribution of it may buy a durable marriage. R Yuri Mazurkevich20 RESEARCh AT BoSToN UNIvERSITy 2010 21 www.BU.EDU /RESEARCh By o'RyA hyDE-kELLER Research Asia The world's largest and most populous continent, Asia may also be the most diverse, with subregions containing vastly different cultures, environments, historical ties, and government systems. For centuries it has captivated the imagination of visitors from around the world. T oday, it inspires the research of more than 50 faculty members affiliated with BU's Center for the Study of Asia. T ogether and independently, faculty at BU are exploring the history, economics, values, and art of Asia from a variety of perspectives. w ith projects focusing on leisure, coffee, and a little-known 19th-century civil servant, it seems that some- times you have to start small to tackle a subject as large as Asia. A History of Hobbies what do modern-day Japanese smokers, Qing imperial hunts, and the art of the Mughal Empire all have in common? That's what several faculty members in Asian Studies found themselves asking in 2008, shortly after the opening of the BU Center for the Study of Asia, led by w illiam Grimes, an associate professor of international relations and the center's director until last summer. In September, Joseph Fewsmith became the new director, and Grimes became chair of the Inter national Relations Department. With more than 50 BU faculty involved, the center's diversity\u2014in terms of geographic regions of interest and scholarly disciplines, with every - thing from Turkey to China and economics to art history represented\u2014was overwhelmingly full of possibilities. \"We wanted to know, what kinds of interests do we share? And how can we build on the synergy of all of us being in one place?\" says Robert Weller, professor and chair of the Department of Anthropology. \"We were looking for a topic that enough people worked on, and found inter- esting and fun, to pursue.\" The point of convergence turned out to be a surpris- ing one: leisure. The ways that people across Asia have spent their free time over the centuries was a topic that many Asian Studies faculty were already looking at\u2014some without even realizing it. \"At first you might think, I've got nothing to say about this topic,\" says Weller, who is cur-rently looking at the relations between religion and civil life among Chinese communities in Malaysia, China, and Taiwan. Key to facilitating collaboration across depart- ments, he says, was encouraging researchers to \"rethink what we even mean by leisure.\" \"For example, if long ago a member of the Chinese elite painted in the evening, that's not exactly leisure because we know he had to do it to maintain his political credibility,\" says Weller. \"So, then, is playing golf today leisure? Leisure turns out to be this loose and sloppy concept. When you talk to other people and think about these things in a new way, it becomes really interesting.\" Weller, together with Catherine Yeh, an associate professor of Chinese, and Eugenio Menegon, an associate professor of Chinese history and world history, both in the College of Arts & Sciences, has launched a three-year proj-ect titled \"Leisure and Social Change: The Transcultural Flow of Concepts, Institutions and Practices across Asia.\" Fifteen faculty members from six departments will meet regularly to present new research and look for areas of collaboration, with visits from invited guest speakers from other academic institutions. Each year, an international workshop is planned on one of three focus areas: Leisure and the State; Leisure and Money; and Leisure, Gender, and the Generation Gap. The first conference will be held at BU, the second in Europe, and the third in Asia. The goal is to examine leisure from a multidisciplinary perspective, as well as explore how concepts and practices of leisure change\u2014or don't\u2014across boundaries of geogra- phy, time, nationality, culture, and class. Ultimately, project participants hope to collect the scholarship produced over three years in one or two edited books. CAF\u00e9 CULTURE IN JAPAN A CoLoRFUL MEMBER oF ThE ChINESE LITERATILEISURE IN ASIA ACR oSS ThE CENTURIESThe way in which leisure often holds up a mirror to life, reflecting larger political and socioeconomic trends, can be seen in T ateishi harumi's painting Clover (1934), which captures the bittersweet mood of Japanese society as it transitioned from expansive imperial optimism to an increasingly militaristic authoritarianism in the first half of the 20th century.

(continued on next page)All About Asia 22 RESEARCh AT BoSToN UNIvERSITy 2010 Research Asia \"Not much has been done on the topic of leisure in Asian Studies,\" says Menegon. \"So this project will give us not only a comparative perspective, but a space in which to say new things.\" But why study leisure activities\u2014the things that people do in their free time\u2014at all? Aren't hobbies and pastimes as peripheral as they are pleasurable? Actually, suggests Weller, the periphery can often serve as a helpful mirror of what's going on at the center. Leisure\u2014whether it's playing soccer or practicing calligraphy or watching television\u2014is inevitably more than just leisure: it's a reflec- tion of everything from politics and economics to culture and human relations. Those connections, as well as the shifting meaning and kinds of leisure over time, make it a fascinating topic. \"We are at the beginning, not the end,\" Weller explains. \"It could be that we end up with a definition of leisure, or an argument about it, which could be more important. But we can certainly work through the questions together and come up with things we couldn't have on our own.\"Surprising Spaces: Caf\u00e9 Culture in Japan Soon after Merry white arrived in Japan in the mid-1960s for the first time, she was invited out to a local coffeehouse in T okyo. \"It was a dark, cavernous, French-style artists' caf\u00e9. And the first thing I noticed was that there were white sheets hanging all over the walls,\" she says. \"Soon after we arrived, we were asked to take off our clothes.\" Artists at the caf\u00e9 painted White's body with bright, cobalt blue paint, and then she and the other participants became living paintbrushes, \u00e0 la Yves Klein, pressing themselves against the white sheets. \"This was not the Japan I expected,\" she says. \"It never is.\" Since that first trip to Japan, White, a professor in the Anthropology Department, has become a leading expert on Japanese culture, publishing multiple books on the country's education system and popular culture. And that surprising episode at the coffeehouse has always stayed with her, inspiring her forthcoming book with the Univer-sity of California Press on the role of the urban coffeehouse in Japanese society. To research her book, White became a regular at 14 caf\u00e9s in Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe over four years, and spent hours upon hours interviewing customers as well as coffee masters (the people we know as baristas). She enrolled in a coffeehouse management course, so she could learn more about the logistics that went into running these prolific public institutions\u2014there are often multiple coffeehouses on a single city block in Japan. She also spent time with Japanese coffee roasters and importers and read primary documents from the 1600s when coffee was first brought to Japan, including Dutch journals that recounted Japanese prostitutes trying coffee for the first time. What White discovered is that coffee, not green tea, is the foremost social beverage in Japan. There have been coffeehouses in Japan since the 1880s, and the country is the third-largest consumer of coffee, after the United States and Germany. The first coffeehouse chain in the world, Paulista, opened in Tokyo in 1908. Japan is also the frequent testing ground for new varieties of coffee before they go on to be marketed throughout the world. \"The Japanese have higher coffee standards than anywhere else,\" White says. \"So if your coffee can pass there, it can pass anywhere.\" Specialty coffee in Japan is usually served using a hand pour, rather than brewed by machine. And the Japanese prefer blended coffee. \"This preference comes from the sense that a real master can 'play' the different notes of different coffees together, making a symphony of flavor,\" says White. The whole process, she says, is very handmade, very artisanal\u2014as much a cultural experience as a beverage. Recently, caf\u00e9s in the United States and Europe have begun to use Japanese techniques to brew and serve coffee. \"What interests me is coffee as an industry in Japan, but also this new export of Japanese-style coffee from a place that people really don't think of as a coffee-drinking country,\" she says. And it's not just this prevailing image of the Japanese as the quintes- sential tea drinkers that White hopes to challenge. She also hopes her work will confront other common stereotypes. \"We have the idea that the Japanese are all incredibly fastidious people who sleep and work and don't take time off,\" she says. But Japanese caf\u00e9s show another, more dynamic side of Japanese culture, playing a central role in the country's arts and cultural scene. And unlike the United States, where you'll usually find patrons firmly fixated on their laptop screens, the coffeehouse in Japan has remained a vibrant social center. That said, Japanese caf\u00e9s can also serve as a personal time-out space, where an individual can find solitude in public, a rare thing in what White calls a \"densely relational society.\" Whether Japanese coffeehouses are used as a place to exchange ideas or a space in which to contemplate them alone, White believes caf\u00e9s provide an illuminating glance at the country as a whole. \"These are creative, innovative spaces. Unlike many other institutions in Japanese society where people have their identities given to them, the caf\u00e9 is a free, flexible place where there is no operative role that governs you. There are stories in the coffeehouses and caf\u00e9s of Japan that people wouldn't expect. There are a lot of surprises,\" she says. \"And I think these surprises ultimately extend beyond the caf\u00e9 environment.\" while tea is the tradi- tional drink of Japan, the country is also home to a thriving coffee industry and hundreds of caf\u00e9s\u2014 as well as some of the most discriminating coffee connoisseurs in the world. \"This was not the Japan I expected. It never is.\" Eugenio Menegon Catherine Yeh Robert Weller Merry White The moment of triumph in Chinese emperor Quianlong's stag hunting expedition is depicted on a silk scroll by Father Giuseppe Castiglione (1688-1766), left, while Mei Lanfang performs as Meng y uehua in the opera The Pavilion of Royal Monument.

But the literal translation is more grim: \"dead nature.\" For Allen, the two connotations are equally apt. her photogravures of objects that have lost their original purpose and significance offer a study in obsolescence; both her subjects and her method are remnants of a bygone time. Several of those images form a link to and reflection on her Native American heritage. Allen can trace her Sioux ancestors back six generations. But it was only in the last decade that she began exploring this background in her art. \"I'm the product of assimilation into white society,\" she says. \"Beginning with my great-great-grand- mother, all the women married white men. I didn't live the reservation life. I grew up an hour outside Philadelphia. I've always been very aware and proud of my rich history, but I see myself as a white person.

I only started making work about that history after a Navajo friend of mine said, 'Lynne, come out of the closet.'\" Allen's art has always dealt with psychological and social issues: the home-less, Alzheimer's patients, prisoners. \"The common denominator in my work is the underdog,\" she says. \"And I didn't realize until I was 50 that my passion, my empathy, comes from my mother and the women before her.\" her Nature Morte show marked the first time Allen created photogravures, using an exacting printmaking technique in which a photo is etched onto a copper plate. \"The technique was invented in the 1830s, which is about the time they started herding Native Americans,\" she says. \"By 1860, Native Americans were no longer roaming the plains, but were living on reservations. So I used a medium from that period when these people were no longer valid, to create images of things that are no longer valid today.\" For instance, she juxtaposed moccasins and shoe forms. \"Moccasins are still being made, but Native Americans don't wear them anymore, except for ceremony,\" she says. \"And shoes are no longer made with shoe forms. I put these pictures next to each other because they represent two sides of me. And they're objects that no longer carry their utilitarian purpose. They're artifacts.\" A photo of a log cabin with a flamingo in front of it is about progress and change. \"w e've come from the log cabin to people having flamingos in their front yard. But to what extent does that change impinge on other people's culture?\" The photogravures challenge people to find their own interpretations. \"I tell my students that good art is like a good movie,\" says Allen. \"when you go to a good movie, you think about it for a week. y ou want a piece of art to do that too.\" She teaches one class each semester, an artisanal bookmaking class that requires students to produce text as well as images. It is, she says, a course about ideas. \"I try to get them to delve inside themselves to find out who they are so that they can make work that is meaningful to them. Most 19- and 20-year-olds don't think about them-selves as subjects. w e have discussions about what they have read or are reading. I have a colleague from the College of Arts & Sciences w riting Program come in to do projects with my students about how to write and how to put stories together. I want them to understand that throughout history, artists' work has been about themselves and the world they live in, and their reaction to that world. The most important thing to me is getting students to think.\" Allen says that her own work, regard- less of the subject, has always been meant \"to educate the public about certain issues. Empathy is the power to imagine a world outside your own experience, and although the truth is not always pretty, the hunger for it is.\" She is currently making a series of small books, only 2 inches by 2 inches, \"rewriting the history\" of how the w est was won. \"I want people to understand that the history they learned in school is not the entire history. history is always written by the victor. I want my work to be good, but I also want people to delve deeper into the 'why' of what I'm making. I've never done anything for money. I've never done anything for fame. I've just done it because I had to satisfy myself.\" RRecollection of Things Past A Scholar and a Gentleman wu Dacheng may be the most interesting Chinese historical figure you've never heard of. The 19th-century government official was a scholar, artist, collector, and patron of the arts, who counted among his friends some of the most important politicians of the day. But for Art History Professor Qianshen Bai, Wu is more than just a colorful member of the Chinese literati\u2014he is also a symbol of its ultimate decline. Bai has published dozens of articles on Wu and his contemporaries and is currently at work on a book. His research has taken him to places ranging from nearby New Hampshire to distant China, in search of materials\u2014paintings, seals, diaries, and the like\u2014on Wu and his circle. Upcoming trips are planned for Japan and South Korea, where there are many enthusiastic collectors of Wu's work. Wu's life, family, and relation- ships, as well as his work as both an artist and a civil servant, exemplify some of the major changes happening in China during the 19th century, says Bai. Therein lies the source of the continuing interest in him. Born in 1835 in Suzhou, then the capital of arts and culture in China, Wu came from a wealthy, well- connected merchant family. In 1868, he passed the civil service examination required of all government officials and went on to become governor of the Guangdong and Hunan provinces. In that time, he also established himself as an important artist and calligrapher and a very prominent collector, compiling a massive assem- bly of art and antiquities.These artistic pursuits were not merely idle pastimes; knowledge and mastery of art were expected of govern- ment officials. \"Calligraphy, scholarship, and artistic skill were all a necessary part of the political life,\" says Bai. \"There was an idea that China was ruled by educated men, so self-cultivation became critical.\" The entrance exam for civil servants contained numerous questions on poetry, art, and literature. If a candidate had poor calligraphy skills, officials would refuse even to look at his test. But over the course of Wu's lifetime, this emphasis on artistic self-cultivation dissipated. \"China was once ruled by people with a humanities background,\" explains Bai. \"But with modernization and increasing confrontation with the Western world, China was forced to change.\" Part of that shift was toward a modern education system, with an emphasis on specialty subjects like science, engineer-ing, and the law\u2014subjects previously considered unimport- ant for the governing class to know. Three years after Wu's death in 1902, the 1,300-year-old civil examination system was abolished, an official sign of the irreversible decline of the scholar-official class. Ironically, Wu and many of his contemporaries sup- ported the very modernization and globalization efforts that led to the end of Chinese cultural and political life as they knew it. The resulting, profound implications for the relationship between politics and art are what Bai hopes to tease out through his examination of Wu's life. \"Wu represents the last generation of this class of people,\" he explains. \"As the structure of the elite changed, so did the fate of Chinese art.\" RBy sheR yl Flatow \" I tell my students that good art is like a good movie. when you go to a good movie, you think about it for a week. you want a piece of art to do that too.\" In an age when politicians were expected to be men of arts and letters, w u Dacheng's success as a civil servant depended on his talents as a painter.

Old-World Opera BY VickY Waltz ketty Nez was only six months old when her family immigrated to the United States from the Former yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Nonetheless, the music she composes is rooted in her homeland's musical traditions. \"My father is an amateur violinist, and my aunt is a pianist,\" Nez says. \"When I was a child, they would play duets.\" A musical prodigy of sorts, she took up the piano at age three, with her father's encouragement. As a teenager, she practiced upwards of 10 hours a day: Bach, Brahms, Beethoven, Mozart. Today, Nez is an assistant professor at Boston Uni- versity's College of Fine Arts, where she teaches classes in musical composition, theory, orchestration, and analysis. While versed in numerous musical genres including clas- sical, chamber, contemporary, and electronic forms, her most recent compositions explore the music of the cultures surrounding her birthplace. Mostly an agricultural and pastoral people, Macedo- nians passed on their folk songs orally through generation after generation of cattle farmers and sheepherders. \"Few villagers could read,\" Nez says, \"so they preserved their histories through spoken stories and song.\" Since the fall of socialism in Eastern Europe, contem- porary folk and pop musicians throughout the Balkans have tapped into the region's time-honored folk songs. Among the most famous earlier projects\u2014and one that particularly inspired Nez\u2014is Postcards from the 1930s, a setting for violin and piano that uses transcriptions of Bosnian and Herzegovinan folk songs by renowned Hungarian com- poser and ethnomusicologist B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k. Nez is referencing those traditions in a different medium: opera. \"The opera project is a by-product of my everlasting curiosity for the sounds and rhythms of my own ethnic background,\" she says, \"a mixture of Slovenian and Slavic Macedonian.\"Thanks to generous support from the BU Humani- ties Foundation, the opera, called The Fiddler and the Old Woman of Rumelia, will be performed in spring 2011 in collaboration with Xanthos, a young professional ensemble directed by violinist Brenda Van der Merwe. The story begins with the title. \"Rumelia is the name of the former Ottoman province which encompassed the Balkan areas whose music I'm studying,\" Nez explains. \"And the capital was Bitola, my mother's hometown.\" While most of the opera will be sung in English, Nez may use some of the original language with subtitles. \"It depends on how difficult it is for the singers,\" she says. At this point, she does not intend to incorporate any traditional folk instruments into the production; instead, Nez plans to imitate their sounds with Western ones. \"The violin mimics the sound of the gadulka, a Bulgarian bowed instrument,\" she says, \"and the oboe and saxophone can fill in for bagpipes.\" At present, Nez is working on the plot. \"I'm flesh- ing out the intriguing stories which the folk songs seem to allude to,\" she says. \"My cast of characters includes a village ing\u00e9nue, a dashing and murderous outlaw, a spry card-telling Roma, and a crusty old epic singer. The chal- lenge is to preserve the musical sources as untouched transcriptions\u2014a musical photograph, if you will.\" This is not Nez's first opera. While a composer-in- residence at the \u00c9cole Nationale de Musique in Mont-b\u00e9liard, France, she wrote A Devolutionary Opera: Drama in 540 Seconds, which premiered in 2003 at Munich's annual ADevantgarde Festival. A collaboration of seven composers, each of whom contributed a chapter, the opera is about two scientists who study the effects of a viral epi- demic among humans. Nez chose in her piece for the virus to cause people to behave like animals, and she incorporated iconic cartoon characters, including Batman, Catwoman, the Pink Panther, and King Kong, into its narrative. \"The Fiddler and the Old Woman of Rumelia will be nothing like that,\" she says with a laugh. \" the challenge is to preserve the musical sources as untouched transcriptions\u2014 a musical photograph, if you will.\"Web extra Listen to some of ketty Nez's recordings atwww.bu.edu/research/magazine\u00e7 New and Noteworthy Assistant professors thrive in a growing faculty.29 www.BU.EDU /RESEARCh Straight T alk and Spin By kARINE ABAL yAN For decades, health educators have been trying to rise above the hubbub of college life with wellness-centered campaigns that urge students to eat better, exercise more, sleep longer, and otherwise adopt healthy behaviors. But often these efforts meet with little success, says Cheryl Ann Lambert, an assistant professor in the College of Communication's Department of Mass Communication, Advertising & Public Relations. \"These fabulous, wonder-ful messages\u2014whether they're about alcohol or sexual health or nutritional health\u2014exist separate and apart from the students.\" she explains. \"I am trying to figure out how to bridge the divide.\" Employing both quantitative and qualitative research methods, Lambert hopes to understand how students respond to the health- related information they receive from various sources. What makes some outreach tactics more effective than others? And in a landscape inundated with advertisements and announce- ments, what support can health educators provide to help students sort out the jumble? \"All of us want the same thing: we want the students to be healthy,\" says Lambert. \"But are we going about it the right way?\" In her latest project\u2014a study exploring sexual health attitudes and behaviors on college campuses, start- ing with BU\u2014Lambert partnered with Teri Aronowitz, a nurse-practitioner in Student Health Services who is also an adjunct clinical professor at the College of Health & Rehabilita- tion Sciences: Sargent College and an assistant professor in the Department of Family Medicine at the BU School of Medicine. Last spring, Lambert and Aronowitz designed and imple-mented an online survey to gauge stu- dent opinions about different aspects of sexual health. They followed up the survey with focus groups, where students gave more in-depth interviews on the topic. In the next phase of the research, Lambert says, the findings will be used to create an intervention program focusing on \"how to respond and react when people are suffering from rape and sexual trauma, and to teach healthy sexual behaviors and awareness.\" Lambert's work in communications extends beyond health issues to examine other ways specific information is distributed and processed in today's world. A public rela-tions manager who worked for seven years before pursuing graduate studies, Lambert has developed an interest in how the public relations profession is depicted and perceived outside the field. \"People have a skewed understanding of public rela- tions,\" she says, pointing to the prevalence of negative catchphrases associated with the industry, such as \"public relations nightmare\" or \"public relations problem.\" \"That got me thinking about why that is, and what does it mean for our students who are studying public rela-tions.\" In particular, Lambert has been studying portrayals of public relations professionals in film. From Samantha Jones on Sex and the City to the heroine of Bridget Jones's Diary, PR agents in the movies appear oversexed, flighty, shallow, or generally lacking the commitment and ethical principles their jobs require. These observations, coupled with earlier work on the subject, inspired Lambert to launch a study on how gradu-ate communications students relate to these silver screen stereotypes. She is working on the project with Candace White, an associate professor in the School of Advertis-ing and Public Relations at the University of Tennessee- Knoxville, where Lambert earned her PhD. Lambert and White hope to present their conclusions at a conference in the fall. In the meantime, Lambert has been providing students with a less biased model of the public relations sphere, and encouraging them to turn to organizations like the Public Relations Society of America as a guide to the standards to which PR professionals should adhere. \"We are advocates on behalf of clients or companies or brands,\" she says. \"But while we're doing that, we can't leave our ethics at the door. We can't focus too much on the client at the expense of the public and what the public needs.\" Research Assistant professors Secrets of the Stars By MARk DwoRTZAN Can the smallest stars in the night sky shed light on the structure, dynamics, and evolution of the en-tire Milky w ay galaxy? Assistant Professor of Astronomy Andrew west is staking his career on it, and the data he has collected and analyzed so far suggest that he is onto something. Occupying between one- thousandth and one-tenth the volume of the Sun, red dwarfs are the small- est stars in the Milky Way. They are also the coolest and least luminous. But what they lack in size, tempera- ture, and brightness, they make up for in number, with red dwarfs accounting for 70 percent of all stars in the galaxy. \"These stars are very dim but fuel efficient, and on average could burn for trillions of years,\" says West, who dubs red dwarfs the \"VWs of the Milky Way.\" \"Because they're so huge in number and last almost forever, large samples of them can allow you to probe the shape, structure, and evolution of our own galaxy like no other stars.\" Drawing on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and other deep, all-sky surveys that show millions of red dwarfs extending across the night sky, West and his collaborators have built a sample set of about 50 million. Liken- ing the Milky Way galaxy to a Frisbee, he has devised a way to determine the likely age of each star based on its position with respect to the center line of the Frisbee, that part of the galaxy where all stars are born. \"As stars age, they interact with other stars and cold molecular gas, and their velocity increases,\" West explains. \"These aging stars gradually move away from the central plane of the galaxy. At any one moment, the youngest stars tend to orbit closer to the plane; the further you go from the plane, the older the stars are.\" By deducing the relative ages of the red dwarfs and obtaining light spectra that reveal information about their physical composition, tem- perature, and magnetic fields, West is tracing how the Milky Way has evolved over time. To achieve that objective, he is leading a research team that includes BU graduate and undergraduate students, Astronomy Department colleague Professor Daniel Clemens, and other astrono- mers from Cornell, MIT, and the University of Washington.Noting that red dwarfs are the most common stars around which planets are likely to be found, West is homing in on how old a star needs to be for its magnetic field (and resulting large stellar flares) to dissipate suf - ficiently to sustain orbiting planets, and for its atmosphere to contain heavy elements indicative of the presence of carbon, oxygen, and other elements that support life. \"While we already understand the basic sequence of the chemical and magnetic evolution of stars in the galaxy, it's the timescale for that evolution that's not well known,\" says West. \"The more we learn about this timescale, the more we will come to understand about the abundance of stars that can support habitable planets in the galaxy.\" RESEARCh AT BoSToN UNIvERSITy 2010 28Cheryl Ann Lambert Andrew West An edge-on view of a spiral galaxy shows stars divided into strata, with the younger stars located mostly in the middle layers and older stars in the outer layers.

In his case, though, the \"words\" in question are the distinct vocalizations of a songbird, represented in visual form. Gardner, an assistant professor of biology in the College of Arts & Sciences, uses these images to under- stand how birds build and retain the songs they use to communicate with one another. His work could shed light on how the neural circuits of learning and memory are encoded and maintained not only in birds, but also in humans\u2014potentially boosting our understanding of the normal and diseased states of the human brain. Gardner has chosen to focus his investigations on birds, rather than laboratory mice, or even humans, because few organisms exhibit such a quantifiable behavior. \"In the last two years we have succeeded in translating sound into a new kind of image to capture the structure and the variants of birdsong,\" he says, \"and we're now at the point where we can detect subtle changes in specific birdsongs.\" Toward that end, Gardner subjects a bird colony of about 300 zebra finches and canaries\u2014kept in soundproofed cages\u2014to a variety of computer-controlled, quantitative behavioral experiments in his Laboratory of Neural Circuit Formation. In one experiment, Gardner studied canaries raised in isolation from birdsong. While \"tutoring\" the birds with computer-generated, synthetic songs that departed from species-typical songs, he and his lab recorded every sound the birds uttered through their development. Initially, the subjects imitated the synthetic songs with great accuracy, but as they matured, they reverted to species-typical songs, even in the absence of other canaries. \"There's a complex program that ultimately builds each species-specific song,\" Gardner says, noting that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the pro- cess. \"We're interested in determining the local neuronal rules that govern this amazing process.\" To home in on these rules, Gardner is now invest- igating regions of the brain that encode song patterns. These areas produce a dynamic pattern of song while the birds are singing\u2014and also, surprisingly, when they are asleep. Gardner has produced time-lapsed images of neuron growth in vivo which show the development of new neuronal processes in sleep. Gardner hopes to learn more about the growth of these processes by introducing small perturbations to the spon-taneous activity that occurs during birds' sleep, and then observing the impact of those perturbations on their neural networks and songs. As the bird dreams of its own songs, or sings upon awakening, a computer detects the sleeping pattern and triggers a stimulating electrode or implanted optical fiber to induce slight changes in neuronal electrical activity at specific locations in the song pathways. A brain- machine interface implant measures the activity. \"If we can increase or decrease the neuronal activity of the bird during sleep, we can see if there's a change in the sequential order\u2014and creativity\u2014of the songs it produces,\" says Gardner, noting that such studies could help us under-stand how similar neuronal changes in humans might impact our performance during the day.

As the seizure evolves, the number of connections in the network changes.Zeroing in on Epilepsy By vICky wALTZ Mark kramer always had an interest in public health. his father was a doctor, and his mother and grand-mother were nurses. while his aversion to blood dashed any aspirations of attending medical school, he did not let it deter him from seeking a career in medicine. \"You don't have to be a physician to have a clinical impact,\" Kramer says. \"You can be a biologist, engineer, mathematician.\" Or, in Kramer's case, a physicist. As a doctoral student in the University of California, Berkeley's program in Applied Science and Technology, Kramer helped develop a mathematical model that describes what happens in the brain during an epileptic seizure. The purpose of the study, published in the March 2005 issue of the Journal of the Royal Society of London Interface, was to help neurologists better understand and treat epilepsy. When epilepsy patients fail to respond to various drug treatments, Kramer explains, doctors may take an alterna- tive course of action. \"They remove the part of the brain that causes the seizure,\" he says. While numerous measures are undertaken to ensure patient safety, the surgery is nonetheless invasive, and it is not always accurate. According to a 2007 Cleveland Clinic study, 60 percent of patients who have the surgery continue to have seizures. Now an assistant professor of mathematics and statis- tics, Kramer wants to reverse those numbers. To that end, he is using his background in math and physics to help doc- tors at Massachusetts General Hospital determine which parts of the brain to target. \"Up until now,\" he says, \"the primary way to analyze data retrieved from the brains of epilepsy patients has been through a painstaking visual inspection. Epileptolo-gists stare at complicated traces of brain activity and try to determine where in the brain the seizure is starting.\" Before surgery, neurologists must map the region where the patient's seizure originates to ensure that they remove only what is necessary. This involves lifting a section of the skull and putting electrodes directly on the surface of the brain. \"The patients stay in the hospital for about a week,\" Kramer says, \"during which time they may experience a number of seizures.\" Kramer and his collaborators study the voltage data collected from the electrodes using sophisticated math-ematical techniques. \"Rather than looking at individual voltage traces,\" he says, \"we're examining them collectively. Are there any relationships between those traces? Is there any sort of pattern?\" While the recordings reveal the consequences of abnormal brain activity, he continues, they do not identify the cause. \"If we understand why and how seizures pro- gress over the surface of the brain,\" he says, \"eventually we may be able to prevent the seizure by disrupting the activ - ity preemptively with medication or stimulation.\" To date, Kramer's team has analyzed only a handful of seizures from a small group of patients. It is a minuscule percentage of the 50 million people worldwide who suffer from the disease, but still a strong start. \"The scientific pro-cess is filled with wrong turns,\" Kramer says, \"but I truly believe we're on our way.\" R Tim Gardner Mark Kramer synthetic tutor song Juvenile imitations Gardner and his colleagues notated the song patterns of juvenile canaries, top diagram, that had never heard normal species-specific songs, and found that they imitated abnormal synthetic songs with great accuracy, even when the tutor songs lacked phrasing, or what Gardner's team calls \"short stereotyped syllables\" that are repeated as the bird sings.

Millions more are at risk, or already have a pre-diabetes condition. A chronic but treatable disorder, diabetes can strike anyone from the young to the aged, male and female, and in particular, African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and certain other ethnic groups. T o help those living with the disorder and to prevent further cases, Boston University researchers are working on a number of different fronts, from developing an artificial pancreas that automatically controls blood sugar and insulin in type 1 diabetes, to identifying new risk and treatment factors for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, socioeconomic factors regarding the high-risk population of African American women, and genetic loci that warrant further study.

A small sensor under the skin monitors blood sugar, a pump delivers a calculated amount of insulin, and a software program tells the first two components what to do. The device, worn externally, is called an artificial pancreas. It promises to revolutionize the management of type 1 diabetes\u2014an autoimmune disease in which the pan- creas does not produce the insulin needed to carry blood sugar into cells\u2014and to improve the quality of life for those who suffer from the disorder. \"Most people currently on pump therapy will use the artificial pancreas,\" predicts Edward Damiano, an associ- ate professor of biomedical engineering and a co-principal investigator on the artificial pancreas project, which has received funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust, and Wallace H. Coulter Foundation. Damiano has done his homework on insulin pump therapy. His 11-year-old son, David, wears two insulin pumps, one just below each hip. The pumps deliver insulin under the skin rapidly, which is more convenient for an active adolescent than the injections that most type 1 diabetes patients need daily. It was David's condition, diagnosed when he was a baby, that prompted Damiano to seek out a new research direction, one that would benefit his son and diabetes patients everywhere. \"I saw a role for myself in diabetes,\" he said. \"I knew I had a certain skill set that could be brought to bear on the disease.\" Damiano, his former student, Firas El-Khatib, now a BU senior research scientist, and other colleagues designed the \"smarts\" of the artificial pancreas system\u2014that is, the computer program that regulates the device. They were the first academicians to receive an investigational device exemption from the Food and Drug Administration to test a blood-glucose control algorithm in clinical trials. The posi-tive outcomes of those 2009 clinical trials were published in the journal Science Translational Medicine. If the second round of clinical trials are as successful as the first, Damiano estimates that the artificial pancreas will be available for commercial production in 2014. He hopes that the device will be approved by the time his son reaches college age. Damiano is excited about the clinical trials\u2014begun in June at Massachusetts General Hospital, where Damiano's co-principal investigator Steven Russell is an endocrinolo-gist\u2014because of the younger subjects. Half of the patients in the clinical trial are between 12 and 18 years of age; the rest are 18 and older. The study is twice as long and larger in scope than the previous trial. However, the real test for the device is scheduled for spring 2011, when a third clinical trial will incorporate exercise into the subjects' regimen and allow them to con-sume food as they do at home, rather than in a prescribed format. This trial will also eliminate the IV pole and desktop computer currently used to operate the artificial pancreas; instead, the necessary software will be imbedded on a computer chip built into the unit, paving the way for a portable device ready for commercial production. Although the artificial pancreas is being tested specifi- cally for patients with type 1 diabetes, Damiano is optimis-tic about its eventual use for everyone with the condition. \"I think it also will work very well with people with type 2 diabetes,\" he said. \"Anyone on insulin therapy will benefit from this device.\" C256H381N65O79S6 Edward Damiano, left, and Firas El-khatib are develop- ing an artificial pancreas that improves on current insulin pump technology, top.

Research diabetes 36 RESEARCh AT BoSToN UNIvERSITy 2010 37 www.BU.EDU /RESEARChLocation Is Everything African American women who live in low income neighborhoods have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes than do African Americans who live in more advantaged neigh borhoods\u2014even if they have high educational levels themselves. \"Where a woman lives, regardless of her own educa- tion and income, has an effect,\" explains Professor Julie Palmer, senior epidemiologist at the Slone Epidemiol- ogy Center and a co-principal investigator of the Black Women's Health Study, who discovered the correlation between area of residence and diabetes risk. \"This finding is important because so many black women continue to live in disadvantaged neighborhoods even while they work in professional jobs and earn adequate incomes. Efforts to reduce the alarming rate of diabetes in African Ameri-can women need to focus not only on individual lifestyle changes but also on improving conditions in disadvantaged neighborhoods.\" The Black Women's Health Study\u2014which has been fol- lowing 59,000 African American women from 17 states since 1995, thanks to more than $30 million in funding\u2014is helping to shed light on why black women are twice as likely to have type 2 diabetes as non-Hispanic white women. Palmer and colleagues Lynn Rosenberg, associate director of the Slone Epidemiology Center, and Lucile Julie Palmer Adams-Campbell, of Georgetown University, have hypoth- esized that the association between neighborhood socio- economic status and diabetes risk may occur because neighborhoods with a lower socioeconomic status lack access to grocery stores that sell wholesome fruits, vegeta- bles, and other foods, as well as access to safe areas for walk - ing and other exercise. Obesity is one of the primary factors for developing diabetes, so maintaining a healthy weight, eating a nutritious diet, and engaging in regular exercise are key to preventing the disease. The study found that African American women living in neighborhoods with the lowest socioeconomic status\u2014as determined by the U.S. Census Bureau's \"geo coding\"\u2014had a 1.65 times higher risk of contracting diabetes, after factoring in individual risk factors such as education, age, income, and household size. Taking into account physical activity and caloric intake reduced the association, indicating that physical activity and diet explain at least part of the link between type of neighborhood and risk of diabetes. Palmer said that over 5,000 Black Women's Health Study participants have developed diabetes since the study began in 1995. Surveys, mailed every two years, track how the women's health and habits have changed, and gather data on weight, diet, birth control, smoking habits, and the development of disease. \"Our study is powerful because we know about behaviors that occurred before diabetes developed,\" says Palmer. \"We are particularly inter-ested in social factors and how they influence diabetes.\"Y ou Are What Y ou Eat Although food additives are not toxic, they have never been thoroughly tested with respect to biochemical interactions in the body.

In one of the first stud-ies undertaken at BU's new Center for Molecular Discovery, monoglycerides were shown to stimulate the production of insulin in beta cells. \"Human beings are constantly being exposed to new drugs and food additives, and these drugs and additives have never been tested for chronic effects on systems such as metabolic health,\" says Barbara Corkey, vice chair for research at the BU School of Medicine, who co-founded the center with Chemis-try Professor John A. Porco, Jr., and Michael Pratt, director of translational research and corporate rela- tions in BU's Technology Development Office. Led by Director Sarah Haigh Molina, the Center for Molecular Discovery gives BU researchers access to a process used by the pharmaceutical industry known as a \"high-throughput screening,\" in which thousands of small molecule compounds can be screened for physiological effect (e.g., normalization of insulin secretion) using cell-based or biochemi- cal assays. The rapid process can identify active compounds that change a particular biomolecular pathway. \"The goal is to discover and develop drugs that will benefit mankind,\" says Corkey. And, she contin-ues, \"If the physiology is relevant, the food industry might revisit using monoglycerides, the same way the industry decreased the fat content in many foods. The food industry needs absolute proof to change, so we need to do a lot more research.\" Barbara CorkeyProximity to grocery stores that sell whole- some food may be a greater factor in deter - mining risk for type-2 diabetes among African American women than socioeconomic status.

An associate professor of philosophy, theology, and ethics in the School of Theology, w ildman trained as a mathemati- cian and physicist before becoming a scholar of religion, and he has continued to study and write about the intersection of the two fields. \"For me it's just a habit to think about everything together at once. If you have an insight into religion that comes from evolutionary theory, why not think it right alongside of the thoughts you have that come from the humanities or from reading beautiful poetry?\" he asks. \"It's quite common for people to think there's a sharp conflict, but when you put people who are experts in these fields together, the research is transformed, allowing for precision of understanding and for breadth and richness and depth of understanding as well.\" The neuroscientist Patrick McNamara first became interested in the scientific study of religion when he was working with Parkinson's patients in the 1990s. In his work with people with Alzheimer's, McNamara had seen religion bring solace in the face of a devastating neurological condition. But his Parkinson's patients rarely relied on their faith to cope with their disease. Before their illness struck, these patients were no less religious than other people. why, he asked, were they less religious after they were afflicted? The question led McNamara, who today is director of the Evolutionary Neurobehavior Laboratory in the Department of Neurology at the BU School of Medicine, into the nascent community of researchers using science to study religion. he and w ildman soon joined forces, first as research collabora-tors and then, in 2007, as cofounders of the independent nonprofit Institute for the Biocultural Study of Religion (IBCSR). As befits a collaboration between a neuroscientist and a theologian, the institute's mission includes both supporting the scientific study of religion and exploring the ramifications of that research through several outreach initiatives, including its website, IBCSR.org. Beginning next year, McNamara and w ildman will introduce the field's first scientific journal, Religion, Brain, and Behavior, which they will co-edit with the University of Connecticut anthropologist Richard Sosis. \"Biological approaches\u2014 including genetics, neuroscience, the cognitive sciences, and the psychological sciences\u2014are revolutionizing our under - standing of religion,\" McNamara says. \"The institute is unique for trying to grapple with the wider implications of what science is telling us about religion.\" Those implications range from ethical and philosophical, to political and biomedi-cal. McNamara's research with colleagues at the v A hospital in Boston, for example, led him to identify the area of the brain activated when people think or talk about religion. The finding has ontological implications in that it supports the theory that religion has an evolutionary history. It also has clinical import: knowing the brain circuitry involved in religious cognition could lead to more targeted treatments for people who suffer from certain psychoses. In another project, w ildman and McNamara are working with researchers from harvard University to seek quantitative answers to such questions as What makes a religious group turn violent? \"w e're com- mitted to high-level research, and we're committed to the generous understanding of anything that's as intricate and beautiful as religion,\" says w ildman. \"we're also committed to the critique of any - thing that's as dangerous and large as religion.\" Utilizing methods from evolutionary biology, they are studying Anabaptist sects of the European Reformation and modern Sunni Islamic groups of northeastern Afghanistan to try to identify the character - istics of a religious group that might lead it to turn to violence. Eventually, they hope, their findings will provide policymakers with the intervention tools they need to prevent future bloodshed. key to a nuanced, precise, and edifying scientific study of religion, w ildman and McNamara say, is interdisciplinary collaboration. They hope in the coming years to expand the involvement of their Boston University colleagues\u2014behavioral econo- mists, historians, anthropologists, religious scholars, art historians and artists them- selves, and specialists in any number of other areas\u2014in the IBCSR's work. \"This field is building bridges across the disciplines, and it's when you put these disparate subjects together that you get, I think, the deepest insights into the way religion works,\" says w ildman, who also directs an interdisciplinary graduate program in religion and science within BU's Division of Religious and Theological Studies. \"T o be evolutionarily and biologi- cally conditioned to respond to the universe, to the world, to your experience in a particular way is directly relevant to why you believe what you believe, what you're willing to die for, what you're willing to kill for, what you're willing to save.\" RBy tRiCia BRiCK \" If you have an insight into religion that comes from evolutionary theory, why not think it right alongside of the thoughts you have that come from the humanities or from reading beautiful poetry?\" Patrick McNamara Wesley Wildman Snip By Snip A BU biostatistician is making headway in another piece of the diabetes puzzle: genes that play a signifi-cant role in the disorder. \"Discovering nine new loci was a big leap,\" says School of Public Health Professor Jos\u00e9e Dupuis, who was a first co-author on a January 2010 article in Nature Genetics that identified nine new genetic variants affecting glucose levels. \"Researchers were finding one at a time before that.\" The article was based on an exhaustive study by the Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin Related Traits Consortium (MAGIC), and funded in part by the National Institutes of Health. The international, large-scale study analyzed samples from 54 previous studies involving 122,000 individuals of European descent. The studies looked for associations between fasting glucose level and common single nucleo-tide polymorphism (SNP , pronounced \"snip\"), a DNA sequence variation, by scanning the DNA of thousands of nondiabetic individuals. Of the nine genetic variant locations, three contributed to significant risk of acquiring type 2 diabetes; three did not increase the risk; and three indicated only a moderate risk. Glucose levels in the blood were measured after the subjects had fasted for eight hours or more, so that ingested food did not influence the test results. \"We can find genes that affect diabetes by studying fasting glucose in nondiabetics,\" she said. \"But every - thing that affects fasting glucose in nondiabetics may not increase your risk of developing diabetes.\" In May, Dupuis learned that NIH funding had been awarded for a five-year follow-up study. The collaborative study, led by endocrinologist and geneticist David Altshuler of Harvard and the Broad Institute, will involve four sites: Boston University, Massachusetts General Hospital, the George Washington University, and the University of Mississippi. Dupuis's part in the project, along with biostastis- tics PhD student Han Chen, will be to analyze data from the Framingham Heart Study at BU and provide analytic support to the Jackson Heart Study at the University of Mississippi Medical Center and the Diabetes Prevention Program at the Broad Institute. \"With the first study, the information was too coarse,\" she explains, noting that genes can have as many as 100 SNPs. \"Now we are trying to discover what is in the neigh- borhood of this SNP that is functional in the increase of diabetes risks.\" The new study aims to discover whether the genetic variants discovered in the MAGIC study with people of European descent affect risk in other ethnic populations, and also to identify the exact genetic variant that increases diabetes risk. \"We don't have all the pieces yet,\" says Dupuis. \"That's why they call diabetes a complex disease. It's not straight-forward. Diet, exercise, and the environment are involved as well.\" R Dupuis and her team evaluated the 22 human chromosomes, depicted here in alternating colors along the graph's x-axis. Peaks in the graph represent increased evidence that genetic variants in that location of the genome influenced fasting glucose levels.

The rain pounded relentlessly as Nathan Hogan made his way across the barren Greenland tundra. His back - pack\u2014heavier in its waterlogged state\u2014sagged on his shoulders, and he wondered, not for the first time, if trek - king 100 miles across the Arctic Circle Trail was such a great idea. A graduate of the Creative Writing Program, Hogan is writing a novel about 19th-century British Royal Navy Cap-tain John Ross, who in 1818 set out on a voyage across the Arctic Ocean in search of the Northwest Passage. By explor-ing the western coast of Greenland himself, Hogan hoped to gain insight into the country's people and customs while witnessing firsthand its majestic icebergs and glaciers. The 100-mile slog between Sisimiut and Kangerlussuaq was an attempt to re-create Ross's expedition. \"I've found that after three or four days of continuous walking,\" Hogan says, \"my feet and mind slip into strange and productive new rhythms, difficult to otherwise replicate. And because my project was in some sense about an altered state\u2014an episte- mological crisis, an imagined obstruction of ice and rock that occurs only after many weeks at sea\u2014it seemed somehow important to enact my protagonist's voyage in miniature.\" Hogan's journey was made possible through the Robert Pinsky Global Fellowships in Creative Writing. The program, established in 2009 through a $2 million dona- tion from Robert J. Hildreth, vice chair of the BU Board of Overseers, provides funds for up to four months of interna-tional study. Named in honor of former U.S. Poet Laureate, translator, and critic Pinsky, a College of Arts & Sciences professor of English, it sent five writers overseas last year. This year, the number of recipients more than doubled, with 12 graduates selected to take part. The opportunity to experience a foreign culture heightens writers' skills by exposing them to lifestyles that challenge their thinking, says Pinsky. \"The fellowships reinforce the demanding nature of the Creative Writing Program,\" he adds. \"The more different the experience, the richer the challenge.\" International highlights headlineIn August, poet Ani Gjika, who left her native home of Albania more than 14 years ago, returned to her birthplace to research five female Albanian poets whose work she plans to translate into English. \"There are only a hand- ful of Albanian women whose poetry has been translated,\" says Gjika, \"and those transla- tions are very literal. They've lost what makes them unique, perhaps because the transla- tors were not familiar with Albanian culture.\" Gjika is nated by poets like Drita Como and Luljeta Lleshanaku. But perhaps the most meaningful part of her project is the study of her own mother's poems. Before moving to the United States, Julia Gjika published two volumes of poetry in her native language, and her daughter vowed to make them available to English readers. \"Poetry is a very young profession for Albanian women,\" Gjika explains. \"They were not published in Alba-nia until the 1970s, and even then, women had to write a certain way, or else they risked being censored.\" In his debut novel, The Strike (2006), Canadian writer Anand Mahadevan tells a coming-of-age story about an Indian boy whose adventures play out against a tumultuous 1980s backdrop. In his forthcoming book, a collection of short stories, he moves the action to Dufferin Grove, an eclectic Toronto neighborhood with a diverse population of Indian, Portu- guese, and Bangladeshi immigrants. Historically, many of Toronto's Portuguese immigrants come from the Azores, a cluster of nine volcanic islands situ-ated off the Portuguese and Moroccan coasts. Consequently, Mahadevan has centered his stories between two house-holds: one Indian and one Azorean. While he can draw from his own family's experi- ence of immigrating to Canada from India, Mahadevan is less comfortable telling the story from the perspective of Azorean immigrants. \"I've never been to the Azores,\" he says. \"My knowledge of the culture is limited, and I don't speak the language. \"From what little interaction I've had with my own Azorean neighbors,\" he continues, \"I know that family is important; bonds are strong, and that poses an interesting question: why do so few ever go home, even for a visit?\" For answers, Mahadevan traveled to the Azores to meet a handful of returnados, Azorean immigrants who returned home after decades spent living abroad. \"A lot of returnados moved to Canada during the 1970s,\" he says. \"I hope to gain insight into what life was like back then, what challenges they faced, and what called them home.\" Dynamic Duo During the 1960s, around the same time that former BU President harold Case began his quest to trans-form Boston University from a commuter school into a leading national research institution, the United king-dom announced a government initiative to expand access to higher education. The University of w ar- wick, widely regarded as one of Britain's top research schools, is probably the most impressive result of that expansion. \"Boston University and Warwick have striking simi- larities,\" says Graham Wilson, a BU professor of political science. \"They're comparable in size, programs of study, and ambition, and both are renowned as dynamic and entrepreneurial institutions.\" So when Britain's then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown proposed more inter-university collaboration between the United Kingdom and the United States, it came as no surprise that Warwick looked to Boston Univer- sity as a potential partner. \"We are very much like-minded institutions, and have both evolved in parallel into major research universi-ties during the past three to four decades,\" says Andrei E. Ruckenstein, vice president and associate provost for research at BU. \"Our similar trajectories and aspirations, many common interests, as well as the common mindset and vision of our faculty and academic leadership make the BU-Warwick partnership unique as a venue for exploring models of global universities.\" To that end, BU and Warwick two years ago announced a partnership to leverage the strengths of each institution through research collaborations in new and emerging disciplines. For the short term, Ruckenstein says, \"We are focusing on research and educational opportuni- ties in areas in which we have complementary strengths, or in impactful directions\u2014new to both institutions\u2014where we are willing w riting alumnus Nathan hogan, above, trav - eled to Greenland in search of inspiration for a historical novel about John Ross, a British sea captain who ventured into the same icy\u2014and then unknown\u2014waters in 1818, in search of the Northwest Passage.Time spent abroad can\u2014and should\u2014 challenge aspiring writers into new modes of thinking, says former Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky. (continued on next page)with a diverse student body on campus, representing more than 135 nations, and well-established study abroad programs in 30 countries on six continents, BU has a strong tradition of global engagement. T oday, that tradition continues with new traveling fellowships, an innovative inter-university collaboration, and forward-looking contributions to the international exchange of ideas. while translating poems by Albanian women writers into English, Ani Gjika visited vithkuq, k \u00f6r\u00e7e County.

For example, BU wants to expand its studies of electron microscopy, an area in which Warwick is strong. \"Instead of building our own center of excellence in elec- tron microscopy, we can use Warwick's,\" Kevin Smith says. \"In exchange, Warwick's faculty members will have access to our materials and projects.\" Earlier this year, Ruckenstein appointed Kevin Smith to lead a steering committee for the project. Other commit-tee members include Adil Najam, a professor of interna- tional relations and director of the BU Frederick S. Pardee Center for the Study of the Longer-Range Future; Alan Cohen, a professor of health policy and management and executive director of the BU Health Policy Institute; and Wilson. So far, the collaboration has been a success. Research- ers in the physics, chemistry, and engineering departments, along with their Warwick counterparts, are currently studying energy materials that are used in storage devices such as solar cells, fuel cells, and batteries. In the political science department, Wilson and his colleagues are study - ing business and government relations. \"It turns out that both universities have tremendous strengths in these areas,\" Wilson says. \"So in December we held a joint research session at Warwick. Our topic was the ways in which the economic crisis of the past three years has changed business and government relations. We hope the resulting papers will become a book.\" Kevin Smith expects the partnership to expand sig- nificantly within the next year. \"We're putting out a call for new proposals,\" he says, \"so we expect to see growth into new areas of joint scholarship.\" The next step is to involve students, both graduates and undergraduates. \"We envision a system where stu-dents will move seamlessly between the two universities,\" Smith says. \"They'll regard both BU and Warwick as their homes.\"Imagining T omorrow T oday Adil Najam takes issue with an old Doris Day hit song. Que sera, sera What ever will be, will be The future's not ours to see Que sera, sera. \"No, the future won't be what it will be,\" he says. \"The future will be what you make of it.\" As director of the Frederick S. Pardee Center for the Study of the Longer-Range Future, Najam has built a career around thinking about the future, but he doesn't do it through reading tea leaves or gazing into crystal balls. \"It's about research,\" he says. \"The future is a big puzzle, and to solve it we must look at every individual piece: politics, economics, technology, culture.\" Established in 2000 by Frederick S. Pardee\u2014who received degrees from the BU School of Management and Graduate School of Management, as well as an honorary doctorate in 2006\u2014the center focuses its research on iden- tifying, anticipating, and enhancing the long-term poten- tial for human progress. In recent years the center has been focusing on regional patterns of human progress. In 2008, an international group of scholars came together to discuss the future of China in terms of politics, religion, law, economics, energy, the environment, and health care. Organized by Joseph Fewsmith, a Pardee Center faculty fellow and professor of international relations and political sciences, the conference included 14 leading experts from the United States, China, and Germany, who presented papers that were later compiled into a book, China Today, China Tomorrow: Domestic Politics, Economy, and Society (2010), edited by Fewsmith. Although the center's research focuses on the long- term\u2014that is, between 35 and 200 years ahead\u201450 appears to be the magic number. \"If I ask our experts to imagine what something will be like in a year, they remain con- strained in the shackles of today,\" Najam says. \"They need a good 50 years\u2014an entire generation\u2014to distance them-selves from the present, to envision a world that is entirely different from what they know.\" This year, the center concentrated on South Asia and Africa. While the South Asia 2060 project focuses on sce-narios that could occur during the next five decades, Najam says, its research is rooted in steps that can be taken now to move toward a more positive future. The center hosted a series of South Asia 2060 seminars, including in South Asia itself, and a collection of resulting essays\u2014each focusing on individual aspects of South Asia's regional futures\u2014will be published as an anthology in 2011. In April, the center hosted another all-day conference, \"The Good News from Africa,\" as part of its Africa 2060 program. With discussions on social development, markets and economy, politics and institutions, and society and culture, the conference also served as a launching pad for a number of papers that examine regional development in Africa, the narcotics trade, obesity in sub-Saharan Africa, malaria, and agricultural and climate change. Although each conference focuses on a different region, Najam has noticed one common trend emerge. \"In every instance,\" he says, \"the solution for the future of these regions includes better governance and institutions. Now we just have to focus on getting there.\" R Similar histories and equally ambitious plans for the future make Boston University and the University of w arwick ideal partners in a growing inter-university collaboration on research and educational opportunities. The Pardee Center's Africa 2060 program is optimistic about the continent's future. here, children take a break from their studies for a game of soccer at St. The-resa's Early Childhood Development Center in Sekondi, Ghana.

Clark, an art history major, realized that the plunder and sale of antiquities\u2014a practice dating at least as far back as the Roman period\u2014remains the modus operandi in today's art world, where it continues to undermine a people's ability to understand and preserve their cultural past. \"I've always been interested in art history, but I had never been exposed to that aspect of it before,\" Clark says. \"That really focused my studies on what I wanted to pursue at BU.\" Toward the end of the semester, she contacted her writing instructor, Christina Luke, who is also a research fellow in the Department of Archaeology, about other opportunities to study looting and its impact on cultural heritage. The exchange sparked Clark's long-term involve-ment in the Central Lydia Archaeological Survey, a project Luke co-directs with Christopher Roosevelt, an associate professor of archaeology. Clark is one of several undergraduates who have been involved in the survey, which explores human activity in western Turkey from the prehistoric age until the present and is partially funded by the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) at BU. Launched in 2005, the survey centers on a 135-square-mile rural area south of Istanbul and east of the Aegean Sea. Luke and Roosevelt initially chose the site because of its proximity to Sardis, the capital of the Iron Age Lydian Empire, and its role as a vast burial ground for Lydian kings. (Known as Bin Tepe, or \"The Thousand Mounds,\" the area is the largest tumulus cemetery in Turkey.) But before long, the proj-ect expanded in scope, from the Bronze Age through today. \"It began with a focus on the Iron Age and on under- standing one of the world's early empires and its hinterland,\" says Roosevelt. \"But it quickly grew into something broader because, as we learned very quickly, the remains of the area date to much more than just the Iron Age. There are much older and also much more recent periods of activity.\" In the second millennium BC, for example, when Mycenaean Greeks ruled the Aegean and Hittites had established themselves in Asia Minor, central Lydia saw the rise of a network of fortifications, which might have served as a buffer zone between the two empires. These Bronze Age structures provide exciting support for the existence of a sophisticated indigenous state and also offer clues about how the land was used by early populations. \"A system like this, with the complexity that we see at these sites, is unknown anywhere else in western Anatolia right now,\" Luke says.academic r esearch at major universities\u2014an exciting world of excavations, sediment sampling, and high-level lab tests\u2014is typically reserved for graduate-level work. b ut at b oston u niversity, a significant number of faculty members are giving undergraduates a key role to play in ongoing research projects\u2014in some cases, as early as freshman year.

Poised to do the bidding of their masters, these zombie computers become part of \"bot-nets\"\u2014networks of thousands, or even mil-lions, of computers that can cause all sorts of trouble, by scanning the i nternet to look for other vulnerable computers; sending out reams of spam email to ensnare other users; revealing keystrokes or online transactions to steal passwords and credit card numbers; or launching distributed denial-of-service ( dd o s) attack s that overload and shut down other websites. These are the types of threats that Mark c rovella and his team of bu computer scien- tists and statisticians spend their days hunt - ing down. Their goal is not to treat your ailing computer, or even to gird your existing secu-rity. i nstead, they aim to identify unwanted i nternet traffic, allowing network providers to stop it from ever reaching your P c . \"For the most part, we tend to leave security to the virus protection programs we buy and install on our P c s,\" says c rovella. These programs typically try to identify mali-cious software by looking for a signature\u2014a sequence of code, or something in the content\u2014and then blocking programs with those signatures. For instance, says c rovella, \"There are programs that can tell a computer to block email with the word ' viagr a' in the title.\" i t can be effective, he says, but only for a little while. \" a n adversary just has to change one letter in its signature\u2014to ' vi@gr a,' for example\u2014and they're attempt define the prop- erties of unwanted traffic, c rovella's strategy is to paint a picture of what \"normal\" i nter- net usage looks like. u sing software he and his team designed, they capture and analyze anonymous traffic information at five-minute intervals as the data flows through thousands of routers around the world. u nusual patterns\u2014statistical anoma- lies in the amount or type of data being transferred\u2014tip off c rovella and his team to potentially malicious activity. h ow these pro- grams sneak into individual computers can change daily, even hourly. b ut their patterns of behavior, the ways they interact on the i nternet, are nearly always outside the norm. dd o s attacks, for instance, generate abnormally large amounts of traffic. con - tent, too, can reveal criminals at work. \" i f you see a large variety of i nternet Protocol, or i P, addresses\u2014numbers that identify indi- vidual computers\u2014coming from one source in a short period of time, that kind of activity is statistically anomalous,\" c rovella explains. a nd \"anything outside of statistically normal traffic patterns is potentially malicious.\" o ther researchers and companies have tried similar techniques, but with only one router at a time. u sing the unique multivari- ate statistical approach developed at bu , says c rovella, \" s uddenly, activity outside the norm stands out in a way it never could if you were looking for it at each source.\" h is technique\u2014based on a method called \"Principal component a nalysis\" and licensed to Guavus, a venture-backed bi-national company led by one of c rovella's former Ph d students a nukool l akina\u2014is now being used by G\u00c9 an T, e urope's main multi-gigabit computer network for research and academic purposes. c rovella continues to refine the tech- nique at bu . e xecuting this type of analysis requires collecting an immense amount of data, and while computers amass and evalu-ate it, c rovella and his team must validate their results themselves before submitting their research for publication. This manual examination of multiple terabytes (a tera-byte is 1,000,000,000,000 bytes\u2014one tril-lion if you lost count of the zeros) not only requires a great deal of time and patience, but also expertise in both computer science and statistics. c rovella typically works with two to three students at a time and one to three other faculty investigators. i t is a small army against a growing enemy: every day, according to symant ec Message l abs, approximately 151 billion unsolicited mes-sages are distributed by compromised computers. \" a year or so ago, i discovered my own P c was infected with a botnet,\" c rovella said, smiling and shaking his head. \"The i T folks discovered it. i never knew it was there.\" rcomput ers sending viruses, spam, and other unwanted malware can be hard for anti-virus pro-grams to detect. b ut they stand out right away in a diagram created by computer scientist Mark c rovella, which illustrates data flow between various i P addresses.

Widespread looting has already destroyed a significant portion of Bin Tepe's burial mounds and is now encroaching on the ring of fortified sites near Turkey's Marmara Lake, including the central citadel at Kaymak\u00e7. To help track what has been looted and to prevent further destruction, Luke and Roosevelt have incorporated a preservation component into the Central Lydia Archaeological Survey. Last year, Ali Clark and Caitlin Curtis, who received her BA in history in 2009 and is now pursuing graduate studies at SUNY Buffalo, combed through decades of auction catalogues at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, documenting artifacts on the art market that might have been looted from Lydia. Their findings were used to con- struct a database of looting activity. The two students are also helping Luke and Roosevelt as they develop a heritage management plan involving community workshops and cooperation with local museum and government officials to design and implement preservation strategies. Two other students involved in UROP\u2014Meg Sneeringer and Olivia Shoucair\u2014have made significant contributions to archaeological research in their time at BU, and Sneeringer has gone on to a fully funded PhD pro- gram in archaeology at the University of Cincinnati. \"One of the things we try to do with our undergradu- ates is expose them to the full range of archaeological work that's important for students to be familiar with if they want to continue in this field,\" Roosevelt says. \"We have them get their feet wet and their hands dirty in all aspects of the project.\" The benefits, he is quick to add, go both ways. \"It's really great to work with interested, diligent, serious undergraduates,\" he says. \"They're new and fresh to the material and the project, with an eagerness and curiosity that carries projects like this through.\" Rock of Ages Diamonds may be a girl's best friend, but garnet is the mineral proving most helpful for a team of budding earth scientists trying to map the Earth's chronology. Using a special method of garnet dating, Associ- ate Professor of Earth Sciences Ethan Baxter and the undergraduates in his lab are gaining insight into tectonic processes\u2014such as mountain building and plate move-ment\u2014that occurred millions of years ago. Garnets are minerals that grow over long periods of time and preserve information about geologic changes through a series of concentric spherical shells, not unlike the growth rings on a tree. One way to determine the age of individual rings is through a method known as samarium-neodymium isotope dating. The labor-intensive approach involves measuring the ratio of decay of a radioactive samarium isotope to a radiogenic neodymium isotope found in the garnet. Samarium and neodymium must be extracted through a meticulous process of chemical cleans-ing; then, specific isotopes are isolated and measured using a thermal ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS). When Julie Barkman decided to pursue an indepen- dent work for distinction in Baxter's lab her senior year, she had no background in the sophisticated chemical procedures that garnet dating requires. Soon, she had not only mastered the procedures, but had begun to seek ways to improve them. \"I gained a really valuable skill set in terms of all the lab skills that I learned,\" says Barkman, who earned her BA in 2007. Her efforts to refine the samarium-neodymium garnet method\u2014which was not yet capable of the precise results Baxter's lab can achieve today\u2014says Barkman, taught her \"a lot about problem-solving and how to be more innova- tive.\" They also helped her win a National Science Founda-tion fellowship to pursue graduate studies. \"I know it was a huge part of why I got the fellowship,\" says Barkman. \"A lot of my reviewers pointed out that it's really great undergrad experience.\" Baxter agrees. Getting students into the lab early is important, he says, because there \"they really get to experience what science is all about. You can be told how science is done, but you don't really learn it until you try to do it yourself.\" Another student, Grace Andrews, started working in the TIMS lab as a freshman. At first she was assigned basic lab tasks like cleaning beakers and organizing materials. By the time she graduated this May, Andrews had completed three directed studies and Web extra Getting between rocks in a small place: Ethan Baxter studies the geological processes affecting the evolution of Earth's crust and mantle. www.bu.edu/research/magazine\u00e7 an independent work for distinction. Her senior thesis investigated the potential causes of pulses of accelerated growth in garnets from the Austrian Alps, a phenomenon first described in detail by Baxter and graduate student Anthony Pollington. \"For a long time, the classic model of tectonics and of mountain building was that these processes operated over a long period of time in a fairly smooth, uniform pace,\" Baxter says. \"Our study provides compelling sup- port for another hypothesis\u2014that slow and steady isn't winning the race in tectonics, but that instead it's brief, rapid spurts or pulses of activity that could be dominat- ing mountain building, metamorphism, and tectonics in general.\" Andrews's work on pulses of accelerated growth has taken her to the Goldschmidt Conference, the world's largest geochemistry gathering, to present her findings on garnets from the Austrian Alps that were collected by Baxter and Pollington. \"I came to BU because I knew I wanted to do research,\" Andrews says. \"I'm doing stuff that's literally never been done before. It's exciting to be fresh out of my bachelor's and at the front lines of scientific research.\" Baxter has mentored a total of 11 undergraduate students so far. \"They're just tremendous,\" he says. \"I have been extremely impressed with the quality and the dedica- tion of our top undergraduates at BU.\" His enthusiasm seems to be contagious. \"Ethan is a great person to learn from,\" says Barkman. \"He wants people to enjoy science and he wants people to be excited about the work that they're doing.\" Do you listen to all the nutrition advice out there? The contradictions, backtracks, and reversals can set your head spinning. A student-built smartphone app shares healthy eating expertise in a couple of clicks. The near-impossibility of getting a straight answer on healthy eating encouraged Larry Istrail, a recent graduate of the College of Health & Rehabilitation Sciences: Sargent College, to help develop an iPhone app that will cut through the bad science and give users a simple, clear idea of their own food intake. PhotoCalorie is a free food journal for Apple's iPhone that calculates a meal's nutritional information and records eating habits. Istrail started work on the app during a summer 2009 research project with Mark Boguski, a research associate at Harvard Medical School. Although nutrition apps are common, Istrail says PhotoCalorie's simplicity gives it a competitive edge. \"For a lot of other apps,\" he says, \"you have to search for each item. It's very tedious, and we wanted to eliminate that.\" Users type a meal in one line (\"poppy seed bagel, cream cheese, iced coffee\") and the app, which College of Engineering alumnus Vince Fusaro helped to program, tallies the meal's nutrition: calories, protein, fat, and carbs. Rival programs lack PhotoCalorie's Google-like search component. The photo aspect is also unique. \"You take a picture of the food as a way of personal- izing your journal,\" says Istrail, who used the U.S. Depart-ment of Agriculture's nutrient database to compile the extensive food list that powers the app. \"A lot of people have told us that they just take the pictures, that's it, and they have a visual food journal.\" Istrail also runs the PhotoCalorie blog, dispensing timely nutritional news and tips and offering a science major's take on the latest dietary trends. His interest in seeking out the truth behind ever-changing healthy eating advice was encouraged in a class on nutritional epidemi- ology taught by Associate Professor of Nutrition Paula Quatromoni. Quatromoni says nutrition is such a hot topic right now that more people are seeing it as a career path. And she says that students need to understand the truth behind these studies because there is so much confusion. \"Any tool that helps people increase their awareness of their personal habits has the potential to shift behaviors,\" she says. \"The average person has difficulty identifying reputable sources of nutrition information and distin- guishing fact from fiction. On the web, in magazines, on TV , and in the aisles of health food stores, it is easy for consum- ers to be misled and fall prey to false hope.\" Istrail is optimistic the app will make it easier to get nutrition facts into the open and help inform some of the millions of people who suffer from nutrition-related health problems. With the app picking up new users every month, Istrail plans to go to medical school and then focus on research full time. \"If you can do a good study that is novel and actually shows something,\" he says, \"you can change the world; you can influence billions of people.\" R Ethan Baxter Larry Istrail From sunny Sifnos, Greece, to chilly vermont, undergraduate and graduate students in Ethan Baxter's lab are venturing wherever garnet samples can be found: (l-r) Julie Barkman, Leah Mehl, Nora Sullivan, and Michelle Jordan.

Just how much carbon a plant will absorb is one question that researchers from the d epartment of Geog- raphy & e nvironment are tackling, thanks to a two-year exploratory grant from the National s cience Foundation and the u . s . Forest s ervice known as u rban Long-T erm resear ch a rea, or u LT ra- e x. \" w hat we're doing is basically a giant carbon footprint analysis of metropolitan b oston,\" says a ssociate Professor Nathan Phillips, one of the leads on the project. e xcept that in addition to measuring c O2 released by humans, Phillips and his team are \"also linking that to a whole other part of b oston that is exchanging carbon as well, and that's the natural systems.\" w hy carbon? Professor s uchi Gopal, another member of the u LT ra team, explains that they \"made carbon the cur-rency because all biological systems live and breathe; carbon is like cash that flows all over the system.\" b ecause carbon dioxide is not regu- lated by the e Pa , few studies have been done so far to characterize the gas in urban, suburban, or rural environments. s o before u LT ra researchers can solve the problem of offsetting carbon emissions, they need to learn more about the sources of carbon, as well as the sinks\u2014natural or artificial systems that absorb the gas\u2014in and around b oston. T o this end, they are using a Picarro sensor installed on the roof of a campus building to take measurements of airborne carbon dioxide levels ten times per second. Last spring, a ssistant Professor Lucy h utyra teamed up with Phillips to take the Picarro on the road. af ter placing it in the trunk of h utyra's car, they drove from b oston to wor cester, taking measurements of the carbon gas levels every five seconds using a sensor protruding through the car's sunroof. Preliminary findings suggest that carbon emissions increase dramati-cally in urban areas, but some of the data they collected was surprising. \" we w ent to places that we thought would be significant sources for carbon,\" says h utyra. \" a nd some of them were what we expected and some of them weren't.\" Phillips is also interested in learning which species of plants are most efficient in carbon uptake. \"The urban environment is like an experimental treatment,\" he says. \" a re plants more or less healthy? a re they growing faster or slower?\" cer tain species of vegetation may hold the key to the carbon question. \"There is data that suggests that some invasive species grow like gangbusters in the urban environ-ment, and that native vegetation doesn't do as well,\" says Phillips. One of the most com-mon invasive species is Ailanthus altissima, an e ast a sian tree that thrives in urban environ- ments all along the e ast coast, leading Phil - lips to wonder, \"If those ailanthus trees were not growing in the parking lot, what would be there? would it be a nic e native red oak tree, or are invasive species occupying niches in the urban environment that might be too degraded for native species to occupy?\" h ardy species of vegetation like the ailanthus may be the answer to increasing the amount of carbon sinks in metropolitan areas like b oston. The more plants that are growing, the more carbon is absorbed. s atellite imagery can show researchers how much vegetation exists in a certain area, but it cannot tell them how much carbon is stored in each plant. a ground-level census of the vegetation in and around b oston\u2014 combined with the data that Picarro has collected about the levels of gasses in the air\u2014could lead bu researchers toward finding ways of offsetting the high levels of carbon found in urban and suburban areas. a nother aspect of u LT ra is study- ing the effects of human behaviors on carbon emissions in b oston. Led by rober t Kaufmann, professor and chair of the d epartment of Geography & e nvironment, this project is focusing on when and why people are using certain appliances and is also tracking commuting habits to see how residents might be nudged in sustainable directions. In 2012, bu researchers will compete for the next level of u LT ra , which would provide funding for a decade. The team is confident that their findings to date will pique interest in future research. \"Once we have the core information, we can start to play what if games,\" says h utyra. \" w hat if we increase the canopy cover? w hat if we required new housing developments to set aside green space? w hat would that mean in terms of the carbon impact? b ut before we can really do that, we have to complete our understanding of where we are today.\" rA Breath of Fresh AirBy Katherine Calver haw Kins Award-Winning Faculty \" T he urban environment is like an experimental treatment. a re plants more or less healthy? a re they growing faster or slower?\" Graduate student Jared Newell, left, and a ssociate Professor of Geography & e nvironment Nathan Phillips are part of a team using the Picarro sensor, seen here, to measure airborne carbon dioxide levels above bu 's s tone s cience b uilding and around b oston.
