Looking back to the process of produ cing this dissertation once I have completed the final product makes me recall all the people who contributed both intellectually and materially. Knowledge production is exceptionally the outcome of one single mind and for the most part could not be comple ted without having the needs of our material life fulfilled. Throughout my graduate life and as a graduate student at UCSF in particular, I was fortunate to receive the mentorship, advice, and support of professors, friends, and family, both in the United States and Mexico. Dorothy Porter accepted to supervise a thesis that I originally conceived about the history of alternative medicine in Mexico but that thanks to her suggestions and ideas turned out to be about the role of the state in the regulation of the medical profession. Gabriela Soto -Laveaga kindly accepted to co -chair my dissertation in spite of residing in a UC different campus. Her advice led me to use other Latin American countries to contrast the Mexican case and her sharp insight clarified a nd improved my ideas about the role of medicine and public health in Mexico in many ways. I started my training as a historian of medicine with Elizabeth Watkins and Brian Dolan. I learned from Elizabeth that the definition of medicine results not only fro m the doctor - patient interaction but also from other actors in society at large. From Brian, I learned the opposite; that keeping the central role of the doctor -patient relationship in mind is central to understand the role of broader social actors in medi cine and health. Both Elizabeth's and Brian's editing skills contributed deeply to improve my English writing in the final manuscript. However as customary, the ideas contained in the final manuscript are my full responsibility. v In the process of research and writing, I enjoyed the benefit of crossing paths with several scholars and students who also influenced my work. I want to thank Heather Dron, Kevin Moss, Erika Langer, and Stephen Beitler, for reading and commenting several drafts of my dissertation in the History of Medicine Writing Club during 2013 -14. I want to thank the Program of the History of Health Sciences at UCSF for providing the opportunity to share preliminary research and receive feedback during the Biennial History Day in 2009 and 2011. Gabriela's invitation to participate in the Workshop on the History of Public Health in Latin America and the Caribbean held at the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2011 and 2012 gave me the opportunity to meet other scholars and students engagi ng in topics similar to my own. I want to thank Nicole Pacino in particular. She has been a role model to me, both as an advanced graduate student and later as a young professor. Hanni Halil and \u00c1ngel Rodr\u00edguez participated in both workshops and provided i nsightful comments to first drafts of some of the chapters. My former graduate mentors in Mexico opened spaces both material and academic to do research and discuss my work. Fabricio Gonz\u00e1lez Soriano invited me to a seminar on the historiography of alterna tive medicine in Mexico held at Universidad del Papaloapan , campus Tuxtepec , in 2010 and a research assistantship at CINVESTAV , sede sur , in 2011. Carlos L\u00f3pez Beltr\u00e1n ceded one of his classes to discuss my dissertation project with his students at UNAM in 2011. Ana Mar\u00eda Carrillo and Paul Hersch Mart\u00ednez kindly accepted to discuss my ideas for a doctoral dissertation during the summer of 2011. Homeopaths Fernando Dom\u00ednguez Vello, Fernando Francois Flores, Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez, and Pedro Fernando Infante Le onides introduced me to the world of homeopathy and its institutions in Mexico. Pursuing doctoral studies abroad and about my own country posed si gnificant material challenges to me and my family. We couldn't have sorted them out without the help of many vi friends in both sides of the border. I want to thank Susana and Armando, Matthew and Carmen, Malu and Francisco, Ana and Alejandro, Alejandra and A aron, Ros\u00e1ngela and Rafael, Amanda and Evan, Erica and Selena, Laura and Jos\u00e9, and Juan Carlos and Ana, who one way or another supported us in good and harsh times and made us feel the Bay Area like home. The long and stormy summers in Mexico City felt now alien to us, but family offered a place to stay comfortably dry and emotionally sheltered. Special thanks go to my grandmother, Do\u00f1a Luz, t\u00eda Luvy, and t\u00edo Juan, who gave us plenty of room to stay and food to eat during the summers of 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Norma and Tey always opened their homes and kitchens for us. I could not have finished the doctorate and the doctoral dissertation without the emotional support from my family. My father and mother were always there to listen to me when I went through difficult times. My father always had words of support that encouraged me to continue. With their ability to distinguish and show different perspectives in life, my mother calmed my anxieties. Most of all, I want to thank my partner in life, friend, an d wife, Liliana. She did all the actual hard work at home, kept me well fed, nourished my dreams, shared my frustrations, gave me joy in times of distress, and persistently showed to me that there is a life beyond academia. Several institutions provided t he financial support to pursue my doctoral studies and carry out archival research in Mexico. I want to thank the Mexican government and the University of California which through their coordinated CONACYT -UCMEXUS fellowship funded my doctoral studies. Sev eral programs provided the funds for my monthly stipend: the CONACYT - UCMEXUS fellowship, UCSF's Department of Anthropology, History and Social Medicine, and UCSF's Biomedical Workforce Fellowship. I received support from the UCSF Travel Grant, the UC Gradu ate Student Research Award, and the UCMEXUS Small Grant for UC Students to carry out archival research. vii Abstract In my doctoral dissertation, I analyze homeopathy as a subaltern medical movement that both participated in and reacted to the cultural reforms and institutional regulations that characterized Mexico during the Porfiriato and the post -revolutionary period s. In a context where medical elites used science to consolidate their position amidst state institutions, homeopaths evolved into a grou p of professional physicians and lay practitioners who held an unorthodox view of medical science and whose institutions diverted the state's political and economic support. My analysis shows that professional societies, medical schools, and public health offices worked as an interconnected structure of regulatory centers. Here, homeopaths, regular medical practitioners, and state authorities used their understandings of science, education, and class to advance their position s in the professional arena, org anize and administer medical institutions, and centralize political control. I argue that by using homeopathy as a scientific therapeutic method distinct from contemporary medical science and as a professional ideology that critiqued elitist medical traini ng and practice , homeopaths aligned with the Mexican state 's cultural and institutional reforms that aimed to provide scientific medical training to the working class. In this way, they resisted the marginalizing strategies implemented by medical elites' p rofessional societies , professional education , and public health authorities. The professionalization of homeopathy, hence, reproduced in a smaller scale the tensions between lay and scientific knowledge, professional libertarianism and regulation, and the working and the privileged class es that characterized Mexico before and after the revolution of 1910. My dissertation thus investigates the influence of local social, cultural, and political realities in the construction of the boundaries between biomedic ine and other healing traditions in modern Mexico. My work is based on extensive research in private and public archives of homeopathic medical schools, and government offices such as the Department of Public Health, the National University, the viii General Ar chives of the Nation, and the Historical Archives of Mexico City, as well as published homeopathic journals. This dissertation contributes to the history of medicine and public health in Mexico and in Latin America, the history of the medical profession, t he history of alternative medicine, and the history of the Mexican revolution. ix Table of contents Acknowledgements iv Abstract vii Introduction: What is Revolutionary in the History of Mexican Homeopathy? 1 Revolutionary Medicine 6 Historiographical relevance 13 Chapter Structure 19 Chapter 1: Med icine \"for the Mexican People\": Liberal Medicine, the Medical Marketplace, and Domestic Homeopathy in Mexico, 1853 -1901 25 Ram\u00f3n Co mellas and the Promotion of Homeopathy as a Liberal Form of Medicine 26 Homeopathy as a Medical Commodity: Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, Domestic Medicine and the Mexican Medical Marketplace 35 Francisco I.

Figure 1. \"In 1935, fanaticism and prejudice still exist [in Mexico], in spite of the Constitution's reformed article 3rd and 20th -century scientific positivism\". Back cover of the (Octubre, 1935). See main text for explanation . 2 On October 1935, the journal of Mexico City's Union of Medical Doctors, Acci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica , published a special issue aimed to attack what they called \"the charlatanistic homeopathic manifestations\". The back cover depicted a congress of homeopaths using symbols and representations that pictured homeopathy as a \"fanatic and prejudiced\" approach to medicine that opposed modern scientific progress (Figure 1) . The owl of wisdo m mocked at the law that had created a state -funded school of homeopathy in 1895 . A poster above the speaker ridiculed homeopathic medicines by highlighting that the homeopathic pharmaceutical company, \"Sugar, Inc.\", promised to heal diseases, such as \"sca bies, dysentery, syphilis, malaria, and tape worm\" . The irony in this comment lay in physicians' generalized acknowledgment that these diseases were caused by microorganisms and that they could be only either prevented through sanitary interventions or vac cination or treated with recently developed pharmaceutical products that actually proved effective such as Salvarsan for syphilis, but not with homeopathic sugar globules, which contrary to what homeopaths argued other physicians believed did not contain any trace of therapeutic substance . The homeopath's speech in the back cover's picture repeated the union's criti ques to homeopathic practice, \"there are no microbes. We stop epidemic outbreaks. Serums do not work. Vaccines do harm\". The text -box in the bot tom explained that by selling remedies that contained only sugar and water, homeopaths highly profited from their practice, concluding in a satirical tone that homeopaths still argued that they helped the poor.1 In this representation of homeopathy, the c onflicting notions of disease and therapeutic intervention between homeopaths and allopaths were intertwined with university physicians' ideas of what should be science's and the state's role in medical training and the provision of medical services. Accor ding to the reasoning of the graduates from the National School of 1 \"N\u00famero especial dedicado a las manifestaciones charlatanesco -homeop\u00e1ticas,\" Acci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica .14 (1935). 3 Medicine, the state should use medical science to train physicians who based on reliable methods that uncovered the true nature of disease would be able to bring health to all the Mexican population. The tensions between homeopaths and university trained physicians were not new. Since the arrival of the first Spanish homeopathic practitioners to Mexican shores in the mid -19th century, medical elites used contemporary medical science to discr edit homeopathy, homeopaths' medical practice, and professional organization, in academically -trained physicians' quest to monopolize state support and the medical marketplace. As during the Porfiriato (the thirty -year-long period when Porfirio Diaz ruled the country, 1884 -1911), science was used as a tool not only to modernize state institutions but to redeem the masses after the armed conflicts of the 1910s. For instance, in a talk given to the Nationa l Academy of Sciences \"Antonio Alzate\" in 1937, Alfonso Pruneda, an elite physician who occupied key government positions from which he promoted the reconstruction of institutions of the revolutionary state in the 1920s, the social function of science , which according to him consisted in allow ing the humanity to live an easy and pleasant life , could not be entirely achieved if the rupture between science and the masses was not mended and if university students and faculty did not get closer to the people.2 In other words, for Pruneda, Mexico could not achieve the desired progress unless science became part of Mexican culture, that is, until all of Mexican society integrated science as an integral part of its ways of understanding the natural and the social w orld. However, this redeeming view of science, progressive as it may seem, carried the seeds of exclusionary social, cultural, and political mobilizations, such as the one depicted in the introductory vignette. Being a physician, Alfonso Pruneda himself u sed science to discredit other forms of healing approaches. In a conference given to the Sociedad Folkl\u00f3rica de M\u00e9xico 2 Alfonso Pruneda, \"La funci\u00f3n social in 1942, Pruneda explained the nature of charlatanism and detailed the practices of charlatans in Mexico.3 According to him, a charlatan was someone who abused others because that person knew that it was possible to take advantage of their ignorance and na\u00efvet\u00e9. He did not mentioned homeopaths among Mexican charlatans, but his description mirrored those given b y the Mexico City's Union of Medical Doctors in the special issue dedicated to homeopathy. This was no coincidence. Medical students were being trained in contemporary science in the National School of Medicine at the National University of Mexico during t he 1920s. With promoters of science such as Fernando Ocaranza who led the former, and Alfonso Pruneda who led the latter, the medical school reproduced Pruneda's critiques of other approaches to medicine that differed from those supported by contemporary m edical science. For instance, Miguel Cece\u00f1a Quiroz, who studied medicine at the National School in the mid -1920s and later practiced homeopathy, said that if one professor talked about [homeopathy] \u2014 may be because it became a fashion when we [students wh o were formerly studying homeopathy at the state \u2014 sponsored homeopathic medical school that was merged to the National School of Medicine in 1924] came - it was to attribute to [homeopathy] any wisecrack [ cuchufleta ] that revealed [the professor's] lack of knowledge about the issue. [...] One of the professors, full of pride and vanity, said 'homeopaths put in a container a large number of white and inert globules, as they say, and then it is enough for them to lean out into the container and scream \u2014 for ins tance \u2014 Argentum nitricum in the 30th dilution, with which the globules are baptized'.4 It is no surprise that most physicians who studied at the National University contended that homeopathy and similar practices were useless, regardless of their wide a cceptance by the public. This public was frequently described as the people or the masses, as in Pruneda's works. However, homeopaths proselytized that their approach was beneficial to a specific group of 3 Alfonso Pruneda, \"La supercher\u00eda m\u00e9dica Revista homeop\u00e1tica I.1 (1936). 5 people, not all the people, and particularly not e lites, as it used to happen during the Porfiriato . Homeopathic physicians, homeopathic lay practitioners, patients, and any who defended homeopathy in social terms after 1910 argued that homeopathy was particularly suitable for the poor, the disenfranchise d, and the working class. For this reason, Mar\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez de Origel, a homeopathic practitioner in Guadalajara, said that homeopathy was \"truly revolutionary\". By protecting these particular groups of people, she argued, homeopathy \"prepared the healthy future of the Republic; because when healing the Mexican people, it made men suitable to contribute to the glory of the revolution; at the same time, [homeopathy] protected nationalism in the sense that it prevented the high influx of patent medicines coming from foreign countries at a high cost for the national treasure [...]\". For this reason, she concluded, \"Homeopathic Science is truly revolutionary and must not be discharged\", referring to the campaign led by university physicians against homeopaths.5 The progressive science pictured by Pruneda was the same as that which prevented the progress of the nation, in the opinion of homeopathy supporters. The need to bring science to the masses in Pruneda's talk indicated the limitations of the National Universit y to bring education to the Mexican population in general and to popularize scientific knowledge in particular. As exemplified in Querido Moheno's letter to request that graduates from a proprietary homeopathic medical school received licenses to practice medicine from the Department of Public Health, the use of science as a tool of progress, which was reflected in the structural changes carried out by government authorities, seemed to contradict the revolutionary values that motivated these changes in the first place. In other words, the revolutionary policies and government structures that used science as the foundational ideology of progress privileged Mexican social elites and 5 See correspondence from Mar\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez de Origel to the head of the Depart ment of Public Health on February 28, 1934, in the AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 5, pp. 76 -8. 6 while in principle aimed to bring modernity to the masses, in practice they le ft out of the equation of progress those for whom the revolution was fought. Moheno argued that in the Department of Public Health was established a mafia of allopaths, who had been working against homeopaths due to envy and competition. Since those revol utionaries who governed boasted their being protagonists of progress \u2014 he argued \u2014 the Department of Public Health, being integrated by revolutionaries , should not prevent the practice of homeopathic medicine because this had even more scientific foundations than allopathy.6 Homeopaths and their supporters contended, hence, that medical science and those who supported it were not revolutionary. This contention begs the question, what was there in homeopathy that made it revolutionary as opposed t o biomedicine in the 1920s and 30s in Mexico? What does Mexican homeopaths' activism tell us about the position of medical science and the medical profession in Mexico from the last half of the 19th century to the first decades of the 20th century? What do es homeopathy as revolutionary medicine tell us about its relevance as a historical subject in Mexican history? Revolutionary Medicine My dissertation uses homeopathy as a lens to understand the changes that the Mexican medical profession went through i n the period from the publication of the first homeopathic manuals in the mid -19th century to the recognition of homeopathic medical doctors as regular practitioners in the law of professions issued in 1943. During this century homeopathy not only gained a place among the therapies consumed and administered by urban Mexican patients, but also and perhaps most importantly, obtained the support of the Mexican state as a medical option suitable to the national population. Whether as a \"medical reform\" promoted by elites during the 19th century or as \"revolutionary medicine\" pushed by the working class during the 1920s and 6 Querido Moheno's request for the revision of the case between the Department of Public Health and homeopaths graduated from the Free School of Homeopathic Medicine, on Apr il 14, 1923, AHSS, SP, EM, 4, 15, pp. 64 -66. Emphasis in the original . 7 30s, homeopathic practitioners were able to convince contrastingly different sectors of the Mexican population as well as officers with radic ally different political ideologies and government strategies of the usefulness of their peculiar therapeutic approach to the Mexican population. As I argue in the first two chapters of this dissertation, homeopathy was a medicine of elites during the 19th century. Only literate citizens who had access either to literature that came from Europe or to books, pamphlets and newspapers published by nationals were able to read about homeopathy and practice it. Illiterate citizens had access, if any, only through the charitable homeopathic practice of these literate elites. Consequently, homeopathy's institutionalization just before the turn of the 20th century was a result of the mobilization of homeopathic elites in a government that privileged elites. In this s ense, the \"medical reform\" was less an epistemological overturn to medical knowledge than a political one. Members of the national medical profession acknowledged that homeopathy divided national medical science, actually meaning the profession, by receivi ng state support and diverting resources that otherwise would have been allocated to the regular profession. The revolution initiated in 1910 transformed Mexican society and initiated a series of structural changes that slowly materialized in state instit utions through the 1920s and 30s. In this period homeopathic institutions were at the same time eclipsed and reivindicated by government officers. On one side, Porfirian cient\u00edficos such as Pruneda and Ocaranza based their exclusionary policies on a monolithic understanding of medical science, leading to the clousure of homeopathic medical schools and the marginalization of homeopathic practitioners. On the other, educational reformer s such as Jose Vasconcelos (Dean of the National University and Ministry of Public Education, 1920 -4) and government officers concerned with the provision of education to non elites, i.e., the working class and the urban and rural poor, such as President 8 Emilio Portes Gil (1920 -30) and L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas (1934 -8) restructured state educational institutions to include homeopathic schools and regulate homeopathic practice. There was no shift from \"medical reform\" to \"revolutionary medicine\", in the sense that th e revolution did not change the ideology of elite homeopaths who were trained at Porfirian homeopathic institutions. Rather, the revolution set the conditions for the organization of urban non elites around homeopathy as an ideology through which they coul d actively protest against the privileges of medical elites. Homeopathy as a marginal and marginalized urban medical system gave voice to the larger complaints of the working class but in the realm of medicine. Revolution and revolutionary are word s heavi ly loaded with multiple meanings. These meanings are regularly associated with drastic changes that lead to progress. For instance, the revolutions of independence in Latin America in the early 19th century that detached this region of the globe from colon ial, mostly Spanish, political, economic, social, and cultural rule, and the revolutions in the 20th century that aimed to overturn the privileges that independent Latin American nation states perpetuated in the 19th century are but an example of how this word refers to radical changes in social, political, economic, and cultural structures. Intellectual histories in general and histories of science and medicine in particular have used the word to refer to dramatic changes in the understanding of the natura l world or notions of disease. Perhaps the most iconic example in the history of science is the term Scientific Revolution which refers to drastic changes that occurred in the early modern period and initiated a new way of understanding the natural world.7 While historians of medicine are less prone to talk about 7 See for instance works such as P. M. Harman, The Scientific Revolution , Lancaster pamphlets (London ; New York: Methuen, 1983). ; I. Bernard Cohen, The Birth of a New Physics , Rev. and updated. ed. (New York: W.W. Norton, 1985). ; Alexandre Koyr\u00e9, From the Closed World to the Infinite Universe , The library of religion and culture: History, 1st Harper Torchbook ed. (New York,: Harper, 1958). ; and David C. Lindberg, \"Conceptions of the Scientific Revolution from Bacon to Butterfield: A preliminary sketch,\" Reappraisals of the Scientific Revolution , eds. David C. Lindberg and Robert S. Westman (Cambridge 9 radical changes in revolutionary terms, the term has not escaped some major medical breakthroughs particularly those associated with the rise of biomedicine at the end of the 19th century.8 My use of the term \"revolutionary medicine\" does not imply any assumption that homeopathy as a medical system or as a therapeutic commodity represented or represents a radical therapeutic innovation or a breakthrough in the understanding of disease and the body, although homeopaths used both this term and \"the medical reform\" in this sense. Rather, what I mean is that the Mexican state's adoption of homeopathy as one of the forms through which it provides medical training and healing services to the Mexican popul ation raises questions about the place of science in the configuration of the national medical profession and the stratification of Mexican society; the role of the state in defining such a configuration with the aim to fulfill the social promises of the r evolution; and the usefulness of categories that divide medicine into the dichotomies of scientific/regular/orthodox/mainstream and alternative/irregular/unorthodox/marginalized to study the history of medicine in Mexico. In other words, Mexican homeopathy is revolutionary because it highlights the power of medical science as a tool to reform and modernize the medical profession, including both elite and working class homeopaths; because by reconfiguring the understandings of medical science it was able to obtain, lose, retain, and regain state support in the 19th century and throughout the 20th century; because it gave voice to a particular group of practitioners whose critiques of medical elites' policies to regulate medical training and practice opened up the contradictions of England ; New York: Cambridge University Press, 1990). For an analysis that questions this narrative see Steven Shapin, The Scientific Revolution (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1996). 8 As an example see Morris J. Vogel and Charles E. Rosenberg, The Therapeutic Revolution: Essays in the Social History of American Medicine (Phil adelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1979). ; and Andrew Cunningham and Perry Williams, The Laboratory Revolution in Medicine (Cambridge ; New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 1992). 10 top-down regulatory policies; because using it as an ideology, its practitioners organized a professional group and created medical schools and clinics that the revolutionary state used to negotiate the growing political power of med ical elites; and finally because it pushes us to reconceptualize the historiography of Mexican medicine. As this list suggests, this dissertation centers its analysis of homeopathy on the negotiations of scientific knowledge in the configuration of the me dical profession and the creation of state institutions, on the educational policies that aimed to homogenize professional medical training through one single medical curriculum, on the use of a unique approach to medical training as the measure to regulat e professional medical practice, and finally on the limits of such regulatory policies. As in the rest of the Western world, science played a key role in the consolidation of the Mexican state as well as of the Mexican medical profession through the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. Both Porfirian elites and their ideological descendants after the revolution used science to implement policies that aimed to modernize a society that these cient\u00edficos regarded as backward. Consequently, science as a modernizing ideology that motivated educational reforms after the revolution perpetuated class distinctions established since the Porfiriato . Educational reforms in these two historical periods aimed to mode rnize the curriculum of medical schools to incorporate recent advances in medical science and to equip them with the instrumentation they needed to implement such curriculum, but medical training was not opened to the masses, as Pruneda's speech suggests. However if Mexican officials used science to direct the construction of government institutions, Mexican liberalism emphasized that knowledge was not the privilege of some and that any literate citizen was free to acquire, profess, and practice the knowled ge \u2014 or ciencia as it was usually referred by liberals \u2014 he or she wanted. Being a European therapeutic commodity practiced by elites, 11 homeopathy penetrated the minds of some professional physicians as a new scientific breakthrough, but most importantly of some non -professional literate citizens who set it to work for the benefit of others both as a private effort to relieve the latter of disease in the absence of physicians or as a lucrative business that sold homeopathy as a proprietary remedy. Economic liberalism, which favored individual enterprise and free market, conflicted with professional monopoly. In this scenario, medical elites used their own understanding of medical science to discredit homeopathy as a type of knowledge that fooled na\u00efve people, as a knowledge that was popular but not scientific. This distinction between specialized or scientific and popular medical knowledge permeated discussions between homeopaths and medical elites and dictated, once the latter were installed in regulatory pos itions in the new revolutionary state, the policies to marginalize homeopaths. Second, since science played a key role in the modernization of Mexico and the consolidation of the Mexican medical profession, medical elites in key government positions incor porated this key ideology in educational institutions regulated by the state. Government officials hoped to transform Mexican society by indoctrinating them in positivistic science. However, only urban elites who lived in Mexico City benefited from this pr oject. They learned Auguste Comte's epistemological approach to understand the natural and the social world in the National Preparatory School after which they embarked on a professional career. The projects for educational reform during the Porfiriato , which included homeopathy, were halted by the armed conflicts of the revolution, but once an established form of government was achieved in 1917, the Porfirian elites that were implementing such reforms resumed the project to modernize Mexico through educati on. However, the new position of medical elites within the government administration, the poor economic situation of the revolutionary government, and the need to 12 maximize economic resources in an increasingly more expensive medical school led the state to stop supporting homeopathy. In this context, only private homeopathic medical schools sustained by working class students helped homeopathy thrive as an option of medical training for those citizens who could neither afford nor attend the classes in the s tate medical school. Yet the regulatory efforts of the revolutionary state followed the same trends of the Porfiriato and eventually regulated these schools by requiring them to comply with a specific medical curriculum. Third, this dissertation analyzes t he control of medical practice as a sanitary strategy. Medical elites took control of the new Department of Public Health and regarding the free practice of medicine as a plague that needed to be combated accordingly used the resources of the sanitary offi ce to ban the practice of those who had not studied in authorized medical schools. I contend that through controlling the National University, the National School of Medicine, and the Department of Public Health, medical elites mounted a campaign to margin alize the practice of their main competitor, homeopaths. The analysis of changes in the medical curriculum of homeopathic schools as well as the sanitary campaigns to ban the practice of these schools' graduates show that medical elites' purpose to moderni ze the medical profession through science contradicted the need to provide medical training to the working class. Medical elites' policies were designed to keep the privilege of becoming professional physicians to a few who usually belonged to economic and social elites and to ban the possibility of professional medical training and the social mobility that these implied to the working class. In this sense, I argue that the modernizing efforts of the medical elites clashed with the state's effort to dissolv e the acute social stratification inherited from the Porfiriato . 13 Finally, facing the unwillingness of the regular medical profession to respond to the state's social projects, revolutionary governments gave their support back to homeopathy in the late 1920 s and during the 1930s. This support overturned the policies implemented by medical elites, for homeopathic medical schools, both private and public, became regular institutions and its graduates regular practitioners. However, neither medical elites' nor the state's policies completely banned or allowed the practice of homeopaths, respectively. The lack of a clear regulatory framework of professional practice at the federal level and in each local state before 1943 allowed homeopaths who lacked either a de gree or a license to practice in the nation. Moreover, regulatory inconsistency in the rapidly changing legal framework during the 1920s and 30s allowed different homeopathic medical schools to exist regardless of the state's effort to centralize and simpl ify professional education in the second half of the 1930s. I maintain that the conflicting negotiations between different understandings of science, their implementation as educational policies that resulted either in the perpetuation of class distinction or in an effort to disrupt these distinctions, and the contradictory regulatory policies of the state resulted in a medical landscape where a plurality of services prevailed and where homeopathy was vindicated as medicine for the working class, \"revolutio nary medicine\". Historiographical relevance This dissertation emerges at the intersection of three fields of historical inquiry, the history of alternative medicine, the history of public health, and the history of the Mexican revolution. Mexican homeopathy, as conspicuous in the national medical ma rketplace during the previous two centuries as this introduction might suggest, has not been incorporated into national histories of medicine or anthropological studies of medicine in the region until the last couple of decades. Besides anthropologists and historians, homeopaths have chronicl ed their own historical 14 trajectories .9 The work of anthropologists shows that the widespread presence of homeopathy persists to the present and that its practitioners have a diverse academic and economic background: hea ds of family, other professionals who find in homeopathy an extra income, pharmacy owners or employees, allopathically trained doctors and even specialists who study homeopathy as another specialty in their quest to broaden their professional horizons.10 Historians have centered their attention in homeopaths' oppositional and combative role against mainstream elite physicians during the 19th century in Mexico City. While acknowledging the diversity of ideological positions amongst homeopaths regarding the nature of homeopathy and its oppositions to the principles of medical science, or what homeopaths called allopathy, Ana Mar\u00eda Carrillo depicts them as a group that disqualified mainstream medicine and combated against the practices that derived from it.11 My analysis extends the understanding of Mexican homeopathy during the 19th century by acknowledging its role as domestic medicine and a pharmaceutical commodity in the Mexican medical marketplace of this period. The key role that 9 These chronicles are very useful to the historian because th ey illuminate possible routes to follow in the process of research.

By extending my ana lysis to the first half of the 20th century, my dissertation places homeopaths as key actors in the development of medical institutions and sanitary regulations during the 1920s and 30s. Historians of the medical profession in Mexico have emphasized the i mportance of irregular healers, homeopaths among them, in the provision of health services to the population and as competitors of mainstream medicine during the colonial period and the 19th century, but none of them have used the term alternative to descr ibe such practices.12 In contrast, Historians who describe the medical profession of Costa Rica and Colombia during the 19th and 20th centuries picture a landscape where medical pluralism is the norm.13 Historians of medicine in the U. S. consider medical pr actices such as hydropathy, homeopathy, osteopathy, and Christian Science, alternative, as a consequence of the hegemonic control that the mainstream medical profession achieved over these competitors during the first half of the 20th century.14 However, 12 See Luz Maria Hern\u00e1ndez Saenz, Learning to Heal.

The historiography of homeopathy assumes that this particular group of practitioners whether professional or lay were regulated by efforts within the medical profession to monopolize medical training and the provisio n of health services in the absence of any external regulator, such as the state. For this reason some political scientists and sociologists have regarded the professionalization of American physicians as an exemplary case of how liberal professions organi ze.17 The presence of the state as regulator of professional organizations and as arbiter of professional disputes changes significatively the structure of the medical profession. For instance, social scientists Gustavo Nigenda and Sol\u00f3rzano argue that the corporativistic politics of the Mexican state in the 20th century resulted in a dispersed, and I would say plural, medical profession.18 Along the same line of reasoning, public health academic and former Minister of Public Health (2000 -6) Julio Frenk argues that the interventionist state regulated the profession through training and the provision of labor.19 By responding to the demands of different medical groups as an approach to maintain its political control, the Mexican state fragmented the medical profession and did not allow the concentration of power in a single privileged group. My dissertation historicizes this process by centerin g its attention in the most conspicuous competitor of the medical profession, homeopaths. Through this lens, it shows up that state intervention was not monolithic. Changing state policies and contradictory interests of 17 Peter S.

The recent historiography of medicine and public health in Latin America analyzes public health interventions to understand how th e state coped with disease in the nation -building process. These histories have described epidemic disease as the motivation to implement sanitary measures led by mainstream physicians and public health officers that imposed social, cultural, and economic values associated with modernity to populations usually regarded as racially inferior, filthy, and ignorant by public health authorities.20 My dissertation contributes to this 20 There are a wide number of examples of this approach.

By regarding the liberal practice of medicine as a plague that needed to be combated, sanitary authorities embarked on a campaign to sanitize the profession and get rid of practitioner s who lacked adequate medical training. As other works on the role of public health in containing disease show, my work evidences the contradictions of these sanitary campaigns and unmasks the real problem behind the regulation of medical practice: the lac k of physicians who tended to the health needs of the Mexican population and the lack of access among the working class to professional medical training. Analysis of the civilizing and modernizing efforts of the campaigns to sanitize the medical profession reveals the anxieties of Mexican physicians to retain control of their profession. Chapter Structure My dissertation traces the development of homeopathy from a domestic therapeutic commodity in the mid -19th century into a regulated profession at the end of the 1930s. It is divided in six chapters. Chapter 1 analyzes the popularization of homeopathy as domestic medicine and as a therapeutic commodity by entrepreneurial pharmacists and physicians in the context of 19th-century Mexican liberalism. It also e xplores how literate elites used homeopathy to their own domestic purposes through the case study of Francisco I. Madero. This chapter aims to understand how homeopathy was unconventional in the context of Mexican medicine during the 19th century and how M exican people appropriated , promoted , and used the new therapeutic approach . Homeopathy arrived in Mexico when physicians were incorporating French positivism into the national educational system and the French clinical methodology into medical schools. The search for the anatomical cause of disease competed with homeopathy's symptomatic approach, but in the context of political liberalism which emphasized individual rights, a 20 symptomatic approach was closer to the personal experience of individuals who did not have technical training in medicine. Therefore the chapter contends that homeopathy was popularized in Mexican society because it fit the liberal ethos of the time, turning itself into the \"medicine for the people\". Chapter 2 problematizes domestic h omeopathy by analyzing the adoption of homeopathy by university trained physicians and their efforts to turn it into a mainstream medical practice in the last quarter during the Porfiriato . During this period, the homeopathic community divided into two gro ups. Homeopathic elitist physicians supported the monopolizing efforts of the regular profession, while other homeopathic practitioners including lay and professionally trained homeopaths endorsed a liberal approach to medical training and practice. In thi s chapter, I explain the efforts of homeopathic physicians to introduce this therapeutic approach into the dynamics of medical professionalization in Mexico City. Such introduction meant that in order to cope with medical regulations and professional unifying tendencies, homeopathic physicians had to acknowledge the authority of the National School of Medicine and the Superior Board of Health in matters of medical training and licensing. Furthermore, these physicians adopted the rhetoric of positivistic science to position homeopathy as a scientific therapy over other therapies. Consequently , homeopathi c physicians regarded entrepreneurial approaches to and the liberal practice of homeopathy described in Chapter 1 as unprofessional, and separated their activities and institutions from homeopathic practitioners who endorsed them. Eventually, the division of the homeopathic community paid off in terms of professional recognition. A government that sought to modernize the nation through education and science such as that of Porfirio D\u00edaz saw the opportunity to train a growing population of irregular homeopat hic practitioners with dubious medical training and professional credentials in modern scientific 21 homeopathic therapeutics , using properly trained homeopathic physicians in a homeopathic hospital and a school funded by the federal state. A \"medical reform\" turned the \"medicine for the people\" into a medical profession at the end of the 19th century . Chapter 3 explores the role of the state's educational politics and homeopaths' political activism after the revolution in the development of both private and p ublic homeopathic medical schools. The way different homeopathic groups used the rhetoric of educating the working class intertwined with the state 's educational and administrative policies and the interests of the larger medical and the local homeopathic community. Addressing medical training and healing services for the working class granted homeopaths support from both the people and the state throughout the 20th century, in spite of National -School -of-Medicine (ENM) graduates' general opposition. In ins titutional terms, this rhetoric helped them to receive Porfirio D\u00edaz's support to open a National Homeopathic Hospital (HNH) and the National School of Homeopathic Medicine (ENMH ) in 1893 and 1895 , respectively the Escuela Libre de Homeopat\u00eda de M\u00e9xico [Free School of Homeopathy of Mexico, ELHM] to attract students and become the largest homeopathic medical school in Mexico in the 1920s and 30s; and it also helped to reinstall the ENMH as a state medical school during the C\u00e1rdenas administration after the National University disintegrated it in 1925. The homeopathic medical system and professional schools thrived in the first half of the 20th century due to homeopaths' ability to align their training institutions with different governments' populi st policies that aimed to bring professional education to the working class . However, this alignment came at a cost for homeopathic medical schools needed to adopt the scientific medical curriculum imposed by the ENM. In chapter 4, I pay attention to the negotiations between authorities of the D epartment of Public Health (DSP) and first the National University of Mexico ( UNM ), and later the Ministry 22 of Public Education [ Secretar\u00eda de Educaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica , SEP] to achieve a coherent regulation to control medic al practice. Particularly, I emphasize the central role that sanitary authorit ies played in this process. The UNM did not want to assume the role of a state institution that pr escribed professional training, particularly at free schools, and in the late 19 20s lost its place as a state institution that could potentially regulate professional training, at least locally in Mexico City. Facing such lack of first willingness and later authority, the DSP promoted reforms and enforcement of the Sanitary Code, aimi ng to cope with practitioners who lacked irregular medical degrees. I argue that the drive to control medical practice came from the DSP's new position in the government structure initiated in 1917, where it had the authority to rule on health matters all over the nation. I also argue that sanitary authorities aimed to sanitize the profession at the national level assuming that the demograph ics of professional physicians in the countryside reflected th ose of Mexico City. Chapter 5 analyzes the forms of res istance of homeopaths since their arrival in Mexico in the mid -19th century to the year 1930, when President Emilio Portes Gil (1928 -30) issued a decree that made the ELHM a legal institution. The purpose is to show that homeopaths' resistance provides a w ay to measure the limits of professional regulation. Homeopaths ' nature as both regular and irregular practitioners and their struggles to belong to the medical profession and be acknowledged as such shows that the dispute between homeopaths and al lopaths was a political rather than an epistemological one. Consequently, resistance, marginalization, professional control, and regulation were deeply influenced by the specific state policies in each historical period, the state structures that implement ed such policies, and the particular position of these two professional medical groups within these state structures. This chapter, hence, 23 shows how homeopathy evolved as a subaltern social movement that resisted the hegemonic process of professionalization from t he mid -19th century to the 1920s. In the final chapter, I analyze the failed efforts of graduates from other free schools to resist the marginalization of medical practice by the sanitary code of 1926. I argue in the first section that the DSP enforced its sanitary polic y and turned into a regulator of professional medical training as a result of the ELHM's political ability to obtain its recognition as an official medical school. The shifting policies of the Maximato (1928 -34) together with the conflicts between the state and the university resulted in new regulations that the SEP used to shy away from its responsibility to regulate free schools and the DSP used to ban free school graduates from the medical registry. In the absence of an agreement between t he SEP and the DSP regarding adequate medical training, the latter became an office that specifically surveyed free schools to pr ove they lacked official credentials to grant medical degrees. In the second section, I explore how the DSP changed its approac h to police medical advertising from trying to convince practitioners of their compliance with the sanitary code to generating legal procedures that helped sanitary authorities frame legal cases that ensured practitioners b oth pa id fines and complied with the sanitary code. Finally, I analyze the arguments that homeopaths used to unfruitfully convince President Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez (1932 -34) and sanitary authorities to incorporate their demands in a new version o f the sanitary code in 1934. The se letters highlighted the conflict between sanitary authorities , ENM graduates , and homeopaths in terms of class struggle, professional competition, and the suitability of homeopathy as a scientific medicine for the working class. They used a social democra tic rhetoric to convince the revolutionary government that supporting homeopathy aligned with the purposes and aims of the revol ution. I conclude with a reflection about the limits of both top -down approaches to 24 regulation of the medical profession through sanitary campaigns and bottom up social mobilizations that aimed to limit or modify state intervention. 25 Chapter 1: Medicine \"for the Mexican People\": Liberal Medicine, the Medical Marketplace, and Domestic Homeopathy in Mexico, 185 3-1901 On 17 August 1901, Anastasia Rodr\u00edguez , a 55 -year-old woman sought Francisco I. Madero's medical advice to cope with maladies that had started disturbing her three months before . Madero found out that she was sick with \"rheumatism and attacks; crippled... and before that, she had burnt her arm.\" Confidently, he prescribed \"Rhus \", an acronym for Rhus toxicodendron , a homeopathic remedy that according to Juli\u00e1n Family Guide , was useful nts; rheumatism, particularly ... numbness..., and limb rigidity and paralytic resistance\" ; and some forms of fevers related to typhus .1 Three days later, attacks receded, but the rest of Anastasia's complaints persisted. During that month, her mobility and burns improved, yet attacks resumed over and over again. Madero persisted in his prescription, though one month later he decided to prescribe \"magnetized water \". This remedy worked as an emetic at first, and consequently he enhanced such e ffect by prescribing Arnica . Since then every time Anastasia reported that attacks resumed, Madero prescribed this type of water, until she \"notified [him] that precisely [on 6 November ] when she starte d drinking the magnetized water , attacks receded.\" 2 During the second half of the nineteenth century, homeopathy was one of the most widely adopted and discussed medical systems amongst physicians in Europe and North America. In Mexico, its detractors argued that such a system broadly departed from 1 Madero likely used Gonz\u00e1lez's Family Guide as a tool to prescribe homeopathic remedies to his patients; though he had access to other homeopathic treatises produced abroad, particularly France. Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, (M\u00e9xico: Tipograf\u00eda del hospicio, 1899) 177 -8. 2 Madero kept a clinical record of the patients he treated in 1901 and 1902. See the entry for Anastasia Rodr\u00edguez. (FHFIM), 41, 66 (numbers indicate the pages within this document where the clinical cases are located). 26 contempor ary medical science and that it was used by medical entrepreneurs to deceivingly attract clientele .3 Less radical physicians sustained that in the hands of properly trained physicians homeopathy worked, but still further experimentation needed to be carrie d out in order to form a definitive opinion about its contributions to medical science .4 Outside academic medicine, homeopathy spread to members of Mexico's social elites such as Francisco I. Madero. They consumed it as a modern medical commodity that put medical science in the everyday language of non -technically trained people. In turn these literate individuals used homeopathy to provide healing services to illiterate people who could not read a homeopathic manual and take their health in their own hands , or who could not afford to pa y for the travel and services of educated physicians. In order to diffuse homeopathy in Mexico, early practitioners and promoters wrapped this medical system in a set of liberal values and practices that prompted its consumpt ion amongst literate elites, first as patients and later as practitioners. Ram\u00f3n Comellas and the Promotion of Homeopathy as a Liberal Form of Medicine On August 1853, Ram\u00f3n Comellas, a recently arrived Spanish physician, announced the publication of his book Rese\u00f1a de la homeopat\u00eda dedicada a los mexicanos [Outline of Homeopathy Dedicated to the Mexican People] . The timing of homeopathy's introduction to Mexico could not have been better politically and historically situated in terms of its eventual succe ss as a therapeutic approach that organized its practitioners into a profession. The new nation was reconstructing itself under the banners of republicanism and liberalism after earning 3 Manuel Eulogio Carpio commented on homeopathy in Fernando Fomento, 1886) 642-9. 27 its independence from Spain and having experienced deep internal confl icts to establish a democratic form of government during the first half of the nineteenth century. A new \"medical doctrine that was cultivated and cared for in the majority of the civilized world\" , as Comellas advertised homeopathy, fit the needs of a coun try that was striving for reconstruction and modernization .5 Responding to the need to create structures that favored personal freedom and individual legal uniformity, Mexico and its medical institutions went through a radical transformation in the mid-nineteenth century .6 As in other Latin American countries, Mexican physicians belonged to social elites who had access not only to academic training based on Latin and Greek texts, but also to modern philosophies that were flourishing in France and elsewhere in Europe .7 Due to their privileged position, they were key agents in the institutional transformation of medicine. For instance, they banned birth rights as requirement to enroll in medical schools, and any church influence on the structure of the medical curriculum .8 But while these structural changes 5 The newspaper ad is in \"Rese\u00f1a de la homeopat\u00eda Comellas, Rese\u00f1a 1853). The republican reconstruction went from the First Empire led by Santa Ana in 1848, to the Restored Republic when liberals led by Benito Ju\u00e1rez dethroned emperor Maximilian of Habsburg in 1876. F.: El Colegio de M\u00e9xico, A. C., 2010). 6 Though these ideas were discussed in Mexico during the first half of the nineteenth century, it took them almost thirty years and several armed conflicts to establish institutional roots in the Laws of Reform (1855) and the federal constitution of 1857.

At the same time, medical knowledge was also shiftin g and transforming the medical profession. Following French medicine, Hippocratic and Galenic humoralism was ceding to new notions of the healthy and diseased body based on the connection between clinical observations at the bedside and autopsies of dead b odies . Such empirical connection, t he basis of pathologic anatomy , integrated surgical and medical knowledge into one single epistemological apparatus. Pathologic anatomy gave nineteenth -century physicians a privileged access to the body and a specialized understanding of disease that the common people did not have. Elite physicians used such privileged epistemological access to create distance from popular approaches to disease and health. Their political liberalism led them to modernize medical institutio ns, but relying on modern medical knowledge to privilege their professional status led them to perpetuate the former stratification and marginalization of medical practices and knowledges. Comellas' rhetoric to popularize homeopathy capitalize d on the fac t that medical knowledge was a privilege of those who received proper training. In order to replicate the status of medical knowledge for homeopathy, Comellas appropriated strategies elite physicians used to train medical students at professional schools. For instance, he mimicked Manuel Carpio's attempts to make medical knowledge and breakthroughs available to Spanish -speaking medical students at the recently formed School of Medical Sciences .9 Though originally conceived by the 9 Manuel Carpio studied at the Seminary in Puebla where besides learning the scholastic curriculum he learned medicine. During his school years he translated the Aphoris ms of Hippocrates and published them altogether with a translation of Laennec's article about the use of the stethoscope in 1823. After his graduation he promoted the departure from scholasticism and Hippocratic medicine in the sake of French medical scien ce. Manuel Carpio was one the founders of the School of Medical Sciences where he introduced the experimental study of drugs through the works of Francois Magendie. Jos\u00e9 Sanfilippo B, \"El hipocratismo en tiempos Fac ultad de Medicina UNAM La medicina cient\u00edfica y el siglo XIX 29 German physician Samuel Hah nemann in the late eighteenth century, Comellas introduced homeopathy translating a French homeopathic text into Spanish .10 His Rese\u00f1a promised to \"place in people's hands... this gigantic and positive breakthrough in medicine, known and practiced all over Eu rope and most of America; a doctrine that in spite of having only a few years since it started to get known, it has left behind and by much ordinary medicine. \"11 In the book, \"ordinary medicine\" was equated to previous attempts by Hippocrates and the eighte enth- century animist Georg Ernst Stahl to understand disease causation and therapeutic approach in terms of similarity .12 Hahnemann was praised as being responsible for carrying out experiments and systematizing his discoveries into one single law to treat diseases through specific remedies. A medical book that introduced a \"widely -practiced medical breakthrough in Europe \" in Spanish to the Mexican people fit the rhetoric of enlightening the population while mimicking efforts of academic physicians to detach from Hippocratic medicine and introduce modern French medical breakthroughs. mexicano .; Vicente Guarner, \"L'influence M\u00e9xico, 1982) 97 -9. 10 He mentions Guyard as the author of the F rench text. Samuel Hahnemann (1755 -1843) was a German doctor, chemist and translator who severely critiqued therapeutic approaches of his time and in response proposed a new medical system that promised to 'heal without tormenting the patient.' Aligning wi th figures such as Paracelsus, J. B. Van Helmont and G. E. Stahl, he mounted a sustained attack on heroic medicine -bloodletting, purging, blistering, poly -pharmacy, massive doses - which in the lack of better therapeutic resources led him to abandon medici ne. While he dedicated to earn a living through chemistry and translation, he came up with the two central principles of homeopathy, the principle of pure experimentation and the principle of similitude. Roy Porter, The Greatest Benefit to Mankind. A Medic al History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present (Hammersmith, London: HarperCollins, 1997) 674. 11 una carta frontpage. 12 Comellas quoted texts where they explained that what cause a specific disease or ailment was its own therapeutic remedy. For instance, 'vomit cured vomit', or 'burnt skin was cured approaching the af fected parts to fire.' 30 Nevertheless, the way Comellas constructed homeopathy in his book blurred the boundaries between professional and public medical knowledge and practice that elite physicians were trying to build. By using symptoms as the basis for disease understanding and the experimental assessment of new drugs, homeopathy mirrored people's everyday somatic experiences. Patients such as Anastasia Rodr\u00edguez could describe with no problem their pa in or maladies; what circumstances modified them; the physical appearance of the affected or wounded part of the body; digestive sensations or disorders; characteristics of bodily fluids such as stools, urine, and expectorations; their skin appearance; fev ers; and sleeping disorders. These somatic phenomena and symptoms constituted the homeopathic \"vital reaction \". Through this connection, patients could actually grasp through their personal experience what Comellas explained in his book. Moreover, he used such intimate individual experiences to instruct his readers about what they needed to know in order to identify a disease and report it to a doctor .13 The connection between symptoms and disease diagnosis turned homeopathy into the medicine for the people. Moreover, the theoretical foundations of homeopathy attracted the untrained public because they framed disease understanding in an uplifting language that emphasized life rather than death. Comellas explained that the homeopathic system was founded on the idea that \"life was the result of... an invisible, immaterial, dynamic, or virtual principle, called vital force\".14 The efforts of the \"vital force\" against agents that disturbed the regular and organic harmo ny of the body constituted the \" vital reaction \". Emphasizing the idea that homeopathy was based on a \"vital force \" turned out to be much more uplifting to non-trained audiences than heroic therapies 13 Comellas, \u00f3 de una carta 8. 31 which debilitated the body and caused patients' discomfort .15 Moreover, rather than disease being a sign of the dissipation of vital strength, in the homeopathic system disease was precisely the vital reaction that indicated that the body was fighting to recover its organic stability. In these terms, disease was les s an omen of death than a sign of life. Comellas's approach to introducing homeopathy into Mexican society bridged boundaries between homeopaths and patients that physicians with an approach based on anatomic pathology and heroic therapies could not. Comellas was clear about the importance of consulting a physician. His book was specifically designed to train patients how to \"fruitfully consult a homeopathic physician \", as the book's subtitle stated .16 In that sense, he perpetuated the tradit ional patient -doctor relationship. But homeopathy's symptomatic approach and theory of disease based on vitalism allowed an actual conversation between patient and doctor as a consequence of a shared understanding of disease which translated into a common medical language. Disease explanations that were foreign to patients' everyday experience together with invasive or unpleasant therapies turned patients into subjects rather than participants in the patient -doctor relationship. Such differences s hifted patients' perceptions toward regular medicine. While they regarded physicians and their practice as distant, antipathetic, despotic , and frequently a sign of impending death ,17 Comellas' representation of homeopathic practice as empathetic , connected, and life -affirming made them prefer homeopathy.18 15 The people understood homeopathy as a gentle therapy based on the law of similar ity. For instance, in 1857 one journalist criticized a new law to regulate the public press because it seemed homeopathic. Former laws had not solved the problem the new one intended to. Rather, the journalist proposed to use emetics -that is radical solut ions- to cure una carta frontpage. 17 Claudia Agostoni suggests that poor patient -doctor communications and uncertainty in the face of disease made the general public regard doctors the way I describe them. Claudia Agos toni, \"M\u00e9dicos 32 Comellas' Rese\u00f1a also accommodated the liberal project through the means he used to publicize it. The liberal project sought to transform urban spaces into commercial landscapes ,19 and Co mellas' use of a newspaper t o advertise his own book suggests he aimed to turn homeopathy into a therapeutic commodity that better positioned him in the competitive medical marketplace of Mexico City . He used patients' anxieties about contemporary heroic therapies to highlight homeop athy's gentleness and, hence, to attract customers. Accordingly, homeopat hy had healing means that were \"truthful, soft and expedite\" and the homeopathic doctor did not \"make the patient drink any repugnant beverage, use bloodletting or leeches to weaken t he patients' body, or torment the patient with mustard plasters, cupping, caustics, setons, etc.\"20 Comellas aimed to position homeopathy in people's minds not by showing that it was a logically consis tent, or scientifically proven \u2014 in other words, rationa l or positivist \u2014 medical system, but by accommodating it to people's needs. Homeopathic practitioners had diagnostic tools that disrupted the nature of traditional medical consultations , better positioning them in the competitive urban medical marketplace . The traditional doctor -patient relationship, based on careful observation and follo w-up of patients' symptoms and \u2014 increasingly with the adoption of pathologic anatomy \u2014 signs, demanded the physical presence of the physician to actually diagn ose the patient. In this ecuestres, el arte de curar y los approaches based on heroic therapies and surgery contri buted to the image of doctor as a messenger of death, too. John Harley Warner explains that throughout the nineteenth century American physicians slowly but progressively reduced the use of heroic therapies. The case of Mexican physicians remains to be stu died. John Harley Warner, The Therapeutic Perspective: Medical Practice, Knowledge, and Identity in America, 1820 -1885 (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1997). 18 For an (1 de septiembre) (1874): 117 -8, 321 -3. 19 Steven Bunker explains how throughout the mid -nineteenth century, and propelled by liberal reforms, three types of advertising developed in Mexico City, newspap ers being one of them. The other two were street hawking, and shop signs. Steven B. Bunker, Creating Mexican Consumer Culture in the Age of Porfirio D\u00edaz (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 2012) 59 20 \"Rese\u00f1a de la homeopat\u00eda dedicada \u00e1 los mexicanos.\" 33 traditional relationship, it was \u2014 more often than not wealthy \u2014 families who summoned the physician to their dwellings. There, the physician could closely follow the patient's natural history of disease and prescribe accordingly, consuming the entire physician's time. In contrast, taking advantage of the homeopathic symptomatic approach to disease, a homeopathic physician did not need to be physically present to make a diagnosis. Comellas' used this advantage in the newspaper ad an d in the subtitle of his Rese\u00f1a , where he proposed to inform people about the \"homeopathic regime and instruction to fruitfully consult a homeopathic physician, at least by a letter or a text. \"21 Patients' stories that recounted symptoms were mailed to the homeopathic physician, who did not waste time traveling from one patient's house to another and consequently dedicated his time to diagnose from the comfort of his private study, saving time and money. This non -physical mode of diagnosis might have appeale d to female patients who did not want to expose their bodies to the scrutiny of someone else's eyes. Comellas ' Rese\u00f1a introduced homeopathy to a Mexican audience, but could not alone create homeopathic practitioners. The availability of homeopathy books t hat linked names of diseases, names of homeopathic remedies , and a list of both disease and drug symptoms in the Mexican marketplace, however, did .22 With these books, a reader of Comellas' book had everything he or she needed to become a homeopathic practi tioner. For [The Homeopath's Guide] offered, as the subtitle expressed, a survey of 21 Emphasis mine. Comellas, Rese\u00f1a sobre la carta frontpage. 22 The Librer\u00eda Univeral located in Mexico City distributed works written by important foreign homeopaths at the end of the 1850s. The advertisement reflects that the bookstore owner believed there was a market for books about homeopathy, and suggests the growing interest of residents in this topic. Among the titles a patient interested in homeopathy could find were Ruoff's de ; 4 de abril 1860. 34 \"more than a thousand diseases \" that homeopathic physicians around the globe had successfully treated . This text did not explain homeopathy. Instead, the author offered a catalogue of diseases \"using the names of the old school nosology\" with their correspondent homeopathic remedies.23 With Comellas' and Ruoff's works, and other homeopathic treatises of the 1850s , the Mexican literate public could \"treat [themselves] with homeopathy in most cases, and in those urgent or serious ones, provide efficacious first aids to those who suffer from a disease until a homeopathic physician arrives. \"24 Comellas' project o f popularizing homeopathy in Mexico turned out to be the epitome of the liberal project in the medical sciences, turning it into a form of domestic medicine, a practice that academic physicians critiqued for the same reasons they critiqued the homeopathic lay practice, the sustraction of the academically trained doctor from the therapeutic intervention.25 In contrast to medical elites' efforts to transform medical institutions yet retain the privileges of professional stratification, Comellas ' strategies to promote homeopathy used liberal sentiments and practices that threatened the stratified professional structure. Comellas' promotion of homeopathy promised to make accessible and public what physicians considered 23 A. J. C. Ruoff, Gu\u00eda del home\u00f3pata \u00f3 tratamiento de from the 2nd German edition by G. L. Strauss and into Spani sh by A. P. y F. (Madrid: Imprenta y librer\u00eda de home\u00f3pata , trans. From the German edition by Leon Merchant and To the Spanish version by Tom\u00e1s Pellicer, 2nd 1856). 25 Constantine Hering's book might have been advertised as such. The Librer\u00eda franco -mexicana advertised it as Medicina homeop\u00e1tica ; venta en la librer\u00eda franco -mexicana.\" The book's complete title was not advertised as such in the newspaper ad of the Librer\u00eda Universal , but the catalogue of the National Library of Spain holds one edition with such a name. This edition might have been distributed in Mexico. For the critique of domestic medicine manuals see Francisco de As\u00eds Flores y Troncoso, \"Ejercicio de la medicina Fomento, 1886) 254 -6. 35 knowledge reserved to those who had been pro perly trained in medical science , the understanding of bodily processes, the causes of disease, and proper medical intervention . While Comellas' Rese\u00f1a homeopathy opened the possibility of having an understanding of the body and disease to any literate cit izen, it still preserved the traditional status of the physician and patient -doctor relationship . But with homeopathic domestic manuals, t hose who used homeopathy did not need a physician anymore. Comellas' effort to popularize medical knowledge through hi s homeopathic manual evolved into ways to provide people with tools to heal themselves. With patients turning into homeopathic practitioners and practices that made them competitive in the medical market place, homeopathy soon started to displace trained physicians at the bedside. As I will analyze in the following section, domestic manuals became one of the strategies to sell homeopathic commodities in the nascent medical marketplace in Mexico City that resulted in an extended use of homeopathy amongst the literate Mexican public. Homeopathy as a Medical Commodity: Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, Domestic Medicine and the Mexican Medical Marketplace In the 1860s homeopathy became a therapeutic brand. Jos\u00e9 Salvador Riera, a graduate of the University of Yucat\u00e1n, advertise d his services in El Tabasque\u00f1o , offering to treat people \"according to the circumstances \" with \"allopathy or homeopathy\".26 Jos\u00e9 Carb\u00f3 offered his services at his homeopathic dispensary in 1857 .27 Homeopathy's widespread use led stores to specifically target their products to consumers of homeopathic medicine. Chocolate companies advertised products crafted specially without scents and substances that opposed the homeopathic regime, and chocolate f actories in Mexico City even competed to offer products 26 \"Jos\u00e9 Salvador Riera,\" El tabasque\u00f1o Noviembre 23 Avisos 12 de noviembre 1857. The same ad appeared in the same daily newspaper throughout October and November. 36 that homeopathic physicians authorized .28 Homeopathic dispensaries and drugstores started to populate the landscape of Mexico City. Pascual Bielsa sold first -aid kits and administered his own homeopat hic dispensary ,29 and Mariano Omedes de Viela, who started offering his services as a homeopathic physician in September 1867 , opened a dispensary i n December of that same year and w as still offering its services in 1870 .30 The \"General Agency of the Leipsik [sic] Central Institute of Homeopat hy\" and the \"Deposit of Homeopathic Medicines \" offered homeopathic books, medicines , and other materials for the homeopathic practitioner in the mid 1870s.31 This trend suggests that there was a market of providers, both apothecaries and physicians, and consumers of homeopathy. However, what furthered people's appropriation of homeopathy as domestic medicine was the s elling of homeopathic manuals together with ready - to-use homeopathic first -aid kits. Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez playe d a central role in transforming homeopathy from a medical system used by physicians into a therapeutic commodity with which patients could self -medicate. He became acquainted with homeopathy through Comellas' ads around 1850, when seeking treatment for ch ronic enteritis .32 The effectiveness of Comellas' homeopathic treatment \"Importante,\" Diari marzo acreditada y segunda clate superior Diario de Avisos 22 de septiembre 1860. 29 See correspondence between Pascual Bielsa, the minister of Governance, the government of the Federal District and the Superior Sanitary Board, AHSS, SP, EM, 3, 53. 30 j unio 1870. 31 \"Agencia general del Instituto Central El siglo diez y Iberia S\u00e1bado 25 de Diciembre 1875. 32 Gonz\u00e1lez suffered intermittent fever and was treated with quinine sulfide. He healed, but the drug produced chronic enteritis. Gonzalez does not specify how long he suffered of this health problem, but being chronic suggests a long and persistent conditio n. When he received the homeopathic treatment he soon felt better and in less than six months he was completely recovered. deep impression that led Gonz\u00e1lez to associate with Comellas and open a public dispensary .33 A decade later, his small business turned into a \"deposi t of pharmaceutical specia lties\", where Gonz\u00e1lez sold \" homeopathic first -aid kits along with a booklet that provided inst ructions to use them\".34 Homeopathy was but one of the medical products or patent medicines with which he diversified his drugstore . \"Doctor L\u00f3pez's anti -vener eal tonic ... also called infallible\" ; the \"treasure of the mouth\" which \"eradicated bad breath and tooth decay\" ; \"t children's amulet incantation eradicated cramps, flatulence, diarrhea,\" among other children illnesses; \"Bouillon's emmenagogue powders, the best remedy against menstrual disorders, birt h pains, flow and white flowers\"; \" Dr. Pariset anti - hemorrhoid, of surpris ing effects against hemorrhoids\" ; are a few examples of t he multiple pharmaceutical specialties offered by Gonzalez's dispensary .35 At the turn of the 1870s the homeopathic section of Gonz\u00e1lez's drugstore started to diversify and consolidate, turning into the center of his publicity machine .36 In 1869, he offered globules and tinctures ,37 and two years later, he published a manual of homeopathic remedies38 and his Tratado pr\u00e1ctico de homeopat\u00eda y gu\u00eda familias [Practical Treatise of Homeopathy 33 A. Garc\u00eda Sadas and Manuel M. Romero, \" Biograf\u00eda,\" El Combate 11 de abril 1878. 34 \"Interesante,\" Diario de Avisos 3 de mayo 1860. 35 See his ads in \"Interesante a los enfermos,\" La Iberia S\u00e1bado enfermos,\" El Ferrocarril 15 de julio 1869. 36 This shift coincided with Gonzalez sponsorship of the Instituto Homeopatico Mexicano [Mexican Homeopathic Institute], the first enduring homeopathic society in the nineteenth century. He fund ed its journal and provided facilities for the society's professional meetings. He also gave free medical consultations and homeopathic medicines. Francisco P\u00e9rez Ortiz, \"Discurso a enfermos.\" 38 Gonzalez advertised his new book, La aplicaci\u00f3n de los remedios homeop\u00e1ticos on 2 November 1871. He also started to publish almanacs every year, where he included \"common diseases and means to heal them, certifications of successful treatments, varieties, and a diversity of articles useful for people living in the city or in the countryside.\" Juli\u00e1n G onz\u00e1lez, 2 1871. 38 and Family Guide] .39 His Tratado became the tool with which Gonz\u00e1le z diffused homeopathy and profited from it. In 1873, he started a dvertising his dispensary as a \" Homeop athic Drugstore\". 40 Moreover, he offered \"a great variety of homeopathic first -aid kits and portable drugstores \"41 that w ere specifically \"useful for trav elers, rural populations and haciendas , who not always are in the condition to receive professional medical assistance. \"42 He recommended his Tratado as the most suitable to use the homeopathic kits. Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez used the popularity of homeopathy to tran sform his drugstore into the most important homeopathic pharmacy in Mexico in the second half of the nineteenth century .43 By bringing laissez -faire politics into medicine, Gonz\u00e1lez's approach to sell ing homeopathy exploited the modern liberal political ec onomy that aimed to detach Mexico from its colonial economic structures and push it forward as a modern nation .44 Through this approach he also transformed the way the public consumed homeopathy. His manuals, first -aid kits, and portable drugstores became a means by which people could entirely appropriate their own health, rather than simply consult with success a homeopathic physician, as Comellas pretended. 39 This work eventually turne d into the main text with which Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez publicized homeopathy. It went through at least four editions throughout the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, Tratado ambos de agosto 1873. The last newspaper advertised pharmacy throughout August 1873. 41 \"Botica homeop\u00e1tica.\" 42 \"Medicinas,\" El Combate 3 15 de agosto de 1878 . Gonzalez reiteratively advertised his drug store in La Colonia Espa\u00f1ola during December and January 1878 -9. 43 His was the most conspicuous, but not the only one. For instance, M. Omedes de Viela started offering his services as a homeopathic physician in the 1860s in the same terms as Comellas, but a decade later he started using it as a brand for therapeutic remedies, just like Gonz\u00e1lez did. \"Dr. M. Homedes de diciembre, 1875. 44 For a shor t review of the notion of market in the nineteenth century see chapter 1 in Richard Weiner, Race, Nation, and Market: Economic Culture in Porfirian Mexico (Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 2004). 39 Gonzalez's commercial approach went beyond Comellas' book advertisement and consultation by mail, fo r who could travel from one point to another, with an allopathic drugstore, or [who] could even use it without being a professional pharmacist or physician? This would be unattainable for a family. But a complete homeopathic first -aid kit, no matter how b ig, can be carried along any distance by a single person who needs no more than carefully and persistently consult the manual to use the kit.45 The public reception of Gonz\u00e1lez's homeopathic manuals and products was divided. Academic physicians labeled it a lucrative business that had nothing to do with medicine .46 Jos\u00e9 Galindo, a graduate of the National School of Medicine, considered Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez's approach to sell ing homeopathic manuals and first -aid kits as a robbery, and those who pursued healing as Gonz\u00e1lez recommended as \"speculat ors\" of health. According to Galindo, the homeopathic business had a \" low risk \" and was \"productive\" . [A] speculator ... invests 22 pesos in Freleigh's manual and first -aid kit, the most expensive and complete one, and assum ing that he treats two patients a day who pay 2 pesos for the homeopathic consultation, he earns 120 pesos a month. With it, he recovers the investment and has a huge profit only by visiting two patients and reading the manual two or three hours a day.47 Francisco Flores de As\u00ed s, another graduate of the medical school, severely critiqued manuals of domestic medicine and the people who used them in 1886 . He argued that \"the mob\" used called 'do to \"treat the sick only after [the mob] has learned from a [trained] physician the disease diagnosis. \" These practitioners or aficionados got rid of the physician once they learned 45 Gonz\u00e1lez, Tratado pr\u00e1ctico de homeopat\u00eda y gu\u00eda de las familias xvii. 46 This rhetoric of marginalization was typical within the community of academic physicians during the second half of the 19th century. In order to consolidate their professional status, academic physicians distanced themselves from popu lar approaches to health and disease, labeling them as unscientific. Agostoni, \"M\u00e9dicos cient\u00edficos y II.22 (noviemb the specific name of a patient's ailment and started to medicate according to what the domestic manual indicated. For him, domestic manuals of medicine usurped, to the patient's harm, the doctor's place at the bedside, for it was only the \"physician's eye \", the trained medical gaze acquired in \"good books of me dicine and through a not -poor medical practice \", the single means to diagnose a disease accurately.48 Physicians' critiques expressed their discomfort about the commercial use of homeopathy and domestic medicine in a competitive medical marketplace. Their p rofessional status as graduates of the National School of Medicine made them adopt a position that privileged the scientific medical knowledge they had received at the medical school to distance themselves from other healing practices . In contrast, the pu blic embraced Go nz\u00e1lez's products and publicity , prizing them as either an effort that \"benefited all the classes of society \" by bringing health to the population49 or a proof of \"generosity, detachment ,... charity,... kindness [, and] philanthropy \".50 Generally, those who consumed Gonz\u00e1lez's homeopathic products were patients who just like him had been successfully treated with homeopathy and who dedicated their lives to understand ing how it worked, popularizing its use, and provid ing homeopathic treat ment, in other words, those who m Galindo criticized. It was the y who boasted the benefits of homeopathy and the philanthropy of their homeopathic providers, as in the case of Luis Alva. He was one of Gonz\u00e1lez's patients. In return for Gonz\u00e1lez's kindness a nd effective treatment, Alva decided to publicize homeopathy through a pamphlet in 1883 .51 This pamphlet was later reprinted in the fourth edition of Gonz\u00e1lez's Treatise , where Alva congratulated Gonz\u00e1lez for his medical intervention and altruistic behavior . 48 Flores y Troncoso, \"Ejercicio de la 51 homeopat\u00eda y ante la humanidad doliente y ante la raz\u00f3n (M\u00e9xico: Manuel S. Gutierrez, 1883). 41 According to reports published by homeopathic practitioners, patients' gratitude praised homeopathic treatment itself, rather than Gonz\u00e1lez's products and publicity. But it was evident that such reports aimed to attract a larger clientele. Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1l ez and other homeopathic practitioners used their patients' reports as proof of the effectiveness of homeopathy. For instance, Gonz\u00e1lez advertised that his homeopathic remedies were famous because they healed patients deemed incurable by famous doctors. Fu rthermore, he included his clinical statistics of success in the ad, \"4000 blood impurities, 230 skin diseases, 414 stomach diseases, 102 urinary diseases, 60 eye diseases, and 534 diseases that were not mentioned. \"52 Most of these reports were similarly st ructured to praise the clinical successes of homeopathic practitioners. Due to, for instance, a discouraging prognosis or the harming effects of heroic medications, distressed patients sought another medical option, homeopathy; patient's choice s improved t heir health condition and left them satisfied with the outcome. It is unclear who wrote such reports : patients, homeopathic practitioners themselves, or both , the former to show their gratitude, and the latter to increase their clientele. In any case, the publication of these reports was solely the homeopathic practitioners' responsibility, which raises doubts about their authenticity. Some reports added other elements to heighten their credibility, like the impartiality of the observer who reported the ca se of Rafael Navarre te, a homeopathic practitioner who had successfully treated a child with Croup , a breathing difficulty caused by inflammation of the vocal cords especially in infants and children . The reporter started his note by clarifying that he was not particularly fond of the homeopathic system, but having evidenced the \"practical results \", \"palpa ble facts \", and \"happy healings \" made him acknowledge the new system's effectiveness. The construction of the reporter's credibility was based on his inte llectual distance from the homeopathic system and hence his nature as an impartial observer. Yet when the 52 The latter category might have referred to venereal diseases. \"Botica homeop\u00e1tica.\" 42 impartial reporter recognized that it was his friend who acquainted him with the facts, the reporter's credibility seems to crumble.53 Who should the reader of such a case report believe : the impartial reporter or the gratified patient? For medically trained physicians such as Jos\u00e9 Galindo, these reports were a clear example of how to \"deceive na\u00efve people\" , but patients willing to find a cure might hav e read them otherwise .54 When Guadalupe L\u00f3pez de Herrera consulted Miguel Alva, a homeopathic practitioner, he recommended she receive spiritual counseling for he was not sure if homeopathy could do anything for her peritonitis, but the \"persistence, effica cy and determination \" of the practitioner achieved the \"surprising \" and unexpected healing .55 The use of outstanding homeopathic clinical successes continued until the first decade of the twentieth century, when not only patients reported successful cases, but also authorities such as the police from all over the country provided certificates to homeopathic practitioners who healed and \"saved thousands of people, most of them with terrible progn ostic s, without having any dead .\"56 53 A. G. B. [Alfredo G. Bianchi], 54 Gabino Barreda introduced the idea of homeopathy as a means to deceive na\u00efve people . In 1861, or a critical appraisal of this new means to deceive na\u00efve people]. Academic physicians used the arguments contained in this work to dis credit homeopathy throughout the second half of the 19th century. It was reprinted in 1877 with a different (1902). Then the Cr\u00f3nica M\u00e9dica reprinted it in several numbers of the volume 7 in 1904. Finally, it was printed in 1934 as a monograph, by Acci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica , the medical journal of the Union of Physicians from the Fede ral District. 55 F. O., \"Sorprendente curaci\u00f3n,\" El Combate 27 de junio 1880. 56 For instance see letters addressed to Juan Pablo de los R\u00edos in the 1890s showing the unexpected healings he achieved with homeopathy. \"El Sr. D. Juan Pablo de los R\u00edos,\" El Cor reo Espa\u00f1ol 18 de noviembre 1890. ; Dr. Juan los R\u00edos,\" Correo Espa\u00f1ol 1 de enero 1891. ; and \"El Sr. Dr. D. Juan Pablo de los R\u00edos,\" El Correo Espa\u00f1ol 6 de enero 1891. See also the reports published in \"Al p\u00fablico,\" La propaganda homeop\u00e1tica IV.4 (1904). 43 The interpretation of such reports is complicated by academic physicians' reports of homeopathic practice. In 1874, Juan Fenelon, a member of the recently created National Academy of Medicine, reported a case describing a woma n who suffered from hemorrhages. After being treated by several physicians and then using \"ordinary remedies \", another physician diagnosed a uterine polyp, a mass of cells that grew within the uterus and caused the bleeding. But facing surgery, the patient and her family decided to consult a homeopath , who according to Fenelon fed the patient's and her familiy's fears and offered them \"a miraculous healing\" . When the family sought Fenelon's opinion, he found the patient in a state close to death, yet \"they were not determined to abandon homeopathy. \" Fenelon even highlighted that Mr. Navarrete ,57 the homeopath treating the woman, had made special emphasis on not bathing the patient, a situation that worsened the infection she was suffering. Fenelon notified th e family of the imminent danger of an i nfection and another hemorrhage and recommended to anesthetize the patient in order to make the proper diagnosis and indicate possible ways of acting. Fenelon finished his report emphasizing his indignation with \"the guilty ignorance of a curandero , that allowed [a patient] to reach such a deplorable state in a curable disease, \" and lamenting similar cases that did not reach the public arena. He offered to publish his own observations of such malpractices, \"if only the public was not fond of being deceived.\"58 What coincides in both homeopaths' and academic physicians' reports of clinical cases where homeopathy was used as the main treatment is that patients were satisfied and willing to continue homeopathic treatments in spite of the most adverse medical situations. To Fenelon's surprise, patients preferred to stay with homeopathy and face death rather than surrender their 57 This homeopath might have certainly been Rafael Navarrete. \"ACADEMIA DE 117 -8, 321 - 3. 44 bodies to physical examination or surgical intervention, probably waiting for the unexpected and surprising recovery, as patients' accounts suggest. This preference reveals homeopaths' ability to attract customers and keep them faithful to the ir therapeutic approac h. Homeopaths' strategy to commercialize their therapeutic innovation was effective in te rms of patients' satisfaction and commitment to stick with one specific therapeutic approach. Moreover, academic physicians implicitly recognized such success when they criticized the profit homeopaths made or when they accused academic physicians who used homeopathy as \"immoral [people] whose speculative conduct led them to robbery. \"59 The popularity of homeopathy amongst patients attested to the success of homeopaths in penetrating the healing marketplace. These accounts also prove the success of homeopat hs in advertising and addressing their therapeutic system to the people. For homeopathic entrepreneurs, patients' satisfaction was the core of their campaign to extend the use of homeopathy. What remains unclear is the source of patients' fear of academic doctors' therapeutic interventions. Did they prefer homeopathy because they believed it produced surprising healings, as homeopathic entrepreneurs advertised and patients' reports suggest? Were they simply responding to the interventional diagnostic and th erapeutic approach of pathologic anatomy? Were there other beliefs involved in patients' choice? To explore these questions in greater depth and understand the context in which patients' appropriated and use homeopathy, I will analyze the homeopathic practice of one of the pivotal political leaders at the turn of the twentieth century, Francisco I. Madero. 59 Galindo, \"La homeopat\u00eda.\" , Prac tice of Homeopathy in Rural Mexico Madero's iconic place in the political history of Mexico and his unorthodox religious and medical beliefs inclined the historian Enrique Krauze to call him the \"mystic of freedom \".60 Madero's life represents the cultural values that dominated amongst social and economic elites in Mexico in the last decades of the nineteenth century. The modern education based in science he received together with their deep religious beliefs combined i nto a fertile ground where homeopathy flourished. Madero's use of homeopathy was not a result of homeopaths' publicity and promotion, nor did his political inclinations lead him to a medical practice that ran against professional corporate bodies. Rather, his interest in healing stood at the base of his religious - based moral transformation. His experiences using homeopathy both as a patient and as a practitioner, together with his spiritualist practices and magnetic healing, are a window to understand how t his medical novelty fit in the cultural landscape of rural Mexico, where elites offered modern medical commodities as charity to their workers at the turn of the twentieth century. Francisco I. Madero (1873 -1911) was the first son of one of the wealthiest families in northern Mexico. As such he received an elite education in Mexico, France , and the United States .61 The training in business administration and agriculture he received in Paris and at Berkeley allowed him to successfully run his family's ranchos and businesses. Yet it was the contact with Allan Kardec's spiritualist philosophy in Paris in 1889 that marked his personal life. He confesse d in his memoirs that the Catholic religio n seemed to him \" obscure and irrational \", 60 Enrique Krauze, Francisco I. Madero. M\u00edstico de la liber (Mexico: Fondo de Cultura Econ\u00f3mica, 1987). 61 He studied at a Jesuit school in Saltillo, the Saint Mary College in Baltimore, the School of High Studies of Commerce, and at the Department of Agriculture in the University of California, Berkeley. As a result of this education, he became fluent in Fren ch and English. Francisco Ignacio Madero, Memorias de Francisco I, IX vols. (M\u00e9xico: Editorial Cl\u00edo, Libros y Videos, S. A. de C. V., 1998) 25 -32. 46 and that at the time, he had \"no belief \", so he was in an \"impartial and dispassionate \" position to appraise French Spiritualism. When Madero read Allan Kardec's works, he \"devoured \" them. He found his \"doctrines so rational, so beautiful, [and] so new \" that he was \"seduced \". Madero became a \"spiritualist \", though he did not actually practice d spiritualism un til he experienced the solitude of the rural life in 1893 .62 The connection between spiritualism, charity, and healing is pivotal to understand ing the key role that health and dise ase played in Madero's moral transformation. Madero define d spiritualism as a \"science that investigates the forces of the human spirit \". Such science led to a specific form of ethics according to which every person's duty was to pursue happiness by strugg ling against his or her bad inclinations . These included emotional attitudes such as anger, egoism, and vanity, as well as more material vices such as alcoholism, overeating, and other pleasures. \"With these vices, health and will are rapidly lost \", Madero said. He argued that spiritualism, hard work, and charity helped a person to overcome such inclinations and vices, but healing above all provided the best means to personal development.63 Madero practiced such means. When he learned about homeopathy in 189 6,64 he used it for charitable purposes. He personally visited his peones to prescribe homeopathic remedies and comfort them in their diseases. One of his intimate friends said that \" in the city, someone could see how diseased menesterosos [working -class people] besieged him; and he comforted their 62 Madero settled permanently in Mexico in this yea r. Manuel Guerrera de VI, IX vols. (M\u00e9xico: Editorial Cl\u00edo, Libros y Videos, S. A. de C. V., 2000) 20 -3. 63 Francisco Ignacio Ignacio Madero (M\u00e9xico: Editorial Cl\u00edo, Libros y Videos, S. A . de C. V., 2000). 64 There is no consensus about who precisely introduced Francisco I. Madero to homeopathy. Krauze says that Madero's father and uncle, Catarino Benavides, introduced him to homeopathy. Madero says in his Memoires that he learned about it when Colonel Carlos Herrera asked his father to bring a homeopathic first-aid kit. Krauze, Francisco I. Also see Madero, Memorias 33. 47 pain, consoled their sorrows, and provided them with economic resources \".65 Through healing, he rediscovered his gift as a spiritual medium and set it to practice .66 Communications with spirits info rmed him about the importance of disease as a means to purification. One of the spirits told him \"your disease is a punishment too, and you will not heal until you correct yourself. I am sure that if you healed now, you would follow the path of corruption you were in before \".67 For this reason, Madero stopped smoking after being sick, drinking after his mother fell sick with typhoid fever, and married Sara P\u00e9rez to leave a dissolute life. Spiritual communications also informed him about the need for disease to strengthen his bond with spiritual forces and the link that healing created between the medium and spirits. For instance, one spirit explained that a long and harsh disease made her die softly, because such a disease process \"made her spirit detach from the matter little by little \" to the extent that when she passed away her \"spirit was free already \".68 According to Madero's \"spiritualist morality \", healing was the most important means of charity through which individuals participated in altruistic activi ties that in turn strengthen ed their connection with spiritual forces and facilitated 65 Cited in Krauze, Francisco I. Madero. M\u00edstico de la libertad 15. Krauze seemed to have taken the reference from Pedro Lamicq, Madero. Por uno de sus \u00edntimos (Mexico: Oficina editorial Azteca, 1915) 10.He was also immersed in other charity enterprises. He organized a poorhouse in his own dwellings where he fed and provi ded shelter to the poor. With his wife, Sara P\u00e9rez, he supported orphans and students, and founded elementary and commercial schools, welfare institutions, hospitals, and community kitchens. 66 For the historian Madero's spiritualist letters represent an ex cellent window to his thought. While attending spiritualist groups in Paris, mediums told him that he was a writing medium, one who writes what spirits dictate. At that time, he tried to develop such gift without success and quit his attempts. Madero, Memorias 34-5. One night when his brother, Manuel Madero, suffered a gastric fever, he resumed his experiments as a writing medium and realize that 'a force strange to [his] will moved his hand speedily.' Once he became comfortable and confident with this new condition -especially with \"Ra\u00fal\", the spirit of his younger brother who died tragically in 1887 - Madero started to use such ability to seek moral reassurance and medical advice, particularly guidance about remedy election with the spirits. 67 See the letter of 9 January 1901, in Madero, Cuadernos esp\u00edritas, 1900 -1908 35. Six months later, on 9 May 1901, the spirit of Ra\u00fal told Francisco Madero that he believed that Madero's headache was a consequence of abusing tobacco, and he commanded him to 'stop smoking, because such a foolish vice does not do any good to you and it profoundly harms your health.' Madero, Cuadernos esp\u00edritas, 1900 - 1908 41. 68 Letter 26 May 1902, in Madero, Cuadernos esp\u00edritas, 1900 -1908 91. 48 their spiritual development. Raul's spirit specifically equated medicine with \"the power of working as intermediaries of good spirits who came to heal those who suffered. \" Being an intermediary \" elevated the spirits of [those who participated in spiritualist sessions] over others.\"69 Such medical gift was a \"light\" that \"should be used to enlighten the path of your brothers, once it has withdrawn all of you [in the spiritua list session] from darkness \".70 The notion of a connection between spiritual fluidic forces that linked the physical body with some sort of spiritual realm mirrored Comellas' homeopathic concept of the \"vital force\" , making homeopathy a perfect fit as a med ical system for Madero's notion of healing as a way to purification. Madero described in his Manual esp\u00edrita that \"fuerzas an\u00edmicas [psychic forces] came neither exclusively from spiritual nor material sources, and that their complex and mixed nature worke d admirably as proof that our material body was ruled by a spiritual entity. \"71 He argued that \"psychic phenomena\" , particularly the workings of magnetism, evidenced that such was the constitution of the human being . Accordingly, \"magnetism was the vital fluid that worked as intermediary between the soul and the body. When such a fluid weakens, there is disease; when it vanishes, death .\"72 Madero explained the disease cause and the processes of healing with magnetism. He said that severe wounds may cause de ath because they obstructed channels of vital fluid circulation in the body , or that the transmission of \"healthy and strong\" vital fluid to a \"weakened organism \" produced \"a reaction in the fluids of the latter \" that healed physical complaints. One spirit told him that magnetism was useful specifically in treating diseases caused by \"moral infections \", colds, physical weakening and nervous diseases .73 Such descriptions of the workings of fluidic forces in the process of healing mirrored Comellas' and 69 Letter on December 2, 1901, Madero, Cuadernos esp\u00edritas, 1900 -1908 65. 70 1900 Madero, \"Manual Esp\u00edrita,\" 96 Letter of 18 August 1901, in Madero, Cuadernos esp\u00edritas, 1900 -1908 271. 49 the re st of homeopaths' explanations of how homeopathic remedies worked and the specific usefulness of homeopathy in chronic diseases.74 It is unclear to what extent homeopathy influenced Madero's spiritualist beliefs or the other way round. He studied the latt er earlier than the former, but the language, expressions , and reflections used when referring to the processes of healing, the connection of emotions with disease, choosing a homeopathic remedy and its dosage, and following a specific regime are so abunda nt in the homeopathic literature that it is difficult to trace the precise origin of such ideas in Madero's system of thought. Yet rather than causation, the link between homeopathy and spiritualism shows the congruity of such ideologies in a coherent set of beliefs that guided Madero's healing practices. Moreover, for Madero, both spiritualism and homeopathy were empirical sciences. They provided alternative yet modern ways to reflect about religion and morality in a secular world and about healing in a co ntext with limited access to trained physicians .75 74 Madero was simply following the historical trend where Mesmerism -a therapeutic approach that used first magnets and then the therapist own vital magnetism, hence the name of animal magnetism, for healing purposes - evolved into different forms of mind hea ling, such as Ellen G. White Seventh -Day Adventists, Christian Science, and Theosophy. David Schmit, \"Re Psychology: The Dissemination of Mesmerism, 1836 -1854,\" History of Psychology 8.4 (2005). ; Ronald L. Numbers, Prophetess of Health: a Study of Ellen G. White (New York: Harper & Row, 1976). ; Rennie B. Schoepflin, Christian Science on Trial: Religious Healing in America , Medicine, Science, and Religion in Historical Context (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2003). ; and Stephen Prothero, \"From Spiritualism to Theosophy: \"Uplifting\" a Democratic Tradition,\" Religion and American Culture 3.2 (1993). 75 In his Manual esp\u00edrita , he defined spiritualism as an experimental science, and he dedicated a whole section of this man ual to explain the material phenomena on which spiritualism was based on. Madero, \"Manual Esp\u00edrita,\" 96 -108. According to homeopathy, the quest to find the right medication for a specific diseases case was a permanent process of experimentation, as it wa s the quest to find the medical properties of natural substances. Maderos' spiritualist letters show a constant concern to find the right homeopathic remedy, though his personal correspondence evidences his reassurance with homeopathy, probably resulting f rom his personal reflections/communications with spirits. Raul's spirit constantly guided Madero in the election of a homeopathic remedy on the latter's specific request, or reassured him in the election of his own. Francisco Ignacio Madero, Epistolario (1 900-1909) , Archivo de (Mexico: Secretar\u00eda de -1, 68 -9. 50 Comellas and Gonz\u00e1lez turned homeopathy into a mod ern medical commodity in Mexico. Consumers, such as Madero, with a modern mentality, yet isolated from the burgeoning cultural, political , and economic cent er Mexico City was, used it as patients and healers. Madero became an avid consumer of homeopathic literature and first -aid kits, offered both in Mexico City and abroad .76 He bought his first homeopathic manuals from Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez in 1899 and continued ob taining homeopathic supplies from him throughout his life .77 Madero's relatives preferred Gonz\u00e1lez's kits because they \" believed that it was better to use [Gonzalez's] specifics rather than other first -aid kits which required a deeper study .\"78 Such a commen t testifies to how well Gonz\u00e1lez's publicity fit landowners' medical needs in the countryside. At unpopulated almost desolate places in the northern part of Mexico, people needed concise domestic manuals that filled the gap left by physicians' absence. Madero's homeopathic practice provided healing services to his family and peones. He registered accounts of the peones he treated between 1901 and 1902 .79 The importance of His personal correspondence also shows Madero's interest in proving -the homeopathic word for testing - the medicinal properties of native plants. Madero, Epistolario (1900 -1909) 50, 215. 76 For instance, Madero requested books from foreign providers. Most of them were related to spiritualism, though among these he also asked for titles about magnetism such as Delaye's Instrucci\u00f3n pr\u00e1ctica de magnetism animal Don Quint\u00edn L\u00f3pez G\u00f3mez, a provider from Barcelon, Spain, 1902, in Madero, Epistolario (1900 -1909) 41-2. 77 According los ni\u00f1os y homeop\u00e1tica y Manual de familia with the company Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez Sucs. Krauze, Francisco I. Madero. M\u00edstico de la libertad 15. For his later requests to this pharmacy see Madero, Epistolario (1900 -1909) 18, 22, 213, 332. 78 Letter to J. Gonz\u00e1lez Sucs of 21 October 1900, Madero, Epistolario (1900 -1909) 18. 79 Madero entered 248 patients' names in his booklet out of which he explicitly identified 13 as recurring patients. This figure leaves 235 patients' entries. 60% were women and 40% men, ranging from 2 months of age to 75 years with an average of 40. Madero explicitly used the category of age, yet he did not explicitly register the category of sex. Using names and maladies that exclusively identify women I obtained a sex ratio of 0.42 men, 0.57 women. Entries dates range from 27 March 1901 to 25 November 1902 . Most of the times he has from one to five entries registered for one single day, though there were exceptional days when he entered up to 16 cases. Assuming that entries represent Madero's interactions with his patients, we can say that he had regular vi sits during the second half of 1901. These largely 51 Madero's clinical notes lies in their private and personal nature. In contrast to patients' accounts edited and published as publicity for homeopathy, or actual clinical histories carried out by homeopathic physicians, Madero's notes are homeopathic clinical practice in the making, with no sec ondary reflections about how well or not such observations fit the homeopathic corpus or praised homeopathic treatments' success. It is uncertain to what extent Madero transcribed his patients' descriptions, or if he somehow filtered them .80 In any case, hi s note taking represents a construction between the patient and the practitioner that shows how both understood disease. In Madero's clinical notes , disease can be a symptom, an anatomical part, or what we would currently identify as disease s with a micro biological origin. Madero's descriptions of symptoms discussed evacuations, whether from the sexual organs , digestive organs, or the skin; some sorts of pain, such as numbness, burning sensation, colic, and cramps; fever; nervous disorders, like delusions, attacks, faintness, and insomnia; and skin rashes, swellings, sores, and marks. He sometimes used technical terms to refer to such symptoms, such as when he used blennorrhagia to describe white or yellow discharges from sexual organs, yet he sometimes use d the term as a disease category, such as when a male patient described \"a strong pain when urinating, but with no discharge, which made [Madero] think about a possible blennorrhagia .\"81 Lacking a disease classification, Madero sometimes referred to symptom s as a sickness at specific organs. He also used current disease categories, yet it is unclear if he referred to the group of signs and symptoms that we currently correlate with them , or even if he actually decreased in 1902. As to whether he visited them or otherwise is hard to suggest a general trend from the booklet. His notes suggest that sometimes some patients visited him, but in these cases they did it to explain changes in symptoms or to express total recovery after Madero had first prescribed some remedy. 80 While most reports are taken directly from patients' accounts, some of them suggest that symptoms of other patients were referred to him by a thi rd party. 81 Madero's clinical booklet in ASHCP, FHFIM, 27. He used interchangeably -that is as symptoms and diseases - other technical terms such as metrorraghia to refer to irregular menstruations; intermittent to refer to the periodicity and evolution of fevers; chancres; rehuma or rheumatism, to explain some sort of pain or discomfort in specific body parts, and neuralgia, to refer headaches. 52 understood their microbiological origin . Though n ot particularly abundant in his booklet, herpes, dysentery, influenza, pertussis, typhoid fever, pneumonia, flu, and consumption figured as disease categories. Disease etiology was seldom mentioned, and when Madero, or his patient ventured to explain the cause of disease, it did not influence remedy election. Disease etiologies have a regular pattern in his clinical notes. Generally, susto [fright], disgusto [disgust], and coraje [anger] food caused indigestion, stomac haches, and diarrhea; and alcohol ingestion was correlated to liver and nervous illnesses. Some of these etiologies were guessed by patients su ch as when a male reported \" several rheumatic pains which [the patient] attributed to thermal work \", while some o thers were either endorsed or guessed by Madero, such as when one patient showed up with \"a swelling nose produced by breathi ng in the presence of a cadaver.\"82 These two forms of reporting imply that Madero either agreed with the patient's explanation and consequently made it his own, or doubted about the patient's reported etiology and made it clear that it was not his own. Remedy selection is difficult to evaluate since Madero did not explicitly register the reasons why he chose specific remedies. Somet imes he just reported the remedy without even annotating the patient symptoms. In other entries he used the same remedy for different symptomatic descriptions. For instance he used Belladon na in people sick at the stomach, tonsils, or liver, or with cough, nervous attacks, burning sores, swollen eyes, sore throats, headaches, blenorrhagia, and so on. There are other remedies that Madero used specifically for certain complaints, nevertheless. For instance, Merc Sol , an acronym for Mercurius solubilis , was used in every patient that had skin rashes or whenever the patient's wounded part needed to discharge. 82 See the clinical report of Herminio Hernandez and Francisco Tapia, respectively. Madero's clinical booklet in A SHCP, FHFIM, 57, 56. 53 He preferred to use remedies that indicated they suited the environment Madero's peones lived in.83 His magnetic passes or water were generally combi ned with homeopathic medicines, yet he only used magnetism in cases that hinted at an emotional etiology that produced headaches, chest pain, nervous attacks, and general body weakness and pain. Madero struggled to find the adequate remedy for his patient s. For instance, Pilar Pinales showed up with scabies and menstrual disorders, and Madero prescribed Pulsatilla . Two months later Madero reported \"No effect and I gave her Sulfur 1000a \"; six weeks later, \"No effect and I gave her magnetized pills \"; three w eeks later, \"they did not work, Nux moscata \"; one week later, \"Didn' t work. Ferrum net. Didn't work\" ; six months later he prescribed magnetic pills .84 Sometimes homeopathic medicines improved certain conditions, but Madero needed to use new homeopathic reme dies t o attack complaints that persisted , such as in the case of Laura Ram\u00edrez who suffered from rheumatism . He recommended Aconito and Arnica , but \"medicines were not given as prescribed and she showed a poor relief. She has diarrhea ... and is thirsty. Arse nico\" ; a couple of days later he changed to Pulsatilla 30a; and three days later \"pains diminished, she healed from diarrhea and was almost entirely well. \" But two days later, Madero noted that rheumatic pains resumed. He prescribed Bryonia , which didn't w ork and changed to Rhus Toxica 30a, which did. Three days later she showed up with a rash throughout her body. While Merc Sol \"dried \" the rash, the patient was left with headaches and swollen feet. Madero used magnetism, and the headache subsided, but the swollen feet persisted. China and Arnica solved this last malady, yet the last entry of this case stated \"she was entirely relieved\".85 83 An interesting case is the use of Plantago for intermittent fevers. Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez's Family Guide recommended Ipecac or Nux vom for this malady, yet Madero chose Plantago , for in the same manual this homeopathic remedy was recommend ed specially for people who grew vegetables in low and humid lands. Gonz\u00e1lez, Tratado pr\u00e1ctico de homeopat\u00eda y gu\u00eda de las -9. 84 Madero's clinical booklet in ASHCP, FHFIM, 63, 71. 85 Madero's clinical booklet in ASHCP, FHFIM, 41,47,53. 54 These clinical cases show that Madero was a committed homeopathic practitioner. He constantly tried to ascertain his patients ' outcome, which he learned by letter or spoken word, and modified his prescription accordingly. He reported only a few cases \u2014 like the one in the introduction of the chapter \u2014 in which the patient was apparently left with no ailment at all, but only one where the patient died. No case report includes regime indications such as diet or exercise. It seems that he assumed that the homeopathic medicine or magnetism would do the work, though generally homeopathic family guides instructed about the regi me patients should follow, and his spiritualist letters indicate that he was aware of diet .86 It is difficult to assess the efficacy of homeopathic remedies with current medical knowledge, yet it is fair enough to say that homeopathy provided some sort of h ealing for people who had limited access to professional physicians. And for those who had access to them, such as Madero's family, it constituted a way to get rid of their pernicio us methods, for as Madero said \" allopaths do not have medicines for this di sease, and with the syrups and other concoctions they provide, they hurt the patient's stomach, which in turn debilitates more and more the patient, making it difficult for him to heal.\"87 Conclusions During a time of liberal reforms in Mexico, homeopathy b ecame the medicine of the people. Following the French E nlightenment, homeopaths aligned with academic physicians in making contemporary medical knowledge accessible to the literate public. But homeopaths' language and commercial publicity undermined acade mic medicine's exclusivity by popularizing medical knowledge. With a language and publicity that resonated with the cultural values and health needs of the literate population, homeopaths positioned their medical system as an 86 Madero, Cuadernos esp\u00edritas, 1900 -1908 87. 87 Letter to Sr. Don Gregorio D. Zambrano on 17 February 1904. Madero, Epistolario (1900 -1909) 69. 55 alternative therapy that patie nts preferred over other traditional methods . They also placed homeopaths' services in competition with the ones provided by academic physicians. Moreover, homeopathy provided healing services to patients who were unable to afford or unwilling to use the services of regular physicians and was sometimes used by patients to provide healing services to others. In this sense , homeopathy became a medical commodity not only consumed by the people, but also prescribed by the people. Being for the people did not a ctually mean that all the population had immediate access to homeopathy. O nly literate citizens were able to purchase homeopathic kits and manuals, read them, and practice homeopathy. In this sense, homeopathy was still a medical knowledge for elites, thou gh homeopaths popularized it as medical knowledge outside professional c ircles. Illiterate members of the working class had access to homeopathic therapy through charitable efforts of practitioners such as Gonz\u00e1lez and Madero. This meant that only literate individuals could actually become homeopathic practitioners and that the rest of the population who consumed homeopathy remained as patients without the possibility to become practitioners. The liberal medical project that homeopathy represented was still for elites in a country where 75% of the population was illiterate88. Yet homeopathy's popular appeal contributed to its success as a medical commodity during the second half of the nineteenth century in Mexico. Homeopathy's commonsensical disease explana tions and its theory of disease based on vitalism aligned with people's own experience of diseases, how they understood them, and how they related such popular notions of disease with their own religious beliefs and moral lives, as Madero's personal life a nd clinical notes suggest. This shared understanding of the body and disease was the one that allowed popular interest in homeopathy, whether as sellers or consumers, practitioners or patients, 88 Lira and Staples, \"Del desastre a la reconstrucci\u00f3n republicana, 1848 -1876,\" 483. 56 regardless of class distinctions. Homeopathy's success as a me dical commodity was based on the ability of homeopathic entrepreneurs to accommodate it to the needs of customers from different social groups. While homeopathic entrepreneurs addressed urban educated audiences' interest in modern scientific medical commod ities, they also addressed the urban working class highlighting homeopathy's gentle remedies and unexpected and surprising healings. They appealed to rural elites offering ways to cope with the lack of physicians in the countryside. Homeopathy's disruptio n of the traditional doctor -patient relationship produced different reactions in urban and rural settings. In Mexico City, where the higher doctor -patient ratio resulted in a stiffer competition for patients, regular medical practitioners complained about homeopaths' ability to attract and retain customers through inaccurate explanations of diseases. In such a scenario, regular practitioners accused homeopathic domestic manuals and homeopathic consultation as detrimental to the patient. Yet in rural setting s that lacked trained physicians, hacendados prized the possibility that homeopathy gave them to provide healing services on the road, to their families and to their workers, either personally or through mail. Homeopaths competed with physicians in the urban medical marketplace, yet their first -aid kits and manuals provided hacendados with a resource to provide medical relief in the rural landscape. While a close doctor -patient relationship communication accounted for homeopathy's success in the c ity, the possibility to turn any literate individual into a practitioner who could prescribe even by means of a third party or by letter resulted in homeopathy's success in the countryside. Whether in the countryside or in the city, homeopathic domestic ma nuals did not shift people's understanding of disease and healing. In a free medical market, these manuals sought to gain the acceptance of the public and consequently accommodated homeopathy to popular 57 understandings of the body and its modifications, reg ardless of class and cultural distinctions. Madero's clinical notes evidence how he and his patients regarded disease in humoral terms and used homeopathic manuals as remedy finders. But because of the symptomatic nature of homeopathic therapy, remedy find ing became a way by which homeopathy personalized therapeutic interventions as symptoms changed and gave material evidence to reassure patients' belief in their disease progress rather than increasing their concern about it. This connection between patient s' beliefs and practitioners' approach resulted in patients' choosing homeopaths rather than other physicians. Homeopaths a dapted their medical system to the cultural and economic liberal practices that characterized the Mexic an society in the second half of the nineteenth century. Homeopathy as a medical doctrine also fit the intellectual tastes and therapeutic needs of a stratified Mexican society. Such flexibility allowed homeopathy to penetrate different sections within the Mexican population and becom e one of the preferred therapeutic commodities of the people, whether by choice or by need. 58 Chapter 2. The \"Medical Reform\": Professional Organization, Medical Science, and Scientific Governance in the Formation of the Homeopathic Profession, 1869 -95 On July 15, 1893, President Porfirio D\u00edaz, Minister of the Interior, Manuel Romero Rubio, and the governor of the Federal District, General Pedro Rinc\u00f3n Gallardo, gathered in the gardens of El Polvor\u00edn \u2014 a military facility located in the southern outskirts of Mexico City originally intended to function as an asylum for patients with typhus \u2014 to inaugurate the National Homeopathic Hospital . Homeopathic doctors Ignacio M. Monta\u00f1o and Joaqu\u00edn Segura y Pesado talked to the audience about the origins and development of homeopathy in Mexi co during the last four decades and about the therapeutic principles on which ho meopathy was grounded. Finally Juan de Dios Peza, an acclaimed poet at the time, entertained those who attended the event. The journalist wrapped up his report with a note that praised the government for \"acknowledging homeopathy and opening the regular fi elds of battle to it.\"1 The creation and government sponsorship of the homeopathic hospital might appear surprising and against all odds, considering that homeopathy had been introduced as a medical commodity for domestic use and that academic physicians considered it a way to \"speculate\" with health. Yet the elements that made such an outcome possible are depicted in the inauguration itself. Rather than homeopathic entrepreneurs such as Comellas and Gonz\u00e1lez, academically trained doctors who endorsed home opathy were the ones responsible for running the new hospital. This signals an important change in the configuration of the homeopathic community, a change that better fit the effort to turn this group into a modern medical profession. Dr. Monta\u00f1o's discou rse precisely explained such a change, recognizing Comellas and Gonz\u00e1lez 1 \"El Hospital julio 17 1893. 59 as introducers and strong supporters of homeopathy yet emphasizing that the \"modern school was sustained by intelligent and practicing physicians\" .2 Homeopathic physicians gave homeopathy a different look to that given by their entrepreneurial counterparts. Rather than picturing it as a form of domestic medicine or as an unbeatable yet gentle therapeutic tool, physicians highlighted its positivistic nature. Dr. Segura y Pesado's discourse during the inauguration underlined the \"determinism\" on which the homeopathic me thodological approach was based and how \"experimentation and observation\" led homeopaths to characterize life and disease in terms of \"sensible phenomena\" or in other words \"facts\" .3 The parallel of this explanation to the Comtean positivistic philosophy is no coincidence. In a time when Gabino Barreda and other reformers used this philosophy as a tool to culturally transform Mexican society, homeopathic physicians ado pted it to advance their position as a professional group. Journalists regarded the hospital's creation as a way to solve epistemological and social disputes between the groups that contested homeopathy's legitimacy. The medical community was divided in i ts opinions about homeopathy. Within academically trained physicians, there were those who believed that homeopathy contradicted the foundations of medical science, but there were other group who considered that it either contradicted the foundations of me dical science, or lacked enough evidence to proof its workings. Within the community of homeopaths, academically trained physicians practiced homeopathy as a scientific therapy and a growing communit of lay homeopathic practitioners profited from selling h omeopathic manuals and medicines, offered homeopathy as a form of domestic medicina, or both. For a government that aimed to rule under the most advanced scientific dictums to achieve economic progress, such as 2 \"La inauguraci\u00f3n del Hospital Homeop\u00e1tico,\" del Hospital Homeop\u00e1tico.\" 60 D\u00edaz's, this dispute could only be solved in equal conditions that warranted fair competition. Clinical outcomes of state hospitals decided on homeopathy's effectiveness which in turn influenced D\u00edaz's government in regularizing and funding a homeopathic school that aimed to solve the problem of home opathic charlatanism. Consequently, t he creation of the homeopathic hospital positioned homeopathic physicians' practice and institutions vis-\u00e0-vis th e ones of the regular medical profession . In this chapter I will analyze the construction of the homeopat hic profession in Mexico during the second half of the 19th century. I will follow the structure suggested in the previous paragraphs to show that by adopting homeopathy, some academic physicians introduced it into the dynamics of medical professionalizati on in Mexico City. Such introduction meant that in order to cope with medical regulations and professional unifying tendencies, homeopathic physicians recognized state medical schools such as the National School of Medicine and the Superior Board of Health as centers of professional authority in matters of medical training and licensing. Furthermore, these physicians adopted the rhetoric of positivistic science to position homeopathy as a scientific therapy over other therapies. In turn, homeopathic physici ans regarded entrepreneurial approaches to and the liberal practice of homeopathy as unprofessional and separated their activities and institutions from those who endorsed them. Eventually, the division of the homeopathic community paid off in terms of pro fessional recognition. A government that sought to modernize the nation through education and science such as Porfirio D\u00edaz's saw the opportunity to train a growing population of homeopathic practitioners in modern scientific homeopathic therapeutics using the properly trained homeopathic physicians in a homeopathic hospital and school funded by the federal state. A \"medical reform\" turned the \"medicine for the people\" into a medical profession. 61 The medical profession in the first half of the 19th century in Mexico When Comellas introduced homeopathy to the Mexican people around midcentury (see Chapter 1), academic physicians had just taken the first steps to turn medicine into a modern profession. The reforms of President and also physician Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas in 1833 turned colonial medical institutions (whose regulating control l ay in the Spanish crown and the Catholic Church ) into liberal ones, regulated by civilian laws .4 But with the disputes between federalists and republicans before 1850 and betwee n liberals and conservatives from 1850 to 1870, there were few spaces for institutional construction during almost four decades. The School of Medical Sciences took turns with the National and Pontificate University of Mexico to train physicians during thi s hectic period, until the former turned into the Escuela Nacional de Medicina [National School of Medicine] in 1854. The school retained this designation for the rest of the century, indicating a definite emancipation from the control of the Catholic Church. The Superior Board of Health started to control medical practice in 1833 by creating a medical registry, a list of physicians whom the Board authorized to practice in Mexico City. The authority of the board did not go beyond Mexico City and consequently these regulations were not always followed, let alone implemented, by local juntas sanitarias [sanitary boards] . Something similar happened with the medical degree obtained at the medical school, for while social elites relied on it as a symbol of status, people consumed health services from a vast population of untrained and unlic ensed practitioners. The practical absence of trained physicians and their distribution in the national territory contributed to a poor professional organization. Indian towns relied on traditional healers or 4 See Jose \u00c1lvarez Am\u00e9zquita, Miguel E. Bustamante and Francisco Fern\u00e1ndez del Castillo, Historia de la salubridad y de la asistencia en Mexico , vol. I, 2 vols. (Mexico, D.

Mexico City had the largest concentration of licensed practitioners \u2014 including physicians, surgeons, pharmacists , and phlebotomists \u2014 in contrast to the countryside, yet illegal practitioners outnu mbered regular practitioners. For instance, only 17 out of 37 physicians that the census of Mexico City 1811 -12 registered were included in the medical registry of the city (about 1.81 per 10,000 inhabitants) .7 Though statistics are taken from a limited nu mber of districts, they indicate an overall tendency in the nature of medical providers available to Mexico City's population at the beginning of the wars of independence. It is possible, then, to speculate that even in urban centers such as this, medical care from academic physicians was scant. Perhaps it was even more dramatic. Though academic physicians were obliged by law to provide medical consultations at specific hours of the day for free to the poor, they mostly offered their services to wealthy eli tes. Things slightly 5 Most of the local medical traditions relied on herbal remedies, thou gh explanations of disease etiologies and therapeutic effects were deeply influenced by their religious understanding of the natural world and human nature.

The Mexican state already funded medical training at the National School of Medicine ,13 and expropriated hospitals from the Catholic Church were 8 84 surgeons, 26 pharmacists, and 20 phlebotomists.

There were also 17 surgeons, 49 pharmacists, 12 dentists, 7 phlebotomians and 14 midwives. 10 See Salda\u00f1a and Azuela, \"De en el siglo XIX.\" 11 Such as the Academy of Medicine, Anatomy and Pharmacy of the state of Puebla, created in 1802 and still functioning in 1824; in 1825, Jos\u00e9 Rui z, an army surgeon organized the Academy of Surgery in Mexico City; the Medical Society of the Federal District of the Mexican United States was created in the early 1830s; and the Mexican Academy of Medicine, which grouped the faculty of the School of Med ical Sciences in 1836 and published the journal Peri\u00f3dico de la Academia de Medicina en M\u00e9gico , which lasted seven years. 12 It emerged as a branch of the French Commission for Science, Literature and Arts in 1864, an effort of Napole\u00f3n III that aimed to ga ther knowledge from Mexico in order to foster bilateral economic growth between France and Mexico. In 1865, this branch separated from the commission and became the Medical Society of Mexico, and started to publish the medical journal, Gaceta M\u00e9dica de M\u00e9x ico, which is still the Academy's official publication. In 1873, this medical society was renamed as the National Academy of Medicine. Though other versions trace the academy's origin to a society created on November 30, 1851. Its journals were Peri\u00f3dico d e la Academia de de la Loza was the founding member and president of this society. Gabino Barreda was the secretary.

See also Carrillo, \"Profesiones sanitarias y lucha de poderes en \"La en Porfiriato,\" de de Filosof\u00eda y 64 starting to work as welfare institutions that took care of the poor's health needs and as center s for medical students' clinical practices .14 Some of the graduates from the school of medicine were able to secure positions either in medical or other government institutions and most of them had a private practice. But during the second half of the 19th century, the competition between the growing population of trained physicians in Mexico City and the abundant population of irregular practitioners made the former seek state support15 and start a discrediting campaign to rule out other healing practices .16 The homeopathic community organized as a professional group amidst this transition, adopting and adapting the strategies followed by academic physicians, eventually keeping homeopathy as a distinct medical profession. Homeopath's \"Reforma M\u00e9dica\": From D omestic Healers and Medical Entrepreneurs to Homeopathic Physicians Just like their academic counterparts, homeopaths populated the urban landscape, particularly amidst wealthy families, and their entrepreneurial activities targeted at least initially an audience well positioned in socioeconomic and geographic terms. Both were trying to find a social and professional place in the new structures that the modern nation was struggling to build up. Academic physicians sought in state institutions the support th ey needed to consolidate as a professional group, while homeopaths found the space to consolidate in the emergent liberal marketplace. As I have analyzed in the previous chapter, Ram\u00f3n Comellas and other homeopaths popularized the use of homeopathy amidst Mexican elites. Consumers of homeopathy eventually Letras, Direcci\u00f3n General de Asuntos del Personal Acad\u00e9mico, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico, 2005). 14 Members of the Academy believed that it was the role of the state to provide health services to the poor. See for instance Ana Mar\u00eda Carrillo, \"M\u00e9dicos del M\u00e9xico Dynamis 22 (2002): 353 -57. 15 For a larger discussion about the relationship between Mexican physicians and the state see Carrillo, \"M\u00e9dicos del M\u00e9xico decimon\u00f3nico: entre el control estatal y onom\u00eda 16 See for instance, \"Profesiones el Porfiriato.\" 65 became homeopathic practitioners or entrepreneurs who used it as a means to commercialize homeopathic products, medicines, and services, as in Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez's case, or to procure medical relief to their closer ones, as in Madero's case. This approach helped homeopaths to enlarge their networks with several lay practitioners, some entrepreneurs, and a few physicians and pharmacists .17 By the late 1850s there were around thirteen homeopaths practicing in Mexico City contrasted to 169 allopaths (Table 2) . Ram\u00f3n Comellas and other homeopaths also followed the trend their academic peers were pursuing and started to organize the reduced group of homeopathic practitioners into professional societies. The first ho meopathic societies created in the mid -19th century were ephemeral .18 They needed more than enthusiasm to endure and funding the activities and journals of these societies was an essential need that homeopathic practitioners could not afford. Eventually, a patron came from one of Comella's patients, Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez. The role of Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez as a medical \u2014 but most importantly homeopathic \u2014 entrepreneur was central for the sponsorship of the first enduring homeopathic societies in Mexico City. In the previ ous chapter 17 Joaqu\u00edn Salas and the pharmac ist Nicol\u00e1s Tinoco y also turned to homeopathic practice by Comellas. Comellas also gathered a small group of people to discuss the new system where he probably met Rafael Degollado, a physician who practiced at Hospital San Pedro y San Pablo and who turned to practice of homeopathy as well in 1861.Other networks of homeopaths not initiated by Ram\u00f3n Comellas started to populate the Mexican medical landscape of the 1850s. Rafael Navarrete, a Cuban physician, arrived in Mexico City in 1853. One y ear later, Jos\u00e9 Carb\u00f3, a Catalonian homeopath who arrived in Veracruz, treated successfully forty cases of yellow fever in that city, and just like Comellas, he received the authorization from President Santa Ana to practice homeopathy in Mexico. By 1857, Carb\u00f3 offered homeopathic medicines and medical advice in his own homeopathic dispensary in Mexico City. Narciso Sanchiz arrived in Mexico City in 1855. He is responsible of the conversion of Alfredo Dom\u00ednguez Ugalde and Pablo Fuentes y Herrera. Pascual B ielsa, and brothers Jos\u00e9 and Jaime Puig y Monmany arrived in Mexico City in 1856. Both brothers would start practicing homeopathy in the mid - 1860s after Sanfeliu, a Spanish immigrant who arrived in 1865, converted them to the new system. Homeopathy attract ed members of Catholic institutions, such as the Dominican friar Manuel Aguas and the Presbyterian Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3mez de Le\u00f3n who both started to practice homeopathy in 1857. 18 Ram\u00f3n Comellas founded the first homeopathic society in altogether pharma cists Nicol\u00e1s Tinoco y Mijares. Pascual Rafael Navarrete and Manuel Aguas, a network of homeopaths independent from Comellas, formed the Sociedad Homeop\u00e1tica de M\u00e9xico in 1861. This society published the medical journal La Gaceta . Both societies lasted no longer than a year. 66 we saw how homeopathic dispensaries and pharmacies started to populate the landscape of Mexico City during the last years of the 1860s, and how particularly Gonz\u00e1lez used homeopathy to expand his own business . He likely pursued the sponsorship and promotion of professional homeopathic societies in order to rule out his competitors .19 It was his and not others' homeopathic entrepreneurial approaches that were the target of critiques from academic physicians in the early 1870s, suggesting not only the profitability of the connection between entrepreneurship and professional societies, but the discomfort this produced amongst academic physicians. Through Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez's sponsorship, homeopaths organized IHM] in 1869, the first enduring homeopathic society. The building where Gonz\u00e1lez's dispensary was established provided the IHM with a room for the society's meetings and a consulting office where Institute's members provided free he alth services and medicines. Gonz\u00e1lez paid for the publication of El Propagador Homep\u00e1tico , the academic journal of the recently created institute .20 The new society gathered sixteen homeopaths, both physicians and practitioners, including the sponsor .21 This homeopathic institute appeared at the same time that the Medical Society of Mexico was forming, and consequently these two medical societies emerged as two competing medical 19 His dispensary is mentioned in connection with his support to homeopathy and the IHM; see \"Consultas m\u00e9dicas,\" El ferrocarril Martes 16 de noviembre 1869. 20 For the activities that Gonz\u00e1lez sponsored see the first numbers of El propagador homeop\u00e1tico. For his sponsorship of the consulting office and the homeopathic journal see the newspaper ads published in El Siglo Diez y Nueve and reprinted in Cuevas, Juan Pablo de los R\u00edos, and A. Salas. See Alberto G. Bianchi, \"La homeopat\u00eda de M\u00e9xico,\" 1875,\" La reforma m\u00e9dica 1.12 (1875). 67 institutions .22 The recently formed Society promoted French medical science, while the Institute aimed to study and promote homeopathic medicine .23 The Institute proposed to discuss homeopathic controversies, to print a scientific journal, to open a free medical dispensar y for the poor, to create theoretical and clinical classes, and to grant prizes to promote research. The Society sponsored the same activities as the Institute, but having the National School of Medicine and state hospitals as centers of professional train ing, the Society had no need to establish classes and a medical dispensary. In contrast, the Institute not only sponsored such activities, but granted medical \"diplomas\" to some of the members which in turn used them to comply with regulations of medical p ractice that the Board of Health imposed .24 This situation turned the homeopathic institute into a professional society that competed not only with the Society, but with the National School Medicine as a center of medical training and consequently of profes sional control. The academic and homeopathic community discussed this conflict in terms of the institutions that could legally grant medical degrees. For instance, in his article El m\u00e9dico en la sociedad , Jos\u00e9 Galindo accused Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez for disguisin profiting interests in the shade of \"medical altruism\" and for using the possession of a title which was not issued by the National School of Medicine to turn medical practice into medical business . For Jos\u00e9 Galindo, \"the professional liberty that th e Constitution [of 1857] granted did not intend to turn professions into 22 See Fernandez del Castillo, Historia de la Academia Nacional de Medicina de M\u00e9xico .; and Guarner, P\u00e9rez Herrera, \"REGLAMENTO del homeop\u00e1tico 1.6 (1871). 24 Juli\u00e1n Gon z\u00e1lez's dispensary was prosecuted by the Superior Sanitary Board in 1871. People who lacked a legal professional degree were banned from taking responsibility of pharmacies. Gonz\u00e1lez eventually was able to retain the control of his dispensary, but through negotiations with the President and not for possessing a medical degree. For a detailed account of this event see chapter 5. 68 a means of robbery\", openly referring to Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez and his pharmacy.25 Galindo's critiques are an example of how academic physicians regarded the provision of medical training an d degrees within homeopathic societies .26 Particularly, Galindo could not conceive the idea that people like Gonz\u00e1lez, who did not pursue proper medical training at the National School of Medicine where contemporary breakthroughs in surgery, obstetrics, and anatomic and physiological pathology were taught, obtained a medical degree from a homeopathic society and presented themselves as true physicians. Such critiques and a new wave of government regulations that aimed to use medical degrees issued by state medical schools as the basis of legal medical practice impacted the organization of the homeopathic institute and the composition of its members in the early 1870s. Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez's pharmacy was caught amidst this wave of regulations. At the center of Gonz\u00e1lez's conflict with the Federal District's government and the Superior Board of Health was his lack of a legal medical degree .27 He d idn't have a degree from the National School of Medicine, yet he held a diploma from the homeopathic institute .28 With this diploma, he aimed to comply with regulations that the Sanitary Board imposed on people who owned and ran pharmacies in Mexico City. Furthermore, he used the diploma and his influence within the 25 Jos\u00e9 Galindo, as Pascual Bielsa, who also had a homeopathic pharmacy and who possessed a legal medical degree, did not face at least in the beginning the vicissitudes that Gonz\u00e1lez suffered. For a detailed account of Bielsa's case see chapte r 5. 28 He is not included in the medical registry of 1871; see \"Lista de los Distrito Federal\" in AHSS, SP, EM, 3, 61. He recognized that the Institute granted him a diploma. See Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1le z, \"Literatura m\u00e9dica y homeopat\u00eda,\" El propagador homeop\u00e1tico 2.1 (1874). 69 Institute to change the Institute's regulations and attain ke y positions in the Institute's Directive Board that originally only physicians with a regular medical degree could hold .29 Galindo's critiques, government institutions ' actions against Gonz\u00e1lez, and the latter's reaction to the interventions of the Superior Board of Health motivated diverse responses from the homeopathic community that mimicked the same distinction that academic physicians wanted to use to separate from homeopathic practitioners. For instance, Galindo's critiques generated different responses from homeopathic practitioners and physicians members of the IHM. Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez replied that a scientific society's diploma granted its holder the authority to promote that specific society's growth .30 Homeopathic physicians differed from this p osition and argued that homeopaths indeed needed an adequate medical training. Therefore they suggested turning homeopathy into a legal practice by incorporating classes of homeopathy into medical schools, as already happened in other parts of the world .31 While not directly critiquing Gonz\u00e1lez's situation, homeopathic physicians were clear about their position regarding legal training and practice. Gonz\u00e1lez's self -promotion within the Institute motivated resignations from 29 In 1869, Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez was elected treasurer of the IHM Board. His new position within the Institute's government structure was possible only through a change in the Institute' s internal regulations, which for that year allowed that along with those physicians authorized to legally practice medicine, \"those who obtained a certification from the institute that they had taken and passed examinations on all classes that integrated the academic curricula of medical school\" could become first class members and occupy positions in the Board. See \"La junta The new regulation was approved on March 6, 1871, just two days before Gonz\u00e1lez's dispensary faced difficulties with the Superior Board of Health due to the dubious origin of Gonz\u00e1lez's medical degree. The Board approved the new regulation of the IHM on th at date; see P\u00e9rez Ortiz and Fuentes y Herrera, \"REGLAMENTO del Homeop\u00e1tico Mexicano.\" 30 See Gonz\u00e1lez, \"Literatura m\u00e9dica y homeopat\u00eda.\" 31 The editors of the IHM's journal, Francisco P\u00e9rez y Ortiz, Pablo Fuentes Herrera, Jos\u00e9 Tranquilino Hidalgo Pablo physicians' perspective on Jos\u00e9 Galindo's Fuentes Hidalgo De los R\u00edos, El propagador homeop\u00e1tico II.7 (1873). 70 members possessed legal degrees and licenses, such as Jos\u00e9 Puig y Monmany, editor of the Institute's journal at the time, and Pascual Bielsa .32 As Bielsa's and Puig y Monmany's departure from the institute show, Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez's professional status and the nature of the IHM as an inst itution that granted medical degrees produced tensions and divisions amongst institute's members. Such divide distinguished between two factions within the homeopathic community, homeopathic physicians and homeopathic practitioners, a divide that mimicked how academic physicians distinguished themselves from other healing practices , homeopathy included , in their effort to constitute a professional group. Homeopathic physicians were willing to be considered as members of the nascent medical profession to the extent that they abided by the criteria imposed by sanitary authorities and medical elites as to what constituted a legal physician . Moreover, homeopathic physicians adopted the marginalizing discourse with which academic physicians addressed homeopathy a nd its practitioners and used it against homeopaths who practiced on the margins of regular medicine . As a consequence, homeopathic physicians promoted a division within the IHM. Why would members of the IHM who were also regular physicians be dubious abo ut homeopath's training, if they were the ones who modified the institute's regulation that authorized the organization of training courses and the granting of diplomas in the first place? Homeopathic physicians realized that the strategy to diffuse homeop athy initiated by Comellas in the 1850s was out of fashion and that if they wanted to push homeopathy forward in Mexico in the 1870s, it would not be enough to reproduce the social organization of academic physicians. 32 Report given in an extraordinary reunion on April 9, 1871; see P\u00e9rez Ortiz, \"Discurso pronunciado por el se\u00f1or vicepresidente del Instituto.\" For the list of authorized physicians of the Superior Sanitary B oard see \"Lista de el Distrito Federal\", AHSS, SP, EM, 3, 61. 71 They needed to recognize the regulatio ns that ruled the professional life of physicians .33 On the contrary, homeopathic practitioners argued that their right to practice homeopathy was granted in the liberal Constitution of 1857 which gave them \" the right to teach without any restriction that what might be appropriate [to them]; for where the law does not forbid, no one is allowed to proscribe\" .34 These fundamental professional divisions eventually materialized in a reform to the Institute's internal regulations in 1875 that left all homeopaths who did not have a regular medical degree out of the institutions. The IHM remained integrated by both professional and lay homeopaths from 1870 to 1874, and its Board continued to be integrated by graduates of the National School of Medicine who endorsed homeopathy, or practitioners certified by the IHM, such as Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez. In 1875, homeopathic physicians reformed the Institute to include only those with a legal medical degree . In the new journal of the Institute, La Reforma M\u00e9dica [The Medical Refor m], the Board clarified that the new regulation had two objectives : first, to constitute the Institute as a scientific society that gave voice to homeopathy within the medical profession and attracted more physicians w ith a legal degree to its ranks, and s econd , to avoid crit iques to the Institute for \"granting the degree of profesores [professionals], without any right to do so, to people who , without any consider ation of how learned or wise they were , had not adequately and legally provided proof of their medical knowledge.\"35 Through this action, the Institute complie d with professional regulations and aimed to gain the acceptance of other homeopathic physicians, 33 For such a position see the opinion of Jos\u00e9 Alberto Salinas y Rivera, who became member of the IHM in 1875, in Jos\u00e9 Salinas y Rivera, \"REMITIDO,\" La Iberia S\u00e1bado 14 de agosto 1875. 34 The newly created Medical -Homeopathic Mexican Society presented its arguments in \"REMITIDO,\" La Iberia Martes 24 Mexicana,\" El o \"Advertencia,\" La reforma m\u00e9dica (1875): 3 -incorporation of Jos\u00e9 Puig y Monmany into the institute and incorporation of new members, all of them regular physicians .36 Nevertheless, the professional image of homeopathy was not repaired , and the Institute was not accepted as a professional medical society in Mexico City during the 1870s. Medical societies such as the Natio nal Academy of Medicine, the Pedro Escobedo Medical Association, and the Larrey Association stopped exchanging their journals with the IHM, at least during the first years of the decade .37 Any public support of homeopathy by professors within the National School of Medicine caused heated reactions from homeopaths, students in the National School of Medicine , and the public press .38 36 Other important doctors in the other urban centers in Mexico who integrated to the new Institute were Francisco Marchena (Puebla), Jos\u00e9 Alberto Salinas y (Yautepec, 1879). See the quired for new memebers Francisco Marchena, \"Un medicina y cirug\u00eda Dr. D. Jos\u00e9 Alberto Salinas y Rivera, En cumplimiento de la fracci\u00f3n La reforma m\u00e9dica I.8 (1875). There is a list of members in J. Alberto Salinas y Rivera, \"Doctor D'Haucourt, m\u00e9dico home\u00f3pata, Miembro M\u00e9dica de XI.5 (marzo 1) (1876). Later on, when the academy's attitude towards homeopathy turned more receptive, it started to exchange the IHM's journal; see the Acts of the academic sessions on January 16, 1878, February 20, 1878 and June 5, 1878, in Gaceta M\u00e9dica de M\u00e9xico XIV.14 (July 15, 1879). Later on the academy would even exchange foreign homeopathic journals, for instance in 1881 it started receiving Archivos de Medicina Homeop\u00e1tica from Barcelona, Spain; \"ACADEMIA M\u00e9xico XVI.7 (abril 1) (1881): 25. 38 Such as in the case of Adri\u00e1n Segura, a professor of pathology who in catedra requested his students to experiment with highly diluted doses. The national press either pr aised Dr. Segura as a defender of homeopathy or as a traitor to scientific medicine, depending on the position that the newspaper took in this conflict. Juan Pablo de los R\u00edos, a journalist and ardent homeopathic practitioner, praised Adri\u00e1n Segura as a de fender of homeopathy, in Juan Pablo de los R\u00edos, \"Una carta del Dr. 25 de abril 1877. Some newspapers from M\u00e9xico City, such as El Combate, La Patria, and La Orquesta , published commentaries in the same terms as Juan Pablo de los R\u00edos, and even one of them suggested Segura's resignation from his position of Professor of Pathology at the National School of Medicine. But Adri\u00e1n Segura addressed the National Academy of 73 Regardless of blocking the IHM's incorporation into the professional life of medical societies in Mexico City, the IHM's strateg y of professionalization paid off in other parts of the country, gaining spaces where they could legally offer homeopathic training. Homeopathic physicians obtained teaching positions at the School of Medicine of Puebla in 187839 and opened spaces for clini cal practice in th at city and in Veracruz in 1879 .40 That year, Puebla's new law of public instruction regulated medical education, incorporating homeopathy as a medical degree, independent from that of regular medicine, and organizing the academic curricul a for the homeopathic degree .41 Governor Luis Mier y Teran regularized homeopathic in Veracruz in 1880 Hence, the \"medical reform\" carried out by the homeopathic institute Medicine justifying his action. He explained that he was not a homeopath and that he made a favor to homeopaths in believing in the accuracy of the homeopathic doctrine and in attempting experiments to see if homeopathic theories were true. See \"REMITIDO,\" El siglo diez and gained the position of physiology and higiene , and anatomy, respectively. See (11 de febrero) (1878). 40 Luis M. Zaragoza held the position of Professor of Homeopathic Therapeutics and was in charge of the Clinic of Homeopathy in the General Hospital in Puebla. Dr. Ismael Talavera promoted the opening of two wards, one for men with 17 beds and one for women with 8 beds, destined to homeopathic treatment in the Hospital \"La Llave\" in Orizaba, Veracruz. See \"Inauguraci\u00f3n de dos of homeopat hy had to attend almost the same courses as allopaths, except Mineralogy and Geology, Pharmacy, Anatomic Pathology, and History of Medicine, which would be substituted by Clinic of internal homeopathic medicine, and Allopathic and Homeopathic Therapeutics; homeopathic students had to perform \"reasoned homeopathic experiences\". The courses that allopaths needed to course were Botany, Zoology, Mineralogy and Geology, Chemistry, Chemical Analysis, Anatomy, Histology, Topographical Anatomy, Anatomical Path ology, Pharmacy, Physiology, Internal Pathology, External Pathology, Clinic of Internal Medicine, Clinic of External Medicine, Pathology of Infants, General Pathology, Surgery, Therapeutics, Hygiene, Obstetrics, Clinic of Obstetrics, Legal Medicine and Toxicology, and History of Medicine and Surgery. Even pharmacists needed to course homeopathic pharmacy as part of their professional training. See Francisco de As\u00eds Flores y Troncoso, \"Ense\u00f1anza de la medicina Fomento, 1886) 204 -06. 42 In order to become a legal homeopathic practitioner in this state, homeopaths needed to certify that they had studie d medicine as required by contemporary laws. Besides this requirement, they needed to pass examinations on \"I. Applied botany with a special emphasis on the geography of medicinal plants of the country. II. Reasoned exposition of the Hahnemannian medical d octrine. III. Homeopathic therapeutics. 74 allowed homeopathic physicians to institutionalize homeopathy within official medical institutions in some states, but not in Mexico City. The position taken by the reformed IHM in 1875 reconfigured the path to becom ing a professional homeopath. An aspir ing homeopathic physician needed to study medicine at any of the offici ally recognized medical schools, then learn homeopathy by reading homeopathic books or practicing along with a homeopathic physician or practitioner, and finally obtain a homeopathic degree from the state of Veracruz. Otherwise that person needed to study homeopathy in the School of Medicine of Puebla. Homeopathic practitioners believed that they did not need to go through this entire pathway to become homeopaths, and consequently when the IHM was reformed in 1875, they formed a homeopathic society of their own in 1874, the Sociedad M\u00e9dico -Homeop\u00e1tica Mexicana [Medical -Homeopathic Mexican Society]. The Directive Board of this new society was integrated by practitioners who were not included in the list of authorized physicians issued by the Superior Board of Health in 1871. The society published an academic journal, El faro homeop\u00e1tico and opened a consulting office, just as the reformed IHM did. But in contrast to the latter, the society of homeopathic practitioners opened a school to train new homeopaths .43 Homeopathic practitioners were not able to secure any authorization by government or academic institutions, as opposed to their professional peers . 44 IV. Homeopathic clinics.\" The decree detailed the procedures for such examinations and clarified that while there were no professional homeopaths with title in Veracruz, the government would integrate the examining c ommittee with three professors of surgery and medicine who were members of the IHM. See the decree no. 105 in \"CR\u00d3NICA DE LA HOMEOPAT\u00cdA. Reconocimiento y protecci\u00f3n de For instance, Jos\u00e9 Salinas y Rivera was able to obtain a position of physician in a local prison, and Crescencio Col\u00edn participated in the oppositions for a position in one of the welfare hospitals in Mex ico City; see note in J. Alberto Salinas y Rivera, \"CR\u00d3NICA de las oposiciones para proveer las plazas (15 de marzo) (1877). Following the example of the first homeopaths in Mexico, this homeopathic society sought to obtain authorization to practice homeopathy directly from local authorities. On July 1878, Manuel Vald\u00e9s y Morelos, the Society's 75 During the 1870s, homeopaths sought to incorporate the ir activities into the ordered \u2014 or in other words , legal \u2014 national life. Both homeopathic physicians and practitioners detached from homeopathic entrepreneurial activities. Neither of the reformed professional societies, for instance, included Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez amongst its members. Yet the community of ph ysicians, homeopathic ones included, located the medical degree issued by the National School of Medicine as the junction that kept the profession together and that regulated officia l medical institutions . During this period, physicians whether homeopaths or not reacted against any attempt to disrupt such central unif ication . On the opposite side, practitioners unsuccessfully sought a venue to be accepted as regular physicians. If homeopathy was a therapeutic system that healed people even in the hands of t hose who did not have a legal medical degree, its practice could not be illegal, practitioners argued. This appreciation of homeopaths' clinical successes started a battle of credibility among homeopathic practitioners, homeopathic physicians, members of t he National Academy of Medicine, pharmacists, and students and graduates from the National School of Medicine. These battles aimed to promote or discredit homeopathy, sublimate or derogate it, make it appear as either common or scientific knowledge, or use its tenets as a heuristic tool to find new medicines. Positivism, Medical Science, and the Plurality of Scientific Homeopathic Therapeutics The construction of homeopathy as the opposite of scientific positivistic medicine, a practice of ignorant people, a heuristic pharmacological tool, the true scientific therapeutic method, or a miracle cure mirrored at small scale larger socio -economic, political , and cultural changes in Mexican society during the second half of the 19th century. Homeopathy was not president, requested auth orization for him and all the members of the academic society he represented to issue death certificates, but with no success. To see a detail account of this event see chapter 5; \"CR\u00d3NICA (1878). 76 intrinsically alternative or heterodox in nature to medical science, and the multiple contemporary depictions of it say more about the socio -political context within which the framers of such depictions lived in than about the ontology of homeopathy itself .45 During the 1870s, while homeopaths organized into professional societies following the example of other medical societies of the time, and while the discussion about the value of an official medical degree for a professional practice and inclusion in offic ial life was taking place, there was a discussion about the epistemological status of homeopathy and the epistemological value of the clinical facts to which homeopaths turned to validate homeopathy's effectiveness. These discussions took place only after homeopathy established a wide public practice in Mexico City, but most importantly when positivistic science became a tool of social reconstruction. The process of the professionalization of medicine \u2014 and homeopathy \u2014 in Mexico came at a time of peace tha t promised economic and cultural progress in Mexico .46 After Benito Ju\u00e1rez finally defeated his competitors to make the liberal Constitution of 1857 prevail, he established a government that gave the nati on a sense of stability (1867 -72). With his victory came along necessary regulations to implement the Constitution ; new civilian and penal codes that ruled in the Federal District and other federal territories were issued and soon other states followed this example. What I have just described as the reorgani zation of homeopathic societies so they would only accept physicians with legal medical degrees was just but one example of such tendency. But stability would not be achieved only through legal and institutional transformations. An ideological transformat ion was also necessary. The importance of positivism for the consolidation of the triumphant liberalism lies precisely in that it was used as a reconciliatory 45 For an elaboration of this idea see Cooter, \"Alternative Medicine, Alternative Cosmology.\" 46 For a general assessment of this period see Lira and Staples, \"Del desastre a la reconstrucci\u00f3n republicana, 1848 -1876.\" 77 ideology that promised social reconstruction .47 When Gabino Barreda publicly read his Oraci\u00f3n C\u00edvica [Civic preach] in 1867, he proposed to create a new ordered and progressive nation by teaching Mexican children how to think methodologically. Inductive science was to be the foundation of any empirical knowledge, keeping theology, metaphysics and philo sophical speculation apart, and brin ging the nation into a superior \u2014 positive, in Comtean words \u2014 stage. Such a pedagogical approach permeated the Mexican society in the following decades, thanks to Barreda's efforts as Minister of Instruction to create t he National Preparatory School, where students willing to pursue professional education absorbed Comtean positivism. For him , new generations needed a structured mentality in order to promote progress. They needed to learn from particular facts to general laws, from what is concrete to what is abstract, through observation and experimentation, gathering positive facts from experience. Science, modernity , and progress were intertwined, and eventually materialized in projects that improved social and material conditions of the most important urban center in the nation, Mexico City .48 Barreda started promoting his positivistic ideology within the medical sciences even before his Oraci\u00f3n c\u00edvica and more importantly in the context of a critique of homeopathy. In 1861, he published appraisal about this new means to deceive na\u00efve people] .49 47 See Hale, The Transformation of Liberalism in Late Nineteenth -Century Mexico . Natalia Priego discusses how what constitutes science, positivistic philosophy and scientificism in the second half of the 19th century in the introduction of her book Natalia Priego, Ciencia, historia 2009). P. 28 -42. 48 For an example of how such ideologies transformed sanitary politics from the preindependent period to the Porfiriato, as well as the construction of the Grand Canal see Agostoni, Monuments of Progress: Modernization and Public Health in Mexico City, 1876 -1910 . 49 It was originally written in 1861 and then it was reprinted in 1877, when the Sociedad Metod\u00f3fila Gabino Barreda presented his work as the first one where Barreda presented the positivist method as \"the only guide for the intelligence to investigate truth\" and to deduct \"precise 1877) i. 78 This work was so influential that throughout the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century it would guide academic physicians' appraisal of homeopathy, as in the case of Galindo's critiques .50 Barreda's concern with homeopathy was that it diffused medical knowledge among the general public, an audi ence that was not properly educated to judge medical matters. He recognized that professional physicians knew about homeopathy; they had an obligation to do so since that was their profession. But since midcentury, the wide diffusion of homeopathy in the M exican population generated comparisons between homeopathy and \"common medicine\" amidst untrained people. Barreda considered that \"the people\" who talked about homeopathy lacked rational data to judge the new medical system because they were \"ignorant\" abo ut medicine in the first place. Barreda believed that each one had to decide on the wellbeing of himself and his family, but as the leading man of positivism in Mexico that he would become in the next years, he believed that it was necessary to \"il lustrat e\" people so they could m ake more informed decisions. Once he took this step, the tone of his book turned into a denunciation of ignorance. He believed that \"there was no other way to effectively combat charlatanism, but with the diffusion of lights\" .51 As in the Oraci\u00f3n c\u00edvica , Barreda placed science and its diffusion through education as the one and only solution that would truly and thoroughly eliminate what he called the hydra, referring to charlatanism. He put charlatanism, ignorance, and \"vague and incomplete notions\" in one single box, and contrasted them with truth and education. For the positivist , the diffusion of homeopathy among the Mexican public was a consequence of its ignorance, and the only way to 50 Barreda's critique of homeopathy went through several reprints with a different name in M\u00e9dica reprinted it in several numbers of the volume 7 in 1904. Finally, it was printed in 1934 as a monograph, by \"Acci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica\", the medical journal of the Sindicato de M\u00e9dicos Cir ujanos del Distrito Federal [Union Federal District]. 51 Barreda, \"Op\u00fasculos, discusiones y discursos,\" 1 -2. 79 stop ignorance \u2014 or the diffusion of homeo pathy, in that case \u2014 was through education. The rest of the pamphlet was precisely that, an instruction o n how to think about homeopathy in terms of a charlatanry that deceived illiterate and untrained people . In the early 1870s, the decade academic physi cians started using Barreda's rhetoric and methodology. In order to discredit dispensaries', patients' , and practitioners' accounts about surprising and unexpected results achieved with homeopathy, academic physicians used \"experience\", the ultimate tool t o decide epistemic conflicts according to Auguste Comte's positive methodology, without noticing that experience was also at stake. While for homeopaths experience referred to the clinical outcomes of those patients who had been treated with homeopathic me dications ,52 academic physicians referred to how to understand disease and its causes in the body. A critique of homeopathy in 1871 read The philosophical thinking of our time is pure observation. Bodies at the reach of our hands and conditions where chang es in these bodies take place: That is science. There is no place in it for anything that has not been seen and touched. May anyone who believes in this [science] pay attention to animism, dynamism, vitalism and other preconceived hypothesis? Back up react ionary homeopathy! Hail to the school of Paris!53 This understanding drew a boundary between professional and amateur practice of medicine. Only those who had access to positivistic science \u2014 in other words, those with a privileged access to professional medical training \u2014 could grasp such an understanding of medical science and practice. These medical elites discredited all other forms of medical knowledge , particularly 52 It was homeopathic practitioners who most commonly used this argument, though previous homeopathic physicians such as Ra m\u00f3n Comellas and Jos\u00e9 Carb\u00f3 obtained authorizations to practice homeopathy on the grounds their success in epidemic outbreaks using homeopathy. In the 1870s the Mexican Medical -Homeopathic Society would recurrently used this argument. Alberto G. Bianchi wa s the one who particularly responded to homeopathic critiques, arguing that homeopathy proved more effective in hospital statistics; see Alberto G. Bianchi, \"Al \"Progreso\",\" El Ferrocarril Mi\u00e9rcoles 21 de junio 1871. 53 Alberto G. Bianchi was responding to the critique published in El Progreso ; see \"Al Ferrocarril,\" El Ferrocarril Martes 30 de 1871. proposed by curanderos , midwives, homeopaths, and nostrum sellers, practitioners who academic physicians labeled as charlatans. In the logic of academic physicians , these charlatans were guilty of malpractice due to their lack of scientific knowledge .54 Even the Gaceta M\u00e9dica de M\u00e9xico , the National Academy's of Medicine's journal, which originally did not intend to side on any medical discussion in 1865 ,55 started to publish critiques of homeopathic practice and therapeutics after homeopathic physicians professionalized the homeopathic institute in 1871. These critiques were not as cent ered on homeopathy as a medical system as Jos\u00e9 Galindo's; rather they were reflections on clinical cases that included negative comments about homeopathy. Yet these comments pinpointed similar critical issues for academic physicians regarding homeopathic p ractice, such as homeopath's lack of medical and surgical knowledge, the practice of homeopathy just for profit, and the absence of any medical substance in homeopathic globules. Demetrio Mej\u00eda and Juan Fenelon were the most eager critics of homeopathic pr actice and therapeutics in the 1870s in the Gaceta .56 Mej\u00eda catalogued homeopaths amongst charlatans and included its therapeutic successes within those cases where the patient healed due to the natural course of disease or in the absence of any therapeutic intervention .57 Homeopathy to him was simply no therapeutics at all. If homeopaths coincided 54 Claudia Agostoni describes this boundary as the logic behind the distinction between scientific physicians and ileg al physicians; see Agostoni, de M\u00e9xico I-II.1 (15 de septiembre) (1864). 56 I analyzed one of Fenelon's critiques in chapter 1. There was another one where he detailed all the anatomical findings he made in a newborn who had developed liquid inside his skull, and all therapeutic interventions Fenelon did to reduce the baby's brain swelling. Fenelon guided the reader to what he believed was the single anatomical cause of the child's death, the contusion of the head. It did not matter that the immediate cause of death was diarrhea and that the physician mentioned in his report that the baby's family lived in extremely unhy gienic conditions, Juan Fenelon accused a homeopath for \"having used forceps without septiembre) (1864): 317. 57 As Fenelon's critiques, lack of knowledge or unsounding basis of homeopathy were the reasons why Demetrio Mej\u00eda labeled homeopaths as cause of death or useless for healing or at least palliation. See 81 with other physicians' diagnosis and advised surgery, Fenelon accused them for not sustaining their faith in homeopathy or for a dapting their practice to the socioeconomic status of the patient; \"the profit was not worth the risk of wasting patient's time, as they are used to do\", he said .58 Fenelon did not agree with the idea that the cause of a particular disease would be the specific treatment for that same disease \u2014 in other words the idea of simila similibus curantur , likes cure the like \u2014 and he provided anatomical examples, as when he criticized tracheotomy to remove an object from a patient's trachea . According to him, tracheotomy w as a surgical practice worth of a homeopath, for it was \"adding a strange body to an intolerant organ which already had a strange body within it.\"59 Homeopathic physicians saw the need of the homeopathic community to catch up with the cultural demands impos ed by positivism and medical science. They realized that by continuing to emphasiz e the ability of every person to learn homeopathy, they weakened homeopaths' ability to be recognized as legitimate medical practitioners. No matter their ties to the regular medical profession, by popularizing homeopathy as the medicine for the people homeopaths built an image of popular medicine that conflicted with their professional aspirations. For this reason, they internalized the scientific rhetoric and incorporated it into their professional community, reshaping their own discourse. Homeopaths turned homeopathy into a scientific therapeutic system, based on clinical observations and facts, rather than anecdotes of miraculous healings. Homeopathic physicians, hence, pic tured homeopathy \"Fractura mayo Presidencia del M\u00e9dica de de agosto) (1877): 301. 82 reform\", one that systematized empirical observations about the therapeutic effects of different remedies into a scientific system. The \"medical reform\" was truly positivistic therapeutics for them. The reformation of the hom eopathic institute in 1875 not only kept professional credentials as a membership requirement, but also introduced a discursive shift in the way homeopathic physicians diffused homeopathy. Homeopathic practitioners responded to Jos\u00e9 Galindo's critiques by opposing homeopathy to pathologic anatomy and traditional therapeutics. For instance, Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez argued that allopaths \u2014 for him, those who practiced the \"official school's\" therapeutics \u2014 were not able to localize pneumonia in a single organ, and tha t even assuming this specific localization , their therapies harmed other organs, reducing the body's natural self -recovery tendencies such when they used blood -letting , or producing new diseases such as when they used surgery . He blamed these methods as \"h ypothesis and nothing else; theories lacking any foundations; respect for a systematic and fanciful tradition; no experimentation; these are the great resources of the traditional school\". And he continued, Is it proper to dismiss fair observations [refer ring to those made by homeopathic practitioners], persisting in doing harm, cultivating the mistake, and turning into strong advocate s of doctrines that are far from being scientific? This is where allopaths dwell and yet they call us assassins and charlat ans.60 Graduates of the National School of Medicine who adopted homeopathy and joined to the IHM subscribed to the thesis that homeopathy was scientific therapeutics, yet they were not oppos ed to the traditional therapeutics offered by \"the official school\". In response to Jos\u00e9 Galindo's critiques of homeopathy, the reformed IHM argued that the scientific locus of homeopathy was its notion of pure experimentation and its foundational law of sim ilitude, the similia similibus curantur . It was only through this law that therapeutics became scientific, the 60 Gonz\u00e1lez, \"La homeopat\u00eda,\" 239. 83 editors of the IHM's journal argued .61 This position allowed them to be less dogmatic about the principles of homeopathy, which consequently made them more cautious about the general applicability of the homeopathic law and some of its implications .62 For instance, Jos\u00e9 Alberto Salinas y Rivera believed that homeopathy supplemented \"official therapeutics\" and consequently believed that homeopathy was more a therapeutic method than a medical system .63 According to him, allopathy lacked the individualization of each patient's disease impli cit in the homeopathic approach; consequently homeopathy demanded more detailed clinical observations contrasted to t he clinical practice taught by allopaths. Rigorous clinical observation and rigorous pharmaceutical experimentation \u2014 in other words , detailed application of the principles of pure experimentation and the law of similitude \u2014 made homeopathy a positive scie nce in Salinas y Rivera's analysis. There were some divergences amongst homeopathic physicians. While Salinas y Rivera believed that the exact coincidence of the patient's individual symptoms with the specific symptoms produced by a particular homeopathic remedy determined the homeopathic doctor's prescription, Francisco Marchena, another graduate of the National School of Medicine who joined the IHM in 1875, believed that the election of the right medication should be based on the patient's general sympto ms.64 Both agreed that it was necessary to use infinitesimal or highly 61 Francisco P\u00e9rez Ortiz and Tranquilinio Hidalgo, both registered in the Superior Board of Health were the editors of the journal of the IHM. They suscribed this opini\u00f3n in an editorial article Similibus Curantur,\" El propagador homeop\u00e1tico III.1-2 Other graduates from this school such as Crescencio Col\u00edn persistently sustained homeopathy's exceptionality, aligning with the dogmatic rhetoric of homeopathic practitioners; see below in this chapter. For the position of the professional society founded by homeopathic practitioners see \"Nueva cruzada,\" El faro homeop\u00e1tico (1874). Salinas EN Memoria presentada al cirug\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Alberto Ri En de la 4a. del art. Reglamento..\" and I.12 (1875). 84 diluted doses, yet they believed that it was necessary to experiment with concentrated doses both to understand the physiological effect of those medical substances and to use concentrat ions that corresponded to the strength of the disease in each specific case. When homeopathy became less radical in the hands of homeopathic physicians, members of the Academy started to experiment with it. Adri\u00e1n Segura , professor of Pathology at the National School of Medicine , carried out some experiments with homeopathy and even prompted his students to test the infinitesimal doses of this therapeutic system in 1877 . His pioneering position regarding homeopathy is evid ence of a generational shift regarding therapeutics within the Academy. Instead of relying on what previous physicians, scholars or textbooks said about specific therapeutic approaches, what at the time was called empirical therapeutics, he proposed to act ually carry out experiments to se e if those approaches worked in clinical practice. When Segura addressed the Academy, he emphasized that he only asked students to \"personally learn from the field of what is experimental\", as he had done it for \"three years without reaching a definite opinion about homeopathy\".65 He was clear about his disbelief in the theoretical foundations of homeopathy, yet he acknowledged that its law was recommended in clinical practice for it had proved to have good results. Regardles s of public denunciations that with no success demanded him to resign from his position at the school of medicine, Segura continued experimenting with homeopathy and acknowledging its contributions to the national pharmacopeia.66 By the first half of the 18 80s, Adri\u00e1n Segura was 65 Segura, \"CR\u00d3NICA Segura.\" 1882, he continued prescribing treatments recommended by homeopaths in the Hospital Ju\u00e1rez and reporting his successful results to the Gaceta; see \"ACADEMIA DE MEDICINA. Extracto del acta de la sesi\u00f3n del 16 de noviembre de 1881. Acta no. 7 aprobada el 20 de Gaceta M\u00e9dica de M\u00e9xico XVII.1 (1 de enero) (1882): 10. He acknowledged tha t homeopaths introduced the use of phosphorous for the treatment of homeopathy, and that the medicine sulphur was effective against diphtheria because of its homeopathicity. He argued that this substance produced the ulcerations similar to those caused by the disease itself. For his report on phosphorus see \"ACADEMIA DE MEDICINA. Sesi\u00f3n del 1o de mayo de 85 not neutral about homeopathy as other authors in the Gaceta , he was positive about the importance of homeopathic contributions in both new drugs to treat disease and theoretical explanations of the physiological effect of such drugs. Moreover, he was confident to discuss it with members of the Academy, which suggests a more open attitude of the Academy to introduce homeopathy in their discussion of clinical cases. After twenty years of critiques, members of the National Academy of Med icine started to acknowledge the therapeutic value of homeopathy, even in the hands of those who were \"outcasts\" of professional or academic medicine .67 This attitude shift also permeated the National School of Medicine, where students evolved from trying to explain \"the parallel between rational medicine and homeopathy\", as the title of Facundo Ramos y Ramos' 1872 dissertation read, to evaluate \"what type of healing method should homeopathy adopt, dosimetry or allopathy?\", as Arturo Palmero Alcocer's 1895 dissertation title asked .68 Students from the early 1870s were not the same of those of the 1880s. Chemistry started to have an academic space in the school of medicine. With the educational reforms of 1867, the new academic 1882. Acta num. 22, del de M\u00e9xico XVII.5 (1 de mayo) (1882): 135. For his comment about the homeopathicity of sulphur s ee Adri\u00e1n Segura, M\u00e9xico XIX.22 (15 de noviembre) (1884): 526. 67 For instance, notes that reported the death of important homeopaths shifted f rom clearly stating that the Academy did not endorse homeopathy to simply clarifying that while being legal professionals these homeopaths were not part of the Academy. When Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Puig y Monmany died in 1877 the Gaceta M\u00e9dica de M\u00e9xico openly stated that \"professors of the academy did not endorse such a system.\" When the journal announced that Francisco P\u00e9rez Ortiz had passed away in 1884, the note only mentioned that he was a homeopath. When Crescencio Col\u00edn died in 1889, the journal on ly clarified that he was not member of the Academy. See \"Necrolog\u00eda,\" Gaceta M\u00e9dica de M\u00e9xico XII.4 de mayo) ( 1889). 68 Facundo Ramos y Ramos was a doctor from Spain. He probably wrote this dissertation to fulfill the requirement to practice medicine in Mexico. The title dissertation clearly explained its content and suggested its conclusions -that the homeopathic approach did some contributions to medicine, though it also carried some problems with it.

Rather th ey considered it as part of the therapies available for any physician, and being trained in chemistry, they were concerned about the doses it used. Chemistry provided new tools for pharmacists and physicians to understand the structure of old drugs and med ical formulations. It also provided new insights for thinking about homeopathy. Chemically oriented physicians and pharmacists' appreciations of homeopathy were not monolithic. On one side were those who believed, like the pharmacist Francisco Pati\u00f1o, that mathematical and chemical analysis provided evidence that homeopathic dilutions did not contain any trace of medical substance .70 Adri\u00e1n de Garay, a medical student in 1881 , followed all the instructions included in Hahnemann's Organon to prepare a homeopa thic medication and then subjected himself to the homeopathic regime of foods and beverages .71 He finally ingested the medication without experiencing any of the effects attributed to the specific substance he was 69 See Francisco de As\u00eds Flores y Troncoso, \"Establecimiento 1919),\" Dynamis 27 (2007): 276 -78. 70 What prompted Francisco Pati\u00f1o to start a discussion about homeopathy was an article by Lic. Hilario S. Gavilondo in the newspaper La Rep\u00fablica where he placed homeopaths as an example of the liberty of professions that Mexicans enjoyed in the early 1880s; see Francisco Pati\u00f1o, \"La libertad de profesiones,\" La independencia m\u00e9dica I.36 (1881). The motivation to start the discussion suggests, as I have emphasized, that scientific discussions about homeopathy were rooted in the dispute for more patients as the marketplace became more competitive in the last quarter of the 19th century. For his critiques of homeopathic dilutions see Francisco Pati\u00f1o, \"La 71 de the journal La Escuela Medicina, peri\u00f3dico dedicado a las ciencias m\u00e9dicas from 1879 to 1914. He graduated of medicine in 1887. Around 1910, he was professor of Topographic Anatomy in the ENM. For his critique to homeopathy see Adri\u00e1n de Garay, \"La doctrina ged Crescencio Col\u00edn, the homeopath with whom they were having a discussion about the content of homeopathic doses, to a public experiment, a situation that Colin rejected because he believed that Pati\u00f1o and De Garay missed the fundamental points of homeop athy and homeopathic pure experimentation .72 This discussion about actual effectiveness with highly diluted doses continued throughout the rest of the 19th century .73 On the other side were those pharmacologists interested in finding either new medical subst ances or new applications for already known medicines. Fernando Altamirano, one of the most important pharmacists in the last quarter of the 19th century who dedicated his life to investigate the medical properties of the national flora and fauna and who w ould played a key role in the research program initiated at the Natio nal Medical Institute, an institution created 72 When the \"Sociedad Metodofila Gabino Barreda\" and authors -both pharmacists and physicians - of the recently created journal La Independencia M\u00e9dica critiqued homeopathy, Crescencio Col\u00edn was the single homeopathic physician who debated with them. In these debates, Col\u00edn pointed out that his adversaries missed the point of the law of similitude and pure experimentation, and that doses were not essential to the discussion of what homeopathicity was and how it worked. But as discussions progressed and his adversaries demanded experimental proof that diluted doses had a physiological effect in the human body, Col\u00edn responses turned dogmatic, emphasizing that homeopathy was the single therapeutic method that was scientific, and that there was no other method, wh ether chemical, physiological, used in animals or diseased humans but the homeopathic one that proofed the effect of homeopathic medicines. Col\u00edn was not willing to accept partial proofs of homeopathy's effectiveness and he demanded a neutral public space for such experiments. The society was created in 1877. Between 1877 and 1878, the journal reprinted Gabino Barreda's critique of homeopathy and another critique by Daniel Mu\u00f1oz, one of Barreda's disciples. Daniel Mu\u00f1oz D\u00edaz de Le\u00f3n, 1907) 111 -2. According to Col\u00edn, the author was doctrin a de Hahnemann refutada por el Sr. Col\u00edn.\" 73 The discussion would continue during the late 1880s and the 1890s with Fernando Malanco and Maximino R\u00edo de la Loza. For Loza's position see below. Physicians that formerly argued against homeopathy such as Juan Fenelon continued to oppose homeopathy. He did not even acknowledge the value of homeopathy when his peer membe rs of the academy, physicians and pharmacologists, started to acknowledge the value of homeopathy at the bedside and in pharmacological research in the mid -1880s. (1888): 25 and 28. 88 during the Porfiriato solely for this purpose , was aware of the substances used by homeopaths .74 His contribution to the Academy suggests that homeopath s' frequent use of poison ivy motivated him to look for the plant's pharmacological properties and promote its use among members of the Academy. In the review of animal -produced poisonous substances presented by Jes\u00fas S\u00e1nchez to the Academy in 18 92, he commented that homeopaths used a large diversity of animal poisons as medicines and concluded by quoting a famous French treatise of therapeutics; \"the homeopathic doctrine has created a pure materia medica from which all kinds of invaluable notions about the special properties of medicines and about a multitude of particularities about their action which were not know amongst us are taken\" .75 Pharmacologist s' interest in finding new therapeutic substances ma de them less concerned about homeopathic concentrations and more interested in the homeopathic pharmacopoeia and its applications. Homeopathy was nothing like a marginal practice in Mexico City at the end of the 19th century. The intellectual environment o f the last quarter of the 19th century favorably positioned homeopathy as a scientific therapeutic system that competed with others that were in vogue at the time. From domestic medicine practiced by patients who lacked any technical training in medicine i n the 1850s, homeopathy had become a therapeutic system worth considering by trained physicians and pharmacologists. The widespread use of this therapy amongst not only patients but also scholars, whether physicians, veterinarians, and pharmacists, made it a sought - 74 When he reviewed national plants that had irritant properties in 1880 for the Gaceta , he recognized that homeopaths were the ones who most frequently used poison ivy [ mala mujer ]. Moreover, this plant was the same one that Madero sent to Ignacio Fern\u00e1ndez de Lara to research its homeopathic properties. See Fernando (15 de diciembre) (1880): 510. 75 The authors of this Treatise of Therapeutics were Trousseau and Pidoux, authors to which homeopaths constantly referred to in their discussions with academic physicians to proof that the latter's peers had already experimented with homeopat hy and found (1 diciembre) (1892): 403, 04, 10. 89 after medical treatment, an alternative for patients with difficult diseases, and a research tool to investigate other uses of already known remedies or the therapeutic properties in new ones, i.e. alkaloids. Regardless of the recognition of the therapeutic contributions of homeopathy and its value as a tool to investigate the pharmaceutical properties of chemical substances, physicians were not willing to consider homeopathy either as a distinct profession or as part of \"the true medicine\". In ot her words, in a map of 19th century medical knowledge, academic physicians and professional pharmacists located homeopathy on the periphery as an accessory tool with which they could gain knowledge about new therapeutic substances. This chart of medical kn owledge was a mirror image of the professional space that homeopaths occupied in the last quarter of the 19th century. Just a few graduates from the National School of Medicine practiced homeopathy and organized into professional societies. They were criti cal about some approaches of what they called \"traditional\" medicine at the medical school, but they had no influence to promote a change. Moreover, even geographically, the homeopathic school in Puebla and regulated medical degrees in Veracruz were not lo cated in the epicenter of modernity that Mexico City was at the end of the 19th century. Unable to find a more central position in academic discussions, within the National School of Medicine, and in other medical institutions, homeopathic physicians resu med former strategies to diffuse homeopathy, particularly the provision of medical training and free health services. The conjunction of these strategies with a scientific rhetoric helped homeopaths to convince Porfirio D\u00edaz and his minister of the interio r to support a homeopathic hospital where clinical results decided homeopathy's therapeutic efficacy. As I will show in the next section, this was achieved thanks to the context that homeopaths themselves had created : a reconfigured 90 homeopathic community integrated now by both professional physicians who possessed knowledge of medical science and entrepreneurial practitioners who needed to be trained in medicine, and the public acceptance of homeopathy as a scientific therapy. Porfirio D\u00edaz's Scientific Gov ernance and the Creation of the National Homeopathic Hospital In 1884, Porfirio D\u00edaz was elected President of Mexico. His thirty -years -long dictatorship transformed M\u00e9xico from a politically divided and economically devastated nation into one where \"order and progress\", as his political campaign boasted, dominated. Following the advice of Los Cient\u00edficos [The Scientists], a group of elite politicians and men of profound influence , most of who m grew up in Mexico City adopting Barreda's positivist philosophy, Mexico City became the epitome of an ordered and progressive city, particularly in term s of the medical sciences. As Mexican historian Claudia Agostoni shows, D\u00edaz's government sought to transform the nation's capital into a cleaner and healthier city .76 This interest manifested in the creation of institutions that aimed to promote pharmaceut ical, microbiological, and pathological research77. Such interest also extended to new therapies that promised to treat epidemic diseases, including 76 See her Agostoni, Monuments of Progress: Modernization and Public Health in Mexico City, 1876 - 1910 . 77 The institutes were the Instituto M\u00e9dico Nacional , the Instituto Bacteriol\u00f3gtico Nacional , and the Instituto Patol\u00f3gico Nacional , respectively. For an overview of these institutes see Priego, Ciencia, historia 78-107. For a detailed history of the Instituto M\u00e9dico Nacional see Nina Hinke and Laura Chazaro Garc\u00eda, El Instituto M\u00e9dico Nacional. La pol\u00edtica de las los Instituto Nacional, 2012). ; Nina Hinke, de una histo del Instituto M\u00e9dico Fisher, de Neurociencias XVI.Supl 1 (2011). 91 homeopathy ,78 and which eventually translated into the creation of the National Homeopathic Hospital and the National School of Homeopathic Medicine. The hospital and the school were not originally conceived by Porfirio D\u00edaz, his ministers, or his advisors. They resulted from homeopathic physicians' demands. They took advantage of several trends in D\u00edaz's govern ment: the need for regulation of professions through the creation of state -funded professional schools; the status of homeopathy as a modern scientific therapy in need for an ultimate experiment to certify its effectiveness; and the government's need to co pe with the high rates of mortality in Mexico City \u2014 one of the clearest indicators of the lack of progress in Mexico \u2014 which translated into the provision of health services through welfare institutions. D\u00edaz's creation of homeopathic institutions and, he nce, his regulation of the homeopathic profession in Mexico took the form of a social experiment, one which both homeopathic practitioners and physicians had been requesting . In order to try the efficacy of homeopathy as a therapeutic tool, he first author ized the creation of the homeopathic hospital; and after receiving favorable results, he decided to authorize the creation of the homeopathic school. In the 1880s, homeopathic institutions suffered a new transformation that put homeopathic physicians and practitioners back together again, reviving homeopaths' arguments about the liberal practice of homeopathy. In spite of the Mexican Homeopathic Institute's reorganization in 1875 and the recognition of homeopathy's contributions to medical science, it was not able to gain public spaces for the study and practice of homeopathy in Mexico City in the 1880s. The IHM's inability to enroll more physicians made its members to seek support from 78 For instance, in 1887, the Diario Oficial de la Naci\u00f3n published the homeopathic treatment for cholera because it proved to be more effective than regular therapies. Correspondence that Manuel Romero Rubio, Minister of the Interior, addresses to the Superior Board of Health; se e \"MUY IMPORTANTE. affluent homeopathic practitioners as they had done it two decades befo re in order to keep the homeopathic community alive in 1886 .79 The new IHM endorsed the same strategies to diffuse homeopathy that it practiced before its division in 1875, particularly the provision of medical training and free medical services. In 1888, J oaqu\u00edn Segura y Pesado, a recent convert to homeopathy, one of the founding members of the new IHM, and a graduate from the National School of Medicine in 1877, opened a medical academy as part of the IHM efforts to propagate homeopathy. He believed that a homeopathic school was necessary for \"it was better to train educated professors who would brilliantly represent and willingly diffuse Hahnemann's science, than to expect the fortuitous adoption of it by physicians.\"80 The new generation of homeopathic physicians realized that the dreams of a previous generation to become part of the medical profession by acknowledging official institutions as centers of pr ofessional control did not work and that they needed to create their own means to make the homeopathic profession grow and endure, based on the professional liberties that the Constitution granted. 79 The IHM grouped around 15 homeopaths in 1869. By 1873, it had approximately 30 members. The reformed IHM was left with only five homeopathic physicians in 1875. A rough calculation suggests that initially, the society that grouped homeopathic practitioner s had at least five times more members than the IHM. Only a 10 physicians adopted homeopathy and became members of the IHM from 1875 to 1880. During the 1880s, the IHM lost institutional presence and Crescencio Col\u00edn remained as the single homeopathic phys icians who debated with other physicians who critiqued homeopathy. In 1885, he reorganized former members from both homeopathic societies into a single one; the C\u00edrculo Homeop\u00e1tico Mexicano changed its name to IHM one year later, for the law of Veracruz re cognized members of this institution la homeopat\u00eda en M\u00e9xico . For the new society, the distinction between physician and practitioner was no longer an obstacle to share an institutional life, as Juan N. Arriaga, a member of the new society and homeopathic practitioner, put it \"there is no way one can require from tho se who practice [homeopathy] to have a title provided by our authorities, and one must rely on the ones issued by foreign institutions or by the corporation that represents [this] medical system in our country\". See La reforma m\u00e9dica. Segunda \u00e9poca II.7 (1 887). The new institution incorporated a larger number of both former and new homeopaths than previous societies; there were 52 members distributed in 20 cities in 1887. P\u00e1nfilo Carranza, \"El Hospital Homeop\u00e1tico.\" 93 The provision of free medical services was also a key element that distinguished the practice of physicians from that of practitioners. Members of the Academy b elieved it was the role of the state to provide health services to the poor .81 The reformed IHM found it difficult to establish free medical services after 1875, due to the lack of Gonzalez's sponsorship. Originally, its members needed to provide funds for the institute's new dispensary and their own medicines; patients in turn needed to pay medical consultation .82 In 1878, the institute opened the Casa de Beneficencia Mexicana [Mexican Welfare House] to provide free public medical consultations and medicines , but it was closed a few months later because sponsors sold the property .83 Members of the institute tried to open homeopathic hospitals that did not have any connection with the IHM, but with no success .84 In 1888, the institute that put homeopathic physicians and practitioners back together again opened its dispensary as a means to \"increase the public awareness of such a therapeutic system, to provide evidence of its clinical successes, and to fulfill phy sicians' duty as charitable men\" .85 Ignacio Fern\u00e1ndez de Lara, a recent graduate of the National School of Medicine took charge of the new dispensary. Once again, the duality of the homeopathic community both as legal physicians and irregular practitioners raised voices that clamored for regulation. In a lecture given at the 81 See for instance Carrillo, \"M\u00e9dicos del M\u00e9xico decimon\u00f3nico: entre el control estatal y la autonom\u00eda profesional,\" 353-57. 82 Arts. 3, 4 and 5 of the new \"REGLAMENTO,\" La reforma m\u00e9dica Monmany, an honorary member of the IHM, attempted to open a homeopathic hospital for which he required permission to the city's government. The Superior Board of Health to whom the case was turned responded that a homeopathic hospita l could be set to work if it complied with the hygienic requirements for a hospital, but the commission considered that Puig's hospital did not fulfill the requirements of ventilation and consequently denied the authorization to Jose Puig. See AHSS, SP, P, S, 4, 34; and the Superior Board of Health commission's evaluation in AHSS, SP, P, S, 5, 6. 85 Carranza, \"El Instituto gratuito Medicine 1887, Maximino R\u00edo de la Loza, a famous pharmacist ,86 proposed to solve the problem of homeopathic charlatanism by both incorporating homeopathy into allo pathy and teaching homeopathic classes in the National School of Medicine .87 He believed that by eliminating the dogmatism in both systems, disputes would end and every practitioner would find room to use any system for specific cases in their clinical prac tice. Moreover, he acknowledged that the only way to stop the diffusion of homeopathy as a domestic medicine and the demand of homeopathic \"healers\" by patients in Mexico City was for the National Academy of Medicine to promote the study of homeopathy in t he National School of Medicine. Only in that way, would homeopathic patients seek treatment with trained physicians rather than charlatans, he concluded. Francisco de As\u00eds Flores y Troncoso regarded homeopathy and the training of homeopaths in a similar f ashion. He welcomed the training of homeopaths in the school of medicine of Puebla .88 He even considered that through this approach the medical school of Puebla surpassed the ENM. But he also criticized the regulation in Veracruz, for it provided medical de grees without even having a medical school. In Flores's opinion, regulation could 86 Son of Leopoldo R\u00edo de la Loza. As his father, he played an important role in the institutionalization of chemistry, pharmacy and pharmacology in Mexico, as researcher, inventor, president of the Pharmaceutical Society, and promoter of pharmacy as a profession independent from medicine during t he second half of the 19th century. See Liliana Schifter de la Sociedad Qu\u00edmica Mexicana 5.2-3 (2011). 87 He was confident that homeopa thy was not only useful to explain for instance new developed vaccines, but also to foresee the application of new discovered alkaloids, as he himself did it when he competed for a position of adjunct professor of chemistry in the ENM in 1861. Maximino R\u00edo (15 de agosto) (1887). In admission thesis, he studied the uses of the plant Senecio canicida where he explained how people used the plant to poison wolves and coyotes that lived in their villages, how extracted the alkaloid responsible for its effects, and how by using the law of similitude he deducted the medical uses of such substance. In clini cal experiments with dogs that received a specific dose of this acid, he found that all of them suffered from convulsion. He concluded that the new substance could be used to treat epilepsy. See Schifter Aceves, \"La de la identidad de la Qu\u00edmica Mexicana.\" 88 See Flores y de la medicina en el per\u00edodo positivo,\" 209. 95 only come through proper medical training. So while acknowledging that some trained physicians adopted homeopathy, he severely criti cized untrained people who practiced it. Moreover, when he analyzed homeopathy as a medical system, he acknowledged it as a valuable tool because of its idea to carry out experiments in healthy individuals and its law of similitude .89 For Flores y Troncoso, homeopaths needed to carry out further ex periments in order to demonstrate that highly diluted doses had clinical effects. For such reasons he believed that the homeopathic doctrine was \"worth as a subject of study and reasoning, even if it seemed singular and ineffective\". \"It was time \u2014 he conc luded \u2014 to judge it based only on the purest and most reasoned experimentation and provide a definite verdict\", about it as either \"a lie, or a true medical progress. \"90 The idea of carrying out an impartial experiment to test homeopathic doses drove medica l and pharmacological discussions in the early 1880s. But like many of Porfirio D\u00edaz's political and economic decisions during his dictatorship, his inclination for homeopathy was guided by his own personal and political interests, rather than the benefit of the nation. While the press reported the creation of the National Homeopathic Hospital as a welfare effort that would also help to settle down the disputes between allopaths and homeopaths, the idea to support homeopathy did not come from the group of p oliticians called los cientificos , among which figured members of the National School of Medicie who were opend detractors of homeopathy, such as Porfirio Parra, close disciple of Gabino Barreda. Rather Diaz's inclination to homeopathy came through Manuel Romero Rubio, his Minister of the Interior in the early 1890s and father -in-law. Romero Rubio's close relationship to one of the wealthiest families in Mexico, the Pesado family, and his inclination for homeopathy, facilitated Joaqu\u00edn Segura y Pesado 's 89 See his chapter Flores Troncoso, \"Terap\u00e9utica,\" 641 -9. 90 Flores y Troncoso, 96 access to the President.91 D\u00edaz suffe red from a bone infection that no physician had been able to treat successfully. When he learned about Joaqu\u00edn Segura y Pesado, he requested his services. Using homeopathy, Segura y Pesado was able to make D\u00edaz's wound heal in 10 days .92 Whether the story i s accurate or not, or if it only resembled clinical stories of success pictured by homeopathic practitioners, Segura y Pesado's family connection with the President allowed the homeopathic doctor to reach Porfirio D\u00edaz and obtain his support for homeopathy . When Segura y Pesado addressed the Minster of the Interior to request support to open the homeopathic hospital, he accommodated homeopathy into the trends I have described so far . He argued that \"those who subscribe [to the cause for the homeopathic hos pital] possess this title\", and \"consequently, we fulfill the requirements of the law to practice our profession.\" He believed that by establishing a hospital, the government would \"expose the excellence of homeopathic methods, contribute to solve the cala mities caused by epidemic diseases in Mexico City, [... and] indicate that the administrations look[ed] after the general good through public welfare.\" To substantiate his arguments, Segura y Pesado listed a series of statistics of European and US hospitals that showed the reduced mortality of patients treated with homeopathy during epidemic diseases. He only asked for material support and administrative staff to keep the facility working, for the medical staff would provide their services free of charge.93 91 Joaqu\u00edn Segura y Pesado was son of Guadalupe de and Vicente Segura y Arg\u00fcelles. Guadalupe Pesado de Segura was daughter of the first matrimony of Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn See Samuel un un c\u00famulo de picard\u00edas NY: Imprenta de R. Smith, 1889). 92 Porfirio D\u00edaz's daughter told this story. See Flores Toledo, Iniciaci\u00f3n a la homeopat\u00eda 317. 93 Letter where Joaqu\u00edn Segura y Pesado, Lara, andIgnacio Mar\u00eda Monta\u00f1o requested support to the Ministry of the Interior, Manuel Romero Rubio to use El Polvor\u00edn located in a state known as El Cuartelito to open the homeopathic hospital; June 26, 1883. AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 1, 1, 17 -21. 97 On July 1, 1893, Manuel Romero Rubio, Minister of the Interior, announced that Porfirio D\u00edaz had granted authorization to use El Polvor\u00edn for the homeopathic hospital .94 In a few days material resources and regulations were set, and the hospital started offer ing its services. The hospital was intended for poor patients with acute diseases who wanted to be treated by the homeopathic method. For patients with chronic diseases, the hospital hosted an outpatient clinic. The government paid for up to 60 patients in the hospital and 14 staff personnel. F our home opathic physicians \u2014 Joaqu\u00edn Segura Pesado, the hospital's head, de Lara, and Fernando G\u00f3mez Su\u00e1rez \u2014 offered their services, medicines, and medical and surgical instru mental free of charge, and medical personnel w ere subsequently incorporated from Joaqu\u00edn Segura y Pesado's homeopathic school .95 As the journalist from El Siglo diez y nuevo argued when he reported the inauguration of the hospital, the government had opened the fields of regular battle to homeopathy, setting up a clinical experiment to decide the effectiveness of homeopathy in the clinic, as well as a social experiment that would decide the future of the homeopathic profession. Medical statistics came out ev ery six months, showing the results of homeopathic intervention in acute diseases in the homeopathic hospital, and giving both homeopathic physicians and Porifirio D\u00edaz the arguments they needed to regulate the homeopathic profession. The hospital's staff and Porifirio D\u00edaz found the statistics outstanding. Mortality ranged between 8.01 and 12.8%, in contrast to, for instance, 33% in Hospital Ju\u00e1rez .96 The homeopathic 94 Correspondence from the Minister of the Interior to the Joaqu\u00edn Segura y Pesado and other homeopaths, AHSS, EH, HNH, 1, 1, 23 - 25. 95 Correspondence between the Welfare Office of the Minister of the Interior and Joaqu\u00edn Segura y Pesado, and \"Reglamento de l Hospital Homeop\u00e1tico\"; AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 1, 1, 26 -36 96 For the statistics of the homeopathic hospital see AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 1, 1 p. 53; 1, 3, p. 2 -3; see also Juan Antiga Escobar, Consideraciones acerca de las estad\u00edsticas del Hospital Nacional Homeop\u00e1tico (M\u00e9xico: Imp. de Trinidad S\u00e1nchez Santos, 1901) 11 -14.; an article published by El Partido Liberal reprinted in defensa de hospital's that Porfirio D\u00edaz found the statistics of allopathic hospitals in such a stark contrast to the homeopathic ones that he decided not to make the former publicly available . In the eyes of the President, homeopathy succeeded in the clinical facts. In a time of scientific governance, of the dictatorship of facts, homeopathy proved its superiority over other treatments and earned a place in the official institutions of modern Mexico at the end of the 19th century. Yet homeopaths still needed to regulate their professional situation. Professors of the existing homeopathic academy used the same argument that Barreda used to discredit homeopathy, but this time a dapting it to support their petition. They used the argument that the regulation of homeopathic medical training would end up with homeopathic charlatanism in order to convince President D\u00edaz to suppo rt a homeopathic medical school; after all, the homeopathic hospital had already prove the effectiveness of homeopathy and its status as a scientific practice. As homeopathic physicians did 20 years before to professionaliz e the IHM, this new generation argued that most homeopaths who practiced in Mexico were not trained physicians and that homeopathy was a \"legacy of charlatans\". \"Unemployed, ignorant, and misfortunate people, all of them open homeopathic consulting offices ; there is one on every street; even women open theirs and venture on with the beneficent science, greatly harming people and homeopathy itself,\" they maintained.97 Porfirio my already nourished the homeopathic hospital with homeopathic physicians, and that his school needed to provide \"all the scientific curriculum to its students in order to give plain certainties to patients who used this medical system and to preclude any abuses from practitioners who lacked any medical training and title\", Diaz decided to constitute the profession of m \u00e9dico cirujano home\u00f3pata [homeopathic medical 97 See \"Una defensa de la homeopat\u00eda,\" 351. 99 doctor] .98 On August 17, 1895, he issued the decree that created such a profession and that regulated Joaqu\u00edn Segura's academy. This document provided the foundatio ns of the academic curriculum for students of this new profession, which were similar to those provided by the ENM , plus dissection and homeopathic doctrine. Coursework done at the homeop athic academy was considered legal , and the academy itself was declared \"national\" ; in other words, the decree transformed Joaqu\u00edn Segura's academy into the state's professional school for homeopaths, Nacional de [National School of Homeopathic Medicine]. Properly trained homeopaths would no longer b e charlatans and would instead become authorized phy sicians.99 Conclusions The regularization of the homeopathic profession can be seen as a symbol of state policies during the Re stored Republic and the Porfiriato, rather than an actual form of regulating the medical profession. Starting in the 1870s, the Mexican government sought to organize state institutions into ordered structures that promoted Mexico's economic growth and the social and cultural modernization of its population. For this reason, the state's instructional system adopted positivism as a modernizing ideology, and, in the case of medicine, turned the National School of Medicine, the Superior Board of Health, the Nat ional Academy of Medicine, and welfare hospitals into centers that aimed to control, regulate, and unify the medical profession. Homeopaths' efforts to reorganize their professional associations to acknowledge these institutions as centers of professional authority in the 1870s and D\u00edaz's support to create and 98 See Porfiri o Diaz's Decree, August 10, 1895, that created the ENMH, in \"DECRETO,\" La homeopat\u00eda III.1 (1895): 3. 99 See a note published in El Universal on October 2, reprinted in \"La Escuela de Medicina Homeopatica cient\u00edfica VIII.22 (1895). 100 fund a homeopathic hospital and regulate a school of homeopathic medicine in the 1890s followed this trend. The way these modernizing efforts aimed to transform the nation, its institutions, and its population favored particular elite groups and marginalized the rest of the population. The construction of homeopathy as a distinct medical profession in Mexico during the second half of the 19th century is an example of such a tendency within the medical profession. Homeopaths who pushed for the professionalization of homeopathic professional societies and the creation of homeopathic hospitals and schools belonged to urban medical elites. Moreover, their network of acquaintances was closely associated wit h D\u00edaz's extended family, which also occupied key government positions. The status they had as graduates of the National School of Medicine and the scientific rhetoric they used to position homeopathy as a therapy worth discussing within academic circles w as the same as that used by the rest of the academic medical community to distance itself from unprofessional forms of medical practice and unscientific forms of medical knowledge. Homeopathic physicians, hence, discredited and marginalized other homeopathic knowledge and practices that they regarded as less scientific and professional. Yet, p hysicians and the government used the growth of the population of irregular medical practitioners as an argument to further state regulations. The presence and increasing growth of irregular practitioners' population motivated physicians, homeopathic ones included, to demand more comprehensive laws that attracted more state support to the medical profession, creating a loop that perpetuated the social stratification of all medical practitioners, whether professionals or not, allopaths or homeopaths. By obta ining D\u00edaz's government support, homeopathic physicians furthered the divide between regular and irregular medical practitioners in Mexico. If in the 1870s they supported it by acknowledging the status given by the possession 101 of a medical degree provided b y an official school and the use of a scientific rhetoric, in the 1890s they created an institutional distinction between homeopathic and allopathic medical doctors, and homeopathic and allopathic practitioners. Homeopathic physicians used those practition ers who could not have a place in professional homeopathic societies in the 1870s as a reason for the regulation of a homeopathic school that provided them adequate medical training. If the National Homeopathic Hospital and the National School of Homeopat hic Medicine were symbols of the regulatory unification that governments sought during the Restored Republic and the Porfiriato, at a narrower level they represented a true divide for the medical profession .100 But if there existed other types of practitione rs and therapies in the la st quarter of the 19th century, why did homeopathy in particular obtain Porfirio D\u00edaz's support? The answer lies in the nature of homeopathy as a medical system around which its practitioners found identity and the marginalizing a ttitude of academic physicians against it .101 Homeopathy was not an unorthodox group of medical beliefs in the second half of the 19th century, but by framing it as a distinct type of medical knowledge practiced by untrained people, academic physicians promp ted homeopaths' creation and organization of parallel medical institutions. Other groups such as midwives, while resisting control, eventually were assimilated and eliminated as a profession .102 Clergymen and traditional healers provided free healing service s and in the case of traditional medicine, had an alternative view of medicine, but they did not seek to organize into a 100 See a note published in El Globo on Septeber 28, reprinted in Quevedo y a ciencia?: La institucionalizacion de la homeopat\u00eda en M\u00e9xico.\" 101 For a discussion about how heterodox medical practices in the 19th century constituted themselves as such see Cooter, \"Alternative Medicine, Alternative Cosmology.\" 102 See una profesion. Las parteras tituladas en Mexico.\" 102 professional group .103 Therapies such as magnetism, hypnotism, dosimetric medicine, and traditional herbal remedies were simply that, the rapies, and their theoretical background either fit contemporary explanations of disease an d the body, or did not function as ideologies that socially organized and unified their practitioners. Homeopathy was a medical system that attracted urban elites a nd middle class population, and for this reason it did what other therapeutic or medical approaches could not. It worked as an ideology that grouped educated citizens who in turn used it as a means to criticize the elitist aspirations and monopolistic desi res of professional physicians. As in other countries where homeopaths organized into professional societies and created their own medical schools and hospitals ,104 in Mexico homeopathy gathered a group of practitioners, entrepreneurs, and physicians around a single ideology and professional corporate body. Unlike these countries, Mexican homeopathic physicians were unable to create major medical institutions, such as schools and hospitals, without the lack of sponsors , and even with them, homeopathic profess ional societies only provided some basic medical training and small dispensaries or consulting offices. Homeopathic physicians were able to raise homeopathy to the status of a scientific therapeutic approach, but they were not able to position it within th e curriculum of the National School of Medicine. In contrast to the United States, where homeopathic institutions thrived thanks to a regulatory model that minimized the regulatory intervention of the state in professional medicine in the 19th century, in Mexico the centralizing regulatory policies of the Porfiriato led to the allocat ion of state resources to support a homeopathic hospital and school. 103 Ana Mar\u00eda Carrillo places these three groups of practitioners -homeopaths, clergymen and traditional healers - as groups that were resistant to control. See Carrillo, \"M\u00e9d icos del M\u00e9xico decimon\u00f3nico: la autonom\u00eda profesional,\" 161 -5. 104 For the professional organization of homeopaths in England during the 19th century see Phillip A. Nicholls, Homoeopathy and the Medical Profession (London ; New York: Croom Helm, 1988). ; for the US case see Kaufman, Homeopathy in America; the Rise and Fall of a Medical Heresy . 103 Hence, the case of homeopathy in Mexico provides a good example for understand ing how strong state interven tion influenced the configuration of the Mexican medical profession in the 19th century. 104 Chapter 3. Scientific Medical Training for the Working Class: Homeopathic Medical Schools and the Centralization of Medical Education in Mexico City, 1895 -1940 In 1939, the newly created Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional [National Polytechnic Institute] distributed a booklet that explained the history, curriculum, institutional status, and reasons for the inclusion of the National School of Homeopathic Medicine (ENMH) as one of the Institutes's founding professional schools .1 The pamphlet argued that \"homeopathic medicine [...] proposed to solve a tough problem[,...] the provision of an efficient social service with a minimum cost to the human masses.\" Accor ding to the text, homeopathy's primacy in providing such a service was a consequence of its theoretical foundations and practices addressed specifically to \"the crowds of desheredados [disenfranchised]\", which the text identified with \"workers, campesinos [farmers,...]\" and those \"fighters of the socialist true\" who were still in their mothers' wombs.2 For this reason and aligni ng with the socialist emphasis on education proposed by President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, the ENMH gained a position amidst the professional schools intended to provide professional training to the working class. This rhetoric reproduced arguments used by homeopathic practitioners and physicians who had been trying to organize into a distinct professional group within the larger medical profes sion since the mid -nineteenth century. Addressing medical training and healing services for the working class granted homeopaths support from both the people and the state through the 20th century, in spite of National -School -of-Medicine (ENM) graduates' g eneral opposition. In institutional terms, this rhetoric helped them to receive Porfirio D\u00edaz's support to open a National Homeopathic Hospital (HNH) and the ENMH in 1893 and 1895; it helped homeop\u00e1tica thy of Mexico, hereon ELHM] to attract students and become the largest homeopathic medical school in Mexico in the 1920s and 30s; and it also helped to reinsta te the ENMH as a state medical school during the C\u00e1rdenas administration after the National Unive rsity dis solved it in 1925. The homeopathic medical system and professional schools thrived in the first half of the 20th century due to homeopaths' ability to align their training institutions with different governments' populist policies that aimed to br ing professional education to the working class. The way different homeopathic groups used the rhetoric of educating the working class intertwined with the state 's educational and administrative policies and the interests of the larger medical and local h omeopathic communities . The complex interplay between educating the working class, providing modern scientific medical training, and financing the complex facilities this type of training demanded led to the diversification of homeopathic schools in Mexico City. Furthermore, the institutional shifts that the two schools that emerged as a result of this process went through was also the result of a difficult social, political, cultural, and institutional process of institutionalization of the Revolution of 1 910 during the decade 1920 -30. The provision of medical training to the working class was not a simple issue in Mexico City either in the Porfiriato when social elites integrated the medical profession and enjoyed the favor of Porfirio D\u00edaz or after the re volution when military leaders contended for political power and struggled to create modern institutions that fulfilled the promises of the revolution. The revolution acquired different meanings for different homeopathic groups. While for ELHM founders it meant providing medical education to those who could not attend the ENM, for ENMH authorities it meant that the state provided the resources to improve medical training. While different administrations favored one or the other for various \u2014 mostly politica l rather than academic \u2014 106 reasons , eventually wha t made both institutions thrive was students' resistance to be ing coopted by top -down regulation of medical training. As I will analyze in thi s chapter, this divide influenced these homeopathic schools' positions within government institutions and state regulations, the financial support they received, the quality of their facilities, their academic curriculum structure s, and their student population structure s and graduation rate s. Eventually, the ENMH's model that reproduced the ENM's ended up in the former school's incorporation into the latter, leaving the model that addressed the working -class needs as the only one through which homeopathic medical training survived. Eventually , the interventionist state regulated in favor of academic -medical -curriculum uniformity and adequate teaching facilities. Yet its compromise to fulfill social demands \u2014 specially the provision o f training to the working class \u2014 led it to listen to homeopa ths and keep their schools alive . The doctrina ire struggles within the homeopathic profession, the push of university physicians to unify and standardize medical training, and the state's intervention in regulating medical schools interplayed to create a d iverse set of medical schools, including homeopathic ones, in Mexico City. The socio -economic and political diversity of actors and institutions made the unification of professional medical training a nuanced process that while giving uniformity to the med ical curriculum, also retained institutional diversity. The disputes between the groups that headed medical schools in Mexico City during the process of reconstruction after the armed phase of the Mexican Revolution raise questions about the role of a revo lutionary state in the configuration of the medical profession in Mexico. In other words, it provides an opportunity to 107 trace the specific \"political geographies\" in Mexico that decided over the \"science wars\" between homeopathy and the rest of the medical profession .3 This chapter analyzes the institutional history of homeopathic medical schools in Mexico City during the first four decades of the twentieth century. The politics of the creation, closure, and re -intallment of the ENMH as well as those that c reated and regulated the ELHM demonstrate how class, medical science, and the state intertwined to diversify medical education in Mexico City. I will follow a chronological sequence to compare and contrast how different state policies worked on the ground in homeopathic medical schools. The first section describes the professional politics that led to the creation of the ENMH, how these influenced the medical school's position in the Porfirian administration, and the consequences this position ha d regarding the quality of medical training offered at this school. The second section explains how the revolution introduced a new rhetoric that different groups within the homeopathic community used to either create a new homeopathic medical school, as in the case of the ELHM, or obtain state sup port, as the ENMH did. In the thi rd section, I analyze the role that state regulation and medical science played in the transformation of the ENMH into a medical specialty. I show how professional aspirations of ENMH graduat es aligned with the administrative centralization and ideological unification of ENM authorities and graduates, while the doctrinarian vision of homeopathy of ELHM students and faculty led them to oppose such tendencies and constitute a medical group and s chool that resisted state regulation and ideological imposition. 3 For the concept of b oundary formation, epistemological geographies and science wars see Thomas F. Gieryn, Cultural Boundaries of Science: Credibility on the Line (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999). 108 The \"bifurcation of science\" to prevent \"abuse\": The National School of Homeopathic Medicine and the politics of medical training marginalization, 1895 -1910 As I analyzed in chapter 2, a direct consequence of the success of homeopathic therapeutics as applied in the National Homeopathic Hospital was that Porfirio D\u00edaz regulated homeopathic medical training that was already being offered by homeopathic professional societies through the A cademy of Homeopathy.4 This academy was structured as a regular medical school. Some of its faculty members were ENM graduates, and the courses they taught were the same as the ones included in the ENM's academic curriculum (see Table 1). The academy offer ed courses such as anatomy, clinical practice, materia medica, pathology, hygiene, surgery, physiology, and pharmacology .5 With D\u00edaz's regulation, the hospital hosted the academy and became the ENMH. D\u00edaz's regulation compelled the n ew homeopathic school to include courses that \"embraced all the scientific knowledge that [was] required by law\", standardizing requirements for enrollment and academic curricula in all medical schools in Mexico City .6 Now all ENMH 4 Joaqu\u00edn Segura y Pesado, one of the homeopathic physicians who re quested the creation of the National Homeopathic Hospital, already headed an Academy of Homeopathy hosted by the homeopaths' professional society when the hospital opened. See Salinas Ramos, Luis. S\u00edntesis para la historia general de la medicina en M\u00e9xi co. Revista MH. N\u00famero 34. 1984, cited in Francois Flores, Historia de la homeopat\u00eda en M\u00e9xico 32. 5 Segura's Academy of Homeopathy offered a curriculum not as developed as the one offered at the School of Medicine of Puebla, let alone the ENM, but still a curriculum that gave homeopathic practitioners or any person who wanted to learn homeopathy basic m edical training in the early 1890s. Dr. Segura y Pesado was the head and also taught anatomy; Dr. Bernab\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez was secretary; Dr. Ignacio Fern\u00e1ndez de Lara taught clinical practice; Dr. Pablo Fuentes y Herrera, materia medica ; Dr. Juan N. and Dr. Manuel M. See Salinas Ramos, Luis. S\u00edntesis para la historia de la medicina en M\u00e9xi co. Revista MH. N\u00famero 34. 1984, cited in Francois Flores, Historia de la homeopat\u00eda en M\u00e9xico 32. 6 The Law of Public Instruction regulated professional schools' academic curriculum in the Federal District and the Federal Territories. D\u00edaz's signed the dec ree on August 10, 1895. It would not be effective until January 1, 1896. This regulatory trend did not differ from previous attempts to regulate homeopathic medical training in Veracruz and Puebla in the early 1880s, where students of homeopathy needed to be proficient in almost the same curricular content as their non -homeopathic peers. In addition, 109 prospective students needed to have previously attended the National Preparatory School. To obtain their medical degree, they had to undertake 19 courses in a span of five years after which they took their professional exam. The new academic curriculum of the homeopathic school was thematically a copy of the one offered by the ENM, though less extensive in terms of the number of courses taught for a single topic (see Table 1). For instance the ENM offered one course more of internal and external pathology, and of internal and external clinical practice . Instead the ENMH offered three extra -courses on materia medica and therapeutics. The ENMH curriculum also the course \"Foundations and expositions of the [homeopathic] doctrine\", which the ENM did not. D\u00edaz's regulation of homeopathic medical tra ining also resulted in the legal recognition of ENMH's medical degrees. The decree required ENMH's professors to be legal phy sicians, in other words, holders of degrees obtained in state -regulated medical schools. They also needed to be members of the home opathic professional society. With regular professors and an authorized medical curriculum, the ENMH medical degree acquired a legal status that according to the decree aimed to protect consumers of homeopathy by \"preventing the abuse of those who practice without the authorized knowledge or medical degree\" .7 The Academy was given the status of \"national\" \u2014 hence the name of the school \u2014 just to make its courses legal, and to give those who obtained the degree of M\u00e9dico Cirujano Home\u00f3pata [Homeopathic Medic al Al\u00f3patas [Medical Doctors] . With such intentions, D\u00edaz seemed to cope with one of Mexico City's persistent problems during his 30 - year term, the presence of irregular practitioners. Having a s tate-sanctioned school for a they need to undertake courses proper to homeopathy. The internal regulations of the Academy of Homeopathy followed D\u00edaz's decree in the configuration of its a cademic curriculum. See \"DECRETO.\" ; and \"Reglamento de la Escuela de Medicina de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico\", AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 1, 5. 7 See \"DECRETO.\" 110 therapeutic system that was widely consumed, but most importantly prescribed, by both social elites and the working -class seemed to provide medical training to individuals who could not afford elite medical training at the ENM. In other words, D\u00edaz aimed to regulate irregular practice by providing medical training to the working class. The position of the ENMH within Porfirian , Madero's, and Huerta's government structures hindered its material progress for two decades. The home opathic hospital hosted the school during this period, and the Ministry of the Interior, which funded the hospital, did not pay for faculty salaries or other ENMH's specific needs .8 Material improvements to the hospital impacted the school, though, which m eant that any improvement to the hospital also improved the school .9 For instance, the hospital provided classrooms for lectures and facilities and patients to carry out clinical practices. Moreover, the Ministry did not originally give any medical instrum entation t o the hospital in 1895. Sixteen years later, the hospital's inventory registered a large list of \"scientific instruments\" which were useful for clinical practice and might also be used for instruction .10 Throughout the first two decades of the 20th century, the ENMH remained beyond the regulatory efforts of the Ministry of Public Instruction. Consequently, ENM graduates who controlled this Ministry and who questioned ENMH's medical training and existence as a state - funded medical school could not control or update its academic curriculum as they did with the ENM's. ENM graduates such as Quevedo y Zubieta and Porfirio Parra regarded the state 8 The section of the homeopathic hospital in the AHSS holds several letters with petitions from Joaqu\u00edn Segura y Pesado, head of both the hospital and the school during this period, to either the Ministry of the Interior or the head of the Office of Public Welfare to request material for the out -patient clin ic, but nothing specific for the school during this time period. See AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 1, 7. 9 In 1910 the head of the hospital requested painting for the hospital facilities because it would host a meeting with foreign homeopathic practitioners to comme morate the anniversary of Mexico's independence. He also requested other minor fixes produced by an earthquake and the rainy season during 1911. AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 1, 15. 10 AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 1, 1, 26 -35, and 1, 18, 3 -5. 111 sponsorship of the homeopathic school as a \"bifurcation of science\" in 1895 .11 They believed that medical sci ence ought to be unified and that doctrinal differences should be taught within a single school. Instead of opening schools for every medical method or procedure, Quevedo said, the government should provide material elements to advance the practical instru ction of basic sciences in one single medical school. Moreover, he denounced the structural contradiction of Diaz's government by placing the homeopathic school outside the jurisdiction of the ministry that regulated public instruction. This opinion persis ted after a decade. When D\u00edaz asked Eduardo Liceaga, head of the ENM, about opening a new homeopathic school in 1904, Liceaga replied that homeopathy only differed from medical science \"in the way it prescribed medicines\", and as a consequence, he deemed a s administratively illogic al to keep a separated school or create a new one which would offer the same medical training as in the ENM . \"There would not be any reason to build a National Homeopathic School [...] just because [that school] uses a special modal ity to prescribe medications\", he concluded.12 Its position outside the Ministry of Justice and Public Instruction ma de ENMH lag behind ENM's curricular reforms. The ENM's curriculum went through four changes during the Porfiriato in order to cope with the dramatic changes taking place in the medical sciences at turn of the 20th century. Curricular changes aimed to expose new medical students to specialties such as bacteriology, histology, mental diseases, gynecology, and ophthalmology \u2014 all topics offered 11 The term was Quevedo's, but both held a similar opinion about homeopathy and the ENMH. Quevedo y September 28, 1895; and Parra, \"La medicina .septiembre y octubre (1895). 12 The new school of homeopathy did not open, but Eduardo Liceaga and the ministry of instruction did not have authority to stop the ENMH from working. See Justino Fernandez, Correspondencia and Eduardo Liceaga, Personal letter to the Ministry of Justice and Public Instruction, AHUNAM, ENM, ENMH, 43, 4, pp. 27-33. 112 in the most re nowned medical schools in Europe .13 These changes continued after 1910 for political rather than academic reasons .14 The pedagogic impulse that drove such changes was learning thro ugh practice rather than theory, at the bedside and in the hospit al, in cadaver s and patients, rather than in libraries using texts and printed images. In contrast, the ENMH's curriculum remained unmodified until 1916 (See T able 1). Yet ENMH dissertation titles suggest that this unmodified curriculum did not influence graduates to merely pursue careers in homeopathy, as some E NM graduates argued (see below), t hough having a faculty of homeopaths did have an effect on students' interest i n this particular therapy .15 Half of the dissertations approached regular medical iss ues such as pleurisy, puerperal fever, gastric disorders or dietetics, antiseptics, epidemic diseases, and medicinal plants, and the rest discussed the philosophical principles behind homeopathy, the therapeutic superiority of homeopathy over surgery or ot her allopathic therapeutic procedures, and the homeopathic way to treat specific diseases. As a consequence of the homeopathic school's lag in facility improvements and curricular updates, it turned into a second -class medical school . While still offering basic medical training, it did not withst and the changes in medical science that were taking place during the first decades of the 20th century. In the eyes of the medical elite, homeopathic doctors 13 In 1881, 1897, 1902, 1906. Ana Mar\u00eda Carrillo and Juan Jos\u00e9 Salda\u00f1a analyze ENMS's academic curriculums and the school's relationship with other government institutions in Carrillo and Salda\u00f1a, \"La ense\u00f1anza de la medicina en la Escuela Nacional durante el Porfiriato.\" 14 Every political leader during the armed phase of the revolution brought his own educational ideals and political allies to run the National University, created in 1910, and consequently to run the university's medical school, the ENM. Enriq ue Herrera Moreno analyses the ENM's curricular changes from 1833 to the early 1920s. Enrique Herrera Moreno, \"La Escuela de Medicina de M\u00e9xico,\" Memorias y revista de la Academia Nacional de Ciencias Antonio Alzate 43 (1925). 15 Of 33 dissertations reported from 1896 to 1906, 17 approached regular medical topics and the rest discussed homeopathy in contrast to allopathy. Juan Antiga kept a track of ENMH's dissertations de M\u00e9x ico.\" There are only three dissertations that discussed homeopathy in the ENM during the 19th century registered in Carmen Casta\u00f1eda de la Universidad, 1988). . 113 were poorly trained physicians who specialized in the us e of a single therapeutic approach .16 In these terms, the goal of the homeopathic physicians who created the ENMH to uplift the status of homeopathy failed in the long term. However, in numerical terms, the homeopathic school became the second more important medical school in the city in terms of the number of graduates it produced. In 1900, a national c ensus reported that only 9.3% of the total number of physicians in Mexico City was homeopaths; 8.2 if considered nationally. The DSP records show that the proportion of homeopaths vs. allopaths with license to practice medicine in Mexico City increased from 3.7% to 6.9% from 1871 to 1907 (See Table 2) .17 While these statistics su ggest a success of the homeopathic school in terms of regulating the homeopathic profession, they also provided ENM faculty with the information to argue that this school only diverted state funds that otherwise could be used in the ENM's academic and mate rial improvement. 16 See Justino Fernandez, and Eduardo Liceaga, Personal letter to the Ministry of Justice and Public Instruct ion, AHUNAM, ENM, (M\u00e9xico, D. F.: El Colegio de M\u00e9xico, 1982). Foreign medical directories reduced that figure to 0.74% at the national level. \"The Standard medical directory of North America, 1903 -4,\" (Chicago: G. P. Engelhard, 1903), vol. The i nformation of the DSP was calculated from \"Lista de 1. 114 115 116 117 118 \"Revolutionaries by heart\" or \"science is not the privilege of the wealthy\": two models of homeopathic medical schools during the revolution, 1910 -20 Carranza's administration (1914 -20) initiated a series of changes that impacted the homeopathic school. The school's faculty elected a new Dean and Directive Board, which were ratified by Carranza's government in 1914 .18 Led by the new Dean, Luis F. Porragas, the ENMH went through curricular improvements in exchange for the go vernment's economic support during Carranza's term. Using a revolutionary rhetoric, Porragas explained the school's slow progress as a consequence of the lack of economic support in July 1916 . Accordingly, the \"homeopathic physician needs to sacrifice his time to provide an inefficient and unpaid service.\"19 Porragas did not blame his faculty \"for the human heart seeks improvements, which [the homeopath] cannot achieve when he comes to the School for jobs without stipend.\"20 For this reason, he demanded t hat the new Minister of the Interior include the school in the Ministry's budget. \"[A]s the revolution came to protect everything that implies improvement \u2014 Porragas said \u2014 [...] we [...] revolutionaries by heart [...] come to tell you with adherence to the law, and according to our humanitarian motto, give the support that the noble cause we sustain demands\".21 A few months later, the school's Board authorized a new curriculum that showed that the medical \"knowledge provided by [the homeopathic school was] the same a s the 18 Correspo ndence between the Office of Public Welfare, the Subminster of the Interior and the Dean of the ENMH, during October, 1914, see AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 1, 22, pp. 1 -4. 19 See L etter from Luis F.

Porragas and Ambrosio Vargas to the Ministry of Interior, July 7th, 1916 119 one taught at any Allopathic School of Medicine.\"22 This new curriculum closely resembled that of the ENM (See Table 1). Porragas' attitude was indicative of a generational shift. Founders of the ENMH adopted the 19th century discourse that sought ho meopathy to thrive as a medical system and profession, parallel to what they called allopathy or the traditional school. For this reason, they wanted the same legal and social status for their school as the ENM had. In contrast, Porragas internalized the d iscourse of the medical elite, recognizing that the school \"had not progressed as desired\" and that students \"had not achieved all the required knowledge\" .23 Founders of the ENMH offered their professional services as charity, in order to secure government support. This new generation of homeopathic doctors sought a new relationship with the government that demanded remuneration for professional services .24 For instance, Rafael Isa\u00edas y Fern\u00e1ndez, head of the homeopathic hospital in 1916, requested that homeo pathic doctors and students with their clinical practices at the institution receive a stipend; \"besides being fair that they receive [such a stipend] in payment for their work, it creates the right to demand the exact fulfillment of their duties.\"25 But h omeopaths ' demands surpassed what the government was willing to grant. Moreover, obtaining government support implied that homeopathic institutions depended directly on the volatile politics of the time. Porragas' correspondence to the Minister of the 22 See correspondence August 16, 1916 and October 23, 1916 in AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 1, 28, 16.

He even granted that if there was no ward available for the school, modifications should be carried out i n the General Hospital to fulfill his demands. But the relocation of the ENMH was more expensive than keeping the hospital in its place, and both the school and hospital remained untouched .29 After the politically turbulent and deeply violent years of the armed phase of the revolution when Carranza started to reconstruct the state's institutions, homeopaths' demands went beyond Carranza's political and economic willingness to support homeopaths ' school. However, during this decade a different model of professional educa tion started to develop. The model of escuelas libres [literally free schools, referred to those schools that did not receive state funds; in other words private schools] emerged in 1912, amidst the revolutionary 26 A letter -presumably from Luis F. Porragas - on August 16, 1916 said that \"today, the actual government filled with good will brings its attention to our cause and promises to offer its support. The school is undertaking reforms and hospital [facilities] a re improving, showing proof that we are walking through a wider path. For this reason we make public the foundations of our studies where anyone will see that they are the same as in any Medical School.\" AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 1, 28, pp. 16. 27 In a report of e xpenses in the homeopathic hospital in February, 1918, the head of the HNH highlighted the need of having salaries to pay interns. \"It was their right to receive a payment for their job -he said, [...] that would give [the head of the hospital] the right to demand the accomplishment of their duties\". Apparently having to pay for professors and hospital interns was too much for President Carranza, who decided to close the homeopathic hospital and relocate the school in. \"Informe administrativo que manifiesta l as mejoras este desde 1917\", AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 1, 1, pp. 9 28 Fernando Cuen, letter from the Secretary General of the office of Trasury addressed to the General Director of P ublic Beneficence of the Department of the Federal District, June 7, 1918, AHSS, BP, EN, HNH, 2, 6, pp. 1 29 Letters between the responsibles of the offices of Public Beneficence and Treasury, June 7 -10, 1918, AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 2, 16, pp. 1 -2 121 process .30 These schools sought to provide professional training independent of government regulation, particularly after the creation of the Universidad Nacional de M\u00e9xico [hereon UNM; currently UNAM31] in 1910 as a central office that regulated professiona l schools in Mexico City.32 Originally it was no more than an office that organized and administered National Schools located in Mexico City (Law, Engineering, Medicine, Architecture, High Studies, and the National Preparat ory School) ,33 but after the triumph of the Constitutionalist Army in 1914, Carranza's government gave it the status of a ministry and made it responsible for education in the whole nation. Political instability and inconsistencies in the regulatory framewo rk at the national level did not allowed university authorities to extend their policies beyond Mexico City. But even in the city, the model of free schools aimed to counterweight the authority of the university. The Escuela Libre de Derecho [Free School o f Law] first initiated operations in 1912, closely followed by the Escuela Libre de Homeopatia [hereon ELHM after its current name Free School of Homeopathy of Mexico]. Rather than an open effort to undermine the UNM's authority, as the Free School of Law was, the ELHM started as an effort to provide homeopathic training to the working class. Its founder, Higinio G. P\u00e9rez , would use this rhetoric to attract a larger population of students contrasted to the one the ENMH received, promoting the model of a 30 Francisco A rce Gurza, \"El inicio de una El Colegio de M\u00e9xico, 1982) 232 -4. 31 I will not be using the actual acronym for the national university. Since the regula tion of medical schools and particularly homeopathic ones closely depended on the relationship of the university with the federal government, I want to make clear the difference between an institution closely aligned in administrative terms with the acrony m UNM, and one with autonomy the autonomy for curricular and administrative self -regulation with the acronym UNAM. UNAM obtained its autonomy in 1929. 32 Javier Garciadiego \"De Justo don Edmundo O'Gorman (Apr - Jun, 1997): 776 - 77. Dant\u00e1n, 46.4 (1997): 776 -7. 122 private school as the ideal one to push homeopathy forward. Perez adopted the rhetoric used 50 years earlier by homeopathic practitioners and entrepreneurs to provide healing services and sell homeopathic first -aid kits to those who did not have access to a p hysician. Perez used his particular approach to homeopathy as an ideology under which he created a group that defended the rights of the working -class to have access to medical training. Just as Porragas represented a group of homeopaths who had assimilat ed the need for an education based on the new medical sciences and was willing to align ENMH's curriculum with ENM's ,34 Higinio P\u00e9rez represented a group that was not convinced that all medical science and scientific breakthroughs benefited the homeopathic physician. This tension between being a true homeopath or one who used other therapeutic approaches besides homeopathy had always been an issue of concern among homeopaths and their critics .35 But in a school specifically designed to teach homeopathy, homeo paths needed to clarify their position, as Porragas did in 1916. Yet during the early days of the ENMH , this position was far from clear. Having a curriculum that 34 Porragas' position is difficult to assess. He did modify the ENMH's academic curriculum in 1916, but it seems that he did it to obtain funds to improve t he homeopathic school, rather than for any doctrinarian conviction. As I will analyze below, he was also a member of the Academy that Higinio P\u00e9rez created to group together those homeopaths who pursued orthodox homeopathy in 1910. In the early 1920s, he never showed up to discuss the eventual merging of the ENMH to the ENM, probably regarding it as a lost cause. Rather than someone who ceded to allopathy, he should be regarded as someone who took the opportunities he found to attract resources to the ENMH. Though in so doing it he tacitly acknowledged the medical ideology imposed by the ENM academic curriculum. See below for an analysis of ENMH merger to the ENM. 35 In the 1870s the distinction between pure homeopaths and those who were not pure was based o n the use of highly diluted doses or not. Generally, physicians educated at the ENM believed that it was necessary to prove all dilutions even concentrated ones in order to see their effects, while practitioners generally preferred to stick to Hahnemann's works and use only highly diluted doses. Salinas y Rivera, \"Ensayos sobre la homeopat\u00eda.\" ; Marchena, in 1876 Fenelon said \"All practitioners (and there were several of them) who visited and observed [one specific patient who had a uterine polyp] recommended to remove it, and this need imposed upon everyone in such a way that one of those who abuse d of the public indulgence by practicing homeopathy agreed on the prescription. He did not dare to prescribe a diluted and dynamized fibroid polyp as he should've done if he were a faithful disciple of Hahnemann, missing the 'similia similibus'. But the patient was not accommodated and the risk w as not worth the gain\". Fenelon, \"CIRUG\u00cdA. local,\" 40 -1. 123 mixed courses on medical science and homeopathy was confusing for faculty, let alone students . For instance, in his 1904 article \"What is needed to train good homeopathic doctors?\", Juan Antiga Escobar , a Cuban immigrant doctor who became a homeopath in Mexico36, argued that true homeopaths needed to engage in a profound study of Hahnemann's Organo n in order to understand homeopathy in its totality .\"[W]hen this knowledge is better diffused, and homeopathic schools teach Homeopathic Philosophy without reforms, as pure as it sprouted from the genius, then the new science of therapeutics [referring to homeopathy] will be thoroughly practiced and free of cri tiques \" \u2014 he concluded.37 Yet two years later Antiga published an article in which he described a \"medical school of the future\" as one where students learned that there were only \"natural and undisputable laws\" without any doctrinarian distinctions.38 Claim ing the need for every doctor to learn different therapeutic methods, he emphasized that no sectarianism should exist. No doctor should place one method as \"the single one, 'sinequa non' of the therapeutic desideratum.\"39 The contradict ion between being a \" good homeopathic doctor\" or a 36 He was a Cuban immigrant who obtained a homeopathic degree from the ENMH in 1901 and who sponsored a homeopathic society and jour nal in the 1910s. He graduated as a physician from the University of Havana in 1892. His activities supporting Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed and his revolutionary movement led him to travel widely between the island and the US. He arrived in Mexico in 1896 where he obtained a degree from the ENM and later from the ENMH. The Sanitary Board of Health sent him with a commission to study yellow fever to Chiapas. From there he travelled widely throughout Central and South America. He was professor of Pathology at the Free Universi ty of El Salvador; he practiced medicine in Costa Rica, and Ecuador. He returned to Mexico in 1899 and established as a homeopathic doctor. He was one of the founders of the Academia Homeop\u00e1tica Mexicana in 1904. He was editor of La Propaganda homeop\u00e1tica since 1902 until he stop publishing it in 1908. There he publicized homeopathy and other therapeutic commodities he distributed in Mexico City. He left Mexico in 1911. Gregorio Delgado Garc\u00eda, \"El doctor Juan Bolet\u00edn Mexicano de Historia y Filosf\u00eda de (2005).

Higinio P\u00e9rez followed the regular career path of a homeopathic doctor of his time40 and might have s uffered doctrinarian uncertainties as Antiga did. His own particular vision of homeopathy did not materialize until 1910 when he gathered a group of ENMH graduates into an academic society of \"radical purists\" that aimed to establish as a parallel institut ion to the National Academy of Medicine, hence its name, Academia Homeop\u00e1tica de Mexico [Homeopathic Academy of Mexico] .41 Members of this new academy proposed to use therapeutic approaches that resembled or stimulated the body's nat ural way of healing and consequently rejected approaches that opposed natural healing forces and produced a non - natural, sometimes worse, form of disease .42 Highlighting that this was the truly core of 40 He followed an orthodox career path for a physician who did not belong to urban elites during the Porfiriato , and for a student of medicine who eventually became a homeopath. He was born in Alfajayucan, Hidalgo, a town loca ted 75 miles north from Mexico City, in 1865. He spent his early years studying at the local church before moving to the state's capital seminar to pursue an ecclesiastical career. P\u00e9rez subsequently moved to Mexico City where he attempted to study laws, b ut after a couple of years in the ENM he ended up studying medicine in the ENMH. After three years, he graduated in 1899 with the dissertation title: \"Morbid individuality\". He became faculty member of his alma mater, where he taught General Pathology and Histology. He established a private practice in Mexico City in the early years of the 20th century. See Fernando Dar\u00edo Francois -Flores, de M\u00e9xico, A. C., 2004) 15 - 18. 41 The act that created the Academy was signed on October 19, 1909. Higinio G. P\u00e9rez gathered the group that organized into the Board of the Academy. This Board was integrated by Francisco Castillo, President, Higinio G. P\u00e9rez, Vice -president, Alfredo Ortega , Secretary, and Luis F. Porragas, Treasurer. While not part of the Board, Joaqu\u00edn Segura y Pesado and Ignacio Fern\u00e1ndez de Lara figured as honorary President and Vice -President, respectively, acknowledging their status as founders of the National Homeopat hic Hospital and School. \"Acta de Instalaci\u00f3n de la Academia Homeop\u00e1tica de on AELHM], pp. 1. 42 For instance, they believed that orthodox homeopathy did not oppose to general practices in medicine such as surgery, toxicology, hygiene, and mechanical medicine, but they were specific about the prohibition of certain contemporary therapies, such as antiseptics, thermal waters, caustics, cauteries, plasters, concoctions, and poultices. They did not like injections to introduce serum, narcotics, or analgesics in the body, not even as palliative medicine, but they believed that a true homeopath could use that type of therapy only if the patient asked for it. They also disagreed with cleansing inje ctions for natural childbirths, but totally agreed with anesthetic injections for surgery. \"Alocuci\u00f3n del Dr. Higinio G. P\u00e9rez, al inaugurarse la Academia Homeop\u00e1tica de de 125 Hahnemann's homeopathic doctrine, Higinio P\u00e9rez applied a sectarian ethos to this particular approach to homeopathy. In his speech at the Academy's inauguration, he compared \"orthodox\" homeopathy to the \"eternal truth\", and criticized those who \"diverted their steps from the pathway of light and preferred to walk through the dark and lost path of Allopathy.\" For him, the \"true homeopath\" was a \"true priest of medicine and apostle of the altruistic science that homeopathy was\".43 Higinio P \u00e9rez pursued such \"homeopathic altruism\" to create a proprietary homeopathic school with working cl ass sensibilities.44 The narratives about ELHM origins point to its working -class sensibilities rather than to its medical sectarian emphasis, though once established , the school turned into a symbol of medical sectarianism, working -class rights to medical training, and independence from government regulation . In 1912, two disappointed working - class students who could not attend the ENMH approached Higinio G. P\u00e9rez for advice. He offered himself to lecture if they gathered a bigger group. One month later, tw enty persons , professional teachers or students who could not continue their professional studies , attended P\u00e9rez 's classes early in the morning and late at night, a schedule particularly suited for those who attended regular job duties.45 Consequently, t he newly created Escuela Libre de Pr\u00e1cticos M\u00e9xico, AELHM, pp. of Actas de la Academia Homeop\u00e1tica de M\u00e9xico, AELHM, 43 \"Alocuci\u00f3n P\u00e9rez, al inaugurarse la Academia Homeop\u00e1tica de M\u00e9xico\" 44 The life of the Academy was ephemeral, probably as a result of the political turmoil during 1910. Their members stop gathering after a few months, but they continued supporting homeopathy, sometimes effectively sometimes not. For instance, Luis F. Porraga s tried to improve medical education in the ENMH. Jos\u00e9 D. Conde Perera became the president of the Sociedad M\u00e9dico -Homeop\u00e1tica de Yucat\u00e1n in the early 1920s. This society created a homeopathic school within the Universidad Nacional del Sureste Dn. Felipe Revista de Medicina Homeop\u00e1tica 2.1 (1922). 45 The early Libre is from Querido de la Uni\u00f3n,\" (M\u00e9xico: 1924), vol., 75 - 76. See also Francois La Escuela Libre of Homeopathic Practitioners] aimed to train working class students. However, acknowledging that they were receiving professional training, students decided to rename the institution as Escu ela Libre de Homeopat\u00eda [Free School of Homeopathy] six months later after it was established. This insinuated students' desire to be considred professional doctors as a logical consequence of the training they received. Eventually this aspiration led them to confront the state's policies that regulated the medical profession. In contrast to the ENMH, the ELHM was the result of one individual's efforts to provide education to the working class. Consequently its material resources were limited , and its acade mic curriculum was not as developed as the ENM's. Higinio P\u00e9rez's own residences originally hosted the school, but the increasing demand made him look for new facilities that accommodated classrooms and a sanatorium in 1913. In 1917, the medical sanatorium was transformed into a small clinic and a consulting office. In 1913, t he ELHM's academic curriculum was not as developed as the one offered at the ENM or the ENMH (See Table 1) . The ELHM offered 14 courses distributed over four years. Contrasted to the E NM's curriculum, the ELHM offered no training in \"basic sciences\" such as medical chemistry, medical physics, histology, and bacteriology ; also no dissection practice, less clinical practice, and no courses on pharmacy or physiotherapy. In contrast to the ENMH's curriculum, the difference was mainly in extent , for both schools offered the same courses. In 1921, after having remodeled his own house and installed new facilities, Perez moved the school back to its original installations. The remodeled building had now classrooms specifically dedicated to courses of surgery and obstetrics, a laboratory, three rooms for clinical practices, one conference room, one consulting office where students offered free medical services, a library, administrative offices an d a large green area. Eventually, an amphitheater w as 127 built; meanwhile students started doing their dissection practices at the crematories of \"Dolores\" Graveyard. Students had been requesting cadaver s, bones or skulls to this graveyard early since the cre ation of the school, but in 1921 they obtained a permission from the local government to do their dissection practices early in the morning, from 6 to 8 am, before attendants to the cemetery arrive d. In exchange, the local governor requested students open up four free consulting offices to provide medical services to the population who lived near the graveyard.46 In exchence of material resources to complete their training, homeopaths offered health services which in turn gave them the clinical practice thei r training required. In curricular terms, the differences between the ENM and ELHM remained the same through the second half of the 1910s (see Table 1). As an additional provider of medical training to the population of Mexico City in the early 1910s, the ELHM and its model for proprietary medical schools became the target of critiques from the medical establishment. Francisco I. Madero , the land owner and homeopath that I analyzed in Chapter 1, became the first democratically elected President after 30 ye ars of dictatorship. Having a President that used, practiced, and promoted h omeopathy caused uncertainty among the National Academy of Medicine. This uncertainty was dissipated w hen Madero acknowledge d the Academy early in 1912 as an official institution t hat his government would consult on matters of sanitation, medicine , and health .47 Consequently, t he Academy felt less compromised to make a public critiques to homeopathic practice. For instance, during a celebration to congratulate Madero's decision, Rica rdo E. Manuell, President of the Academy, talked about how medical science had defeated most of the \"plagues\" in the country, but not the 46 See AHCM, AGDF, P, Academy requested such acknowledgment to Presdient Madero. On January 9, 1912, D\u00edaz Lombardo replied that Madero acknowledged it as an \"oficial institituion\" \"La Academia comunicaci\u00f3n,\" Gaceta m\u00e9dica de M\u00e9xico XLIX (1912). 128 most important, the free practice of medicine .48 According to him, the lack of regulation of medical practice in Mexico caused several problems amongst which he included homeopathy. For him homeopaths were a \"national flora that corroded the nation\" whose practice of prescribing globules that lacked any medical substance turned them into \"murderers\" and \"criminals\" who lef t a wounded person bleeding. This attitude extended to the medical community, leading Eduardo Lavalle y Carbajal to criticize the lack of regulations for medical practice and the recently created ELHM .49 Based on his appraisal of the recently created Free School of Law, he criticized the possible obstacles that a \"hypothetical\"50 free medical school might face without funding from such businessmen as Rockefeller. For him, a high -quality medical education required t he building of dissection rooms and hospital s, where students could be trained using the \"three vir tues\" of good medical training \u2014 cadaver s, laboratories, and patients with different kinds of diseases. Such a school, he 48 Among these were native people's healing approaches mingled with traditional religious beliefs; \"more civilized\" domestic remedies whose curative powers were testified by large lists of professionals, even physicians; charlatans w ho spectacularly advertised their services in the streets, offering secret remedies to heal incurable diseases; new drugs or serums whose therapeutic efficacy was certified by non medical authorities such as judges, governors, bishops and the like; and med ical consultation by mail. Ricardo E. Manuell, \"DISCURSO pronunciado por su autor, en anfiteatro de la Preparatoria, marzo de M\u00e9xico VII (Tercera Serie) or XLIX.3 (marzo) (1912). 49 For his analysis about the regulation of medical practice, see Eduardo Lavalle y Carbajal, \"Historia (1913). 50 His work explicitly referred to a hypothetical free school. Yet it is unlikely that Lavalle was not aware of the newly created ELHM. Medical doctors who engaged in historical or sociological research during the twenties rarely recognized private medical scho ols, and when they did it, they considered them too unworthy to be studied. For instance, when in 1926 the National Academy of Medicine called for a prize to the best research that analyzed the contemporary status of medical education in Mexico, none of th e submitted works included a discussion of private schools, not even the ELHM which by that year had graduated 166 students. Only Esteban Pous Ch\u00e1zaro mentioned that he would not include \"those so -called schools that were a plain manifestation of medical p iracy\". \"Dictamen que presenta la comisi\u00f3n designada en Gaceta Gaceta m\u00e9dica de M\u00e9xico 57. 129 continued, also needed to provide a gradual and pedagogical progression in the organization of its courses. Otherwise, he concluded, these schools would only graduate \"m\u00e9dicos de pacotilla\" [literally, rubbish doctors], \"incomplete physicians\" whose lack of thorough knowledge of medicine would make them kill rather than heal patients . He even recalled a case in the USA, where institutions turned \"in one or two years the illiterate son of a central -American\" into a medical doctor. This last statement is telling about the implicit classism that underlay his discourse about adequate medi cal training.51 The tradition of ENM faculty and graduates not directly attacking homeopathy and Lavalle's requirement of a big investment to fund a worthy private medical school suggest that Lavalle might have been openly aware of the ELHM and that he was being politically correct when he did not specifically refer to it. In his critique , he described problems that the school was already facing in 1913. For instance, his comment about the impossibility of funding a private medical school through an unsalar ied faculty and a hundred -student pop ulation paying 5 pesos a month \u2014 as the Free School of Law's faculty and st udents funded their institution \u2014 was also applicable to the ELHM, though the latter was in a much worse situation since students paid an annual fee of 2 pesos. And his description of students at such institutions as \"illiterate\" mimicked Manuell's depiction of homeopaths .52 Higinio P\u00e9rez, founder of the ELHM, regarded this school as a motor of social transformation that benefited Mexican society. At th is school, orthodox homeopathy, which P\u00e9rez regarded as scientific medicine, transformed working class individuals into professionals 51 Lavalle y Carbajal, \"Historia de idea of \"incomplete physician who is only trained to kill patients\" had recently been used by Dr. R. E. Manuell to refer specifically to homeopaths as one of the specific plagues that \"corrode d the nation\". See Manuell, \"DISCURSO pronunciado anfiteatro de la Escuela Preparatoria, el 6 de marzo de 1912.\" 130 with a medical degree. In his view homeopathic science was a tool for class mobility , a tool to redeem the working c lass. In a speech addressed to ELHM students, he acknowledged that the school was blamed for hosting \"masons, shoemakers, and the working class\", and \"improvising professional [doctors]\" with deficient medical training . But he motivated students by highlig hting the school's democratic ethos. The school \"was open to any person without any class distinction who wanted to learn\", he said, because \"science was not a privilege of the wealthy\". He believed that there was more pride in the transformation of workin g-class students into professionals who looked after their fellows than in training more \"wise\" doctors as the ENM did. He compared the school to \"a forge that tempered [student's] spirits, and forged [their] character\", in order to turn them into \"modest practitioners\". He considered that there was no lack of planning in the school's way of training, for small groups and closer interaction with faculty improved students' academic performance.53 Higinio P\u00e9rez 's adaptation of his homeopathic school to provide medical training to the working class attracted larger amounts of students than the ENMH did. The former enrolled 31 students in 1913 .54 In 1916, the ELHM graduated 16 students, while the ENMH graduated only 5 (Graph 1). Even five years after Porragas modi fied the ENMH curriculum with the promise of federal funding, the ENMH la gged behind. In 1921, 20 students graduated from the ELHM , while no ne graduated from the ENMH (see Graph 1). The ELHM became the most important provider of homeopathic doctors in Mexi co City in the early 1920s and 30s. Eventually, its conspicuous presence pushed the Department of Public Health (see chapter 4 and 5 ) and the Ministry of Public Education (see below) to regulate its practice and training. But in the early 1920s the focus of regulation of medical training was the ENMH. 53 See Francois -Flores, La de la ELHM, 1916 -1949\" in AHELHM. 131 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 1896 1898 1890 1902 1904 1920 1922 1924 1926 1928 1930 1932 1934 1936 1938 1940 1942 Number of Graduates Years Graph 1: Graduates from Homeopathic Medical Schools, 1896 -1942 Graduates from Escuela Nacional de Medicina Homeopatica (ENMH) Graduates from other national and foreign homeopathic schools Graduates from Escuela Libre de Homepatia de Mexico (ELHM) Notes: Other national instituions that granted homeopathic titles were the Government of the State of Yucat\u00e1n, the National University of the Southwest at Yucat\u00e1n (which later on would become the School of Homeopathic Medicine of Yucat\u00e1n), and the Homeopathic School of Jalisco.

Section Direcci\u00f3n General \"bifurcation of science\": Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos and the centralization of state - provided medical training in Mexico City at the National Univ ersity of Mexico, 1920 -25 The new President appointed Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos to lead the UNM in 1920. Though widely known as a reformer whose interventions incorporated the native population into a national mestizo culture, Vasconcelos' reforms also impacted pro fessional education. The UNM became a revolutionary institution of the people and for the people, under his lead ership . Administratively, he transformed the university into the Secretar\u00eda de Educaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica [Ministry of Public Education, SEP], a change t hat signaled his priorities. Yet the privileged position of the university within the new office placed it over other professional schools, i.e. free schools, as a center from which the state could start to regulate professional education in the 1920s .55 These changes also impacted schools of homeopath y too. Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos was interested in the status of both homeopathic schools and requested an evaluation that contrasted the national one and the free one . Dr. Gildardo G\u00f3mez and Engineer Fortunato Dozal's noted that both institutions lacked facilities t o provide hands -on experience for students, which in turn ma de these schools rely too much o n lectures . Compared to each other, the ENMH's \"small\" facilities \"without any pedagogic plan\" made it less suitable for professional medical training.56 In a similar fashion, Dr. Donato Moreno criticized the curricula and pedagogic methods of state -regulated schools in general and those of the ENMH in particular as 55 At this moment the issue about how to, if so, regulate professional practice was still under discussion. Attempts to regulate artic le 4 of the constitution which provided the liberty of professions had been undertaken with no success. This situation made the NUM an institution that aimed to regulate professional education in Mexico, but without any legal foundations. For a detail anal ysis of the regulation of professions see chapter 4. 56 The report is dated on September 15, 1920. In the case of the ENMH, it highlighted the actual situation of the school its facilities and academic curriculum. At this moment the school had 51 students enrolled. They counted a total of 77 graduates up to 1920 with a rate of graduation of 3 per year. Gildardo G\u00f3mez encyclopedic, preserving the Comtean system which has been totally abandoned in the civilized world because it only produced erudite and pedantic people who lack[ed] practical competence [.... These school's educational] system lack[ed] any practical studies to produce real abilities and knowledges.57 In contra st, G\u00f3mez and Dozal's report praised the medical facilities and training at the ELHM .58 G\u00f3mez and Dozal described ELHM's facilities as better in terms of size and organization. ELHM classrooms were large, well-ventilated , and well -illuminated, and different school's sections were separated o n different floor s. The ELHM also had a library. The report argued that while ELHM only provid ed courses essential to become a homeopathic medical doctor, the schools curricular content and strcutrue had the advantage of avoiding a course overload that produced mediocre doctors. Dr. Moreno praised ELHM's pedagogic methodology fro training students to use their \"own senses\" rather than \"memorizing\" to build up their own medical experience. \"Their knowledge might be limited, but it is real\", he said. Moreover, students' enthusiasm and the faculty's personalized attention helped overcome any school's material deficiency, he concluded.59 Regardless of ELHM's limited infrastructure and the consequential limited practice that students had and that G\u00f3mez and Dozal acknowledged, the report highlighted the effort of providing medical training without state support, and suggested that the school would provide adequate training if the UNM inspected it regularly. Dr. Moreno requested that the UNM offer at least a one -time stipend to reward the effort of the private homeopathic school. Vasconcelos 57 He introduced himself as Professor of Natural Histor y, Psychology, and Logic in a High School in Zacatecas; professor of Descriptive Anatomy, Surgical Clinics, and Surgical Therapeutics at the ENM; and founder of and professor of Surgical Therapeutics at the Medical School of the Army. Donato Moreno, \"Mi op I.8 (1921). 58 The report also highlighted the differences in the population each school served. These figures are similar to the ones I already analyzed in this chapter. THE ELHM quadrupled the population of enrolled students. 50 students had graduated from the ELHM, m aking a graduation rate of 13 per year. 59 G\u00f3mez and Dozal, \"Sr. Rector de la Universidad Nacional.\" 134 empathized with such arguments, and though he could not offer financial or material support, he agreed to send inspectors to the school or to op en courses at the UNM so that ELHM's students could complete their training .60 Moreover, he brought the discussion about adequate training to regulation when he stated that ELHM medical degrees \"should have\" at least the same status as the ones from the ENM H, because both schools had a similar curriculum. This was more of a personal opinion than a feasible statement, for while in constitutional terms the degrees might have the same status, state institutions and social elites valued official degrees over any others (see chapter 4). Vasconcelos decided to incorporate the ENMH into the UNM two months after the report .61 He might have been influenced by the school's poor infrastructure or Porragas' demands for funds, yet it is more likely that his interest laid in the organization of already existing state professional training institutions under the newly created Secretaria de Educacion Publica [SEP, Ministry of Public Education] rather than the technical needs of particular medical schools. Once hosted by the UNM, the ENMH began to receive funds and improve its facilities and curricular structure, just as Porragas had promised four years earlier.62 Six months after its incorporati on, the school had new facilities and material resources for the library and the 60 Transcription of a correspondence from Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos to the ELHM circa 1920 in response to the reports provided by Dr. Gildardo G\u00f3mez and Eng.

He organized his faculty to \"reform\" the academic curriculum ,64 though he reported that al most all classes in the school's curriculum already offered practical activities .65 For instance, J. M. Carrera, Professor of Physiology, reported several practic al sessions on the effects of gastric substances, digestion, and the use of instruments to meas ure heart rate. Isaac Jim\u00e9nez, Professor of Topographic Anatomy, mentioned that all anatomical regions studied in class had been localized and dissected in c adavers . Yet it seemed that resources were not enough for in 1923 63 A new building to host the school was remodeled outside the homeopathic hospital during January and February. The National Homeopathic Ho spital's was placed in what today is the street of Chimalpopoca at Ave nida 5 de febrero, in Mexico City; and the school was moved to Puente de Alvarado, 78. See Guadalupe Salinas Castillo and Esther Valero Spada, Escuela Nacional de Nacional, 2006), September, 2011 <http://www.libros.publicaciones.ipn.mx/PDF/TOMO_IV.pdf.>. A library was build up from donations and new purchases. The library received a thousand books from the hospital; Juan N. Arriaga, editor of La homeopat\u00eda and translator of several books written by American homeopaths, donated 230 books, pamphlets and other publications; the school bought 27 books. See Albe rto B.

Was Porragas requesting more funds in a veiled fashion? Or did faculty reports overstate their resources and practical pedagogic methodology? Why would Porragas request an increased budget when the number of enrolled students did not increase when the UNM took over the administration of the ENMH? Similar concerns rose am ong ENM faculty who complained about irregularities in the homeopathic school and its high budge t/student ratio. In December 1920, an anonymous author complained in the Gaceta M\u00e9dica Mexican a about the irregularities at the ENMH. He reported that a \"monthly budget of $8, 900 was spent in the education of 22 students who attend the National School of Homeopathy\" , that \"[a person was] listed as professor and student at the same time, [and that] veterinarians who lacked a job and due to the promotion of homeopathy [were] studying homeopathy.\"67 Manuel Godoy, professor of Surgical Therapeutics at the ENM, argued that investing in a school that \"only trained twenty something students\" was \"unnecessar y and hence superfluous\", and that such funding would be better used to improve ENM facilities and the Medical School of the Army .68 The budget of each medical school at the university was calculated according to student enrollment, but even if such differences were taken into account, ENMH students ' costs were as high as twice for ENM students' .69 66 See \"Escuela Nacional de 67 See See Manuel Godoy \u00c1lvarez, \"Con motivo de la ENM and the ENMH had 1550 and 88 students, graduated 57 and 6, and received approximately 692,916 and 106,032 pesos, respectively. The first semester of 1923 each school had 1702 and 161 students, 342 a nd 61 personnel amongst administrative staff and faculty, who received a total of 137 ENM's faculty discomfort lay in havin g lost the privileged position that their school h eld in previous government administration s, both during the Porfiriato and after the revolution. For instance , Godoy's main concern was that Jose Vasconcelos' sponsorship reproduce d the same irregularities as during the Porfiriato , when the Minister of the Interior pressed state governors to pay students from the countryside to study at the ENMH or allowe d students who had not finished their high -school to enroll in this school.70 Godoy suspicions were sounde d for i n the same journal where he published his critique , anonymous authors report ed Vasconcelos ' keenness to patronize students from Cent ral America to study medicine at the ENM. 71 Vasconcelos did more than divert SEP's funds to Central American students . His concern to turn the SEP into an institution that provided education to the popular classes made him withheld resources that ENM faculty believed necessary to improve medical training at their school. For instance, Vasconcelos refused to fund the cons truction of a new building for the ENM in the early 1920s. He believed that the Palace of the Inquisition, the building that hosted the school , provided the space needed to carry out medical training . He argued that the SEP had broadened the scope of publi c education, but that in order for the government office to commit to the promotion of culture amongst Mexican people, it was necessary that the medical profession funded the construction of the new facilities. His anit -elitist position led Vasconcelos say that 295,609 and 56,290 in salaries, respectively. These figures indicate that the state invested an average of 447.04 pesos per student at the ENM and 777.27 pesos per student at the ENMH from 1922 to mid -1923. The cost to educate homeopaths was twice as much as that for allopaths, despite the increase of ENMH student's population and lower salaries paid to ENM Medicina III.34 (abril, 1923). 71 The cost of funding 34 Central American and Mexican students in the ENM during 1922 was 19,505 pesos, 20% the amount funded to the ENMH; no student of the homeopathic schoo l received 138 since \"there were so many rich physicians, funds for the construction of the building could be collected from them \".72 Pecuniary concerns translated into doctrinarian discussions. When the ENMH became one of the medical schools within the university, Manuel Godoy initiated a campaign to discredit homeopaths' status as medical doctors, actualizing 19th-century critiques about homeopaths lacking medical training . For him homeopaths ' sectarian approach inclined them to discredit true medical science in fa vor of their sectarian approach, leading them into a poor medical criterion. Godoy noted that because of their blind faith, truly sectarian, in the Hahnemann 's system, [professors of the ENMH] did not consider truly necessary the deep study of topics that constituted traditional medicine, and if they taught them, it [was] because they were obliged by law. It was understandable [hence...] that these topics received very secondary attention, as they considered them inferior and opposite to their system.73 Even worse for Godoy was that as clinical practice was undertaken at the homeopathic hospital where only homeopathic methods were taught, students were left without any exposure to the practice of allopathic therapeutics. At the institutional level, he accuse d homoeopaths of usurping the place that graduates from ENM should have. Not having the proper medical training, homeopaths prescribed medications they were not trained to use, and they advertised their services as medical doctors, never mentioning that th ey were homeopaths. To solve this situation, Godoy proposed that homeopaths undert ake the curriculum as the rest of students of medicine did at the ENM; that the ENMH be closed and its funds reassigned to the ENM in order to improve medical education at one single professional medical school; and that special courses of homeopathy be offered at the 72 See Excelsior , March 14, 1923, cited in Bolet\u00edn de la Secretar\u00eda de Educaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica . I. 3, 1923, pp. For 1920s see Godoy \u00c1lvarez, \"Con motivo de la incorporaci\u00f3n Homeopat\u00eda en el Departamento Universitario,\" 3. 139 homeopathic hospital. Was Godoy accurate in his critique of the ENMH or was he only reproducing a common trope about homeopathic medical training amongst his pro fessional peers? In other words, w ere ENMH faculty as sectarian as, for instance, Higinio P\u00e9rez? The discussion about hands -on experience in medical training flooded the discourse of medical school authorities in the 1920s .74 Under Carranza's administration , Dr. Amo r, the ENM's d ean (1916 -20), modified the academic curriculum and made practical classes mandatory , clearly establishing the number of classes in each course and the minimum that a student should attend in order to be examined in a specific course. He a lso named faculty responsible for laboratories and dissection rooms t o coordinat these classes. When Dr. Guillermo Parra replaced Dr. Amor in May 1920, he continued to promot e the school's growth by increasing the number of faculty, opening new clinical classes, and expanding the school's infrastructure.75 Since Porragas had used the ENM's academic curriculum as a model to improve the ENMH's, both medical schools' curricula were essentially the same in the early 1920s. When closely analyzed, figu res show that the ENM offered slightly more practical courses, particularly in anatomy, pathology and clinical practice (See Table 1). The ENMH's curriculum offered one course more of therapeutics and one more of material medica , keeping the same emphasis on these topics as in previous years. In order to accommodate such a curricular load, the ENM took six years to graduate a student, while the ENMH needed only five. The total number of courses 74 Dr. Enrique Herrera Moreno offered an analysis of the changes in the academic curriculum of the ENM since the creation of the school in 1833 to the early 1920s where he criticized the lack of emphasis of physiological know ledge, particularly during the 20th century. Herrera Moreno, \"La Escuela de Medicina de M\u00e9xico.\" Dr. Fernando Ocaranza, who was secretary of the ENM from 1921 to 1923 and director from 1924 to 1934, held a similar opinion. See, for instance, Fernando Ocara nza, Breve historia de la la Cultura y 201 -2. For him, the \"physiological thought\" -the one that Claude Bernard introduced to medicine - had to be central in the ENM's academic curriculum if it wanted to belong to the group of most advanced medical schools in the world. 75 Ocaranza, Breve historia de la Facultad de Medicina 29-30. 140 offered by the ENM and the ENMH was 39 and 28, respectively. Wh ile some of the ENM courses, such as logic and medical morality, did not require any practical instruction, in general this school offered more practical training contrasted to the homeopathic one. There is no evidence that indicates that ENMH faculty was sectarian as Godoy critiqued. Moreover, Porragas' willingness to modify the ENMH curriculum in 1916 indicates otherwise. Yet, as G\u00f3mez and Dozal report ed and as Moreno's letter indicated before Godoy, it seemed that ENMH students received less practical tr aining than their counterparts at the ENM . By incorporating the ENMH into the university, Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos achieved the central regulation of all professional medical schools with the consequential improvement of ENMH's facilities and curriculum. His inte nded administrative centralization did not imply doctrina ire communion between the two medical schools within the university. On the contrary , the rhetoric of ENM's faculty to discredit ENMH's medical training was intertwined with the former's inability to monopolize state -supported medical training, which perpetuated what Quevedo y Zubieta called in 1895 the \"bifurcation of science\". But through further administrative reforms, ENM's faculty took the opportunity to merge the ENMH to the ENM and transform th e official degree of homeopathic medical doctor into a medical specialty. With it, ENM's model of medical training became the one sanctioned by the state and hence the \"official\" one. President \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n 's decree of October 9, 1923, ordered the incor poration of the homeopathic school into the ENM, arguing that ENMH students would benefit from adequate practical medical training at the ENM and that the ongoing administration would reduce the budget allocated to state -funded medical schools .76 But the no tion of \"incorporation\" was 76 Savings we re around 100, 000 pesos to train 40 students of homeopathy. See Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n, Acuerdo Num. 4230 de fecha 9 de octubre d e 1923 del C. Presidente de la republica, Copy of the presidential agreement where \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n decrees the unification of the Schoo l of Homeopathic Medicine to the Faculty of Medicine, AHUNAM, ENAE, 8, 161, p. 5 141 contested and highly negotiated by authorities of both medical schools during the discussions that planned how to actually implement the presidential decree before the effective date of January 1, 1924 .77 During the negotiations, there was a clear intention to offer both medical majors \u2014 homeop athic doctor and medical doctor \u2014 within the ENM. In the presidential decree, \"incorporation\" of the ENMH originally meant a more efficient use of material resources within the university. B ut the timing of discussions within the University Council that planned the merger, the willingness of ENM faculty to unify medical training, and the willingness of ENMH faculty and students to be acknowledged both as true scientific physicians and as an independent academic group led homeopaths to lose the school that distinguish ed them as a parallel medical profession. The timing of academic reforms suggests that Bernardo Gast\u00e9lum, SEP's vice -president and also a medical doctor, sided with ENM faculty, w ho in turn used their privileged position 77 There were multiple reactions from the medical community which tried to change the Presidential decision. While they eventually succeeded, discussions in the University Coun cil were already taking place and President Obreg\u00f3n did nothing to stop them. Rafael Colom\u00e9, Jos\u00e9 D. Conde and Alonso V. Gamboa, president, vice -president, and member, respectively, of the Sociedad M\u00e9dico -homeop\u00e1tica de Yucat\u00e1n sent a telegram to the Presi dent requesting that the ENMH remained independent because the idea of merging training in both medical approaches was unattainable and because the entire scientific world possessed an academic representation of homeopathy. So did Miguel R. Zece\u00f1a and E. C asta\u00f1on Rinc\u00f3n, president and secretary of the Sociedad de estudiantes de la ENMH , who requested \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n that he kept the school independent. President conceded and through his minister of the interior he let faculty of the ENMH know that he would reconsider his decision if they decided to offer their services without payment, a s faculty had done it during the Porfiriato. Faculty agreed, and they formed a commission to discuss the proposal. Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n authorized homeopaths' proposition, but the political turmoil of the presidential succession prevented it from taking place. I n contrast to homeopaths reactions, C. Viesca y Lobat\u00f3n and F. Z\u00e1rraga, president and secretary of the AMM, congratulated President Obreg\u00f3n for his decision. See Alonso V.

He, Manuel Gea Gonz\u00e1lez, ENM's Dean, and Ezequiel A. Ch\u00e1vez, UNM's Chancellor, design ed this curriculum with no ENMH -faculty participation. A week later, Gast\u00e9lum submitted a new reformed curriculum for the ENM, which coincidentally was the same as the one proposed for the ENMH with the exception of the homeopathic courses (See Table 1, year 1920 -4, ENM, 1924). The University Council originally created a commission with two members from ENM faculty and the ENMH Dean to evaluate the new curriculum for the ENMH, but the new curriculum for the ENM demanded a bigger commission to evaluate both. Consequently the Council added the ENM secretary and the ENM Dean to the original commission, increasing the already unbalanced ENM -to-ENMH -faculty ratio.79 Political timing and professional antipathies also played an important role during these negotiations. Taking advantage of timing, the commission to evaluate c urricular reforms took three weeks to bring back its resolution to the University Council, and in the session of December 14, 1923, Gea Gonz\u00e1lez, president of the commission, requested an extra week to submit the final report .80 By early January 1924, when the University Council started to discuss the commission's report, the ENMH no longer existed as an independent institution in the university and consequently did not have representation in the council .81 Although the council 78 See Acts of the University Council, November 14th, 1923, in \"21a.

The commission's report empha sized that due to his absence at meeting s, the commission had had to analyze the new ENMH curriculum without any input from representatives of that school .83 Revolving around the prejudice that homeopaths rejected the unity of medical science when they offered medical training of their own, ENM f aculty proposed in their report that students of both medical degrees undertook the same courses on medical sciences and that special homeopathic courses were created for those who wanted to pursue the degree of homeopathic doctor. Such a plan still kept t he degree of homeopathic doctor as distinct from that of medical doctor even within the ENM, but the lack of activism of ENMH faculty and students within the University Council84 and their alignment with ENM faculty's ideology led to the merger of both curricula and degrees into one and turn ed homeopathy into a medical specialty. Despite the University Council's invitation, Porragas did not attend the sessions when the report was read and discussed .85 In contrast, Miguel F. Bachiller, ENMH's professor of micr obiology, and Abelardo Mart\u00edn Novelo, an ENMH student, did attend, but their opinions favored the 82 The proposal to consider the voice of ENMH faculty came from Dean Ezequiel A. Ch\u00e1vez. Gea Gonz\u00e1lez intervened to ratify that he would agreed on the proposition if ENMH faculty and students were allowed to offer their opinion but not to vote any resolution. Dean Ch\u00e1vez acknowledged that even if he wanted them to vote, that was not possible due to UNM legislation. 83 See Dictamination of the new study programs for undergraduate studies in Medicine and Homeopathy in \"Dictamen \", AHUNAM, CU, 13, 92, 1233. 84 ENMH faculty and students and other homeopathic organizations did pursued activism but not within the university. They rather addressed personally President Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n. Alonso V.

For instance, Miguel Bachiller believed in the \"uniqueness\" of medical scientific courses, in the \"scientific education of the youth\", and in the need to \"be first a scientific doctor\" before \"prescribing globules\".86 Students of homeopathy were concerned about studying at an institution where homeopathy raised profound antipathies and let Fernando Ocaranza, a member of the commission, know about their concern .87 Believing that such animosity might bring disciplinary problems within the ENM, Ocaranza seconded ENMH students' request for teaching homeopathy as a medical specialty in the Escuela Nacional de Altos Estudios [Gradu ate School], just like other medical specialties were taught. With no objections from the University Council, the commission decided to modify the original report, turning the ENM into the single medical school within the university responsible for training medical doctors. The seemingly consensual decision that unified medical training at the ENM and placed this school as the single institution that granted official medical degrees in Mexico City was a consequence of different trends in government adminis tration, the persistence of ENM faculty to use a unilateral view of science to monopolize state support and unify medical curricula and schools, and a shift in ENMH faculty 's perce ptions of homeopathic training . Central regulation started when D\u00edaz require d the ENMH to have the same curriculum as the ENM. Social and political revolts precluded the UNM from organizing and centraliz ing professional education, and when Vasconcelos resumed such efforts in 1920, the ENMH stood as a minor budget - consuming school in contrast to the ENM. ENM faculty took advantage of their institutional position to implement their plans to get rid of the ENMH and consolidate the ENM as the single official medical school. A new generation of homeopaths who had been trained jus t as their 86 See \" 33a. Sesi\u00f3n. \" 87 Both Abelardo Mart\u00edn Novelo and the Society of Students of the ENMH had addressed the University Chancellor and Fernando Ocaranza before the council's meeting to let them know this concern. 145 ENM peers appropriated the marginalizing discourse of ENM faculty, reducing homeopathy to a therapeutic system whose particular views of disease and the body were subsumed to modern scientific ones. Bachiller and Mart\u00edn Novelo's opinions show that EN MH faculty and students had forgotten ENMH 's original ideal of training the working class and instead appropriated the aspirations of medical elites .88 As such they aligned with administrative centralization, but detach ed from the revolutionary ideal of providing education to those who had no access to it. Porragas, his staff, and students aimed to participate in the professional, economic, and social benefits that ENM -graduated medical doctors enjoyed and that Vasconcelos so harshly criticized. In contrast, the ELHM brought medical training to those who could not study at the UNM, fulfilling the revolutionary ideal with which Vasconcelos was infusing the university. The ELHM received positive comments from different sector s of the society, from ministers to ENM graduates, from legislators to Supreme Court ministers . All of them praised the school's effort as a private institution which \"relieved the government from university education so it can dedicate its economic effort s to educate the masses who are less privileged to pursue academic studies\" ,89 as J. M Puig Casauranc, Vasconcelos' successor as Minister of the SEP, commented; or its organization, effort, and willingly action, despite their poor resources. As these commen ts, G\u00f3mez and Dozal's report, and Moreno' letter show, the EL MH was positioned as a medical 88 For instance, Godoy criticized ENMH graduates for changing adve rtisements outside their consulting offices to include a note that said they belong to school of the UNM. Godoy \u00c1lvarez, \"Con motivo de la Homeopat\u00eda en el Departamento Universitario,\" 3. 89 Francois -Flores gathered a series of positive comments to the ELHM in \"El Libro de Oro\" in Francois - Flores, La Escuela Libre de Homeopat\u00eda 15 - 18. These comments came from Carlos B. Zetina (1918), J. M Puig Casauranc, Dr. J. Castro of Hospital Ju\u00e1rez , 1924), Dr. Carlos Meneses (Head of the and Hospital Morelos , Luis 1924), (President of Supreme Court, (allopath doctor, 1926), Legisla tor Benjam\u00edn Aguill\u00f3n (1926), Legislator E.

While the ENMH tried to cope with curricular, methodological, and material improvements that the ENM's model of medical training demanded, the ELHM sustained its own pedagogical methodology and particular view of medicine that earned it positive appraisals. Higinio Perez's beliefs in orthodox homeopathy, a non -encyclopedic training, and a focus on practice, made him purportedly leave the school's methodology practically unchanged for practically 20 years, remaining true to his belief that \"the pure Hahnemannian orthodoxy [...] is what we need for the evolutionary progress and development of science, because it is proved and it is a natural law that the hybrid is sterile\" .90 At a time when the ENM criticized the very existence of the ENMH arguing the impossibility of teach ing scientific courses from a homeopathic perspective, the ELHM's director condemned the \"official\" school 's old and routine method that formed \"erudite\" professionals who could not heal patients ' ailments . In the brochure that explained the curricul ar changes in 1925, he displayed the characteristics that made his medical school distinctive. He plainly and openly opposed \"official\" medical training. His curriculum and pedagogic methodology emphasized a low course load, providing only the indispensabl e theoretical content. Instead professors gave students elements that prepared them to do their own research and find answers to their own medical inquiries. The core of Higinio's approach was the human being; \"the healthy man is and will always be the mea sure and base of comparison in all medical speculation\", he wrote.91 Higinio P\u00e9rez's rhetoric attempted to disqualify science -based medical training at the ENM by turning upside down ENM's faculty 90 Higinio P\u00e9rez's exortation to his y preparatoria anexa,\" (J. L. Mu\u00f1oz, 1925), vol., 3 -11. 147 own discourse. What for the latter seemed modern and scienti fic medicine, i.e. microbiology and physiology, for the former was no more than a medical training that missed the focus of medicine. What for the latter seemed advanced laboratory practices, for the former was no more than routinarian observations that mi ssed the key of medical training, the patient . By placing ELHM's pedagogical approach over ENM's, Higinio P\u00e9rez put the former in competition with the latter, ideologically turning the ELHM into what ENM's faculty was trying to get rid of at the UNM in 192 4. Regardless of its pedagogic methodology, ELHM's curricular structure did change from 1913 to 1933 (See Table 1), increasingly resembling ENM's by 1933. With new reforms, P\u00e9rez added courses on b asic and medical sciences such p harmacopeia, biochemistry, and bacteriology, in 1925, and physiotherapy, psychiatry, parasitology and physiological pathology, in 1933. These courses had generally been first included by t he ENM, though others, such as p hysiotherapy and hygiene, had first been included in homeopathic curricula. The ELHM offered more courses in therapeutics and fewer in clinical practices and courses of specialization than the ENM, though it had extended the time -span for medical studies to five years. But as with former reforms, the similar structure differed in terms of extent, or in other words, how many courses were dedicated to each topic. While these differences were justified by Higinio's particular training perspective, they also indicate d his own tendency to equate the ELHM's acad emic curriculum with the ENM's. These differences were less radical compared to the ones of the early 1910s, and would become even less distinctive in the 1930s. The convergence of all medical academic curricula offered by medical schools in Mexico City in the 1930s suggests a general acknowledgment, regardless of doctrinarian views, that medical doctors, homeopaths and allopaths alike, needed to acquire a set of concepts and skills before they could be considered professional practitioners. 148 Differences sti ll existed in terms of amount of courses dedicated to a particular subject, but in terms of structure medical academic curricula were mainly the same. This confluence in the structure of medical schools' academic curricula in Mexico City was a consequence of a new reconfiguration of the role of the state and the UNM in professional education at the turn of the 1930s. The ELHM achieved in the 1910s and the 1920s what the ENMH could not during the Porfiriato and the first three decades of the 20th century. It turned into a medical school that offered training to those who could not afford an elite education at state institutions, shifting the locus where homeopathic doctors were trained in Mexico City. It seemed that the sectarian and uplifting eth os and a working -class orientation with which Higinio P\u00e9rez imbued his medical school attracted a larger and more committed student population, at least during the 1920s .92 The ELHM graduated more students even after the ENMH was incorporated into the UNM : 22 and 10, respectively , in 1924 (See Graph 1). The rate of graduation at the ELHM remained fairly constant (13 graduates per year) without significant variations from 1916 to 1938. The ENMH's rate of graduation was 3.5 from 1895 to 1924 and 7.1 from 1928 to 1936 (See Graph 1) \u2014 clearly lower than the ELHM's. During the 1920s, the ELHM became the main provider of homeopathic doctors for Mexico City and the whole country, and from 1924 to 1928, the only provider . These figures changed in the 1930s. While the ELHM's graduation rate remained steady , and its graduates still remained the most important group of homeopathic doctors in the country throughout the 1940s, a new wave of state support reinsta ted the ENMH in an effort to provide medical training to the w orking class at the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN). Eventually this lead the ENMH to restore its original position during the Porfiriato as the second 92 Analysis of transcripts of the ELHM in the AHELHM. 149 most important school in Mexico City in terms of the quality of its facilities, the amount of fundi ng received, and the number of students graduated . \"Buil[t] up on indestructible foundations\": The Struggle to Introduce Scientific Medicine in SEP-Administered Homeopathic Medical Schools, 1928 -36 The presidential succession of 1928 and the Maximato (1928-34) brought a series of drastic institutional rearrangements that impacted homeopathic schools. In the course of eight years, the ENMH was re -insta ted as an official medical school (1928), the SEP -regulated free schools ' and ELHM's medical degrees became official (1930), and the ENMH became a founding school of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN) (1936), a socialist project to bring professional education to the working -class initiated during the L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rde nas pres idential period (1934 -40). The volatile situation of homeopathic schools reflected tensions between the state and the UNM that resulted in the displacement of the university as the regulatory office of professional education under SEP's control. From 1910 to 1925 the National University served the needs of the state, as when it incorporated the ENMH, it closed the National School of High Studies, or when Vasconcelos denied funds for a new building for the ENM. Its position within the SEP placed it over othe r professional schools ,93 but also subjected it to SEP's own budgetary, administrative, and academic policies .94 By the end of the 1920s UNM's secondary role within 93 For instance, during Calles administration (1924 -1928), he provided legisl ation that subsumed free schools under the rule of the university. In order to make their degrees legal, the UNM needed to evaluate and validate free schools' academic curricula. Otherwise graduates from free schools needed to pass an examination in the un iversity in order to receive titles from it. See section VIII in the report from the office of medical demography in the \"INFOMRE DEL DEPARTAMENTO DE SALUBRIDAD DE 1925.\", in the A HSS, SP, S, 9, 15. 94 With Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos as Dean (1920 -4), the University became a tool to develop the nationalistic and revolutionary project of providing basic education to the entire nation, which meant the mobilization of a huge amount of material and human resources to the c ountryside in order to reach the most economically underserved sectors of the population. But professional education remained elitist and liberal; elitist, for only the affluent sectors of the society, many of them living in urban centers, especially in Me xico City, could afford this type of education, and liberal because it believed in its own academic and administrative self-governance. See Javier Mendoza Rojas, Los conflictos de la UNAM en el siglo XX , Colecci\u00f3n 150 the SEP reached a point of rupture and led to a conflict that concluded with the Portes Gil administration (1928 -30) granting the university autonomy .95 With its autonomy earned, the university turned into a professional institution similar to the other professional schools that existed in Mexico City, at least in administrative terms, for it stop ped working as the regulatory center of professional education in the city. The new UNM's Organic Law proposed to gradually turn this institution into a private one without \"any right to impose its criteria in the evaluation of free and private institution s that offered education similar to the one the university provided\".96 Moreover, article 37 explicitly gave the responsibility to regulate free schools, validate their curricula, and legalize their titles to the President of Mexico and the SEP .97 This radic al shift brought regulation back to free schools, including the ELHM, in Mexico City. Regulation of free schools was a political issue to undermine UNM status rather than an effort to improve education at these schools. While turning them into \"official\" i nstitutions implied that the state was responsible for regulat ing their curricul a and the way they functioned ,98 the state did not provide any funds to cope with these schools' material needs.

This history developed throughout the 1920s and 1930s, sometimes through faculty demands, and sometimes through students' congresses or protests. In 1928 new projects to attain the a utonomy were proposed, one by a students' association and the other by the rector, Alfonso Pruneda, but none of them succeeded. In 1929, once Emilio Porte s Gil took office, a minor conflict between university students and authorities escalated to the point where the public force surreptitiously infiltrated the university campus, confronting a group of students that manifested against them. President Portes G il's overreaction was caused by the political struggles between the ruling party and the party led by Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos, the one student leaders supported. The conflict turned into a general strike which Portes Gil solved by giving the National University i ts autonomy.

See Francois -Flores, La Escuela Libre de 151 President Portes Gil initiated the regulation of free schools af ter he solved the conflict with the UNM. The SEP positively evaluated medical studies at the ELHM during this transition , and while the school suffered from some infrastructural deficiencies in the s urgery room and needed to meet specific hygienic requirem ents, the SEP believed that it would be ready to provide adequate medical training once it improved its condition .99 The decree that regulated the ELHM on January 1930 stated that the school could \"freely formulate its curriculum, programs, and teaching met hods; but in order to modify the ones currently used it most notify the SEP\" ,100 though it imposed a curricular structure. Just as D\u00edaz did almost three decades earlier with the ENMH, this decree listed the courses that each student needed to take in order to obtain a homeopathic medical degree, but on this occasion, these courses followed the ELHM curriculum of 1925 rather than the ENM's. Besides requiring the school to graduate students in no less than 4 years, the decree imposed no more regulations. Homeopat\u00eda 89-95.

While these reforms preserved t he school's particular view of medicine and homeopathy, the slight change in the thematic content indicated a shift towards introducing basic sciences and medical specialties into the curriculum and using such changes to publicize the ELHM as a modern medi cal school. A pamphlet that publicized the school in 1935 preserved the same view regarding homeopathy, pedagogic methodology, and curricular structure with which Higinio P\u00e9rez advertised the ELHM in the early 1920s .101 Yet pictures highlighted the school's modern facilities, in contrast to the ones it offered in the late 1920s (See Figure 2 ). These photographs represented ELHM facilities 101 \"Escuela Libre de de M\u00e9xico\", M\u00e9xico, D. F., 1935. AHELHM. p. 4-6. Figure 2.

These images and the courses offered in the curriculum of 1933 show that despite its particular view of medicine, ELHM adapted its curricular structure and facilities to provide its students with modern scientific know ledges and practices that benefited their everyday medical practice. Other situations influenced the adoption of a scientific rhetoric to s howcase the ELHM to the public as a medical school that offered modern medical training. Among these were a shift in leadership and a a large discrediting campaign during the early years of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas' administration , mounted by ENM graduates against homeopaths in the context of a new effort to reg ulate professions (See chapter 6 ). Higinio P\u00e9rez died in October 1929, and first -generation graduates headed the school during the 1930s. This new generation of homeopathic doctors as their doctrinaire peers from the ENMH adopted medical science and displayed in the ELHM curriculum and pamphlets to place this medical sc hool as a modern professional vis-\u00e0-vis the other two medical schools in Mexico City, the ENM and the ENMH , in the early 1930s . The political turmoil during the Maximato also resulted in the re -instatement of the ENHM as a state -sponsored option to train homeopathic doctors .102 The transformation of homeopathy from a distinct major into a medical specialty did not help homeopathy endure within the UNM in 1924. ENM faculty designed the specialty's curricular content, eliminating all doctrin aire content from i t, though ENMH graduates were responsible for teach ing the specialty .103 However, the specialty did not last longer than a year .104 Calles' 1928 decree argued 102 See \"Decreto por el cual establece 103 Pharmacopo eia, Pharmacodynamics, Homeopathic Therapy, and Philosophy of Medicine Especially of Homeopathy were the courses that finally constituted the specialty's curriculum, substituting, Materia medica and Homeopathic Doctrine, original courses which provided the core ideology of homeopathy. 154 that \"the way in which the [UNM] decided how to teach Homeopathic Medicine neither facilitated nor or iented students enrolled in the [ENM] towards homeopathy, which resulted in the total lack of homeopathy students at this school.\"105 This might seem contradictory to Bachiller and Novelo's position in 1924, which contributed to the fate of the ENMH within t he UNM. But the homeopathic community in general wanted the homeopathic school to thrive as an independent institution. At the time of the merger, faculty and students sought support from foreign and national homeopathic institutions, which responded offer ing venues through which ENMH students could continue studying at a homeopathic medical school .106 Consequently, This shift framed homeopathy as a pharmaceutical specialty, a particular way of ministering drugs, rather than a medical approach with its own particular view of medicine.

Letter from the Dean to ENAE faculty on December 31, 1924, AHUNAM, ENAE, 6, 115. 105 Homeopathic students also acknowledge this situation. For instance Manuel Cece\u00f1a Quiroz bitterly complained about the lack of awareness of homeopathic theories by ENM's professors when he studied medicine in the mid -1920s, and he remembered their constant mocking of homeopathy during his years as student. (agosto, 1936), p. 7 -8. 106 For instance, the Medical -Homeopathic Society of Yucat\u00e1n received a letter from A. Harkness, Secretary of the Board of Medical Education of the American Institute of Homeopathy, where he asked for information about the closure of the school and if there was anything he could do to re -establish the school or open a new one. \"We are very anxious to build up our schools, and to assist those in need\", he said. But the society knew neither the reaso ns of the annexation nor the way in which the American association could cooperate. , \"Una comunicaci\u00f3n del \"American ENMH students asked for information to finish their studies in the recently opened 155 Calles ' decree aimed to offer homeopathic medical training at the SEP, something the UNM did not do. The decree updated the ENMH curriculum (see Table 1), and placed the school under SEP's regulation, but it also left the school with no economic support at the National Homeopathic Hospital (HNH). While leaving the control of the ENMH to the SEP reproduced Vasconcelos' strategy of centralizing state -supported professional education, placing the school at the HNH reproduced the conditions that ha mpered the homeopathic school's material, curricular, and pedagogic development during the Porfiriato .

While the HNH offered its wards for the school's practical classes ,107 there were no cadaver s for the classes of descriptive anatomy and dissections ,108 and it lacked modern laboratory instruments to train students in basic sciences .109 107 The Head of the National Homeopathic Hospital, Joaqu\u00edn Segura y Pesado informed the General Director of Publi c Welfare that the students started having class, fulfilling Calles' decree.

In response, students and professors initiated a series of denunciations, which authorities ' reports corroborated, about how for the sake of his own particular benefit G\u00f3mez Esparza's monopolistic administrative practices attempted to \"deviate from the hospital's specific medical approach\" , that is, to support surgical rather than homeopathic therapeutic interventions .111 the Head of the Office of Public Welfare, May 28, 1929 and July 9, 1929, in AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 4, 4, p. 2 and 5. 109 A report from the Head of the Medical Department of the Office of Publi c Welfare stated that he had reports about the undesirable workings of the school.

The Department took the decision in spite of the undesirable state of the ward b ecause the head of the hospital requested funds in 1930 to pay for two experienced and \"technically proficient\" surgeons to attend the Maternity ward surgery room. Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3mez Esparza attempted to solve this problem by taking care of the surgery room of the Maternity Ward himself and requesting the removal of the other surgeon and the dismissal of practitioners who were students of the ENMH. s/f, in AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 4, 12, pp. 9 -15. 111 Correspondence from Carlos Moreno, Dr. Lugo, Dr. Francisco Eguiluz, and other homeopath to the Head of the Office of Public Welfare, AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 4, 12, p. 4 Isa\u00edas Joaqu\u00edn Priego, Efra\u00edn L\u00f3pez M. and Carlos Montfort R. to the Head of the Office of Public Welfare, March 7, 1930, AHSS , BP, EH, HNH, 4, 14, p. 10 -2.

While there are reasons to believe that he mismanaged school's funds115 and created group of interest within the HNH ,116 these accusations must be taken cautiously. There were students who argued that half of the sixteen students enrolled in the scho ol in 1930 were exempt from school fees and the other half did not pay fees 114 According to the students' letter and oth er documents, students paid 30 pesos for enrolling fees, 10 pesos each month for tuition, and 20 pesos for examination, making a total of 150 pesos a year.

Originally in 1895, the hospital' s medical staff did not receive salary. At a certain point during the 1920s, both medical staff and practitioners started receiving a stipend. In 1930, physicians and practitioners received 3 and 2 (pesos?) a day, respectively. AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 4, 15, p. 8.

These students' denunciations mo st likely responded to their concern when they feel their source of income threatened. Consequently, they might have overreacted in their statements. Yet, while G\u00f3mez Esparza and Porragas might have not mismanaged ENMH medical student fees, they might have done it with ENMH nursing student fees. Plutarco El\u00edas Calles' decree authorized the creation of a nursing school within the ENMH. Rather than ENMH medical students, it seemed that nursing ones paid fees without receiving a degree after fulfilling all req uirements. The latter said they had paid $150 pesos in total and had not received their degree. See \"Hacen graves cargos contra un secretario. BP, EH, HNH, 4, 17, 8, p. 11; see also a letter from a nurse in AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 4, 24, p. 23, and 25 -6. G\u00f3mez Esparza acknowledged having received such payments, but made clear that nursing students had \"failed their exams or had not fulfilled the req uirements to be examined.\" See \"La escuela In in AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 4, 17, 8, p. 11. Further accusations of corruption came in 1932. These exposed G\u00f3mez Esparza as a person who stole medical material from the homeopathic hospital to use it in his private clinic. Moreover, nurses and administrative personnel accused him of using the hospital's surgery room for his private patients. See letters from nursing students and medical staff of the homeopathic hospital in AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 4, 24, pp. 24, 26, and 27. 116 Members of the Association of Surgeons of the National Homeopathic Hospital (see note 105) did not complain about G\u00f3mez Esparza's surgical tendencies. Moreover, they believed that his interventions were motivated by hi s desire to improve the hospital and provide a better service to patients. See Correspondence from the hospital staff to Mos\u00e9s S\u00e1enz, head of the Board of Public Welfare, on March 4, 1930, AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 4, 25, p. It was other doctors (Carlos Moreno, D r.

In contrast to the early 1910s, lack of funding and differences in the medical/therapeutic approach placed the ENMH in a worse position in the early 1930s. At least in the late 1910s the homeopathic community at state homeopathic institutions was united. In the 1930s the conflict was located within homeopathic institutions and am ong ENMH graduates and students (G\u00f3mez Esparza graduated from the ENMH in 1923). G\u00f3mez Esparza's reforms might have been we ll intended, but his opinions negatively impacted the school. For instance, echoing G\u00f3mez Esparza 's declarations, a journalist commented that \"a school of medicine which lacks microscopes to actually see bacteria, microtomes to do histological preparations , haematocytometers to count red cells in blood samples, or dyes to find out the presence of the tuberculosis bacillus, should not exist.\" He also believed that the \"faculty is naturally deficient since they do not receive a salary, and students have a poo r quality because they are rejects from other schools\".119 In contrast to students' attitude s in the University's Council in 1924, this new generation actively protested against G\u00f3mez Esparza's reforms which diver ged from homeopathy and opposed the original intention for which the hospital was created. Taking advantage of the 117 \"Los doctor es G\u00f3mez Esparza y Porragas no Tienen la Culpa del Desbarajus te.\" Newspaper cut in AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 4, 7, p. 8 -11. 118 \"Los doctor es G\u00f3mez Esparza y Porragas no Tienen \"La eficiencia en los estudios m\u00e9dicos\", September 20, 1930, newspaper cut, in AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 4, 17, pp. 8 -11. 161 unprecedented role of students in achieving the UNM's autonomy and enjoying the support of the Federation of Students of the Federal District, E NMH students threatened to go on strike. It is unclear to what extent a strike in a school that did not receive state funds and had only 14 enrolled students might have exerted any political pressure to government authorities. But this threat suggests students' political involvement in attracting economic support to their medical school. Students' denunciations produced G\u00f3mez Esparza's destitution as secretary of the school in 1930, though he remained as head of the homeopathic hospital. A year later Porrag as was destituted as dean of the school .120 With Fidel de Regules leading the ENMH, faculty and students continued protesting against G\u00f3mez Esparza's marginalizing attitudes at the HNH ,121 until in 1932 a new administration brought a new leader to the National Homeopathic Hospital .122 Even if G\u00f3mez Esparza left the homeopathic hospital as a consequence of a change 120 Correspondence from ENMH students to the President of the Public Welfare, July 20, 1931, in AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 4, 17, p. 1 -2. 121 Correspondence from Dr. Alejandro Cerisela, vice minister of the SEP, to D.

Students' protests also exposed G\u00f3mez Esparza's corruption at the National Homeopathic Hospital in 1932. 122 Apparently, G\u00f3mez Esparza enjoyed the President's support. From 1930 to 1932, authorities acknowledged the problem of having two approaches to medicine and therapy at the n ational homeopathic hospital. Some reports advised a clear division of staff and their specific job duties in surgical rooms and homeopathic dispensaries or consulting rooms.

Other reports recommended closing the surgical wards of the hospital and turning this institution into a homeopathic dispensary; some of these reports recommended dismissing G\u00f3mez Esparza and giving the hospital a truly homeopathic approach.

Moreover, G\u00f3mez Esparza cynically replied to students and authorities' requests to open spaces in the homeopathic hospital for the practice and teaching of homeopat hic medicine saying that the hospital \"has been, is, and will always be\" open to ENMH students and faculty. See correspondence between Dr. Fidel de R\u00e9gules, ENMH Dean, Francisco Ortiz Rubio, President of Public Welfare, Dr. Alejandro Cerisela, vice ministe r of the SEP, Ricardo V\u00e9rtiz, head of the Medical Department of Public Welfare, Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3mez 162 in government administration, the conflict showed students' ability to organiz e politically , though the conflict's resolution was not entirely a conseq uence of such organization. G\u00f3mez Esparza's departure did not improve ENMH facilities. Even with Fidel de R\u00e9gules at the helm , the school was an institution in Calles' decree, but not in the real world . Despite the change in government administration, de R\u00e9gules received no support from the SEP in 1932 ; \"not ev en a chair where [he] could sit \", he said.123 His house hosted the school, but first graders stopped attending and second and third graders were thinking to do the same for it resulted expensive to att end classes at each of the professors' own residencies. Two years later, a SEP report cited in a special issue of Acci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica , the Journal of the Union of Medical Doctors of Mexico City, indicated that the school was still hosted at de R\u00e9gules residence, that the school's library had only \"three books of white homeopathic magic, an anatomy by Higinio P\u00e9rez, and lacked archives\", and that facilities included only 14 deteriorated benches, 11 deteriorated chairs, 1 desk, and 1 microscope .124 Whether this was a transcription of the r eport or not, the tone is suggestive of how SEP inspectors or ENM graduates perceived ENMH facilities at the time. But even the description was exaggerated, or despite SEP authorities or homeopathy detractors' opinion, these numbers indicate that the ENMH lacked the essential elements to provide medical education. Its situation was even worse than ELHM's when it started in 1912. ENMH's conditions led the SEP to temporally stop issuing medical degrees to ENMH graduates and close the sc hool, but eventually student activism aligned it with new President Esparza, and the President of the Board of Public Health, from July 27 to October 20, 1931, AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 4, 17, p. 12 -7. 123 Dr. de R\u00e9gules complained to Franci sco Ortiz Rubio, head of Public Welfare, and apparently the President's brother, that the SEP's minister promised him all the material and moral support .

Being governed by ENM graduates, the office did not support the ENMH's growth. The offices ' head even denied medical degrees to ENMH's students who had already passed their final examinations in 1933. The closure of the school in 1934 motivated the recently created Asocicaci\u00f3n de Estudiantes de Homeopat\u00eda del Distrito Federal [Association of Homeopathic Students of the Federal District] to seek political support with the Student Federation of Technical Schools .126 The connection of these two societies placed the ENMH in a social, political, and institutional context that resulted in the school's obtaining long-term state support. In 1935, the Minister of the SEP placed the homeopathic school under the Office of Technical Education. A year later, this office organized SEP's technica l schools into the National Polytechnic Institute, an institution that professionalized vocational education during the C\u00e1rdenas presidential term. State support brought resources that drastically improved ENMH's facilities in the late 1930s. In 1939, the National Polytechnic Institute showcased ENMH's modern and scientific facilities which promised prospective students to be trained in lab sciences such as biochemistry (See Figure 5 ), bacteriology, parasitology, histology, physiology (See Figure 6), and pharmacy , and medical sciences such as anatomy, surgery, internal medicine, obstetri cs, and gynecology (See Figure 7 ).127 In turn, the school attracted a larger student population. During the 1930s the school graduated 7.9 students per year, more than double the number it graduated in the 1910s or even when the SEP funded it (1920 -4) (See Graph 1). Moreover, its rate of graduation almost 125 This brief recount of the situation of the ENMH within the SEP is taken from Escuela Nacional de Medicina Homeop\u00e1tica 29-34.; and Francois Flores, la homeopat\u00eda en M\u00e9xico 61-65. 126 Carlos Montfort, the student t hat led students ' mobilizations in the conflict with Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3mez Esparza, led this new mobilization in 1933 -4. 127 Escuela Nacional de Medicina Homeop\u00e1tica . 164 paralleled the ELHM's (9.9 students per year in the 1930s). E NMH 's curricular structure was essentially the same as the ELHM in 1939 (See Table 1), indicating that the SEP's intervention provided a shared curricular structure in all medical schools regulated by this government institution. Like ELHM, the ENMH's curricular thematic content reflected that of the ENM, though it of fered fewer courses in each topic and on medical specialties. The confluence of the curricular structure and the display of modern and scientific facilities in both SEP -administered homeopathic medical schools points to the tools used by L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas' a dministration to fulfill the promises of the revolution and to bring modern medical training to the working class. Figure 5. \" Students Taking Their Class in the Laboratory of Biochemistry\" at the National School of Homeopathic Medicine 1939 ),pp.48. 165 Conclusion The state regulation of homeopathic medical schools took almost half a century to achieve . The difficulties that Mexican governments faced in controlling one of the most powerful professional groups in the first half of the 20th century resulted from the contradictions between opposing medical doctrines, class i nterests, and different government administrations. Homeopathic medical training was not drastically different from that provided by the ENM, neither during the Porfiriato nor after 1910. But the struggle for state support made ENM graduates and authoritie s frame homeopathy as a \"bifurcation of science\" and the ENMH as a second -class medical school that provided poor medical training. While orthodox homeopathy offered an alternative view of the human body with a particular approach to therapeutic interventi on in contrast to the one offered at the ENM, it did not precluded homeopathic medical schools from providing adequate medical training. Rather, orthodox homeopathy offered an ideology around which students and faculty united to fight for their right to ac cess professional medical training, in the case of the ELHM, and state support, in the case of the ENMH. In other words, homeopathic ideology in itself did not preclude an adequate medical training. The divisionary and marginalizing discourse of ENM gradua tes aimed to monopolize state resources and turn public opinion to their side. But because of political enmities or convictions, state authorities acknowledged the importance of homeopathic medical schools as independent institutions that needed regulation and support. Ironically, despite the state's recognition of homeopathic school's institutional independence from the UNM and despite the doctrinarian differences and ideologies endorsed by homeopathic schools, state support and regulation 166 implied acknowle dgment of medical science as a tool and a sign of modern medical training and medical progress by homeopathic medical schools .128 The regulation of homeopathic medical schools occurred in a period of radical social transformations that were reflected in the creation of new forms to bring medical training to the working class. The creation of the ENMH is a s ymbol of the privileged pos ition of elite physicians during the Porfiriato , and the discussions about ENMH representing a bifurcation of science were no more than ENM elite physicians' complains about losing Porfirio D\u00edaz's unilateral support. While originally the ENMH intended to s olve the problem of irregular homeopathic healers in Mexico City, it actually provided homeopathic medical training to social elites and did so throughout the 1910s and 20s. The conflict within the UNM was but an extension of the Porfirian conflict among m edical elites. The social upheaval after D\u00edaz's de feat in 1910 introduced a model of medical education that actually addressed working -class needs. The struggle between ELHM and ENM graduates took place in the arena of the regulation of professional medica l practice (that I will analyze in chapter 4 and 5). But ELHM 's recognition as a worth y medical school by state authorities and the increasing rate of professional homeopathic medical doctors that it graduated placed the ELHM as a working -class institution that competed with the elite ENM. Moreover, while the shift toward regulating free schools and reinsta ting the ENMH was originally a political revenge against the UNM for not complying with Calles' interests, in the long run it also signaled an institutio nal path that C\u00e1rdenas used to provide professional training for the working class while centralizing its regulation . The revolution 128 Ana Mar\u00eda Carrillo's arguments about the tensions between professional autonomy and state regulation during the 19th century extended to the first half of the 20th century. She argues that though with its relationship with the state the medical profession gained political power over the rest of the health professions, the state was not consequential with the medical profession's monopolistic desires. This applies to homeopathy and its alternative view of homeopathy in homeopathic medical schools. Carrillo, \"M\u00e9dicos del M\u00e9xico decimon\u00f3nico: entre el control estatal y la autonom\u00eda profesional.\" 167 turned an elitist effort to train irregular homeopathic practitioners during the Porfiriato into two medical schools that o ffered medical training to the working class during and after L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas' presidential term. In a larger perspective, the state's regulation of homeopathic medical schools during the first half of the 20th century aimed to centralize curricular, administrative, and political control. Every wave of r egulation centered its efforts o n standardizing the academic curriculum of homeopathic schools, following the ENM's model during the Porfiriato and at the UNM, and the ELHM's model in the 1930s under SEP's regulation. This division resulted from the split between the SEP and the UNM as regulating institutions at the turn of the 1930s. As I will Figure 6. \" Diagnostic Inoculations \" and \" Serological Research \" at the National School of Homeopathic Medicine Nacional, 1939 ),pp.52. 168 analyze in chapter 4, the state retained con trol of the medical profession by creating a central agency of licensing in the 1930s ,129 though each institution retained control over its own curricul um. This tendency was but a generalization of what happened at the local level. The state created and regu lated homeopathic medical schools as schools independent from government offices that regulated the ENM. In this sense, while state intervention regulated medical curricula, it diversified medical schools. This diversification had consequences within stat e funded homeopathic institutions, as exemplified by the fate of the ENMH during the 1920s. Dependence on the state's budget threatened this school's own existence, and like the ENM, the ENMH's fate depended on the politics of the state. In contrast, the E LHM did not depend on the state as a training institution, and state policies did not impact its institutional life as such during the 1910s, 20s and early 30s.130 Politically, homeopathic medical schools adapted to the changing interests of the state from the Porfiriato to revolutionary governments. While the ENMH a dapted to policies that favored social elites, medical science, and top -down approaches to the regulation of medical practices during the Porfiriato , the ELHM and eventually the ENMH in the earl y 1930s a dapted to the revolutionary state rhetoric of providing education to the working class. By becoming a bottom -up model for medical training, homeopathic medical schools also turned into a coin for political exchange. The ELHM functioned as a counte rweight to the immense political power that the ENM had at the UNM during the Maximato , and the ENMH served C\u00e1rdenas' program 129 See also chapter 1 in Julio Moreno, Yankee Don't Go Home! : Mexican Nationalism, American Business Culture, and the Shaping of Modern Mexico, 1920 -1950 , The Luther H artwell Hodges Series on Business, Society, and the State (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2003). 130 When L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas aimed to centralize homeopathic medical training at the SEP, he aimed to turn back the regulation of the ELHM and clos e it down. But students and faculty won a lawsuit against the president's intentions and stopped his intentions. The president actually decreed its closure on December 16, 1938. Francois -Flores, La Escuela Libre de Homeopat\u00eda 111-5. 169 to centralize and professionalize technical education. Regardless of the threat that shifting state policies meant to these school s' existence, they were able to endure, showing that \"the homeopathic medical doctor lived identified with the caste of those unredeemed whom the Mexican Revolution sublimes into the purest ideal and shelters under its flag.\"131 131 \"Importancia de medicina homeop\u00e1tica Homeop\u00e1tica 35-6. Figure 7. \"A Class of Surgical Clinics \" and \"A Detail of the Class of Obstetrical Clinics \" at the National School of Homeopathic Medicine Chapter 4 . Contending the \"Fifth Plague\": Medical Degrees, Medical Practice, and the Politics to Sanitize the Medical Profession, 1910 -34 On December 4, 1936, Antonio P\u00e9rez Alcocer, head of the Departamento de Salubridad [Department of Public Health , hereon DSP] Office of Legal Affairs, reported how difficult it was for the sanitary department to enforce the sections of the Sanitary Code that aimed to regulate medical practice . The lawyer was con cerned because the contradiction between the Constitution of 1917 and the Sanitary Code obliged his office to register medical degrees without certifying if the schools that issued them provided proper medical training. In his report, he asked: How could t he Department of Public Health itself be held responsible [of the rights of the Mexican Society] under such circumstances, if it had to register a crowd of titles issued in an illegal or fraudulent way by the States of the Republic [sic], where there are n ot even establish ments of secondary instruction?1 P\u00e9rez Alcocer's report evidences the frustrations of sanitary authorities in their attempts to regulate medical practice during the first decades of the sanitary dictatorship. His was not an isolated opinion. Even after two reforms to the Sanitary Code, in 1926 and 1934, Alfonso Pruneda, former head of the DSP Office of Legal Affairs, believed that the \"campaign against charlatanism\" needed to be carried out with more intensity through all possible mea ns, suggesting that improvements in the later call fell short on what was required .2 The way he described these limitations suggests that he believed sanitary authorities coped well with the problem of practitioners who lacked a title, but that those who i ndeed had it were more dangerous and needed closer attention. 1 See \"Estudio formulado por el jefe December 4, 1936; correspondence from Antonio Perez Alcocer to the head of the DSP, in AHSS, SP, P, S, 14, 5. 2 Alfonso Pruneda read his opinion in the National Academy of Medicine on February 20, 1935. See Alfonso Pruneda, \"El Nuevo 400 -01. 171 This problem was not new. Academic physicians had been aiming to control the practice of medicine during the 19th century by making the possession of a state -issued medical degree the legal requ irement to participate in the institutional life of the emerging bureaucratic Porfirian state.3 Yet the liberality of the Constitution of 1857, the strong federalism, and the poor presence of academically trained physicians in the capital, in other urban c enters, and in the countryside did not mean that sanitary authorities enforced the sanitary law in Mexico City or that the states adopted, let alone implemented, such regulations .4 These led, as Claudia Agostoni has pointed 3 A hygienic city, with high life expectancy and a reduced mortali ty rate became part of the political discourse about progress and modernity during the Porfiriato . As a consequence, D\u00edaz's regime used the Sanitary Board of Health to promote a series of projects to turn Mexico into an international example of sanitary in tervention. The Board issued the first sanitary code of independent Mexico in 1891. Besides sanitary regulations, the code established clear rules on the registration of medical titles and the provision of death certificates. Accordingly, all practitioners were required to notify the Board or the local authority about their activities and their consulting offices' addresses. Physicians with a medical degree who lived in Mexico City were required to register their degrees, while those who lived in other stat es could do it at their own will. The code allowed issuing death certificates only to registered physicians who were entitled to refuse this obligation when they found signs of an unnatural cause of death. Practitioners who lacked a medical degree needed t o request a death certificate from a local coroner. Infringements to these regulations were considered a minor fault and received a fine between 5 and 100 Mexican pesos. Due to the limited jurisdiction of the Superior Board or Health, these specific regula tions were restricted to the Federal District -which included Mexico City and neighboring territories - and the federal territories of Colima and Baja California. During the rest of the Porfiriato and the armed phase of the revolution (1891 - 1917), the Super ior Board of Health neither actualized any regulations related to the registry of titles or the issuing of death certificates in the sanitary code, nor created any office that controlled medical practice based on the contemporary legislation. The Sanitary Code suffered reforms in 1894 and 1903, but none of them modified the original regulation of medical practice of the one of 1891.See Agostoni, Monuments of Progress: Modernization and Public Health in Mexico City, 1876 -1910 .; also see \"Ejercicio de la medicina en sus diferentes ramos.\" Sanitary Code of the Mexican United States.

Cited in \u00c1lvarez Am\u00e9zquita, Bustamante and Fern\u00e1ndez del Castillo, Historia de la salubridad y de la asistencia en Mexico 373-79. 4 For instance, homeopaths such as Ram\u00f3n Comellas and Jos\u00e9 Carb\u00f3, enjoying the support of President Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Ana, were able to able to enter the medical registry in the 1850s, against the opposition of sanitary authorities. W hile they arguably had academic training in medicine, they did not comply with the requirements that sanitary authorities imposed, for instance passing an examination by the School of Medicine's faculty. For the 1859 medical registry where Comellas and dentistas, flebotomianos, y parteras,\" Ana issued a title to Jos\u00e9 Carb\u00f3 on December 6, 1854, so he could practice specifically homeopathic medicine. AHSS, SP, EM, 3, 63. Ram\u00f3n Comella's request to the Superior Board of Health to register his title is in AHENM, CSS, 30, 6, pp. 2 -3. Jos\u00e9 Carb\u00f3's petition to practice medicine in the Mexican Republic is in AHENM, CSS, 31, 1, pp. 1 -4. The Superior Board of Health described the legal situation of homeopaths in correspondence with the governor of Mexico City, July 3, 1855 and July 13, 172 out, to the proliferation of ill egal medical practitioners during the Porfiriato .5 These practitioners were in the majority of cases unlicensed practitioners, i.e. those who did not have a medical or other type of professional degree. Though there were a small group of licensed practitio ners who contested sanitary authority, like midwives, pharmacists and dentists, the y were eventually included in the institutions that regulated the medical profession .6 The social, political, and institutional transformations initiated by the political a nd armed mobilization of 1910 reframed the problem of regulating medical practice in the 1920s and 30s. This chapter analyzes th ese transformations and their impact on the policies to regulate the medical profession. After armed mobilizations ceased in 191 7, the reconstruction of Mexico began. A new Constitution was issued ; institutions that administered professional training were pushed into profound reorganization, shifting the role of the state in regulating professional medical training; public health r ose as a form of governance and its institutions enforced sanitary regulations that regarded unlicensed physicians as a public health threat. These trends sometimes coincided and sometimes competed to establish both a coherent legislation that ruled the professional life of physicians and a monolithic institutional infrastructure that enforced such legislation. These tensions an d contradictions originated, according to author ities and university physicians , in the lack of a norm that established which profe ssions required a professional medical degree; in other words in the lack of regulation of article 4 of the Constitution . The Mexican state did not achieve the central control of medical training and practice until early in 1855 in AHSS, SP, EM, 2, 36. Sanitary authorities used the medical degree as a credential that helped them prevent unlicensed medical practitioners from participating in official government life in the 1870s, such as the issuing of death certificates. See \"CR\u00d3NICA Porfiriato.\" 6 Ana Mar\u00eda Carrillo points out that these professions, including surgeons and phlebotomists, were assimilated by the medical profession, while others, such as homeopaths, contested the profession's authority. See Carrillo, \"Profesiones el M\u00e9xico del siglo XIX.\" 173 the 1940s, when article 4 was re gulated. Sanitary authorities and the medical profession, including homeopaths, had a deep influence in the outcomes of such regulation, but these discussions took place beyond the DSP and the National University of Mexico [UNM]. In this chapter, I examine the negotiations between DSP, UNM, and SEP author ities who worked to pass regulation s to control medical practice. In particular, I emphasize the central role that sanitary authorities played in this process. The UNM did not want to assume the role of a state institution that pre scribed professional training, particularly at free schools, and in the late 1920s lost its place as a state institution that could potentially regulate professional training, at least locally in Mexico City. Facing a lack of willingness and ultimately authority, the DSP promoted reforms to , and the enforcement of , the Sanitary Code, aiming to cope with practitioners who lacked irregular medical degrees. I argue that the drive to control medical practice came from the DSP's new position in the government structure initiated in 1917, from where it had the authority to rule on health matters all over the nation. I also argue that sanitary authorities aimed to sanitize the profession at the national level assuming that the demography of professional physicians in the countryside reflected that of Mexico City. This led to a wave of complaints from the countryside which is the subject of the next chapter. Throughout this chapter I assume that sanitary authorities are acting a s a consequence of the demands of graduates from free schools, particularly homeopathic, first from Mexico City and later from other states. An analysis of these negotiations and their effect on the sanitary legislation will be provided in the next chapter . 174 \"Legal or legally validated medical degrees\": The Shifting Role of the Revolutionary State to Regulate Medical Degrees The institutional instability that the Maderista revolution caused during the early years of the 1910s had a deep impact on the regula tion of the medical profession, as Ricardo E. Manuell and Eduardo Lavalle y Carbajal attest .7 Manuell's reference to the liberal practice of medicine as \"the fifth plague\" , which needed eradication, and Lavalle y Carbajal's argument in favor of requiring \" legal or legally validated medical degrees\" to anyone who practiced medicine evidenced the uncertainties that members of the Academy of Medicine of Mexico perceived regarding the professional liberty granted in the Constitution . Manuell argued that the last of the biggest great national plagues [...w]as a bad weed called The Free Practice of Medicine, which had as origin the ultra -liberal ideas of the authors of the Constitution [of 1857]; for growing field, the disinterest of the Mexican personality, which commiserates on but do not responds against harms that do not have a personal impact; as food, the generalized presumption that everyone has qualities of a physician; as fertilizers, ignorance, suggestibility, and the need to believe that anyone can formul ate an opinion on matters of a profession that they do not practice; and as victim, the whole Republic.8 He argued that the practice of medicine required specialized knowledge and that no one should be put at risk by being put into the care of someone who, while well versed in other branches of human knowledge, had tangential or no knowledge of medicine. Moreover, he particularly focused his critiques on those who pretended to see something in the secret arcane that constituted medicine [that attracted everyone, and that event the true priests who practiced medicine could 7 See Manuell, \"DISCURSO pronunciado por su autor, en anfiteatro de la Escuela Preparatoria, el marzo de ; y Carbajal, anfiteatro de la Escuela Preparatoria, el 6 de marzo de 1912,\" 121. 175 not penetrate] and believed, and made others believed, that they had grasped one of the secret light beams that escaped the insight of the officiants.9 He provided a description of t hese practices, among which were native people's healing approaches mingled with traditional religious beliefs; \"more civilized\" domestic remedies whose curative powers were testified by large lists of professionals, even physicians; charlatans who spectac ularly advertised their services in the streets, offering secret remedies to heal incurable diseases; new drugs or serums whose therapeutic efficacy was certified by non -medical authorities such as judges, governors, bishops and the like; and medical consu ltation by mail. Homeopaths, as analyzed in chapter 3, had a particular place in his critique. Lavalle y Carbajal 's critique regarded the liberal practice of medicine in the same terms as Manuell's. He believed that Mexico City [was] cruelly suffering under the scourge of that epidemic endemic [\"endemia epidemizada \"] Fortunately, it was easily to indirectly apply the [article] 33 with the regulation of [article] 3 [of the Constitution ] to the free germs of this invadi ng pest. After that, the purification of the means ..., legal, will suffocate the epidemic.\" For him, \"the Mexican medical science was agonizing because of [the growing population of charlatans], and the Congress could apply an effective restorative injectio n, expulsing the merchants from the temple, preventing young galenos from being tempted by the reckless mercantilism of those who do not have a name to defend and a school to honor.10 After analyzing the laws and codes that regulated the medical professio n in Mexico and how the liberal practice of medicine made sanitary preventions and actions ineffective, he believed that the focus of regulation should be that an \"official or officially validated degree must be required to every physician\", as the title o f his critique read. For him, regulation did not end with the granting of a diploma. The government needed to undertake specific steps to warrant proper 9 Manuell, \"DISCURSO pronunciado por su autor, en anfiteatro de la Escuela Preparatoria, el 6 de marzo de 1912,\" 123. 10 Lavalle's paper was a thorough analysis of the current legal situation of the medical practice in Mexico and in France. His analysis resulted in guidelines that indicated ways in which Mexico could adopt such regulatory tende ncies. See Lavalle y Carbajal, oficialmente revalidado,\" 138. 176 medical training. Accordingly, the Ministry of Public Instruction needed to certify private schools' me dical degrees by supervising the annual examinations in those schools, he said. Only in that way, he concluded, the state will warrant that certificates, degrees , or titles, issued by the Free School, proofed an undeniable aptitude, [...] that the curricula is extensive and intensive enough to produce aptitude, and that private degrees corresponded to the same knowledge validated by the degre es issued by the state.11 The regulatory framework he proposed was particularly addressed to private schools which wer e starting to populate Mexico City's landscape in the early 1910s (see chapter 3). However accurate and pertinent Manuell's and Lavalle y Carbajal's descriptions and proposals were, it revealed the anxieties and hopes that the medical profession faced in a new order which at least they perceived as an opportunity for both irregular healers to perpetuate their illegal practice and elite professional physicians to accomplish the regulation of article 3 of the ruling Constitution and monopolize medical practic e. On one hand, t he proliferation of private medical schools such as the Escuela Libre de Homeopat\u00eda de M\u00e9xico (see chapter 3) fed academic physicians' and public health authorities' anxieties about the increased presence of irregular practitioners and sch ools that provided them with illegal medical degrees in Mexico City. On the other, policies such as Madero's support to the National Academy of Medicine in 1912 fed hopes about the regulation of the medical profession.12 The construction of the revolutionar y state worked contradictorily in this process of regulation. On one side, the Constitution of 1917 did not regulate professional practice and left the congress the authority to do so in the future. During the 1920s and 30s, this allowed a margin for polit ical negotiations 11 Lavalle y Carbajal, oficialmente Academy requested such acknowledgment to Presdient Madero. On January 9, 1912, D\u00edaz Lombardo replied that Madero acknowledged it as an \"oficial institituion\". See \"La Academia N. de Medicina de M\u00e9xico, ha recibido la si guiente comunicaci\u00f3n.\" 177 between different factions that did not always result in the fulfillment of what elite professionals such as doctors and lawyers desired . On the other side, sanitary authorities gained unprecedented political power during these years , giving doctors a privileged position in the new structure of the revolutionary state. They used this hegemonic control over federal public health to get rid of the \"fifth plague\" or, in other words, to sanitize the profession. The Constitution of 1917 pr ovided the regulatory framework around which the state structured its institutions. Article 3 of the previous Constitution was almost left untouched in the new one; with the exception of the last paragraph, the one that regulated professional practice. The new Constitution legally separated the connection that existed between free education and free professional practice, turning at least ideologically and legally professions into a social rather than an academic issue .13 Hisotrian Arce Gurza analyzes how co ngressmen who elaborated the new Constitution left behind the mid -19th-century liberal ideology that was the core of the Constitution of 1857 .14 These modifications to article 3 and 4 were conceived to bring professional services, particularly those of lawy ers and physicians, to the population, which frequently did not have the economic resources to pay for these professional services. At the same time, congressmen considered that the Constitution should also protect the population from services provided by unqualified professionals. Hence, such reforms aimed to socialize professions and create laws that regulated them. But article 4 of the Constitution of 1917 fell short from these ideals. Besides separating the right to work from the right to education, art icle 4 only introduced the notion that professions needed to be legal, but each federal state remained responsible of \"establishing the professions that needed a degree to practice, the requirements to 13 Arce Gurza, \"El inicio de Arce Gurza analyses the speech of Deputy Machorro Narv\u00e1ez during the Congress meetings celebrated in 1916 to create the new constitution. Arce Gurza, \"El un a Nueva Era, 1910 -1945,\" 292 -4. 178 obtain such a degree, and the institutions authorized to issue professional degrees.\"15 The idea materialized in 1942 , leaving a three -decade -long space of struggles to control professional training and practice. As in the 19th century, the definition of a legal medical degree during the 1920s and 30s depended on the reconfigurations of state institutions which in turn responded to the political allegiances of the military leader in turn who managed to arrive to the presidency. Consequently, the problem of regulating a medical degree and by extension medical pr actice was a complex one. The degree was the point of confluence of several social, political and economic needs that were highly contested and negotiated during the post revolutionary period in Mexico. Among these were the professionalization of the worki ng class, which implied the need to provide workers and artisans with adequate training; the incorporation of public health policies that improved life expectancy of the working force, which included the provision of adequate medical services by well train ed doctors; the modernization of medical training, which required expensive facilities and surgical instrument s; and the ideological and economical conflict between the Mexican state and the UNM concerning the sociopolitical role of the university and the state's compromise to fund it. Which institution had the legal right to offer a medical degree was a question that raised all sorts of contradictory responses from different actors. Once Venustiano Carranza established a somewhat stable government in 1916 , he used the Porfirian infrastructure to carry out the social reforms embodied in the new Constitution . The UNM became the center that administered some of the professional schools in Mexico City, including the National School of Medicine [ENM]. Initially , it aimed to police professional practice. For instance, in 1916, Felix F. Palavicini, Minister of Instruction and Head of the National University demanded to the Ministry of the Interior that the Police Department of 15 Article 4 of the Constitution of 1917. See Arce Gurza, \"El inicio de una Nueva Era, 1910 -1945,\" 295. 179 Mexico City prosecute those who pract iced without a legal professional degree, and oblige them to validate their studies and take a professional exam .16 But in the early 1920s, the university stopped policing professional practice. The situation of the UNM in the new government structure was c ontradictory. On one side, Porfirian elites had created it in 1910 with the aim to turn it into a federal office that regulated professional training all over the nation. The National School of Homeopathic Medicine and other professional schools in the res t of the republic used the university's medical curriculum and regulations as models to frame their own throughout the 1910s and 20s, turning the university into an academic authority. On the other side, neither the ruling Constitution in 1910 nor the Constitution of 1917 gave the UNM the legal framework that could have turned it into a regulatory institution at the national level. Rather the contrary, professional and educational liberalism altogether with the strong federalism in both Constitution s helped to keep the university an institution that could only legally regulate professional training and the issuing of degrees in Mexico City. In other words, while the university enjoyed academic prestige all over the nation, becoming the actual academic au thority in professional training after 1910, the Constitution of 1917 did not ratify it in legal or bureaucratic terms as a regulatory institution. The authority of the university as a center of professional control was further undermined when Jos\u00e9 Vascon celos became its Dean in the early 1920s. Vasconcelos transformed the UNM from a Porfirian institution that instructed social and economic elites into a popular institution that offer ed professional training and transmitted a new cultural identity to the m asses. His 16 In his demand, Palavicini used the same arguments as Lavalle previously did in 1913. The possession of a degree was for the sake of the public interest and fair competition. Ignorance brought exploitation of the Mexican people by foreign professionals or those who obtained a degree without the proper scientific training. If there were two types of degrees, one which re quired years of study and one which could be easily obtained, the latter, so the argument went on, would be better positioned in the market of professional services. Felix Palavicini's intervention wanted to make the interest of the UNM's graduates prevail over those of charlatans. See AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 1, 29, 8. 180 project did not always fit the demands of professional elites, as in the case of the faculty of the National School of Medicine (see chapter 3 where I analyzed Vasconcelos' support to homeopathy). Moreover, in administrative terms, the UNM lost its privileged position when Vasconcelos created the SEP to undertake the task of sending qualified t eachers throughout the country and educate a largely illiterate population. In this reorganization, the university became an office that only administered professional schools. This impacted its position as a n institution that regulated professional degrees. In its new administrative position, the UNM decided in 1922 not to revalidate professional degrees from neither national nor foreign universities, a pol icy that it pursued throughout 1929 .17 In exchange, it offered to endorse such degrees if it attested that their degrees were somehow legal .18 The difference was subtle but meaningful. Revalidation implied that the university warranted the training the degre e holder had received, while endorsing meant that it warranted that the degree holder had received the degree from the institution the degree actually stated. This important difference translated into criteria that the UNM used to either endorse or provide a professional degree. To pass the test of legality and endorse a degree, the university had to acknowledge that the foreign professional schools that issued the degrees either had an international agreement with the Mexican government to allow the practi ce of their graduates in 17 Just in 1920 President Adolfo de la Huerta had passed legislation that established criteria to revalidate degrees in the UNM. See AHUNM, ENAE, Secretar\u00eda, Programas, planes y reglamentos, 20, 4 36. For the regulation in 1922, see the pamphlet of the National University of Mexico signed by Manuel Puga y Cal, secretary of the university, May 30, 1922. AHUNAM, UN, Rectoria, D. E. U., 14, 236. The session of the University Council that approved this regulation was held on May 21, 1922; see AHSS, SP, EM, 4, 7. On March 26, 1925, Plutarco El\u00edas Calles ratified the criterion of 1922. See summary of the DSP's annual inform, section 28, in \u00c1lvarez Am\u00e9zquita, Bustamante and Fern\u00e1ndez del Castillo, Historia de la salubridad y de la asistencia en Mexico 254. See also section VIII in the report from the office of medical demography in the \"INFOMRE DEL DEPARTAMENTO DE SALUBRIDAD DE 1925\", in AHSS, SP, P, S, 9, 1 5. 18 Besides the test of legality, the person needed to certify his/her identity and that the professional degrees were genuine. 181 Mexico or was considered by the university as worthy. For national schools, the university needed to verify that they were authorized by their respective local government and laws. The UNM issued professional degrees only when its schools and faculty examined students who requested a degree from it. This meant that the university granted professional degrees to students who had undertaken either partially or totally their studies in other universities and later passed a general exam ination in the professional schools of the university. With this regulation university authorities placed not the degree, but knowledge as sanctioned by UNM faculty, as the center of professional regulation. What matter ed was not the document itself, which many faked, according to Ricardo E. Manuell, to enter into the business of medicine, but the training the degree represented. Throughout the 20th century, the UNM's medical curriculum remained the standard of proficient medical training and its regulation s placed the university as the office that controlled the revalidation of professional medical degrees, at least in Mexico City. This centralization of professional education in the university led to contradictory outcomes in the regulation of homeopathic medical degrees. On one side, Vasconcelos ' support of the National School of Homeopathic Medicine [ENMH] did not imply any improvement in the regulation of its professional degrees. D\u00edaz's decree made them legal regardless of the administrative changes ta king place in the transitional years after the issuing of the Constitution of 1917. Yet, while Vasconcelos' administrative reorganization brought economic support to the ENMH as a school within the UNM, it eventually led to the school's closure in 1924. Th is meant that the single homeopathic medical school able to issue legal medical degrees stopped existing in the mid -1920s. The outcome was a regulatory measure from university authorities who were mostly ENM graduates, rather than Vasconcelos, to ban homeo pathic training at the ENM and homeopathic medical degrees (as analyzed in chapter 3). This situation changed again in 1928, 182 when the ENMH was reinstalled as a medical school regulated by the SEP rather than the UNM .19 President El\u00edas Calles' decree was a c opy of the one issued by Porfirio D\u00edaz in 1895, both academically and administratively, placing the homeopathic school in the same situation as it was during the 1910s. Yet being hosted by the SEP rather than the university, the process of autonomy of the national university and the regulations of free schools during 1929 -30 (see below) did not impact the ENMH 's legal status or the legality of its degree. Du ring ENMH's first years (1910 -24) and after 1928, its problems lied in aspiring to become a medical s chool and improving its facilities and medical curricula (as analyzed in chapter 3), rather than enjoying legal status. On the other side, it meant that the Free School of Homeopathy [ELHM], the one that was actually producing the largest amount of homeopa thic physicians in Mexico City in the early 1920s, was not acknowledged as a medical school. Their graduates could not endorse their degrees with the university because it did not acknowledge studies undertaken in free schools .20 They could request to be ex amined in order to obtain a degree from the university, but the process implied that ELHM graduates acknowledged that their alma mater was not actually a legal school \u2014 something they fought for until the school received official recognition (see below) . This created confusion amongst university authorities who needed to accommodate internal regulations according to particular cases and caused students to be concern ed about the irregularities in such processes. Request s to validate homeopathic medical de grees happened very rarely. The case of brothers Aliber and Eliud Garc\u00eda Trevi\u00f1o in 1923 is demonstrative of the 19 Article 2 prevented that the SEP would issue the ENMH degrees. See \"Decreto por el cual se establece la carrera de M\u00e9dico Cirujano Home\u00f3pata.\"7 20 In a conflict between ELHM graduates and the DSP about the registry of the former's degrees in the medical registry in 1922, Antonio Caso, head of the UNM, replied to a request by Gabriel Malda, head of the DSP, about the legality o f degrees issued by free schools that the university did not validate titles issued by free schools. Chapter 5 provides more detail about this conflict. See correspondence of November 14, 1922 in AHSS, SP, EM, 4, 15, p. 28. 183 political tensions that the regulation of medical degrees created between the university, the ENMH, and the ELHM .21 This case evidences both the UNM's authority strength and weakness as an institution that regulated professional degrees; the strength, because both brothers sought to obtain the university's endorsement of their high -school and post -graduate certificates and the revalidation of thei r medical degrees, acknowledging the university as the regulatory institution of professional training in Mexico; the weakness, because the procedures to revalidate their medical degrees implied that the university did not acknowledge training at other ins titutions, particularly free medical schools. Moreover, apparently validating regulations were not applied consistently. For instance, Leopoldo Hern\u00e1ndez Ch\u00e1vez could not take the UNM's validating exam because, so did UNM authorities argued, the ELHM lacke d the regulation, while Apolonio D. Guti\u00e9rrez was able to course the specialties of pediatrics and dermatology at the UNM .22 Both were ELHM graduates. With the conflicts between the UNM and the state at the end of the decade that ended in the detachment of the former as a regulatory institution of the state, the university's privileged political and administrative position came to an end. The rupture was a consequence of the larger struggle for the political control of the country23 which in turn motivated UNM's faculty and 21 I analyze with detail this ca se in chapter 5. Aliber obtained the degree, but after the conflicts motivated by students' complaints, he decided to desist from his request 22 It is unclear in the source which university office denied the exam. It is probable, because it had already happened before with brothers Eliud and Aliber Garc\u00eda Trevi\u00f1o, that while the rector authorized homeopaths to take the exam, internal regulations of the School of Medicine prevented them from doing it. Los m\u00e9dicos de la Escuela Libre 17. 23 \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n, the elected president of Mexico in 1928, was assassinated on July 17 by a citizen that reacted against the repressive political regime -particularly against its anti -Catholic attitude - of the former president, Plutarco El\u00edas Calles. During the following six years, a historical period know as the Maximato , the country was administratively led by three interim presidents, Emilio Portes Gil, Pascual Ortiz Rubio and Manuel L. Rodr\u00edguez, who stayed in office approximately two years. They obeyed El\u00edas Calles as the political leader of the nation, hence his surname, the Jefe M\u00e1ximo . But political leadership did not always mean a unified government, for each new president along with its secretaries of state unde rtook administrative actions that differed the ones implemented by the next one. The form in which Pascual 184 students to push for the university's autonomy and support a particular political faction .24 As a result, the National University of Mexico turned into the Autonomous National University of Mexico [hereon UNAM]. With its autonomy earned, the UNAM became a professional institution similar to the rest of professional schools that existed in Mexico City, at least in administrative terms, for it stopped working as the regulatory center of professional education in Mexico City. The SEP took on the task to regulate free schools. The DSP in particular coordinated with this ministry to agree on the criteria that made private schools' facilities adequate, their medical curricula comprehensive, and consequently their degrees creditable . The involvement of two ministries with contrasting and sometimes opposing criteria to cope with the regulation of such schools, together with the changes that the Organic Law of the UNAM went through in 1929 and 1933 created ideological, legal, and executive inconsistenci es that made the transition far from smooth. While somewhat negotiated between the SEP, the DSP, and graduates from private medical schools, the formulation of the laws that regulated these schools was mandated directly Ortiz Rubio stepped off office -he read about his own resignation to the presidency in a morning newspaper - epitomized the political and administrati ve conflicts during the Maximato . 24 The history of the struggle of faculty and students from the UNM to achieve autonomy from the Mexican state's control dates back to its creation in 1910. This history developed throughout the 1920s and 30s, sometimes through faculty demands, and sometimes through students' congresses or protests. After 1920, with Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos as its Dean, the University became a tool to develop the nationalistic and revolutionary project of providing basic education to the entire nation. This meant the mobilization of a huge amount of material and human resources to the countryside in order to reach the most economically underserved sectors of the population. But professional education remained elitist and liberal; elitist, for only the affluent sectors of the society, many of them living in urban centers, especially in Mexico City, could afford this type of education, and liberal because it believed in its own academic and administrative self -governance. In 1928 new projects to attain the autonomy were proposed, one by a students' association and the other by Dean Alfonso Pruneda, but none of them succeeded. In 1929, once Emilio Porte Gil took office, a minor conflict between university students and authorities escalated to the point where the public force surreptitious ly infiltrated the university campus, confronting a group of students that manifested against them. President Portes Gil's overreaction was caused by the political struggles between the ruling party and the party led by Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos, the one students' leaders supported. The conflict turned into a general strike which Portes Gil solved by giving the National University its autonomy. See Mendoza Rojas, Los conflictos de la UNAM en el siglo XX 49-70. 185 by the President, in response to gr aduates', particularly homeopaths, demands. The Organic Law of 1929 proposed to gradually turn UNAM into a private university without \"any right to impose its criteria in the evaluation of free and private institutions that offered education similar to the one the university provided\" .25 Article 37 explicitly turned the responsibility to regulate free schools, validate their curricula, and legalize their degrees to the President of Mexico and the SEP. Two weeks after this law was issued, Arturo Palmero, Dean of the Free School of Obstetrics and Nursing of Mexico, and a group of \"Free Homeopathic Doctors\" submitted their proposals suggesting how such regulations should be dictated .26 Sanitary authorities received authorization from the President and the SEP's m inister to participate in the discussions that would produce the needed legislation .27 In their view, the DSP was \"deeply interested in the importance that the regulation of such Free Schools had in Public Health, particularly respective to the medical prof ession, and in warrant of the interest of society.\"28 Yet, regardless of such legitimate interest, the SEP authorities never called back DSP representatives, and President Portes Gil issued the decree that regulated free schools on October 22, 1929. The de cree contained in essence what free schools originally proposed, though accommodated to fit the legal requirements that a decree of this scope demanded. It defined free schools as private enterprises at all levels of education with no limitations regarding their 25 \"Ley org\u00e1nica de la Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma\", c onsiderando 12. http://abogadogeneral.unam.mx/PDFS/COMPENDIO/34.pdf Consulted on January 30, 2014. 26 Arturo Palmero submitted his \"Proyecto de reglamento de las escuelas libres\" on August 9, 1929. It is unclear who the addressee was. The \"Proyecto presentado por los doctores home\u00f3patas libres\" is not dated but next to the previous document in AHSS, SP, S J, 7, 2 27 The head of the DSP, Aquilino Villanueva, requested Lic. Enrique Monterrubio, head of the DSP Office of Legal Affairs, and Dr. Francisco del P. Miranda, head of the Office of Exchange to represent the DSP. Lic Beteta was the SEP's representative.

To be considered authorized or legal, these schools needed to give the SEP information about their curricula and admission requirem ents. In turn the SEP verified the school's capability to sustain the training it aimed to provide and determined the minimum requirements to grant degrees. SEP, thence, turned into the office responsible to revalidate, and make legal, the degrees issued b y authorized free professional schools. The decree, in other words, provided venues through which free schools turned into legal institutions. Supported by the Federation of Worker Unions of the Federal District, ELHM graduates met with President Portes G il to discuss the authorization of their school. Following the decree's guidelines, the Ministry of Public Education carried out a thorough investigation of the school. The report stated that the ELHM academic curriculum was satisfactory, though authoritie s were not able to verify if the school actually carried it out as documents stated \u2014 the inspection took place during a holiday break . The school 's facilities suffered deficiencies and needed to meet specific hygienic requirements, particularly the rooms of surgery and obstetrics, but the school's authorities followed the Ministry's recommendations. The SEP concluded that if the school required that new students previously studied three years of high school before they were enrolled and if the school actua lly covered the academic curriculum, then the ministry \"warranted the rights of the society in terms of the training offered in that institution since that date [when the report was issued] and authorized the revalidation of titles granted as a consequence of such training.\"30 On January 28, 1930, the President issued a decree that made 29 The decree is in \"Documento N\u00fam. Tres. DECRETO DE 22 DE la de The SEP's office of Pycho -pedagogy and Hygiene carried out the ins pection and submitted its report on December 31, 1929. I did not have access to the specific report, but the Ministry of Public Education commented about it to President Pascual Ortiz Rubio on the correspondence of March 3, 1930, in AHSS, 187 the ELHM legal .31 The new law just made clear the content of high school studies required for enrollment as well as the time and content of medical training required for gradu ation. The ELHM from now on offered the degree of M\u00e9dico home\u00f3pata cirujano y partero [Homeopathic Physicians, Surgeon and Obstetrician] with the same legal status as those of any other government -authorized medical school. Inconsistent policies that resul ted from short -term presidential periods altogether with the larger medical profession's willingness to rule out free schools led the DSP to promote the rectification of the Presidential decrees that legalized free schools. Taking advantage that Pascual Ortiz Rubio had stepped in early in February 1930, the National Academy of Medicine, the Mexican Medical Association, the Federation of Medical Unions of the Federal District and the Medical Union of the Federal District addressed the President with their co ncern about the regulation of free schools and they requested the DSP to stop revalidating these schools' medical degrees until the President responded to these unions and professional societies' petitions .32 The SEP addressed the President with similar demands .33 The SEP's minister argued two things; first, that in the decree of January 28, there was no time requirement for the duration of high school studies and that the ELHM was the ultimate authority to decide if these where carried out properly; secon d, that the decree validated all degrees issued by the school since its creation, while the decree warranted the adequate medical training of students who had just started their SP, SJ, 7, 2.

Consequently, he requested a reform to the new decree that acknowledged their demands. The President decided to stop validating ELHM degrees until the DSP and the SEP agreed on what course to follow .34 During the exchanges between the SEP and the DSP, the SEP's legal counselor suggested they stop revalidatin g ELHM's decrees, but the DSP's legal counselor, drawing on previous experience dealing with registering ELHM degrees (see chapter 5), warned that this course would only lead to lawsuits that homeopaths would win, constituting a precedent that would impose limits on a later modification of the original decree .35 Regardless of both government offices' agreement on the lack of warrant to the society that the decree of January 28 implied ,36 sanitary authorities could prevent the legalization of the free school o f homeopathy. The SEP undertook responsibility to regulate degrees issued by professional schools. On March 17, 1932, Pascual Ortiz Rubio reformed the decree of October 22, 1929, giving the UNAM back the academic authority over high school and professional education .37 This meant that if new private institutions wanted to be authorized by the federal government their high school and professional academic curricula needed to resemble those of UNAM. Free schools previously authorized by the decree of October 2 2, 1929, including the ELHM, had a period of six months to fulfill the requirements of the new decree and continue as legal 34 The note \"Asuntos que se llevan al acuerdo del C. Presidente de la Rep\u00fablica el d\u00eda de febrero de 1930\" includes a handwritten note, arguably from the President, that reads \"Say to education [SEP] to stop rectifying [sic, revalidating] titles until the De partment [of Public Health, I assume] gives its opinion\". AHSS, SP, SJ, 7, 2. On March 14, 1930, President Ortiz Rubio addressed Rafael Silva, head of the DSP, authorizing that the DSP gathered with SEP authorities to discuss improvements to the decrees th at authorized the ELHM. See \"ACUERDO del Presidente\" in AHSS, SP, SJ, 28, 3. 35 \"MEMORANDUM relativo a la reglamentaci\u00f3n de las escuelas libres\", where the head of the DSP Office of Legal Affairs explains the situation to the head of the DSP on May 2, 1930; AHSS, SP, SJ, 7, 2. 36 Report on the reunions that representatives from the DSP and the SEP had on June 23, 1930.

Apparently, Dr. V\u00edctor Fern\u00e1ndez Manero, from the DSP, joined a few days later (June 26, 1930). See AHSS, SP, SJ, 7, 2. 37 See Diario Oficial de la Federaci\u00f3n , March 17, 1932, p. 6 -7. 189 institutions. With the decree of January 28 giving legal status to the ELHM, this new reform introduced legal inconsistencies that r esulted in lawsuits that the DSP wanted to prevent in the first place. Reforms carried out at the end of the Maximato (1928 -34) wanted to give back the UNM the political and administrative position it enjoyed before 1929, yet in terms of the regulation of free professional schools this resulted in contradictory outcomes. In 1933, the President issued a new Organic Law f or UNAM . This new law had no regulations that specifi ed the relationship between the university and free professional school s. The former l aw of 1929 made clear that the President would be responsible through the SEP to regulate free professional schools. But since the law of 1933 substituted the one of 1929 and since the decree of March 1932 gave academic authority over free professional sch ools, these regulations actually gave back UNAM the authority over all professional education in Mexico City. As I will analyze in chapter 6, these waves of regulations produced a tide of lawsuits from graduates of free professional schools who at one time had made their degrees legal and at another the DSP rejected them as illegal. \"Sanitizing the Medical Profession\": The Sanitary Code and the Enforcement of the \"Sanitary Dictatorship\" The central role of sanitary authorities after the 1920s was a consequ ence of the push of doctors during the meetings that created the Constitution of 1917 to turn health into a national and constitutional concern. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez argued in the Constitutional Congress of 1917 that \"to live well the longest possible time \" was an economic and social value beyond the individual and he believed that it was so important that the state had the right to even 190 \"despotically intervene on the social and individual hygiene\".38 For him, the \"sanitary dictatorship\", as he called this f orm of intervention, was the only type of dictatorship that civilized countries should tolerate . This view materialized in the Constitution and in government structures. Article 73 turned the local Superior Council of Health into a consulting group that responded directly to the President, and its executive office, the local Superior Board of Health, into the Department of Public Health [ Departamento de Salubridad P\u00fablica , here on DSP], an institution with the attributes of a Ministry .39 It did not need to r eport to any other Ministry and its dispositions were applicable throughout the country. Moreover, in case of epidemic disease, it could implement preventative measures without notifying the President. In contrast to the geographically limited legal authority of the UNM, the DSP used its privileged institutional and legal position to carry out regulations intended to control medical practice. While the faculty of the National School of Medicine pushed fo r curricular reforms that incorporated the most recent medical advances into the training of future generations of medical doctors at the UNM throughout the 1920s, sanitary authorities, which had been trained at the university's medical school, pushed for reforms aimed to control the \"fifth plague\" or the liberal practice of medicine. As graduates from the most prominent medical school of the country at the time, they used ENM's training as the model to which they referred when assessing what was adequate m edical training. They also used the UNM's degrees as legal documents that legitimized the practice of their holders. This effort was not new. Sanitary authorities had used this criterion since they started implementing sanitary regulations after the Wars o f Reform in 1871. But their new position allowed them to enforce measures in the 1920s and 30s, whereas 38 Ernesto Arechiga C\u00f3rdoba, \"\"Dictadura 121. 39 See Article 73 of the Constitution of 1917, in \u00c1lvarez Am\u00e9zquita, Bustamante and Fern\u00e1ndez del Castill o, Historia salubridad y de la asistencia en Mexico 69-70. 191 they could not during the Porfiriato . This section analyzes the regulations pushed by the DSP during this time frame. Whether practitioners complied wit h them will be discussed in the following chapter. Under the guidance of Rodr\u00edguez, the DSP resumed the former task of regulating the medical profession that sanitary authorities had stopped during the 1910s. First sanitary authorities attempted to enforce the ruling Sanitary Code in 1920. Alfonso Pruneda, the general secretary of the department, reminded all physicians of their obligations to register their degrees with the department and inform the address of their consulting offices .40 But sanitary author ities might have perceived that the ongoing regulations were not enough to prevent the proliferation of irregular practitioners because three months later the department published a new regulation that went beyond creating a national medical registry. Sani tary authorities now aimed to more actively control the medical marketplace by regulating how practitioners advertised their medical services, using the medical degree as the element to distinguish between medical practitioners .41 The new regulation allowed registered physicians, surgeons, obstetricians, pharmacists, odontologists, veterinarians, and homeopaths, to advertise only the services they were entitled to, according to the title they possessed. It was open and clear about what the DSP considered leg al degrees, \"those accepted by the National University and those issued by the School of Medicine 40 Announcement published in the bulletin of the Department of Public Health on May 28, 1920. See \"Ejercicio Historia de la salubridad y de la asistencia en Mexico 145. 41 The legislation appeared in the Diario Oficial of August 2nd, 1920, and just as the previous legislation, it was signed by the secretary of the Department of Public Health, Alfonso Pruneda, on July 20th of the same year. Alfonso Pruneda, \"Por el Departamento veterinaria l Asociaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica Mexicana. Bolet\u00edn de Propaganda I.2 (1920). 192 of the Army and th e School of Veterinary Medicine\",42 in other words schools regulated by the local government of Mexico City , thus enacting the policy carried out during the Porfiriato . Practitioners who did not have a degree were required to take an examination to test their knowledge. Those who did not want to be subjected to the scrutiny of sanitary authorities or who did not satisfy the latter's criteria co uld not advertise their services. And those who did fulfill the requirements or criteria of the sanitary authorities had still to clearly state in their advertisements that they practiced without a degree. The legislation gave only thirty days to comply wi th both the registry and the corresponding modification in the advertisements, after which the sanitary authority would charge fines between 5 and 500 Mexican pesos, and remove medical publicity. The intervention of the DSP in the control of the medical pr ofession clashed with the liberal practice of professions granted in article 4 of the Constitution of 1917. But with the sanitary dictatorship as the dominant discourse to implement sanitary measures at the national level after 1917, the department used th e idea of health as a social good to argue that those who practiced medicine without the proper knowledge violated the rights of society. For the sanitary authorities, article 4 was not an obstacle to carry out their measures since they believed that this article provided the public administration with the authority to regulate professions when the rights of the society were threatened. Moreover, for them the requirement of a proper medical training and the provision of specific medical services for w hich a practitioner was trained , according to his/her degree, did not represent in any way an intr usion to the liberal practice of y la homeopat\u00eda, en el Distrito Federal \": 58. 193 medicine .43 In the absence of specific regulations for article 4, the DSP established and imposed its own criteria to regulate medic al practice. The DSP followed this line of reasoning and continued delineating criteria to establish which degrees to register and issuing administrative guidelines that were later turned into official decrees during the first half of the 1920s. While in 1920, the sanitary department only registered degrees from the UNM, the Medical School of the Army, and the National Veterinary School, in 1923, the DSP only registered degrees from the National University, foreign schools of countries which had reciprocit y with Mexico, and those issued by state governments, if they complied with local regulations .44 On March 26, 1925, President Plutarco El\u00edas Calles ratified these guidelines, and provided additional ones to cope with free schools. If graduates from free sch ools wanted to register their degrees with the DSP, their schools' curricula needed to be evaluated and validated by the UNM. Otherwise graduates from free schools needed to pass an examination in order to receive degrees from the university .45 In 1924, a n ew political administration brought Doctor Bernardo J. Gastelum as head of the DSP. He initiated a series of reforms that aimed both to increase the central control of the department and increase its presence beyond Mexico City. Regardless of DSP's privile ged position, incongruities between federal and state laws hampered its intervention beyond Mexico 43 These views of the Department of Public Health are reasons given to the measures taken to control the registry and publicity of medical practitioners in the legislation that appeared in the Diario Oficial, Augu st 2nd, 1920, veterinaria y la homeopat\u00eda, en el Distrito Federal \". 44 Apparently the DSP issued new criteria to register degrees o n June 12, 1923. See the letter that the head of the office of medical demography sent providing data for the annual presidential report of 1923, dated on July 12, 1923, in the AHSS SP, S, 8, 11. 45 Inform of the DSP, comment 28; see \u00c1lvarez Am\u00e9zquita, Bust amante and Fern\u00e1ndez del Castillo, Historia de la salubridad y de la asistencia en Mexico 254. See also section VIII in the report from the office of medical demography in the \"INFOMRE DEL DEPARTAMENTO DE SALUBRIDAD DE 1925\"; in the AHSS, SP, S, 9, 15. 194 City, and a reduced budget limited material and human resources for its campaigns. Hence the department's efforts were insufficient and remained geographical ly restricted in the mid -1920s. Gastelum internally reorganized the sanitary department to increase the provision of services at the federal level .46 The new internal regulation of the department clearly specified the institutions that integrated the sanita ry administration, the hierarchy between them, and each one's responsibilities. These regulations did not literally state the place of the campaign to control medical practice, but the department's new administrative organization clearly reflected this interest. For this purpose Bernardo Gastelum created a new Office of Medical Practice, Propaganda, Hygienic Education, and General Archives, headed by Doctor Conrado Iz\u00e1bal Iriarte .47 As its name implies, this new office was originally created to study the pop ulation of medical practitioners in the entire country. Its duties included publicizing the DSP's criteria to register medical degrees with state governments and foreign embassies, registering degrees submitted to the DSP, and gathering information and mak ing it public about towns that lacked medical doctors and the provisions given the latter who wanted to relocate and provide their services in such towns .48 46 For instance, he created thirty two sanitary delegations to carry out the federal government's new functions in state capitals and other important cities. Integrated by three doctors (including a bacteriolo gist), one pharmaceutical inspector, five sanitary agents, one nurse, and support staff, these delegations added to already established federal health offices in ports and border cities. See See Birn, Marriage of Convenience: Rockefeller International Health and Revolutionary Mexico 119. 47 For the new organization and responsibilities of the Department of Public Health see \"Nuevo reglamento general del Departamento de Fern\u00e1ndez del Castillo, Historia de la salubridad y de la asistencia en Mexico 209-16, and 18, respectively. 48 The office was particularly concerned with getting the new criteria to accept medical degrees spread out. See \"Informe sint\u00e9tico de las labores efectuadas de 1925 en curso\" in AHSS, SP, P, S, 9, 15. 195 Gast\u00e9lum's most important achievement during his administration was the formulation of a new Sanit ary Code, in 1926 (Appendix 2). With this new code, he updated the sanitary administration to cope with the contemporary problems that the nation faced, for how would it be possible to fit the solutions of today's problems in the old - fashioned model of th e Sanitary Code of 1902, product of the ossified administration, alien to the contemporary social needs and the systematization that modern life imposes, conceived amongst the world of individualistic doctrines of classical liberalism.49 The code clarified the responsibilities that each level of governance had in the sanitary administration .50 Particularly, it left the control of the medical profession in the hands of both federal and state efforts. The new Sanitary Code incorporated regulations issued duri ng the first half of the 1920s, though if contrasted to the code of 1891 (See Appendixes 1), there were relatively few innovations .51 The most important of these was that the code of 1926 accommodated changes in the administration of professional schools to prevent the registry of any professional degree from free schools .52 Perhaps paying attention to the conflicts that the DSP faced after 1920 regarding the registration of degrees from free schools (see chapter 5), the new sanitary code was more specific th an previous ones about the types of degrees the department could register. All graduates from the UNM, as well as other official universities sponsored by federal or states' 49 \"Nuevo C\u00f3digo de de la salubridad y de la asistencia en Mexico 234. 50 The federal government controlled sanitation in ports, migration, medications and narcotics, alcoholism, and children's hygiene. Federal and state governments in joint authority were resp onsible for the prevention of epidemic diseases, industrial hygiene, and the control of prostitution, and the medical profession. State and local governments were given authority over sanitary engineering, food and beverage hygiene, and transportation heal th. See Birn, Marriage of Convenience: Rockefeller International Health and Revolutionary Mexico 119. 51 Both doctors and practitioners without a degree needed to notify their status to the DSP. Both have to advertise their services according to the degree they had, or the lack of it, and only physicians with a degree could issue death certificates and provide other expert services that demanded a qualified technical proficiency. 52 See \u00c1lvarez Am\u00e9zquita, Bustamante and Fern\u00e1ndez del Castillo, Historia de la salubridad y de la asistencia en Mexico ., p. 249 -50. 196 governments, had open access to the department's registry. Moreover, the National University became the standard to evaluate adequate medical training. The department allowed the registration of degrees issued by foreign universities or free schools only if the university acknowledged the equivalence between their respective curricula. Free schools were a special case. The DSP would only register these schools' degrees if the National University previously acknowledged their existence, approved their curricula, and considered that they had fulfilled any other requirement established by t he university. The new code was more restrictive about the practices that only physicians with a regular degree could perform. While previous codes had only regulated the issuing of death certificates, the new extended regulation over other forms of pract ice where expert knowledge was needed. The issuing of death certificates continued to be a responsibility of physicians with title, unless they found evidence of crime. According to the new code, only registered physicians could be called as experts, and p erform autopsies in legal cases, prepare bodies for burial, prescribe narcotics, and provide medical certificates. Only they were allowed to be hired in administrative offices of scholar hygiene, or legal medicine; or serve as heads of public or private ho spitals, clinics, and welfare institutions. The lack of a general legal framework that regulated professional degrees at the national level, nevertheless, prevented the coordination between federal and state authorities that would enable them to act consistently to control medical practice. The sanitary code acknowledged the incongruities between federal and state law, for in every refor m or new regulation, it also proposed that there were special conditions in the states. In the case of the control o f medical practice, the DSP would accept degrees from official institutions in the states, but these institutions obeyed state laws regarding professional training and the issuing of degrees that were 197 not always followed \u2014 and sometimes even contradicted \u2014 UNM's criteria. Since the legal or otherwise status of a medical degree supported measures with which sanitary authorities aimed to deal with medical advertising and the issuing of death certificates, the differences between how Mexico City and other stat es regulated the granting of medical degrees imposed serious problems to the sanitation of medical practice (See chapter 5). Bernardo Gastelum acknowledged the limitations of the sanitary code in the control of medical practice, blaming the lack of a reg ulation of article 4 of the Constitution for such an outcome .53 What his denunciation implied was that, to the eyes of sanitary authorities, total central control of medical practice would n ot be achieved until the state \u2014 with graduates from the National S chool of medicine at the head \u2014 assumed total control of medical training, pretty much as it had done it with public health in 1917. Facing difficulties with legally establishing the National University as an institution that centrally controlled medical t raining all over the nation, ENM graduates used the DSP status to introduce laws that actually acknowledged the university as such central institution. By placing the UNM as the cornerstone for adequate professional medical training in the sanitary code, t he DSP attempted to solve the gap created by the lack of regulation of article 4, and achieve a certain degree of central regulation and control of medical practice. The DSP used the Office of Demography and Medical Practice, as well as the newly created s anitary delegations to achieve this central control. After the Sanitary Code was reformed in 1926, rather than passively waiting for degrees to arrive to the central office in Mexico City, the office used the newly created sanitary delegations to police pr ofessional practice. It now had \"Agents of the Sanitary Police\" and \"Delegates of the Department\" Historia la salubridad y de la asistencia en Mexico 249-50. 198 advertisements in Mexico City, or gathered information about those who practiced medicine in the countryside .54 In the Federal Distr ict, the \"Agents of the Sanitary Police\" monitored public advertisements in Mexico City, Tacuba, Tacubaya and Mixcoac, contrasted them with the medical registry, and informed the DSP's Office of Legal Affairs of those medical practitioners who broke the la w.55 The DSP's subhead, Roberto Medell\u00edn, addressed state governors to gather information about medical practitioners' addresses, type of healing services provided (literally \"allopathic or homeopathic\"), graduating institutions, and registration status (wh ether in the DSP or with the state government). Throughout the second half of the 1920s, he constantly corresponded with sanitary delegations and state and local governments requesting this information .56 Once the new Sanitary Code was issued, he requested to sanitary delegates that a copy of Chapter 4 \u2014 the one about medical practice \u2014 was \"posted in a visible place in [every sanitary] delegation\", and to governors that the new regulations on the registry of titles were communicated to municipal governments and medical practitioners .57 The office also used national newspapers to inform doctors about their need to register or provide the DSP with their addresses .58 Apparently, the enforcement of the Sanitary Code was gradual and not coercive. The reports of the office in the year that followed the issuing of the new code said that \"Delegates\" 54 See \"Informe de las labores ejecutadas en la de ejercicio de la medicina del 1\u00ba.

Those interested in registering their titles needed to send the original or a certified co py, an official request form, a transcription of the title, and a small photograph of the practitioner .59 The DSP's central office consulted with state governments and universities as well as with the National University the legal status of the degrees it r eceived .60 In 1927, President Calles imposed a tax on the registry of professional titles .61 From this year until the late 1920s, the office reported incomes earned through this tax and fines to those who infringed the sanitary code .62 The report of 1929 said that those persons who had not registered their professional degree or who lacked a legally recognized degree received an appointment from the Office to meet with the DSP lawyer and try to oblige them, by compliance, to fulfill legal dispositions. In tho se cases where it was applicable, they were sanctioned according to the law.63 The DSP's propaganda to inform doctors about the need to register and provide the department with their addresses seemed to work, for the census of medical doctors at the natio nal level increased dramatically in only half a decade. While the Superior Sanitary Board had a somewhat accurate record of the medical profession's demographics in Mexico City, it did not 59 Correspondence between Roberto Medell\u00edn, sub -head of the DSP, and the sanitary delegates, municipal presidents, and state governors.

In 1926, the Office of Demography and Medical P ractice only received 400 pesos in fines. Considering that a practitioner who advertised a \"doctor\" without having a title registered with the DSP was fined with 50 pesos, the amount of 400 pesos would imply only 6 cases of infringement of the code in matt ers of professional practice. From 1926 to 1927, it only received 100 pesos on fines. See \"Informe de las labores ejecutadas en la secci\u00f3n de ejercicio de la medicina del 1\u00ba de julio de 1926 al 30 -1927\"; in AHSS, SP, P, S, 10, 22; 11, 9. 63 See \"Resumen de labores ejecutadas por Secci\u00f3n comprendido 1\u00ba. julio de 1928 al 30 de 1929\", in AHSS, SP, P, S, 11, 27. 200 have the slightest idea of the distribution of medical doctors all over the nation. For instance, the census of 1910 listed 714 doctors in Mexico City, while the medical registry of 1907 counted 554 (See Table 2).64 While it is still difficult to account for an increase of 160 doctors in just three years, this difference w as minimal contrasted to figures for the entire nation. The national census of 1910 listed 3021 doctors, while the medical registry of 1925 had only 1220. Yet the DSP's efforts to break the breach paid off. In 1923, 1924, and 1926, the DSP registered 146, 142 and 257 medical doctors. Just in July 1929, it registered 420 .65 Overall, the DSP general medical directory, which was put together with the information of the medical registry, tripled the number of medical doctors from 1925 to 1929 (See Table 2). The number of doctors who failed to register and medical practitioners who lacked a titled started to appear in DSP's records. In 1926, there were twelve petitions to register titles that were rejected by the DSP and nine registered practitioners without a title ;66 in 1929, these numbers increased to 140 and 84, respectively .67 These statistics evidence the increasing effort of the central sanitary department and satellite sanitary delegations to have a better representation of the medical services provided in the entire nation. Whether this representation was accurate is hard t o assess, but the fact that the medical directory had in 1929 the number of doctors counted by the national census in 1910 64 For the statistics of 1910 see y Ejercicio de la Medicina del 1\u00ba.

Section Ejercicio de la medicina. Box 10. File 20. 202 Furthermore, what sanitary authorities found in their effort to impose their criteria to sanitize the profession was how far they were from professionalizing medical practice at the natio nal level. For instance, Enrique Garc\u00eda Moreno, the sanitary inspector of \"La Magdalena Contreras\", a municipality located 10 miles south from Mexico City, reported that there were only seven medical practitioners, no hospitals, and only a very basic clini c that took care of the injured workers of \"La Magdalena\" and \"Santa Teresa\" factories in the region in the early 1930s .68 The medical services provided in a geographical region so close to Mexico City, the economic, political, and cultural center of the co untry, provides a scenario which allows us to imagine the situation of other towns or villages located in the hinterland, far away from any major city. While DSP's records reflected an overwhelming majority of registered physician - surgeons over homeopaths, practitioners without title, and doctors with title that the DSP did not register (a figure of 3067 vs. 94 vs. 152 vs. 93, in 1929), the structure of the community of medical practitioners in La Magdalena Contreras might have better resembled the structur e of other town and villages' medical communities in the country side. In La Magdalena Contreras, there were only three doctors who possessed a title and four who practiced without it. Dr. Pedro Garc\u00eda Mosqueda was a graduate from the National University, but he was not registered; Dr. Ismael Ramos Alarc\u00f3n, a graduate from the ENMH was the only registered physician in town; and Eduardo Spude had an authorization by the government of the state of Morelos, and though he argued that he had a title from a Germa n medical school, he was not able to show evidence of it. Half of the practitioners without a title were homeopaths. San \u00c1ngel, a neighboring municipality just a couple of miles closer to Mexico City, had two homeopaths registered in the DSP, out of a tota l of nine physicians who practiced in the region, discounting Eduardo Spude 68 Correspondence to the head of the DSP. AHSS, SP, EM, 11, 10, pp. 172. 203 who was already listed in La Magdalena Contreras' list and appeared also in the list of San \u00c1ngel .69 The important presence of homeopaths in Mexico was underrepresented in the medical registry and directories; for the latter was less a representation of homeopaths' demography in Mexico in the 1920s, than an indicator of the marginalizing politics of sanitary authorities regarding medical practice. This comes up particularly if t he registry is analyzed in detail and contrasted to other sources of information for doctors who graduated in free medical schools. Graduates from the ENMH, who possessed a legal medical degree, were heavily underrepresented in the medical registry in the early 1920s (See Graph 2). Only approximately 12.5% of them were registered. Yet apparently, the DSP enforcement of the Sanitary Code and the regulations in the early 1920s that aimed to promote physicians' compliance with the registration worked for ENMH graduates. By the mid 1920s, one third of them were registered .70 It is worth noting that most of the new entries in the medical registry were graduates from the school when this was incorporated to the UNM. This suggests that, in statistical terms, the centralization of medical schools within the university was useful for recent homeopathic graduates. They were willing to comply with the UNM's and the DSP's regulations and be incorporated into the profession's institutional life. However, this also suggests that the DSP's strategy did not work for former ENMH graduates, who did not comply with the registry .71 69 Sanitary inspection's list of medical practitioners of the muni cipality of San \u00c1ngel, no date. AHSS, SP, EM, 11, 10, pp. 173. 70 The medical directory of 1925 listed 77 homeopaths, all ENMH graduates. The school's records show that by 1925 there were 102 graduates. The medical registry listed for this year 37 register ed homeopaths. 71 Or complied really later; for instance, Celiano P\u00e9rez Vargas graduated from the ENMH in 1908 and registered his degree until 1938. There were others, though, that complied almost immediately after the ENMH became a school of the universi ty.

As their doctrinarian peers, ELHM graduates sought to comply with the registry in their own terms (see chapter 5). This meant that they wanted th e DSP to recognize their school as a regular training institution with the authority to grant medical degrees. The regulation did not allow this. Consequently, if they wanted to be part of the DSP's medical registry, they would have to undertake a long process of examinations at the UNM .72 If they wanted to notify the DSP about their practice but not go through the examining process, they had to advertise their services as practitioners with no medical degree. The DSP's exclusionary policies left ELHM gradua tes out of the registry during the 1920s (See Graph 2) .73 Only seldom, homeopaths with foreign degrees were registered .74 Homeopaths from other free schools or homeopathic schools located in the countryside were never registered in the first half of the 1920 s.75 In other words, the medical 72 That this represented a complicated process for them is exemplified by brothers Garc\u00eda Trevino's case and by the relative high rate of ENMH graduates that revalidated their degree after the ENMH became part of the university. 73 No ELHM graduate went into the DSP medical registry before 1929. See \"Registro general de m\u00e9dicos recibidos\" in the Archive of the Free School of Homeopathy. 74 Vicente Sant\u00edn and Te\u00f3filo Olliver y Ortiz had a degr ee issued by the Homeopathic Institute of the Republic of Colombia. They registered their degree early in 1920. Lawrence Mathews Taylor had a degree from Collegii Homeopathici Medici Clevelandensis from Cleveland, Ohio, USA and got registered n 1924. Willi am A. Jemmall's degree from the New York Homeopathic Medical College was revalidated by the State of Yucat\u00e1n and registered in 1925. See AHSS, SSA. DGAJ. Registro de T\u00edtulos de M\u00e9dicos Home\u00f3patas. 75 The School of Electro -Homeopathic Medicine of Mexico, the Homeopathic School of Jalisco, the Free School of Medicine of Puebla, and the Free Homeopathic Institute of Mexico had graduated 30 homeopaths by 1925. Only the Free Homeopathic Institute of Mexico accounted for 26. None of them got into the DSP medical r egistry during the 1920s. Only one homeopath graduated from the National University of the Southwest [ Universidad Nacional del Sureste ] was registered in 1927. See AHSS. Secretar\u00eda y T\u00edtulos de M\u00e9dicos Home\u00f3patas. The Dean of the National University of the Southwest in Merida, Yucat\u00e1n, Eduardo Urz\u00e1is, created a Faculty of Homeopathy on March 17, 1922. The registry recorded only the first two graduates from this school in 1929. See \"Se crea la escuela especial de medicina homeop\u00e1tica en el 206 registry is a reflection of how sanitary authorities wanted the medical profession' demographics to be rather than an accurate picture of it. In this sense, it was a reflection of the DSP's policies to sanitize the professio n. While criteria there were criteria to incorporate irregular practitioners into the medical registry in the sanitary code, practitioners were not willing to comply with them, making the Sanitary Code a tool of exclusion in the 1920s. As I analyzed above , the transition to the 1930s hindered sanitary authorities' hope for a coherent regulatory framework that allowed them to homogenize criteria for the medical registry at the national level. In 1926, the national press considered that \"there were complaint s everywhere against the Department of Public Health\", but no public conference, newspaper propaganda or lawsuit produced a slight change in sanitary authorities' attitude.76 Even courts sided on the DSP's criteria, for no legal demand passed over the new code, according to some newspapers . But, while this was true in some cases, particularly with the one of the ELHM in the mid-1920s, later in the 1920s and during the 1930s th is was no t always the case (see chapter 6 ). The state intervention in the regulation of professional free schools, particularly the ELHM, was a direct blow against DSP's purposes, for instance. Without the UNM as a regulatory institution since 1929 and the SEP's need to comply with the decree that made free professional schools legal from 1929 to 1932, the DSP turned into an institution that policed professional medical training during the first y ears of the 1930s (see chapter 6 ). Yet the window of opportun ity at the turn of the 1930s allowed that medical doctors graduated from free professional schools found their way into the medical registry.

The medical registry during the 1930s is a reflection of the inconsistencies in the regulation of the professional education in Mexico and the l awsuits that graduates from free professional schools won. The law that authorized the ELHM brought waves of graduates to validate their degrees with the SEP and request their registration to the DSP (See Graph 3). By January 30, 1930, only two weeks after President Portes Gil authorized the legality of the ELHM, the SEP had validated 95 doctors of homeopathy; 36 more the following week; and 25 more on August 20 .77 The DSP registered 155 titles in 1930, 80% of which were registered in the first two months af ter the decree was issued. Moreover, the ELHM had graduated 200 students by 1930, and 75% of them were registered by the end of that year, transforming the structure of the population of homeopathic physicians acknowledged by the DSP. While in 1929, the me dical registry included only 36 homeopathic physicians graduated from the ENMH, 2 from other national schools, and 3 from international schools, in 1930, the ELHM was the single homeopathic school that added 155 to the number of registered homeopaths. In s ubsequent years the rate of registration decreased to 15 graduates per year, and in 1933, sanitary authorities stop registering ELHM's titles. From 1934 to 1937 only 3 homeopaths from this school were registered .78 Backed up by UNAM's Organic Law of 1933, t he DSP denied the registry to titles issued by private medical schools. A small number of graduates from other schools were registered through d ifferent means from 1930 to 1942 .79 The registry shows an important 77 Correspondence from authorities from the SEP to the head of the DSP, Januar y 30, February 3, and August 21, 1930, in AHSS, SP, EM, 10, 26, pp. 3, 4, 6. 78 All of them obtained as a consequence of a Supreme Court verdict. 79 2 from the Free School of Homeopathy of Puebla, 10 from other homeopathic medical schools beyond Mexico City (the government of Yucat\u00e1n, the School of Homeopathic Medicine of Yucat\u00e1n, and the School of Homeopathic Medicine of Jalisco), and 2 from foreign schools (the Hahnemann Homeopathic 208 increment of homeopathic medical doctors in 1 938 and the following years (See Graph 3). From 1933 to 1937, the increase in homeopathic medical doctors is accounted by ENMH graduates. During these years, the DSP did not accept ELHM's \u2014 or any other free schools' \u2014 degrees as a consequence of UNAM's Or ganic Law of 1933, leaving the ENMH as the single homeopathic school in a legal status. The sharp increase in 1938 is accounted by 53 ELHM degrees either revalidated by the SEP or registered by an order of the Supreme Court. From 1939 to 1941, 37 graduates from the Free Homeopathic Institute of Mexico registered their degree, once again as a result of a verdict from the Supreme Court .80 College of Philadelphia and the Collegium Medicinae Thompsonianae from All enton). In the case of the Free School of Homeopathy of Puebla, their graduates got to the registry as a consequence of a verdict from the Supreme Court. This wasn't an exception. During these years, other free medical schools, such as the Free School of M edicine of Puebla, were able to win lawsuits against the DSP and get into the registry.

See chapter 6 for furth er details. 80 This institution had been issuing medical titles at least since 1920, and their graduates had been facing the opposition of sanitary authorities at least since 1933, when the President of the Sanitary Board of Morelia asked if the DSP regist ered graduates from this institution, to \"solve a business\" he had in his locality. In 1934, the DSP did not register Isaac D\u00edaz Espinosa's title; in 1935, Ernesto Guill\u00e9n Ur\u00eda was fined for using the word \"doctor\" in his medical ads; and in the same year sanitary authorities did not allow Petra Guzm\u00e1n Barron to open a homeopathic dispensary. All of them sued the sanitary department with no success, but only the first two obtained their registry in 1939 and 1940 respectively. The case of the registration of titles issued by the ILHM was exceptional; when four of its graduates sued the DSP for not registering their titles in 1942, the SCJN's verdict argued that the school was not officially recognized by the SEP and that the former recognition of this school' s titles did not allow the SEP to perpetuate its error.

C\u00e1rdenas term evidenced a wave of activism from professional groups to regulate professional life. They created the National Confederation of Professional Associations (CNAP) in 1934 .81 This confederation organized congresses that pushed for the regulation of article 4. The C\u00e1mara d e Diputados initiated a project to gather opinions from several professional groups, including homeopaths, about how to elaborate such a regulation .82 Yet led by university physicians, this project also dismissed homeopaths from the discussions .83 The second congress held in 1937 created the National Office to Control and Register Profession Schools and its Degrees (ONCRETP). President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas created the National Polytechnic Institute in 1936. He 81 For the creation of the CNAP and the ONCRE TP and a brief analysis of the regulation of professions in the second half of the 1930s, see Moreno, Yankee Don't Go Home! : Mexican Nationalism, American Business Culture, and the Shaping of Modern Mexico, 1920 -1950 22-3. 82 The interest to regulate arti cle 4 of the constitution dated back to 1917, yet this interest came from professional groups rather than legislators. In the early 1930s, legislators started to approach professional societies to request for their opinions, but the project was never final ized; for instance see AHSS, SP, SJ, 12, 13 and 30, 1, pp. 190, and AHSS, SP, EM, 4, 14. In 1934, with the new President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas leading the country, legislators undertook the project; see homeopath Manuel M\u00e1rquez San Juan's \"Contribuci\u00f3n al studio la de las profesiones en M\u00e9xico\" in AHSS, SP, SJ, 29, 14. The DSP participated actively in this project; see AHSS, SP, SJ, 30, 1 pp. 1 and sigs, and 39, 3. Correspondence from Jos\u00e9 M. Mendoza to the head of the DSP, February 6, 1934, req uesting that the regulation of article 4 was pursued \"with justice\"; and to Deputy Alberto Bremauntz, January 23, 1934, with recommendations for the regulation of article 4; see AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 12, pp. 5 -7, and 8 -11. Mariano Torres Pico submitted a lette r similar to Mendoza's to the President on January 12, 1934; see AHSS, SP, EM, 12, 12, pp. 18. The Mexican Homeopathic League, led by Manuel Mazari, and Guillermo Rodr\u00edguez del Solar, submitted their project for the regulation of article 4 to Deputies Albe rto Bremauntz and Alberto Coria on February 20, 1934; see AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 14, pp. 56 -60. 83 See the article \"De la pol\u00e9mica entre m\u00e9dicos y home\u00f3patas\" by del Dr. Ox\", of Fernando Ocaranza, in El Universal Gr\u00e1fico , January 17, 1934. See also Fernando Ocaranza, \"Discurso Pronunciad o por el (1934). 211 issued the Organic Law of Education in 1939, which gav e back to the SEP the control of the administration to administer of professional private education .84 The following year he drew back the decree of 1930 which gave the ELHM a legal status .85 These institutions and regulations would settle professional dispu tes after 1940, but the presence of graduates from free schools in the medical registry with degrees either revalidated by the SEP or legalized by a Supreme Court's verdict suggests that setting these institutions to work was far from smooth. A detailed analysis of this process remains to be investigated. The DSP kept up with the regulatory shift during C\u00e1rdenas presidential term, reforming the Sanitary Code in 1934. The section on medical practice (See Appendix 3) did not radically differ from the code o f 1926, yet it introduced new articles that gave the DSP authority over local state governments regarding how to regulate medical practice; accommodated the criteria to accept medical titles from free schools according to the contemporary situation of the administration of professional education; and restricted even further medical advertising and practice. The DSP still acknowledged the authority of state governments to regulate professional training and degree granting, but article 442 was clear that it w as DSP's single responsibility to \"dictate government resolutions regarding the practice of medical sciences and related activities.\"86 In terms of medical degrees, though the new code acknowledged that the National University was no longer the institution that validated degrees from free schools, it also 84 See for instance Roberto in Mexico,\" Universities and the Public Sphere: Knowledge Creation and State Building in the Era of Globalization (I nternational Studies in Higher Education) , eds. Brian Pusser, Ken (New York, NY: Routledge and Francis, 2011), vol. ; and Roberto Rodr\u00edguez G\u00f3mez, ed., Entre lo p\u00fablico y lo privado. La las 2003 (M\u00e9xico: \u00c1ngel Porr\u00faa and UPN, 2004). 85 See Diario Oficial de la Federaci\u00f3n, January 23, 1939, p. 4 -5. 86 Taken from \"Un dique al ejercicio de la medicina por charlatanes\", El Universal , September 2, 1934, C\u00f3digo 212 acknowledged that the university's curricula still remained a model for all national medical schools, including free ones. The code was unspecific enough to make clear that federal institutions that authorized free professional schools changed through time, but that the DSP would only accept these schools' degrees when the federal institu tion had the legal right to authorize them. As I will analyze in chapter 6, this condition helped the DSP to actually police medical training. In terms of advertisements, the new code detailed how doctors and practitioners should advertise their services. Every registered practitioner had to advertise their services stating, \"with no abbreviations, the legally authorized sc hool that issued their degrees\" (article 446). Unregistered practitioners had to explicitly advertise that they \"practiced without a de gree\" [\"se ejerce sin t\u00edtulo\"] (article 447). And if registered practitioners used a therapeutic approach which they were not qualified to provide , they needed to advertise that they lacked the degree to use such a therapy. Since sanitary authorities ackno wledged that the code could not regulate the granting of medical degrees, they increased the restrictions to the practice of unregistered practitioners. The code (article 448) made clear that these regulations would also be applicable in states where the p ractice without a medical degree was allowed. Moreover, the code held owners of \"newspapers, radio stations, or experimental stations that offered publicity through radio, projection, or any other means\" responsible for publicity that contravened the sanit ary regulations of medical publicity (article 449). Stating clearly and openly practitioners' professional status and their academic training in a particular therapeutic approach in public medical advertisements was, hence, a public health matter.87 87 Taken from \"Un dique al ejercicio de la medicina por charlatanes\", El Universal , September 2, 1934, reprinted in \"Los Charlatanes y el Nuevo C\u00f3digo Sanitario.\" 213 In ter ms of medical practice, this code eliminated exemptions that the previous one allowed, responding to local regulations. Only registered physicians all over the country, with no exceptions, were required to issue death certificates even in cases of murder, and allowed to offer their professional services as medical experts in private and public institutions (articles 451 and 452). The new code added an article (455) that delineated a code of conduct for practitioners .88 This required all physicians to coopera te with sanitary authorities during an epidemic outbreak; pharmacists to provide what the prescription required and to dispense medicine only to registered practitioners; registered practitioners to prevent sharing their consulting offices with irregulars; and government institutions to stop issuing professional degrees if they lacked any legal authorization. Previous codes had not considered the particular case of homeopathy. The new code regarded this therapeutic approach in a distinctively way in terms o f the prescription of medicines. Article 413 specified that homeopaths could prescribe narcotic drugs only in homeopathic doses, but the section III of article 452 stated that only registered physicians, including dentists, veterinarians, and midwifes, but not homeopaths, could prescribe narcotics drugs. This contradiction indicated the unfruitful efforts to contain the \"fifth plague\", as represented by homeopaths, at the turn of the 1930s. Conclusions The report from Antonio P\u00e9rez Alcocer in 1936 with whic h I initiated this chapter and the reforms of the sanitary code of 1934 to control medical practice offer a good contrast and opportunity to weigh the DPS's efforts to control professional practice during the 1920s and 30s. On one hand, I have analyzed how the revolution brought public health into a central government concern and the government office that administered it, the DSP, into the government institutions 88 It was a code of conduct in the sense that though the code stated that the person who did not fulfill these obligations infringed federal law and attempted against the rights of the society, it is not clear to me how the DSP could prevent such infractions and if it had legal resources to do it. 214 aimed to rule the country. This unprecedented position gave university physicians means throug h which they aimed to impose their view on how to regulate the practice of medicine. Regarded as a public health threat, as \"the fifth plague\", sanitary authorities designed a series of strategies to contain the practice of those who did not fit their stan dards of training. Reforms to the sanitary code, the expansion of sanitary services that were used to police the enforcement of the sanitary code and, hence, medical practice, and negotiations with the SEP to standardize criteria for validating, endorsing, and legalizing medical degrees, were all strategies to cope with the problem sanitary authorities and university physicians called \"medical charlatanism\". These efforts were productive, at first glance. The level of detail in the reforms to the section of medical practice in the sanitary code, the role of sanitary delegates in the states and the sanitary police in Mexico City, and the increasing number of physicians who registered with the DSP show that the effort of sanitary authorities were not worthless and that they sanitized the profession to some extent. On the other hand, the changing role of the UNM with the political power promoted reforms that hindered DSP's efforts to control medical practice. The university's agenda coincided with the DSP's dur ing the first half of the 1920s, a situation evidenced in the sanitary code of 1926, yet the rupture of the UNM with the state in 1929 and the renegotiation of this relationship in 1933 motivated a series of irregularities that the sanitary code of 1934 ai med to remediate. By reading DSP's efforts vis -\u00e0-vis the state's efforts to regulate professional degrees in Mexico City, sanitary measures to control medical practice seem less successful. They suggest that the increasing detail in the section of medical practice of the sanitary code, the increasing presence of the sanitary police in Mexico City and in the states, and the increased population of homeopathic medical doctors in the registry were a consequence of the lack of actual control of 215 the medical prof ession. Without the ability to regulate the granting of medical degrees, sanitary authorities, as P\u00e9rez Alcocer argued, could not be held responsible for the health of the Mexican population. Moreover, that his complain t was raised in 1936, two years after the new sanitary code was issued, is telling of the DSP's limitations to sanitize the medical profession. Besides the conflicts between the UNM and the federal government, there were other political processes that limited the action of sanitary authoriti es. One was the regulation of article 4 of the Constitution . Though I have slightly touched upon some of the actors and conflicts that this process motivated during the 1930s, its study is beyond the scope of this dissertation. Further research needs to be carried out to understand the role of the activism of medical unions in the configuration of the Congress of Professionals [ Congreso de Profesionistas ], the negotiations with the Congress and its projects to regulate article 4, and the intervention of the se groups and the SEP in the creation of the National Office to Control and Register Profession Schools and its Degrees. The other one was the role of graduates from the ELHM and other free medical schools. From chapter 3, we learned that the regulatory e fforts of the UNM first, and the SEP afterwards, both the ENMH and most importantly the ELHM kept up with curricular updates and facility improvement that advances in medical science demanded throughout the 1920s and 30s. In this chapter, we learned that t he ENMH's privileged position within state institutions prevented its graduates from the marginalization that the sanitation of medical practice implied. In this context, it was graduates from free schools the ones who opposed to DSP's regulatory measures. As I will show in the next chapter, their political activism led them to contest the authority of both the UNM and the DSP. This, in turn, influenced sanitary regulations of medical practice and the regulation of professional degrees. 216 Chapter 5 . Between \"the Sword of Public Health and the Wall of the University\": The Free School of Homeopathy of Mexico Contests the \"Sanitary Dictatorship\", 1920 -30 On June 1919, a large group of graduates from the National School of Medicine [ENM] gathered to create the Mexican Medical Association [ Asociaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica Mexicana , AMM] \"with the firm purpose to work towards the union of all physicians in the republic and procure the high ideal of improving physicians' moral, intellectual, and material conditions. \"1 According to Gregorio Mendiz\u00e1bal, President of the AMM, there were several causes that motivated such unifying attempt among which were the \"unprecedented proportions achieved by the illegal practice of the profession and what might be called legal char latanism amongst physicians with degree, which increases everyday greatly harming the interests of the serious physician and the prestige of the profession.\"2 Two years later, the AMM defined homeopathy as one of the principal actors that motivated the lac k of unity of the profession when the Bulletin published the work of Gabino Barreda that criticized homeopathy and subsequently a critique of the merger of the National School of Homeopathic Medicine [ENMH] with the National University of Mexico 1 The new Association gathered more than 200 physicians, most of them from Mexico City, but there were alos members from Tamaulipas. Some of those who lived in Mexico City were key actors in the struggle to marginalize homeopathic medical schools and the practice of their graduates. Among them were former and future heads of the National School of Medicine, i.e. Guillermo Parra, Rosendo Amor, Fernand o Ocaranza; faculty such as Daniel Godoy authorities such Vasconcelos, Alfonso Pruneda, and Francisco Castillo N\u00e1jera; just to mention a few. The Association intended to unionize physicians around 1) a co de of ethics that 2) promoted the production and diffusion of medical science, 3) created the structure to offer financial support and 5) venues to socialize and promote physical culture to its members. The Bulletin of the Association fulfilled the 6th purpose which was to publicize the Association's activities. See \"Asociaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica Mexicana. Ingenieros, la noche del 23 de junio de 1919, con el fin de crear y organizar Asociaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica, M (junio, 1920): 20. 217 [UNM] .3 Yet, as analyzed in chapter 3, ENM faculty members were able to unify medical training at the NUM and turn homeopathy into a medical specialty in 1924. Still homeopathy persisted as an element that divided the medical profession and that opposed the interes ts of the AMM. When ENM faculty achieved the curricular uniformity within the university, the AMM initiated a campaign to attack graduates from the Free School of Homeopathy [ELHM]. ELHM graduates had created the Union of Homeopathic Physicians of the Fede ral District by the end of the 1910s and as such helped organize the Regional Confederation of Workers of Mexico [ Confederaci\u00f3n Regional de Obreros de M\u00e9xico , CROM] in 1918 .4 In 1924, the CROM denounced that the Medical Union [referring to the AMM] which grouped both alopaths and homeopaths from state schools [...] had established a clear and strict campaign against [homeopathic physicians graduated in free schools], who the former considered as incapable of practi cing the honest medical profession.5 The CROM's intervention aimed to \"avoid a profound division in [the medical] profession, because such division would translate into negative consequences not only for workers but for society in general.\"6 The creatio n of professional medical unions, the calls for unity, the actions taken by ENM faculty against the ENMH, and the tensions between the former and the ELHM contradictorily attest to the \"profound division\" that the CROM perceived. 3 The Bulletin published . I. 7 (junio, 1921). For the critique against the merger see Manuel Godoy \u00c1lvarez, \"Con el motivo de la incorporaci\u00f3n I.9 (septiembre, 1921). Please note that this is a reprint of the article he published in Medicina . 4 For the unions that were part of the Regional Confederation of Mexican Workers during its first years see Diane E. Davis, Urban Leviathan : Mexico City in the Twentieth Century (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1994) 48. 5 See correspondence from the CROM to head of the ENM, on July 24, 1924, in AHENM, ENMyA, 351, 3, pp. 1 -2. 6 See correspondence from the CROM to head of the ENM, on July 24, 1924, in AHENM, ENMyA, 351, 3, pp. 1 -2. 218 Indeed, this professional divide had negative consequences for the organization of the medical profession by the end of the 1920s. The policies imposed by the DSP and the UNM to control medical practice and training and that resulted in the marginalization of graduates from free s chools and, particularly, ELHM graduates , led to the latter's political organization as a distinct professional group. As such, they looked for venues to contest the marginalizing policies imposed by both DSP and UNM authorities. Their resistance was effec tive in the sense that they were able to obtain the validation of their degrees and their inclusion in the medical registry. However, ENM graduates who later occupied key positions at the UNM and the DSP did not acknowledge ELHM graduates' status as medica l doctors. The regulatory inconsistency between different levels of government, i.e. federal, state and local, and the lack of enforcement of regulations that were applicable throughout these levels allowed ELHM graduates to privately practice medicine and in some cases issue death certificates, just as homeopathic practitioners did in the 19th century. But they were not incorporated into the state structure in the sense that neither the UNM sanctioned their training nor the DSP acknowledged them as medical doctors. Only when the Mexican state broke its relationship with the UNM, the ELHM and other free schools turned into the political force that the state used to downsize the political power gained by the university during the decade. In this sen se, while the AMM promoted unity, its marginalizing ideologies altogether with the state intervention eventually led to perpetuate the divide the AAM wanted to avoid. This chapter analyzes the forms of resistance of homeopaths since their arrival in Mexic o in the mid -19th century to the year 1930, when President Emilio Portes Gil issued a decree that made the ELHM a legal institution. The purpose is to show that homeopaths' resistance provides a way to measure the limits of professional regulation. Homeopa ths nature as both regular and 219 irregular practitioners and their struggles to belong to the medical profession and be acknowledged as such shows that the dispute between homeopaths and al lopaths was a political rather than an epistemological one. Consequen tly, resistance, marginalization, professional control, and regulation were deeply influenced by the specific state policies in each historical period, the state structures generated to implement such policies, and the particular position of these two prof essional medical groups within these state structures. This chapter, hence, shows how homeopathy evolved as a social movement that resisted the hegemonic process of professionalization from the mid -19th century to the 1920s. The origins of homeopaths' res istance in the 19th century The transition from the Porfirian to the revolutionary state marked a shift not only in public health governance and legislation but also in how doctors and practitioners responded to such a change. During the Porfiriato and par ticularly after the sanitary code was issued in 1891, sanitary authorities found it difficult to enforce the registration of medical doctors in Mexico City. This was a way of resistance I will call passive. Doctors contested sanitary authority by refusing to comply with the medical registry. As I analyzed in the previous chapter, a larger number of doctors in the countryside , in contrast to Mexico City , passively resisted to sanitary measures to regulate the medical profession at the turn of the 20th centur y. In contrast, there were practitioners who actively protested against t he intervention of government authorities in the liberal practice of medicine. During the Porfiriato , this active resistance did not go beyond scattered complaints or even lawsuits , most of which sided on the liberal practice of medicine as stated in article 3 of the Constitution of 1857. This meant that regardless of sanitary authorities' aim to regulate medical practice through the creation of a medical registry and the restriction t o issue death certificates to registered physicians, the government privileged individual liberties 220 over sanitary intervention for the sake of the social good. But after 1917, with a new Constitution and government structure, sanitary authorities' enforcement of the sanitary code on matters of medical practice motivated a more organized and consistent form of active resistance. As a consequence of their status either as foreign physicians or as domes tic healers who did not receive training at the ENM, homeopaths found it difficult to comply with local regulations during the second half of the 19th century, yet they found venues to either become registered physicians or continue their private practice. For instance, in 1859, Ram\u00f3n Comellas and Jos\u00e9 Carb\u00f3 were listed as registered physicians who both practiced homeopathy and had \"degrees from other parts\" .7 Both homeopaths had been registered because the President in turn, Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Ana, had specifically requested the local Superior Board of Health to act against current sanitary legislation. At the time, physicians needed to undertake an examination by ENM's faculty and they needed to have lived in Mexico City for at least two years. Both Comellas and Carb\u00f3 were not examined by the local faculty, yet made it into the registry as consequence of Santa Ana's intervention .8 What the registry's categorization suggests \u2014 they were explicitly catalogued as \"authorized by the supreme government with degrees obtained elsewhere\"9 \u2014 is the board's discomfort as a consequence of being subjected to Presidential decisions in matters of medical practice. This is even more evident by highlighting that there was 7 Reyes, \"M\u00e9dicos, cirujanos, farmac\u00e9uticos, dentistas, flebotomianos, y parteras.\" 8 See Comellas' request to the Superior Board of Health to register his title in AHENM, CSS, 30, 6, pp. 2 - 3. Carb\u00f3's case was slightly different. While Comellas at least tried to be examined by Mexican faculty, Carb\u00f3 wanted to be exempted from such examinat ions. The Superior Board of Health complained about the kind of requests he made and the documents he showed to proof his professional training. Accordingly he first requested to practice homeopathic medicine in December, 1853. The board rejected the petit ion, and one month later, after getting the documents he needed to proof his training, he requested to be exempted from the examination. The board regarded his petitions as both illegal and indicative of his unwillingness to proof his command of medical sc ience. See Jos\u00e9 Carb\u00f3's petition to practice medicine in the Mexican Republic. AHENM, CSS, 31, 1, pp. 1 -4. The Superior Board of Health described the legal situation of homeopaths living in Mexico City at the time, including Comellas' and Carbo's in the co rrespondence with the governor of Mexico City, July 3, 1855 and July 13, 1855; in AHSS, SP, EM, 2, farmac\u00e9uticos, flebotomianos, y parteras.\" 221 one other physician, Pascual Bielsa, who openly practiced homeopathy and owned a homeopathic dispensary in 1859, yet was included in the registry but not distinguished as a homeopath ;10 or that there were homeopaths, such as Narciso Sanchiz who could not actually make it to the registry .11 Comellas' and Carbo's actions constitute one subclass of active resistance, one that trained physicians who did not comply with local sanitary regulations undertook. These physicians did have a regular, academic medical training and their actions suggest that they wante d to become part of the growing medical marketplace, one that the sanitary legislation wanted to regulate restricting the participation of new actors, such as homeopaths or foreign physicians. When the homeopathic community fragmented at the turn of the 1 870s and homeopathic physicians sought for legal venues to become active members of the larger medical community (see chapter 2), homeopaths who lacked an ENM's degree sought other ways to resist sanitary strategies that marginalized their practices. Facin g the enforcement of sanitary regulation in 1871 ,12 Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez struggled to remain in charge of his homeopathic dispensary .13 The legal 10 See for instance Pascual Bielsa, \"Discurso de Pascual Bielsa en el his homeopathic dispensary on 1858; see AHSS, SP, EM, 3, 53. 11 Narciso Sanchiz was a Spanish homeopath, who apparently had gr aduated as Doctor in medicine and surgery from Valencia and Madrid. See AHENM, CSS, 31, 9, pp. 1 -7 (The catalogue referred that \"Narchiso S\u00e1nchez y Rubio\" petitioned an examination from the ENM's faculty, yet the documents in the file were from Dr. Gamble) . He petitioned a written examination instead of an oral one to the Superior Sanitary Board in January 1855, since he had \"lost his voice in a quarrel\". Three months later, the Board denounced him to the local police for \"publicly offering his medical serv ices, arguing he [was] a homeopathic physician, without being examined, approved or authorized by the government for such a practice.\" The Board rescheduled a new examination for Sanchiz, but apparently he did not comply with it for the local government no tified him not to continue practicing medicine. See Correspondence from Narciso Sanchiz to the Governor of Mexico City, Jos\u00e9 Noriega, January 18, 1855.

For this purpose it published a poster that ratified the Board's obligations amo ng which figured \"4a.

For instance, Gonz\u00e1lez' homeopathic dispensary continued open throughout the Porfiriato and Gonz\u00e1lez continued offering his homeopathic services .14 In 1875, Alfredo R. de Santillana, won a lawsuit against the government of practitioners fulfill their legal duties.\" In the same vein, the Penal Code is sued in 1871 ruled that those who practiced \"medicine, surgery, obstetrics, or pharmacy without a legal medical degree would be fined with a year in prison and a fine from 100 to 1000 pesos.\" See \"Aviso importante\".

In 1972, the Ministerio de Gobernaci\u00f3n [Ministry of Interior] ratified the SBH duties to carry out inspections on public and commercial establishments.

Agostoni explains that medical practitioners complained that such legislation was rarely set into practice. See C\u00f3digo Penal durante el Porfiriato,\" 16. 13 While originally the government supported the regular status of his dispensary arguing that the SBH had authorized it in 1868, Gonz\u00e1lez needed to find someone else to be in charge of his pharmacy in 1871. Enrique Chavari who had graduated from the ENM agreed to be in charge, and the SBH and the government conceded the permission. When Chavari resigned after a few days of his new appointment, the government allowed Gonz\u00e1lez to be in charge of his dispensary as his owner but not as a professional, not making clear what this specifically mea nt. It is unclear whether the SBH required him to have a professional degree issued by the ENM, or of it specifically required him to have a degree of pharmacy. The ad issued on May 26, 1868 was not clear if the person in charge of a dispensary or drug sto re needed to have either a medical or a pharmaceutical degree. Article 4 said that the SBH had to verify that only \"legally authorized professors practiced the medical sciences, and that they fulfill all responsibilities of its own facultad [profession]\". Article 12 prevented that only pharmacists could engage in the commerce of medicines. Article 49 said that whenever the commission visited a dispensary \"the professor has to show its degree\", without specifying if it needed to a degree in pharmacy or medic ine.

For Gonz\u00e1lez's case see correspondence between the governme nt of the Federal District, the Superior Sanitary Board and the Ministry of Governance, AHSS, SP, EM, 3, 54. 14 The situation of Pascual Bielsa's dispensary is contradictory. On one side he was included in the medical registry of 1859 as a regular doctor a nd had a homeopathic dispensary since 1858. On the other, his dispensary was apparently closed in 1871. While the government originally supported Bielsa's dispensary to remain open arguing that a decade -long provision of homeopathic medicine without any complaints from his patients attested that he \"did not offend the rights of the society\", and regardless of the legal status of his medical degree, eventually the SBH closed his dispensary down. But due to the liberal constitution of 1857, it is unlikely tha t he remain passive after such an outcome, as the case of Medical Homeopathic Mexican Society suggests. See correspondence between Pascual Bielsa, the 223 Guanajuato who attempted to prohibit his homeopathic practice and his selling of \"specialties\" .15 This was a particular route exploited by practitioners who did not have a legal degree throughout the Porfiriato . In his critique, Eduardo Lavalle y Carbajal offered four examples to show how the Supreme Court of Justice valued individual liberties (article 3 and 4 of the Constitution of 1857), which even threatened the life of others, over the health of the population, when allowing practitioners to offer their services without a degree, sell dangerous medicines, validate their degrees across the states, and overcome restrictions imposed by administrative authorities .16 The req uest that Manuel Vald\u00e9s y Morelos, president of the Medical Homeopathic Mexican Society [ Sociedad M\u00e9dico -Homeop\u00e1tico Mexicana ], made to the government of Mexico City in 1878 deserves a special attention for two reasons. First, this society grouped homeopat hic practitioners in 1875 and represented them since then, once homeopathic physicians created their own. Second, the outcome of this request evidences the government's position regarding the practice of healers who did not have professional medical traini ng in the National School of Medicine .17 Vald\u00e9s y Morelos requested that all affiliates of the Society could issue death certificates. He argued that all members had a diploma [a degree] issued by the Society and that they paid income taxes as a result of t heir professional practice. But in an analysis to this petition, E. Escudero, an officer of the local government, argued that while in grammatical terms these homeopaths were profesores [professionals], in legal terms they were not because they had not rec eived a degree from a legally established institution that certified minister of Governance, the government of the Federal District and the Superior Sanitary Board, AHSS, SP, EM, 3, 53. 15 \"La homeopat\u00eda en M\u00e9xico,\" faro homeop\u00e1tico Mexicana.\" 224 they had the technical medical knowledge .18 If, he continued, death certificates were to be the legal foundation of public administration in matters of just ice and health \u2014 through them a jury could decide on the criminal nature or not of a particular death, or the sanitary administration could decide which course to take in the outbreak of epidemic diseases \u2014 they needed to be issued by legal experts. For this reason, he concluded, the state could not regard any person who practiced healing \u2014 let alone medicine \u2014 a legal expert, but those who had legal degrees. By not fulfilling the legal requirements that the state demanded for issuing death certificates, homeopathic practitioners were marginalized from the state's bureaucratic apparatus. Practice was a different matter. Escudero argued that by taxing homeopaths' activities, the government acknowledged the pr ofitability of their private professional practice, but not their status as legal experts. In these sense, he interpreted articles 3 and 4 of the Constitution in this particular case as homeopaths' right to heal and of particulars to seek their services. U nder such criterion, the government officer clearly delimited the regulatory role of the state. It did not intervene in the private teaching and practice of medicine. Rather, acknowledging medical practice as a profitable activity, it demanded the correspo nding tax. For this reason the local government allowed the liberal practice of homeopathy, whether in the privacy of interpersonal or epistolary patient -doctor interactions, or in the public advertising and exchanges taking place in homeopathic dispensari es, consulting rooms, and the printed media. What the state was not willing to allow was that any unofficial institution intervened with state matters. In other words, 18 The explanation was somewhat more complex. In Mexico City the Board of Instruction issued professional degrees once students had passed their own school's examinations. Both schools and the Board of Instruction were \"legal institutions that worked under legal authorization and consequently their acts were deemed official.\" The Sociedad M\u00e9dico -Homeop\u00e1tica Mexicana was not such an institution and consequently its graduates, regardless of the nature of their doctrine, could not participate on official acts as professionals. 225 it would not allow that a degree issued by an organization established by a group of peo ple paved the way to their involvement in official matters. Under the legal and political setting established after the Wars of Reform and during the Porfiriato , there was not space for legal or political dissent or resistance by irregular practitioners, p articularly homeopaths. On one side, regular homeopathic doctors had used their position to push regulations in favor of and public spaces for homeopathic practice. Regulations in Veracruz, Puebla, and Mexico City (see chapter 2) had established the requir ements to obtain a government -issued homeopathic medical degree. These regulations went together with the creation of hospital wards in Puebla, and a hospital in Mexico City, and homeopathic schools in both of the latter. With these regulations and institu tions, properly trained homeopathic physicians with a legal medical degree could teach and practice medicine, including homeopathy, in government institutions. Yet, neither were homeopathic hospitals and schools entirely integrated into larger government i nstitutions such as local sanitary boards or local ministries of education ,19 nor were homeopathic physicians entirely accepted in the medical community. In other words, state authorities pushed the creation of homeopathic institutions and the formulation o f ad hoc laws that granted homeopathic physicians a place in regular professional life. But rather than integrating professional medical institutions, this effort perpetuated the division between homeopathic and allopathic institutions. By mainstreaming homeopathy, the state promoted the division of the medical profession .20 On the other, articles 3 and 4 of the Constitution of 1857 provided the legal venue through which practitioners who did 19 Whether local sanitary boards in Puebla and Veracruz acknowledged such regulations in homeopathic training in the 19th century is an issue that demands further research. In the cas e of Mexico City, Porfirio D\u00edaz created the National School of Homeopathic Medicine, but it was controlled by the Ministry of the Interior, rather than the Ministry of Justice and Public Instruction. 20 For an extended argument of how ENM graduates and homeopathic medical doctors conceived themselves as opposites see Carrillo, \"\u00bfIndivisibilidad o bifuraci\u00f3n de la ciencia?: La institucionalizacion de la homeopat\u00eda en M\u00e9xico.\" 226 not have access to regular medical training and consequently could not comply with regulations that favored trained physicians could indeed practice medicine in private institutions or their home. In other words, the liberal Constitution of 1857 and the regulations of the Porfiriato provided a legal and economic space wh ere all sorts of medical practitioners, elite and lower - class, traditional and modern, scientifically or domestically trained, urban and rural, could offer their services. What I have just described as forms of resistance are just the roots of dissent, fo rms of actions taken by different actors according to their social status within the medical profession, mostly in Mexico City, during the second half of the 19th century. These were taken according to the resources they had at hand. Comellas, Carb\u00f3, and l ater homeopaths such as those who founded the National Homeopathic Hospital [HNH] and the ENMH were medical doctors by training and enjoyed the social, cultural, and economic position that such training gave them. Their active acts of resistance resulted w hen they perceived that the larger community of physicians, mostly ENM graduates, did not embrace them. Practitioners such as Gonz\u00e1lez, and the members of the Medical Homeopathic Mexican Society did not have the privilege of influencing the high government spheres to create legislations that favored them. Consequently, they actively resisted by using the existing legislation that allowed their practice. During the Porfiriato , particularly with the ENMH and the HNH, acts of resistance were isolated, short - termed, and geographically restricted. But with the Department of Public Health sanitizing the medical profession during the 1920s and 30s this situation radically changed. \"In homeopaths' defense\": ELHM graduates seek DSP's recognition The reorganization o f the Ministry of Public Education [SEP] and the Department of Public Health [DSP] at the turn of the 1920s left the Free School of Homeopathy [ELHM] out of 227 any regulatory government institution that could have legalized its academic curriculum and medical degrees. As I analyzed in chapter 3, however positive G\u00f3mez's and Dosal's comments about the school's pedagogic plan and facilities were and whatever promises Vasconcelos made to support the ELHM, this school's graduates were in a position similar to that of homeopathic practitioners during the Porfiriato . Regardless of receiving a similar training to that of ENMH graduates, the contemporary sanitary regulation did not acknowledge ELHM graduates as true medical experts, as evidenced in the medical registry during the 1920s. Consequently the DSP limited or more accurately ruled out their participation in the basic public administration act where doctors could participate in, the issuing of death certificates. Just as homeopathic doctors did during the Porfir iato, these graduates wanted to be part of the new government organization, complying with regulations of the Ministry of Public Education [SEP], the UNM, and the DSP. But they considered that their training, the Constitution , and the legal status of their school entitled them to be treated as the rest of medical doctors trained in state -sponsored medical schools. In a sense, this group of homeopathic doctors combined the sensibilities of both homeopathic doctors and practitioners during the Porfiriato regarding their marginalization by state authorities. The enforcement of the sanitary code in 1920 revived the problem of marginalizing homeopaths, particularly ELHM graduates, by not allowing them to issue death certificates. This motivated their active mobi lization to request the DSP's acknowledgement of ELHM degrees as legal. The reaction of ELHM graduates was not immediate. It took them two years after the DSP required physicians all over the nation to report their names, addresses, and titles, and issued the new legislation about medical registration and advertising. On June 24, 1922, Querido Moheno, representing Facundo Hidalgo and 50 graduates from this school, addressed the head of the DSP, 228 Gabriel Malda, complaining about the restrictive attitude of th e sanitary department .21 Moheno argued that the DSP's refusal to register ELHM medical degrees impacted on their practice. Particularly, civilian courts in the Federal District would not accept their death certificates. For that reason, the homeopaths' lawy er demanded that the DSP acknowledged the legal status of ELHM degrees. If this happened, then they could be included in the medical registry and official institutions would accept their services and certificates. The lawyer based his demands on the analys is of articles 3, 4, and 73, paragraph XXVII, of the Constitution; resolutions of the Supreme Court of Justice [ Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Naci\u00f3n, hereon SCJN] whose verdict had allowed the practice of homeopaths and pharmacists a few years earlier; o pinions of government authorities about the quality of education provided by the ELHM; and the possible role that homeopaths could play in the provision of medical services in rural populations. According to his analysis of the Constitution of 1917, art icles 3 and 4 allowed free secular education and free professional practice, respectively. The paragraph XXVII of article 73 allowed the Federal Congress to open professional schools. This latter article no longer existed by 1922, due to a modification in the Constitution on June 30, 1919, but Moheno believed that since Higinio G. P\u00e9rez created the ELHM when this paragraph was still ruling, the school remained legal. He argued that no other regulation could stand above the Federal Constitution, 21 The homeopaths were Facundo Hidalgo, David P\u00e9rez, la Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Uni\u00f3n,\" vol., 9 - 29. See also ASSP, SP, EM, 4, 15, pp. 6 - 19. 229 and that it was not legally possible to retroactively enforce new legislations. This interpretation of the Federal Constitution was supported by verdicts from the SCJN too; for instance, on August 28, 1920, Juan Berm\u00fadez, and Juana C. Viuda de , graduates from the Free Homeopathic School of Puebla, won a lawsuit against the governor of the state, who \"being an allopathic physician put obstacles to the professional practice of these homeopaths.\"22 Intellectual elites and government authorities also had an opinion against the regulation of professions and in favor of the ELHM, and Moheno cited them in his letter. For instance, Antonio Caso, dean of the UNM, and founder of the Ateneo de la Juventud , a group of intellectuals who promoted the diffusion of humanistic culture and fought against positivistic education and politics in the 1910s, believed that there was no need for a regulation of professions. So did Ezequiel A. Ch\u00e1vez, founder of the Nationa l University in 1910, Guillermo Parra, promoter of positivism in the late Porfiriato, and Manuel Puga y Acal, secretary of the National University in 1922. They believed that titles where only a warrant of technical proficiency, but in no way represented a right to practice certain profession. Donato Moreno's, Gildardo G\u00f3mez's and Fortunato Dozal's opinions about facilities, faculty, and students at the ELHM were above those they had of the ENMH, in the report they submitted to Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos in 1922 (see chapter 3). Moreno believed that the free school had better chances to become a good medical school in the future, though it lacked infrastructure to provide a proper medical education at that moment .23 Moreover, Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos, also a member of the Ateneo 22 de Suprema Corte de la Uni\u00f3n,\" vol., 17. 23 Besides Donato Moheno's letter see the report to Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos dated September 15, 1920, Juventud , and Dean of the UNM in 1920, sent an official letter to the ELHM that year declaring that, though the university didn't have the right to validate degrees from free schools, it believed that ELHM's \"should have\" at least the same status as the ones from the ENMH, because they had a similar academic curriculum. Querido Moheno believed that besides legal arguments and favorable opinions, there were also practical reasons that made the medical practice of homeopaths ideal to solve the old problem of the provision of appropriate medical services to the Mexican population. The lower classes poor access to medical services or the poor quality of the latter was an issue that pervaded during the Porfiriato and that sanitary and educational autho rities tried to solve after the civil war in a similar fashion as Porfirio Diaz's government did, namely by controlling professional education and establishing a medical registry. But Querido Moheno argued that those measures did not solve the problem. For instance, he argued that the official medical school did not provide enough \"allopaths\" to cope with the demand of those practitioners in poor urban neighborhoods or rural areas, and the ones who practiced medicine preferred to stay in urban centers than live a harsh domestic lifestyle with a poor professional future in the countryside. Moreover, this attitude left the local healer, the pharmacists, or the quack an opportunity to fulfill the popular need for medicines and cures. On the contrary, the lawyer argued that the ELHM relieved the state from the burden to provide medical education to the poor class, and graduates could provide free medical services \u2014 as they already did \u2014 in the dispensaries and hospital that the ELHM sponsored. Moreover, he contin ued, homeopathy was a cheap medicine, since in case patients consulted a private homeopath, the prize of the medical consultation included medicines. conmotivo de las visitas que a las subscripto.\" 231 Gabriel Malda's reply to homeopaths' demands was not immediate. He even took more time than Moheno could stand. On August 1, five weeks after Moheno submitted his first letter, the homeopaths' lawyer requested that Dr. Malda provide an answer to his demands. Malda replied two weeks later that the commission integrated by Dr. Francisco Castillo N\u00e1jera, head of the Office of Medical Practice, and lawyer Antonio Ramos Pedrueza, legal advisor of the DSP, was studying the case .24 Moheno personally talked to members of the commission, but with no results. The commission spent two months before it could decide the bes t course of action, and once it did, the department was relieved from any responsibility to reply to homeopaths' demands. On October 17, the department's commission decided that the DSP could not make any official statement about the legality of degrees is sued by the ELHM because that was the SEP's responsibility .25 In the resolution, Castillo N\u00e1jera and Ramos Pedrueza argued that the department did not want to disagree with the Constitution, but the department's duty was to enforce the Sanitary Code which i n its articles 242 and 244 clearly stated that only legal titles could be registered. With the resolution in hand, Gabriel Malda addressed Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos on October 20, to inquire if the SEP academically supervised the ELHM, and whether its medical degr ees were legal. If this was the case, the DSP also wanted to know since when. Gabriel Malda also requested information about the legality of the degrees of the homeopaths Moheno represented. The head of the DSP informed the homeopaths' lawyer about this ne w administrative process, but Moheno was eager to have a resolution from the department and insisted on October 28 to have an official statement from the sanitary department. Without the response from the SEP, Malda consulted the case with the DSP's counci l, which decided to officially reply that what 24 Correspondence to Gabriel Malda, October 28, 1922, in Moheno, \"En la Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Uni\u00f3n,\" vol., 30. 25 See \"Dictamen\" in the A SSP, SP, EM, 4, 15, p. 22. 232 homeopaths demanded was beyond DSP's attributions and consequently it could not state anything about the legality of homeopaths' degrees .26 Coincidently, the same day that Malda officially replied to Moheno, An tonio Caso addressed the head of the DSP in response of his inquiry to the SEP, notifying that the National University did not validate titles issued by free schools .27 The exchange of correspondence between Moheno, the DSP, and the SEP raises questions ab out the motivations behind both Moheno's and Malda's actions. The legal and administrative structure in the early -1920s government institutions seems pretty straightforward. The SEP was responsible for all professional state -sponsored schools in Mexico Cit y, having the UNM as the office that administered them, and the DSP was responsible to carry out sanitary measures by enforcing the sanitary code. If this is the case, why did Donato Moheno address the DSP requesting an official statement about the legalit y of homeopaths' degrees when the SEP and more particularly the UNM were the offices responsible to validate degrees? Moreover, being presided by Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos, and Antonio Caso, intellectuals who participated in a movement in the late 1900s and early 1 910s that promoted liberal education to the working class, the SEP and the UN seemed a better option than the DSP to address the demand to validate degrees issued by free schools. Regardless of not taking any official position about the education of homeop aths, DSP's officer of the department of medical practice believed that the lack of infrastructure of the ELHM produced physicians who lacked the required technical preparation. He considered that even if students passed theoretical exams, the lack of hosp itals to do clinical practices, cadaver s to study anatomy, and laboratories to learn histology, bacteriology, and physiology, made the school unsuitable to properly prepare its students for professional 26 Correspondence from the DSP to Querido Moheno of November 14, 1922, in A SSP, SP, EM, 4, 15, pp. 29 and 34 . 27 November 14, see correspondence in A SSP, SP, EM, 4, 15, p. 28 . 233 practice .28 If Querido Moheno already knew about the n egative attitudes of elite physicians against homeopaths, evidenced by his correspondence, there were no apparent reasons to address his demand to the DSP, rather than the SEP. The actions taken by the DSP seem contradictory too, particularly if a clear demarcation of the secretary's attributions is assumed. If a pronunciation on the legality of homeopaths' degrees was beyond DSP's responsibilities, why did it take four months to resolve this, and to require the intervention of the SEP? Why did Castillo N\u00e1jera and Ramos Pedrueza take so long to dictate the course of action that sanitary authorities should follow in this case? Sanitary authorities were cautious, since an immediate negative response might have been considered an authoritarian act of elite physicians who wanted to put out of the game all their professional competitors. This caution might have increased because the opinions of Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos, Antonio Caso, and Ezequi el Ch\u00e1vez provided by Querido Moheno in his letter might have worried sanitary authorities. For, if these notorious intellectuals and government officers sponsored free schools, then the entire project to regulate the medical profession under the DSP's criteria, leaving free schools outside of the medical registry, was threatened, at least in Mexico City. The attitude of sanitary authorities motivated a series of responses from graduates, but their actions were anticipated by an exchange between Luis Rivas Cruz, a doctor from Tamaulipas, one of the northern states of Mexico, and President \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n. This correspondence exchange is unique because while showing that Rivas Cruz agreed upon the sanitary dictatorship \u2014 apparently he participated in the disc ussions that made public health a central concern in the Constitution and the Department of Pub lic Health federal jurisdiction \u2014 it 28 See Francisco Castillo N\u00e1jera's \"Opinion\" and the comission's \"Dictamen\" of October 17, 1922, in the ASSP, SP, EM, 4, 15, pp. 21 -22. 234 also evidenced how Rivas Cruz regarded DSP's attitudes against ELHM graduates as intransigent. Rivas Cruz complained about t he bloody, intense campaign of the [DSP...] against free schools, evidencing that the worst enemy of Mexican people was Mexican people. University and Boards accept doubtful foreign diplomas. Maybe to flatter foreign people, they furiously attack national i nstitutions, legal by the Constitution , and accepted [...] Scornful official monopolistic sectarianism.29 President Obreg\u00f3n replied that he had no knowledge of what was happening and turned Rivas Cruz's telegram to Gabriel Malda .30 The latter went to back to the President saying that the DSP was only abstaining from registering ELHM's medical degrees and that a final resolution to Moheno's request was in due course .31 Rivas Cruz sent President Obregon a long letter describing the situation, which was no differ ent than what Moheno had demanded, particularly regarding article 73, fraction 27 . According to Rivas Cruz, doctors who graduated from free schools should have demanded their rights and sued civilian registries, instead of going to \"physicians with a legal degree\" to \"beg\" for death certificates. Such an attitude, he continued, inflated the pride of the Superior Board of Health and when the enemies of the revolution [...] entered the Board in 1920, chest up, and certain that they could step on the law with i mpunity, and overwhelmed by the success of physicians from free schools, especially those from the [ELHM...], the Board agreed to shot a 'UKASE' with no preamble ,32 29 Telegraph from L.

See correspondence from Gabriel Malda to President Obreg\u00f3n, on Nov 10, 1922, in AHELHM. 32 See c orrespondence from L. Rivas Cruz to President Obreg\u00f3n, on Nov 11, 1922, in AHELHM. \"Enemies of the revolution\" is a term that might well be referring to members of the Mexican Medical Association, such as Gabriel Malda, Alfonso Pruneda, and Francisco Castillo Najera, who had key positions in the new DSP and initiated the campaign against charlatanism both within the Association and the department. The association had been created in 1919 by a large group of ENM graduates with the aim to protect the interests of the profession. When Vasconc elos merged the ENMH to the UNM they agreed to work in favor of a homogenous medical curriculum in the whole nation. See \"Asociaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica Mexicana. Su M\u00e9dica Mexicana,\" Asociaci\u00f3n 235 referring to the regulations issued by the DSP in 1920. Rivas Cruz believed that the DSP wou ld never reply to Moheno's request because \"the wise Department feels very comfortable, laughing of the Revolution and the law\".33 He finalized by acknowledging that some states registered degrees of free schools but that many others followed DSP's criterion. Perhaps for Rivas Cruz's sensibilities, graduates from free schools should have taken a more active form of resistance, one that actually acknowledged their rights and fought for them, rather than a passive one, aimed to comply with sanitary impositions. ELHM graduates' response to the DSP's rejection to acknowledge the legality of their degrees was not as passive as Rivas Cruz presumed. It is true that some of them wanted to comply with government regulations and tried to validate their degree with the UNM. Just at the turn of 1923, a few months after the DSP replied to Moheno that it could not give any opinion about the legalit y of ELHM degrees, brothers Aliber and Eliud Garc\u00eda Trevi\u00f1o requested to the NUM that their medical degrees were revalidated. They had studied at the National Highschool [Escuela Nacional Preparatoria ], the Free School of Homeopathy, New York University, a nd the University of Chicago. Then Eliud had practiced at the Hahnemann Hospital in New York and the Hospital of Essex County in Newark, New Jersey .34 Following university's regulations, Dean Antonio Caso endorsed their high -school and post -graduate certifi cates, but consulted with Luis Porragas, head of the ENMH at the time, about the revalidation of their medical degree. Porragas replied that in his opinion only the National Highschool's degree could be regarded as legal; titles from foreign institutions c ould be taken into consideration, and only because the M\u00e9dica Mexicana.

Rather he suggested that they took a professional examination as if they had requested to be incorporated to the homeopathic faculty .36 Eventually, the ENMH examined and passed Aliber ,37 but Eliud did not go through all the process. Having passed the examinations and according to the university's and the homeopathic school's regulations, Aliber received a legal homeopathic medical degree from the ENMH. It is important to note that his case was successful not because he had a degree from the ELHM, in fact this was not even considered in the process of validation, rather, because of his foreign medical degrees and his complying with ENMH's legal requirements. The unsuccessful case of Eliud highlights the limits of this venue. Aliber's process raised ENMH's students concerns about the non observance of ENMH regulations .38 Apparently, after Aliber's successful case, Eliud requested to resume th e process to revalidate his degree. But ENMH students demanded his petition did not proceed. They argued that Eliud's request had the 35 See reponse from Luis Porragas to UNAM's Dean in AHUNAM, CU, 13, 92, pp. 121 7. 36 In the school's reformed regulation of 1916 such an examination required that if physicians who wanted to incorporate to the homeopathic faculty had studied at a foreign medical school and such school had reciprocity agreements with the National Universit y, then these physicians needed to write a thesis on a topic related to homeopathic doctrine, be subjected to an oral examination about Materia medica, homeopathic therapeutics, or homeopathic doctrine, and finally diagnose, offer a prognosis, and suggest a treatment to three patients, one surgical and two medical, from the National Homeopathic Hospital. See articles 31 -39 of the \"REGLAMENTO de la Escuela Nacional de de la de M\u00e9xico\", AHSS, BP, HNH, 1, 28, 18 -23. 37 Aliber took th e examinations, but the examining committee decided that he should spend one year of studies at the ENMH before presenting the exam for a second time. After six months Aliber requested to take his general examination again, and the committee of the ENMH ag reed, examined him and passed him. See the description of the process by the Society of Students from the Faculty of Homeopathic Medicine in A HUNAM, CU, 13, 92, pp. 1217 and 1219. 38 See their complaints to the Univesity's Dean in A HUNAM, CU, 13, 92, pp. 1218 - 1219. 237 same irregularities as his brother's .39 The University's Council formed a committee which decided that Aliber's professiona l exam was valid, but before the committee presented its resolution about Eliud's case, he desisted from taking the exam .40 He concluded in his letter that he desisted from the process because on one side his degrees were worth enough to freely practice his profession, widely accredited by his clientele who paid the prize they considered his services worth of; on the other it was shameful to beg for an exam for accreditation [examen a t\u00edtulo de suficiencia ], as if it was a favor or a grace that many requeste d, bowing their heads. I wanted [to be examined] to prove to the Nation that the money spent on my allowance [when I was] abroad was not worthless.41 In other words, while attainable, this venue did not work on the ground. On one side, because ENMH's inter nal regulations required that accrediting examinations [ ex\u00e1menes a t\u00edtulo de suficiencia ] were comprehensive, meaning that the examinee undertook an exam per each of the courses in the ENMH's academic curriculum. This might have resulted overwhelming for ELHM graduates, who had already pursued a medical curriculum that ultimately was pretty similar to the one offered at the ENMH. On the other, because while ENMH authorities facilitated the process in some instances, this motivated concerns within the ENMH's students community which demanded that those who wanted to have their degrees validates went through the requirements that ENMH internal regulations demanded. Judging by the actions taken by most of ELHM graduates, they were not willing to advertise their services as practitioners without a legal medical degree. Finding no access to the medical registry, they turned to the active forms of resistance suggested by Rivas Cruz's correspondence. 39 Namely that it did not comply with school's regulations, that he did not hold a legal professional medical degree, and that Aliber and head of the ENMH had violated the decision of the examining committee to let him wait a year before taking the second examination. 40 For the committee to resolve this case see A HUNAM, CU, 14, 97, p. 1360. 41 For Eliud Garc\u00eda Trevi\u00f1o's letter see AHUNAM, CU, 13, 92, p. 1216. Moheno's inconformity with the DSP's resolution of November 1922 led him to take the case to the courts, where sanitary and legal authorities and homeopathic doctors expressed how different their interpretation of the Constitution was. Moheno sued the DSP in a local civilian court using similar arguments to the ones exp osed in his letter .42 The sanitary department argued that the sanitary code only regulated the medical profession exclusively on the issuing of death certificates and that there was no law that made either the ELHM or its degrees legal .43 The judge sided wit h the DSP, arguing that medical practice was reduced to the diagnosis of diseases and the ministering of the appropriate remedies, and that the issuing of death certificates was an expert opinion and consequently regulated as such. Regarding the interpreta tion of article 73 of the Constitution, the local civilian court believed that free schools needed to be created or authorized directly by the Congress in order to be legal, an authorization that the ELHM lacked. For these reasons this court concluded that the sanitary department's response to Moheno was appropriate and legal. Moheno did not agree with the civilian court's verdict and demanded a revision of the case to the SCJN, which overruled the original verdict .44 For the Supreme Court, the ELHM had been created before the Constitution was even dictated. Consequently, it was a legal institution to which the article 73 of the Constitution did not apply. The corollary of the Supreme Court's argumentation was that the sanitary code was against the Constitution when it regulated medical practice. 42 The trial was on April 5, 1923. The transcript of the resolution of the case is in Moheno, \"En defensa de los Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Uni\u00f3n,\" vol., 43 - 65. 43 The civil court required an opinion and recount of facts by the DSP. The DSP replied on December 8, 1922, see A HSS, SP, EM, 4, 15, pp. 35-37. 44 The document requesting the revision to the Supreme Court of Justice is dated on April 23, 1923. See Querido Moheno's document that demands the revision of the lawsuit in A HSS, SP, EM, 4, 15, pp. 64-66. See also a 239 Sanitary authorities were determined to ban homeopaths from the medical registry. With characteristic legal and administrative audacity, the DSP dismissed the Supreme Court's legal interpretation and acted strictly according to what homeopaths explicitly demanded. In their demand to the SCJN, Moheno literally demanded that sanitary authorities officially stated, in agreement with the President, their position about the legality of ELHM degrees. On June 25, 1925, the DSP sent a letter to President Plutarco El\u00edas Calles summarizing the events during all this legal process and the reasons behind sanitary authorities' actions . This letter concluded with a suggestion of resolution to the President, \"Tell Mr. Facundo Hidalgo and its associates that, regarding their correspondence of June 24, 1922, it is not possible for the DSP to respond to their petition because it is beyond its responsibilities\".45 By this time Plutarco El\u00edas Calles had already an opinion about free schools, since he had already legislated against their legality, so DSP's letter was only a formality and a legal requirement. The sanitary department did not register the titles of graduates from the ELHM, as evidenced in the medical registry .46 The Limits of the \"Sanitary Dictatorship\": Contesting the Sanitary Legislation at the Ground Level and Changing the Legislation from the Bottom Up Finding the long, both legal and administrative, procedures of the bureaucratic appar atus ineffective to their purposes, ELHM graduates sought other ways to establish a legal practice. They took advantage of article 121 of the Constitution which dictated that professional degrees issued by each state government must be accepted by any othe r one. This constitutional right opposed the aim of the DSP to centralize the control of the medical profession and of the SEP, particularly the UNM, to regulate professional training at the national level. Some states used 45 Correspondence from the head of the office of legal affairs of the DSP to the head of the DSP, J une 25, 1925. This letter is a draft of the document that was given to the President. A HSS, SP, EM, 4, 15, pp. 77- 80. 46 There is no graduate of the Free School of Homeopathy registered in the Homeopathic Physician's Titles Registry before 1930. 240 this prerogative to mark their i ndependence from central regulations but others sided on a homogenous regulatory framework and aligned with the federal government. Consequently, ELHM graduates used these inconsistencies with relative success. States such as Hidalgo (1917)47 and Morelos ( 1925 -6)48 regarded medical degrees issued by private medical schools such as the ELHM to be legal . In the case of Morelos, th e government even issued official degrees to ELHM graduates. The timing and sequence of steps took by the government of Morelos sugg ests an open reaction to DSPH attitude against the ELHM and the UNM's attitude against free schools. The governor of Morelos issued a decree on October 20, 1925, just four months after the DSP finally resolved the case of ELHM graduates, setting on the leg ality of degrees issued by this and the Free School of Law. A few months later, on January 31, 1926, he authorized the issuing of state issued degrees to graduates from these schools. If the governor wanted graduates from free schools to become legal pract itioners in the whole country, he could only do it through the second decree. It is unclear how effective this action was. The registry of homeopaths does not include any entry from a homeopath with a degree issued by a state government, or by a free schoo l before 1930. In the state of Yucat\u00e1n this strategy did not work. Local sanitary authorities had always been concerned about homeopaths entering the regular practice of medicine, even if their degrees were legal, but once the DSP enforced the control of the medical profession, local sanitary authorities followed DSP's guidelines. In 1919, the ENMH requested the government of Yucat\u00e1n to accept the former's medical degrees, but the local Sanitary Board, making veiled critiques of the homeopathic system, dec ided not to accept the degrees, based on the authority of the local 47 The decree was published on November 15, 1919; see \"En favor de la ense\u00f1anza\", El Universal , 12, 1919. 48 Escuela y los art\u00edculos 3o. y 4o. constitucionales 16. 241 state to authorize and regulate medical practice. The Sanitary Board decided that ENMH graduates had to pass an examination like graduates from other medical schools, an examination where the Board expected that homeopathic knowledge would not pass the standards of the examining committee .49 Four years later, in 1923, Benjam\u00edn L\u00f3pez, graduate from the ELHM, requested the registration of his degree in Yucat\u00e1n. This time the local Sanitary Boa rd asked the the DSP if the latter accepted those titles and received the notification that only titles from the National University or from state governments could be registered .50 Even in the Federal District where the DSP ruled professional medical pract ice, ELHM graduates found ways to overcome sanitary regulations, register their degrees, and have their certificates accepted by local civilian courts. After the DSP re fused to acknowledge ELHM degrees as legal in November 1922, they started to request loc al municipal governments in the Federal District to accept their death certificates. Sometimes these petitions included other practitioners who belonged to homeopathic medical societies but whose training background is difficult to track. Municipal governm ents complied with or rejected homeopaths ' petitions based on other local administration decisions, opinions of high federal functionaries, legal arguments, or political relationships. In November, 1923, the municipality of Coyoac\u00e1n agreed to receive ELHM graduates' death certificates because Mexico City's government had already done it and the secretary of public education had declared that the studies at the ELHM were as good as those of other medical schools .51 Using the same evidence, the lawyer of the m unicipality of Guadalupe Hidalgo denied the petition in June, 1924, on the basis that civil judges could only 49 See David Sowell, \"Quacks and Doctors: The Construction of Biomedical Authority in Mexico,\" Juniata Voices 5 (2005): 22 -23. 50 See correspondence between the Sanitary Board of Yucat\u00e1n and the DSP of May 24, 1923, and June 12, 1923, in the A HSS, SP, EM, 4, 36. 51 Correspondence from the Municipality of Coyoac\u00e1n to the Free School of Homeopathy of November 13, 1923, in the A HELHM 242 accept official degrees and that regardless of the opinions of UNM's Dean about the ELHM, his document stated that the National University did not certif y professional degrees from free schools .52 The following year, the municipality of San \u00c1ngel registered degrees of homeopaths who belonged to the Union of Homeopathic Physicians Graduated from Free Schools and ordered local civilian courts to accept these homeopaths' dea th certificates on the basis of the relationship between the homeopaths' union, the CROM, and the Assembly of Muni cipalities of the Federal District .53 Contesting the sanitary dictatorship was fragmented, leading to internal conflicts in the community of homeopaths who graduated in free schools. This division decreased the effect of their political actions. For instan ce, most homeopaths who obtained authorization to issue death certificates in the municipality of San \u00c1ngel were not in Moheno's original request to and later lawsuit against the DSP. While most of them were ELHM graduates, there were some who had graduate d elsewhere (see chapter 6 for a discussion of other free schools offering medical training in Mexico City and Puebla in the 1920s) and who did not belong to the union. The latter complained with the municipality, submitting a list of actual affiliates who should be the ones authorized to issue death certificates. The lack of a corporate structure that unified demands from the diverse array of graduates from different free schools and the DSP's monolithic criterion regarding degrees from free schools made c ontesting the sanitary dictatorship difficult. Rather, the lack of coherent state policies regarding professional training at the federal, state, and local level, and regulation of medical training and practice made contesting the sanitary dictatorship partially effective. 52 Correspondence from the municipal governor to Guadalupe Arellano, J. Hern\u00e1ndez Osorio, and other petitioners, dated on, June 12, 1924, in the A HELHM . 53 For Tacubaya see AHCM, AGDF, T , M, 10, 40 . For San Angel see AHCM, M, SA, A, 3, 365 . 243 Also part of this effectiveness was the organization of corporate bodies that grouped a larger contingent first of homeopaths who had graduated in free schools and eventually from a larger community of homeopathy supporters (see chapter 6). Sanitary authorities' attitude against ELHM graduates motivated a new form of organization amongst the latter, evidenced in the case of the municipality of San Angel. The union that obtained the support of the municipality of San \u00c1ngel had just been re cently created on July 10, 1924 .54 Yet homeopaths had been organizing into unions since 1919, when they created the Union of Homeopathic Physicians of the Federal District. This Union helped create the CROM in 1918 and continued as a member of this confeder ation until 1928, when the confederation dissociated. But when exscinded members of the CROM created the new Federation of Worker Unions of the Federal District in February 1929, the homeopaths' union joined in .55 Homeopathic unions and their relationship w ith worker's organization in Mexico City eventually would lead them to push for the regulation that made the ELHM a legal institution in 1929, but before this happened they continued pushing against the DSP's dictatorial measures. The Union of Homeopathic Physicians of the Federal District starkly opposed issuing the sanitary code in 1926. Facundo Hidalgo, the union's leader, addressed President Plutarco El\u00edas Calles on February 27, 1926, to request a meeting to discuss the new sani tary code, but the president did not agree. Instead, he requested his particular secretary, Fernando Torreblanca, to 54 See \"Amparo en contra del Presidente de la rep\u00fablica y jefe del DSP por SJ, 41, 10, pp. 3 -16. 55 For the unions that were part of the Regional Confederation of Mexican Workers during its first years see Davis, Urban Leviathan : Mexico City in the Twentieth Century 48.

To see how corporatist politics worked in Mexico City in the 1920s see John Lear, Workers, Neighbors, and Citizens: the Revolution in Mexico City (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2001). 244 attend homeopaths' requests .56 Homeopaths had a personal connection with Fernando Torreblanca since one of his family members, Edmundo Torre blanca (probably his brother or an uncle), was a homeopath too. Edmundo Torreblanca, who had graduated from the ENH in 1896, had a talk with Fernando about Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez Osorio, the ELHM graduate who would represent homeopaths in this negotiation, before Fernando met with Jos\u00e9 on March 4 .57 Whether Edmundo supported Hern\u00e1ndez Osorio or not is uncertain, for while homeopaths shared the same medical doctrine and were associated with the same professional societies, graduates from the ENMH had doctrinarian and institutional differences that set them apart from ELHM's graduates. It is probable that homeopaths perceived that Edmundo's was a positive intervention, for Facundo Hidalgo thanked the particular secretary for his \"attentions to and efficacy in this matter\".58 But President Calles already knew about the situation of graduates of the ELHM. It was him who agreed with Bernardo Gastelum not to grant their titles legal status after they won the lawsuit against the DSP in 1925. After discussing the ideas propose d by Jose Hern\u00e1ndez Osorio with President Calles, Fernando Torreblanca sent a note to Facundo Hidalgo, saying that the president recommended him to raise his demands directly to the head of the DSP .59 Despite their political connection, or probably because of it, homeopaths neither discussed the new sanitary code with sanitary authorities nor prevented the DSP from issuing it. On June 23, after the code was issued, Hidalgo addressed President Calles requesting him to prevent the enforcement of the new sanit ary code. ELHM graduates explained that the new sanitary code had been elaborated by allopaths who had a year -long dispute with homeopaths and who were using 56 Telegram from Facundo Hidalgo, secretary of the Union of Homeopathic Physicians, and President Plutarco Elias Calle s, February 1926.

But once again El\u00edas Calles turned the request to a differe nt office, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, to attend homeopaths' accusation against the DSP.60 The turbulent years of 1928 and 1929 also impacted the mobilization of homeopaths' resistance. As I analyzed in chapter 4, President Calles reinstalled the ENMH in March 1928. Perhaps as a result of this new support to homeopathy and UNM's mobilization to obtain its autonomy, ELHM graduates felt the opportunity had come to obtain the legalization of their school. But the institutional leaders had not changed and their responses were identical to four years earlier . Homeopaths used their relationship with the Federation of Worker Unions of the Federal District to address their labor problems with the UNM and the DSP in 1928. In the first days of July, the federatio n spoke on behalf of homeopaths to the UNM. It requested the validation of ELHM's degrees if after an evaluation by educational authorities these degrees proved to warrant scientific proficiency. One month later, on August 27, 1928, the federation addresse d the DSP, requesting the cessation of \"hostile acts\" and high fines carried out by sanitary authorities against homeopaths, at least while educational authorities responded if they would validate ELHM degrees .61 But no matter what the political situation w as, the DSP's position remained determined to prevent the registration of degrees from free schools. The legal consultant of the sanitary department replied in the same terms as the department had answered homeopaths' lawsuit in 1924. There was no hostilit y against homeopaths on the DSP's side, he said, the department only watched over people's safety by fining those practitioners who did not 60 Telegram from Facundo Hidalgo to President Plutarco El\u00edas Calles, June 23, 1926.

For him, medical practice was not banned by the sanitary code or the sanitary dep artment .62 With no response from the university and with the sanitary authorities' dictatorial position, homeopaths needed to wait until a new presidential term came in and the presidential cabinet changed. In 1929, when President Emilio Portes Gil stepped in, homeopaths initiated a new series of petitions that had a key influence to include article 37 of UNAM's new Organic Law, the one that gave the President and the SEP \u2014 but not UNAM \u2014 the authority to regulate free schools. The exchange of correspondenc e initiated just one month after Portes Gil became President .63 On March 11, Gabriel S\u00faarez, an ELHM graduate and member of the recently created Mexican Homeopathic League [ Liga Homeop\u00e1tica Mexicana ], a professional society that grouped ELHM graduates, noti fied the President about DSP's \"hostilities\" against \"200 homeopaths\" .64 As he had previously done, Portes Gil replied that they should meet with Ezequiel Padilla, the new Minister of the SEP, but this time he also notified ELHM graduates that he had instru cted Aquilino Villanueva, the new DSP head, requesting, as former presidents never did before, that 62 Correspondence from A.

See telegrams of January 22 and 30, and February 16, 1929 in AHELHM, Documents Obreg\u00f3n -Calles. 64 Apparently the initiative came from a recently created group that gathered around 200 ELHM graduates, Liga Homeop\u00e1tica Mexicana .

They reported the results of this meeting on a letter to President Portes Gil, on April 15, 1929, AHELHM, Docum ents Obreg\u00f3n -Calles. 248 Throughout the following two months, President Portes Gil received a wave of requests that sought a solution to their case. On April 18, R. Trevi\u00f1o D\u00edaz, secretary of the Union of Homeopathic Physicians denounced DSP procedures and requested the president's intervention with the DSP and the SEP's acknowledgment of the legality of ELHM medical degrees .70 A week later, Alfredo Zendejas, a ELHM graduate, complained that he was \"deprived from his professional rights just because he had studied at the [ELHM]\" and requested that the SEP revalidate his degree \"through an accreditation exam [ ex\u00e1men de eficiencia ], just as foreign physicians who came to [practice medicine to] the country did.\"71 A week later Manuel D. Rodr\u00edguez, Fernando E. Alva, and Jos\u00e9 D. Z\u00e1rate, all ELHM graduates, made a specific request. In representation of their \"comrades\", they requested tha t their degrees were registered with the DSP.72 In all these cases, Portes Gil resubmitted ELHM graduates' petitions to Ezequiel Padilla, who turned the case to either the SEP's lawyer, as with the union, or to the UNM's Dean, as with Zendejas, Rodr\u00edguez, A lva, and Z\u00e1rate . In the last petition, Portes Gil specifically required Padilla to \"do a study about the case, procuring as possible to help the interested ones in avoiding the difficulties they have been resisting to.\"73 ELHM graduates' active resistance had a perfect political timing.

When the League received news that authorities from the DSP, the UNM and the latter's School of Medicine would celebrate a meeting in mid -May, Su\u00e1rez, Mazari, and Rodr\u00edguez del Solar requested to participate, as representatives of the ELHM, with \"their opinion and their vote\" and both the President and the SEP's Minister agreed .74 Given the conflicts that the UNM was going through during these months to obtain its autonomy from the federal government, it is unlikely that such meetings took place .75 Furthe rmore, after the federal government granted the autonomy to the NUM in the first days of June, Mazari, Su\u00e1rez, and Rodr\u00edguez del Solar addressed the Portes Gil to \"include in the upcoming University Law the needed dispositions to acknowledge the status of Free Schools and to revalidate their degrees by the National University.\"76 They concluded their telegram acknowledging that they \"trust[ed] [in the] right criterion [of the] Prime such petition [which] was indispensable [for the] life of free schools and [the] preservation [of the] learned principle [of] free education included in [the] Constitution .\"77 As I analyzed in chapter 4, Portes Gil gave free schools an opportunity to be reg ulated independently from UNAM \u2014 though not from the federal government \u2014 in the new Organic Law of UNAM in 1929.

Portes Gil government used free schools, particularly the Free School of Homeopathy and the Free School of Law , as scapegoats that outweighed the political power that the university had in the Mexican society. Yet perhaps Portes Gil wouldn't have used the Free School of Homeopathy had its graduates not organized into a professional group that raised their voices a gainst the marginalizing regulations of the UNM and the DSP. ELHM graduates' active resistance reached its objective in the late 1920. The government issued ad hoc legislations that turned the ELHM into a legal institution and consequence, the DSP had no c hoice but to register its medical degrees. The majority of ELHM medical degrees granted during the 1920s were registered as a consequence of this process. But just as with the sanitary dictatorship, the resistance of graduates from free schools had also it s limits. As I will explore in the next chapter, sanitary authorities learned from the experience with ELHM graduates and enforced their policies to avoid the registration of graduates from other free schools of medicine in the early 1930s. Conclusions What is the meaning of homeopathic resistance? In other words, what does this resistance tell us about the social organization of the Mexican medical profession in the 1920s? Furthermore, what does it reveal about the relationship between the Mexican state a nd the Mexican medical profession? Homeopaths contested sanitary measures to control and regulate the medical profession since their arrival to Mexico City in the mid -19th century. Yet while homeopaths' efforts to resist authoritarian measures in the late 19th and early 20th century were similar in the sense that they confronted similar actors, i.e. sanitary authorities and faculty of the local School of Medicine, the polit ical situation of these institutions radically changed in the 20th century, leading to a completely new way to organize resistance. 251 During the 19th century, h omeopaths went from being foreign doctors who enjoyed the support of the ruling elite to both nat ional medical entrepreneurs and practitioners, who provided therapeutic products and services, and national academic physicians, who were trained at state - sponsored medical schools, both allopathic and homeopathic. Such positions placed homeopaths at odds with both the local sanitary regulation and academic medical faculty. Consequently, their resistance was limited to find ways through which they complied with regulation and continue their practice. Even the increasing government intervention during the Porfiriato gave homeopaths a place, whether by giving them the opportunity to be incorporated into the medical profession through studying at the ENMH or by allowing their private practice to those who lacked professional studies. The only, yet meaningful, d ifference was that practitioners wouldn't be authorized to participate of government life as professional experts. After the revolution, the institutions that trained academic physicians and regulated their professional practice became central in the new government structures. New governments, particularly in the second half of the 1910s, believed that it was necessary to create a coherent and unified government structure. This ideology permeated the medical profession and consequently they used their posi tion within the ENM and the DSP to set the standards on what a professional medical practitioner should fulfill to be incorporated into the modern medical institutions of the new revolutionary Mexican state. But this ideology and the measures that resulted from it aimed to impose from the top a unique view of what the medical profession should be, a single medical school in Mexico City, a single medical curriculum, one single kind of medical degree, and one single type of medical practitioner in the medical registry. Homeopaths' resistance evidences the multiple layers of limitations of this unifying process in the 1920s. The different levels of government played a key role. If federal offices such 252 as the DSP and the SEP coordinated their efforts to perpetu ate the distinction between public and private institutions, preventing graduates from the latter from participating in any government activity, local offices within the Federal District, such as civilian registries and local municipalities, not always ali gned with federal policies. Perhaps being aware of the lack of medical practitioners in their particular jurisdictions and certainly as a consequence of union alliances, these local governments sometimes accepted death certificates issued by ELHM graduates or authorized their practice. This situation was extended at the federal level. As a consequence of state government's autonomy granted by the Constitution of 1917, each state was free to regulate professional practice on its own. While some states used t he ideology that federal institutions were imposing in the Federal District, other, such as Hidalgo and Morelos, regulated in favor of ELHM graduates. These inconsistencies motivated the mobilization of DSP personnel and resources to the countryside in ord er to police medical practice (see chapter 4). In the Federal District, the UNM's silence regarding free schools in general and the ELHM in particular contributed to complicate the conflict between ELHM graduates and DSP authorities. Vasconcelos supported the incorporation of the ENMH to the UNM in the early 1920s, but while acknowledging the ELHM's pedagogic academic plan and facilities, he never offered any funding or legal regulation. Vasconcelos' acknowledgment to the ELHM mimicked the contradictions b etween the Constitution and the government structure. While the original Constitution signed in 1917 authorized the foundation of free schools, the SEP and the UNM neither acknowledged their existence nor regulated their training during the 1920s. Conseque ntly, ELHM degrees did not entitle their holders to participate in the government structure. Homeopaths and other medical practitioners graduated from free medical schools were 253 marginalized from the institutions that the medical profession was building in conjunction with the revolutionary state. But the relationship between the medical profession and the Mexican state suffered a rupture by the end of the 1920s. This rupture evidences the limits the political power of DSP's and UNM's authorities. The close association of the medical profession to the state made the former susceptible to the changing policies of the latter. When differences between them arose, Mexican governments subsumed the project for unification of the medical profession in favor of its own political aims, which in terms of the medical profession meant a redistribution of political power. Homeopaths were there as a professional and political group that counterweighted the political power of the UNM. It is not that ELHM graduates competed in terms of state resources with the rest of the medical profession. Homeopaths were marginal in terms of their population, of the number of patients they treated, and of the scale of their two medical schools. Rather ELHM graduates were politically active , and their connections with unions, and leaders of the revolution such as Vasconcelos and Carrillo Puerto, motivated them to be persistent in their demands to the federal government. Consequently, when it needed to balance the increasing political power o f the university and its graduates, the federal government supported ho meopaths, not because it sided with their particular therapeutic approach, but because they represented a political group that actively supported free schools and contested the UNM's au thority. Homeopaths' resistance was not effective against DSP's regulations. Homeopaths were not able to convince sanitary authorities to stop either issuing reforms to the sanitary code in 1926, which made controlling measures of medical practice even mo re rigorous, or enforcing such reforms, except from short periods of time. Rather, they convinced the federal government 254 and its minister of education to regularize the situation of their school. In other words, once the government demolished the \"wall\" th at blocked the regulation of the ELHM, its graduates were able to escape from the DSP's \"sword\". But just for a brief period of time. As the data from the medical registry evidence (see chapter 4), the DSP continued blocking the registry to ELHM graduates during the 1930s and reforming sections of the sanitary code that aimed to forbid homeopathic practices. As I will show in the next chapter graduates from free schools, including homeopaths, continued resisting with limited success the sanitary dictatorshi p, evidencing that just as the sanitary dictatorship, their resistance had also its limits. 255 Chapter 6 . The Limits of Resistance: Medical Degrees, Medical Advertising, and the New Sanitary Code, 1930 -34 In 1935, the Union of Medical Docto rs of the Federal District [ Sindicato de M\u00e9dicos Cirujanos del Distrito Federal ] published a special issue to criticize the political activity of homeopaths and their institutions. In one of its internal pages, an image displayed in the background depicted a battle field where cannons and airplanes combated each other in an incarnate fight. An ambulance displaying the sign \"sugar\" drove through the battle field to assist those in need. In the first plane of the image, a high -rank officer handed a rif fle to a lower -rank soldier. The sarcastic captions read \"In the battle field. Injured soldiers must be treated with homeopathic sugar; in the end canyons shoot nothing more than bonbons, sugar candies and peanuts.\" The picture was an ac erbic critique to h omeopathic medicines. Regular doctors had mocked homeopathic globules for lacking any real therapeutic substance since the last quarter of the 19th century, but in the context of 1935 this picture could be read as a metaphor of what was occurring in the pr ofessional body politic.1 Graduates from the Free School of Homeopathic Medicine had been struggling since the early 1920s to have their medical school acknowledged as a regular institution. When they achieved such recognition in 1930, graduates from othe r free schools followed the path the ELHM had created to obtain their official recognition. But sanitary authorities, who believed that people trained at free schools lacked the appropriate medical training, reinforced their campaign to contain the prolife ration of what they called c harlatans with a medical degree . Sanitary authorities did not introduce any new regulation; rather they enforced regulations on medical practice and medical advertising of the sanitary code of 1926. Their campaign was successful and homeopaths could only seldom resist the DSP's sanitary dictatorship through 1934. In this 1 \"N\u00famero especial dedicado a las manifestaciones charlatanesco -homeop\u00e1ticas,\" 10. 256 sense, the cartoon was a reflection of the effectiveness of sanitary policies to regulate medical practice in the first half of the 1930s. It is also a reflectio n of the useless efforts of homeopaths and other free -schools graduates to resist the DSP's dictatorial measures. In this chapter, I analyze the failed efforts of graduates from other free schools to resist the marginalization of medical practice by the sanitary code of 1926. I argue in the first section that the DSP enforced its sanitary police and turned into a regu lator of professional medical training as a result of the ELHM's political ability to obtain its recognition as an official medical school. The shifting policies of the Maximato altogether with the conflicts between the state and the university resulted in new regulations that the SEP used to shy away from its responsibility to regulate free schools and the DSP used to ban graduates from the medical registry. In the absence of an agreement between the SEP and the DSP regarding adequate medical training, the latter became and office that specifically surveyed free schools to pro ve they lacked official credentials to grant medical degrees. In the second section, I explore how the DSP changed its approach to police medical advertising from trying to convince pr actitioners to comply with the sanitary code to generating legal procedures to have effective cases in court and enforce practitioners to both pay fines and obey the sanitary code. Finally, I analyze the arguments that homeopaths used to try to convince Pr esident Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez and sanitary authorities to incorporate their demands in a new version o f the sanitary code in 1934. The se letters highlighted the conflict between sanitary authorities and ENM graduates, or \"allopaths\", as they called them, a nd homeopaths in terms of class struggle, professional competition, and the suitability of homeopathy as a scientific medicine for the working class. They used a social democratic rhetoric to convince the revolutionary government that supporting homeopathy aligned with the purposes and aims of the revolution. I conclude by reflecting on the enforcement 257 of the sanitary dictatorship and the limits of resistance to change the sanitary policies in this period. Regulating Professional Medical Training: The Depa rtment of Public Health Contains the Proliferation of Free Medical Schools Taking advantage of a new presidential succession \u2014 President Emilio Portes Gil left office in February 1920 and Pascual Ortiz Rubio stepped in \u2014 and the consequent restructuration of ministries, several medical organizations addressed the new heads of the DSP and the SEP to stop the registry of homeopaths in 1930. The National Academy of Medicine, the Mexican Medical Association, the Federation of Medical Unions of Mexico, and the U nion of Medical Doctors of the Federal District asked President Ortiz Rubio to reconsider the decree issued by the former president and that had turned the ELHM into a legal medical school in late January 1930. Using the public good as basis for their argu ments, these professional societies and groups demanded that authorities did not implement the decree, or at least that the SEP interrupted the validation of ELHM's titles while the president and educational authorities considered what these medical organi zations demanded .2 President Portes Gil corresponded with the SEP and the DSP and finally agreed to the request of these professional organizations, asking the SEP to stop validating titles until the DSP gave its opinion about the situation .3 These 2 Correspondence from the National Academy of Medicine, Mexican Medical Association, Federation of Unions, and Union of the Federal District, to the head of the DSP, Rafael Silva, February 26, 1930 , AHSS, SP, SJ, 7, 2. 3 On February 27, 1930, the President requested the head of the SEP a report about the academic curricula to the ministry of public education. On March 3, 1930, the latter replied that it was necessary to have an accurate preparatory education before entering the medical school, and since the decree that authorized the FSH did not describe accurately the requisites to enroll in the medical school, the SEP could not validate its titles issued before 1930. He also suggested that the decree was modified so it included the need to have preparatory studies before enrolling to the FSH. On March 14, 1930, President Ortiz Rubio addressed Rafael Silva, head of the DSP, to ask him for counseling to improve the decree that authorized the FSH; AHSS, SP, SJ, 7, 2. See also \"ACUERDO del Presidente\" in AHSS, S P, SJ, 28, 3, and \"Asuntos que se llevan al acuerdo del C. Presidente de Rep\u00fablica de febrero de AHSS, SP, SJ, 7, 2. 258 negoti ations show that the SEP was more interested in regulating requisites to enroll in professional education than the quality of professional medical training, the latter being the interest of sanitary authorities. Furthermore, while both ministers agreed on the ELHM's deficient academic curriculum and in consequence intended to modify the decree, the DSP recognized that the SEP should not stop validating ELHM degrees that it had already received because in the sanitary department's experience that would lead to lawsuits that homeopaths could win, constituting a precedent that would impose limits on a later modification of the original decree. In the end, the DSP left all regulatory activity of medical education within free schools to the SEP .4 Despite the abrupt reduction in the registration rate of ELHM -issued medical degrees a couple of months after President Portes Gil authorized it (see Chapter 4), and despite the demands of the aforementioned medical organizations and sanitary authorities themselves, which requested that the SEP stop validating these degrees, the SEP and the DSP followed what the decree dictated a couple of years after 1930, but not for much longer. The new legislation that provided venues to turn free schools into legal i nstitutions in 1929 had a positive impact in free schools in Mexico City, particularly the ELHM and the Free School of Law, but the changing politics during the Maximato made their legal status weak. The SEP recognized the ELHM as a legal medical school, v alidated its degrees, and the DSP registered the latter in 1930. The ELHM's exemplary resistance against the DSP and struggle to be acknowledged as a legal institution during the 1920s worked as a model that other graduates from free schools both in the ca pital and in other states followed, in order to achieve the regularization of their own schools. But with a new legislation in 1933 that banned the SEP's responsibility to authorize free schools and validate their degrees, the SEP could not respond to 4 See \"MEMORANDUM relativo a la reglamentaci\u00f3n de las escuelas libres\" and following documents in AHSS, SP, SJ, 7, 2. 259 free schools' demands in the Federal District, leaving them in the same legal status as they were before 1930. The case in other states was different. The SEP had no jurisdiction on the regulation of professional training beyond the Federal District and conseq uently the decree that made free schools legal had no impact in the regulation of free schools in other parts of the nation. Facing the SEP's passive role in preventing the regularization of free medical schools and the growth of other free schools in the rest of the country, the DSP assumed the responsibility of policing medical training and banned, with very rare exceptions, the registration of medical degrees from free schools, both in the Federal District and other states, for the rest of the decade. Th ese actions made the DSP the principal agent that regulated medical training in free schools after 1929, limiting the resistance of doctors graduated from these schools during the 1930s. The case of the Free School of Obstetrics and Nursing in Mexico City [Escuela Libre de Obstetricia y Enfermer\u00eda , ELOE] offers a window to analyze how the regulatory control of medical training in free schools actually took place on the ground, shifting from the SEP, which was legally entitled to exert such control, to the D SP, whose role was centered on preventing untrained physicians from entering the medical registry. This case also evidences the way the SEP and the DSP interpreted the legislation to simply evade the responsibility to regulate free schools in the former ca se, and ban free schools from the medical registry in the latter case. The ELOE regularized its situation as a free medical school on March 10, 1931 ,5 just one year after the ELHM did. As a regular medical school, the DSP registered its degrees. But on Mar ch 8, 1932, a new decree abolished the one of 1929 and the SEP attempted to withdraw the school's legal recognition. In 1934, Arturo Palmero, head of the school, won a lawsuit initiated in 1933 5 See \"DECRETO por el cual se concede a la Escuela Libre de Obstetricia y Enfermer\u00eda de M\u00e9xico, el reconocimiento los privilegios que refiere Ley Diario ados Unidos Mexicanos, September 20, 2012, <http://www.dof.gob.mx/index.php?year=1931&month=3&day=24>.7 . 260 against the SEP that required the latter to fulfill its admini strative duties regarding the validation of ELOE's degrees. But using UNAM's new Organic Law of 1933, which abolished the regulation that originally had given authority to the President of Mexico and the SEP to regulate free schools in 1929, the SEP appeal ed the resolution to the SCJN in Arturo Palmero's case, arguing that it no longer had the responsibility to validate the academic curricula and degrees of the ELOE. In the appeal's resolution, the court acknowledged that the SEP had no longer the authoriza tion to validate degrees from free schools, but recognized the right to issue medical degrees with the same status as those issued by official professional schools, a right that the ELOE had obtained in 1931. Furthermore, the court acknowledged the need to create a new office that registered degrees issued by free schools .6 The DSP denied the registry to ELOE's degrees using arguments similar to the ones the SEP had elaborated in the lawsuit, apparently learning from the latter the legal basis to prevent the inclusion of free schools' graduates in the registry. Sanitary authorities argued that UNM's Organic Law of 1929 had abolished fraction V of article 157 of the Sanitary Code, the one that ruled under which conditions the DSP could register degrees from f ree schools. If the new Organic Law of 1933 abolished the one of 1929, the sanitary administration had no legal reference that characterized under which circumstances the DSP was authorized to register degrees from free schools. In ELOE's case, the DSP ori ginally continued to register its degrees, even after the decree of 1932. But after the ELOE's conflict with the SEP, the DSP stopped registering the school's degrees. On 1934, the DSP denied the registry to Mar\u00eda Salazar de 6 Lawsuit Arturo Palmero, director of the FSON vs. the DSP, July 20, 1934, in AHSS, SP, SJ, 41, 8, pp. 2-4. Federaci\u00f3n , 5a. September 20, 2012, <http://biblio.juridicas.unam.mx/libros/2/830/23.pdf.>.7 de las Dur\u00e1n, an ELOE graduate, and Ar turo Palmero took the opportunity to sue the sanitary department on behalf of all the school's graduates. He argued that the decree of March 10, 1931, turned the school into an official institution, and consequently it had to be considered as such when the sanitary authorities interpreted the Sanitary Code \u2014 fraction II of article 157 recognized the legality of schools authorized by the federal government. But Palmero lost the case in the court .7 The DSP argued that it could register free schools' medical d egrees that were explicitly validated by the SEP from 1930 to 1933, but after the UNAM's Organic Law of 1933, the SEP had lost its legal attributions and was no longer authorized to validate such degrees, as neither was the DSP to register them. Based on s uch arguments, the DSP continued neglecting the registry of ELOE's titles throughout the 1930s. For instance, in 1937, Arturo Palmero requested the head of the DSP that ELOE's degrees were included in the registry .8 Facing the lack of a clear regulatory f ramework for free medical schools and the shifting role of the SEP in enforcing the regulation of these schools in the early 1930s, the DSP carried out profound investigations to find out if free schools' degrees were granted as a result of proper medical training and not just to provide them a way of living. The DSP also pursued investigations to find out the legal status of particular free schools and hence the legality of their degrees. In this way, the sanitary department rather than the SEP became the government 7 The long case is described in the correspondence exchange between judges, the ministry of public health, legal counselors of the DSP, and in the lawsuits and revisions to it by the SCJN, see AHSS, SP, SJ, 41, 8, pp. 5 -6, 8-9, 14 -17, 21, 23 -31, 32 -37, and 50 -56. A case w here the DSP used similar arguments was the one of Isaac D\u00edaz Espinosa, a graduate of the Free Homeopathic Institute of Mexico. Ha had graduated from this institution in 1920 and sued the DSP on 1934. He lost the case, because the SCJN argued that the DSP was acting constitutionally since it only did what the law entitled to do; in AHSS, SP, SJ, 41, 21. 8 A closer study of the registry needs to be carried out to figure out if Palmero's complaint was a political positioning regarding his ideas about the legality of free medical schools in general and the DSP obligation to acknowledge them as such or if the DSP actually denied the registry to ELOE students who graduated between years 1931 and 1933 -those years when according to the department's arguments ELOE's graduates were regular. Correspondence from Arturo Palmero to the head of the DSP, October 25, 1937 , in AHSS, SP, EM, 14, 4, pp. 2 -4. 262 institution that policed medical training on the ground from 1932 to 1936. The following are some examples. In Mexico City, the Institute of Medical Sciences had been educating physician -surgeons, surgeon -dentists, pharmacists and midwives sinc e 1922. In 1931 under a new name, the then Free Mexican University [ Universidad Libre Mexicana, hereon ULM] tried to achieve the presidential authorization to become an official professional school. Foreseeing a SEP's new authorization to a free school wit h dubious level of medical training, the DSP communicated a series of cases that aimed to demonstrate the careless way in which the school granted degrees to its medical students. According to the report, Antonio Ruiz G\u00f3mez had learned medicine by himself and after paying 500 pesos for a single exam, he obtained the degree of physician - surgeon. Fernando Albisu Calvo validated subjects that he had studied in Zaragoza, Spain and coursed seven classes in the ULM after which he obtained his title. The sanitary department reported similar cases in this school for surgeon -dentists. It also reported that it possessed evidence that the school never requested students any proof of having attended high school before enrolling in the university or issuing a degree. Wit h this evidence in hand, the DSP asked the SEP to form a commission to evaluate the feasibility to deny authorization to this school .9 The DSP ma nifested its intentions and neither the SEP authorized or validated its degrees of medical doctor, dentist, pha rmacist, or midwife, nor did the DSP register these degrees in the first half of the 1930s .10 9 Correspondence from the DSP to the minister of public education, May 19, 1931, in AHSS, SP, SJ, 28, 3. 10 Correspondence from a commission of the ULM integrated by Dr. Antonio Ruiz G\u00f3mez, Dr. Migule Olgu\u00edn S., Dr. Jes\u00fas Corral Gallegos, Dr. Rafael Renegal, and Dr. Rafael Palacios O., to President General L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, September 24, 1935, in AHSS, SP, SJ, 29, 14. 263 The case of the Free School of Medicine of Puebla [ Escuela Libre de Medicina de Puebla of Free School of Homeopathy of Puebla is an example of how the DSP carried out extensive and detailed investigations to find legal arguments to prevent the regularization of free medical schools not only in Mexico City, but in the rest of the country, in the early 1930s. Sources are not consistent when referring t o the origin of this school, or even schools, to its (or their) actual name, and its (or their) particular doctrinarian orientation. Perhaps this lack of consistency , the way sanitary authorities collected information about the school(s), or a little bit o f both made it (them) appear somewhat obscure to the eyes o f sanitary authorities. It is most likely that the ELMP was a single school that granted a single degree of Doctor in homeopathic medicine, surgery, and obstetrics .12 Just as the ELHM, the ELMP had a close connection to the ENMH, since apparently one of the foreign homeopaths who revalidated his degree with the ENMH helped to create this and other independent medical schools in the early 1910s .13 President Venustiano Carranza authorized the ELMP on Ja nuary 4, 1915, four years 11 Or Free School of Homeopathy of Puebla. Sources are not clear about the name of the school. Some lawsuit s indicate that the person who initiated the law suit was a homeopath who had graduated from the Free School of Medicine of Puebla, but other ones did not specified if they were homeopaths had also graduated from this school. Verdicts from the SCJN also in dicate that they did not have clear evidence of the identity of the school. 12 Most of the sources refer to it as the Free School of Medicine of Puebla, even lawsuits of its graduates against the DSP (see following references). Yet other sources that liste d those graduates who sued the DSP referred to the school as the Free School of Homeopathy of Puebla, as in \"La Suprema Corte Niega el Home\u00f3patas\", El Puebla, Domingo 29 de mayo de 1932. Other sources mentioned the existence of both schools, as in the correspondence from Jos\u00e9 M. Mendoza to Deputy Alberto Bremauntz on January 23, 1934, in AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 12, p. 8 -11. Perhaps the confusion arose because this school offered degree s of \"Physician or Doctor in Homeopathic Medicine, Surgery and Obstetrics\", as Rafael Ch\u00e1vez de Alba explained when he sued the DSP, AHSS, SP, SJ, 45, 17, p. 2 -3. In other words, it was a free school of medicine that offered homeopathic degrees. 13 Teofilo Ollivier y Ortiz, a homeopathic physician who had studied at the Instituto Homeop\u00e1tico de Colombia and who had migrated to Mexico in the early 1900s, started to practice homeopathy in Mexico City around 1904, when he established a Homeopathic Office in \"L a Merced\" neighborhood. One year later, together with his brother Juan Ollivier, he opened a homeopathic medical school called the Electro - Homeopathic Institute. A decade later, Juan Ollivier headed the Free School of Medicine of Puebla. See a notarized co py of the decree issued by Venustiano Carranza on January 4, 1915, that acknowledged and 264 after it opened. According to his decree, the school had its \"educational programs [aligned] according to the regulations of the University\", and authorized its head at the time, Juan Ollivier, to \"issue professional degrees that [were] applicable throughout all the national territory.\"14 The school had no apparent regulatory conflict during the 1920s, until the congress of the state of Puebla, following the DSP policies regarding medical practice, approved a law on July 25, 1930 to nullify ELMP -issued medical degrees . Other states, such as Estado de M\u00e9xico, supported the \"relentless campaign [of the Congress of Puebla] against the charlatans who had exploited the ignorance of the clases menesterosas [working class], protecting thems elves under fake professional degrees\" ,15 yet only ELMP graduates, who believed in the legality of their school and consequently of their degrees, mounted an energetic resistance against their government and the DSP. Several ELMP graduates sued the DSP for several reasons from 1929 to 1936, but only two of them won their cases and made it into the medical registry. In general, this outcome was a consequence of several reasons; the specific demands that each ELMP graduate made to the DSP, the lack of a unifo rm criterion with which the SCJN solved each particular case ,16 the officially recognized the ELMP, in AGN, ALR, 011/13, see also corresponendence from Antonio P\u00e9rez Alcocer, head of the DSP Office of Legal Affairs to the Head of the D SP, on December 4, 1936, AHSS, SP, P, S, 14, 5. 14 See a notarized copy of the decree issued by Venustiano Carranza on January 4, 1915, that acknowledged and officially recognized the ELMP, in AGN, ALR, 011/13 15 Correspondence from Abelardo Monta\u00f1o and Eze quiel G.

For ins tance, only Antonio Herrera Bravo out of eleven ELMP graduates who had sued the government of Puebla in 1932 and lost their case requested a revision of his case in the Supreme Court of Justice [SCJN] .17 Herrera Bravo sued the President for issuing the Sanitary Code of 1926 and the DSP for restricting medical practice .18 He argued that his degree was registered in Puebla, Guerrero, and Estado de M\u00e9xico, that he offered his services in the Ministry of War a nd the Navy, and that he was the director of the Hospital General both in Guerrero and Texcoco; yet the DSP forbid him to advertise his services as and include in his prescriptions the inscription that he was a medical doctor with a professional degree. He also offered evidence that other lawsuits had ela+libre+de+m edicina+de+puebla>.7 ; \"Validez de los registro <http://www.jurisconsulta.mx/index.php/JurisprudenciaSCJN/ViewTesis? iD=4276&searchQuery=Escuel a+libre>.7 17 According to a newspaper of Mexico City and a local newspaper of Puebla, the SCJN had a verdict against Ernesto Camarillo, Jos\u00e9 Campos, Cruz C\u00e1zares, Francisco Ortiz, Librado Tequitzi, Antonio Herrera Bravo and Arnulf o Cort\u00e9s, all of them graduates from the \"Free School of Homeopathy\". The newspaper foresought a similar verdict other cases; \"La Suprema Niega el El de 1932. The Supreme Court's verdict also denied the legality of titles from Jos\u00e9 M. Mendoza, Oscar Filem\u00f3n Gonz\u00e1lez, . 18 See Antonio Herrera Bravo's lawsuit of November 14, 1933, in AHSS, SP, S J, 38, 12, p. 3. 266 favored other ELMP's graduates .19 As ELHM graduates, Herrera claimed that the ELMP was a legal medical school when he received his medical degree and that consequently the application of the sanitary code as wa s against the Constitution , which granted him the free practice of medicine. But the SCJN did not find evidence that the DSP forbid his practice and offer a verdict that favored the DSP .20 Juan Guerrero got a similar verdict, in this case because the DSP pu rsued an intensive search of a document where, according to Guerrero ,21 former President Venustiano Carranza authorized the ELMP. The DSP did not find such document and decided that because the \"department did not have the absolute certainty of the legality of [Guerrero's] degree, [...] the registry of such document in the [sanitary] office did not proceed.\"22 The successful case of Rafael Ch\u00e1vez de Alva highlights the limitation of resistance against the regulatory role of the DSP during the early 1930s. Ch\u00e1 vez de Alva lost his first lawsuit against the DSP in 1931. The sanitary department argued that Carranza's decree was not published in El Constitutcionalista , official journal of the Revolutionary Government; [that] no minister ratified the decree; [that] the Ministry of War could not find in its archives any proof that Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz Infante informed in a document issued in January 1915 President Carranza's desires to officially recognize the school; [that] public notary Callejo did not certify that Mu\u00f1oz was the one who signed the document that informed about the school [offi cial] recognition ;23 19 These graduates were Guillermo Rodr\u00edguez Solar, Librado Toquiantzi, Sebasti\u00e1n Bucio, and Vicente D. Anaya. The exact verdict of the SCJN is not stated in the source. Guillermo Rodr\u00edguez del Solar was a graduate from the ELHM who obt ained the registry in 1930 as a consequence of the degree that regularized the ELHM and not as a consequence of a lawsuit. It is unlikely that the final result of the legal processes of the other graduates benefited, since they were not registered by the D SP. 20 See correspondence from Manuel Gea Gonz\u00e1lez, head of the DSP, to the Judge of the 6th District of the Federal District on November 17, 1933; and Veredict to the SCJM of November 18, 1933, in AHSS, SP, SJ, 38, 12, pp. 21 Several ELMP graduates pointed out to sanitary authorities the existence of this document. Both Antonio Herrera Bravo and Juan Guerrero indicated that such document was issued on January 4, 1915. As I pointed out in a previous note, this statement was accurate. Other graduates, such as Dr. Jos\u00e9 de Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez Galindo said that the document was issued on Dec 20, 1914, see AGN, POR, 1932 24/1959. 22 See certificate of Manuel Gea Gonz\u00e1lez on November 27, 1934, in AHSS, SP, SJ, 41, 12, pp. 8 -9. 23 Lawsuit of Rafael Ch\u00e1vez de Alba against the DSP on July 8, 1935, in AHSS, SP, SJ, 45, 17, pp. 2 -3. 267 and others that highlighted Carranza's limited attributions to regulate education beyond the Federal District and the inconsistencies in the public administration th at gave the DSP authority over judicial decisions on administrative matters .24 Like Herrera Bravo's case, Ch\u00e1vez de Alba used former verdicts that favored ELMP graduates and the same constitutional articles that the DSP violated in the revision of his case. But in contrast to Herrera Bravo's case, Ch\u00e1vez de Alba specifically demanded the DSP decision to deny him the registry, arguing that degrees issued by the ELMP were as legal as those issued by other states (article 121 of the Constitution ). In this case the SCJN's verdict benefited Ch\u00e1vez de Alba, not because his argument was better formulated in legal terms than Herrera Bravo's, but because the DSP used the sanitary code of 1926 instead of the current one (1934) to deny Ch\u00e1vez de Alba de registry .25 A fai lure in the DSP's legal procedure helped Rafael Ch\u00e1vez de Alba to make it into the medical registry. In the 1930s, the DSP only registered ELMP degrees that the SCJN explicitly obliged it to register; in this case, only two, the degrees of Rafael Ch\u00e1vez de Alba and Rafael M\u00e1rquez. ELMP graduates could not get the DSP to acknowledge the legality of their school and consequently register their degrees during the first half of the 1930s, unless a verdict from the SCJN explicitly requested the government offic e to do it. Consequently, they followed the same venue that their professional peers from the ELHM had pursued in the late 1920s, mainly the mobilization of its graduates to directly demand President Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez's intervention. In contrast to the case of the ELHM, in 1932 there already was a decree that regulated the legalization of free professional schools and this decree required that free medical schools had the same academic curriculum as the ENM, among other requirements such as hygienic and 24 Besides the lawsuit see also correspondence from Antonio P\u00e9rez Alcocer to the head of the DSP on December 4, 1936, in AHSS, SP, P, S, 14, 5. 25 See revision of the lawsuit of Rafael Ch\u00e1vez Alva a gainst the DSP on November 14, 1935, in AHSS, SP, SJ, 45, 17, pp. 17 -8. 268 adequate facilities and a record of middle and high -school studies. Perhaps these requirements prevented the ELMP from undertaking this venue to legalize the situation of its graduates. Yet if it had gone through it, there might have been other arguments, such as the ones ELHM graduates faced, where medical degrees issued since the creation of the school until its legalization would have been still considered irregular by DSP authorities. ELMP graduates, particularly those living in Durango, a state in no rthern Mexico, and affiliated to the Society of Homeopathic Physicians from Durango [ Sociedad de M\u00e9dicos Home\u00f3patas Durangue\u00f1os ]26 wanted to overcome this regulatory inconsistency by addressing the President. Complaints initiated just after President Rodr\u00edg uez stepped in office in 1932 .27 Jose M. Me ndoza requested the president's intervention in the case of Puebla because \"authorities were being hostile\" against \"homeopathic physicians\".28 Six months later Jos\u00e9 G. Rico and Jos\u00e9 Favela asked the president to in tervene and ask the DSP to register their medical degrees, \"saving them the costs of a lawsuit that they would anyway win\" .29 The situation was particularly serious since sanitary agents enforced the sanitary code of 1926 and fined practitioners who did not complied with its policies (a situation that I will analyze below). The society complained that the DSP's sanitary agents only wanted that \"allopaths enjoyed the warrants given in the Constitution \" and that the state government of Puebla did not acknowled ge 26 In the first half of the 1930s, this society was formed by Dr. Miguel A. Reyes (President), Dr. Jos\u00e9 Favela (Secretary), Dr. Rafael Chaparro V\u00e9rtiz (Treasurer), Dr. J. Guadalupe Rico (1st Vocal), Dr. Roberto C. Collazo (2nd vocal), Dr. Pascual Hern\u00e1ndez ( 3rd vocal), all allegedly graduates from the ELMP. The letterhead included the legend Facultad Homeop\u00e1tica Telegram exchange between F.

Rico and Dr. Jos\u00e9 Favela, from Santiago Papasquiaro, Durango, and the head of the DSP, on January 17 and 18, 1933, regulations issued by the federal congress and the executive power .30 Moreover, they addressed the local governor of Coahuila, a neighbor state, describing how Romeo de la Fuente, who should not hold the degree of DOCTOR, showing by his attitude that he studied in some University of Congo, and using his official position as head of the City of Torre\u00f3n[, Coahuila]'s County Sanitary Department, continues harassing our partner, Dr. Roberto Carrizales Collazo [...], in the most wicked way and evidencing his phobia, [...] just for simply providing service to someone who requested his professional services to treat a physical malady.31 These requests and complain ts became m ore urgent at the turn of 1933, when ELMP graduates received a notice that a reform to the sanitary code of 1926 was on its way. I will analyze the reactions to such threatening news for the medical practice of graduates from free schools in the last secti on of this chapter. In the context of the ELMP's conflict, the Society from Durango mobilized other organizations, both civilian and homeopathic, to find a solution to the legal situation of degrees issued by the ELMP . Unfortunately for their purposes, the Society's rhetoric about a \"revolutionary\" government which fought against the \"monopoly\" and in favor of the \"health and wellbeing of the society\" did not work.32 The president did not address their concerns in person .33 As it had happened in previous year s, particularly during El\u00edas Calles' 30 Document summarizing the letter from Dr. Miguel A. Reyes and Dr. Jos\u00e9 Favela to President Abelardo L. Miguel A. Reyes and Profa. H. D\u00edaz de Le\u00f3n to Nazario S.

See Summary for the President from the letter written by Manlio Martin Espinosa, Presdient of the Center, on Dec 12, 1933; letter from the Society of Homeopathic Physicians from Durango to the Head of the DSP Office of Legal Affairs on Feb 30, 1934; letter from the same society to President Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez on April 25, 1934; and letter from the same society to President Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez on June 33 The President did meet with them once, but even if President Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez promised to turn the case to his minister of the interior, former president Emilio Porte Gil, and even if homeopaths had alliances with Masonic groups to which President Rodr\u00edguez belonged and pay allegiance to, he eventually sent the case to the DSP. See letter from the Society of Homeopathic Physicians from Durango 270 term, President Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez asked the DSP to find a solution to ELMP graduates complaints. In 1936, Antonio P\u00e9rez Alcocer, head of the DSP Office of Legal Affairs acknowledged that despite the higher proporti on of verdicts of the SCJN in favor of ELMP graduates vs. those in favor of the sanitary department, the [DSP] continued denying the registry of degrees [of ELMP graduates who won their lawsuit], particularly since the school and the lawsuits in the court negotiated an uncountable quantity of degrees that the school issued even while being closed, but making them appear as if they had been issued before the closure.34 P\u00e9rez Alcocer's statement could not express in a more open and clearer way the role that the DSP played as the regulator of medical training in Mexico in the early 1930s and how this role limited the possibilities of resistance of graduates from free schools. Under the rule of a Ministry of Public Education whose original policy opened the ga tes to the regularization of medical training in free schools, the DSP became stricter in the application of the sanitary code in matters of professional practice. But during the changing policies and regulations of the Maximato , the SEP soon stop ped sidin g with free schools and even provided with the legal foundations to prevent their medical degrees from being registered with the DSP. While this worked in some instances, the legal arguments that the DSP used where useless in cases such as the ELMP's, wher e the legality of the school was more likely and the majority of SCJN's verdicts sided the ELMP rather than the DSP. Yet the DSP's political and institutional power was imposed over other foundational state institutions such as the SCJN, showing that right of a healthy society \u2014 to President Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez on June correspondence from Antonio P\u00e9rez Alcocer to the head of the DSP on December 4, 1936, in AHSS, SP, P, S, 14, 5. 271 which in the case of the medical practice, sanitary authorities understood as the provisio n of adequately trained doctors \u2014 was a value that stood over the Constitution itself in the 1930s. Restricting Medical Advertising: The Depa rtment of Public Health Enforces the Sanitary Police against Irregular Healers The DPS's efforts to control the proliferation of free medical schools all over the nation were closely related to the policing of medical advertisements. As I analyzed in chapt er 4, the new Sanitary Code of 1926 provided the regulatory framework with which the DSP initiated a national campaign to control medical practice. Aware of the limitations that the lack of a regulation of article 4 of the Constitution imposed, the sanitar y police in Mexico City and sanitary delegates in the rest of the nation loosely implemented this campaign, seldom imposing the fines that the sanitary code imposed during the remaining years of the 1920s . 35 Sanitary delegates had been playing this role si nce the late 1920s. They supervised specific neighborhoods, collecting the names printed on the ads of medical consulting offices that populated the urban landscape. They then contrasted the collected names of medical practitioners to those included in the medical registry. Whenever they found a mismatch, they summoned the offender, notified him/her about the sanitary regulations that forbade the way (s)he advertised medical services, and let the offender go. ELHM graduates regarded these actions as \"hostil e 35 There were certainly fines. According to the annual report from the DSP Office of Demography and the Practice of Medicine of 1926 in December there had only been one single fine of $100 pesos to someone who advertised m edical services without having his degree registered with the DSP. If we trust this information, the annual report of 1926 accounts for 4 practitioners fi ned in 1926. The annual report of 1929 informed that those practitioners who did not register their de grees \"were summoned by this office [of Demography and the Practice of Medicine] to visit the lawyer of the office, who tried to convince them to fulfill the requirements [of the sanitary code which were] applicable to them. Where it proceeded, sanctions w ere applied.\" See \"Informes mensuales de registro de y Ejercicio de la Medicina del 1o. de julio de 1926 al 30 de comprendido 1\u00ba. julio de 1928 al 30 de 1929.\" in AHSS, SP, P, S, 11, 9; 10, 12; and 11, 27. 272 acts, [...] imposing heavy fines, and harassing [homeopaths] in ways that made notably difficult the practice of their profession.\"36 The regularization of this school in 1930 shifted both DSP policies and their target. Until the 1930s the DSP only request ed local sanitary authorities to send lists of medical practitioners in the locality, but after the authorization of the ELHM, and other free schools in 1930 and 1931, the DSP issued and distributed all over the country elaborated guidelines that cautiousl y detailed the procedures sanitary delegates needed to follow when they denounced illegal medical practice. Those practitioners who were suspicious of illegal practice were summoned in to the local sanitary office or municipal government office to declare if s/he practiced medicine with a title or not. The sanitary delegate's report needed to quote the way the practitioner advertised his/her services and the way s/he presented her/himself to potential customers. If there was physical evidence of the practit ioner's publicity, the latter needed to accept that s/he personally requested that specific publicity .37 This specific form of procedure obeyed legal reasoning. If a practitioner explicitly assumed his/her authorship in the medical advertisement in question, (s)he would immediately be held responsible for violating the Sanitary Code. But legal clarity did no t preclude suing from those aggravated learned practitioners who knew that medical practice was free in Mexico and that sanitary authorities' intervention was a form of restriction to their practice. The reaction of most practitioners who graduated from fr ee medical schools was particularly intense after the authorization of these 36 Correspondence from A. P\u00e9rez M., member of the Federation of Unions of the Federal District to Bernardo Gast\u00e9lum, head of the DSP, on August 27, 1928, in AHSS, SP, EM, 10, 17. 37 Letter from Genaro Escalona, head of the office of biostatistics, industrial hygiene and medical practice, addressed to sanitary agents Tlaxcala, Puebla, 2, 1931. A HSS, SP, SJ, 28, 16. 273 schools at the turn of the 1930s. Lawsuits against the DSP for fining practitioners who improperly advertised their services appear in the DSP archives starting from this period. The following cases exemplify how sanitary authorities carried out this policy in Mexico City. Antonio Herrera Bravo had graduated from the ELMP. In the early 1930s he offered his services with the following advertisement: Medical and Surgical Consulting Office of Dr. Antonio Herrera Bravo, with officially recognized title. Former director of the General Hospital of Chilpancingo, Guerrero. Sanitary delegate and former director of the Civil Hospital of Texcoco, M\u00e9xico. Sanitary delegate and former head of the sanitary sections at the Army. Collaborator of the gazette \"Medicina\" edited in the National School of Medicine of Mexico. Specialty in treating women and children diseases. Medical electricity.38 On November 8, 1933, the DSP's office of legal affairs summoned him to testify if this ad referred to him. Herrera Bravo acknowledged that he was the person this ad referred to. Consequently the head of the DSP Office of Legal Affairs advised him to comply with articles 155 (about the responsibility of all med ical practitioners to notify their change of address to the DSP) and 158 (about proper medical advertising) of the Sanitary Code. He replied that he had complied with everything that the article 155 stipulated and that he had registered his degree with the Medical Division of the Army and that he would register it with the DSP as soon as possible .39 But he did not. A week later, Herrera Bravo sued President Plutarco El\u00edas Calles for issuing the Sanitary Code of 1926, and the DSP, for asking him to exclude in formation about his medical degree in his prescriptions and consulting office ad, actions he believed were unconstitutional because they obstructed his free medical practice .40 He did not win the case, neither at a local court nor its appeal to the SCJN. Th e DSP showed evidence of the meeting that 38 Certificate from the DSP Office of Legal Affairs to Manuel Gea Gonz\u00e1lez, Ministry of the DSP, in AHSS, SP, SJ, 38, 12, pp. 16. 39 Report from the DSP's office of legal affairs to the minister of the DSP with information about the case of Dr. Antonio Herrera B ravo.

AHSS, SP, SJ, 38, 12, pp. 3 -6. 274 the head of the Office of Legal Affairs had with Antonio Bravo, and the latter was not able to demonstrate that sanitary authorities forbade his medical practice. Having established a formal procedure to prosecute practitioners who illegally advertised their services gave sanitary authorities the evidence they needed to start winning this type of cases at the court. In another case, sanitary authorities fined Juan F. Lecanda on October 6, 1933, for persistently adv ertise his medical services using the word \"doctor\", without having a degree registered with the DSP .41 Lecanda requested a revision of his case, though he also paid the fine in case the DSP did not change his position. As he expected, the DSP did not withd raw its charges and he sued the sanitary office. He requested the DSP withdraw from the fine, for its accusations of having advertised his services without an authorized medical degree, and for forbidding him to advertise his service as physician .42 Interes tingly, the court's verdict conceded his first request but the court agreed with the DSP on the issue of medical advertising and medical practice. The court explicitly required that the DSP did not consider the cash deposit as a fine, in other words, that that there were no material consequences for infringing the sanitary code, arguing that the article 158 of the sanitary code regulated the medical profession and consequently placed sanitary regulation over article 4 of the Constitution .43 Sanitary authorit ies did not want that this idea established a precedent that further demands used against the DSP. Rather they wanted to emphasize the idea that the sanitary code only regulated medical advertising and not medical practice. For this reason they requested a revision to the SCJN, even 41 Sue from Juan F. Lecanda against the DSP, in AHSS, SP, SJ, 37, 16, p. 2. 42 Ths DSP agreed on the first two actions, but argued that they were applied according to the law. It did not agree with the last action. According to the DSP's report, the DSP never prohibited Lecanda to advertise his services as doctor. See Report from Manuel Gea Gonz\u00e1lez to the judge of the 4th District, on December 12, 1933, i n AHSS, SP, SJ, 37, 16, p. 4. 43 Correspondence from judge 5th of District, Juan A. Coronado, to Manuel Gea Gonz\u00e1lez, DSP Ministry, on April 10, 1934, in AHSS, SP, SJ, 37, 16, p. 9. 275 after the local court had denied that the DSP was restricting Juan Lecanda's medical practice .44 With a decade -long experience of lawsuits from ELHM graduates and after realizing what their political mobilization could achieve, t he DSP was not willing to give graduates from free school any legal resource that helped them to get into the registry. This effort did work on the ground, as the case of Ernesto Guill\u00e9n Ur\u00eda, a graduate from the Free Homeopathic Institute of Mexico [ Instituto Libre Homeop\u00e1tico de M\u00e9xico , ILHM] partero [physician -surgeon and male midwife], exemplifies. He advertised his services with the following ad: ERNESTO GUILLEN URIA Homeopath Consulting Hours 11 to 1, 5 to 8 Internal Medicine. Women and Children Diseases Homeopathic Medical Consulting Office E. Guill\u00e9n Ur\u00eda45 On March 7 1935, Guill\u00e9n Ur\u00eda visited the DSP Office of Legal Affairs and acknowledged that he was the person whom the ad referred to. According to the repo rt of this office, authorities notified him about the modifications of the new sanitary code of 1934. Authorities did not proceed immediately even after acknowledging that the DSP had previously warned Guill\u00e9n Ur\u00eda about the irregular way he displayed info rmation in his medical ads. According to the report the practitioner agreed to fulfill the requirements of the sanitary code and the sanitary office gave him fifteen days to do it. But Guill\u00e9n Ur\u00eda sued the DSP and asked that the latter withdraw from its r equirement to remove his ads and that gave adequate procedure to the demand to revise his case .46 The lawsuit exposed the contradictions of the practitioner. He argued that the DSP had verbally requested him to remove his ads if he wanted to avoid the 44 File with documents regarding Juan F. Lecanda's lawsuit, in AHSS, SP, SJ, 37, 16. 45 Report from the DSP's Office of Legal Affairs to the minister of the DSP with information about the case of Ernesto Gull\u00e9n Ur\u00eda in in AHSS, SP, SJ, 45, 18, p. 25. 46 Lawsui t against the DSP on April 3, 1935, in AHSS, SP, SJ, 45, 18, p. 5 -8. 276 corre sponding fine. Accordingly, he asked for a revision of his case, but the sanitary department replied that he had violated articles 447 and 448 of the sanitary code. The DSP Office of Legal Affairs demonstrated that there was no threat, that the practitione r agreed to comply with the requirements of the sanitary code, and that the DSP revised his case responding that it could not make exceptions to the law .47 Moreover, it also showed evidence that the sanitary delegates had asked the practitioner to add the l egend \"without legally recognized degree\" to his ad rather than asking him to remove it, and that acknowledging the regulations in the s anitary code, he reiteratively \u2014 on July 7, 1934, and on March 7, 1935 \u2014 had previously made commitments to modify his p ublicity. The substantial evidence favored the DSP and Ernesto Guill\u00e9n Ur\u00eda lost the case,48 proving that the DSP new policy to prosecute illegal medical advertising and practice did work on the ground. The application of the DSP's guidelines to cope with irregular practitioners and their ads was less straightforward in the countryside. Regardless of the procedures to denounce illegal ads and prosecute the practitioners who sued them, it was not easy for sanitary delegates to evaluate the legal status of a particular practitioner, especially when newspapers reported on the conflict between graduates from free medical schools and the DSP. For instance, just a few days after the DSP sent the guidelines on how to denounce irregular medical advertisements and pr actice on June, 1931, Ildefonso M\u00e9ndez A., a sanitary agent from Pachuca, Hidalgo, addressed his concern of how to proceed with homeopaths who insisted in advertise their services using the title of doctor .49 His concern was major since only two of all home opaths who practiced in the city had their titles registered in the department. Moreover, he was uncertain about the way to proceed 47 Report from Aquilino Villanueva, DSP Minister, on April 9, 1935 to the court, in AHSS, SP, SJ, 45, 18, p. 9-11. 48 AHSS, SP, SJ, 45, 18. 49 Letter of Dr. Ildefonso M\u00e9ndez addressed to Li c. Francisco V\u00e1zquez P\u00e9rez, June 12, 1931. AHSS, SP, SJ, 28, 22, p. 2. 277 since he had read in El Universal Gr\u00e1fico a few weeks before that the sanitary department was sued by a homeopath for not le tting him use the title of \"Doctor\". Francisco V\u00e1zquez P\u00e9rez, head of the DSP Office of Legal Affairs, replied that all medical practitioners needed to comply with article 158 of the sanitary code .50 He also ratified that all medical practitioners, with or without a title, needed to inform the DSP about the professional s services they provided and the addresses of their consulting offices (art 155 of the sanitary code). He clarified that \"not only those who practice the homeopathic system, but anyone withou t a legally recognized degree have the obligation to not call themselves doctors, physicians or professionals in general, while they lack a valid degree that allows them to do so\".51 In Morelia, Michoac\u00e1n, Dr. Antonio D\u00edaz, president of the Sanitary Board of Morelia faced a similar situation regarding homeopathy. On November 10, 1933, he asked the head of the DSP if the sanitary department registered degrees issued by the Free Homeopa thic Institute [ Instituto Libre Homeop\u00e1tico ]. V\u00e1zquez P\u00e9rez replied that the sanitary department did not register those decrees because the school was not official .52 While straightforward, the response from sanitary authorities in the city stood out for i ts indoctrinating tone and for not acknowledging that a legal status of a decree depended on each local state regulations. For instance, the state of Hidalgo recognized degrees from the ELHM as legal in the 1920s .53 This attitude evidences the urgent need o f sanitary authorities to stop the spread of graduates from free medical schools to the countryside. The phenomenon of free schools was mainly located in Mexico City, though cases like the ELMP showed sanitary 50 Response to the letter of Dr. Ildefonoso M\u00e9ndez A., by Francisco V\u00e1zquez P\u00e9rez, July 31, 1931.

The matter became more urgent because the news about the cases graduates from free medical schools won at the SCJN spread to the countryside, apparently m aking sanitary delegates hesitant about the application of the sanitary code. Obligating homeopaths to comply might have not been easy. For instance, Ildefonso M\u00e9ndez asked V\u00e1zquez P\u00e9rez for a \"way though which I can obligate homeopaths from this town not use the title of Doctor.\"54 Moreover, the assurance that lawsuits against the DSP for obligating practitioners to comply with the regulation on medical advertising did not pass might have inclined V\u00e1zquez P\u00e9rez to reassure sanitary delegates about the their role as surveyors of fulfillment of the sanitary code, rather than complicating their scenario with details about the local regulation of medical training. The persisting dictatorial attitude of sanitary authorities during the early 1930s made that homeop aths and other graduates from free schools mobilized at the national level when they received news that the sanitary code would be reformed in 1934. \"Revolutionary Medicine\"?: the Institutionalization of Revolutionary Institutions Stands out Over Homeopat hy for Working -Class Mexicans On August 24, 1934, a new and reformed Sanitary Code was issued. The reaction to the new reforms varied among different actors. The national press received it with enthusiasm. El Universal one of the major diaries of the capit al believed that it represented a great step against the \"medical charlatanry\" .55 In contrast, Alfonso Pruneda, a former DSP officer in the early 1920s, believed that the \"campaign against charlatanism\" needed to be carried out with more intensity through a ll possible means, suggesting that improvements in the new legislation fall 54 Letter of Dr. Ildefonso M\u00e9ndez addressed to Lic. Francisco V\u00e1zquez P\u00e9rez, June 12, 1931. AHSS, SP, SJ, 28, 22, p. 2. 55 See \"Un dique al ejercicio de la medicina por charlatantes\", El Universal , September 2, 1934. 279 short on what was required .56 The way he described these limitations suggests that he believed sanitary authorities coped well with the problem of charlatans who lacked professional degrees, but could not contain those who indeed had a degree and because of this were \"more dangerous\". As the vignette with which I initiated this chapter and chapters 5 and 6 indicate, the DSP clearly identified who these \"dangerous\" practitioners were, those graduated from free schools of medicine, though they or other ENM graduates rarely referred to them explicitly in their professional journals, classifying them under the obscure and poorly defined term \"charlatans\". As analyzed in chapter 4, the ref orms to the section on medical practice in the sanitary code marginalized even more the places where practitioners who lacked a medical degree, who had one from free medical schools, or who had one that sanitary authorities did not acknowledge as legal cou ld offer their services. Foreseeing the possible actions that this particular group of practitioners could take, the Union of Medical Doctors of the Federal District [ Sindicato de M\u00e9dicos Cirujanos del Distrito Federal ] policed their mobilizations and made them public .57 The union denounced in its journal those affected by the sanitary code who had gathered on 56 Alfonso Pruneda read his opinion in the National Academy of Medicine on February 20, 1935. See Pruneda, \"El Nuevo C\u00f3digo Sanitario,\" 400 -01. 57 The union had b een working, though with the name of Asociaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica Mexicana , since the early 1920s. A group of ENM graduates created this association on June 23, 1919 with the aim to morally, materially, and intellectually improve the conditions of the Mexican medical practitioners all over the nation. Eventually, this society turned into the union sometime around the late 1920s or early 1930s. This change was signaled by the name of its publication; the association published the bulletin Asociaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica Mexicana and the union published the journal Acci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica . Unfortunately, earlier and later publication year caps of these journals do not suggest a better estimate of the transition from a professional society to a medical union. Yet that it happened in these ye ars when the state started to support free medical schools is indicative of ENM graduates' organization to seek for larger state support. Both the society and the union had a specific group organized to \"combat charlatanism\" and frequently published critiq ues and actions taken against practitioners they considered a threat to the profession, as when the ENMH joined the UNM in the early 1920s or when in 1934 the 1st congress of professionals of Mexico gathered in Mexico City from which homeopaths, both gradu ates from the ENMH and ELMH, were dismissed. For the creation of the Mexican Medical Association see chapter 5. For critiques against homeopathy and the ENMH see chapter 3 and 5. For the reactions against homeopaths in 1934 and 35 see just as a major examp le papers see Acci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica ,V, 5-6, 7, and 13 -14. 280 August 30 and planned to fight against the enforcement of the code. Consequently, it suggested a series of measures to counteract practitioners' actio ns; notifying the President and the DSP Head that the union sided with the enforcement of the code, convincing other medical associations in the country t o do the same, and designing measures to \"neutralize the activities of charlatans organized against th e new Federal Sanitary Code\" .58 But homeopaths and other graduates from free schools had been politically active earlier in 1934. That the reforms to the sanitary code passed and were issued in August of that year sustains this chapter's argument about the limits of resistance against the sanitary dictatorship. Yet the analysis of this attempt to resist a new reform to the sanitary code reveals the persistence of homeopathy as a medical system and service provided and used by the working class, by those who either did not have access to or could not afford both an elite medical training at elite medical schools and physicians, most of whom were located in urban centers. This is not to say that homeopathic doctors did not follow the geographical distribution o f ENM -graduated doctors in the 1930s, after all most of ELHM or ENMH graduates stayed and practiced in Mexico City .59 Rather the waves of correspondence that President Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez and sanitary authorities received is evidence that homeopathy cont inued being provided and consumed as a form of domestic or communitarian medicine both in urban centers and rural communities. Just as during the Porfiriato homeopathic doctors and unlicensed homeopathic practitioners argued 58 Correspondence from Juan Cejudo, Dr. Balend\u00f3n Gil, Carmen Ben\u00edtez, E. J. Bustillo, F.

Only 20% of graduates from homeopathic medical schools practiced in the countryside. See E. Petrie Hyle, \"International Homeopathic Medical Directory,\" Directory of homeopathic physicians , ed. American Institute of Homeopathy (New York: American Institute of Homeopathy, 1931), vol. ; see also that homeopathy fit the economi c needs of the working class, but in the early 1930s they appropriated the rhetoric of the revolution, placing homeopathy as the epitome of the revolution in medical matters, as the \"revolutionary medicine\". Against the monopolistic efforts to control the medical marketplace carried out by sanitary authorities and the rest of the medical profession, homeopaths tried to convince the president, the congress, and the public opinion that homeopathy was a mild and effective therapy that was suitable for the work ing class because it was harmless and cheap. Consequently, they demanded that a government that sustained the revolution's ideals of social justice did not side on the monopolistic desires of ENM graduates and sanitary authorities. What motivated the mobi lization of homeopaths and other graduates from free schools was a new project to regulate article 4 of the Constitution initiated in December, 1933 .60 The leaders of this new regulatory attempt requested all professional organizations and interested citizens to submit their proposals to the commission .61 The possibility to be part of the conversations t o regulate the medical profession opened a fierce co ntroversy between homeopaths and allopaths , who used the journals of their professional societies and unions as well as the public press to expose their opinions about the differences in the medical system each group endorsed, their understanding of what c onstituted adequate medical training, and the 60 Alberto Bremauntz and Alberto Coria, deputies of a political group within the Chamber of Deputies, the Bloque Nacional Revolutionario [National Revolutionary Bloc], initiated the project; see El Universal Grafico , December 11, 1933, in AHSS, SP, EM, 15, 5, pp. 1. 61 Some homeopa ths and graduates from free schools specifically sent their responses to the commission's list with questions about how to undertake a project that regulated art 4 of the constitution, but others took the opportunity to address other related issued and sta rted sending letters to President Abelardo Rodr\u00edguez. For the commission's list of questions see correspondence from Xavier Gaxiola, particular secretary to President Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez to Narciso Bassols, ministry of AGN, ALR, 011/13, 4o. constitucional\" in AHSS, SP, SJ, 29, 14. For letters to the Presidency see AGN, ALR, 011/11, 1267. 282 consequences these two issues had for the regulation of the medical profession .62 Unions and professional societies that represented both medical groups and other professions gathered in the Chamber of Deputies on December 18, 1933, but the entrenched differences between allopaths and homeopaths about the existence of two types of medical degrees granted by two different medical schools did not help the discussion to do any progress .63 It was this political scenar io together with the history of marginalization of homeopathic pra ctices by sanitary authorities t hat motivated the wave of correspondence that requested the participation of homeopaths and graduates from free schools to participate in the discussions to r eform the sanitary code .64 They felt compelled to do it for, as one unlicensed homeopathic practitioner put it, As allopaths already had their first defeat in the preliminary meetings in the Chamber of Deputies, they are planning new strategies [... one of w hich] is issuing a new sanitary code with a federal scope, applicable all over the republic. Without doubt, [allopaths] will take advantage [of this opportunity] to include paragraphs that in fact rule the practice of professional medicine [and that would be] detrimental to homeopathy.65 In January 1934, President Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez received about a hundred letters from both homeopathic doctors and unlicensed practitioners requesting that sanitary authorities incorporate homeopaths into the discussion of the reforms to the sanitary code or that otherwise 62 For instance, in response to critiques from \"allopathic do ctors\", the Mexican Homeopathic League addressed President Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez to let him know that anytime the government could verify the quality of their academic curriculum. See correspondence exchange from the League to the President from December 1 5 to December 21, 1933, in AGN, ALR, 011/13, 1267. Also see m\u00e9dicos y home\u00f3patas\" El Universal Gr\u00e1fico .

December 27, 1933. 64 It was also in this context that homeopaths and graduates from free schools addressed President Abelardo L. Rodriguez to request the legal recognition of some free medical schools, such as in the case of the ELMP that I analyzed above. 65 The other strate gy was to organize a Congress of Professionals that gathered all professional societies and unions to agree on a regulation that benefited all those interested. Correspondence from T. Q. Vergara to President Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez on January 22, 1934, in AH SS, SP, EM, 13, 14, p. 2. 283 these reforms did not marginalize their practice even further .66 About 20% of them came from Mexico City or the less populated areas surrounding the city; another 20% came from Michoac\u00e1n, Coahuila, M\u00e9xico, and Jalisco; the rest came from other 18 states and even one from Per\u00fa.67 Most practitioners had graduated from the ILHM or ELMP and only a couple had registered with the DSP; some practitioners called themselves \"doctors\" despite not being included in the registry. All graduates from the ELHM were registered and all of them signed using the prefix \"doctor\". Most practitioners and doctors were members of local or national medical associations such as the Mexican Homeopathic Confederation, the Mexican Homeop athic League, the Homeopathic Society Dr. Hering, the Homeopathic Society of Puebla, the Homeopathic Society of Sinaloa, the Society of Homeopathic Doctors of Durango, the Homeopathic Society of Guerrero, and the Homeopathic Association of Doctors from La Laguna . This mobilization had no precedents in terms of the groups that participated in it, the way the actions those groups took, and the geographical origins of the complaints. If homeopathic doctors were the only ones who protested as individuals in pre vious years, this time homeopathic practitioners and even patients summed their requests to homeopathic doctors who acted within their professional societies and unions. Most of the correspondence simply requested that homeopaths could participate in the elaboration of the new sanitary code, and Manuel F. Madrazo, head of the DSP, or Francisco V\u00e1zquez P\u00e9rez, head of the DSP's Office of Medical Practice, just replied that their opinions 66 Approximately 60 homeopathic practitioners, 10 homeopathic doctors, and 70 patients. See AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 5; AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 11; AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 12; AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 14 67 The majority of petition letters issued by homeopa thic practitioners or doctors came from Mexico City (about 40), followed by the state of Michoac\u00e1n. Other states were only represented by one, two or three letters (Morelos, Coahuila, and Tampaulipas). Puebla and Veracruz are special cases, for if patients are considered, then about 65 persons from Puebla sent petition letters to the President and the head of the DSP, and 14 from Veracruz. 284 would be taken into consideration .68 Opinions varied amongst those homeop aths who responded to DSP's invitation. Some homeopaths sent a simple letter notifying the DSP that they sided with the opinion of the Mexican Homeopathic Confederation .69 Others elaborated on critiques to the DSP's regulation of medical practice. In genera l, these letters requested that the DSP authorized the practice of homeopaths whether doctors or unlicensed practitioners. This could be achieved, so these letter proposed, by regulating articles 4 of the Constitution , by providing venues in the sanitary c ode that allowed the practice of homeopaths, by allowing the registration of degrees granted by free medical schools, among other legal means. When arguing in favor of the legal practice of homeopathy in the country, homeopaths and their patients used a s ocial democratic rhetoric to align with the revolutionary rhetoric of government authorities to obtain their support. One aspect of this rhetoric was to p ortray the conflict between homeopaths and allopaths as a class struggle. For example, Dr. Jos\u00e9 M. Mendoza, a member of the Homeopathic Society of Puebla, believed that the attitude against homeopaths resulted from the elitist education of allopaths, their close relationship to the political class, and their ability to obtain bureaucratic positions . On th e contrary [to what happened in the Porfiriato , he said,] today in a time of liberty [...] revolutionary governors in conjunction with their professional allies, unrealized professional who issue laws, such as in Puebla and other states, fight against the ci vilization and the Mexican nationalism. [...A]llopaths, taking advantage of their position in the government, or as legislators, [...] want to impose a STATE MEDICINE to the Mexican people. Has by any chance Mexico gone years back in scientific matters? Our li beral institutions and laws [...] deny a RELIGION OF THE STATE . Why the MEDICINE OF THE STATE , which allopathic physicians want to impose , is not condemned on the same grounds and in the name of scientific freedom?\"70 68 See El Universal , January 26, 1934, and La Prensa , January 27, 1934; El Nacional , January 25, 1934. 69 Like Mariano Torres Pico, Pedro Castro, Santiago J. L\u00f3pez, Ra\u00fal Ram\u00edrez Guzm\u00e1n and Felipe P\u00e9rez, Rodrigo M\u00e9ndez Guerrero and 70 Correspondence from Dr. Jos\u00e9 M. Mendo za, January 11, 1934, AHSS, SP, EM, 11, pp. 2 -4. 285 Mar\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez de Origel, head of a beneficence institution that protected women and teenagers in Guadalajara, argued that homeopathy sided the \"proletariat, the working class and the people\", and for that reason she considered it \"revolutionary and democratic .71 And patients described the benefits of homeopathy as ones that fitted the least affluent class. A. Maga\u00f1a argued that homeopathy was economic and efficient, which made it a suitable therapy for the \"working class and peasants\" .72 The privileged position of allopaths allowed them to f avor laws that banned homeopathic practice. Class struggle could also be interpreted as professional competition and consequently the conflict was pictured as an economic one where patients became both arbiters and victims. Dr. Fidel M. Garcia, member of the Homeopathic Society of Sinaloa, believed that allopaths did not like homeopathy because patients preferred it and this reduced allopaths' income; having laws that allowed \"homeopathic practitioners to offer their services only where there was no licens ed physician could be interpreted as a defense of a mercantile monopoly , and not as a sanitary measure t hat benefited the whole society\", he said .73 Patients' preference was evident in a letter from 13 patients and one homeopathic practitioner from Tuxpan, Veracruz, who had used allopathy without any result until they used homeopathy and they healed. They argued, consequently, that allopathy was the therapeutic approach that killed, not homeopathy. Juan Zepeda Garbay, a practitioner from Tenancingo, believed that allopaths with its elitist education, political connections, and government positions were trying to build a professional monopoly; he also thought that if the government allowed free medical practice, the public would become the judge of what was ri ght or wrong in medical science, undermining allopaths' privileged 71 AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 5, pp. 24 72 AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 15, pp. 39 and 50 73 AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 12, pp. 27 286 position .74 Enrique Garc\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez, a practitioner from Mazatl\u00e1n, Sinaloa, located the origin of the conflict in mercantilism, but contrary to Juan Zepeda, he visualized a future of patien ts' exploitation without the homeopathic counterweight, if their political position tilted the outcome in favor of allopaths .75 Some patients like Paula G. de Rivera \u2014 and 4 more patients \u2014 believed that patient's choice favored homeopaths and that it was p recisely for this reason that allopaths considered homeopaths true competitors and attacked them .76 Mar\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez de Origel translated medical approaches to economic reasons that favored homeopathy. For her, homeopaths' resistance to use patent medicines, and their wide use of national plants, practices that opposed allopaths' preferences, promoted the growth of a national economy .77 A third issue was the status of homeopathy as medical knowledge based on scientific foundations and the access to scientific m edical knowledge and consequently proper medical training to the working class. Francisco A. Gonz\u00e1lez, a practitioner from Coahuila argued that homeopathy had the same legal rights as allopathy because the former was as scientific as the latter. Ram\u00f3n Garc \u00eda Morales, a violinist from the National Conservatory in Mexico City, considered that homeopathy had scientific foundations and that he would turn into a non -believer only until there was clear evidence of the empiricism and lack of scientific principles in it.78 Moreover, he argued that the only way to solve the conflict was recognizing homeopathy's scientific foundations and supporting the ELHM which trained doctors without the economic support from the government .79 In the same line of reasoning, Maria Go nz\u00e1lez de Origel 74 AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 5, pp. 69 75 AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 5, pp. 79 76 AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 11, pp. 83 77 AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 5, pp. 71 -73 78 AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 11, pp. 53 79 AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 5, pp. 67 -68. 287 considered homeopathy a science that needed to be included in the educational system because it was useful. She argued that she had been successfully using it in the institution she headed .80 Homeopaths and their patients did not like being held as charlatans neither for their therapeutic beliefs nor for their training. Jos\u00e9 M. Mendoza said that homeopaths had documents that proved their long training which turn them into \"authentic homeopathic doctors\", contrary to what sanitary authorities argued. Yet if sanitary authorities accused free medical schools of lacking enough practical training, it was the government's responsibility, for how could someone demand high quality medical training from a free school, when a short minded government s toned the school? How could a free school be efficient when a governor issued draconian decrees against homeopathic doctors? How could someone demand with such na\u00efvet\u00e9 that free schools trained top -class professionals, when those schools never received eco nomic support from the government, as official ones did? How could an authority, however well intentioned, with such carelessness, request such a high -quality medical training in free schools if precisely the same authority obstructed its operations and de nied clinical practice to free schools' students in government hospitals?81 Like others, he suggested the complete legal recognition of homeopathic professional education and the official recognition of homeopathy as a medical science . One of the letters is particularly relevant because it radically contrasted with other homeopaths' perspective and Juan Mendoza's in particular. Generally ELHM graduates had a special appreciation for their school. The spirit of altruism and the flag of ho meopathy pushed them to praise the education they had received from this particular medical free school, but Dr. Ruben Reyes Segura felt deceived by the school. He had two titles, one from the ELHM and one from the UNAM. He explained to sanitary authoritie s that he first studied homeopathy at the ELHM because he believed that it had scientific principles, but that after four years of studies he realized that both the homeopathic doctrine and the school were not trustworthy. Therefore, Dr. 80 AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 5, pp. 24. 81 AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 12, pp. 5 -7. 288 Ruben Reyes decide d to study medicine at the ENM, where he finally realized that the homeopathic school only exploited \"the ignorance of the masses, protected by the law that gave it legal status\". Arguing that he never practiced homeopathy and had only practice \"the other medicine\", he believed that his \"mistake had already been corrected\" and that his honesty \"had erased any stain on his medical career\". Foreseeing that he could be fined for prescribing medicines he was not entitled to after the enforcement of the new Sani tary Code, he requested the head of the DSP's Office of Medical Practice and Demography to erase his name from the section of homeopaths, but the sanitary authority replied that the Directory was already published .82 Only the Union of Homeopathic Physician s and the Mexican Homeopathic League offered a systematic critique of the parts of the Sanitary Code of 1928 that directly affected medical practice to homeopaths, critiques and suggestions that homeopaths wanted to be included in the new one. The Mexican Homeopathic Confederation to which several homeopaths pledge allegiance endorsed the document offered by the League. The union, represented by Dr. Othon Johnson, a graduate of the ELHM, and by Dr. Rosendo Rojas Esta\u00f1ol, also an ELHM graduate, criticized th e criteria followed to register degrees issued by free schools, the timing when a doctor was obliged to issue a death certificate, in the sanitary code of 1926, and the intention to ban homeopaths from the practice of surgery and obstetrics in the new one .83 The union believed that free schools' degrees should be recognized as official, if the titles fulfilled certain criteria. They needed to have been previously recognized by any federal or local government through any of its offices; the issuing medical sc hool needed to have academic programs officially validated by such offices; and both the medical degrees and the free school 82 AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 5, pp. 88 -89 83 AHSS, SP, SM, 13, 5, pp. 81 -84 289 needed to fulfill other specific requirements established by the granting government. According to the union's opinion, doctors wer e obliged to provide a medical certificate only if their patient died 48 hours after they issued the last prescription. Families of the deceased patient and police agents , the union argued , did not have any medical training and requested death certificates when doctors could no longer be held responsible for the death person, or when the patient or its family did not adequately follow the doctor's prescription, discontinued it, or had done extensive use of other therapies, such as home remedies, potions, or spiritualist interventions, without the doctors' consent. In its final point, the union complained about the intention to marginalize homeopaths' practice by considering them only specialists in internal medicine, without the proper training to offer thei r services as surgeons or obstetricians. Doctors from the \"traditional school\" wanted to reserve surgical and obstetrical knowledge to their own and failed to understand that homeopaths were also trained as doctors and, consequently, were able to fulfill c ompletely their role in the society, the union concluded. The opinions of the Mexican Homeopathic League coincided with some of the Union's opinions and advanced other ones. For instance, the League pointed out that the new sanitary code needed to conside r free schools from states beyond the Federal District, but argued that it was necessary to have a new government office beyond the UNAM that validated free schools' degrees and their academic curricula. The League believed that homeopaths were trained as surgeons and obstetricians, but also as a homeopathic pharmacist. Consequently, it demanded that the right of every graduate of a homeopathic school to be in charge of pharmacies and dispensaries be observed in the new code. On the issue of death certifica tes, the League considered that it was the duty of judicial authorities to provide this and other types of certificates that demanded expert knowledge. 290 The League's letter highlighted how the sanitary code of 1926 obstructed homeopathic doctors' practice a nd how the code contradicted the Constitution, yet its suggestions to reform the code revealed the League's unawareness of how the sanitary police proceeded or its lack of legal experience. This suggests that while supporting medical schools, the League, b eing integrated by ELHM graduates who were already registered with the DSP, saw the economic benefits of the sanitary control of medical practice, once they were on the side of regular practitioners. The way the code restricted medical advertisements confl icted with article 4 of the Constitution, though they agreed with advertising clearly the origin of their degree or the lack of it. A similar situation happened with the ability of sanitary authorities to eliminate previously registered doctors who did not comply with new laws. This regulation opposed to article 6 of the Constitution, which stipulated that the law could not be retroactively applied. The League believed that only in cases of fake degrees or when the degree was not backed up by proper trainin g the registry could be withdrawn, a proposition that evidence the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of the League and its lack of knowledge of the situation of other free medical schools, such as the ELMP or the ELOE. One of the most important issues in terms of therapeutic tools that homeopaths could make use of as surgeons and obstetricians was narcotics. The League requested that homeopaths could use prohibited plants such as Cannabis indica , Cannabis sativa , and Opium , based on the extensive evidence homeopaths had of their therapeutic effectiveness at infinitesimal doses. On the other side, it demanded their right as surgeons and obstetricians to use narcotics at high doses, for palliative as well as anesthetic purpos es. This contradiction is just the surface of a deeper problem amongst the medical profession which was the wide variety of therapeutic approaches and the anxiety of sanitary authorities to regulate who was properly trained to use a 291 specific therapeutic ap proach and how specific practitioners approached the use of such therapeutic tools. However fascinating the history of the production, cultivation, transformation, synthesis, commercialization, and consumption of medicinal plants and other commercial and non-commercial drugs might be, this topic is beyond the scope of this dissertation. Yet the activity of homeopaths as retailers of their own specific homeopathic drugs made them the target not only of sanitary policies that aimed to regulate the production and retailing of pharmaceutical products in the 1920s and 30s, but also of the growing community of professional pharmacists, who regarded homeopathic pharmaceutical activity as an intromission to their professional activities and as competitor in the mark etplace of medical commodities .84 Just as with the Congress of Professionals from which homeopaths were dismissed, they were never required to attend any meeting to discuss the reforms to the new sanitary code. Madrazo publicly acknowledged that he would l isten to homeopaths suggestions and even asked them to submit their opinion; these written opinions did not produce any change in the sanitary code of 1934. Moreover, the modifications to the section on medical practice did not listen to homeopaths' sugges tions. In fact new modifications openly marginalized homeopaths' medical practice in the way homeopaths had anticipated in their letters early that year. The Union of Homeopathic Physicians complained to sanitary authorities using the same arguments alread y 84 Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez's and Pascual Bielsa's homeopathic dispensaries were the first examples of these tensions between the Superior Board of Health and homeopaths in the 1860s and 70s (see particularly chapter 1 and 4). Pharmacists complained that homeopaths f illed up themselves their own prescriptions in \"Intereses profesionales. La homeopat\u00eda. Falta de debe por La Farmacia V.9 (1896). The DSP prosecut ed homeopaths who unlawfully opened homeopathic dispensaries, particularly after 1926. See Jose I.

The lawsuit concentrated mainly in the explicit prohibition for homeopaths to prescribe narcotics at regular doses and for pharmacists to fill homeopaths' prescriptions of narcotics (arts. 413-416), though it also pointed out the intromission of the sanitary code in t he regulation of medical practice . More than exposing homeopaths' arguments that justified their right and proper training to use anesthetics in surgery and prescribe narcotics in specific cases, the lawsuit offers an insight of how magistrates privileged the structure and duties of state institutions which stood for the social good rather than the constitutional rights of a few citizens. Homeopaths sued the President and the DSP at a local civilian court and they lost the case because, according to the verdict, the sanitary code was a piece of legislation that protected society's interests. If it was revoked to give rights back to homeopaths, the verdict would re instate a situation which the sanitary code intended to remediate in the first place. But when h omeopaths appealed this verdict to the SCJN, the Supreme Court acknowledged the excesses contained in the code, particularly regarding the prescription of narcotics and the intromission of sanitary authorities in the regulation of medical practice. When th e DSP appealed this resolution, the SCJN one more time acknowledged that the DSP's acts were susceptible to suspension, but the Supreme Court argued that it was more important \"for the society and the state that each organic institution fulfilled its 85 Correspondence from the Union of Homeopathic Physicians to the head of the DSP, September 24, 1934, AHSS, SP, SJ, 41, 10.

Having this as the central value of governance gave homeopaths no means to contest the sanitary dictatorship.86 Conclusions The triumph of advocates for the regularization of the Free School of Homeopathy of Mexico in 1929 and 1930 opened the possibility for other graduates from free medical schools in Mexico City to seek the regularization of their own medical schools and degrees. As I have shown in the f irst section of this chapter, these graduates took advantage of the presidential decrees that allowed them to seek the regularization of their schools with the Ministry of Public Education in 1930 and 1931. But the changing politics of the Maximato did not allow a consistent policy regarding the regulation of free schools and of professional education in general. The new Organic Law of the UNM in 1932 brought legal inconsistencies that both the SEP and the DSP took advantage of to get rid of the problem of regulating medical schools. The shifting role of the SEP from an office in favor of regulating medical schools to an office that opposed to it remains to be studied, yet an explanation can still be found either in the conflicting relationship between unive rsity authorities and the recently created office that aimed to regulate professional training within the SEP or in the state's need to establish a coherent state structure that regulated professional practice through adequate professional training, as the SCJN's resolution in favor of the sanitary code of 1934 suggests. In any case, with the SEP stepping back from its role as regulator of professional training, the DSP assumed such a role specifically for free medical schools. 86 The entire lawsuit is in AHSS, SP, SJ, 41, 10 . For the appeal's resolution see the report from the SCJN to President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas and his Ministry of Health in AHSS, SP, SJ, 41, 10, pp. 81 -84. 294 Sanitary authorities took ad vantage of the legal and government position of the DSP at the national level. The sanitary code made the medical registry the basis for enforcing a policy that marginalized free -schools graduates from advertising their services as professional medical doctors. At the same time, the presence of sanitary agents in the most important urban centers in the nation made feasible the prosecution of those practitioners who did not comply with regulations on medical advertising. The enforcement of these policies cre ated the need in free - schools graduates to be included in the medical registry. Yet, they believed they had the right to be included in the latter because their degrees were legal. After all not only had they received medical training in a medical school, but also some of their schools had been legally authorized. The cases analyzed in this chapter indicate that the DSP's resistance to register some of the free - schools -issued medical degrees was ideologically -based, rather than legally -based. In other words , the enforcement of the sanitary dictatorship to control medical practice was based on the anxieties of sanitary authorities rather than the potential or actual harm that free -schools graduates inflicted to their patients. The legal strategies devised by sanitary authorities to prevent these practitioners from enrolling in the sanitary code were dictatorial, intransigent, and illegal. Sanitary authorities were cautious when implementing such measures to prevent a flood of lawsuits as they had experienced d uring the 1920s with ELHM graduates. Consequently, sanitary authorities carefully aligned with regulations that allowed them to dismiss free -schools graduates' requests to be included in the medical registry. In turn, only exceptionally the latter were abl e to win lawsuits against the DSP and become \"legal\" medical doctors. However, it would be misleading to p ortray sanitary authorities as simply enforcing policies out of ideology. As I explained in chapter 5, the DSP did not originally enforce the regulat ions on medical practice contained in the sanitary code of 1926. And, as evidence in this 295 chapter suggest, even when enforcing it, sanitary authorities did not apply sanitary regulations unilaterally. Practitioners were summoned to the DSP's or the sanitar y agents' offices and offered an explanation of the regulation on medical advertising. They were fined only after receiving several warnings. This environment of communication between authorities and practitioners drastically changed after the ELHM obtaine d the state support in 1930. Thence, sanitary authorities changed their policy to promote compliance to a policy of enforcement through prosecution. This reaction was the product of sanitary authorities' realiz ation that \"charlatans\" who held a professiona l medical degree would not easily comply with sanitary regulations regarding medical practice and, moreover, that state policies on professional training backed them up. In other words, free -schools graduates happened to be a more politically active and ef fective group than sanitary authorities expected. The real problem for sanitary authorities in the 1930s was, as Pruneda put it, \"charlatans with a medical degree\". When these \"charlatans\" achieved a regular status, sanitary authorities responded using the vantage position they had in the government structure and did not let any resistance mobilization to overcome the sanitary dictatorship. The last ma jor mobilization of homeopaths \u2014 including practitioners, and patients; regular and irregular; licensed a nd without license \u2014 revealed that they had appropriated the working -class culture of organization typical of urban centers, particularly Mexico City, in the 1920s and 30s .87 The process through which homeopaths sought state support was not new. They had be en requesting the presidential support since the late 19th century with Porfirio D\u00edaz. Yet, while they still used the rhetoric of homeopathy as a scientific medicine, the rhetoric that socially justified the existence of homeopathy changed dramatically. Wh ile in the Porfiriato homeopathic doctors argued that a medical school would reduce the amount of untrained homeopathic 87 See for instance, Lear, Workers, Neighbors, and Citizens: the Revolution in Mexico City . 296 practitioners, in the 1930s, homeopaths argued that their therapeutic approach fit the interest of a revolutionary government. Homeopath y, according to this argument, was a therapy suitable for the working class because homeopaths' services and homeopathic medicines were inexpensive and because most of its practitioners belong to a sector of the population who could hardly pay for an elite medical training such as ENM students. Consequently, supporters of homeopathy argued that the government would be aligning with the ideals of the revolution if it supported homeopathy; revolutionary medicine for a revolutionary government. Yet in contrast to the Porfiriato , the social democratic rhetoric did not work; at least not in the terms homeopaths wanted. The state was more interested in organizing a consistent legal and government structure that provided certainty to the regulation of public life, particularly the regulation of public health, rather than fulfilling the demands of working -class homeopathic practitioners. This policy worked out in the courts and left the regulatory framework, the sanitary code in particular, untouched, turning homeopa Epilogue and Conclusions The last and closing chapter of this dissertation shows that homeopaths' efforts to resist the sanitary dictatorship were unfruitful and ther efore suggests that homeopathy as a national working -class medical movement faded away. The sanitary dictatorship was effective in keeping the control of medical practice regulations in the hands of sanitary authorities. This did not imply that in practice homeopathy did not persist as a rhetorical tool to demand health and healing services and practical tool that delivered health and healing services to the working class, or that homeopathy was no longer offered as an option of medical training to the work ing class. Rather the opposite. For instance, j ust five months after the new sanitary code was issued in 1934, Miguel Hidalgo Salazar and Antonio Loyo, General Secretary and Secretar y of Social Action of the Confederation of Peasants \"Emiliano Zapata\" of P uebla, addressed President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas to request that homeopaths were not prosecuted . According to Salazar and Loyo, homeopaths were truly an efficacious social service, particularly for the disenfranchised sick people. [...] They are closer to the proletariat because most of them come from its ranks, paying for their education, and consequently they deserve the protection that [the Confederation] requests, giving the warrants they need to pursue they humanitarian labor. They contrasted homeopaths' humanitarian labor with that of \"allopaths\" who, they believed, were the ones who promoted the prosecution. They were the ones who look after their own personal \u2014 and not the collective interests \u2014 so Salazar and Loyo believed. \"If allopathic physicians understood the higher role they play in society, they would act accordingly and consequently would not interfere with homeopaths ['s undertakings]\", the leaders o f the confederation concluded.1 1 AHSS, SP, SJ, 29, 14. 298 This intervention shows that the idea that homeopathy was a medical system suitable for the working class, originally conceived in Mexico City in the context of the marginalizing policies of sanitary authorities and ENM fac ulty against the ELHM in the early 1920s, spread out to other urban centers beyond the capital city by the mid 1930s. This should not result as a surprise given that Puebla as Mexico City had a homeopathic medical school that offered medical training and w hose graduates confronted both local and federal sanitary authorities. Sanitary authorities might have retained the control over medical practice regulations and aimed to marginalize homeopathic practice, but by perceiving homeopaths as suitable for their needs, working class patients emphasized the need for regulations that incorporated rather than dismissed homeopathic practice. Hence, regardless of the regulatory control gained by sanitary authorities in the first half of the 1930s, in practice there was a medical marketplace both in Mexico City and other urban centers in Mexico such as Puebla that demanded the services of homeopaths. A different question is how influential such demands were in orienting public policies regarding the regulation of homeop athic training and practice in the 1930s. This question requires further research to evaluate the growth and regulation of homeopathic medical schools in urban centers beyond Mexico City. In other words, it is necessary to evaluate both homeopaths' efforts to create and sustain new and existing medical schools in other states such as Puebla and Jalisco, where homeopathic schools either existed or were being built, and understand how local state laws regarding professional medical practice evolved during the 1920s and 30s in response to the centralization of government during C\u00e1rdenas administration (1934 -40). On one side, the federal government did not have an immediate and straightforward response to demands such as Salazar's and Loyo's. As it happened with homeopaths' demands in 299 Mexico City in the late 1920s, the President handed over the Confederation of Peasants \"Emiliano Zapata\" of Puebla 's demand to the DSP. Moreover, if the DSP policies during the early 1930s are considered, it is unlikely that the san itary department ever took any actions to fulfill the Confederation's demands. On the other, the emergence of free homeopathic medical schools in other urban centers in Mexico, such as Guadalajara, took place at a historical moment when C\u00e1rdenas centralizi ng regime favored the reopening of the ENMH at the IPN rather than supported individual efforts such as ELHM's. These federal policies altogether with the professional competition that the opening of a new school implied made difficult and sometimes even h indered the efforts to open new homeopathic medical schools beyond Mexico City. For instance, On\u00e9simo R. G\u00f3mez struggled to create a free homeopathic medical school in Guadalajara, Jalisco due to economic conflicts with both other homeopaths who supported him in the project and other doctors who saw all homeopaths as competitors in the emerging medical market place in the capital of that state2. The fate of this school and other similar efforts such as the ELMP and the School of Homeopathic Medicine of Yuca t\u00e1n will illuminate how and if the process of state intervention worked in these states as it did in Mexico City. In Mexico City, the consolidation of state institutions during the C\u00e1rdenas administration threatened one more time to ban the ELHM in Mexico City. As I analyzed in chapter 3, L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas' government initiated a series of reforms with the SEP aimed to professionalize the working class that resulted in the creation of the National Polytechnic Institute in Mexico City. This institution incorp orated the ENMH, perhaps as a response to homeopaths' demands. Yet the recognition of homeopathy as an option of professional medical training to the working class by the state was accompanied by the latter's effort to centralize administration. This resul ted in a 2 This took place during the last three years of the 1920s. On\u00e9simo R. G\u00f3mez was an ELHM graduate. See \"Epistolario. Dr. Higino G. P\u00e9rez y On\u00e9simo R. G\u00f3mez\" in the Archive of Dr. Fernando D ar\u00edo Francois -Flores in Mexico City. 300 series of policies aimed to rule out competing homeopathic medical schools with a similar function. Just as the SCJN valued the coherence and unity of state institutions that protected the society over the rights of individuals whose actions confl icted with such institutions in lawsuits between homeopaths and the DSP, C\u00e1rdenas' government aimed to unify its government structure. Hence, the SEP initiated a campaign to close the ELHM once the Institute became a reality in the second half of the 1930s3. Based on the regulations that gave SEP authorities the right to extend or withdraw the authorization to grant medical degrees to professional schools that did not fulfill academic and/or other type of requirements, the SEP attempted to close the ELHM. I n a mobilization similar to the one organized in the 1920s, ELHM graduates were able to keep their medical school working, though the elementary and middle schools associated to it were closed. Apparently the logic was that if the state was funding the pro fessional training of homeopaths through the IPN, there were no apparent reasons to keep an independent medical school working. Yet the details of this conflict and its significance in the context of the changes that took place during C\u00e1rdenas' administrat ion remain to be researched and analyzed. The revolutionary state and its institutions inherited the ideological conflict between political and economic liberalism and positivism in the 19th century. This ideological conflict in the 20th century, which the Mexican historian Javier Garciadiego Dantan has identified as the struggle between \" rudos vs. cient\u00edficos \" or roughs and scientists, did not end up with the consolidation of the university as a revolutionary institution in the early 192 0s under Vasconcelos' lead4. Rather it continued throughout the 1920s and eventually resulted in the ideological, though not financial, excision of the university from state control. During the 1930s, 3 See lawsuits against the President and the Ministry of Public Education in 1939, 1940 and 1941 in the AHELHM. 4 See Javier Garciadiego Dantan, Rudos contra Universidad, 1996). 301 C\u00e1rdenas' educational reforms aimed to use, as in the Porfiriato , scientific education as a tool to modernize the nation. These reforms began with an amendment to article 3 of the Constitution to make socialism the educational philosophy endorsed by the state. Yet in C\u00e1rdenas' administration this meant that he aimed to subsume science to the social needs of the nation. Due to the conflicts between the Mexican state and the UNAM, C\u00e1rdenas policies were not undertaken by the latter, which continued training social elites in the 1920s though implementing Cardenas ' designed programs to socialize the elitist professionals, particularly physicians5. Rather, he created the Consejo Nacional de la Educaci\u00f3n Superior y la Investigaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica [National Board of Superior Education and Scientific Research] in 1936 to implement the policies on professional training and scientific research that the nation required6 and the Oficina Nacional de Control y Registro de Escuelas y Titulos Profesionales [National Office of Control and Registry of Professional Schools and Degrees ] in 1937 to supervise and regulate the granting of professional degrees.7 The SEP's role in this new structural organization was reduced to administer the largest vocational professional school during the C\u00e1rdenas' administration, the IPN. The effect of t hese policies in medical training and practice remain to be thoroughly researched. The evidence analyzed in this dissertation suggests that the three larger medical schools in Mexico City, the ENM, the ENMH, and the ENM, were the most important centers of medical training throughout the 1930s in the capital and would remain as such until 5 See for instance Gabriela Soto -Laveaga's work on the medical social service initiated during Gustavo Baz Prada's term as the UNAM's dean in Gabriela Soto Laveaga, \"Bringing the Revolution to Medical Schools: Social Service and a Rural Health Emphasis in 1 930s Mexico,\" Estudios Mexicanos/Mexican Studies L\u00f3pez, \"El Consejo Nacional de la Educaci\u00f3n Perfiles (2009). 7 See Moreno, Yankee Don't Go Home! : Mexican Nationalism, American Business Culture, and the Shaping of Modern Mexico, 1920 -1950 22-3. 302 the late 20th century when other private universities started to populate the institutional landscape. As throughout the period that I analyze in this dissertation, during C\u00e1rdenas' administration legislators did not agree to issue a piece of legislation that regulated article 3 of the Constitution and clearly establish which professions required their practitioners to have a degree in order to offer their services. The mobi lization of unions and professional associations was originally intended to push for this regulation, but facing the lack of response from the Congress, the executive created the National Office to regulate professional schools and degree granting. This of fice aligned with the original intention that led to the creation of National Board in terms of transferring to the state the responsibility to supervise and regulate professional training and schools, which originally laid in the UNAM. By creating this of fice, C\u00e1rdenas attended the demands of the liberal professionals who sought for mechanisms to regulate professional practice and the market of professional services, on one side, yet retained the control over the training institutions that produced such pr ofessionals perhaps preventing that the source of professionals was not determined by the market but by the state's perceived social needs, on the other. When the Congress passed the regulation of professions in 1943, the SEP was given full authority over the granting of professional degrees, though preventions remained that allowed practicing professionals \u2014 those who did not attend a professional school \u2014 to obtain licenses to practice their profession.8 During the Cardenas' administration, institutions that regulated professional training and licensing implemented programs that responded to the need to bring health to rural populations, such as the creation of the national social service for physicians and the IPN's school of rural 8 See Moreno, Yankee Don't Go Home! : Mexican Nationalism, American Business Culture, and the Shaping of Modern Mexico, 1920 -1950 24. 303 medicine.9 Similarly, the DSP created and administered, in coordination with other federal government institutions such as the Minister of Agriculture and local governments, the Unidades Sanitarias Ejidales [County C\u00e1rdenas admi nistration to provide comprehensive healthcare as part of a program to improve the socioeconomic conditions of rural populations.10 These units were county sanitary cooperatives where sanitary, agricultural and local authorities combined efforts to provide what is considered the first effort to combine preventative medicine with social welfare. Consequently, C\u00e1rdenas sanitary policy was combined with the distribution of land, the construction of infrastructure that brought pure water to rural towns, the educ ation of peasants and workers on sanitary matters, the creation of cooperatives to fund local and small sanitary insurance services, and similar endeavors. C\u00e1rdenas and the DSP's minister also promoted other projects to bring health services to the country side and particularly to rural populations such as a hospital in Torre\u00f3n, Coahuila, a center of rural hygiene in Santa Ana, Sonora, and the Autonomous Department of Matters of Indigenous People, under the supervision of the DSP, among others. These policie s ran along the creation of research institutions such as the Institute of Hygiene, the School of Public Health, and the Institute of Public Health and Tropical Diseases. All these policies and structural changes signaled the need to change the structure o f the DSP to respond to a new form of public health intervention, based in the delivery of health services altogether with public welfare. This change took place in 1943 when the DSP and the Office of Public Welfare were merged into the Secretar\u00eda de Asist encia Social [Ministry of Social Assistance].11 Soto Laveaga, \"Bringing the Revolution to Medical Schools: Social Service and a Rural Health Emphasis in 1930s Mexico.\" 10 For C\u00e1rdenas public health policies 5.2 (1998). 304 The struggle to bring the original demands of the revolution back to the people as state policies that actually reached both the disenfranchised in rural and urban settings and peasants and the working class, lasted two decades after the armed mobilizations ended in the late 1910s. During these decades, the Mexican state went through a transformation that established the institutions that would define Mexico in the second half of the 20th century. In the case o f health, the 1917 constitutional recognition of health as a state's responsibility initiated a new era in the delivery of Public Health and consequently of professional regulation in Mexico. It is not a coincidence that historian Ana Mar\u00eda Carrilo's analy sis of the consolidation of the healing professions concludes in 1910 and public health specialist Julio Frenk's historical analysis of the market of professional medical services starts in 1917.12 I agree with them that such an arbitrary delimitation is hi storigraphically convenient because it signals the end of the liberal state and the beginning of the welfare state in Mexico and consequently the ideology behind the professional organization of physicians, the institutions around which they organized them selves, and the relationship between these and the emergent state structure were significantly different. In other words, Carrillo sees 1910 as the end point where professional medical institutions consolidated as clearly different from those of the coloni al period, and Frenk acknowledges that in 1917 the structures that defined the Mexican medical profession during the 20th century began to consolidate. As with many other periodizations, this one holds only if we pay attention to differences rather than similarities, to ruptures rather than continuities. In this dissertation, I stepped back from assuming that the triumphant liberalism of the second half of the 20th century and the construction of the revolutionary state defined two drastically different f orms of professional 12 See Carrillo, \"Profesiones sanitarias y lu cha de poderes de M\u00e9xico 116.6 (1980). 305 organization of physicians. Rather, I considered how the revolutionary state used both professional and state structures consolidated at the turn of the 20th century to train and regulate physicians in the state's efforts to bring heal th to the population. The main structures that controlled the medical profession were not radically different. Indeed, by using the same structures that regulated the profession in Mexico City during the Porfiriato , and consequently either the same medical elites that ruled during this period, or their academic descendents, revolutionary governments only transferred the policies of professional regulation that were taking place in the capital to the rest of the nation. Consequently, the Superior Board of He alth transformed into the Department of Public Health and the National School of Medicine hosted by the National University of Mexico continued being the centers of professional control after 1917. The policies with which these institutions aimed to contr ol the profession were similar in both periods. The ENM's medical curriculum aimed to serve as model of training that warranted homogeneity in all medical schools and consequently of professional practice once students graduated. The DSP aimed to use such training as the legal basis to regulate professional practice by means of a medical registry, a list of practitioners authorized by the state to practice medicine or other sanitary professions. As it happened in the rest of Latin America, the diversity of healers and the plurality of the medical profession, as well as the threats that this heterogeneous population of practitioners represented to medical elites who wanted to marginalize their competitors, continued throughout the first half of the 20th centu ry in Mexico.13 Midwifes, spiritual healers, Mar\u00eda Carrillo and Cl audia Agostoni have analyzed the plurality of the Mexican medical profession in Carrillo, \"M\u00e9dicos del M\u00e9xico decimon\u00f3nico: entre el durante el Porfiriato.\" For the preoccupations of the medical profession regarding other forms of healing in the mid -20th century see Everardo and curanderos were all an important component of the large group of practitioners who offered healing services during the 19th century and that persisted throughout the first half of the 20th century, regardless of the efforts of the medical profession to monopolize the delivery of health care. 14 As other historians have shown for other Latin American countries, in Mexico the growth of a state apparatus to deal with public health matters a ll over the nation and which ENM graduates used to first control medical practice and later regulate medical training did not prevent traditional and other type of healers \u2014 or even physicians with approaches who opposed those endorsed by the ENM \u2014 from po pulating the Mexican medical marketplace. Homeopaths, their institutions, and their ambiguous position within the Mexican medical profession and within state institutions exemplify this trend. However, by emphasizing the continuities between the late 19th and the early 20th centuries I do not mean that the institutions that consolidated the Mexican medical profession did not change throughout this period. Highlighting the continuities within Mexican medical institutions and their changing relationship to th e revolutionary state allows me to show that the consolidation of the profession did not end in 1910 from whence it followed a progressive evolution towards the medical and state institutions that characterized the second half of the 20th century. Rather, the 1920s, 30s and early 40s were tortuous years where tradition and modernity, lay and specialized knowledge, liberalism and positivism, private and public welfare, and social 45.noviembre (1939). ; and Pruneda, \"La supercher\u00eda m\u00e9dica en el folklore.\" For Latinamerica see Palmer, From Popular Medicine to Medical Populism : Doctors, Healers, and Public Power in Costa Rica, 1800 - 1940 ., particularly chapters 4 -6; Sowell, The Tale of Healer Miguel Perdomo Neira: Medicine, Ideologies, and Power in the Nineteenth -Century Andes ., specially chapter 4. 14 Carrillo, \"Nacimiento Procuradur\u00eda Federal del Consumidor ; Editorial Pax M\u00e9xico, 1994). 307 elites and the working class intertwined, competed, and conciliated to accommod ate 19th century elitist medical institutions within a state structure that aimed to democratize professional medical training and practice. The elitist aspirations of ENM graduates, which the DSP employed to contain epidemic disease all over the nation, i ncluding the \"the fifth plague\" or the irregular practice of medicine in the 1920s, clashed with politicians and government officers who supported the popularization of the university and private efforts to offer professional training, a conflict that favo red homeopaths. In the 1930s, C\u00e1rdenas' social and economic policy and centralization of government subsumed ENM graduates' professional aspirations to the needs of the population; hence his call to \"socialize the professions\". In this process, the state s ustained its support to homeopathy. What does this persistent support to a medical system which most regular doctors regarded as unscientific tell us about the professional organization of physicians in Mexico? What does it tell us about the relationship of the state to the Mexican medical profession? What does it tell us about the social spaces conquered by biomedicine both in medical institutions and amongst the population in Mexico? What does it tell us about the institutionalization of public health in the formation of a post -revolutionary state? And finally what does it tell us about the contradictory state policies regarding the health of the population and the regulation of the profession at one time and the way in which these changed through time? H istorians of medicine have insisted that the framing of otherness in medical practice speaks more to the socio -political position of a particular group of medical practitioners rather than to a substantial difference between certain unorthodox medical syst ems with their own ontologies and the systems that grouped around positivistic medicine in the 19th century and later around what has been labeled 308 as biomedicine.15 For this reason, Charles Rosenberg says that \"Alternative medicine is [...] an index to the social and cultural geography of regular medicine\".16 In this vein I have attempted in this dissertation to step back from the theoretical discussions about the valid ity or not of homeopathy as an effective medical system. Rather I have paid attention to understanding how the characteristics of the system helped their practitioners deliver healing services in specific social settings and from there position themselves as professional competitors of regular doctors. In other words, what matters to me is how the experts' discussions about the nature of medical science and the competing medical systems such as homeopathy is an instantiation of larger social disputes regard ing practitioners' mobility in the social ladder, professional reputation, revenues that resulted from private or public professional practice, the allocation of state resources, among others. In this sense, the disputes between the regular profession and homeopaths in Mexico opened a window to explore the place of health in the broad Porfirian and post -revolutionary society, including patients, practitioners, and the state. Homeopathy's arrival and early development in 19th -century Mexico resembles the o ne it went through in England and the United States, where homeopathy though an unorthodox medical system was originally practice in the realm of regular medicine and was only later marginalized as medical deviance.17 In the latter countries, where politica l, economic and 15 See for instance the analysis of quackery as a social construction and the slippery definition of fringes between orthodox and unorthodox practitioners in 18th century Britain in Bynum and Porter, eds., Medical Fringe & Medical Orthodoxy, 1750 -1850 1-4. Roger Cooter questions the validity of the dichotomy created by regarding 19th-century heterodox medical practices as having alternative cosmologies. See Cooter , \"Alternative Medicine, Alternative Cosmology.\" 16 Charles E. Rosenberg, Our Present Complaint : American Medicine, Then and Now (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007) 130. 17 Perhaps the main monograph on the history of homeopathy in England wa s written by Nicholls, Homoeopathy and the Medical Profession . There are two authors who have extensively written about homeopathy in the United States, Kaufman, Homeopathy in America; the Rise and Fall of a Medical Heresy .; and Haller, The History of Amer ican Homeopathy: the Academic Years, 1820 -1935 ., Haller, The History of American Homeopathy: From Rational Medicine to Holistic Health Care . 309 consequently professional egalitarianism prevailed during the first half of the century, homeopathy was only another of the multiple healing systems that proliferated in this period and that both university -trained physicians and lay practi tioners used to satisfy patients and find a place in the competitive medical marketplace.18 But in contrast to practitioners of other healing systems of the period, homeopaths emulated the professional organization of university -trained physicians, establis hing medical schools, opening hospitals, creating professional societies, and publishing medical journals. Perceiving that their social authority was challenged, orthodox physicians reacted by formulating strict rules of allegiance, such as the 1858 Britis h Medical Act pushed by the British Medical Association and the exclusionary act of the American Medical Association, that aimed to monopolize training and practice under the direction of a single professional organization. While these measures hardly erad icated homeopathy from England and the U. S., they placed orthodox physicians on the right track to consolidate as a profession during the second half of the 19th and the early 20th century and marginalized other healing methods such as homeopathy. Simila rly, in Mexico, where liberalism and laissez faire predominated as political and economic philosophies, university physicians and sanitary authorities regarded doctors who practiced homeopathy as members of the profession as long as they had the appropriat e credentials and fulfilled the sanitary board's regulations. Amidst struggles and wars to make liberalism a national political and economic philosophy and federalism a form of government, Mexican physicians were also struggling to transform colonial medic al institutions that regulated their professional life into modern ones that fit a modern liberal republic. Consequently, subscribing to the state's regulatory institutions was more important to the medical community 18 For an example of such a diversity see Gevitz, Other Healers: Unorthodox Medicine in America .; Whorton, Nature Cures : the History of Alternative Medicine in America .; Bynum and Porter, eds., Medical Fringe & Medical Orthodoxy, 1750 -1850 .; and Bivins, Alternative Medicine? : a History . 310 than doctrinarian deviance, though the distinction of practicing homeopathy remained in place. When the political and social stability was achieved by the late 1870s and Porfirio D\u00edaz's brought social and political rest as well as economic progress to the nation for almost four decades, orthodo x physicians consolidated around state institutions, monopolizing the medical school, the sanitary board and welfare hospitals. Both orthodox physicians and homeopaths also established long -lasting professional societies and journals. Homeopaths' societies in Mexico were initially integrated by lay practitioners and university -trained physicians, but orthodox physicians' privileged positions helped them impose the university degree as the symbol of professional distinction and the requirement for employment at government institutions or for issuing official government documents such as death certificates. With the aim to fulfill the requirements to belong to the profession and participate of regulated public life, homeopathic physicians exscinded from the ho meopathic society and created their own. Mirroring the social stratification that the Porifiriato generated, the professional distinction between university - trained physicians and practitioners who either received some training at homeopathic societies or self-trained using manuals of domestic medicine established a hierarchy within the medical profession that eventually the Porfirian government institutionalized. In the face of a community of homeopathic physicians who promoted the scientific basis and sup eriority of homeopathy over its rivals, a healing system widely practiced by people who lacked adequate medical training, and a population that searched for the services of mostly irregular homeopathic practitioners, Porifrio D\u00edaz's government decided to s upport a homeopathic hospital and a school. The decision elevated homeopathy to the rank of a profession in Mexico, giving them institutions where they received medical training and practice their own healing system, as well as credentials to participate o f the privileges that their orthodox peers enjoyed. 311 The regularization of homeopathy during this period is ambiguous. It can be interpreted as a despotic decision typical of the Porfirian regime, particularly because it responded to the requests of homeop aths who had close ties with or had family bonds to economic elites, and to the interests of his ministry of the interior \u2014 and also Diaz's father -in-law \u2014 without consulting the school of medicine's faculty or members of the sanitary board. It can also be interpreted as an extension of the reforms to modernize and regulate Mexican institutions, including the medical profession. In this sense, homeopathy's regulation was an effort from the government elites to social elites. A third way to interpret this ou tcome is as a populist effort to provide medical training and healing services to the working class through welfare institutions. The model for the provision of health to the destitute shifted during the 19th century from mostly Catholic charity institutio ns to a state responsibility in the form of welfare.19 While not being a policy of primary interest, officials during the Porfiriato carried out a series of reforms to modernize welfare institutions to attend the medical, educational and labor needs of the poor. In this context, the creation of the homeopathic hospital and school appear as an effort of elite physicians to implement a healing system that to the standards of the late 19th century proved to be as or perhaps even more effective than regular ther apeutics. Given the nature of the large majority of homeopathic practitioners and the apparent high demand amidst the working class, homeopathy seemed a good target for Porifirean welfare reforms. The ambiguous nature to regulate homeopathic training and p ractice continued throughout the 1920s and 30s and played a key role in transforming and regulating the institutions of homeopathic training during this period. However, the nature of homeopathy as an option to offer medical training to the working class 19 Virginia Aguirre Arv\u00edzu, Isaac Garc\u00eda Venegas, A\u00edda Valero Ch\u00e1vez and Social E Trabajo, De la caridad a Social, 2002). ; Ann Shelby Blum, \"Conspicuous Benevolence: Liberalism, Pub lic Welfare, and Private Charity in Porfirian Mexico City, 1877 -1910,\" The Americas 58.1 (2001). 312 along with the social and political changes initiated by the armed mobilization of the 1910s in the whole nation, and particularly in urban centers such as Mexico City and Puebla, fueled the political activism of the lower ranks of the profession who having limited access to elite medical schools actively protested for the recognition of the schools \u2014 most of them homeopathic \u2014 where they studied. The institutionalization of Mexican homeopathy seems to be exceptional only if contrasted specifically to the f ormation of the medical profession in industrialized countries such as England and the U.S. and in other Latin American nations. In the first case, Mexican homeopathy achieved what English and American homeopaths could not. Rather than being marginalized b y the orthodox medical profession, Mexican homeopaths received state support and placed themselves vis -\u00e0-vis the orthodox Mexican medical profession, as elite physicians with a state funded school and hospital and most importantly with a degree that acknow ledged the regular status. Latin American nations, in the second case, developed strong medical professions by the end of the 19th century and homeopathy took hold through literate patients, pharmacists and physicians.20 However, the efforts of homeopaths i n other Latin American nations to assault the medical profession were not successful. Steven Palmer's analysis of homeopathy in Costa Rica suggests that the cause lies in a late arrival of homeopathy to this country combined with an already developed profe ssion.21 And Sowell's analysis of healer Miguel Perdomo Neira suggests that the close association between orthodox physicians and the 20 For analyses on the development on the medical profession in Latin American countries see Palmer, From Popular Medicine to Medical Populism : Doctors, Healers, and Public Power in Costa Rica, 1800 - 1940 .; Sowell, The Tale of Healer Miguel Perdomo Neira: Medicine, Ideologies, and Power in the Nineteenth -Century Andes .; Zulawski, Unequal Cures: Public Health and Political Change in Bolivia, 1900 -1950 ., part icularly chapters 1 and 2; Emilio Quevedo and Francisco Guti\u00e9rrez, \"Scientific Medicine and Public Health in Nineteenth -century Latin America,\" Science in Latin America. A History , ed.

Mexican homeopathy appears less distinct if the role that homeopathy played in giving voice to the demands of marginalized groups whether within the profession or in particular national settings is considered. In this case, the relevance of homeopathy as a medical system that accommodated the health needs of the marginalized, of i ts institutions as suitable to bring medical training and consequently social mobility to the working class, and the politics associated to its practice as means to resist those in power appear to be the same across countries. For instance, while in the U. S. orthodox physicians imposed clear gendered roles within the profession, which in turn impacted on women's professional and personal lives, homeopathy's irregular status allowed women's free expression of their political activism (usually in relation to feminism, suffrage, dress codes and health reform) in the mid -19th century and blurred the gender distinction that disqualified their entrance to the orthodox medical profession.23 By the end of the century, the incorporation of women to homeopathy helped to \"recast the physician from a medically educated male to a practitioner of either sex, shifting debates away from gender toward proper education and practice.\"24 In colonial India, homeopathy was adopted by lay practitioners and physicians because its dis tribution as a modern medical commodity fit the needs of an emerging class of \" bhadralok (or 'respectable people')\"; its charitable institutions 22 See Sowell, The Tale of Healer Miguel Perdomo Neira: Medicine, Ideologies, and Power in the Nineteenth -Century Andes 48-50.; for Argentina s ee Mg. Manuel A. Korzeniewski, y Tecnolog\u00eda XX.38, mayo (2009). 23 For the role of gender in American medicine see Regina Markell Morantz -Sanchez, Sympathy and Science: Women Physicians in American Medicine (New York: Oxford University Press, 1985). For the role of gender in American homeopathy see Kirschmann, A Vital Force: Women in American Homeopathy . 24 Kirschmann, A Vital Force: Women in American Homeopathy 75. 314 were modern yet not imperial; it allowed local physicians to participate of a Western scientific medical system that was not associated with imperial medicine; and its theoretical foundations did not oppose traditional Indian medical beliefs.25 In Latin American countries where the medical profession could hardly attend the health needs of the urban population, let alone the rural countryside, and the state saw the need to grant medical licenses to practitioners who lacked a proper medical training, homeopathy persisted as a therapeutic option used by families, entrepreneurs like Professor Carbell in Costa Rica who c ombined unorthodox medical systems with displays that mimicked those of scientifically trained physicians both of which resulted so attractive to patients, and by physicians who convinced of the effectiveness of homeopathy opened hospitals and schools whos e graduates were frequently licensed by the state to respond to the demands of health of Latin American populations.26 How did homeopathy overturn the role of non -elite physicians in the organization of the medical profession in Mexico? The nature of homeo pathy as a symptom -based healing system that uses harmless medications made and continues making it suitable to be used by a population with minimal or no training in medical science. In the 19th century, when orthodox physicians were using specialized sci entific medical knowledge as a means to detach from other healing practices, gain authority over patients, and uplift the profession, the commercialization of homeopathy as a scientific healing system that any literate citizen could use and more importantl y practice threatened the monopolistic efforts of orthodox physicians. However, homeopathy was not for everyone. Only literate citizens had access to it. In Mexico where elites constituted a minority who were literate not only in Spanish but sometimes also in French and 25 Bivins, Alternative Medicine? : a History 152-8. 26 See Palmer, From Popular Medicine to Medical Populism : Doctors, Healers, and Public Power in Costa Rica, 1800 -1940 185-91.; Sowell, The Tale of Healer Miguel Perdomo Neira: Medicine, Ideologies, and Power in the Nineteenth -Century Andes 57-8. 315 increasingly in the 19th century in English and the mostly illiterate indigenous population constituted the large majority, this implied that homeopathy could only be learned and practiced by elites. With the growth that the working class ex perienced during the Porfiriato particularly in urban centers and the incipient but to offer basic and vocational training to workers through welfare institutions, this trend started to change at the turn of the century. Some physicians as well as lawyers, teachers, and pharmaceutical entrepreneurs, to mention just a few among the emergent working class, started to practice homeopathy and organize their professional societies. But the state enforcement of measures aimed to regulate medical training and prac tice obliged homeopaths to divide their societies according to the nature of the practitioners who integrated them, in other words into societies of homeopathic doctors and lay practitioners, perpetuating the social divide between elites and the working cl ass, professional physicians and lay practitioners, medical doctors and charlatans. It was this division the one that allowed homeopathic physicians to obtain the state support to open a hospital that eventually hosted a homeopathic medical school. Rather than ruling out the competitors of the orthodox medical profession, the state intervention embraced homeopathy as a need to bring professional homeopaths to the large number of patients who demanded their services but could mostly find untrained practition ers. In other words, the response of the Mexican state to the pluralism within the profession symbolized by homeopathy and to the popular demands of such pluralism was to institutionalize such diversity by regularizing homeopathy.27 This solution was ambivalent. In the short turn, the state supported homeopathic medical school did not fulfill the purpose for which it was opened because only social elites had access to 27 For an analysis of how different forms of state intervention influence the outcome in the professionalization of physicians in Mexico in contrast to industrializ ed nations such as the US and England see Nigenda and Solorzano, \"Doctors and Corporatist Politics: the Case of the Mexican Medical Profession.\" 316 it through the 1920s, leaving space for others, mainly medical entr epreneurs in the 1910s and 20s and eventually the state, to solve the problem of offering medical training to the working class. In the long run, the efforts to centralize government during the 1930s in an effort to fulfill the demands of the revolution re sumed the project of a state -sponsored homeopathic school that brought medical training to the working class. The reconstruction of the Mexican state in response to the social demands of the revolution in the 1920s and 30s was not an easy task and resulted in the reformulation of the conflict between the mainstream medical profession and homeopaths. On one side, governments after the armed mobilizations of the 1910s confirmed the former hegemonic position of most of the Porfirian institutions within the new bureaucratic organization, including the ones that the medical profession controlled, such as the ENM and the new DSP. This could not be otherwise since revolutionary governments could not organize a nation from scratch. On the other, reformers such as Jo s\u00e9 Vasconcelos in the 1920s and L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas in the 1930s, both of whom had an educational agenda that contrasted with the one endorsed by elite professionals, struggled to transform state institutions to bring education to the population at large, into institutions that educated not only those who had the means to afford education but to all the nation. Their policies resulted in the eventual detachment of the national university as a state institution and the creation of a polytechnic institute and oth er structures to regulate professional training and licensing. Both structural changes, in turn, used homeopathic medical schools as options to provide medical training to the working class. As in the case of women in American homeopathy, in Mexico the in ternal division between progressive and traditional homeopaths, distinguished by their willingness or not to incorporate scientific breakthroughs into their corpus and adopt modern medical technologies, 317 overlapped over class and professional distinctions.28 Regardless of state support whether during the Porfiriato or in the 1920s, the homeopathic school did not thrive during these decades, perhaps because elites preferred to enroll at the ENM than at the ENMH as a consequence of the status of homeopathy as m arginal within the Mexican medical profession, because class schedules did not fit the needs of the population to whom originally this medical training was addressed, or because the support to the school ended once its original sponsor died. Moreover, elite homeopathic physicians who headed or taught at the ENMH did not strive to attract a larger pool of students to the school or make the later endure in front of the attacks of university physicians. While there were attempts to improve the material conditi ons of the school, the social and professional position of these homeopaths made them prone to seek state support without questioning its decisions. This attitude helped them subsist as a small and marginalized group of regular homeopathic physicians in th e 1900 and 10s. However, amongst these, those who endorsed traditional/orthodox/pure homeopathy found venues to offer medical training to the working class at the margins of state regulations through proprietary \u2014 or free, as they were labeled in the Mexic an context \u2014 medical schools. Aligning with the ethos of political organization that the working class experienced after the violent years of the 1910s in Mexico City, graduates from these schools in general, but particularly form the ELHM, used homeopathy as an ideology and their school as their headquarters to resist the efforts of the medical 28 Anne Taylor Kirschman identifies that classic/traditionalist homeopaths usually used high potencies were supp orted by lay practitioners, were more sectarian, endorsed vitalism, had a tendency to use metaphysical explanations of disease and more importantly were the responsible for the survival of homeopathy in the 20th century. See Kirschmann, A Vital Force: Women in American Homeopathy ., particular chapter 1. For the survival of homeopathy as a system that largely relied on metaphysical explanations of disease see Haller, The History of American Homeopathy: From Rational Medicine to Holistic He alth Care . 318 profession which used the DSP and the new sanitary regulation to ban the irregular practice of medicine all over the nation, in general, and of these schools and th eir graduates, in particular.29 Nigenda and Sol\u00f3rzano argue that the corporatist nature of the Mexican state modeled the national medical profession.30 Broadly considered, my dissertation suggests that the institutionalization of homeopathy is one example o f how state policies defined the organization of the Mexican medical profession, decentralizing professional power and redistributing it amongst different groups within the profession, such as homeopaths. However, my dissertation shows that the way to the hegemonic state control over the medical profession was not a straightforward process and that homeopaths were a key group used by the state to undermine university physicians' political control. While mentioning the role of university -trained physicians i n the new DSP, Nigenda and Sol\u00f3rzano disregarded their role in using their new position within this office and the UNM to unify medical training and practice across the nation. My dissertation shows that the disputes between the Mexican state and medical p rofession about the control of medical training and licensing took place between the institutions governed by university -trained physicians and the SEP, controlled by revolutionary governments. In this contested negotiation of political and professional po wer the state used homeopathic medical schools as a counterbalancing element within the medical profession. By supporting these schools, the state symbolically and economically undermined the privileged position of university physicians, and by retaining t he control over professional medical training beyond 29 For the political organization of the working class in Mexico City see Lear, Workers, Neighbors, and Citizens: the Revolution in Mexico City . 30 In other words, that the way the state organized its health policies that in turn defined academic curricula in and budget for medical schools, the organization of professional associations around political parties, the approach to medical practice, and the creation of public health institutions. Nigenda and Solorzano, \"Doctors and Corporatist Politics: the Case of the Mexican Medical Profession,\" 76 -80. For a similar analysis of the role of the state in the development of professional organization in Mexico see Cleaves, Professions and the State: the Mexican Case . 319 UNAM and over medical licensing, the state shared the control of professional medical training during the period of liberal medicine in Mexico.31 The organization of the Mexican medical working class around homeopathy developed as a form of resistance to sanitary measures that aimed to regulate medical degrees and licenses. The ambivalent role of the state is evident through the analysis of such resistance. On one level, the state aimed to impose publi c health measures all over the nation to fulfill the constitutional mandate to make health a priority amongst the population. By framing the liberal practice of medicine in general, and homeopathy and its practitioners in particular, as the fifth plague, a n epidemic disease which was necessary to attack, university physicians aligned with the state's public health policies. Consequently, the President in turn usually supported actions taken by sanitary authorities to implement and even enforce the medical r egistry and homeopaths' resistance rarely had any impact on these regulations, which aimed to ban homeopaths' training and practice. However, homeopaths' demands resonated with the state's educational policies. It was through theses and the institutions re sponsible to regulate implement them that the state supported homeopathy, as a currency of exchange in the state's struggle to control the medical profession. In this sense, the effectiveness of homeopathic resistance was subjected to the needs of the stat e, leaving them almost no space for political action. Such political exchanges and dynamics settle down the professional structures that characterized the homeopathic profession throughout the second half of the 20th century. 31 While Nigenda and Sol\u00f3rzano identify the liberal period from 1917 to 1944, I would argue with Hale that the ideologies behind the regulations, as well as the government institutions responsible to implement them, of the medical profession, were initiated in the mid -19th century, initially imp lemented during the Porfiriato , interrupted by the armed conflict of the 1910s and reformulated during the 1920s and 30s. Only in the 1940s onwards, it is possible to identify a stable structural organization of the medical profession and health services t hat distinguished Mexican medicine during the second half of the 20th century. Hale, The Transformation of Liberalism in Late Nineteenth -Century Mexico . 320 The chapter structure of the dissertation suggests that homeopathy was introduced in the mid-19th century, institutionalized in the Porfiriato , and controlled by sanitary authorities in the early 1930s, as if homeopathy's historical development within medical institutions in Mexico followed a normal pattern, flourishing during the late 19th century and fading out during the early 20th century with the triumph of biomedicine. This pattern for the development of homeopathy has been described for other countries such as England and the Un ited States. In contrast to these countries, homeopathy flourished during the second half of the 19th century in Mexico, became a regular profession at the turn of the century, and persisted as an important political component in the structuring of the med ical profession throughout the first four decades of the 20th century. Why were homeopaths able to defend and sustain such a position within the medical profession in Mexico when their professional peers could not in other countries? The answer lies in homeopaths' ability as a group of medical practitioners to navigate the elusive boundary between professional and domestic medicine, between regulated and unregulated medical practice, and the role of the state in the configuration of the Mexican medical prof ession. Particularly, homeopathy thrived as a parallel medical system during 20th century Mexico for several reasons.32 First, homeopathy's doctrinarian corpus was flexible enough to accommodate new ways of understanding medical science while preserving its particular understandings of the body and therapeutics. Mexican homeopathic physicians and domestic healers embraced homeopathy 32 Clauding Herzlich argues that the approach to study medical systems and forms of healing that differ from biomedicine as alternative medicine is misleading, particularly in countries where such systems have been historically present such as in France. She proposes the conceptualization of these practices as \"m\u00e9dicines paralleles\" whose \"constant distance\" with mainstream medicine varies through time and in response to social, political, cultural and economic factors. Claudine Herzlich, \"Patients, Practitioners, Social Scientists and the Multiple Logics of Caring and Healing,\" Historical Aspects of Unconventional Medicine. Approaches, Conceptas, Case Studies , eds. Robert J\u00fctte, Motzi Ekl\u00f6f and Marie C. Nelson (Sheffield, UK: European Association for the History of Medicine and Health, 2001). 321 because it aligned with their own particular understandings of health, disease and medicine whether be it modern/scientific or traditional/domestic. Following the regulatory policies that characterized the medical profession but responding to th e social needs of the urban working class, homeopathic physicians opened medical schools where they offered an up -to-date medical curriculum to train urban domestic healers. Second, responding to the social sensibilities and the structural changes that too k place after 1917, homeopaths used their medical schools as centers of political and professional organization and homeopathy as an ideology that congregated the medical working class. With this professional and labor identity, homeopaths resisted univers ity physicians' educational and sanitary regulatory policies aimed to ban homeopathic medical degrees and licenses. And third, responding to the social demands that resulted from the revolution, the Mexican state persistently supported homeopathic medical schools as a means to fulfill the demands of the working class for professional medical training, undermine the power of university physicians and retain the control of the medical profession. 322 Acronyms used in the m ain text and notes Institutions IHM Instituto Homeop\u00e1tico Mexicano SA San \u00c1ngel A Ayuntamiento Bibliography Published Primary Sources La reforma acta de la sesi\u00f3n del 16 de noviembre de 1881.
