DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES Nutrition and Wellness Coaching- We focus on a Holistic approach to Health and offer guidance and inspiration to help clients shift their behavior to healthier habits with nutrition, relationships, physical activity, career, and spirituality. Instead of prescribing a \"one diet fits all or one way of exercising\" to our clients, we instead focus on teaching our clients to observe their own unique responses to various modifications and how to choose health-promoting behaviors that work for them. We offer Private one-on-one coaching sessions where we meet once every two weeks and make only 2-3 changes at a time over a two-week period. Making changes in this way will help you to commit to the changes and incorporate them into your lifestyle more easily. Our Nutrition and Wellness coach is Jennifer Ratza. She is Board Certified with the Institute of Integrative Nutrition and has over 15 years of experience in the health care field as a Registered Nurse, Nationally Certified Medical Assistant, Chiropractic Assistant, and Biofeedback Coach.

Group sessions and workshops are also available. Psychic Readings- Looking for a little guidance with your love life, career, finances, health, or family? Many clients come to me when then need some direction in their life. Often times the answers lie within us, and our Guides are trying to tell us things on a daily basis. When I'm doing my psychic readings, I am connecting with your Guides and asking for clarification and guidance to help you meet your goals and understand what is happening in your life. I always set an intention for the information to come through that is for the Greatest Good of the Universe and have helped hundreds of clients over the last several years. I currently offer Past Life Readings, Crystal Ball Readings, and Oracle Card Readings. Readings vary with length of session. Psychic Development Lessons - We are All born with psychic abilities. It isn't just a few people... ALL people have the \"6th sense\". It is a powerful gift from God, and we all have access to learning how to develop it better within ourselves. With practice comes more confidence and trust in your psychic intuition, dreams, visions, feelings, and thoughts. The most common psychic abilities are clairvoyance (seeing clearly), clairaudience (hearing clearing), Clairsentience (feeling clearly), claircognizance (knowing clearly), clairgustance (tasting clearly), clairessence (ability to smell clearly), psychometry (ability to psychically collect information from an object), empathy and intuition. Just like any other skill or ability, it is something that we need to develop in order to know how to use it and in order to trust our own abilities when we are using them. We offer one-one-one private lessons for developing psychic abilities and a deeper connection to one's own Spiritual Guides and Intuition. Other possible topics the clients may want to learn about include (but are not limited to) psychic protection, grounding, deep breathing, spiritual ethics, and The Law Of Attraction/ The Laws of Nature. These lessons are available in person, and via skype. Group classes and series also available. Biofeedback and Meditation Coaching - Do you want to learn how to be more relaxed, focused, and in the present just by changing the way that you breathe? Ideally when meditating, your brain waves will be in an alpha state or in an alpha-theta state. Being in an alpha or alpha theta state allows you to be in a deeper meditative state, so that you can create new neural pathways in your brain and energy connections in the cells in your body. Learning how to put yourself into a self-hypnotic state allows you to tap into the subtle energies of your body and the Universe so that you can heal from past traumas and present challenges. Life is all about vibration and energy, and the words we speak and the thoughts we think create a vibration in the cells and the DNA in our cells. These lessons are all about BREATH EMPOWERMENT and teaching you how to strengthen your ability to take more control of your life. We cannot change the past, we cannot change other people; but we can change how we feel and what we think in the present moment. The present moment is the POINT OF POWER. When in a meditative state, you can literally reprogram the way that you FEEL about things that have happened in your past and are happening in your present. Having control over your thoughts and the way that you feel helps you to TAKE YOUR POWER BACK and to live in the present moment. When practicing deep abdominal breathing correctly, physiologically speaking, it helps you to balance your autonomic nervous system so that it is not in sympathetic nervous system response (Fight or Flight). Many people live from day to day in a fight or flight response without realizing it, and this can lead to chronic stress which can create serious health issues if not addressed. Deep breathing has numerous health benefits, including decreasing inflammation in the body, decreasing heart rate and blood pressure, increasing blood circulation and oxygen circulation, and releasing the \"feel good\" endorphins. These lessons will help you to learn different deep breathing techniques and meditation visualizations, as well as helping you to strengthen your diaphragm and ability to deep breathe throughout the day. These lessons are perfect for someone who is just beginning to get into meditation and wants to learn how to actively breathe and use the Law of Attraction to live as your EMPOWERED SELF. Lessons available in person and via Skype. Group workshops and series classes available. Spiritual Growth and Coaching Sessions -Are you looking for direction and inspiration in your spiritual life? These sessions are designed to help you on your spiritual path and are individually tailored to your own spiritual goals and your individual path in life. The sessions teach you how to connect with your Empowering Breathe, meditation, and the Inner Light within yourself. They are designed to help you discover your deeper purpose in life, reconnect to the Earth and Nature, heal from phobias and compulsions that may be keeping you off your path, and learn to live in a heart-centered way of being. Possibly teachings may include (but are not limited to) various meditation techniques, bioenergetics and chakra healing, using spiritual tools during mediation, learning to connect to the energies in nature for empowerment, connecting to the esoteric messages in day to day living, nourishing the body and Soul with natural energies of food, changing your thought patterns and energy holding patterns, movement therapy, emotional release therapy, toning, psychic development, visualization techniques, and grounding techniques. My biggest goal in this session is to inspire, educate, and empower you spiritually, mentally, emotionally, and physically. Lessons available in person or via phone or Skype. Group workshops and series classes available. Pendulum Reiki Healing Session -Reiki is a form of energy healing that is excellent for promoting relaxation and health. The body has the ability to heal itself, and in order to do so, complete relaxation is very beneficial. Stress, trauma and illness restrict the natural flow of \"chi\" (life force energy) through the body. By restoring chi to the body, Reiki rejuvenates the body's ability to relax and de-stress. Reiki is theorized to actually change the frequency of your body's cells and DNA. It works on a subtle/emotional level to help change the emotions and subconscious beliefs that might be contributing to any health issues you may be experiencing. It does not replace any current therapies or treatments a client is receiving from medical practitioners but is rather a complementary therapy that helps to promote healing. In addition to the practitioner radiating the Reiki energy through their hands, sessions may involve the practitioners sweeping their hands above the body in various ways, using crystals, or incorporating breath, vocal tones or sound therapy to break up energy blocks. I am certified as an ICRT Reiki 1 and 2 Practitioner. I was also attuned to Reiki-Seichim from a Reiki Master in Austin TX. In this session, the pendulum is an extension of the reiki energy coming from the practitioner's hands and is used to help read the chakras, open and cleanse the chakras, and help the energy in the body to be more balanced. 1-hour-long sessions are available in the studio only. Akashic Records Reading and Healing- The word Akasha is a Sanskrit word meaning \"space, sky, or ether\". The Akashic Records are the Records of everything that has happened in this life and in every past life. It is a Record of every thought and action you have taken, and also every alternative action or thought that you didn't take. It is a Record of your Soul in the past, present, and future is also known as the \"Book of Life\". According to quantum physics, everything is all happening RIGHT NOW. The AKASHIC RECORDS KEEPERS have a different concept of time then we do as humans. When we enter your Records, I work with you Masters, Teachers, and Loved Ones to bring forth any information that we are meant to know. I can also work with your Masters, Teachers, and Loved Ones to hold space for healing you on a Quantum Level while your Records are open. Some clients come to me for an Akashic Records Session in order to learn more about past lives, karmic completion in this life, chronic medical aliments in which no one is able to find the origin or cause, and to help with healing from phobias. For your session, you can choose to either have an Akashic Records Healing Session or an Akashic Records Reading. Healing Sessions are only available in person, but readings are available in person and via phone or Skype.

They are placed on your chakras and anywhere else your body may need healing. I then perform Reiki while the crystals are cleansing, opening, and balancing all of your chakras. 1-hour-long sessions are available in the studio only. HERE IS MY SHORT BIO Hello!! My name is Jennifer, and I'm the owner of Soul Zen Healing. I created it in 2013 so that I could help to educate and inspire people to be healthy, use various healing arts and modalities to promote healing and relaxation, and provide psychic readings to clients for personal growth and guidance. I am a Board-Certified Wellness Coach through the Institute of Integrative Nutrition, a Registered Nurse in the State of Florida, a Nationally Certified Medical Assistant, Certified Reiki Practitioner, Certified Akashic Records Reader, Intuitive Healer, and Psychic Medium. I began my medical/healthcare training in August of 2002 at the age of 17, after having a calling from God to become a Nurse. I became a Nationally Certified Medical Assistant in the summer of 2003 and worked as an NCMA while going to college for my RN. I graduated and became a Registered Nurse in 2008. I worked in the hospital setting for 2 \u00bd years, and soon realized that I wanted to pursue Natural Medicine and Energy Healing to help keep people out of the hospital by using a more Holistic approach. In 2012 I moved from my hometown in Florida to Austin Texas to live on a permaculture farm for 4 months and study Natural Medicine. From 2011 - 2018, I worked in various Integrative clinics and offices with various roles including Chelation Therapy Nurse, Chiropractic Assistant Office Manager, Neuro- Biofeedback Coach, Herbs and Supplement Specialist, and Apothecary Herbalist. In May 2016 I graduated from the Institute of Integrative Nutrition to become a Board-Certified Nutrition and Wellness Coach. Learning how to develop and trust my own psychic abilities is one of the very best things that has ever happened in my life. I have a huge passion for helping others to connect with their spirituality and psychic abilities, and I have had quite the journey in my spiritual and psychic development. Human beings are all psychic. We all have the 6th sense... it is a gift given to us by God and we can learn to enhance, develop and trust our own abilities. We can learn to listen to that voice within us, our feelings, and our visions and dreams; and learn how to use these gifts in order to improve our life and the lives of those around us. Here is the story of my journey to developing my psychic abilities. In 2010, I began studying the Law of Attraction, The Natural Law, bioenergetics (psychology of the Chakra system), and Yoga. I began studying with various mentors who taught me how to harness my psychic abilities as a Psychic Medium. In July of 2011 I received my first Reiki Level 1 attunement, and with that attunement I was able to further develop my psychic abilities. Two months later, I became an ICRT certified Reiki 1 and 2 Practitioner. I later became attuned to Reiki-Seichim from a Reiki Master in Austin TX. In 2013 I became a Certified Akashic Records Reader and Healer and also became Certified in Doterra's Aromatouch Technique. Aside from my specific certifications, I am self-taught in various aspects of spirituality, including Native American Spirituality, Tantric Arts, Toltec Spirituality, and Animal and Plant Medicine. n 2013, Soul Zen Healing was formed, and I have helped hundreds of clients in their spiritual journey with my healing sessions, group workshops, and private lessons. Wherever you are at in your spiritual journey, I am here to help support you with living your dreams and learning to live in contentment right here in the PRESENT MOMENT. Find Love and Medicine in everything you do, everything you breathe, and everything you think and feel. "}
