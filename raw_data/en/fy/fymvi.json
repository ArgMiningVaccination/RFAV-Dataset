Over time, excess skin, sebum and product residues build up on the scalp, suffocating it and - eventually - weakening the hair and irritating the skin. To restore the scalp to its optimum condition, a scalp detox is necessary. Much like caring for our farms, periodically, we must purify and strengthen the soil to restore harmony and balance - the scalp is no different. At the heart of this treatment is our Oway Herbs & Clay Peeling Cleanser. Comprised of 100% raw Biodynamic Savory Leaves, Horsetail Stems, Fair Trade Amazonian Pink Clay Salts and Soap Nuts, these powerful medicinal plants eliminate toxins, impurities and revitalize the scalp's delicate eco-system. To increase effectiveness, we recommend offering customizable treatments in conjunction with the lunar phases. Each treatment type contains an Oway Antioxidant Essential Oil Blend for a transformative, aromatherapeutic experience. Included is Oway's Plant & Mineral Refresh - our 100% organic, 4-in-1 dry shampoo, texturizer, deodorizer and scalp treatment that helps clients maintain a healthy scalp at home! This kit also arrives with a fully stocked Oway Plant & Mineral Refresh Retail Kit, complete with wood display and consumer brochures for client education.
