HOW DO HOMEOPATHIC REMEDIES WORK? How should I take my homeopathic medication? We recommend that you take your medication when there are no strong flavors in the mouth\u2014at least 15 minutes away from food or drink before and after taking the medication. Avoid handling the medication as much as possible, putting it in your mouth directly from the envelope or the bottle cap. How often should I take my homeopathic medicine? Some medicines are intended to be taken just once or a few times, and others are taken daily for a period of time. Often daily dosing is used for patients who are taking allopathic medicines at the same time. As with any prescription, homeopathic medicines are to be taken as prescribed by your doctor. What is an aggravation? An aggravation is a strong reaction to a homeopathic medication. Typical aggravations intensify current symptoms for a short period of time, typically 24 hours to 10 days. This is usually a good indication that healing is taking place. Why is an aggravation good for me? Suppressed symptoms go deeper into the body, ultimately resulting in worse disease later on. Healing with homeopathic medicine requires that suppressed symptoms be briefly expressed, allowing freedom to move toward a higher state of wellness. Are homeopathic medications toxic? No. Homeopathic medications are made from diluted and agitated plant, mineral, and animal substances. They are regulated by the FDA and are considered non-toxic. Do homeopathic medicines have side effects? Side effects are simply unwanted effects of a biochemical drug. Homeopathic medicines do not have side effects, but can produce aggravations. Are there things I should avoid while on medication? We recommend that patients avoid coffee, essential oils, and other substances that produce a strong response in the individual. These substances can antidote or affect the action of the medication. Can I see my medical doctor while under homeopathic care? Yes. All our doctors are licensed primary care physicians in the state of Washington. For some patients we provide specialty care as an adjunct to routine medical treatment, and for others we provide general care, referring to specialists as appropriate. It is up to the individual or the family to decide how they would like to assemble the medical team right for them. CAN I USE SUPPLEMENTS? Does it matter where I get my supplements? Use of high quality supplements is essential to assure their safety and efficacy. Unlike in some countries, the U.S. FDA does not regulate the supplement industry the way it does for homeopathic and allopathic medicines. Washington Homeopathic Clinic only offers supplements from companies which batch test for active ingredients and verify the absence of harmful contaminants. This QA process is costly for supplement companies, and it explains in part the higher price for their products. WHAT ABOUT VACCINES? Do you offer vaccines? No, we do not stock vaccines. We do carry some homeopathic remedies made from vaccines. "}
