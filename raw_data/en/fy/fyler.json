Perform a Visualization Meditation Visualization meditation can be an excellent practice during a spiritual detox. It involves using imagery to help your physical and mental health. This type of meditation is similar to others. You want to keep a straight spine, whether standing, sitting, or lying down. The most important step is keeping positive imagery in your mind while controlling your breath. You can imagine inhaling and exhaling with a flower opening and closing or picturing breathing in rays of light. You can also visualize areas of your body where you may be holding stress. Focus on releasing the tension and welcoming calmness and serenity. You can also practice mindfulness or recite mantras.

You can start a daily journal or write a letter to someone that has caused you pain. You don't have to send the letter to this person if you don't want to, but it can help you let go of resentment and negative feelings. Writing down your thoughts and feelings is about letting them out so they can't weigh you down. Read over your journal or letters and seek understanding. Think about how you can move forward despite painful or unpleasant memories. Do a Digital Detox Consider making a digital detox a part of your spiritual detox. It can be hard in this day and age to step away from your devices. However, they can become an addiction and cause stress.

Another 43% reported checking their messages, emails, and social media accounts non-stop. You can feel the physical effects when constantly looking at a screen. You may experience neck pain, elevated blood pressure, and eye strain. Try limiting your screen time and only use it when necessary. Avoid scrolling mindlessly for hours, wasting the day away, or staying up too late. Use that time to reflect and unwind. Read a book instead, or spend more time meditating and protecting your energy.
