When you think of [self-care](https://www.swiftfit.net/blog/daily-self-care-checklist), what is the first thing that comes to mind? If it was beauty rituals, you wouldn't be alone. The media tends to portray self-maintenance as the optimal [self-care](https://www.swiftfit.net/blog/winter-self-care-ideas) luxury\u2014even above relaxation. Yet, the real beauty of self-care lies within its many approaches to individual healing. This is why the spiritual medicine of healing crystals has thrived since its inception in the ancient Eastern societies in India and China. Crystals are one of the oldest forms of [self-care](https://www.swiftfit.net/blog/daily-mantras-to-add-into-your-weekly-self-care-routine). Thankfully, you do not have to practice any certain beliefs to reap the benefits of crystals. Anyone of any culture and religion can embrace their healing properties without going against their pre-existing beliefs. This sort of neutrality explains why crystals can now often be found in public spaces, like gas stations. However, the purest crystals are still most likely to be found in spiritual shops. There are at least 4,000 crystals in this world and each carries within it unique properties, including inner healing capabilities. If you have been searching for ways to expand or strengthen your self-care game, look no further. What are Crystals Used For? But first, you may be wondering what exactly it is that crystals do. Crystals are used most often as alternative medicine. How crystals work depends on the exact crystal and what you are looking to restore. In most cases, the presence of a crystal alone is believed to emit strong healing energy that can impact all in the vicinity. It may be easier to think of crystals as energetic healing. Varying healing crystals may aid in resolving physical ailments, reducing stress and anxiety, generating creativity and focus, promoting love and optimism, facilitating rest and alleviating insomnia, and so much more. There truly is a crystal out there to assist with any issue you are facing. How Do I Cleanse My Crystals? If you're unfamiliar with crystals, you may be wondering \"Why do I need to cleanse my crystals?\" Well, no crystal can properly channel its healing properties if it has not been cleansed. Cleansing keeps a crystal's energy pure. You want pure energy when using crystals so that no negative energy can interfere with your healing. It is advised to cleanse your crystals before and after each use if you're using them for things like tarot readings and meditation. However, other crystals only require regular cleansing. There are multiple ways to cleanse crystals. Here are just a few: The Full Moon The full moon is one of the most influential natural forces we know. This could be why a full moon cleansing is quite popular. All you need is a clear sky on a full moon night. Place your crystals anywhere in the moon's view from your windshield to your yard. Let them cleanse and recharge overnight, but try to bring them back inside as soon as you wake up. Smudging Smudging is an ancient technique that has been popularized in modern trends. Smudging is the same thing as lighting sage to get rid of bad energy. Other healing herbs\u2014like palo santo, cedar, or lavender\u2014work wonders as well. Light your healing herb of preference and wave it over your crystals for at least 30 seconds. If you're not known to wake up before the sun is beaming, this method will work better for your crystals as it will not damage their appearance as the bright sun could. Sound Sound healing isn't just for us; it can be for our crystals, too. Any type of sound bath that lasts for at least five minutes should do the trick. This could be chanting, sound bowls, or tuning forks. Water Although you could use tap water with some salt sprinkled in as a cleansing tool, using nature's water (like rainfall or ocean water) is better. Remember, all things involved in crystal healing should be as pure as possible and this includes how we cleanse them. Anywhere from a couple of hours to a full day in a bowl of natural water will do wonders. This method, however, is not advised for softer crystals like selenite. Cleansing Crystals Quartz and selenite are crystals with multiple properties including cleansing properties. You will want to use a large stone and place your smaller crystals on top of or around in close proximity to be cleansed. This method will take several hours or preferably overnight. Burial The burial method is one of the most intensive, but it can really give your crystals a deep cleanse. Place your crystals only a few inches into the ground for at least 24 hours (but up to several days), allowing the earth to remove all negative energy. Some stones, such as tiger's eye, recharge exquisitely with this method. Visualization Your energy is more powerful than you know and can be used to cleanse and connect with your stones simultaneously. This highly energetic practice calls for cleansing one stone at a time, and you will need to be a in positive or clear energetic space to do it. Place the crystal in your hands (or dominant alone) and begin breathing/meditating while visualizing a pure, radiant, white light. Breathe and visualize the light growing around and entering your stone as you feel the negative energy leave it. This method may take at least one minute, but could last several until you feel the stone has been restored. Once you're certain your crystal is radiating pure energy, your self-care can begin! Here are five crystals ideal for self-care, how to use them, or where to put them. Amethysts best crystal for spiritual healing You'll never enter a spiritual shop and not see amethysts.
