This Fact Sheet offers suggestions for selection of solvents for use in chemical reactions, extractions, and purifications in chemical research labs. The Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) group at Pfizer Global Research and Development initiated a project to assess the suitability of common solvents based on criteria of (i) Worker Safety, (ii) Process Safety, and (iii) Environmental and regulatory considerations.
