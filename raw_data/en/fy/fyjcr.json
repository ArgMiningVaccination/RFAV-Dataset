Hi Sheila, can you walk us through the thought-process of starting your business? I spent many years unable to sleep a full night, feeling depressed, anxious, and dissatisfied in life. Also, all my muscles were tensed and my nasal allergies raged wild. One evening, I had an anger-filled outburst that was out of proportion to what happened. The next day, I knew I needed to turn my awareness toward what truly plagued me. So, I started to breathe consciously, immerse myself in sound baths, experiment with crystals, and other forms of energy healing. It took a bit but eventually, my anxiety calmed down tremendously, my depression turned into joy and smiles, my allergies settled more, and I started sleeping through the night. It was so gradual and subtle, that I didn't notice the change in my emotions and body right away. When I did feel myself consistently more balanced and centered, I thought \"I'd pay millions of dollars for this peace that I'm feeling.\" That's when I knew that I needed to bring energy healing and self-love to people of South Florida. What should our readers know about your business? The Sanctuary for Mind, Body & Spirit helps people access peace, relieve high-level stress, and heal emotionally and physically. Today's modern world is full of distractions with social media, chiming phones, 24-hour news cycle, and endless emails. The Sanctuary provides a haven for people to disconnect from the pressures of life, so they can reconnect with themselves and tap into their inner guidance for purpose, meaning, joy, love and abundance. We lead people to harmony and balance via: Reiki - a form of energy healing that transfers universal life force energy to promote the recipient's self-healing abilities. Crystal Healing - Gemstones are placed on the body for relaxation and realignment of negative energy blocks. Guided Meditation - Calming the mind and slowing down the nervous system so that we become aware of our thoughts and body. Breathwork - Conscious connected breathing induces peace and releases tension and stuck emotions. Events - A line up of events promote stillness, self-awareness, and spiritual healing. The Sanctuary was born out of a quest to relieve myself from anxiety, depression, and dissatisfaction in life. Once I self-healed from a negative mindset and found peace, I knew I needed to bring this level of personal freedom to others! Any places to eat or things to do that you can share with our readers?
