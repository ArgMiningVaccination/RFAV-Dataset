In its own way, your jour- nal Eurosurveillance is evolving in response to the challenges of collaboration across many more borders. This first issue of what will be the quarterly printed version of the journal provides the Editorial Team with the opportunity to restate what Eurosurveillance aims to achieve on your behalf, and to set out the changes we have introduced to serve the enlarged Europe and face the changing needs of communic able disea se professionals. Since 1995, Eurosurveillance has been providing a publishing service for the prompt exchange of peer-reviewed scientific in- formation from a Europe-wide perspective, to all those who are directly concerned with communic able disease surveillance, pre- vention and control throughout the European Union and Norway. The collaboration that produces Eurosurveillance has several goals: The dissemination of authoritative information to acceler- ate implementation of effective communicable disease surveil-lance and prevention, and promote in ternat ional awarenes s across Europe in responding to communicable disease; The maintenance and development of a Europe-wide read- ership of public health and infectious disease professionals thatin an emergency situation is sensitised to receiving rapidly au- thoritativ e, professional information from the European Commission, designated national authorities, and others (suchas the World Health Organization); The building of capacity and training in public health through making selected information available to the enlarged Europe, and to give authors a European specific tool for publishinghigh quality papers indexed by Medline; Improving access to valuable information and sources by pro- viding an easily searchable archive and popular portal where care-fully chosen key links are maintained; Promoting the Network Approach (Decision 2119/98/EC [1]) through publishing communicable disease information and deci- sions fr om the Commission, and surveillance outputs from Dedicated Surveillance Networks; Enlarging and strengthening the European group of editors of national ep idemio logical bulletins (Editorial Advisors) to im- prove cooperation between member states. To achieve these goals, from 2004, Eurosurveillance is draw- ing on the respective benefits of el ectronic dissemination of in- formation and the tangible p aper-format publication: the quarterly Eurosurveillance has been created to respond to this challenge. The electronic format of Eurosurveillance will be ma intained and strengthened to offer public health readers regular andrapid publication on both a monthly and weekly basis, free of charge. These updates are available to all on our website, www.eu- rosurveillance.org, and will also be emailed to all subscribers. Original articles (with abstracts in various European languages), outbre ak and surveillance reports, and articles related to pol- icy issues will be updated on the website as Eurosurveillance Monthly; shorter weekly reports and important news, with occa- sional ad hoc electronic alerts (e-alerts) to respond to interna- tional outbrea ks or any other major event threatening public health, will be on the website in Eurosurveillance Weekly. In parallel, and each quarter, our youngest publication, the quarterly journal Eurosurveillance , will gather together a wide selection of articles already published online over the previous quarter in a completely redesigned print journal available free of charg e: original articles, surveillance reports and policy ar- ticles, together with a selection of the weekly short reports and news. The collaboration that produces the journal has expanded and now incl udes Editorial Advisors (usually the editor of their na- tional commun icable disease epidemiological bulletin) from all the EU coun tries, including the 10 new member states, and Norway. This powerful group is supplemented by a smaller group ofAssociate Editors who support the editorial team by providing in-dependent strategic review of the project, and providing crite-ria for evaluating and selecting the material submitted. Independent peer review is essential to maintain the quality ofthe information published. All material, apart from occasional news reports, is reviewed by at least two external experts, usu- ally from countries other than where the authors were from. The extra space available in the new quarterly format has given us the opportunity to introduce a letters section. We hope you will take full advantage of this to let us know what youthink of the service provided and to comment in det ail on the is- sues raised by the material presented. Most ofall, we look forward to continuing to receive high quality submissions from all of you who are involved in combating communicable diseases across Europe.

The European surveillance scheme for travel associated le- gionnaires' disease (EWGLINET) was established in 1987 to operate in this type of context and has been highly active in sharing information and co- ordinating its actions since then. In July 2002 European guidelines were introduced by EWGLINETthat have standardised the response to clustersacross most countries in Europe. Three paperspresented in this special issue show how the guide- lines have been successfully adopted in France (1), Italy (2) and Spain (3), despite the additionalworklo ad associated with their implementation. The paper from the coordinating centre in London provides an overview ofEWGLINET results in 2002. Tourism is a major industry in many European countries and sensitive to health threat s. In France and Spain around 77 mil- lion and 40 million persons resp ective ly are estimated to visit annually, with similar high numbers reported to visit Italy. The resident population in each of these countries also adds to the high number of tourists each year. The importance of re- porting cases of legionnaires' disease in indigenous travellersto EWGLINET is borne out by the fact that Italy and Spain respectively reported that 54% and 40.6% of their clusters in- cluded both indigenous and foreign persons. In France only 24% ofthe clusters were reported to include both French and non- French tourists, with most comprising French nationals only, reflecting the very high number of indigenous travellers in that country. Clusters constituting cases from more than one country wou ld presumably have remained undetected had there been no international reporting and follow up collaborationsthrough the EWGLINET scheme. The control and prevention of travel associated legionnaires' disease depends on international collaborations and the good will of nat ional authorities to provide the reso urces and expertise for best pu blic health to be practiced. Once clusters are detected, investigating the en vironmental source of infection is relatively straightforward since the accommodation site used by the case s is normally the focus point, supported by epidemio- logical data. The rapid response by the country of infection also results in the majority of hotel-associated clusters comprising less than four ca ses ea ch. In contrast, non-travel associated legionella out- breaks, ie those that have a source of infection mainly affecting a population within a wide- spread ge ographical area may be much more dif- ficult to in vestigate an d control and frequently involve a large number of cases. The French health authorit ies have recent ly been confronted with such an outbreak and its cont rol. It is the first time that an industrial cooling tower is known to be implicated in an outbreak in France. The coolingtower o ft h e c h e mical plant was in criminated as the most likely source of this prolonged common source outbreak. The clean- ing and disinfection interventions on the cooling tower mayhave pl ayed a role in continuing to disseminate the environ- mental source, after the plant was shut down, thus contributing to the prolonged course of the outbreak. Non-travel associated outbreaks may be politically sensi- tive for the country concerned b ut require national legislation forcontrol and prevention. Travel associated legionella outbreaks require internat ional actions and to this end all collaborating countries in EWGLINET are c ommitted to the goal of improving health protection for travellers. All parties involved in tourismand international aspects of public health value EWGLINET's unique role in this process. References 1. Decludt B, Campese C, Lacoste M, Che D, Jarraud S, Etienne J.

This report adds ev- idence to th e rapid geographical dissemination of this emerg- ing, hyper-virulent variant of an 'old pathogen' across Europe. First reported in the early 1990s among aboriginal populations in Western Australia, outbreaks of c-MRSA infections have more recently been described in population groups such as prison inmates, injecting drug users, sportsteams and school children, in the United States and Europe. Current evidence from molecular stud- ies points to the spread in each continent of a lim- ited number of PVL-producing MRSA clones that are genetically distinct from epidemic nosocomialstrain s. This represents a public health threat, because these strains are associated with severesoft tissue and pulmonary infection and the outcome of MRSA in- fection is wors e than with infection caused by beta-lactam sus- ceptible S. aureus , especially if inappropriately treated with beta-lactams that are usually prescribed for these infections.We must, therefore, upgrade the diagnostic work-up for this kind of infection in the outpatient setting and adapt empirical therapy accordingly. Moreover, surveillance should be intensified to monitor the incid ence of MRSA an d detect and control out- breaks in the community. In this respect, the report by Witte et al underscores the important early warning role that reference laboratories can play by using high resolution molecular mark- ers based on routine typing and susceptibility data. This emerging threat of c-MRSA highlights the rapid and un- predictable evo lution of human pathogens under the interplay of ant ibiotic selective pressure and changes in society. Antimicrobial resistance is a multifactorial phenomenon, re-quiring multidisciplinary study and multimodal control inter- ventions. Also in this issue, Bronzwaer et al review progress achieved since the launch by the European Union in 2001 of theCommunity Strategy against Antimicrobial Resistance (EuropeanAntimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System, EARSS). A im-pressive number of na tional initiatives an d Community actions have been implemented to enhance surveillance, prevention, research and product development, and international coopera- tion, and these will be expanded in the next few years. The European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) (2) is contributing, together with other learnedsocieties, to the international mobilisation of health profes-sionals against antimicrobial resistance. Our society's found- ing prin ciple is the close integration of laboratory and clinical science and practice in the study, prevention and treatment of infection. To disseminate professional and scientific excellence,we organise postgradu ate training courses and a summer school. ESCMID supports several study groups investigating the antimi- crobial resistance problem, and p rovides scientific advice to sur- veillance program mes funded under the Community public health programme like EARSS and European Surveillance of AntimicrobialConsumption (ESAC). This programme will also fund the EuropeanCommittee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) thatis operated by ESCMID to serve as an umbrella for all national standar d committees within the EU. EUCAST is making much awaited progres s in harmonising national guidelines across Europe on antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing methodsand interpretation criteria. The development of European stan- dards of hospital surveillance and control practice is also on the agenda of ESCMID projects like the Antibiotic Resistance and Control (ARPAC) project funded un-der the Fifth Framework Program (FP5). The European conference on the role of research in combating antibiotic resistan ce, organised in Rome by ESCMID and the Research Directorate-General of the European Commission (3), attracted160 delegates from 30 countries, including bio- medical scientists, microbiologis ts, clinicians, epidemiologists and representatives from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. A partnership between all stakeholders is needed to find the right balance between public health needs for new an- timicrobial drugs on the one hand, and the economic constraints of drug discovery and develop ment on the other. Participants re- viewed current knowledge and id entified gaps in our under- standing of antimicrobial resistance in human pathogens, andstressed the severe underfundin g in this research area. The conference recommendations on research priorities will be pub- lished in Clinical Microbiology and Infection. As highlighted by the SARS pandemic, control of communicable infections is a pressing public health challenge of global pro- portions. The control of antimicrobial resistance is part ofmeeting this challenge. In this light, the proposal by Commissioner Byrne to establish the European Centre for DiseasePrevention and Control (ECDC) by 2005 must be commended as atimely step. Effective control requires close cooperation be- tween l aboratory scientists, epidemiologists and public health practitioners. ESCMID has published a position paper that rec- ommends developing laboratory facilities at the ECDPC to sup- port commun icable disease surveillance (2). Furthermore, establishing European reference laboratories and integrating them with new centre s of excell ence in infectious diseases re- search would boost European research capacity and help to de-velop a sense of collective responsibility among biomedical scientists and healthcare professionals. In my view, the debate on the size and scope of the ECDC comes down to how much we, as European citizens, are prepared to invest in multilateralresearch and response capacity to pr otect the public against in- fectious disease. 1.

Rodney Cartwright Medical Advisor, United Kingdo m Federation of Tour Operators, UK Improvements in public health and the control of communi- cable diseases throughout Europe have been achieved due to the multidisciplinary approach and not only as a result of efforts ofpublic health physicians. The conclusions of the Spanish team (1) that studie d the outbreak of gastroenteritis in tourists visiting the Dominican Republic provides a good example of theneed forboth cross discipline and international cooperation. Tourism is one of the top three global economic forces, with an increasing number of to urists each year. It is estimated that there are over 70 million package holidays sold in Europe an- nually with destinations worldwide. The tourists are exposedto a wide range of conditions and pathogenic organisms. There is, however, a paucity of information on the infections acquired by these tourists during their travels. Surveillanceis rudime ntary, and relies larg ely on reported ill- nesses in those who remain ill, or develop an ill- ness, on their return home. Apart from infections such as typhoid fever, there is rarely any follow up, and the transfer of timely information be- tween th e health mini stries of different coun- tries is variable. The majority of travel acquiredinfections cause illness during the stay in a des- tination country, are hardly ever recorded in any official surveill ance system, and are equally rarely investigated. Yet questionnaire studies (2-5) on returning travellers, or in resorts, indicate that there is a considerableincidence of gastric upsets in tourists travelling to a number of destinat ions. This form of surveillance does not provide in- formation on the causative organisms, but does provide a pointer forfurther investigation into the illnesses, the level of the pub- lic health infrastructure, and the effectiveness of any food hy- giene pr ograms. The information has been used by the major British tour operators in discussion with the governments of hol- iday destination countries. The failure of official surveillance systems to detect these illnesses is due in part to confusion about who is responsible for dealing with tourists' gastrointestinal upsets. Most of those who are ill in a resort leave for home in a matter of days, and in other cases the illness may only become apparent after the tourists have returned home.The importance of these illnesses, some of which are mild and of short duration, should not be underestimated. They cause discomfo rt to those directly affected but will also have an impact on the holiday enjoyment of others in their party. There may in addition be severe economic consequences for the resort community, especially if tourism is adversely affected by bad media coverage in the tourists' home countries. The tourist industry will usually become aware of a problem at an early stage as tourists complain to the local represen-tatives. This information needs to be shared with health offi- cials in both the home and the holiday countries. Nationalsurveillance systems need to be aware of travel connections andwhile maintaining patient confidentiality, need to alert othercountries and the tourist industry of potential trouble areas. The speed of travel and the numbers of travellers make it very important for even unsubstantiated data to be shared at an early date. There may be no laboratory diagnosis but as we all know, John Snow was able to take action before the cholera vibrio was recognised. The prompt transfer of data between health de- partments of different countries and the tourist industry, which can directly and immediately in- fluence hoteliers, would be an important step in reducing the burden of gast rointestinal illness in tourists. The development of working arrange- ments between national health departments, tour operators and hoteliers should be encouraged before an incident occurs, with an emphas is on the implementation of effective preven- tative programs. 1.

Cases of legionnaires' disease are detected and followed-up by na- tional surveillance schemes, and those defined as travel-associatedare reported to the EWGLINET coordinating centre at theCommunicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC) in London and are entered into the EWGLINET database. Epidemiological, micro-biological and travel histories are reported. Upon receipt of a newcase, the database is searched by the coordinating centre for anyprevious cases reported to have stayed at the same accommodationsite within the last two years. In July 2002, European guidelines were introduced to standard- ise the response that countries made to EWGLINET notifications (1).Different levels of intervention are expected from the public healthauthorities for sites associated with single or multiple cases. Theseinclude issuing a checklist for minimizing risk of legionella infectionat sites associated with single cases, and conducting risk assess-ments, sampling for legionella and implementing control measuresat sites associated with clusters. The guidelines have introduced a pro-cedure whereby the country of infection is expected to carry out a risk assessment and initial control measures within two weeks, and sampling and full control measures within six weeks of receipt of thenotification. Both of these stages are do cumented by the collabora- tor in the country of infection, by completion of standard forms ('Form A ' and 'Form B') which are sent to the EWGLINET coordi-nating centre. If this documentation is not received in the specifiedtime period, EWGLINET publishes details of the cluster on its pub-lic website (www.ewgli.org) since the coordinating centre cannotbe confident that the accommodation has adequate control meas-ures in place. The notification is removed once the relevant form(s)have been received confirming that measures to minimise the riskoflegionella at the site have been carried out. Results Cases and Outcome In 2002, 57 collaborators from 50 centres in 36 countries (FIGURE 1) participated in EWGLINET. Twenty of these countries re- ported a total of 676 cases of travel associated legionnaires' diseasewith onset in 2002. Each year, cases reported to EWGLINET follow a distinctive age and sex profile. In 2002, male cases continued to outnumber fe-male cases by nearly 2.5 to 1, and the peak age-group reported was50-59 years for both sexes. The age range for males was 13-89 yearsand for females 22-89 years.Twenty countries reported 676 cases of travel associated le- gionnaires' disease to the EWGLINET surveillance scheme, and 94 clusters were detected. 80.5% of all cases were diagnosed by the urinary antigen test. On average there were 20.5 days between onset and report ofcases, compared with 51.5 days in 1993. Between the introduction of the EWGLI investigation guidelines(on 1st July 2002) and the end of 2002, 37 six-week investiga-tion reports were acce pted as satisfactory and on time by the coordinating centre. 274 sites were investigated in total in 2002.The travel patterns of the main reporters in EWGLINET influ-enced th e months of peak activity, and helped to determine which countries bore the greatest investigation burden. Euro Surveill 2004;9(2):6-9 Published online Feb 2004 Key words : Legionnaires' disease, travel, Europe, European guidelines Introduction In 1987, a European surveillance scheme for travel-associated legionnaire's disease (now called EWGLINET) was established by theEuropean Working Group for Legionella Infections (EWGLI). The aims of this scheme are to monitor levels of travel associated le-gionnaires' disease in Europe, detect clusters and outbreaks, and collaborate in the control and prevention of further cases. Its history and current activities are described in detail on its website(www.ewgli.org). This paper provides results and commentary on cases reported to EWGLINET with onset in 2002. MethodsA single case of travel associated legionnaires' disease is defined as a person who, in the ten days before onset of illness, stayed at orvisited an accommodation site that had not been associated with any other cases of legionnaires' disease, or a person who stayed at an ac-commodation site linked to other cases of legionnaires' disease but after an interval of at least two years (1). A cluster of travel associated legionnaires' disease is defined as two or more cases who stayed at or visited the same accommodation site 6 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 1-3* on behalf of the European Working Group for Legionella Infections Health Protection Agency CDSC, London, UKAs in previous years, the date of on- set followed a seasonal pattern. The number of cases increased from January through the year, with peaks in July and September, before decreasing throughout the rest of the year. The proportion of 'known' out- comes (death or recovery as opposed to 'unknown' outcomes - still ill or un- known) has been decreasing steadilysince about 1995, due largely to an in-crease in the speed of reporting. Thenumber of reported deaths has re- mained similar in 2002 at 43 comparedwith 41 in 2001, despite a large rise in the number of cases, lowering the casefatality rate from 8.5% to 6.4%. Theabsolute number of recoveries in-creased, but fell in 2001 to 29.7% in 2002.The 'still ill' category remained virtu-ally unchanged, but the largest increasewas in the 'unknown' category whereabsolute figures rose from 128 to 232,and the percentage increased from26.6% to 34.3%. MicrobiologyUse of the urinary antigen test continued to rise, with 80.5% of all cases diagnosed by this method, compared with 78.6% in 2001.Use of other diagnostic tests remained relatively constant. Culture of the organism accounted for 7% of the diagnoses (the same as in2001), serology 11.8%, and other methods 0.7% (F IGURE 2). The main category of organism detected was Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (68.3%). The remaining cases L. pneu- serogroup associated cases are usually diagnosed after they return to their country of residence. The main reporters of cases in 2002 wereThe Netherlands (151), England and Wales (126), France (119) andItaly (68) (F IGURE 2). Cases visited a total of 51 countries. The highest numbers of cases were associated with travel to Italy (132), France (121), Spain(85) or Turkey (83). The proportion of cases linked to clusters wassimilar in three of the four main countries of infection at 25% inFrance and Spain and 24% in Italy. Although Turkey had fewer as- sociated cases, 71% of them were part of clusters (see below) (F IGURE 3). Sixty one cases visited more than one European country, whilst only two visited more than one country outside Europe. A further 63cases (9.3%) were associated with travel to countries outside theEWGLINET scheme, ten of which were in travellers to the USA. ClustersNinety four clusters were identified in 2002 compared with 72 in 2001. These were defined as accommodation sites associated with acase in 2002, where one or more cases within the previous two-yearshad also been associated with the same site. Most clusters involvedonly two cases (60 clusters), but they ranged in size from 2-10 cases.

The clusters were located in 19 countries. Turkey had the most (27), followed by Italy (17) and France (16). Eleven countries hadjust one cluster each in 2002, three of which occurred in countriesoutside EWGLINET (Dominican Republic, Russia and USA). Twelveclusters included cases that had stayed at two or more cluster sitesbefore onset of illness compared with only four such incidents in2001. Most of the detected clusters with onset in 2002 occurred in summer, peaking in September. A second smaller peak was also ob-served around Easter time, however at least three clusters occurredevery month in 2002. Over two thirds (68%) of the clusters included at least two cases with onset within six months of each other. Sixteenclusters (17%) had cases occurring between seven and 12 monthsof each other, and the remaining 14 clusters has cases occurring be-tween 13 and 24 months of each other. Investigations Of the 94 clusters in 2002, 64 were notified between the intro- duction of the guidelines and the end of December 2002, and involved70 accommodation sites. Sixty six of these sites fell within EWGLINETcountries. Between July and December 2002, 37 'Form B' reports were accepted as being completed on time and stating that control meas-ures were satisfactory, 17 sites (26%) had been published on theEWGLI website, and 12 were in the process of being investigated. Four of these published cluster sites (23.5%) have had extra cases subse-quently, and five unpublished sites (10.2%) have also had subse-quent cases. For the whole of 2002, 128 cluster sites were investigated in- cluding 99 which were sampled, from which legionella was reported to have been detected in 35 (35%). 146 single case sites were also in- vestigated, even though the guidelines do not require such sites to be investigated, and of these 106 were sampled, and 45 (42.5%) ofthe sampled sites detected legionella (T ABLE 1). Environmental investigations will be examined in greater detail in a further paper. Discussion2002 saw the highest number of travel associated cases of le- gionnaires' disease reported to EWGLINET since the scheme be- gan in 1987. This rise in case reports is almost certainly linked to wideruse of the urinary detection test and improved surveillance in manyEuropean countries. The fall in the case fatality rate is also part of this general trend whereby less seriously ill cases are being detectedand reported more regularly, and the risk of death is being consid-erably reduced through more rapid diagnosis and application ofappropriate antibiotic therapy, made possible by the widespread in-troduction of the urinary antigen detection test. Whilst rapid di- agnosis has benefited cases, it has also negatively impacted onepidemiological information in relation to the outcome of cases re-ported as \"still ill\" or with unknown outcome, and also on micro-biological information because the lack of clinical isolates preventsanalysis of strain matches between patient and environmental spec-imens. In order to demonstrate that a particular infection comes froma particular site, the clinical sample must be matched with an envi-ronmental sample, and culture is the only method by which this can be done. Eleven per cent of the cases reported to EWGLINET in 2002 did not have data provided on the category of organism detected. Thisis not in accordance with the reporting procedures since all cases re-ported to EWGLINET must state the main method of diagnosis,and each microbiological diagnosis should at the very least determinethe organism ( legionella ) and species (pneumophila). The urinary antigen detection method is highly specific to L. pneumophila serogroup 1, and serological diagnostic methods are capable of de-termining the species and serogroup of Legionella .Since over 90% of the reported cases in 2002 were diagnosed by these methods, themicrobiological information should be available for a large major-ity of the \"unknown\" cases. Any lack of information exchange be-tween laboratories and national collaborating centres should beaddressed to ensure that microbiological details are provided forall cases. This is increasingly important as more and more accom-modation sites are subject to environmental investigations. The main change to occur to the EWGLINET scheme in 2002 was the introduction, on 1st July that year, of the European Guidelinesfor Control and Prevention of Travel Associated Legionnaires'Disease 1.These have now been successfully implemented in the in- vestigation of a large number of sites, including a cluster involving ten cases who stayed at a hotel in Belgium. There is some preference among holiday-makers for travel to particular destinations, and this can influence which countries of in-fection are most often reported to the scheme. This can have inter-esting effects when the preference is country-specific. For instance,Turkey has a market share of 24% of the total Dutch flight travel pack- age market. In the summer of 2002, approximately 600,000 Dutchpackage travellers visited Turkey from a population base of 16 mil-lion. When this is combined with the high frequency of Dutch re-porting to the EWGLINET scheme, it is hardly surprising that somany of the Dutch legionella cases are associated with travel to Turkey. Because of the bias amongst holiday-makers for travel to partic- ular destinations, it is useful to look at the number of EWGLINETcases associated with travel to a particular country, relative to the to-tal number of visitors. The Office of National Statistics Travel andTourism Survey (2) can provide this information for UK travellers (T ABLE 2). Whilst ten UK tourists fell ill after visiting Turkey, giving a rate of 9.95 cases per million UK travellers, the thirty-five UKtourists who fell ill after visiting Spain give a rate of only 2.78 trav- ellers because there is so much more UK travel to Spain, than toTurkey. France and Italy have begun to report more cases associated with internal travel within their own country; this has greatly increasedtheir number of case reports to the coordinating centre (76 out of121 cases travelling in France in 2002 were French, whilst 60 out of132 cases were Italians travelling in Italy). This has an effect on themain countries of infection reported to the scheme, as described 8 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 1-3All sites n Legion elladetected 80 Legion ellanot detected 125 Unknown 69 Total 274 Clust er sites n Legion elladetected 35 Legion ellanot detected 64 Unknown 29 Total 128TABLE 1 Results of environmental sampling for cluster sites and for all sites, where investigations were carried out in 2002.above. However, it also highlights the fact that many countries do not notify EWGLINET of travel-associated cases in their own coun-try by their own residents, and EWGLINET may therefore be miss- ing an unknown number of clusters. The EWGLI guidelines have now been successfully introduced in all EU member states, with support from the Ministry of Health ineach country. Norway, Turkey and a large number of the accessioncountries have also agreed to use them. In the majority of countries, the guidelines are functioning well, and clusters of cases of legion-naires' disease are being investigated and dealt with promptly. Turkeyhas adapted less successfully to the introduction of the guidelines and,as a result, has had more sites published on the EWGLI website todate than any other country. Assistance has been offered by EWG-LINET to help countries such as Turkey reach the standard achievedby the majority. However, the fact that overall, nine of the cluster sites in Europe in 2002 have yielded additional cases subsequent tosatisfactory control and prevention measures being reported is of con-cern.The countries involved should investigate the reason for these breakdowns, otherwise the long term credibility of the proceduresadopted in the guidelines may be called into question. Investigations that include sampling are now expected for all cluster sites, and they have shown a number of accommodationsites to be positive for legionella .Whilst these sites cannot conclu- sively be proven as the source of infection in the absence of clinicalisolates for comparison, the presence of legionella is highly sugges- tive of the sites being the source. However, the proportion of pos-itive legionella detections from water samples varies widely between countries, suggesting that some laboratories may be more success- ful than others in identification of the organism rather than an ab-sence of the organism itself in the tested samples. Closure of accommodation sites is at the discretion of local pub- lic health authorities, but the introduction of the guidelines hasstandardised the responses expected of the implicated sites. T our op-erators and individual members of the public may withdraw fromsites associated with large or extended outbreaks of legionnaires'disease, or when the accommodation name is posted on the EWGLIwebsite. Sites that contract with the large tour operators face sig- nificant consequences if their name appears on the website, andthey are therefore normally amenable to implementing the controlmeasures expected of them. The cost of the measures is probably farlower than the loss of business should the tour operators withdraw. The one major outbreak in Belgium in 2002 demonstrated how well the EWGLINET system can work to detect and respond to clusters.The cluster was centred around hotel 'X' in Belgium and consistedof ten cases, six English, three French and one Scottish. Each case vis-ited at least two of seven independent hotels, except for one case whovisited only hotel X, which was additionally the only hotel visited by all of the other cases. The hotel was c losed whilst investigations were carried out. An indistinguishable strain of L. pneumophila serogroup 1 was isolated from a patient sample from one of the outbreak casesand from water samples from the hotel X's water system. It is veryimportant to establish this confirmatory link between cases and thesource of infection, particularly when cases may have stayed at sev-eral hotels before onset of illness and when some of these hotelsmay also be linked to other clusters. The fact that this scenario is oc-curring more frequently than in previous years highlights one of theproblems of an ever increasing database of accommodation sites.Many sites will feature in clusters simply by chance because of their use by tour operators and tourists alike. Because of the trend for an increasing number of cases being re- ported to EWGLINET each year, it is important to consider what mayhappen to the scheme in future years. If the average increase in thenumber of cases each year from 1993-2002 is taken (121.3% each year), and then assumed for the years 2003 - 2008, EWGLINET could be dealing with over 2000 cases in 2008. Obviously there are many variables which can affect this. The projection assumes con-tinuous growth of the scheme at the current rate, a continued increasein the uptake of urinary antigen testing, additional countries join-ing the scheme and contributing new cases, and an increase in sur-veillance by existing countries. The projection also assumes a reduction in the level of under diagnosis, a reduction in the level of under reporting, and it assumes that the impact of the guidelines isdelayed until the true level of incidence is obtained. Ifthe number of cases does continue increasing in line with this projection, this has large implications for workload, both for theco-ordinating country and for the collaborators in the countries of report and infection, the latter of whom must ensure that each clus- ter is investigated thoroughly. The increase in multi-site clusters ad- ditionally threatens to increase the workload for all involved. However,the increase in cases reported to EWGLINET should be seen as a pos-itive development, and not just as a problem to be overcome. Itdemonstrates that case detection by national surveillance schemesfor legionnaires' disease is improving, which allows for more rapidand complete ascertainment of clusters, and this in turn gives an op-portunity for countries to respond to outbreaks in a more timely andefficient manner.

Eight per cent (28.6%) would not have been identified without thenetwork.The clusters detected were small, ranging from 2 cases to a max-imum of 6. All clusters involved 5 camping sites and 30 ho- tels/residences, and an overall of 87 patients. The diagnosis was confirmed in 92.0% of the cases and mainly performed by urinary antigen detection (84.7%). A clinical isolate was available only in one case. Following environmental investigations, samples were collectedfor all the 35 clusters from the water system, and Legionella pneu- mophila was found in 23 occasions (65.7%). In 15 resorts out of 35, investigations were already in progress at the time of EWGLI cluster notific ation, since in Italy full environmental investiga- tion is performed even after notification of a single case. Control measures were implem ented in all accommodation sites at risk and one hotel only was closed. In all the 35 clusters, reports were completed and sent on time,highlighting that it is possible to comply with the procedures re- quested by the European Guidelines. Euro Surveill 2004;9(2):10-1 Published online Feb 2004Key words : Legionn aires' disease, surveillance, travel, Italy, European guidelines Introduction After France and Spain, Italy receives the largest number of for- eign tourists per year. In 2002, in Italy, 639 cases of Legionnaires'Disease (LD) of which 119 were travel associated, were notified to theInstituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0. Furthermore, a further 90 cases diag- nosed in foreign tourists who travelled to Italy were notified to theInstitute by EWGLINET (The European Working Group for Legionella Infections, http://www.ewgli.org), bringing the total num-ber of cases of travel associated LD to 209. This is an increase of ap-proximately 60% on the previous year when 130 cases were noti-fied. Most of the foreign tourists came from other European countries,such as the United Kingdom (23%), Netherlands (19%) and France(13%). In July 2002, European guidelines for control and prevention of travel associated Legionnaires' disease were voluntarily adopted by most EWGLINET participant countries, even though at that time theywere not yet officially approved by the European Commission. This article reports on the Italian experience following the adop- tion of the European Guidelines. MethodsAccording to the guidelines, a cluster is defined as two or more cases who stayed at or visited the same accommodation site in theten days before onset of illness and whose onset is within the same two year period. Identification of a cluster is sufficient to warrant im-mediate action by the coordinating centre in London and by theEWGLINET collaborator in the country where the cluster is located. The collaborator in the affected country immediately arranges forthe accommodation site to be inspected by a local public health au-thority who carries out a risk assessment as well as an environ-mental investigation. A preliminary report (Form A) stating whethercontrol measures are in progress and if the accommodation site may remain open or not is sent to the coordinating centre within twoweeks of the cluster alert. A full report (Form B) is sent within six weeks of the cluster alert. If the coordinating centre does not receive the reports on time or if the control measures adopted are unsatis-factory, the name of the accommodation site is published on theEWGLI website (1). In Italy, the procedure for reporting and responding to cluster is as follows: when EWGLINET alerts the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0of a cluster, the EWGLINET collaborator immediately informs lo-cal and regional health authorities and the Ministry of Health by fax.The day after the notification the EWGLINET collaborator makesa phone call to the doctor in charge of the investigation, in order toensure that cluster alert was received. One or two days before thedeadline for Form A and B, a reminder is sent to the local health au-thority. Data related to clusters were entered into a database and analysed by EPI Info 2000. 10 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 Centro di di Sanita, Rome, ItalyEUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 1-3 / w w w .eurosurveillance.org 11Legionnaires' disease FIGURE Number of clusters reported by Italian regions from July 2002 to October 2003Results From July 2002 to October 2003, 35 clusters of travel associated legionnaires' disease occurred in Italy. Of the 35 resorts involved, five were campsites and 30 were hotels/residences. The number of clinical cases per cluster was the following: 2 cases in 20 clusters, 3 cases in 7 clusters, 4 cases in 5 clusters, 5 casesin 2 clusters and 6 cases in 1 cluster. Overall, 87 patients were involved(8 patients visited 2 hotels, 1 visited 3 hotels) in a total of 97 visits. The second case occurred less than 6 months after the notifica- tion of the first case in 69% of the clusters. The age of the cases ranged from 27 to 78 years, with a mean of 58 years. The male to female ratio was 2.1/1. Italian citizens repre-sented 40.2% of all cases and were involved in 19 clusters. In 9 clus-ters, only Italian citizens were involved. Dutch citizens were affected in 14.9% of cases, French citizens 9.2%, and German and English cit-izens both in 6.9% of cases. The remaining 21.9% of the cases werepatients from other European countries. The accommodation sites were located in 14 different Italian re- gions, as shown (F IGURE ). The median length of stay in an accom- modation was 7.8 days, with a range of one to 152 days The diagnosis was confirmed in 92% of the cases and investiga- tions were mainly performed using urinary antigen detection(84.7%). A clinical isolate was available only in one case. The out-come of the disease was known in 74.4% of the cases. Of these, 59% recovered, 36% were still ill and 5% were dead by the time the clus- ter was alerted. Environmental investigations were performed by the local health authorities and samples were collected from the water system at thelocations of all 35 clusters. In I taly, a full environmental investiga- tion is undertaken even after notification of a single case, and in 15resorts out of 35, when the first case was an Italian citizen, at the time of EWGLI cluster notification, investigations were already in progress. Legionella pneumophila was found on 23 occasions (65.7%). In 6 cases (26%), Legionella pneumophila was present in the water sup- ply at a concentration ranging from 10 2and 103CFU/L, while in 12 (52%) cases the concentration was higher than 104CFU/L. For the remaining cases (22%), the Legionella concentration was not known. In clusters with 2 or 3 cases the percentage of positive investigation results was 58% while in clusters with 4 or more cases this percent- age was equal to 87%. Contr ol measures were implemented in all accommodation sites at risk and only one hotel was closed. Form A and B were sent on time for all clusters, and so no names of accommodation sites were published on the public part of theEWGLI website. Discussion The rapid exchange of information among European countries through the EWGLINET network allows the detection of clusters evenwhen cases are from a different country of origin. For the cases as- sociated with travel in Italy, 8 clusters (28.6%) would not have beenidentified without this network since each included one national fromdifferent countries. The clusters detected were small, ranging in sizefrom 2 to a maximum of 6 cases.Investigation immediately following a cluster alert found that 65.7% of the sites were positive for Legionella .This highlights the fact that risk assessment for control measures against Legionella bacte- ria proliferation should be carried out not only in response to a cluster but on a regular basis in order to prevent cases of disease. This information is also important for assessing the impact of con- trol measures at a site, as well as for providing evidence for any le- gal action arising from an infecti on. However, interpretation of the significance of environmental data results is limited when there areno matching clinical isolates from associated cases. The environ-mental investigations conducted show that investigation and re- porting procedures take varying amounts of time, depending onthe structure and organization of public health services in each re-gion. Nevertheless, for all 35 clusters, reports were completed and sent in on time, demonstrating that it is possible to comply with theprocedures requested by the European guidelines. Investigationsand control measures were successful in preventing further casesin 31 out of 35 accommodation sites investigated. In the 4 accom-modation sites where a new case was notified in a time period rang-ing from 2 to 8 months after implementation of control measures,a longer and stricter follow-up is foreseen.

The French national institute of public health surveil-lance (Institut de Veille Sanitaire) notifies the coordinating centre inLondon of all the French cases of legionellosis in patients who had been travelling during the incubation period in France or in othercountries, and receives notifications of foreign cases travelling in France. When a cluster is detected by the French national surveillance sys- tem or through EWGLINET, the local health authorities are imme- diately informed and an environmental investigation is conducted.A preliminary report stating whether control measures are in progressand if the hotel remains open or not should be sent to the co-ordi-nating centre within two weeks (Form A) from the cluster alert,while a full report (Form B) should be sent within six weeks fromthe cluster alert. Local health authorities are responsible for fillingthese forms, which are available in French, to notify surveillancenetworks of the conclusion of their investigation. ResultsBetween September 2001 and August 2003, EWGLINET and the French national surveillance system identified 37 clusters located at various French tourist accommodation sites. Thirteen clustersoccurred between September 2001 and August 2002 and 24 betweenSeptember 2002 and August 2003. These clusters occurred in 27hotels and 10 campsites. The number of clinical cases per cluster was as follows: 30 clus- ters of 2 cases (81%), 6 clusters of 3 cases (16%) and 4 consisting of a single case (3%) giving a total of 82 cases. The mean age of the caseswas 60 years (range 27-96 years). Most of the cases were male (80%)and the sex ratio male/female was 4. According to the European case definition (4), 75 (91%) cases were confirmed and 7 (9%) were probable. Diagnosis was by detection of urinary antigen for 67 cases (82%), by culture for 6 (7.3%), and bya four fold rise in specific serum antibody titre for 2 (2.4%). Five pa-tients had a single high titre and 2 were diagnosed by PCR. The mean length of patients' stay at the accommodation sites was 5 days (range 1-27 days). Most of the accommodation siteswere lo cated in southern France (F IGURE ). Twenty four of the patients who stayed at cluster sites also stayed at other sites in France, whilst4 also stayed at sites in other European countries. French citizens were involved in 9 (24.3%) clusters together with other European citizens whereas in 16 (43.2%) clusters, patientswere exclusively French. In 12 (32.5%) other clusters, only other European citizens were affected. The mean time interval between the first and second case was 94 days (range 0-626 days) and in 13 (35%) clusters, the interval wasClusters oftravel associated legionnaires' disease warrant urgent attention, and are detected by the French national surveillance system and the European network EWGLINET. Between September 2001 and August 2003, 37 clusters wereidentified in French tourist accommodation: 27 hotels and 10 campsite s. The number of clinical cases per cluster was as fol- lows: 30 clusters of 2 cases (81%), 6 clusters of 3 cases (16%)and 4 consisting of just one case (3%) a total of 82 cases. The local health authorities performed environmental investiga-tions for 36 of the 37 clusters. Among the 36 clusters inves- tigate d, water samples were coll ected for 35. At 16 (46%) sites, Legione lla pneumophila was foun d at a level of more than 10 3cfu/litre. In all of the accommodation where risk assess- ment was foun d to be inadequat e- control measures were im- plemen ted immediately. Six hote ls were closed immediately followin g cluster alerts. Comparison of clinical and environmental isolates by pulsedfield gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was possible in 3 clusters and identical ge nomic profiles of the isol ates were found in all. During this two year period of surveillance, we found that onmany sites there has been a risk of exposure to Legion ella. This reinforces the importance of the European surveillance net- work and the timely notifications of all the cases to EWGLINET. Euro Surveill 2004;9(2):12 -3 Published online Feb 2004 Key words : Legionnaire s' disease, travel, surveillance, France, European guidelines Introduction Every year, it is estimated that 77 million tourists visit France. Most of them (90%) come from other European countries, mainly fromthe United Kingdom (20%), Germany (19%) and the Netherlands(16%). Clusters of travel associated legionnaires' disease are a mat-ter of concern and many outbreaks have been already published (1-3). In 1997, national surveillance of legionnaires' disease washeightened in France and in 2002, 1021 cases were notified to theFrench national surveillance scheme with an incidence of 1.7 cases per 100 000 population (4). In 1998, the French ministry of healthpublished national recommendations on the prevention of exposureto Legionella in public places and accommodation (5,6). In July 2002, the European Guidelines for control and preven- tion of travel associated Legionnaires' disease were adopted at thevoluntary level by most European surveillance of travel associated legionnaires' disease scheme (EWGLINET) participant countries(1). It should be noted that France started following them as fromJuly 2001, one year before their final approval. This paper describesEUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 1-3 / w w w .eurosurveillance.org 13less than one month. In 13 (35%) clusters, the second case occurred more than 6 months after the first case notified was notified. For 36 of the 37 clusters, the local health authorities per- formed environmental investigations. One campsite wasclosed during the winter season at the date of notifica-tion and no investigation was conducted. The investigations were carried out between 0 and 10 days (mean 5 days) after the EWGLINET notification, but for 11 clus-ters, investigation took place prior to the EWGLINET notification. For these clusters, as all patients were French, the French surveillance network was warned before EWGLINET was. Among the 36 clusters investigated, water samples were collected in 35. As one campsite was closed when an investigation was re-quested, only a risk assessment was carried out. In 16 (46%) sites, Legionella pneumophila was found at a level more than 10 3cfu/litre and in 6 (17%) Legionella pneumophila was present at a level between 102 and 103cfu/litre at the time of investi- gation. In 13 (43%) sites, no Legionella pneumophila was found. In 26 (72%) sites, the assessment identified the low temperature of thehot water system and closed off water pipes among the risks present. In all accommodation sites with inadequate risk assessments, control measures were implemented immediately, and 6 hotels were closed immediately after the cluster alert. Form B was sent to the EWGLINET coordinating centre punc- tually in 35 out of 36 cluster in vestigations. The name of one camp- site was published on EWGLINET website but then removed whensatisfactory measures were taken by the owner. Comparison of clinical and environmental isolates by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) at the Centre National de R\u00e9f\u00e9rence(CNR) des Legionella (national reference centre for legionellae) was possible for 3 clusters and identical genomic profile of the isolateswere found in all. Four accommodation sites had previously been linked with clus- ters in 2001, 2002 or 2003. At that time, all the control measures have been taken and controlled by the local health authorities and the formB has been returned with satisfactory conclusion. DiscussionThrough the network, we detected clusters with small numbers of cases but we could assume that control measures have preventeda number of new cases. Good collab oration has meant that numbers of clusters detected have nearly doubled in the two year period. Itis not surprising that most of the clusters were located in the southof France, a popular destination for holidays. The high number of French citizens involved in the clusters can be explained by the fact that there are more French people than for-eigners who travel in France. In fact, data on tourist origins in Franceshows that 63% are French and 37% foreigners (9). The improvement of our surveillance system in the recent years has also allowed a rapid detection of clusters. The previous case definition of a cluster was 2 cases during a six month period. Using this definition, we would have missed 35% ofthe clusters. The risk assessments showed that most of the sites were at risk for Legionella contamination and infection. In nearly half of the sites, contamination with Legionella was more than 103 cfu/l which is the level where action is required to be taken (7). Despite the lowproportion of human cultures obtained, in all the clusters wherecomparison of clinical and environmental isolates was possible, we had confirmation of the source of infection. However, our datashows that 29% of tourists stay in two or more hotels during the in-cubation period, highlighting the problem of interpreting associa-tion between cases and possible multiple sources of infection. It is worrying that 4 sites were previously linked with clustersand the subsequently had an extra case. It may be important to im-plement regular tests at these sites known to be particularly at riskduring a determined period. Appropriate surveillance and time ly notification is necessary for interruption of Legionella transmission from ongoing outbreak sources and for implementation of preventive measures. TheEuropean EWGLINET is a unique, sensitive network (6). It has been very efficient in determining numbers of published European out- breaks (1-3). This reinforces the importance of the European surveillance net- work and the timely notifications of all the cases to EWGLINET, par- ticularly national cases travelling inside their own country as thesecould potentially be linked to other European cases.

Within the framework of the European Surveillance Scheme for Travel Associated Legionnaires' Disease (EWG- LINET), European Guidelines for Control and Prevention of TravelAssociated Legionnaires' Disease have been produced .

Euro Surveill 2004;9(2):14-5 Published online Feb 2004 Key words : Legionnaire s' disease, travel, surveillance, Spain, European guidelines Introduction Spain is among the European Union (EU) countries that receive the largest number of tourists. It is estimated that 30 million tourists(1) visit Spain every year (the population of Spain is 40 million). InSpain, guidelines for the prevention and control of legionnaires\u00b4disease (LD) have existed since the 1980's. Some of these guidelineshave been developed by the health authorities in the tourist areas andare specifically targeted at the prevention of the illness in the ac-commodation sites. In 2003, national law was passed in Spain (2) that targeted installations that could be possible sources of infection andwhich included both preventive and control measures should casesor outbreaks appear. MethodsInformation received through EWGLINET, whose functions have been described elsewhere (3), and notifications of cases and clustersof legionellosis received by the National Epidemiology Centre (NEC)through the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (NESN)have been analysed. Reporting of legionnaires' disease by physiciansis mandatory in Spain . The NESN gathers, on a weekly basis, anycases of legionnaires' diagnosed and reported by physicians, ac-companied by a minimum dataset that includes demographic, clin- ical and epidemiological information about the case. When a clusteror outbreak occurs, the health authorities of the affected regionsend the NEC a report which includes a summary of the epidemi-ological and environmental investigation carried out. Spain has adopted the 2001 definitions of cluster and sporadic cases (4) and the procedures for the notification and follow-up of clustersin foreign travellers set down by the EWGLINET Guidelines for thePrevention and Control of Legionellosis (5). Travel is defined as stay- ing away from home for one or more nights in accommodation suchas hotels, campsites etc., in the 10 days before the onset of illness. In this paper, the combined analysis of the clusters associated with travel, including foreign cases as well as national travellers from the year 2001 to the end of July 2003, is presented. ResultsFrom January 2001 to July 2003, 46 clusters were notified and 135 people were affected; 74 were foreign travellers and 61 were Spanish( TABLE). Twenty six out of the 46 clusters included only foreign citizens, 14 included Spanish and six had cases of both origins. Fifty cases werecitizens of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Sweden. Thesecases accounted for 69% (51 out of 74) of cases of foreign origin. The mean age was 62 years (ranging from 25 to 89). No differ- ences were observed between foreign and national travellers in thisrespect. The male-female ratio was 2.4/1 in nationals and 3.3/1 in 1. National Centre for Epidemiology.

All but 11 cases were diagnosed by urinary anti- gen test. Four cases were diagnosed by culture. Seven cases wereprobable cases. Ten deaths were recorded, however the outcome information was not available for 76 (56.3%) cases. The case fatality rate washigher for those who stayed in Apartments or Apart-hotels, but thenumbers are too small to draw any conclusion. The clusters detected were small, ranging in size from two or three cases (37 out of the 46 clusters) to eight cases (2 out of the 46).Most clusters were related to hotels (31 out of 46). Clusters at other accommodation sites were less frequent: seven clusters were relatedto apartments, three to campsites and five to spa resorts. Only Spanish people were affected in these spa resorts due to the factthat these are not located in tourist areas. The mean length of stayin the accommodation sites was 8.5 days (0 to 61 days). This figurewas 9.1 days for foreigners (1 to 61 days) and 7.3 days for Spanish(1 to 23 days). Regarding the duration of the cluster (time betweenthe first and the last case notified) this was less than six months in20 of the clusters (43.5%). The mean time between the onset and notification by EWG- LINET for the clusters of foreign travellers was 47 days (range wasfrom 7 to 450 days). A reduction in this mean time was observed in2003 compared to 2001 (26 days versus 65). Accommodation sites related to the clusters are located on the mainland Mediterranean coast and the Spanish islands of theMediterranean and Atlantic ( FIGURE ). Clusters associated with both foreign and Spanish travellers demonstrated a similar location pat-tern.Only eight clusters were located outside of the main Spanish tourist areas. The microbiological results of the environmental investigation were positive for 25 clusters (54% of the total). The reports stated that the microorganism was L. pneumophila serogroup 1 for thirteen of these positive results. No differences were observed in the per-centage of positive results between clusters that lasted less than six months and longer clusters. No differences were observed in this re-gard when comparing clusters of foreigners to those including onlySpanish travellers. With respect to size, in those clusters with two orthree cases, the percentage of positive results was approximately50%. All results were positive in those clusters which had four casesor more except in one cluster of eight cases. However,only detailed information about the inspection car- ried out at the accommodation site for 25 clusters was received. The most frequent deficiencies were related to incorrect temperatures,both in cold and hot water systems, followed by inadequate chlori-nation. In one hotel the guests were moved out. DiscussionThe adoption in January 2001 of the new definition for clusters signified an increase of 37% (17 out of 46) in the number of travelassociated clusters related to Spain. In addition, the introduction ofnew procedures in July 2002 has resulted in a significant increase inthe burden of work at all levels in the process of notification, in-vestigation and control. However, these changes have been adopted smoothly by the Spanish health authorities. Up to the present, EWG-LINET forms A and B have been sent in promptly for all the ac-commodation sites inspected and all the sites have complied satisfactorily with the control measures required by the environ-mental health officers. One limitation observed was that Spanish regional health au- thorities have replaced the previous more comprehensive reports ofthe environmental results of the investigation with just the forms Aand B. This change has caused a significant loss of information. The difference between the number of clusters of Spanish and for- eign travellers may be accounted for by the type of holidays and ac-commodation sites used. No other major differences were observed. The small number of clusters associated with campsites merits fur-ther investigation. It is worthy of mention that 13 clusters 40.6% (13 out of 32) were composed of citizens of different countries and that these clus- ters would never have been identified without the work of EWG- LINET. Also, the improvement in the reduction of the time delayfor notification has to be mentioned. The increasing use of the urinary antigen test has impaired the possibility of comparing clinical and environmental isolates. Aweakness in the EWGLINET procedures, which could be con- sidered for future modifications, is the limited epidemiologicalinformation that is presently collected. More detailed informa-tion related to risk exposure would help with the investigationof clusters in the country of origin of the infection. References 1. Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica.

These laboratories serve 221 hospitals and the general prac-titioners in the corresponding geographical areas. The reporting lab-oratory completes a form describing the type of infection, the affectedunit in cases of nosocomial infection (clinical discipline), and his-tory with regard to previous stay in hospitals or long-term care facil- ities, and sends this to the reference centre with the staphylococcalisolate. The reference centre then performs typing on the isolate(phage typing for a first grouping followed by SmaI-macrorestric- tion patterns (for details see [15])). All isolates are also subjected tosusceptibility testing by microbroth MIC (16). MRSA exhibiting SmaI-macrorestriction patterns which are different from those of the knownepidemic MRSA in central Europe (15) are furthermore characterisedby spa sequence typing (www.ridom.de) and MLST-typing (www.saureus.mlst.net). They are also subjected to PCR detection ofresistance genes ([17] and for the lukS-lukFdeterminant (coding for Panton-Valentine Leukocidin), primers according to reference 1 were used. The speci- ficity of this PCR was confirmed by sequencing (correspondence withsequence in gene bank accession no. X72700, methodology for se-quencing as described previously [20]). ResultsStrain characteristics MRSA possessing lukS-lukFisolates exhibited a unique Sma I- macrorestriction pattern that corresponds to patterns shown for theFrench, Scottish and Norwegian c-MRSA. They exhibit MLST-type 80 and a unique sequence r23, r12, r34, r34, r33, is strikingly different from those of epidemicMRSA prevalent in central European hospitals (F IGURE 1). Geographical regions and times of occurrence are shown in figure 2. The isolates ex- hibited resistance to oxacillin mg/l (PCR demon- strated resistance genes in brackets). Emergence in hospitals and in the community The strain obviously emerged in the second half of 2002, and was sent for typing from sporadic infections in nine German hospitals indifferent geographical regions. Of these isolates, five were from woundinfections in surgery, medicine and dermatology, one from septi-caemia, one from pneumonia and two from colonisation (one nose,one skin) in dermatological patients. None of these patients had hada previous stay in a hospital or a long-term care facility. Between December 2002 and June 2003, four cases of skin infec- tions with this strain in patients without previous hospitalisationhave been recorded in different geographical areas of Germany. Patient1 was a child in an Arab family living in Germany. The child had a skinabscess, and varicella superinfection. Patient 2 was a woman who divided her time between Egypt and Germany who had multiple skinabscesses. Patient 3 was a child in Greek family living in Germany.Analysis ofcommunity-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (c-MRSA) from Germany producing the Panton-Valentine leukocidin revealed a unique SmaI-macrore- striction pattern, different from epidemic nosocomial strains. This molecular pattern corresponds to those shown in c-MRSAstrains from other cou ntries in the European Union. All isolates exhibited resistance to fusidic acid, which is coded by the far- 1 gene. From data on geographical dissemination and time of oc-currence, this strain appears to have emerged in Germany in thesecond half of 2002, and so an alre ady wider dissemination is likely. The emergence of MRSA with resistance to fusidic acid is a first sign of the emergence of a PVL-positive MRSA clone. Euro Surveill 2004;9(1):16-8 Published words : Staphylococci, MRSA, Panton-Valentine leukocidin Introduction The majority of Staphylococcus aureus isolates from deep skin in- fections, particularly furunculosis, and also from community-acquirednecrotising pneumonia, possess the for Panton-ValentineLeukocidin ( lukS-lukF; 1, 2). True community-acquired methicillin- resistant S. aureus (c-MRSA) described up to now has often been iso- lated from skin infections and possess lukS-lukF(3, 4, 5) c-MRSA. Since the first reports (6), c-MRSA has spread further in North America, andhas caused outbreaks of skin infections in the community and in prisoninmates (7, 8). The North American c-MRSA exhibits characteristicpatterns of molecular typing, and possesses a SCC-mec element of typeIV and the lukS-lukF-determinant (9). Community-acquired MRSA has been also reported from Australia (10). As indicated by MLST typing, c-MRSA from Australia is differ-ent from the North American strain although it also possesses SCC-mec IV and lukS-lukF(9). The first data on true c-MRSA in Europe came from Finland where three different strains were recorded (11). Later in 2002, a French studydescribed 14 cases of c-MRSA infection, including several cases offurunculosis and two fatal cases of pneumonia (4). Six of the patients lived in Lyon, two in Algeria, and the rest in other French cities. The14 isolates exhibited a unique pattern of characteristics with regard toSmaI-macrorestriction analysis, possessed lukS-lukF,and were resist- ant to exhibiting the same SmaI-macrorestriction pattern has been observed amongMRSA from sporadic nosocomial infections in the Netherlands (12).c-MRSA with comparable SmaI-patterns have also been detected inNorway (13) and Scotland, with demonstration of lukS-lukF(14). In this paper, we report the emergence of lukS-lukF-positive MRSA in hospitals and in the community in Germany. *National Reference Centre for Staphylococci, Robert Koch-Institut, Wernigerode, Issue w w w .eurosurveillance.org 17The child had impetigo, and skin abscesses had been seen in three other family members, although microbiological diagnostics had not beencarried out on these three members. Patient 4 had a whitlow on onefinger, which had obviously been acquired in Russia. PVL-positive and fusidic acid-resistant MRSA had been iso- lated from patients in different, unrelated hospitals, we cannot ex-clude an already wider dissemination. As no PVL-negative MRSAexhibiting the same SmaI-macrorestriction pattern as the PVL-pos- itive clone had previously been seen in S. aureus sent in for typing since 1994, and as this pattern is clearly different from patterns of methi-cillin-susceptible strains from cases of furunculosis (n = 26), acqui-sition of lukS-lukFby a pre-existing MRSA or of the mecA gene by a PVL-positive strain can be excluded. It is likely that the strain alreadyknown from France, Scotland, Finland, and probably Norway is wide-spread. No previous hospitalisation was known for the four outpatientsaffected. Whether the strain could have been acquired by family as-sociation with the Mediterranean area, as has been discussed forFrench community-acquired MRSA (4), needs to be established. Of particular interest is resistance to fusidic acid encoded by the far1-gene in the MRSA strain described here. PCR for lukS-lukFi s not generally performed in primary bacteriological diagnostics. Asresistance to fusidic acid is quite rare in MRSA from central Europe (~3%; 22), the emergence of MRSA with fusidic acid resistance is afirst signal for the emergence of the PVL-positive MRSA clone. Another aspect is the therapeutic use of fusidic acid. T opical fusidic acid is used in dermatology for treatment of impetigo, atopical dermatitisand acne. Although short-term treatment seems not to have an influ-ence on fusidic acid resistance rates in S. aureus (23), the possibility that topical fusidic acid may be driving selection and dissemination ofPVL-positive, fusidic acid resistant MRSA should be watched closely References Prevost G, Couppie al.

However,written reports were not mandatory and had no standard format. Foodborne outbreaks (FBO) were not reportable events although some individual cases were due to causative agents that were part ofthe list of statutory reportable diseases (Doen\u00e7\u00e3s de de Alerta e RespostaApropriada (SARA). DSCs were given the responsibility to report FBOs to regional health authorities and a standard report form wasproposed (2). Having adapted this for Portugal, the northern regionalhealth authority (Delegado Regional de Sa\u00fade do Norte - DRSN)created a formal surveillance programme of FBOs. This report briefly describes data generated from this programme, in the first year of its existence, in the northern health region (Regi\u00e3ode Sa\u00fade do Norte) (3.23 million inhabitants) in Portugal.In October 2001, foodborne outbreaks (FBO) were included in the Portuguese alert and response surveillance system. Accordingly,the northern regional health authority (Delegado Regional de Sa\u00fade do Norte - DRSN) began a surveillance programme of foodborne outbreaks. This report is a brief description of data generated from this programme in 2002. For each foodborne out- break the local health authority (Delegado de Sa\u00fade Concelhio - DSC) produced a written report. Fifty-nine percent of the 27FBOs studied by DSCs during 2002 were reported within 72hours after the date of onset. Five hundred and seventy sevenpeople became ill, 9.6% of the patients were admitted to hos-pital, and no deaths were reported. The aetiological agent wasidentified from patients in 63% of FBOs, and in food items in 18.5% of the situations. Salmonella enterica was respon sible for 73.7% of the outbreaks in which the agent was laboratory con- firmed. Meals implicated in the outbreak were mainly prepared in restaurants and private homes (75.0% of FBO). Inadequate pro- cessing, preparing or handling of foods were the contributing factors more often reported by the DSC. We believe that epi- demiological surveillance and control of FBO must be reinforcedin Portugal as part of a wider strategy to promote food safety. 1 Centro Regional de Sa\u00fade P\u00fablica do Norte, Portugal 2 Delega\u00e7\u00e3o no Porto do Instituto Nacional de Sa\u00fade Dr. Ricardo Jorge, Portugal>>> 8.

A preliminary assessment was then made in orderto confirm that a FBO had occurred. As part of the above mentioned programme, when a DSC (at the municipal level) knew of a FBO,they reported it to the DRSN. That report was first made by phone andletter in a specific written format. Some FBOs were detected initiallyby the DRSN, who then contacted the DSC. The DRSN provided technical advice and guidance in the discussions with a DSC investi- gating an outbreak. Ultimately, the DSC was the coordinator of eachoutbreak investigation, except when outbreaks involved several mu-nicipalities, in which case coordination was by the DRSN. For each out-break, a final written report was produced. After analysis of eachreport, feedback was provided to the DSC in the region concerned. These reports are the source of the data described here. Information was recorded, processed and analysed, using Epi Info 6.04 (3). We describe here data concerning operational issues of the pro- gramme and some epidemiological aspects of foodborne outbreaks in northern Portugal in 2002. ResultsTwenty seven FBOs were studied by DSCs and/or the DRSN, dur- ing 2002. Initial information concerning cases of a suspected FBOwas provided by different entities: hospitals (16/27), senior staff mem-bers of institutions where the FBO had occurred (4/27), DDO (4/27)and other sources (3/27). The proportion of index cases reportedwithin 72 hours, one week and two weeks after the date of onset were respectively 59% (16/27), 74% (20/27) and 100% (27/27) of the out- breaks (F IGURE 1).In one of the reports, no data was given concerning the number of persons affected. In 26 FBOs, 577 people became ill, resulting in an es-timated incidence rate of 17.9 per 100 000, in northern Portugal. Thesize of the outbreaks varied from a minimum of one case (botulism)to a maximum of 154 cases (mean number of persons per outbreak: 22.2). Forty seven per cent of patients were between 15 and 59 yearsold, 30% were less than 15 years and 23% were more than 59 years old.Nine point six per cent of the patients were admitted to hospital. No deaths were reported. Whenever available, suspected food items were analysed in the laboratory, in order to identify the agent and the vehicle of infection.Thirty five food item samples, from 44.4% (12/27) of the outbreaks,were sent to be analysed. Laboratory investigations which aimed to iso- late aetiological agents were performed among patients in 81.5%FBOs (22/27) (T ABLE 1). As a result, the aetiological agent was iden- tified from patients in 63.0% (17/27) and from food items from 18.5%(5/27) of FBOs. In three FBOs there laboratory evidence was ob-tained from both patients and food items (T ABLE 1). Combining laboratory evidence from patients and food items (TABLE 1 and 2) it was possible to isolate a putative agent in 70.4% of outbreaks (19/27), while aetiology was unknown in 22.2% (6/27).Based on clinical and epidemiological data it was possible presumea causative agent in 7.4% (2/27) of the FBOs studied (T ABLE 2). In the FBOs in which laboratory results were negative both in patients andfood items, it was suspected, based on epidemiological and clinical data,that the aetiological agent was Norovirus (T ABLES 1 and 2). In one of the two FBO for which no laboratory analyses were performed at all(T ABLE 1), the aetiological agent (diarrhoeic shellfish poisoning toxin) and the vehicle (shellfish) were presumed based on clinical and epi-demiological data (T ABLE 2). For those in which the aetiology was confirmed, Salmonella enterica was responsible for 73.7% (14/19) of the outbreaks and for 80.6%(286/355) of the cases (T ABLE 2). Serovar Enteritidis was identified in 4 of the 14 outbreaks, and phage types 1 (PT1) and 4 (PT4) werefound in two of those four outbreaks. Based on epidemiological evidence (results from the analysis of questionnaires), raw eggs and foods containing raw egg were identi-fied as the vehicle in 8 of the 27 outbreaks, followed by meat andmeat products (3/27), fish products (2/27), smoked raw ham (2/27),shellfish (2/27) and drinking water (1/27).Isolation in patients Total Yes No Not done Isolation in food itemsYes 3 1 1 5 No 4 1 2 7 Not done 10 3 2 15 Total 17 5 5 2700123456789 12345678 91 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4Number of outbreaks Interval in daysFIGURE 1 Delay between the occurrence of the index case and the reporting to Health Authorities.

Northern Portugal - 2002Surveillance report 20 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 1-3 In 24 FBOs it was possible to know the place where the meals had been prepared. In most cases (41.7%, 10/24) meals were prepared in restaurants, followed by private homes (33.3%: 8/24) and canteens (25.0%: 6/24). Thirty one contributing factors were reported by DSCs, in 13 of the 27 FBOs. Inadequate processing, preparing or handling of food werefactors more often (7/31) reported, followed by contamination ofdrinking water (5/31), use of contaminated raw material (5/31), prepa-ration of food items too far in advance (4/31), contamination by per- sonnel (3/31) and inadequate cooking (3/31). In 18 of the 27 reports (T ABLE 3) we had information about the con- trol measures implemented by DSCs in order to prevent further FBOs. Besides health services, other state departments, with responsibilitiesin the areas of environment and economy were contacted by DSCs tobe involved in the control measures, in sixteen FBOs. Discussion2002 was the first year of the surveillance programme of food- borne outbreaks in northern Portugal. Because of this, the number ofFBOs studied was small and data was missing for some variables andobservations and thus conclusions drawn from this study must becautiously interpreted because of potential biases. In this review, declaration of FBOs to health authorities were made sooner than in a published study in France (4), in which 48% and 68%of FBOs were reported to Health Authorities within three and sevendays after onset respectively. We question if timeliness was influenced by the fact that 2002 was the first year of the programme. Our main source of declaration were hospital doctors (59%), a higher valuethan reported in France (28%) (4). Reasons for this difference arenot apparent. The estimated incidence rate of foodborne disease in northern Portugal (17.9/100000) was between the extremes of European values observed in 1998 (the Russian Federation (3/100 000) and Yugoslavia(219/100 000)) (5). It is believed that only 10% of FBOs in industri-alised countries (6) are reported, but no data are available to estimatethe level of underreporting in our study. The average number of persons per outbreak in this study (22.2) was higher than that estimated from data reported by the WorldHealth Organization between 1993 and 1998 (11.7) (5). The high value found in this study was influenced by the size of one of the out-breaks (n=154) and possibly by under-reporting of smaller size out-breaks. The proportion of patients hospitalised as a consequence of a foodborne disease in this report (9.6%) is similar to the value re-ported in France in 2001 (10%) (4). But, unlike the French study, nodeaths were reported among cases of foodborne disease in our caseseries. These differences must be interpreted with caution, because thisstudy included a smaller number of cases and other data must beavailable to make a proper comparison of severity among countries. The aetiological agent was unknown in 22.2% of the FBOs stud- ied, which is between the values of 17% and 29.3% found in other stud-ies (T ABLE 4). Comparison with FBOs in France, in 2001 (4), the agent was confirmed in a higher proportion of outbreaks, and presumed ina lower proportion of FBOs (T ABLE 4). As in other studies (4,5) Salmonella enterica was the most common isolated agent (7), and raw eggs and raw egg-containing foods were found to be important vehicles of agents of FBOs. Foodborne outbreaks originating from meals prepared at home (33.3%) were less common than in similar studies in Europeancountries (4,5).Based on this first year of experience we believe that epidemio- logical surveillance and control of foodborne disease outbreaks mustbe pursued and reinforced in Portugal. The type of program de-scribed here is one of the important activities of a wider strategy topromote food safety (8).

EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 1-3 / w w w .eurosurveillance.org 21On 3 September 2002, the Spanish national centre of epidemi- ology (Centro Nacional de Epidemiolog\u00eda - CNE) were alerted to a high number of amoebiasis cases in Spanish tourists re- turning from a hotel in a holiday resort in the DominicanRepublic. The cases were in patients who had travelled to thehotel on different days during the previous month. Entamoeba hystolitica cysts were visualised by stool microscopy in the stools of several patients who had sought medical attention in the Dominican Republic. The CNE informed the health authorities in the DominicanRepublic and conducted an epidemiological investigation in con-juction with them and seven Spanish regional epidemiologyservices, because the cases were distributed throughout Spain. A descriptive study of the 76 cases initially found that themean duration of the illness was 5.1 \u00b12.9 days and the exposure period was 3.6 \u00b12.2 days.Following a retrospective cohort study, the attack rate wasfound to be 32.4% (95% CI=114.75-317 .25). It is estimated that 216 Spanish tourists probably developed the illness.Stool sample s were coll ected in Spain from patients who still felt un well, and these were analysed by direct microscopy, cul- ture and ELISA. None of the samples were found to be positiveforEntamoeba hystolitica . On 10 September, a hygiene inspection took place at the im-plicated hotel. A risk assessment of the water distribution system and laboratory testing of water and several food sam- ples were undertaken by the local he alth authorit ies in the Dominican Republic.Consumption of water from the resort water system was the onlyrisk factor associated with the presence of symptoms (RR= 3.55;95% CI =1.13-10.99). To avoid similar outbreaks occurring again at the hotel, it is essentia l to ensure the use of safe drinking water, to implement measures to regularly monitor th e water quality and to improve food handling hygiene standards. Basic food hygiene training for food handlers should be mandatory. An international guideline for the management foodborne andwaterborne outbreaks among tourists in holiday resorts should be drawn up, involving all competent authorities of both des-tination and touri st origin countriesEuro Surveill 2004;9(3):21-3 Published online Mar 2004 Key words : Waterborne diseas e, Spain, Dominican Republic, travel, Entamoeba hystolitica Introduction Gastrointestinal infections are regarded as the commonest travel associated illnesses. Despite the high incidence of water and food-borne disease in travellers, the majority of outbreaks in tourists are notdetected by the communicable disease surveillance programmes in thetourists' countries of origin (1), nor are they detected by the regional health authorities where the implicated holidays resorts are located. On 3 September 2002, a high number of complaints of illness in tourists returning from holidays in the Dominican Republic was no- tified to the Centro Nacional de Epidemiolog\u00eda (Spanish NationalCentre of Epidemiology, CNE) by a regional Spanish epidemiologyservice (the Servicio de Epidemiolog\u00eda de Asturias). Seventy six cases were initially i dentified in patients who had all stayed at the same hotel, on an all inclusive package holiday (with allmeals and beverages at the hotel included). Patients had travelled toand from the holiday resort on different days on August 2002.Entamoeba hystolitica cysts were identified by stool microscopy in samples from several patients who sought medical attention in theDominican Republic. The CNE informed the health authorities in the Dominican Republic. The outbreak had not previously been notified by the medical service where the patients received medical care in theDominican Republic. Epidemiological investigationA preliminary investigation was conducted in conjunction with the health authorities in the Dominican Republic and seven Spanishregional epidemiology services (Asturias, Castilla La Mancha), since there were cases from almost all over Spain. Regional authorities interviewed the 76 patientsinitially identified as suspect cases, using a specifically designed ques-tionnaire. Patients were asked by telephone about relevant clinicalfeatures (when and how the illness bega n, stool characteristics, asso- ciated symptoms and their frequency and characteristics) and po-tential risk factors (consumption of unsafe foods, swimming in or drinking untreated fresh water, contact with other ill patients, recentor regular medication, underlying medical condition)(2). They werealso advised to seek medical attention if they still felt unwell, and en-couraged to provide clinical samples. The Dominican Republic health authorities reviewed all medical histories from the hotel's medical service and the reference clinic,22 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 1-3 looking for patients with a diagnosis of diarrhoea or gastroenteritis between 5 to 17 August. On 10 September, they undertook an envi-ronmental investigation of the implicated hotel, including a hygiene inspection, risk assessment of the water distribution system, and lab-oratory testing of water and several food samples. The CNE carried out a retrospective cohort study to determine the magnitude of the event and to establish risk factors for develop-ment of illness. Taking into account the results of the initial descrip-tive study, the epidemic period was defined as being from 2 to 14August 2002. A probable case was defined as a person who had visited the hotel during the epidemic period and developed diarrhoea (threeor more loose stools per day) and abdominal pain plus one of the fol-lowing symptoms: vomiting, fever and chills. ResultsInitial study The 76 cases identified were interviewed. The mean age was 31.6 \u00b13.5 years. 61.8% of cases were male. Symptoms included diarrhoea(96%), pain vomiting duration of the illness was 5.1 \u00b12.9 days. Two cases were admitted to hospital within 24 hours of onset of symptoms. The temporal distribution of cases according to arrival date at the resort is shown in the figure. This epidemic curve, which is clustered around a peak on 10 August 2002 (onset of symptoms for the mediancase), points to a common source of infection. However, after thepeak, the curve shows a different pattern that could be the result of themaintenance of the infection source or a different exposure source.No relation was found between patients' arrival date at the hotel and their onset of symptoms; nor was one found between durationof stay and presence of symptoms. However, since the incubationperiod could not be estimated (the appearance date of the infectionsource and the aetiology were unknown), a mean exposure period of3.6\u00b12.2 days was calculated with the assumption that the hotel wasthe source of exposure. Patients ate exclusively at the different restaurants in the hotel, because they had chosen an all-inclusive holiday package, and therewere no urban facilities close to the hotel. They all consumed tap water and ice from the hotel's private well. There was no other untreated fresh water source (such as a lake or a stream) close to the resort Ninety four point two per cent of the pa-tients had swum in the resort's swimming pool. Cases had neither travelled to other developing countries in the pre- vious two months before the date of arrival at the hotel, nor had they experienced gastroenteritis during the previous week. Seven patients had chronic pathologies and were taking prescribed medicines beforeand during their stay at the hotel. None of these underlying medicalconditions has been described as able to influence susceptibility to gas- trointestinal illness. The Dominican Republic health authorities report highlighted the fact that holidaymakers from other European countries and theUnited States had also been affected. The estimated attack rate of acute diarrhoea in hotel guests who sought medical attention was5.3 times higher in August than in July (2.1% in July, 11.2% in August).Among the 700 hotel's employees, there were no cases in July but nine people sought medical attention during the epidemic period inAugust: the attack rate for employees was 1.3%. Analytical studyThe CNE requested the list of reservations for the holiday resort from 2 to 14 August 2002 from the tour operator. The tour operatoragreed to supply this information after receiving a legal request fromthe Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Protecci\u00f3n de Datos (Spanish agency fordata protection). The list was provided on 22 December 2002, fourmonths after detection of the outbreak. Six hundred and seventy five people from Spain stayed at the ho- tel during that period. Contact telephone numbers for these tourists were not available, and taking into consideration the costs that would have been involved in contacting them and the period of time that hadalready passed, a 5% sample was randomly selected out of the cohort:37 cohort members were interviewed. Twelve cases were reported. Consequently, the estimated attack rate was 32% and it was estimated that 216 Spanish tourists proba- bly developed the illness (95% CI=114.75-317.25). The mean age of cases was 34.7\u00b13.4 years.The epidemic curve of the cohort is represented in the figure, where cases are represented as blue squares. Water consumption from the resort's water system was the only risk factor associated with the presence of symptoms (T ABLE ): the water from the water supply was not present in juices or other soft drinks,but it was served in jugs in all restaurants during meals. People whodrank this water from the jugs had a 3.55 times greater risk for de-veloping the (RR= valueill healthy total ill healthy Total Jug water served during meals 9 8 15 3 17 20 3,55 (1,13-10,9) 0,03 Sodas el aborated with tap water 11 21 32 1 4 5 2,29 (0,3-11,11) 0,83 Ice (made from tap water) 10 16 26 2 9 11 2,12 (0,55-8,12) 0,41TABLE Association measures of the studied risk factors.

The resort is served by a single water distribution system with a pri- vate well. The risk assessment identified a faulty connection of thesewage system to the water supply system related to the works inprogress as a possible outbreak source. The water from the private well is supposed to be regularly chlo- rinated (employees were reluctant to show the registers to the sani- tary inspectors) but is not filtered. Bacterial cultures of water samplesfrom kitchen taps and the water system supply were negative. Samplestaken from the ice and meals (green salad, noodle salads, salmon,scrambled eggs, soft cheese and milk pudding) served at the buffeton that day yielded anaerobic mesophile microorganism and col-iform bacteria. On or around 14 August, the hotel partially shut down the water distribution system and began to serve bottled water and commerciallyprepared ice. In Spain, 51 patients submitted stool samples that were analysed by direct microscopy, cultured and by antigen detection (ELISA). Different enteropathogens were identified in the clinical samples ofthree cases : Giardia lamblia in one case, Ecchinoccocus in one case, and both Salmonella enterica and Aeromonas hydrophila in one case. These specimens were collected two weeks after the patients' return from theDominican Republic. There were no positive findings of Entamoeba hysto litica . DiscussionWaterborne outbreak classification criteria by Tillett et al (3), give epidemiological evidence precedence over water quality data. In thisinvestigation, the microbiological agent could not be detected in theanalysed samples but the epidemiological analysis suggests the out-break was probably associated with water consumption from the ho-tel's priv ate well. This outbreak investigation was triggered by complaints from pa- tients several days after their return from holiday. The delay in therecognition of the outbreak may have affected the probability of de- tecting the aetiological agent in clinical specimens and in water sam- ples. Consequently, the microbiological findings should be consideredwith caution. Several limitations must be taken into account in order to bet- ter interpret the epidemiological evidence. The initial alert sug- gested a large outbreak confined to holidaymakers. However, neitherthe magnitude nor the aetiology of the outbreak were clear. The re-turning tourists were very alarmed, because E. hystolytica cysts were visualized in four patients' stool samples in the Dominican Republic. Recall and misclassification bias could have affected the results of the study, leading to an overestimate of the number of ill persons. Due to the high attack rate of the illness, it was difficult to find adequate controls, and therefore a cohort study was designed.Nevertheless, it took over three months to obtain cohort informa- tion. The tour operator agreed to give the list of reservations dur-ing the study period only after a legal request by the Spanish dataprotection agency. With a sample size of 37 persons, the power of the relative risk measure is considerably inferior than 80% at a 95% confidencelevel. However, the association is strong, statistically significant, andstable (regarding the width of the confidence interval). E. hystolitica was not detected in stool samples analysed at the Spanish reference centre. This could be explained if the cysts iden-tified in the Dominican Republic were E. dispar (morphologically identical to E. histolytica but non-pathogenic and also endemic in the region) (4-6), and the illness was caused by other pathogens. The mean exposure period of three days seems too short to be explained by protozoa, but compatible with multiple microbial agents from a faecal contamination. If the hypothesis of a punctualcontamination of the water system supply is true, the incubation pe- riod must be even shorter than three days according to figure 1. The presence of anaerobic mesophile bacteria in the food items evidences a general lack of hygiene during food handling (7). Cross-contamination cannot be excluded. However, the risk as- sessment indicates a contamination in the water system supplydue to the works in progress as the most probable outbreak origin.Around 14 August, the hotel partially shut down the water distri- bution system and began to serve bottled water and commerciallyprepared ice. No further cases ocurred after that date, even thoughnew tourists arrived at the hotel every day. The investigation of this outbreak was made possible thanks to the efficient transfer of information between the health authorities inthe Dominican Republic and Spain. However, it was not begun untilsome time after the end of the outbreak. Since foodborne and water-borne outbreaks among travellers visiting the Dominican Republic arecommon (8), and given the willingness of the Dominican Republic au- thorities to cooperate in the investigat ion, there is clearly a need to de- fine an international policy to implement surveillance measures thatcan promptly detect this kind of outbreak (9). Recommen dations 1. To avoid similar future outbreaks in the implicated hotel, it is essential T o ensure th e use of safe drinking water for direct human consumption and forfood preparation in the hotel, and to implement measures to monitor the water qua lity exhaustively; To improve hygiene standards for food handling, especially refrigeration (4\u00baC) up unti l time of consumption. Basic food hygiene training for food handlers should be guaranteed and training sessions should be repeated regularly because of the large staff turnover operating in the resort. 2. To detect promptly and manage efficiently gastroenteritis outbreaks in tourists, it would be useful to define international guidelines involving all the competent authorities: ministers of health and tourism and local health departments of both destination and tourist origin countries. Acknowledgment s The collaboration of the regional epidemiology services has been crucial to the success of the investigation, since they were in chargeof int erviewing all ca ses. We especially recognize the quality of the work and appreciate the interest of: Natalia Corripio from the National Centre of Microbiology coordinated theanalysis of the stool specimens. References 1.

At the same time Italy reported anoutbreak (200+ cases) associated with oysters from the Etang de Thau. An investigation was carried out to determine thesource and vehicle of the outbreaks. Descriptive analysis of reported clusters in France, microbio-logical analysis of stool and oyster samples, genotyping ofnoroviruses and an environmental investigation of the Etang de Thau were carried out. A retrospective cohort study wasalso unde rtaken among those attending a number of family meals in Paris. Thirteen family clusters in four districts of France (69 cases)could be attributed to the consumption of Thau oysters based on descriptive evidence. Oysters distributed at an office in Paris and consumed at fourteen family meals between 19 and 24 December led to a further outbreak. In this outbreak the at- tack rate was 21/36 (58%) for Thau oyster consumers and 0/22 for non-consumers (genogroups I and II) were found in stool samp les from four clusters and oysters from three clusters (including Paris). Environmental investiga- tions revealed heavy rainfall, an overflow of a water purifi- cation station and faecal cont amination of the Etang Thau in December. Oysters from the Etang de Thau were responsible for a numberof clusters of norovirus GE in winter 2002 in France and also in Italy. High Escheric hia Colilevels in Thau water and shell- fish led to an official request, mid-December, for oyster pu- rification before distribution. This was not possible, due tolack ofpurification facilities. This investigation has contributed to a change in the way that shellfish harv esting area s are clas- sified in France. Euro Surveill 2004;9(3):24-6 Published online Mar 2004 Key words : Foodborne disease, norovirus, Escheric hia Coli Introduction Viruses have emerged as an important cause of food and waterborne diseases in recent years with numerous outbreaks associated withnoroviruses. These viruses belong to the genus Norovirus ,family Caliciviridae (previously Norwalk-like) and cause acute gastroenteri- tis in humans. Transmission is primarily via the faecal-oral route. Wedescribe a foodborne outbreak linked to the consumption of oysters. In January 2003, the Institut de Veille Sanitaire (InVS) became aware of a number of foodborne outbreaks thought to be due to the consumption of oysters from the Etang de Thau (literally, the Thau pond) in December 2002. Several districts had notified such out-breaks. The Etang de Thau is located in the south of France and hasseven shellfish farming sites. At the same time, the Rapid Alert systemfor food and feed (1) reported over 200 cases of acute gastroenteritisin Italy that were linked to the consumption of oysters from the samearea of France. In order to confirm the role of oysters from the Etangde Thau in these outbreaks and the source of their contamination, anepidemiological investigation of one of these outbreaks was carriedout. This had taken place among staff of an administrative office inParis and their relatives. The investigation was supplemented by analy- sis of data on all notified foodborne outbreaks attributed to the con-sumption of oysters in other French districts from December 2002 to January 2003. MethodsEpidemiological investigation of the foodborne outbreak at the Paris administrative office. The oysters had been distributed to the staff on 19 December 2002, and taken home for personal consumption. A retrospective cohortstudy was carried out among all those present at the meals at whichthese oysters had been served. Cases were defined by the presence of at least one symptom within the 72 hours following the meal at which the oysters had been served: Definite case: diarrhoea and/or vomiting Probable case: fever or abdominal pains and/or nausea. A standardised questionnaire was completed for each participant in the study, either by face-to-face interview, telephone interview orby self-administered questionnaire. Demographic and clinical data were collected, as well as data on the other food items eaten during the meals at which the oysters were served. The association between oyster consumption and illness was esti- mated by calculation of the relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidenceinterval (CI95%) using Epi Info Version 6.EUROSURVEILLANCE / w w w .eurosurveillance.org 25Other reported foodborne outbreaks The notification of foodborne outbreaks is manda- tory in France. A foodborne outbreak is defined as the occurrence of at least two clustered cases with simi-lar symptoms and from the same suspected foodsource. All reported foodborne outbreaks are inves-tigated by local health authorities in order to identifythe food items and risk factors responsible. The char-acteristics of outbreaks (date of onset and type ofsymptoms, date of consumption and origin of the sus-pected food items) that had been reported to theInVS between 15 December 2002 and 15 January 2003 were described in order to evaluate the poten-tial role of oysters from the Etang de genuses by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, (RT-PCR)) were carried out on patients' stool samples. The oysters left over from themeals, were tested for noroviruses by genetic amplification using RT-PCR. Environmental investigations Pollution indicators at the oyster production sites (Etang de Thau) and meteorological events were examined. The sites where the con-sumed oysters originated were identified. ResultsEpidemiological investigation of the foodborne outbreak in the Paris office A total of 58 people from 14 families had been present at meals at which oysters from the Etang de Thau (Marseillan site) were served between 19 and 24 December 2002. The questionnaire was completedfor all 58 people (29 female and 29 male). The median age was 44.5years (range: 3- 88 years). Twenty one people (36%) from 11 families had been ill (19 defi- nite and 2 probable cases). The incubation period ranged from 3.5 to58 hours (median= 34 hours) (F IGURES 1 and 2). The most common clinical symptoms in the 21 cases were abdominal pain (76%) and di-arrhoea (76%), followed by nausea (62%), vomiting (43%), and fever(9.5%). The mean duration of illness was 1. 5 days (range: 1-3 days). Thirty six of the 58 participants had eaten raw oysters. Gastroenteritis was reported by 21 of these oyster consumers (attack rate 58%), andnone of the non-consumers (attack rate 0%) (p=2.10-5). The relativerisk was incalculable, and there was no statistically significant increase in risk with an increase in the number of oysters eaten. Apart from theoysters, no other common food item was identified. Other notified foodborne outbreaks Thirteen foodborne outbreaks were attributed to the consumption of oysters, resulting in 69 cases between 14 and 25 December 2002. Theseoutbreaks were reported to health authorities in four districts: H\u00e9rault,Ile de France, Aude and C\u00f4te d'Or. The incriminated oysters camefrom three production adjacent to the Etang de Thau: Bouzigues,Marseillan and M\u00e8ze. The main clinical signs diarrhoea (78%) and vomiting (64%).

TABLE Characteristics of noroviruses identified in foodborne outbreaks attributed to the consumption of oysters, France,December 2002number of cases26 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 1-3 Outbreak report oysters incriminated in the outbreaks came from three adjacent sites of the Etang de Thau. The identification of the same norovirus strain in oysters from two sites of the Etang de Thau reinforces the hypoth-esis that there was a common source of contamination. A foodborne or waterborne source has been identified in a num- ber of outbreaks of norovirus gastroenteritis (2). The epidemic po-tential of noroviruses is due to their principal reservoir being humans, faecal-oral transmission associated with a low infecting dose and theirsignificant persistence in the environment (3). In France, the con-sumption of oysters and other raw shellfish has already been impli-cated in several foodborne outbreaks of norovirus (4, 5). Following identification of bacterial contamination of the Thau pond and shellfish from the Thau pond, shell-fish farmers wereasked, by decree, to place their shellfish in purification basins. Thismeasure was only partially implemented due to a lack of purifica-tion facilities. There was no ban or withdrawal of the sale and con-sumption of batches of shellfish. Subsequently, there has been achange in the regulations for the classification of shellfish harvest- ing areas in France. Faced with the risk of overflowing water purification plants and hu- man faecal contamination of the Thau pond, the improvement andthe reinforcement of prevention measures at every level, from pro-duction to consumption should be a priority (6). However, in the ab-sence if specific indicators of viral contamination, consumers shouldbe informed of the risk of contracting certain diseases if they consumeraw or lightly cooked oysters. Finally, the Rapid Alert system for food and feed has shown its usefulness in the detection, in different mem-ber states, of foodborne outbreaks with a common source.

Three different strains were characterised in six patients : two strains belonging to genogroup II (Lordsdale geno-type and new variant GGIIb), and one (Chiba geno- type, Malta-like strain). The Lordsdale genotype was identified in stool samples of patients from three different foodborne outbreaks (T ABLE). Two different genogroups of noroviruses were detected in samples of oysters eaten in three of the outbreaks. The genogroup II strain(close to the H104-94-J strain) was found in oysters from the Marseillansite that were involved in the Paris outbreak, and in the oysters fromBouzigues involved in the Aude district outbreak. The Malta-like strain,characterised in one stool sample, was also identified in oysters from Bouzigues (T ABLE 1). For eight of the outbreaks, it was not possible to perform analyses on stool samples or oysters. Environmental investigations Following unusually heavy rainfall and floods on the 10 and 11 December 2002, waste water treatment plants and pumping stationswere reported to have overflowed onto the catchment area of the Etang de Thau. Analyses performed on three sites (Marseillan, Bouzigues and M\u00e8ze), between 16 and 19 December 2002 showedstrong contamination with Escherichia coli (between 2900 and 30 400 E. coli /100ml). Investigations carried out in the Etang de Thau area showed bacteriological contamination of shellfish. DiscussionResults of the epidemiological, microbiological and environmen- tal investigations carried out suggest that 14 norovirus foodborne out-breaks linked to the consumption of oysters from different areas of theEtang de Thau occurred in France between 14 and 25 December 2002. Foodborne outbreaks are considerably underreported in France and the true number of outbreaks that can be linked to the consumptionof oysters from the Etang de Thau is probably higher than the num-ber identified. Moreover, the simultaneous occurrence of cases ofacute gastroenteritis in Italy, linked to oysters from the same area,suggests that there could have been foodborne outbreaks in coun-tries importing oysters from this part of France. In Italy, 200 people had acute gastroenteritis after consuming oys- ters originating from the Meze site on 24 and 25 December 2002. A retrospective cohort study (n=124), carried out by the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 in Rome, found an association between the occurrence of gas-troenteritis and the consumption of oysters from the Etang in out of 41 stool samples analysed. TheSindlesham-like strain (Genogroup I) was characterised in two stool samples. Moreover, they identified the same Malta-like sequence as theone detected in the French oysters ( TABLE 1). Microbiological analy- ses carried out on oysters in Italy did not identify noroviruses. Three different strains of noroviruses (one identical to the strain identified in oysters in France and one identical to the strain identi-fied in stool samples in Italy) were identified in stool samples from pa-tients in France. These results, together with the identification of twoother strains, one in oysters in France and one in stool samples fromItaly, suggested that the oysters were multicontaminated by several dif- ferent genogroups. This does not detract from the potential implicatedrole of the oysters, as there is a wide range of circulating norovirus strains. Negative results following bacteriological analyses of patients' stool samples were available for only one foodborne outbreak. However, theincubation period and the type of symptoms of all the cases suggestsa viral aetiology; a bacterial aetiology is unlikely. The unusual rainfall and the flooding of waste water treatment plants were probably the source of contamination of the pond. TheTransmission is via person to person spread and fomites. Hands of healthcare personnel, medical devices (such as instruments used in eye examination) and products contaminated by adenoviruses have been implicated in the transmission within healthcare environments (6-10).Described adenoviral EKC outbreaks usually been in specific envi-ronments: hospitals, ophthalmology units, emergency services facil- ities, factories, schools, residences, and camps (5,6,7,8). Factorsassociated with community outbreaks are the use of pools, over-crowded conditions, poor hygiene rules , shared use of personal ob-jects and direct physical contact (4). Outbreak controlrecommendations are based on hand and general hygiene and ap- propriate disinfection of surfaces. Only one published study was found which analysed a community outbreak in Spain (11). Our report is the first in Spain to describe thespecific serotype identification and the diffusion of an EKC outbreakin a nursing home for the elderly (from December 2001 to March2002) in Leganes (south of Madrid). The identification of possible riskfactors associated with its occurrence and the assessment of the meas-ures adopted for its control are described. MethodsThe case definition used during the investigation is as follows: \"A resident or worker of the establishment having worked at least one day, or a relative of theirs who after 12 December 2001 and before 11 April2002, was identified with characterist ic subepithelial punctate keratitis by slit lamp ophthalmological examination or presented with redness ofthe eye with one or more of the following: photophobia, foreign bodysensation, discomfort, pain, decreased visual acuity or discharge, with a clinical course of longer than 24 hours\" . Description of the nursing home:The establishment concerned is an assisted nursing home with 220 residents located in Leganes (a city located south of Madrid). There are 3 floors divided into 11 modules (groupings of rooms). All therooms are singles, apart from 16 double rooms which are shared by married couples. There are both individual and shared use bath-rooms, depending on the structure of each module. The workforce con- sists of 140 workers: 96 care staff and 44 non-care staff. Epidemiological investigation of the outbreakClinical and epidemiological information were collected on all residents and workers using a specific questionnaire regardless of whether or not they were cases or not. The following variables werecollected: date of onset of symptoms, whether a resident or worker, floor and room number (residents), presence or absence of ability tomove around the building freely (referred to as autonomy (residents)),dependence type (residents), cognitive deterioration (residents), age,sex, symptoms, complications, referral, treatment and evolution.This work describes and analyses an outbreak of epidemic kerato conjunctivitis which occurred in 2001 and 2002 in a nurs- ing home for the elderly in Leganes (an area of Madrid). This is the first such pu blished case in Spain with these characteris- tics and this serotype identification. Sociodemographic characteristics, epidemic curve and attack rates are described. Comparisons of the data were carried out using a 2test forqualitative variable and t-test for quantita- tive. Factors associated with the illness are explored by means ofcontingency tables and logistic regression models. One hundred and two cases were detected, with an attack rateof36.4% for residents, and 12.9% for workers, not considering spa- tial or profess ional difference s. The epidemic curve showed an interpersonal transmission pattern. Multivariate analysis iden- tified the following risk factors in the residents: able to wan- der freely through the building, urinary incontinence and use ofshared bathroom. In 34.6% of the conjunctival samples, adenovirus serotype 8 was detected with identical genomic sequence. Establishment of hygienic sanitary guidance adapted for thecleaning of such establishments an d contact with residents as well as early diagnosis and good coordination of human and ma- terial resources are key factors in the prevention and control ofthese outbreaks in closed communities. Euro Surveill 2004;9(3):27-30 Published online Mar 2004 Key words : Keratoconjunctivitis, elderly, healthcare workers Introduction The clinical manifestations of epide mic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) were recognised for the first time in 1889 by Austrian investigators (1,2). Adenoviruses are a well recognised cause of punctate keratitis and follicular conjunctivitis which can be seen by examination of eye using a slit lamp (ophthalmic anterior segment microscope or biomicroscope) (3).The more frequently implicated adenoviral serotypes in EKC, corre-sponding to subgroup D, are 8, 19 and 37 (4). The incubation periodis between one and 30 days. The infectious period ranges from 3 daysbefore, to 14 days after onset of symptoms. The described inefficiencyof ammoniacal compounds in inactivating adenoviruses, and theirgood viability on environmental surfaces, improve the epidemic po-tential of these viruses (5).ORIGINAL ARTICLES Outbreak report EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 1-3 / w w .MM. los Frailes\".

Differences with regard to age and sex in residents and work-ers between cases and non-cases were explored. The _2 test or the ex-act Fisher test for the comparison of categorical variables and the t-testfor quantitative variables were used. The association in residents between illness and autonomy, incon- tinence, food, toilet, bathroom and dress dependence, cognitive dete-rioration, and availability of private bathroom were explored in contingency tables and using forward stepwise method in logistic re- gression model with probability criteria for entry of 0.05 and for re- moval of 0.10, and classification cutoff of 0.5. The OR (odds ratio) andits 95% confidence interval was obtained to estimate its association andconfusion for age and sex were controlled in the logistic regression. Laboratory investigation : Conjunctival fluid samples taken from 26 symptomatic patients were analysed for bacterial and viral isolation in a laboratory using the usual tests. Genome amplification techniques based on polymerasechain reaction (PCR) provide a rapid and sensitive alternative for adenovirus detection in clinical samples. Clinical samples were am-plified with specific nested PCR designed on the hexon protein gene(12). After amplification, direct sequencing of purified products in bothdirections was made using 2ml of DNA dilution in a mixture con-taining 4ml of Kit; Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems) of each sense or anti-sense inner primers to a final vol-ume of 10 ml. Phylogenetic analysis was performed on a fragment ofhexon protein coding region of the adenovirus genome. The analysisof sequences was made by pairwise alignment of the query sequencewith every adenovirus sequence deposited in the database (GenBank). Results Between 12 December 2001 and 10 March 2002, a total of 102 cases associated with this outbreak could be identified: 80 residents, 1 per-son attending the daycare centre, 18 workers and 3 family members. The global attack rate was 27.2%: 36.4% in residents and 12.9% in workers (p<0.001). In this last group attack rate was 15.8% in care staff and 6.7% in non-care staff (p=0.178). No significant differences couldbe observed between cases and non-cases with regard to age and sexin residents and workers (T ABLE 1). Attack rates by floor, module and the distribution of bathrooms for room in residents did not presentsignificant differences (T ABLE 2). The temporary distribution of the outbreak reflected in the epidemic curve (F IGURE ) completes the characteristics of a interpersonal trans- mission pattern, with several picks of incidence and with intervalswithout new cases. Nearly 70% of the cases were identified within a period of 30 days: from December 27 through January 25. An im-portant decrease could be observed later on. The multivariate logistic regression model showed that the three factors that appeared as independent risk factors were urinary in-continence (OR= 3.5), autonomy (OR= 9.7) and use of shared bath- room (OR= 6.1) (T ABLE 3). In a total of 9 clinical samples from 26 different patients (34.6%) isolation of adenovirus was possible in Hep-2 cell cultures. DNA fromclinical samples were extracted and amplified. Nucleotide sequencesfrom amplified products were studied using the corresponding se-quences available in the GenBank data sequence. All 9 samples presented100% homology with adenovirus type 8. Analysing a nucleotide sequences from each serotype, an individ- ual cluster was very strongly supported with bootstrap values of 100%. Discussion Adenovirus type 8 was detected and identified in this outbreak as the etiological agent. This virus is considered the main agent pro-ducing EKC and has acquired particular relevance as a causal agent ofnosocomial infections. Its specific biolo gical characteristics and the drop of the prevalence of protective antibodies found in the general Outbreak report Dependence was scored according to ability to carry out everyday tasks such as to smarten oneself up, get dressed, feed oneself, wash anduse the toilet without help and presence of urinary incontinence.Information on the presence or absence of cognitive deterioration was collected from medical records. Cases were all those who met the definition of case, and non-cases were all residents who did not. An epidemic curve was drawn.

This virus is also characterised to producemainly ocular disease in adults, although it has also been identified es-pecially as pathogen of the upper respiratory tract in children (14). Although an exhaustive investigation was carried out on the first cases, it was not possible to identify the initial source of infection ofthis outbreak. The first case identified consulted the ophthalmologistseveral days after the onset of EKC symptoms with an antecedent ofeye irritation due to spilling of eau de cologne. Perhaps in this case the real date of symptom onset of EKC was mistaken and occurred sev- eral days later. This patient's infection would be associated to themedical examination at the ophthalmologist. Nevertheless, the pos-sible existence of EKC cases in patients attending the ophthalmologyservices in this area of Madrid during these dates was also investigated,and no identification of any similar cases was detected, even althoughophthalmological clinics, contamination of devices, solutions and thehands of personnel have all been frequently implied in community EKCoutbreaks (6-8, 11, 13, 15-18) . Of the factors that could be investigated in connection with the pres- ence of EKC in the resident population, the most strongly identifiedwas the autonomy to wander through the building. Residents with thisfactor were over nine times more likely to develop the infection, com-pared with residents without autonomy. The autonomy to wanderthrough the building increased the probability of contact, either withother residents who had developed the disease or were still asympto-matic and/or with different surfaces and objects. This factor may playa relevant role in the dissemination of this outbreak. Residents whoshared a bathroom were six times more likely to develop the diseasethan those with private bathrooms,. Using the same bathroom wouldincrease the likelihood of sharing towels and other objects. Several au-thors have checked the inefficiency of some disinfectants against theadenovirus spread (15,16,19). A confirmed characteristic of aden-ovirus is its high capacity to conserve the infective potential and to re- sist and persist over long periods of time (over 28 days) on surfacessuch as plastic and metal in unfavorable conditions (20). As described in the literature (6,8, 13, 15) , a possible explanatory factor in the maintenance of viral transmission was the presence of anlarge number of workers affected throughout the epidemic period(especially personnel who were in direct contact with the residents). This is an important factor to take into account in order to prevent andinterrupt the transmission chain, because these persons could be apossible viral reservoir and a constant source of exposure for resi-dents. In our study, the attack rate inside the group of personnel withfunctions related to direct care (care staff) was 2.4 times great than thatof the group composed of workers without direct contact with the illresidents, although this difference was not statistically significant. Another fact that supports this influence was the association between the illness and urinary incontinence. The risk of EKC in these patientswas over 3 times greater than in other patients. In relation to this lastfactor, it may be worth noting that the care of those patients is closerand more intensive, due to more frequent physical contact and longerdaily attention from personnel, which represents an increment of therisk for spreading the infection. Another possible aspect to consider was is the difficulty of establishing an exhaustive control on rigorous com-pliance with the established prevention and control regulations, giventhe high number of workers of the facility. Both a high number of cases and a long period before the out- break is resolved have been characteristic in other EKC outbreaks de-scribed in the literature reflecting the difficulty of controllingnosocomial transmission despite the establishment of rigorous pre-vention measures (21). These difficulties have led to the development of infection control policies and procedures (ICPPs) in some oph-thalmological institutions (22), which have been demonstrated to beeffect in reducing the number of outbreaks and cases. The controlmeasures implemented in this outbreak were based on methods of per-sonal hygiene health education targeting residents and workers, es-pecially regarding the isolation of patients, handwashing, cleaningand disinfection of surfaces and instruments, use of treatments andadministrative norms that favours the resolution of the outbreak(withdrawing affected workers, restricting access to common areas).An important aspect to highlight in the control of this outbreak was the observed effect when diluted bleach solutions replaced amonia-cal compounds during the usual disinfection of surfaces. This changewas effective on 29 January, and 79% of the cases had onset of symp-toms before this date (F IGURE ). The adoption of an appropriate case definition was difficult in this investigation, because of the pr actical impossibility of taking sam- ples from all the patients who developed symptoms during the out-break. Therefore, case identification was essentially based on clinicaland epidemiological approaches. Furthermore, in elderly patients, whohave a high prevalence of eye disease, the assessment of certain signsand symptoms can be very unspecific. Other aspects in connection with our case definition is that it permitted the study of false positives.One example is the study of a patient who was an institutional workerand presented with clinical symptoms compatible with conjunctivi-tis a month after the end of the outbreak. When the clinical samplesfrom this patient were studied, a different serotype of adenovirus wasidentified (data not shown). It was concluded that this patient was notpart of the outbreak of adenovirus type 8. The specific diagnosismethods for the detection and identification of viruses can solve notonly the aetiology of an outbreak but also the definition of sporadiccases associated with it. References 1.

In previous years, theproblem was addressed through an increasing number of iso- lated measure s, but in this strategy the Commission outlined a comprehensive European Community approach across all sec-tors. The strategy consists of fifteen actions in four key areas: surveillance, prevention, research and product development, and international cooperation. An important part of this strat- egy is the 'Council Recommendation on the prudent use of an-timicrobial agents in human medicine'. The Recommendation provides a detailed set of public health actions to contain an- timicrobial resistance. This paper presents the eleven points of action of the strategythat are directly related to human medicine, and discusses re- lated European Community activities. Under the new public health programme as well as under the research programme ofthe European Union, antimicrobial resistance is a key priority. Euro Surveill 2004;9(1):30-4 Published online Jan 2004 Key words : Antimicrobial resistance, Europe, European Community 1. European Commission, DG Health and Consumer Protection, Luxembourg 2. European Commission, DG Research, Brussels, Belgium Introduction Over the past years the problem of antimicrobial resistance has re- ceived increasing attention. At the level of the European Community (hereinafter referred to as Community), a key element was the advicein 1999 of a committee of independent scientists of the EuropeanCommission (hereinafter referred to as Commission) recommend- ing that the overall use of antimicrobials should be reduced in a bal-anced way in human medicine, veterinary medicine, animalproduction and plant protection (1). Following this recommendation,a number of initiatives were taken. The European Union has, for ex-ample, recently adopted a Directive to phase out the use of antibioticsas growth promoters in farm animals (2). In the fields of plant pro-tection and veterinary medicine, several measures are also now in place and more legislative acts are being prepared. In 1999, the Council of the European Union (hereinafter referred to as Council), drawing on recommendations of a European micro- bial threat conference (3), adopted a Resolution: 'A strategy againstthe microbial threat' (4). This resolution concludes that the problemcannot be contained by national initiatives alone, but requires a com-mon strategy at Community level. As a follow up in June 2001, the Commission proposed a 'Community Strategy against Antimicrobial Resistance' (5) (here- inafter referred to as Community strategy), including a proposal fora Council Recommendation on the prudent use of antimicrobialagents in human medicine (hereinafter referred to as CouncilRecommendation), that was adopted a few months later by the Council (6,7). The Council recommends that Member States im- plement national strategies to contain antimicrobial resistance andcharges the Commission with a number of tasks to support Member States particularly through the Community Network on the epi-demiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases (8).>>> 4.

The large European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS) is a network of national surveillance systems that currently comprises about 700 lab-oratories from 28 countries (10). The main function of EARSS is to mon-itor variations in resistance of indicator pathogens of major publichealth relevance and assist with targeting interventions and assessing ef-fectiveness of national intervention programmes. Several other sur-veillance systems also monitor susceptibility of pathogens. For instance, the 'Enter-net' network performs surv eillance of Salmonella and vero- toxin-producing E. coli (VTEC) infections, including the susceptibility to antimicrobials, whilst 'EuroTB' performs surveillance of tuberculo-sis including (multi) drug resistant TB. Susceptibility of meningococci,gonococci and syphilis is also being monitored. Action 2 calls for improvement in the collection of data on con- sumption of antimicrobial agents in all sectors. Such data exist inmany Member States but they are scattered, heterogeneous, and inmany instances not easily accessible. The Council Recommendationasks that Member States co-operate with the European Commissionto develop indicators to monitor prescribing practices. The Commission is funding, through the PHP , the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption in humans (ESAC) proj- ect that started in November 2001 with first results of the retrospec-tive data collection presented at the 13 thECCMID conference in Glasgow (11). Through this network, some 30 countries deliver com-prehensive national data on cost and volume of antimicrobial con-sumption in ambulatory and hospital care. Prospective andstandardised data collection started in 2003 and indicators to evalu-ate the appropriateness of antimicrobial use are being developed. Also starting in 2003, the Antimicrobial Resistance in the Mediterranean (ARMed) project, supported by FP5, aims to extend the implementation of the defined methodologies of EARSS andESAC into the Mediterranean region, involving Malta, Cyprus, Turkey,Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco and Jordan. To guide intervention, it is critical to understand the relation be- tween antimicrobial resistance and use. A recent study using EARSSdata showed that in the EU, antimicrobial resistance of S. pneumoniae to penicillin is correlated with use of beta-lactam antibiotics and macrolides at country level (12). T o further study and monitor the linkbetween antimicrobial resistance data and antimicrobial use, EARSSand ESAC are linking their respective datasets. TABLE 1 The four key areas and fifteen priority actions of the Community strategy against antimicrobial resistance Key areaAction Surveillance 1. Develop co-ordinated and coherent surveillance networks at the European level. Encourage the participation of non-EU countries and strengthen the links between already established surveillance networks in human and veterinary medicine 2. Put in place and improve the collection of data on consumption of antimicrobial agents in all sectors Prevention 3. Increase the importance of antimicrobial resistance information for the market authorisation process in human and veterinary medicine an d agriculture 4. At Community level, support educational campaigns directed at professionals (clinicians, veterinarians, farmers) and the genera l public to avoi d overuse and misuse of antimicrobial agents 5. Ensure that the principle that antibacterial substances are available in human and veterinary medicine by prescription only is fully applied and that these are distributed in a controlled way in agriculture. Evaluate whether the prescription-only rule sho uld be applied to all antimicrobial agents as a precaution 6. Reinforce and promote prevention programmes of infections in human and veterinary medicine, in particular immunisation 7. Reinforce the residue monitoring system in food as regards methods of analysis, sanctions and reporting system 8. Phase out and replace antimicrobial agents used as growth promoters in feed 9. Review the use of the two authorised antimicrobial agents in food 10. Ensure that GMOs* which contain genes expressing resistance to antibiotics in use for medical or veterinary treatment are taken into p articular consideration when carrying out an environmental risk assessment, with a view to identifying and phasing out antibiotic resistance mark ers in GMOs which may have adverse effects on human health and the environment Research and product development 11. Encourage the development of new antimicrobial agents 12. Encourage the development of alternative treatments and vaccines 13. Support the development of rapid and reliable diagnostic and susceptibility tests International co-operation 14. Strongly encourage the development of cooperation, coordination and partnership at international level in particular via the existing international organisations 15. Pay special attention to candidate and developing countries by helping them putting in place the appropriate structures * GMO: Genetically Modified Organisms32 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 1-3 Euroroundup Prevention Action 3 of the Community strategy aims to increase the impor- tance of antimicrobial resistance information for the market autho-risation process. Regulators have expressed concerns that different indications, doses, dose regimens (dur ation of treatment) and dif- ferent pharmacodynamic information exist for similar products alreadylicensed in the EU. National competent authorities in consultation withthe European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal products (EMEA)are currently considering the issue of divergent product informationand Member States are requested, again by the CouncilRecommendation, to initiate activities to evaluate and update and harmonise the summary of product characteristics (SPC) where nec-essary. The EMEA has published a discussion paper on antimicrobialresistance outlining its activities and points out the need to find ways to promote new effective antibiotics (13). Criteria for market autho- risation of new antibacterial medicinal products are outlined in three EU guideline documents (14, 15, 16). Action 4 sets out to support educational campaigns to avoid over- use and misuse of antimicrobial agents. The Council Recommendation encourages Member States to pro- mote education and training of health professionals on the problemof antimicrobial resistance. They should also promote training onhygiene and infection control standards and immunisation pro- grammes in order to reduce the spread of microorganisms. The gen- eral public should be informed on the importance of prudentantimicrobial use through raised awareness of the problem of resist-ance, proper prescription, good patient adherence, the value of hygiene,and the impact of vaccination. The Commission is taking this forward in part by funding (under the PHP) a television documentary on the battle against resistant bac-teria to be used as an educational tool to promote appropriate antimi- crobial use. Also, the FP5 supported European Resistance InterventionStudy (EURIS), is evaluating different approaches to reduce the preva-lence of resistant pneumococci among children in European day carecentres. These approaches include education of doctors, day care staff, parents and children, optimised dosing, improved hygiene, notifica-tion of resistant strains and isolation of carriers. Finally, the Antibiotic Resistance Prevention And Control (ARPAC) project, aims at identifying hospital policies and prescription pat-terns associated with lower resistance rates to evaluate and harmonise strategies for prevention and control. Action 5 reinforces the principle that antibacterial substances should be available in human and veterinary medicine by prescriptiononly. Antimicrobial agents for systemic use in human medicine are bylaw prescription-only medicines in all Member States, but enforcementof this regulation varies. The PHP funded project 'Self-medication withAntibiotics and Resistance levels in Europe' (SAR) aims to quantify the consumption of antibiotics sold over the counter (without prescrip- tion) and of leftover (prescribed) antibiotics hoarded at home. Action 6 concerns prevention of infections, and in particular im- munisation. The pneumococcal disease in Europe (PNC-Euro) proj- ect, funded by FP5, focuses on the epidemiology of S. pneumoniae ina variety of European countries prior to the introduction of new con-jugate vaccines and aims to design cost effective prevention strategiesagainst pneumococcal infection. Containment of antimicrobial resistance is intrinsically linked to infection control practices. Hospitals in Europe Link for InfectionControl and Surveillance (HELICS) is a Commission funded project (PHP) to monitor hospital acquired infections, to develop protocolsfor databases on surgical and intensive care unit infections, and to setup evidence based infection control standards and recommendations. The Council Recommendation appealed to the Member States to exercise good practice in marketing antimicrobial agents. Member States should implement preventive measures, ensuring proper im-plementation of hygiene and infection control standards and en-courage national immunisation programmes. Actions 7 to 10 refer to preventive action in the fields of animal growth promoters, food, and environment and, although indirectly very relevant to public health, do not fall within the scope of this paper. Research and product developmentActions related to antimicrobial resistance were initiated already un- der the Fourth Framework Programme for Research and T echnologicalDevelopment (1994 to1998), but efforts have been greatly reinforcedduring FP5. Currently about 80 projects related to antimicrobial re-sistance are funded at a total contribution of over \u20ac100 million. This project portfolio addresses anti-b acterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral and TABLE 2 Projects funded under the public health programme related to antimicrobial resistance Acronym Full title Focus Co-ordinated by Web site EARSSEuropean Antimicrobial Resist ance Surveillance SystemAntimicrobial resistance of invasive isolates of S. pneumoniae, S. aureus , E.

About one third of the antimicrobialresistance project portfolio of FP5 is devoted to the discovery of new anti-infectives, either through identification of novel molecular tar-gets for the development of new classes of antimicrobials or throughexploitation of antibiotic producing organisms. Action 12 of the Community strategy encourages the develop- ment of alternative treatments and vaccines. Current FP5 researchincludes the development of resistance inhibitors, such as inhibitorsof bacterial conjugation and bacterial adhesion. Lactic acid bacteria,already widely used as probiotics for human consumption, are nowsubject to a rigorous biosafety evaluation study. Vaccine developmentis a major priority in FP5 and several research projects are currentlyon going with special emphasis on tuberculosis, malaria, HIV/AIDS,and hepatitis C virus. Also influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, shigel-losis and Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B are being addressed and efforts devoted to the development of novel vaccine delivery systemsand formula. In addition, a unique effort has been launched in Europeto provide an infrastructure for clinical trials of vaccines. This European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) hasbeen set up by a joint collaborative initiative among Member Statesand developing countries with the Commission as supporting part-ner. The main goal is to support phase II and III clinical trials ofpromising new clinical interventions against HIV/AIDS, malaria andtuberculosis in, with and for developing countries. Action 13 supports the development of rapid and reliable diagnostic and susceptibility tests. Currently funded FP5 projects include thedevelopment of sensors for multi-drug resistant strains of tuberculosis,a DNA chip based diagnostic test for P.aeruginosa ,nucleic acid based amplification methods for the detection of respiratory pathogens incommunity acquired pneumonia and a network for automated bac- terial strain fingerprinting. International cooperationAction 14 encourages the development of partnership at inter- national level, in particular via existing international organisations.The Commission and the World Health Organisation (WHO) havesigned a Memorandum of Understanding reconfirming their com-mon interest in health. Antimicrobial resistance is among the agreedpriorities and close cooperation with WHO has been ensured for all antimicrobial resistance related networks. The Commission is de-veloping a programme with WHO on strengthening pharmaceuti- cal policies, including the rational use of drugs and particularlysupporting national programmes to contain antimicrobial resist-ance through the expansion of projects that link surveillance data torational prescribing programmes. Action 15 attributes special attention to applicant and developing countries. The participation of non-EU Member States is foreseen and most candidate countries already participate in antimicrobial re-sistance surveillance networks. The FP5 research portfolio on an-timicrobial resistance includes seve n projects that are specifically focused on international issues, covering broad geographical areas. DiscussionAs has been presented here for human medicine, there is a wide range of activities being undertaken at Community level and in Member States. Community funded projects were initiated and through a legal provision (7), recommendations for action were made. Whilstin other areas some Community acts already existed (17, 18), forpublic health it was necessary to add a separate legal provision in theform of a Council Recommendation.Effective implementation requires several key features, including a clear action plan, delegation of authority and power to act, resourcesand sound mechanisms to assess the effectiveness of interventionsand thus allow feedback of results to influence future strategies. Oneof the key conclusions of the Council Recommendation is that MemberStates should put in place an 'intersectoral mechanism' for imple-menting relevant measures and for effective coordination with otherMember States and the Commission. No specific recommendations are made as to the nature of this mechanism, but one might assumethat in this body local, regional and national health authorities, the leg-islator, professionals of the different disciplines concerned and con-sumers would be represented. This national mechanism shouldcoordinate reporting structures at local and hospital level, prioritise the action needed, and charge the health authorities responsible withtaking action. The Commission has created a working group of rep-resentatives of the different national intersectoral mechanisms to as- sist in evaluating the implementation of the Council Recommendation.Member States are to report to the Commission on the implementa- tion of the Council Recommendation within two years of its adoption.The Commission intends to follow up on these reports to assesswhether the outlined Community strategy is successful or may need re-adjustments. Disease surveillance networks currently face problems with com- paring susceptibility data because of differences in methodology andinterpretation. The Council recommends that the Member Statesbuild upon existing national and int ernational systems for collecting data and using, wherever possible, internationally recognised classi-fication systems and comparable methods. It also asks the Commissionto propose where appropriate, common methodology, case defini- tions, and type of data to be collected and consequently to support ini-tiatives to standardise susceptibility testing in Europe so thatcomparable results and interpretations are produced. In 2002, a new programme of Community action in the field of pub- lic health (2003-2008) was adopted (19). This programme providesan annual public health work plan and a funding mechanism forprojects addressing priorities such as antimicrobial resistance. Over recent years emphasis has been given to surveillance initia- tives, whereas the focus of future public health work plans may needto be broadened. Activities that develop principles and guidelines for good practice on the prudent use of antimicrobial agents are neededas well as educational activities and intervention programmes to com-bat antimicrobial resistance. The Sixth Framework Programme (FP6) for Research and Technological Development (2002-2006) is supported by a set of new instruments designed to ensure more effective research in Europe(20). These instruments are 'Networks of Excellence' which aim tostructure, integrate and coordinate research resources and activitiesaround a given topic and 'Integrated Projects', which bring togetherexpertise to address ambitious research objectives. Research on an- timicrobial resistance is one of the priority areas also in FP6. The newinstruments are a tool to channel microbial and human genomic re-search towards applications such as new molecular drug targets, al-ternative therapeutic and preventive strategies, new diagnostic and susceptibility tests, epidemiological approaches and improved knowl-edge of molecular mechanisms behind resistance. Furthermore, meas-ures to provide scientific support to antimicrobial resistance in thecontext of public health (like intervention strategies and tools for be- havioural changes) are high on the FP6 agenda under policy orientedresearch (21, 22). In conclusion, in past years the problem of antimicrobial resistance was addressed through an increasing number of individual meas-ures. Through the Community strategy, the Commission has out-lined a more comprehensive and pro-active approach to containantimicrobial resistance, working closely in partnership at internationallevel, in particular with the WHO. In addition to legislative measuresthe Commission considers antimicrobial resistance as a key priorityfor its public health and research programmes. >>>METHODS FOR SENTINEL V IROLOGI CAL SURVEILLANCE OF INFLUENZA IN EUROPE - AN18- COUNTRY SURVEY TJ Meerhoff, A.

In addition, there is the ever-present threat of an influenza pandemic (3). In Europe, national influenza surveillance networks have been es-tablished since the 1950s. In the late 1980s, efforts were made to im-prove surveillance by integrating data on a European level through anumber of collaborative projects that led to the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS). The basis of the scheme is combined clinical and virological surveillanc e of influenza in the general pop- ulation. Sentinel physicians report cases of influenza-like illness (ILI)or acute respiratory infection (ARI) to a national data collection cen-tre and obtain respiratory specimens from patients for laboratory testing (4,5). With regard to the surveillance of infectious diseases such as in- fluenza, the role of the European Union (EU) has become more im-portant in recent years (6). The surveillance of influenza is a keyelement of the European influenza pandemic preparedness plan. Animportant task of surveillance is the early detection of influenza andthe characterisation of potential pandemic strains from clinical spec-imens (7). T o improve influenza surveillance in Europe, the EU hassupported the creation of a Community Network of ReferenceLaboratories for Human Influenza (7) to accomplish several tasks,including the co-ordination of methods employed by the MemberStates for the diagnosis of influenza. The European Scientific Working group on Influenza conducted an inventory in 1996 on the laboratory diagnostic and surveillancemethods in 24 European countries (8). This study showed that the tech-niques used in influenza surveillance were heterogeneous and theperformance of virological surveillance was therefore difficult to com-pare between countries. The methods used for the virological sur-veillance of influenza may have changed since 1996 and EISS wanted to have an update of the methods currently used for the testing of sen- tinel respiratory specimens in Europe. In addition, EISS wanted toknow whether tests were routinely performed for the detection ofother respiratory pathogens besides influenza. The inventory aimed EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 1-3 / w w w .eurosurveillance.org 35TABLE 1 Sentinel specimen collection and transport* NETWORKMaterial collected by sentinel physiciansTransport medium Mode of TransportTemperature at transport1Delay of transport (hrs) BelgiumTwo nasal an d one throat swabEMEM containing antibiotics + fungizoneMail Ambient 24-48 Czech RepublicNasopharyngeal swabs,blood 2 Special viral transport medium (NIC) Ambulance 4\u00b0C 24 DenmarkNasal swabs and aspi-ratesViral transport medium Mail Ambient 24-72 England Nasal and throat swabs NK Mail, courier or throat andthroat 48 Throat swabs Virocult (MedicalWire, England) Mail, courier Ambient 24-1203 Netherlands Nasal and throat swab GLY-medium + containing bovine albumin, fungizoneMail Ambient 24(-48) Poland Nasal and throat swabs Sterile PBS and antibiotics 8\u00b0C 24-48 Portugal Nasal swabs phosphate broth with gelatineMail, courier 4\u00b0C swabs,(blood) solution or virus culture medium with BSA, Courier 4\u00b0C60-72 Slovenia Nasal Courier4\u00b0C6 Mail throat swabs,(blood) Medium containing minimal = eagles minimum essential medium; GLY = glucose lactalbumin ye ast; PBS = phosphate buffered saline, NIC = National Influenza Centre. * Sweden was not included in the table as it did not collect sentinel specimens and the techniques used at the 24 laboratories performing influenza detection are too varied to be included in the table. 1 Ambient means no control of temperature / 2 Not regular / 3 Majority arrives in 48 hours / 4 Storage swab containments at am bient temperature, swabs kept at 4\u00b0C. 5 Majority arrives in 24 hours / 6 If possible / 7 When transported by mail / 8 In Ljubljana / 9 When transported by courierEuroroundup 36 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 1-3 to determine the status of virological methods routinely used by sen- tinel influenza surveillance networks participating in EISS during the 2001-2002 season. Material and MethodsA questionnaire on virological methods used for influenza diagnosis and surveillance was developed and sent electronically to all EISS col- laborating surveillance networks (T ABLE 1) in June 2002. People that were responsible for collecting virological data in each network were asked to complete the questionnaire. If a network had more than onereference laboratory, respondents were asked to complete a single questionnaire. Twenty-one networks participated in the study. The following topics were included in the questionnaire: speci- men collection, laboratory diagnosis of influenza and tests for otherrespiratory infections besides influenza. The questions in the survey concerned data collected during the 2001-2002 influenza season. All 21 networks completed the questionnaire.

Most networks (12/20) collect nasal as well as throat swabs. The remain-ing networks collect either nasopharyngeal, or nasal, or throat swabs.In addition, three networks collect blood samples and one network nasal aspirates. Transport of the swabs occurred by mail in 16 net-works and by courier in seven networks. Some networks used special delivery (Northern Ireland) or ambulance (the Czech Republic) forthe transport of the swabs. The temperature at transport was ambi-ent in 13 networks and 4\u00baC in five networks. The viral transportmedium meant to preserve virus viability used was diverse, but usu-ally contained antibiotics to inhibit growth of other microorgan-isms. Scotland used a lysis buffer specifically developed forpreservation of nucleic acid, and therefore only suitable for PCR.The time delay in transport of the material from the sentinel physi-cian to the laboratory varied between 0-120 hours for all networks;most networks reported a delay of 24-48 hours. Methods used for sentinel virological surveillance The methods routinely used by the EISS networks to isolate or identify the influenza viruses in sentinelrespiratory specimens arepresented in table 2. All but two networks (the Netherlands and Scotland) used cul- ture on MDCK cells for the detection of influenza viruses. Seven net-works used culture on embryonated chicken eggs, and five networks used other cell lines in addition to MDCK cells. Diverse rapid tech-niques for virus detection are used, with RT-PCR most often used inthe western countries and ELISA in the eastern countries. The delay between specimen collection and the test result for typ- ing (determination of influenza A or B) and subtyping (determina-tion of H subtype and occasionally the N subtype) is shown in table2. The delay was variable and differed between EISS networks. A com-parison of the delay in typing and subtyping is difficult to make sincea variety of methods were applied to determine the type and sub-type. For example, by using subtype specific PCR assays typing and subtyping can be done directly on the clinical specimen, whereaswhen typing and subtyping a virus isolate, the time needed to growthe virus is the defining factor. For typing of influenza viruses the following methods were ap- plied: PCR (11 networks), HAI (9 networks), IF (8 networks) andELISA (7 networks). For subtypingsub typing the HAI assay was usedin 15 networks. However, PCR was also used for subtyping in twelvenetworks. A total of nine networks applied more than one test to sub-type influenza viruses. None of the five networks in eastern Europe used PCR, while 12 out of 14 networks that perform subtyping inwestern Europe used PCR (T ABLE 2). Of these, eight networks used both HAI and PCR. Testing sentinel specimens for other respiratory infections Thirteen out of nineteen networks (the Czech Republic, England, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Portugal, Romania, Scotland, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Wales) reported that they collect information on respiratory pathogens other than in-fluenza virus in sentinel respirator y specimens. All thirteen networks collected information on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), six networks collected data on adenovirus, five networks collected data on parain- fluenzavirus and three networks collected data on rhinovirus. Threenetworks (England, the Netherlands and Slovenia) had informationon other respiratory pathogens (e.g. coronavirus, Chlamydia pneu-moniae, human metapneumovirus) (data not shown). Eleven net-works reported that the sentinel swabs were tested for both influenza virus and RSV .DiscussionThe results highlight similarities in the specimen collection and transport procedures in the EISS networks. In most networks nose swabs as well as throat swabs were obtained and transported by mailto the laboratory. The laboratory me thods used were heterogeneous, which confirms earlier findings (8). For virus culture, most networksused the same type of cells (MDCK), but for typing and subtyping ofinfluenza viruses different methods (ELISA, HAI, PCR) were used.ELISA was more often used for typing and subtyping in eastern Europeand PCR was more frequently used in western Europe. Another im-portant finding is that the majority of networks in EISS reported thatthey test sentinel swabs for other viruses (in particular RSV). The type of respiratory specimen, the delay in the transport of swabs, the transport medium and the transport temperature are im-portant factors that could potentially lead to an underestimation ofthe number of laboratory confirmed clinical cases of influenza re-ported by sentinel physicians. Our study has shown that most EISS net-works used nose and/or throat swabs. In general, these are considered to be the right specimens for techniques such as culture and im- munofluorescence (9). The transport of samples is advised at 4\u00baC or frozen at -70\u00baC (9). The outcome of our survey is that the specimenswere often sent by post, at an ambient temperature and usually took 24-48 hours to reach the laboratory. This can be considered subopti-mal, especially for virus culture. However, a study carried out inEngland and Wales found that clinical specimens sent by post providedgood results when using multiplex RT-PCR techniques, although it islikely that there is some degradation of viral nucleic acid when spec-imens are transported this way (10). Another factor, the viral trans-port medium, should ideally include a balanced salt solution at neutralpH with protein stabilizers such as gelatine or bovine serum albumin(BSA) and antibiotics (9). The EISS networks used diverse media forthe transportation of specimens, but in general these media met thementioned demands. All but one network used virus isolation on cell culture as the pri- mary method for the detection of influenza virus. This approach is com-monly used as the EISS laboratories characterise their virus isolatesand/or send material to the WHO Collaborating Centre at Mill Hill forstrain characterisation, an activity that is very important to map thespread of influenza globally and to establish the influenza vaccines inthe southern and northern hemispher es each season. The reasons for using additional techniques, like PCR and ELISA, for detection wereconfirmation of the results, increased sensitivity and the detection of other respiratory pathogens such as adenovirus (e.g. in Slovenia, Spainand Switzerland). The harmonisation of virological testing methods is an important objective of EISS. T o initiate these efforts, a first Quality ControlAssessment (QCA) was performed during the 2000-2001 season (11). Differences in virological results can be associated with the use of dif-ferent laboratory techniques (e.g. PCR vs. cell culture (10, 12,13)) ordifferences in the application of the same laboratory technique (e.g.PCR). The first QCA, carried out in 16 EISS laboratories, found thatthe sensitivity of the RT-PCR in Europe varied widely (40-100% for in-fluenza, 71-86% for RSV), depending on the laboratory (11). A secondQCA was carried out during the 2002-2003 season and considerableimprovements in the sensitivity rates were found (data not shown). Theresults of the first two QCAs, and QCAs planned in the future, will be used to further harmonise virological testing methods in EISS. The finding that sentinel specimens were being tested for other respiratory infections is important for EISS, as many agents are asso- ciated with clinical symptoms of influenza-like illness and acute res-piratory infection. An important pathogen that contributes to thisburden of disease is RSV; in terms of mortality the role of RSV is sug-gested to be even greater than influenza B and influenza A/H1N1 (2).Our inventory found a large proportion of the networks testing sen-tinel specimens for RSV and EISS could the refore collect more detailed information on RSV activity in Europe. These findings have led to theEuroroundup 38 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 1-3 creation of an RSV Task Group to explore how the surveillance of RSV could be better developed and further integrated into EISS. In conclusion, sample collection and shipment are more or less sim- ilar whereas detection and (sub)typing methods are heterogeneousamong the EISS networks. Despite this heterogeneity, results for de-tection and (sub)typing can be considerably improved when care- fully controlled by external quality control, as the results of the twoQCA studies showed. Further improvements may be made by a bet-ter harmonization and standardization of the applied methods. EISS will therefore take a number of actions within the framework of the recently created Community Network of Reference Laboratories for Human Influenza; these include the definition of basic tasks to be carried out by the laboratories, the preparation of standardised lab-oratory protocols and further QCAs.

Thirteen of them were HIV positive (and already aware of their HIV status), and eight had a concomitant other sexually trans- mitted infection. One of the LGV patients had very recently been di-agnosed as infected with hepatitis C (HCV), and sexual transmissionwas thought to be the only possible route of his infection. Contact trac-ing is underway to find other HCV cases and to establish whethersexual transmission of HCV can be proven. Three other suspected LGVcases are currently being investigated, having been identified by in-tensified contact tracing. All men reported unprotected insertive and receptive anal sexual contact. Fisting (insertive and receptive) was commonly reported. Many sexual contacts were anonymous, hampering individual contact tracing. Sexual contacts have been reported in Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom and France. This is an outbreak of LGV in MSM, a majority of whom are HIV infected, which may extend through a large part of western Europe.The ulcerous character of LGV favours transmission and acquisitionof HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases as well as other blood-borne diseases (5). Active case finding (for both LGV and HCV), registration and con- tact tracing have been intensified and warning of networks of MSM whohave sex with each other is ongoing. Medical professionals (STI clin-ics, general practitioners, HIV physicians and gastroenterologists) arecurrently being informed of the situation. It is recommended that pa-tients are treated with 100 mg doxycycline twice daily for 21 days (6).In view of the patients' international contacts, international warnings and alertness is needed. Concerted action of professionals in infec-tious disease control and curative care is called for. References 1.

The first case, in a white, HIV infected, bisexual man, was diagnosed at the STI clinic with an early LGV (serovar L2) infection in February2003, and a report of this case has recently been published (1). TwoHIV infected, homosexual men presented with proctitis at the out-patient clinic in Rotterdam in April 2003, although there was appar-ently no link to the first patient. Laboratory results showed that theywere also infected with Chlamydia trachomatis serovar L2. A cluster of LGV cases was found through contact tracing, and two other cases,not connected to this cluster, presented themselves. Most patientspresented with proctitis, and some with constipation. LGV is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by C. tra- chomatis serovars L1, L2 and L3. The incidence of LGV in the devel- oped world is low, and incidental cases are considered to be importsfrom areas where LGV is endemic, such as West and East Africa, India,Southeast Asia, South and Central America, and some Caribbean is-lands (2,3). LGV infections of the rectum result in much more severeinflammation than non-LGV infections. LGV infections often involvethe colon, and they generally produce symptomatic disease.(7) Proctoscopy was performed in all cases. Urine and rectal swabs, were used for PCR testing for C. trachomatis, using the automated C. tra- chomatis Cobas Amplicor PCR system (Roche Diagnostics, Almere, the Netherlands). Genotyping of the gene encoding the major outer mem- brane protein (MOMP) was performed by nested polymerase chainreaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) (4), using DNA isolated from positive clinical specimens. Serum spec-imens were collected and analysed for the presence of specific IgAand IgG antibodies to C. trachomatis by peptide enzyme immunoassay(SeroCT; Savyon Diagnostics Ltd., Ashdod, Israel). Cases were defined as homosexual men with a history of proctitis and/or contact with a known case of LGV , in categories according tolaboratory results (T ABLE ). Between April and December 2003, 10 confirmed, 2 probable, and 1 possible LGV2 cases were found, as well as one confirmed LGV1 case.Notably, all cases had anal swabs positive for chlamydia with PCR, whereas urethral swabs were negative for chlamydia.

Published online 22 January 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/040122.asp) The outbreak of tetanus in injecting drug users (IDUs) in England first reported in November 2003 (1) is ongoing, and has spread to Scotland and Wales. Since the last update (2), two more cases* havebeen reported, giving a total of 14 cases in the United Kingdom (UK)between July 2003 and 21 January 2004 ( FIGURE 1). The most recent onset date was 19 January 2004. The majority of cases had generalised tetanus and one case is known to have died. Nine cases were in females, and five in males. Sevenout of nine cases for whom information on the method of injectionwas available, reported subcutaneous injection of heroin ('skin pop-ping'). All cases with information on the type of drug injected (eightcases) reported heroin injection. Information on tetanus immunisa-tion status was available for eight cases. Of these, only one was reportedas having been immunised in the past 10 years, and three had prob-ably never been immunised. Four of the cases have been tested fortetanus IgG and all had levels below the minimum protective level, which supports the claim that they may not have had a full course oftetanus vaccination. Clostridium tetani was isolated from one case; in another case tetanus toxin was detected in a serum sample. The ageof cases ranged between 20 and 53 years, with female cases beingyounger than male cases (median age 27 and 46 years, respectively). Eleven cases were reported from England, of which eight were fromthe west of the country. Two cases have been reported from Scotland,and one from Wales ( FIGURE 2). In addition to these 14 cases, two potentially relevant reports were received of an IDU with trismus, and the isolation of C. tetani from an abscess of an IDU in England. These reports do not fit the case def-inition, but are likely to be associated with the same source as that whichis causing the cases in this outbreak. T o our knowledge, no cases oftetanus in IDUs have been reported from elsewhere in Europe. The current cluster of tetanus in IDUs can be explained by con- tamination with tetanus spores at any stage during the production, dis-tribution, storage, cutting, or injecting of heroin. The observation that no cases have been reported from elsewhere in Europe, however,is consistent with contamination occurring within the UK. The wide-spread distribution of cases within the UK suggests contamination rel-atively high in the supply chain. The peak in the number of cases inweek 45 (F IGURE 1) may indicate a point source rather than ongoing contamination. Descriptive information on the cases so far suggests that subcutaneous injection of heroin is a contributing factor, whichis consistent with previous reports on Clostridium infections in IDUs (4, 5). The predominance of women and older injectors among ourcases was also found in the cluster of severe illness and death amongIDUs which occurred in England in 2000, and could be explained bythese being more likely to have difficulties accessing veins and, there-fore, to inject subcutaneously or intramuscularly (4, 6). Waning or in-complete immunity is an additional factor. Continued vigilance for early signs and symptoms of tetanus in IDUs is important, since early treatment with intravenous tetanusimmunoglobulin, antibiotics, and wound debridement can be lifesaving. Information on diagnosis, treatment, and public health man-agement of tetanus for health professionals is available at(http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/tetanus/tetanus_health_professionals.pdf). Information for IDUs is available from (http://www.hpa.org.uk/in- fections/topics_az/tetanus/advice_to_idu_271103.pdf). Tetanus can present with local fixed muscle rigidity and painful spasms confined to the area close to the site of injury or injection. Although localised tetanus can lastweeks or months, it is more com- monly a precursor to generalisedtetanus. The illness can progress for about two weeks. Generalisedtetanus can present with symptoms ranging from mild trismus ('lock- jaw'), neck stiffness and/or ab-dominal rigidity to generalisedtetanus, which includes general spasticity, severe dysphagia, respi-ratory difficulties, severe and painful spasms, opisthotonus, andautonomic dysfunction.

Tetanus is a vaccine preventable disease. In the UK, five doses of tetanus toxoid containing vaccine at the appropriate intervals are considered sufficient for lifelong protection as long as tetanus prone wounds are treated with prophylactic tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) (3). The information obtained so far on vaccination status of thecases is consistent with this, in that none of the cases has reported tohave received all five doses. Health professionals in regular health care settings and drug serv- ices should ask IDUs about their tetanus immunisation status. IDUswho have not received five doses of tetanus-containing vaccine or areunsure about their vaccination status, should be offered additionaltetanus-low dose diphtheria (Td) vaccination. Many IDUs will re- quire at least one booster. Unvaccinated IDUs should be encouragedto complete a primary course of Td vaccination followed by two fur- ther boosters. Even individuals who have received five doses of tetanus vaccine in childhood may eventually have insufficient antibody levels to pro-tect against heroin or a wound heavily contaminated with C. tetani. Generally, those who are exposed to risk of tetanus through injury arerecommended to receive TIG even if fully vaccinated (3). This rec- ommendation is impracticable for IDUs who may be at recurrentrisk through regular injection. The question remains unanswered whether IDUs might benefit from regular boosters to ensure protec-tion from ongoing contamination of heroin and/or from exposure toother sources. The Health Protection Agency's Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre would welcome any reports of tetanus in IDUs in Europe.Please send reports to joanne.white@hpa.org.uk * Cases in this cluster are defined as a person with clinical evi- dence of tetanus infection** who has injected illicit drugs in themonth before onset of symptoms, and whose onset of symptoms wasafter the 1st July 2003. ** Clinical evidence of tetanus infection is defined as mild to mod- erate trismus and one or more spasms, autonomic dysfuntion.

Published online 15 January 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/040115.asp) Seventy one cases of legionnaires' disease have been reported to the local health authorities in Pas-de-Calais (northern France) since 28 November 2003 (1,2). A diagnosis of legionnaires' disease has been con- firmed for 70 cases (14 by culture, 55 cases by urinary antigen detec-tion, and one by seroconversion). One case is presumptively diagnosedby single high antibody titre. Results of serological analysis are awaited for three other cases already reported to the health authorities. Forty six cases (65%) are in men, and the mean age for all cases is 72 years. For all reported cases, the date of onset of clinical symptomsis between 9 November 2003 and 5 January 2004 (F IGURE ). T o date, 20 patients are still in hospital, and 9 patients have died. Isolates have been obtained from 14 of the clinical samples re- ceived by the Centre National de R\u00e9f\u00e9rence (CNR) des Legionella (na- tional reference centre for legionellae). Six of these strains are frompatients whose symptoms began after 14 December 2003. These 14 strains are identical (same genomic profile). Two isolates from patientsadmitted to hospital after 14 December are still being analysed. According to patient information collected by the health author- ities, most of the patients were resident in or often visited an area tothe east of the town of Lens (Harnes and neigbouring communes) dur-ing the 10 days preceding their illness. The environmental investigation is being lead by the local Direction R\u00e9gionale de l'Industrie, de la Recherche et de l'Environnement(DRIRE, regional administration for industry, research and the envi-ronment) and local health authorities, and control measures con- cerning sites posing a possible risk have been taken (disinfection of cooling systems). Analysis of environmental samples taken from the Noroxo indus- trial plant in Harnes has confirmed that this plant was a source of contamination. These environmental samples are identical to those from the 14 patients. The Noroxo plant was closed between 3 and 20December 2003 for disinfection. Samples taken from the cleaningramps at a carwash in Harnes indicated the presence of legionella .T h e identification of these legionellae by the CNR showed them to be thesame strain as that indentified in the 14 patients and at the Noroxo plant. Environmental samples taken from other sites in the investigation have been sent to the CNR for analysis, and systematic disinfection hasbeen carried out. Samples have been taken from 58 of the patients' EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 1-3 / w w w .eurosurveillance.org 411 91 01 11 21 31 41 51 61 71 81 92 02 12 22 32 42 52 62 7 2 82 93 0 9 12345678 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 1 8 1 9 2 0 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 1 2 3 4 5 6234567 November December JanuaryCases Date of symptom onsetFIGURE Distribution of cases of legionnaires' disease in the Pas-de- Calais, according to date of onset of symptoms in the 69 casesinterviewed; November 2003 - January 2004. Source: InVS.homes to be tested for legionella .Samples from only two homes have been positive, indicating that these do- mestic sources of contamination cannot be consideredto be the source of the outbreak. Given the epidemic curve, which has two successive waves of cases, and the data available at this stage, in-vestigations are continuing to explain the presentation of new cases since mid-December. Since no other source ofcontamination can be identified at this stage, the hy- pothesis remains that contamination persists at the sourcealready identified (Noroxo). The Noroxo plant was closedagain by the local prefecture on 2 January 2004. The discovery of the same epidemiological strain in a second place (the carwash) does not rule out the hy-pothesis that the Noroxo plant is the origin of the first waveof cases. However, it is very unlikely that the second sourceof contamination could cause such a large number ofcases, given their geographical distribution over a widearea, and the fact that few of the patients had visited this carwash.Whatever the cause, it is extremely unlikely that a source of this nature could be the origin of such a large outbreak over such a wide geo- graphical area. Following a prefectoral order, all carwashes within a ra- dius of 10 km around the Noroxo plant have been closed. Analysis of the environmental samples is still underway at the CNR. The comparison of the human and environmental strains couldshed light on the existence of one or more sources of contamination. Owing to the size and unusual nature of this outbreak, the minis- ters of health, and of ecology and sustainable development have sent national experts to assist the local prefect and local services. They ar-rived on site on 6 January. Heightened surveillance continues in order to identify and treat new cases as early as possible, so that more serious cases and deathscan be avoided.

Published online 2 January 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/040102.asp) During October 2003, a rise in admissions of bacterial tracheitis to the sole regional paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in Northern Ireland was noted, which coincided with increasing influenza-like ill- ness and influenza A activity among the paediatric population, andan epidemiological investigation was begun. For the purposes of the investigation, a confirmed case was defined as a child (aged <8 years) admitted to PICU since 1 September 2003with breathing difficulties and tracheal inflammation on bronchoscopy. Seventeen children met the case definition by 30 November. This in-cidence during the three month period was significantly in excess ofthat noted in the previous ten years from the hospital database (F IGURE ). Patients initially presented to different hospitals around the region with barking cough (100%), breathing difficulty (100%), inspiratory stridor (88%) and high fever (75%). They did not respond to the usualnebulised steroid treatment for viral croup infection and required in-tubation. Thick bronchial secretions were evident bronchoscopyshowed erythema (100%) and pus (88%) in the trachea. Of the 17 cases, ages ranged from 7 months to 8 years, but most of the children (69%) were under two years old. Eleven were boys andsix were girls. They lived in different parts of the region with no evi-dence of geographic clustering. Most (69%) had no significant med-ical history without underlying illnesses and did not belong to highrisk groups for influenza infection. Four of the children were reported to suffer from chronic diseases (one suffered from asthma, one from chronic otitis, one from recurrent urinary tract infections and one from febrile seizures). The median duration of illness before hospital at-tendance was 24 hours, ranging from 12 to 48 hours, indicating rapid progress of the disease. All patients fully recovered. Bacterial cultures from bronchial secretion specimens taken on admission from 15 of the 17 cases identified different bacteria (in-cluding (n=1)), while four were culture negative and two were not available(T ABLE ). Of the seven cases that were tested by PCR for viruses, two were negative, one was positive for influenza A (H3), one for rhi- novirus, one for picornavirus, and two for parainfluenza type 2.Parainfluenza type 2 had not been isolated in Northern Ireland for al- most ten years. Tracheitis is a rare bacterial infection of the trachea capable of producing airway obstruction and is potentially life threatening (1).It is most common in young children, possibly because a child's smaller trachea is easily obstructed by inflammation. The disease canbe caused by a variety of bacteria, with no single pathogen being pre-dominant. It is usually preceded by a recent viral respiratory infection 42 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 1-3 number JJASO D12345678 Mean number of cases 1993 to 2002 Number of cases 2003Control limits mean + 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations FIGURE Excess number of cases of bacterial tracheitis by month, Northern Ireland, 2003 (statistical process control chart for bacterial tracheitis). Source: CDSC.(2). Most patients present with acute onset of respiratory distress, fever, toxicity, and stridor after a prodrome of upper respiratory tractinfection lasting a few days (3). This condition may rapidly progressand the standard croup treatment is ineffective. Tracheitis requires hos-pitalization and, almost always, endotracheal intubation. The diagnosisis based on endoscopic findings of tracheal inflammation and shouldbe suspected if a child with croup-like symptoms does not respond toconventional therapy. The observed increase in bacterial tracheitis may reflect recent in- creased influenza and viral activity observed this season. Increasedawareness of bacterial tracheitis in children is therefore important. Advice and information on this potentially lethal disease is being cas- caded to paediatricians and hospitals around the region. Active sur-veillance of new cases is being developed to monitor the trend over the remaining winter months and assess if further actions are required. References : 1. Cherry E, editors.

SHORT REPORTS SURVEILLANCE OF CRYPTOSPORIDIOSIS IN SPAIN FROM 1995 TO2003 P Soler Crespo on behalf of Red Nacional de Vigilancia Epidemiol\u00f3gica (Spanish National Network of EpidemiologicalSurveillance), Centro Nacional de Epidemiolog\u00eda, Madrid, Spain. Translated and adapted from reference 1 Published online 4 March 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/040304.asp) There are two sources of information for the surveillance of Cryptosporidium in Spain: the Outbreak System (Sistema de Brotes)and the Microbiological Information System (Sistema de Informaci\u00f3n Microbiol\u00f3gica, MIS). The former analyses the results of the investigations of outbreaks and clusters, including those which oc- cur among international tourists. Notification of outbreaks is manda-tory and standardised; a uniform outbreak reporting electronic format (variables and codification) has been developed according to WorldHealth Organization recommendations. All outbreaks must be im- mediately reported to regional health authorities, which carry out in-vestigations and implement necessary control measures. Some regions have set up early warning systems in order to assist physicians with re-porting and investigating outbreaks. At national level, only outbreaksconsidered of national significance need to be reported immediately. A national early warning system is currently under development. The MIS is based on the voluntary weekly reports of microbiological diagnoses of individual cases carried out by laboratories (mainly hos-pital). Data obtained from these individual case reports includes theagent, date of diagnosis, place, age, sex, etc. This system covers ap-proximately 25% of the Spanish population, since only five of 19Spanish regions currently report cases to this system. A total of 823 cases of cryptosporidiosis were reported in this way from 1995 to 2002 (annual average of 103 cases). No increase in thenumber of cases reported was detected during this period. Patients aged 1-4 years represented 28% of reported cases, those aged 30-39 repre-sented 10%. The distribution of the age groups of the cryptosporidiosis cases shows that incidences of this illness decreased in adults while amongstcases younger than 15 years old it remained constant for the entire studyperiod (F IGURE ). One per cent of patients under 15 years old were immunocompromised. In the 20 to 49 group, 67% were immuno-compromised during in the period 1995 to 1999, decreasing to 30% between 1999 and 2002.

Spain 1995-2002.44 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 1-3 Through the Outbreak System, eleven outbreaks of cryp- tosporidiosis (1455 cases, average of 132 cases per outbreak) were re- ported from 1995 to 2003 (the 823 cases reported through the MIS were sporadic cases not linked to outbreaks, and are not included in this fig-ure). The number of outbreaks reported did not increase over this pe-riod (T ABLE ) In many waterborne outbreaks of gastroenteritis, the agent is unknown (27% of all such outbreaks reported in Spain in 2000)and some of them may be caused by Cryptosporidium. The settings reported included schools, hotels, the community and a picnic. The vehicle of transmission was not always reported.Where it was reported, it was always water. The source of infection was reported for six outbreaks, and was the water supply in three out- breaks, the swimming pool in two and a well in one. The four outbreaks that occurred in hotels and affected foreign tourists were reported through European surveillance networks or directly by the epidemiological services of different countries (2).This type of outbreak is usually recognised when the tourists returnhome. The epidemiological information collected is limited to thename of the hotel where they stayed, the start and end dates of the hol-iday, and the date of symptom onset. CommentaryIt is important that cryptosporidium cases are diagnosed and re- ported through surveillance so that outbreaks can be detected and pre-vented. The MIS detects Cryptosporidium infections, although this system is not completely developed. At present, only five regions re-port cases to this system. In order to improve notification, this pro-cedure is becoming compulsory for a designated group of representative laboratories across the whole of Spain. The results of the information provided by the Outbreak Systempoint to two main settings: schools and hotels. In the schools, thewater supply predominated as the vehicle of transmission and in thehotels, it was the swimming pool. Coordination with environmentalhealth authorities needs to be strengthened to improve the surveillanceof this pathogen in water supply systems and swimming pools. Only two of 11 outbreaks were community outbreaks. The reason for this could be a lack of systematic microbiological diagnosis of thehuman and environmental samples in the waterborne outbreaks. Since Cryptosporidium is a microorganism resistant to water chlori- nation, it could be a cause of waterborne gastroenteritis outbreaks whenthe water is apparently fit to drink. Research is needed into outbreaksof unknown causes compatible with Cryptosporidium. The majority of the outbreaks that affected foreign tourists were reported by the same country, the United Kingdom (UK), and occurred in the same region of Spain, the Balearic Islands. This is due to an ac-tive system for the detection of infectious diseases in tourists in theUK and the large number of tourists from the UK and other westernEuropean countries who holiday here. The poor epidemiological in- formation received from the country of origin makes the epidemio-logical investigation of most outbreaks very difficult. However, theimplementation of systems of surveillance that permit the identificationof gastroenteritis outbreaks in tourists is very useful. References: 1.

H. pylori associated dis- eases like peptic ulcers or MALT-lymphoma can be healed by anantimicrobial eradication therapy as recommended by the MaastrichtConsensus 2000 (1). However, increasing resistance to commonly used antibiotics like clarithromycin or metronidazole are compro-mising the eradication of H. pylori and causing therapy failures. Knowledge of the current resistance status of H. pylori therefore would be helpful for designing an optimally adapted therapy and preparingtherapeutic recommendations. The largest German study of H. pylori so far, investigated the re- sistance patterns of 554 clinical routine isolates (2). About 70% ofthe examined strains were resistant to metronidazole, and 50% toclarithromycin. The majority of the isolates exhibited resistancesagainst both antibiotics. One of the major tasks of the German National Reference Centre for Helicobacter pylori ,set up in 2000, was to perform a nationwide sen- tinel study called 'ResiNet' . The aim of the study is to establish a reli-able database from which information on the development and riskfactors of antimicrobial resistance in H. pylori in Germany can be obtained, and evidence based recommendations for H. pylori eradi- cation therapy drawn up.TABLE Outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis reported to the Red Nacional de Vigilancia Epidemiol\u00f3gica.

In addition, 5200 ques- tionnaires were sent to German gastroenterologists to evaluate theircurrent strategies of diagnostics and eradication regimes. In both in-vestigations, interest in cooperation with ResiNet was evaluated. Data analysis revealed that microbiological in vestigation of gastric biopsies does not play an important role in the primary diagnosis of H. pylori infection and therefore, as a rule, patients are treated following theMaastricht guidelines without prior susceptibility testing. Interestingly, a tendency was apparent to change therapy after detecting a possibleresistance. However (cases of treatment failure included), gastroen- terologists did not initiate susceptibility testing, mainly due to inac- cessibility of a competent microbiological laboratory that was familiar with the appropriate techniques. After these preceding investigations, ResiNet started in June 2001 as a pilot project with two cooperating laboratories, increasing to 16laboratories currently participating in the study. The prospective study design focussed on collect ing data as minimally biased and repre- sentative as possible. During the study weeks, two groups of gas-troenterological sentinel practices, each closely collaborating with their respective microbiological study centres, consecutively enrolledpatients who were admitted for gastroduodenoscopy, gave their in-formed consent, and whose gastric biopsy Helicobacter urease testresult was positive within the first 60 minutes. Each gastroenterolo- gist enrolled three to five patients over the age of 18 years every week for six weeks, equally distributed over a 12 month period. Patients wereunselected in respect of any treatment failure in the past, or any otherclinical or socioeconomic characteristics. Clinical and epidemiolog-ical data were prospectively collected. All microbiological study cen-tres applied standardised operating procedures provided by the National Reference Centre, and used identical lots of culture media dur- ing identical study weeks. One desirable secondary outcome of ResiNetis the achievement of nationwide standardised and quality controlledculture and resistance testing procedures for H. pylori . The data shown is from a total of 274 patients up to September 2003. Complete clinical and epidemiological data including preceding treat- ment regimes as well as resistance data of the respective isolates wereavailable for analysis. Resistance data obtained from H. pylori isolates from gastric biop- sies sent routinely for microbiological investigation differ significantlyfrom those systematically collected from study patients (F IGURE 1). Differences are obvious at the first glance for the frequencies of sin-gle resistances to metronidazole (32% vs. 15%) and especially being doubly resistant to metronidazole and clarithromycin(40% vs. 10%), clearly indicating that data fr om routine investigations are not representative and often heavily biased by selection of pa-tients investigated. Out of a total of 274 study patients, 196 had not been pre-treated for H. pylori infection, 24 reported one pre-treatment, and 22 had had repeated treatments previously. Pre-treatment data were missingfrom 32 patients. The still pr eliminary data clearly show that pre- treatment and especially repeated pre-treatment were associated with a remarkable increase of single resistances to clarithromycin and es-pecially with double resistances to metronidazole and clarithromycin.(Fig. 2)n = 600 n = 274 study isolates routin e isolatesPercentage of isolates resistant (%) Metronidazole (Mz) Clarithromycin (Cla) Mz and Cla Ciprofloxacin Rifampicin05101520253035404550FIGURE 1 Prev alence of H. pylori resistance according to source n = 196n = 24n = 22 repeatedly pre-treated pre-treated not pre-treatedPercentage isolates resistant (%) 010153040 60 Metronidazole (Mz) (Cla) Mz RifampicinFIGURE 2 Prev alence of H. pylori resistance according to frequency of pre-treatment n = 57 n = 141 n = 66 pts with normal mucosa pts with gastritis pts with ulcer diseasePercentage of isolates resistant (%) 05101525 Metronidazole Mz 3 Prev alence of H. pylori resistance according of underlying disease46 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 1-3 Endoscopical disease (25%), gastritis or other pathological changes (53%), normal gastric mucosa (22%). Interestingly enough, more sensitive strainswere isolated from patients with peptic ulcer disease, whereas indi- viduals with normal gastric mucosa harboured resistant strains most frequently. Patients with gastritis ranged between both groups.(F IGURE 3) In conclusion, these data provide evidence that systematic and prospective data are essential for representative resistance surveil-lance studies. Data from routinely investigated biopsies are clearlynot sufficient. Furthermore it is obvious that repeated empirical treat-ment regimes are especially associated with the post-treatment pres-ence of strains exhibiting double resistance to metronidazole andclarithromycin. Present data support the following recommendations if eradication treatment is indicated: * patients without previous antimicrobial therapy may be empirically treated * empiric treatment of all patients, regardless of their medical history is associated with an increase of double resistant isolates * it appears wise to undertake a microbiological investigation of gastric biopsies in all patients previously treated with antimicro- bials and to test the H. pylori isolates for resistance so that a specific and appropriate therapy may be adopted References: 1.

INCREASE IN REPORTED HIV MSM INOSLO, NORWAY H Blystad, \u00d6 Nilsen, P Aavitsland, department of infectious disease epidemiology at the Nasjonalt folkehelseinstitutt (Norwegian Institute of Public Health), Oslo, Norway Published online 11 March 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/040311.asp) An increase in the number of newly diagnosed HIV infections among men who have sex with men (MSM) in several western European countries has been reported previously (1,2). Figures released by the department of infectious disease epidemiology at the Nasjonalt folke-helseinstitutt (Norwegian Institute of Public Health, NIPH) in Oslo nowshow that the same trend can be observed in Norway (3). In 2003, a total of 238 cases of newly diagnosed HIV in- fections were reported to the Meldingssystem for smitt-somme sykdommer (Norwegian surveillance system forcommunicable diseases, MSIS); 145 males and 93 females. This is the highest ever reported annual number of newlydiagnosed HIV cases in Norway. Cases diagnosed in peo-ple who originated from countries outside Europe withgeneralised HIV epidemics and arrived as asylum seekersand refugees still dominate the Norwegian HIV statistics.In 2003, this group constituted 59% of reported HIV cases. Another reason for the high number of cases reported in 2003 is a near twofold increase of cases in MSM, from 30reported cases in 2002 to 57 cases in 2003. The number of reported cases among MSM had previously remained sta- ble during the 1990s and early 2000s Median age of MSM at the time of diagnosis remains high. In 2003, the median age was 37 years (range 23-80). Of the 57 reported cases, 32were in patients who were thought to have acquired their infection in Oslo, 3 in other Norwegian cities, 15 abroad, and in 7 cases the place ofinfection was unknown. Thirty two MSM reported that they were mostlikely to have been infected by a casual sexual partner, 11 reported thatthey were infected by their regular partner, while in 14 cases, no furtherinformation about the sexual relationship was available. There is no satisfactory data on behavioural surveillance for MSM in Norway. HIV test activity is monitored by regular questionnaire stud-ies carried out at social venues in Oslo where gay men gather. In the2003 study, 87% of the gay men reported that they had taken an HIVtest at least once. This was a slight increase compared with 1998, when 80% reported having had an HIV test. There have been no majorchanges in the HIV reporting system since its introduction in 1985. In the Norwegian HIV surveillance system, the time of infection is estimated for every reported case of newly diagnosed HIV infection(except for HIV infections among immigrants infected before enter-ing Norway). This estimate is based on previous negative test, clini-cal signs of primary HIV infection or other individual epidemiologicaldata (F IGURE ). Fifty four per cent (31/57) of the cases reported in MSM in 2003 are estimated to have been infected in 2003, while 16%(9/57) were estimated to be new infections in 2002. DiscussionThe sudden increase in the number of MSM infected with HIV in Oslo in 2003 is of great concern and can be seen as a local outbreakof HIV . This increase can not be explained by changes in the report-ing system although there is data available which indicates higherHIV test activity among MSM. Many of the patients are thought tohave been infected at venues for casual sex such as gay saunas. Duringthe past four years, an increasing number of cases of syphilis andgonorrhoea connected to these venues has been reported in Oslo (4). Rising incidence of other sexually transmitted infections in MSM sug- gests that unsafe sex practices at such venues may be more risky todaythan at any time since the early 1980s. The reason for this change in be-haviour is probably complex and must be seen within an internationalperspective of increased risk behaviour among MSM. More behav-ioural data is needed in order to develop effective prevention strategies. The most urgent public health measure to be taken now is to in- form the gay community about the increased risk of acquiring HIVand other sexually transmitted infections in Oslo and other majorEuropean cities. This can be achieved by increased outreach activity by the Norwegian gay health committee and health authorities in Oslo. Cooperation with gay sauna owners is an essential part of thiswork.The internet (including chat sites for MSM) will be actively used to disseminate information.N\u00b0 of cases 05101520253035 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 Unknown Estimated vear of infection FIGURE Newly diagnosed HIV infection among MSM in Norway 2003 by estimated time of infection.References: 1.

Since 1 January 2002, data on all newly diagnosed HIV infected in- dividuals in the Netherlands have been collected by the Stichting HIVMonitoring (HIV Monitoring Foundation or HMF, http://www.hiv- monitoring.nl) in Amsterdam (1). The goal of the HMF is to moni-tor HIV infected individuals seen in the 22 HIV treatment centres in the Netherlands in order to study changes in the epidemic, the natu-ral history of HIV and the effects of treatment. HIV/AIDS registra- tion in the Netherlands is different from in other European countires,as it is a clinical cohort, based on the 22 HIV treatment centres.Individuals enter the cohort after an HIV positive diagnosis, and are followed over time. AIDS diagnoses are registered in the same cohort.Previously diagnosed HIV infected individuals are included in the HMF cohort retrospectively. Between 1 January 2002 and 1 August 2003, 8496 HIV infected individuals were registered in the HMF cohort (78% male and 22%female). Forty five per cent of those diagnosed with HIV were seen intreatment centres in the city of Amsterdam. Men who have sex with men (MSM) form the largest group (51%), followed by men andwomen who have acquired their infection heterosexually (27%). The number of heterosexually acquired HIV infections has increased over time, due to rising numbers of individuals originating from sub-Saharan Africa (1, 2). Figure 1 shows a peak in the newly diagnosed HIV infections among MSM in 1996-1997 and in 2001-2002. The rise in HIV diag-noses among MSM in these periods is likely due to an increased will-ingness to test following the availability of HAART (1996-1997) andan effect of the start of the official registration in 2002 (2001-2002).There was a steady increase in the number of HIV infections amongheterosexuals. Among individuals diagnosed in 2002 (n=735), 38% ac-quired the infection through heterosexual contact (T ABLE 1). Half of all heterosexually infected individuals originate from a region with ageneralised HIV epidemic, in particular sub-Saharan Africa. Of the HIV diagnoses in 2002, the percentage in MSM was 46%.Only 1% were injecting drug users, a group that was possibly under-represented. For 12% of the HIV infected individuals, a likely route of transmission has yet to be determined. Table 2 shows the number of HIV infected men and women strat- ified by region of origin. The majority of the individuals originate fromthe Netherlands (59%). The largest non-Dutch group consists of sub-Saharan Africans, accounting for 9% of the men and 42% of thewomen. Of those heterosexually infected, the percentage of sub- Saharan Africans is the same for men as for women. In total, 209 HIV infected children (0-18 years) have been reported in the Netherlands by the Nederlands Signalerings CentrumKindergeneeskunde. Most of the children became infected through mother to child transmission (76%). The percentage of children withone or both parents originating from an HIV endemic country in-creased from 40% in 1995 or earlier (29/73) to 91% in 2002/2003(31/34).

By 1 August 2003, a total of 6076 individuals with AIDS had been registeredin the Netherlands (T ABLE 1). Soon after introduction of HAART in 1996, the number of newly diagnosed AIDS patientsdeclined sharply: since the year 2000, the number of new AIDSdiagnoses has stabilised at 220-40 per year. This trend towardsstability is likely to be related to the relative increase of new di-agnoses among individuals from HIV endemic regions amongAIDS cases; a similar pattern can be observed in other west-ern European countries. The percentage of women among allAIDS patients more than doubled from 12% in 1994 to 27%in 2002. Although the number of new AIDS diagnoses hasstabilised since the year 2000, HIV associated deaths in theNetherlands have continued to decline (3). Further expansion of surveillance activities in the Netherlands is necessary in the light of these trends. HIV in- cidence studies, one of several new initiatives, are being set upto facilitate rapid detection of changes in HIV transmission in the Netherlands. Moreover, the ongoing increase of sexuallytransmitted diseases in the Netherlands suggests an increase of unsafe sex practices in certain populations (e.g. MSM).Behavioural surveillance needs to be strengthened in orderto understand the determinants of unprotected sex.

In response to the heatwave related mortality in France in sum-mer 2003, it is interesting to note that three fellows from the EuropeanProgramme for Intervention Epidemiology Training (EPIET) and six fellows from the French National training programme in FieldEpidemiology (PROFET) were involved in the response to the heat- wave in France, particularly in investigations and epidemiologicalstudies carried out in nursing homes (personal communication, AlainMoren, 9 March 2004). 48 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 1-3 N\u00b0 of cases300 250 200 150 100MSM heterosexual contact injection drug use blood (products) mother to child needle stick injury other/unknown50 0 <1985 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 19931994 1995 1996 19971998 1999 2000 2001 2002*350400FIGURE 1 Number of HIV infected individuals in the Netherlands, stratified by year of diagnosis and route of transmission (source: HMF). * Possibly incomplete due to reporting delay.

Spain 59Evaluat ion in progress-8TABLE Provisional estimates for mortality attributed to heatwave event, by countryThe French experience in 2003 shows that heatwaves in the European Region have not previously been considered a serious risk to human health with 'epidemic' features. Basic questions such as whether or not a heatwave can be predicted, detected or prevented, and how respond to it, must be addressed (1). In August 2003, Europe lay sweltering under a heatwave. Although the hot weather was initially welcome, a more sinister outcome soonbecame apparent. As France experienced the highest temperatures for50 years, more than 14 000 people died than would have be expectedfor that time of year. Paris experienced the highest nighttime tem-peratures ever recorded on 11 and 12 August (25.5 oC), and death rates more than doubled. The heatwave was unusual in that it af- fected several countries and persisted for at least 10 days; in fact thewhole summer (June, July, August) was much hotter than usual (2). This paper summarises the preliminary findings officially reported from several countries of the effects of this heatwave on total mor-tality (T ABLE). The estimates compare observed deaths in a defined pe- riod with those expected during the same period in previous years. Estimates are sensitive to the method used to calculate the 'expected'mortality. Further, countries experienced differing exposures in termsof magnitude, duration and levels of weather variables, such as hu-midity, which makes direct comparison of impacts between countriesdifficult. Due to inherent delays in the death registration systems, itwill be at least a year before the total burden of the heatwave can be formally estimated from complete mortality datasets. The preliminary results in the table show that there is a lack of in- formation on the number of reported deaths due to classical heatillnesses. Lessons learned from other countries have shown that mostexcess deaths are due to other causes such as cardiovascular and res- piratory diseases. Data from France indicate that the main burden ofexcess mortality was in those aged 75 and over, and across a wide range of causes of death. More than 60% of these deaths occurred in hospitals, private healthcare institutions and retirement homes (4). Although the heatwave affected most of western Europe, there were important spatial variations, with some cities in central France reporting more than 100% increases in mortality during the heatwave. High levels of air pollution (tropospheric ozone) were recorded in Paris, London and other cities, and there is a need to understand better the interactions between air pollutants and temperature ex-posures. It is also possible that death rates will have fallen after theheatwave because of some short term displacement in mortality of thevery ill. More detailed investigatio ns of the impact of the heatwave can be expected from research groups throughout Europe this year. The summer of 2003 has shown that Europe is vulnerable to the effects of heatwaves on human health. A number of concomitantfactors contributed to the high excess mortality in some countries, suchas the unexpected length and intensity of the heatwave, a lack of pre-paredness of healthcare and social systems for such an extreme eventand the lack of community-based intervention plans. Local and na-tional governments need to start thinking about whether they shoulddevelop heatwave intervention plans. The World Health Organizationhas recommendations for short term and long term strategies for re-ducing the health impacts of heatwaves (9). References: 1. WHO Regional Office for Europe.

These hypotheses were tested in a second, larger, national case-con-trol study. An unmatched prospective study was undertaken. Cases were adults, resident in England and Wales, who had not travelled abroadwithin the incubation period, with laboratory confirmed S. Enteritidis PT14b infection. Structured interviews were conducted over the tele-phone. Asymptomatic controls were recruited through systematic se-quential dialling, based on the cases' telephone numbers. Interviewswere conducted in the early evenings and at weekends to maximise case response and to ensure that controls represented the population from which the cases arose (see T ABLE ). Logistic regression analyses were employed to allow for confounding variables such as age and sex. Three models were used to examinethe hypotheses concerning egg consumption and types of premises.When the premises type was examined alongside consumption of eggs outside the home, eating eggs away from home was independ-ently associated with being a case of S. Enteritidis PT14b infection (OR=5.02; 95%CI= 2.09-12.05; P<0.001). Prior to PT14b accounted for less than 200 lab- oratory confirmed cases a year. Since 2001 the annual totals have risensharply, the provisional total for 2003 being 922 cases. In 2002 a largenational outbreak of S. Enteritidis PT14b was associated with buying food from local bakers' shops, eating from sandwich bars and buyingfood from local butchers' shops (2). During the investigation of anumber of S. Enteritidis outbreaks in 2002, S. Enteritidis PT14b was isolated from eggs originating from Spain (3). Molecular typing by plas-mid analysis and pulsed field gel electrophoresis showed that clinicalisolates from outbreak cases of PT14b in 2003 were indistinguish-able from outbreak related clinical and egg isolates of this phage typein 2002. This suggests that the PT14b outbreak in 2003 might have beena continuation of the 2002 situation, probably resulting from thesame source. The United Kingdom Food Standards Agency's advice to caterers is that raw shell eggs should not be used in any food that will not becooked (or will only be lightly cooked) (4). *Editor's note: The lion mark on British eggs certifies that the egg laying flock has been vaccinated against Salmonella.

Published online 22 January 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/040122.asp) Infectious diseases associated with injecting drug use (IDU), such as HIV and hepatitis B and C, are an important cause of mortality and morbidity among young people in Europe and cause high costs to so-ciety (1-4). Hepatitis B, C and HIV prevalence are highly concen-trated among IDUs (5-7), forming a constant threat of transmission to the wider population. Prevalence of HCV in injecting drug users (IDUs) is high overall in the European Union (30-90%), but may be slowly declining, while 50 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 1-3 Fifty five cases and 102 controls were included in the analyses. In the single variable analysis, cases were more likely to report : travel within the UK (estimated odds ratio (OR)=4.42; 95% confidence intervals (CI)=1.50-13.05; P Value = 0.003) consuming eggs away from home (OR=5.27; 95%CI = 2.12-13.12;P= 0.0001) consuming food from commercial catering premises (OR=2.93; 95%CI=1.39-6.16; P=0.003) consuming sandwiches bought outside the home (OR=3.07; 95%CI=1.39-6.77; P=0.003) consuming egg sandwiches outside the home (OR=4.09; P=0.05) eating food from Chinese restaurants (OR=3.56; eating eggs in Chinese restaurants (OR=3.80; 95%CI=1.17-12.27; eating chicken dishes in Chinese restaurants (OR=4.17; 95%CI=1.16-14.95; P=0.02) They were less likely to report : of 'L ion marked '* eggs chicken in the home (OR=0.45; 95%CI=0.22-0.93; cooking raw chicken in the home (OR=0.29; 95%CI=0.12-0.72; P=0.005)TABLEHIV shows marked variation in prevalence (1-30%) and trends between countries (5). However, high prevalence in new and young injectors demonstrates recently recenttransmission (F IGURES 1-3) and increases in HIV and HCV prevalence or incidence are again reported in several areas,including some where prevalence was historically low(5,6,8). Absolute numbers are also large, as IDUs may con-stitute up to a half percent of the adult population in theEU (5). Drug injecting is the major determinant of bloodborne infections, such as HIV and hepatitis B and C. In IDUs, in-jecting can also be a major risk factor for transmission ofother infections such as tetanus, HTLV , malaria, syphilis,hepatitis A, wound botulism and GBV-C (6, 19). In theEU, drug injecting is mostly associated with problematicopiate use, although Sweden and Finland report large num-bers of amphetamine injectors, and cocaine use is in-creasing among (former) problem opiate users (5). Datafrom drug treatment suggest that injecting drug use has de-clined during the 1990s in some countries, but not in oth-ers (Fig 4). Recent national estimates of injecting vary from2 to 6 injectors per 1000 population aged 15 to 64 (5,9). Intotal there are an estimated 600 000 to 900 000 active IDUs in the 15 EU countries, of whom about two thirds are in-fected with HCV (5,10). Drug injecting is on the rise in thenew EU countries of Central Europe and large HIV out-breaks in IDUs have been reported in the Baltic countries(11,20). Prevention of infections in IDUs is difficult, but some effective measures exist. Needle exchange and methadonemaintenance are cost-effective to prevent HIV (10,12,13)and possibly also HCV (13). These and other measuressuch as HBV vaccination and HIV testing and counsellingare being implemented in all 15 EU countries, but cover-age of IDUs by most measures is poor in some coun-tries(5,14), while the situation is worse in most new EU countries (11). Despite rapid improvements in highly ac- tive antiviral treatments, access to treatment of IDUs mayvary between sub-optimal for HIV (15) to very low in thecase of HCV (16). The EMCDDA is coordinating an EU-wide expert net- work on drug related infectious diseases. This includes routine collection and analysis of existing data on preva- lence and interventions (5), collaboration between exist-ing and new sero-behavioural studies in IDUs (17), as wellas early warning in cases of outbreaks of serious illness inIDUs related to injectable drugs (18). Work in close col-laboration with national focal points, other partner insti-tutions, and related expert networks has resulted inexpanded EU datasets and yearly EU analyses on prevalence and trends of HIV , HCV and HBV in IDUs and IDU-spe-cific interventions (5).

Clinical studies undertaken so far have shown that it is well tolerated and effective against multidrug resistantPlasmodium falciparum isolates (1). The European Network for Surveillance of Imported Infectious Diseases (TropNetEurop, http://www.tropnet.net) has recently conducted a survey of prescriptionpolicies of Mala roneacross Europe, and the results are presented below. With growing international travel and the continued spread of antimalarial drug resistance, the new fixed dose combination is recog-nised to be an agent that is not only effective for the prophylaxis ofmalaria but may be better tolerated than other commonly used an-timalarial drugs (2). Compared with mefloquine, travellers receivingMalarone have been shown to have a lower frequency of both treat- ment related neuropsychiatric adverse events and treatment relatedevents that caused prophylaxis to be discontinued (3). Both atovaquone and proguanil have causal prophylactic activity against the hepatic stages of P.falciparum ,which allows prophylaxis to be stopped seven days after leaving a malaria endemic area. For these reasons, Mala roneis a frequently used prophylactic agent by short term travellers to malaria endemic areas. In travellers who are prepared to pay the high price, the drug com- bination is also attractive for long term prophylaxis. Since initialstudies were limited to 28 days of intake, the European licence wasgranted for this time period. There is no current evidence suggesting long term use may result in adverse events or toxicity, and the rec-ommendation for its extended use is currently being examined by ex-perts. In order to summarise the current practise regarding Malarone and its long term use, TropNetEurop conducted a survey of officialsin its 46 member countries.EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue 1-3 / w w w .eurosurveillance.org 53Country Long-term use National expert body URL of expert body Comments Austria Maximum 3 monthsBoard for Travel Medicine, Austrian Society for Tropical Medicine and Parasi tologyhttp://www.vu- wien.ac.at/i116/OeGTPhome.html BelgiumLong term use of Malarone is not advised against for me dical reason s, only because ofhigh costs.

Data gained from a poll conducted among TropNetEurop members in January 200454 EUROSURVEILLANCE 2004 VOL.9 Issue IgG anti-HA V increases from 2% in 5-7 year old children of Turkish origin to 22% in 14-16 year olds. In children of families of Moroccan ori-gin, this increases from 10% in the youngest group to 58% in the oldest group. This is in contrast to Dutch children whose parents are of west- ern European origin, where these figures were 0.3 and 3% respectively.This study suggests that the majority of children of Moroccan and Turkishorigin aged 5-16 years are not protected against HA V , and may be at highrisk of becoming infected while visiting their country of origin (4). In the Netherlands, vaccination of children of families of immigrant origin beyond that of the normal programme is still not a national vac-cination policy, due to cost-benefit and ethical issues. National healthinsurance does not cover HA V vaccination. Therefore, depending onthe regional perception of the problem, and the availability of personneland money, the 40 GGDs in the Netherlands are left to organise theirown regional programmes. In about 25% of regions, a targeted hep- atitis A vaccination program is offered via different schemes. Children of families of immigrant origin often travel to the fam- ily's country of origin without proper infection control precau-tions, including active HA V vaccination. In the last few years, Dutchmunicipal health services (GGD) have organised different public health initiatives targeted at this risk group to encourage these chil-dren to be vaccinated against HA V , both to protect these individualsand reduce HA V transmission in the general community. Hepatitis Avaccination projects could be of interest to other European countrieswhich have large populations of children of Turkish, Moroccan or other non-western European origin. The GGDs of South Limburg have introduced such a project for 1- 16 year olds in June each year (5). The total population of SouthLimburg is approximately 650 000, of which 3100 are of Turkish and7200 of Moroccan origin. This immigrant population resides mainlyin the three major cities of South Limburg. A non-discriminatory ap-proach was used in which children of families of immigrant origin aswell as children of native Dutch families could obtain a 'cheap' HA V vaccination for the price of _17 instead of _35 in June 2003. Parentsonly had to pay for the cost of the vaccine. The month of June was cho-sen as many people prepare for their summer holiday then. Localnewspapers gave considerable attention to the vaccination campaign.The Turkish and Moroccan communities were approached throughcommunity outreach, and flyers were distributed in local mosques. Information was also distributed via a Turkish women's network. Of a total of 800 children vaccinated during the campaign month, 124 (16%) of these were children of families of immigrant origin.52% of all 800 children went on holiday to Turkey. Of the children whowent to Turkey, 17% went to visit family members living there. The other half of the vaccinated children went mostly to countries such asMorocco,Egypt, Tunisia, Mexico, Brazil and Indonesia. Fifteen per cent of this group visited family in Morocco. 2003 was the second year this approach has been tried. In 2002, 530 of these vaccinations were given to children in June. Another 500were vaccinated in the other months of that year. Besides the 800 vac- cinations in the campaign month, another 700 children were vacci-nated against HA V at the normal price during the rest of 2003. In2004, we are planning to expand the campaign by adding a targetedpromotion in 200 primary schools and a yellow information leafletwhich will invite parents of nine year olds to have their children vac-cinated against hepatitis A at the same time as the children are par-ticipating in the national child vaccination programme The impact of this vaccination campaign on regional incidence is difficult to estimate, as the numbers are too low to detect fluctua-tions, and surveillance data is almost always an underestimate. However,a substantial number of children of immigrant origin were vacci-nated during that one month. It is hoped that the coverage of the total group at risk will increase if this project is repeated each year. In 2004, our goal will be to increaseHA V awareness by disseminating information in all primary schools,and lowering perceived risks of the vaccine by connecting it to thenational vaccination programme for 9 year olds.As seen from the table, 15 nations responded. The recommendations for the long term use of Malarone varied widely. Expert committees in several countries adhere to the 28 days as detailed in the product infor-mation throughout Europe, while others recommend it for longer pe-riods. The United States Food and Drug Administration approval did not restrict the long term use of Malarone (4). Experience of longer term use is now becoming available (5,6). Across Europe, despite access to simi-lar information, expert bodies have different interpretations of the data. A uniform European recommendation for malaria prophylaxis would be an ideal, however a start would be comparable recom- mendation for the use of Malarone for all European Union citizens. These recommendations need to be formulated by a non-commer-cial organisation staffed by regional experts from across Europe.Established networks including TropNetEurop could support such anorganisation and information flow across European advisory com-mittees and travel clinics.

EXPERIENCEOFAH EPATITIS A VACCINATIO NP R O J E C T FOR CHILDREN OF IMMIGRANT ORIGIN IN THE NETHERLANDS C Hoebe, K Vrijman, Department of Infectious Diseases, Western and Eastern South Limb urg Municipal Health Service, Heerlen, the Netherlands. Published online 4 March 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/040304.asp) Post-summer peaks in hepatitis A (HA V) incidence have been ob- served in the Netherlands related to children of Turkish and Moroccan immigrant parents after visiting their countries of origin (1). This in-crease in cases is reflected in regional outbreaks of HA V in primaryschools and daycare centres for children (2). The phenomenon ofsmall HA V outbreaks occurs every autumn, particularly in cities witha relatively large immigrant populat ion (3). In the Dutch popula- tion - as in most other European populations - there is an absenceof herd immunity to HA V . HA V transmission in the Netherlands ap-pears to be limited to these seasonal peaks. The Dutch incidence of notified cases of HA V has stabilised over the past three decades at around 4 to 7 reported cases per 100 000 inhabi-tants annually. Nevertheless, there has been a notable decrease in inci-dence in the last two years to 2.7 per 100 000 inhabitants in 2002 and2.3 in 2003. Vaccination projects targeted at immigrants from Turkeyand Morocco and their families may have played a role in this decline. About 60% of the annual HA V cases in the Netherlands occur in children under 16 years of age, and particularly in the 5-9 year old group (1).

MAINT AINING HIGH COVERAGE POLIO VACCINATION BEYOND GLOBAL ERADICATION OF WILD TYPE POLIOMYELITIS TH o v i1, S Wassilak2 1Department of Microbiology, National Public Health Institute (KTL), Helsinki, Finland 2World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe, Copenhagen, Denmark Published online 22 January 2004 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/040122.asp) In 1988, the World Health Assembly established the goal of eradi- cation of poliomyelitis by 2000. At the time, there were approximately 350 000 cases in 125 countries. Although the initial goal of the polioeradication initiative (PEI) was not reached by the target date, progressto date has been impressive. Of the 667 provisionally reported cases for 2003 (as of 19 January 2004), 644 occurred in the remaining six endemiccountries; the 23 cases in seven other countries were due to imported virus, often with subsequent transmission (http://www.polioeradica- tion.org/vaccines/polioeradication/all/global/casecount.asp). Wild poliovirus transmission must be interrupted as soon as pos- sible in the remaining endemic countries to avoid any further in-crease in importation related outbreaks in areas with weak primaryhealthcare. Encouraging progress in this respect has been recentlyseen in northern India, but less so in Nigeria and Pakistan, the two otherremaining major endemic areas. Financial constraints and incom- plete implementation of World Health Organization (WHO) strate-gies remain the greatest threats to the initiative. In addition to routine childhood immunisation, high coverage campaigns with the oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) targeted at childrenunder 5 years of age have been instrumental to the global success ofPEI. OPV is easy to administer, and has the dual advantages of being less expensive and providing a better herd immunity than the alter-native, the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). Both vaccines give thevaccinee protection from paralytic poliomyelitis. It is well knownthat OPV may very rarely cause a serious complication: vaccine as-sociated paralytic poliomyelitis (V APP). This may emerge in the vac-cinee or in a close contact and is due to functional reverse mutationsin the viral genome during replication in the human body. As a result,the attenuated vaccine virus may regain the neurovirulent pheno-type. Incidence figures reported for V APP vary, but one frequently cited is about 1 V APP case per 500 000 first OPV doses administered, andless than 5% of this risk after the subsequent doses (1). Supplementary immunization campaigns with OPV and focal house-to-house immunization in the highest transmission areas re-main the strategies to vaccinate every child in the remaining endemicand neighbouring countries, in order to reach the goal of PEI. Onthe other hand, risk of V APP is the main reason that industrialisedcountries, which have used OPV in the past and have long been freefrom endemic poliovirus circulation, are in the process of changingtheir vaccination schedule. In the 52 countries of the WHO EuropeanRegion, which was certified free of polio in June 2002, immunisation policies have varied since the introduction of OPV . Some countries havehistorically used IPV exclusively in routine immunisations (Finland,Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands), whereas others had a policy of universal OPV use but have since changed to use of IPV ,some with sequential use of OPV . Currently, 21 countries use IPVexclusively for childhood immunisation (including all European Union member states except for the United Kingdom), eight have a policy of sequential use of IPV followed by OPV (Belarus, Croatia,Hungary, Israel, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine) and the re- maining continue to have a policy of exclusive OPV use. WHO has recently issued a position paper on the use of IPV (2). In developing countries, where immunisation is carried out accord- ing to the early infancy schedule (6, 10 and 14 weeks of age; WHO im-munisation recommendations for developing countries), IPV given at this time may result in limited seroconversion rates, thus preventingany change in policy. Countries considering a change to IPV should conduct a thorough eval- uation, including the observed risks and potential burden of V APP , thepolitical and public perception of OPV related adverse events, possible im-pact on vaccine acceptance, the operational implications of a change (re-sulting from the need for single dose vaccine supplies, and includingrefrigerator space implications, etc.), and, in particular, financial impli- cations of IPV use. Exclusive use of IPV in immunisation against po-liomyelitis requires the vaccination coverage to be very high, preferablyabove 95%, to overcome any concern about limited herd immunity, It is important to note that lowered immunisation coverage may also have serious consequences in countries that use OPV , as was re-cently demonstrated by outbreaks of poliomyelitis due to circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (VDPV) in Hispaniola, (DominicanRepublic and Haiti) (3), the Philippines (4) and Madagascar (5). The picture is complicated by reports of isolation of VDPV strains fromsewage in the Palestinian Autonomous Areas (6), in Estonia (7) andin Slovakia (TH and coworkers, unpublished). Consequently, highcoverage of polio vaccination is not only important in the period un- til the eradication of the wild type polioviruses from human circula-tion, but for as long as live OPV is in use. WHO has developed astrategic plan for 2004-2008 to achieve and maintain polio eradica-tion that includes the explicit goal of stopping routine immunisationwith OPV as soon as possible after certification of global eradication. It also includes continued virological surveillance, provision of global vaccine stockpiles and continuation of a process for secure laboratorycontainment of wild and vaccine derived poliovirus. The cessation of OPV use could potentially be recommended before 2010. References: 1. Nkowane B, Wassilak S, Orenstein W, Bart A, Kew O. Vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis.
