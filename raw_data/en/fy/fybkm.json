The directorate met three and exceeded four out of ten accountability indicators against this output and did not meet the other three targets. The targets exceeded by more than 5% were: Percentage of services completed online - where there has been a greater than forecast take up of online services (including online Driver Licence renewals); Compliance rate during targeted campaign inspections - where the effectiveness in initial and on- going engagement has meant that there has been less requirement for education and/or enforcement activities; and Compliance activities: engage, educate, enforce - as effectiveness in initial and on- going engagement has meant that there has been less requirement for education and/or enforcement activities. The targets not met by more than 5% were: Percentage of the Canberra community satisfied with the ease of interacting with Access Canberra - where the overall ease of dealing rating remained steady from 2016-17. The rating for ease of dealing was anticipated to increase with additional digital service offerings but this has not occurred; and Reduction of regulatory burden on business by undertaking risk- based coordinated inspection activities - where due to a change in circumstances there was a need to delay the completion of two planned programs until 2018-19. This reduction in planned activity levels has contributed to the result. Future Direction In 2018 -19, the directorate will continue to: expand the digital service offering, aiming for 80% of services being available digitally by 2020; evaluate, and where necessary adapt our service delivery model to harness changes in technology and better deliver services to the community; apply a risk based approach to regulation and compliance to ensure attention is focused on the areas of greatest harm to the community; use various sources of intelligence and data to better inform our compliance and engagement activities with the community and regulated industries; engage with and educate industries to ensure they understand their obligations under legislation; identify further opportunities for coordinated compliance activities across a range of regulatory responsibilities; help grow and diversify the economy by reducing red tape and working with industry, particularly the hospitality and gaming industries, and the events sector; provide support to the Gambling and Racing Commission; provide regulatory oversight of Light Rail development including the dedicated allocation of three WorkSafe ACT inspectors to monitor health and safety on worksites; and focus on proactive initiatives and targeted workplace inspections based on complaints monitoring and data intelligence.

Highlights In 2017 -18 against this output the directorate: contributed to a reduction of more th an 20% in the rate of serious workplace injuries in the ACT Public Sector through the WoG injury prevention and management initiatives. These initiatives included; early intervention physiotherapy services for injured workers; enhancements to information technology systems used to prevent and manage work injury ; and refinement of rehabilitation case management practices and supporting systems. An independent audit of the directorate 's rehabilitation management system reported a 100% compliance rate with the applicable Commonwealth guidelines for the second year in a row. The directorate met or exceeded five out of six accountability indicators against this output. The target not met was : Conduct of an actuarial review of the ACT priva te sector Worker's Co mpensation Scheme - the target required the production of an actuarial review report for the private sector workers' compensation scheme by April 2018, however, publication was delayed until May 2018. Targets that were exceeded were Achieve a conformance rating of 85% or higher in the annual audit of the ACT Government Rehabilitation Management System - which required that an audit of the WoG rehabilitation management system returned a conformance rating of 85% or more. The audit found a 100 % compliance ra ting. The rehabilitation management system is integral for providing injured public servants with early and effective return to work support; Provide policy advice on issues relating to industrial relations, injury management, work safety, and dangerous su bstances regulation - which examines the volume of policy advice provided t o Government, was exceeded by 20 %, due to a higher than forecast number of legislative policy matters considered during 201 7-18; Represent the ACT and coordinate activities arising from, national industrial relations, work safety and injury management forums - which examines the number of national policy forums contributed to, was exceeded by 29% due to a higher than forecast range of work safety and workers' compensation matters con sidered by Safe Work Australia; and Reduce the ACT public sector incidence of serious workplace injury - which measures the number of serious work related injuries across the public sector. The target for this indicator indicates the degree of improvement required for the ACT public sector to meet national work health and safety strategy targets by 2022. The level of improvement achieved was 21 % better than required and means the ACTPS is well on its way to achieving injury reduction targets. Future Direction In 2018-19 the directorate will remain focused on reducing the human and economic costs of work injury and improving conditions for working people including through: establishing a workers' compensation self -insurance framework to improve claim management services and return to work outcomes for the public sector; designing and implementing injury reduction strategies for the construction industry, young workers, apprentices and trainees and people involved in insecure work; working with other jurisdictions and SafeWork Australia to finalise the review of national work safety laws and engage with ACT workers, industry and their representative bodies on rolling out any changes arising in the Territory; manage regulatory reforms to the work safety, workers' compensation and workplace relations frameworks; design and deliver new whole of government health and wellbeing and injury prevention initiatives; and review and refine the whole of government work health and safety strategy.

The directorate met or exceeded four of its five 2017-18 accountability indicators against this output: Life of Project PPP transactions successfully executed - (Target 100%, outcome was 100%); Proportion of relevant projects supported by Infrastructure Finance and Capital Works that have had WHS audits performed in accordance with the Active Certification Audit Program - (Target was >90% - outcome 95%); Capital Works Projects: Percentage of Construction Projects Completed on Budget - (Target was 85%, outcome was 100%) ; Percentage of Construction Projects Completed on Time - (Target was 85%, outcome was 100%) Percentage of contracts awarded to prequalified contractors/consultants - (Target was 95%, outcome was 100%) ; and Proportion of relevant contracts managed by Infrastructure Finance and Capital Works that include the requirement for the contractor to hold IRE Certification - (Target was >90%, outcome was 100%). The one accountability indicator the directorate did not meet was: Proportion of Government funded annual Capital Works program supported by Infrastructure Finance and Capital Works - (Target 90%, outcome 61%). The variance of 33% was due to the service offering of the IFCW having expanded, with more ICFW embedded resources providing 'in-house' assistance to directorates to meet their needs. As the delivery model matures and with the introduction of new systems and processes, the indicator as currently measured would be expected to reduce significantly. This indicator will be discontinued as it no longer reflects the nature of the support provided by IFCW to directorates and agencies in delivering the government capital works program. During 2017-18 the directorat e continued to administer and update the following policy frameworks: The Capital Framework; The Partnerships Framework; The Guidelines for Public Private Partnerships; and The Guidelines for Unsolicited Proposals. Future Direction In 2018 -19 the direct orate will continue to take leadership on: Capital Works delivery; WHS Active Certification; The Capital Framework; Government Procurement Act; Government Procurement Board; IRE Certification; Local Industry Participation Policy; the roll out of P -MARS; and the implementation of the Secure Local Jos Code. In addition in 2018 -19 directorate will continue to: work to ensure procurement reforms achieve greater value for money on all major infrastructure projects and goods and services procurements; continue the implementation of P-MARS to provide greater collaboration, project management and reporting capability for Capital Works projects. This will be an internal transformational change process, with the aim of improving the way the Territory controls, manages, forecasts and reports all forms of capital works expenditure, including new works, asset purchases, capital upgrades, capitalised expenditure and ICT capital projects. The new system will be fully implemented in the CMT EDD , Health and Transport Canberra and City Services directorates as part of the first phase, with a view to subsequently rolling it out across all directorates; continue to assist directorates in planning and procuring capital works projects by advising on the processes within The Capital Framework: Investment Logic Workshops, Risk Workshops, Delivery Model Workshops, Early Project Overviews and Business Cases; continue providing secretariat services to an increasing number of large or high risk infrastructure projects and internal government committees and processes. We are also developing and will make available a simplified package to support other d irectorates managing large infrastructure projects ; and facilitate a review of the Capital Delivery which will examine contingency estimation and management, and in particular the appropriate retirement of contingency associated with Secure Local Jobs Code - to consult and work across government and with key stakeholders to implement and operationalise changes to the Government Procurement Act 2001 that will extend Industrial Relations Employment (I RE) Certification requirements over additional industries and provide greater oversight for the ACT Government on obligations applying to companies in those industries that contract with the ACT Government; Project Management and Reporting System (P-MARS) - to develop a new contract and project management system for infrastructure and capital works is well underway and is expected to be available for full testing and WOG implementation in the second half of 2018; Other project involvement - providing secretariat services to an increasing number of large or high risk infrastructure projects and internal government committees and processes.

The response centre received in excess of 14,000 calls and raised over 15,800 work orders during the 2017-18 period. The directorate has two specialist staff who assist ACT Government directorates to develop and implement energy efficiency initiatives. In 2017-18 these staff provided technical advice and support on sustainability initiatives in relation to buildings and sites that consume significant amounts of electricity. These officers also provided advice and support to Building Management Committees that oversee the operation of ACT Government occupied buildings to ensure that energy efficiency targets are met. Highlights In 2017- 18, the directorate: commenced the implementation of the 2017-18 Budget initiative on Smarter Government Spending involving the centralisation of non-specialised property services. This involved working with directorates in a partnership approach to optimise the delivery of the single service model. The aim of the initiative is to release savings from the management of property services in a more coordinated approach including on decision-making and leveraging economies of scale available from the WoG approach. A business readiness program is also underway to prepare ACTPG for its expanded role; expanded the property portfolio with the transfer of five public pools from Active Canberra.

Under the RFT, up to $50,000 of Indigenous Advancement Strategy (IAS) funding was available via Active Canberra to assist in the develo pment a guiding strategy for Boomanulla Oval. In March 2017, Winnunga was successful in securing $49,500 of the IAS funding to develop a guiding strategy for Boomanulla Oval. Winnunga submitted a Strategic Plan as part of its package of preliminary review documents in September 2017. In light of importance and complexities of this project, government took time to ensure close attention was paid to every possibility that might enable Winnunga's proposal to work, but in the end, it wasn't possible. The Terri tory formally ended the Tender process in July 2018. Government is progressing interim restoration works at Boomanulla Oval in consultation with Elected Body and community representatives. This will enable the facility to reopen to the community later in 2 018, and be used for informal recreation and community activities. Interim management and governance arrangements are being considered as part of this process. Standing Committee on Public Accounts Report No.29 Inquiry into 2016 Strategic Review of the Auditor- General - Recommendations of Report Government Response Tabled 9 August 2016 Recommendation No. and summary Action Status Recommendation 1 That a seven year non-renewable appointment term for the ACT AuditorGeneral be reinstated in the Auditor General Act 1996. Government Response - Agreed This recommendation is entirely consistent with the Strategic Reviewer's suggestion of a 710 year nonrenewable term. The Government maintains its support of this suggestion, previously indicated in the Chief Minister's comments to the Committee. This appointment provision has been reinstated in the current Act as section 8AA. Notwithstanding the Government's engagement in this action, the Speaker retains practical responsibility for matters relat ing to the appointment of the Auditor-General. Complete. Recommendation 2 That section 8 of the AuditorGeneral Act 1996 be amended to prescribe that the ACT AuditorGeneral is to be appointed for a term of 7 years and is not eligible for reappointment, including reappointment after the end of that term. Government Response - Agreed Noting the bipartisan agreement to the proposed legislative changes, the Government will commission the preparation of a Bill to introduce legislative amendments in sufficient time to guide the appointment of the next ACT AuditorGeneral, due in 2018. The Legislative Assembly Amendment Bill 2017, introduced by the Speaker in September 2017 and passed by the Assembly in November, included amendments for this purpose. Specifically, Clause 9 of the Bill inserted Section 8AA in the current Act, and prescribes the recommended 7 year non - renewable term of appointment. The Government was engaged in the development of the Bill, however the Speaker retains practical responsibility for matters relating to the appointment of the Auditor-General. Complete.

Government Response - Agreed in principle The Government supports certainty of tenure and continued indep endence of the AuditorGeneral. However, noting that the current AuditorGeneral is appointed for a seven year term, it is unclear whether transitional arrangements are required in this case. The preparation of a Bill to amend the Act, as foreshadowed in t he response to Recommendation 2 above, will give further policy and drafting consideration to this matter. Speaker.

Recommendation 48 The Committee recommends that Access Canberra and the Land Development Agency work with stakeholders involved with the rubbish stockpile in Hume to ensure that environmental and land lease conditions are enforced. Government Response - Agreed Access Canberra, through the Environment Protection Agency, is currently working with the lessee to ensure that th ey adhere to all environmental requirements. Access Canberra is encouraging the lessee to reduce stockpiles of materials to assist in the management of the site. Access Canberra will work with the Land Development Agency as required on the identification a nd management of alternate sites for heavier industrial activity. Southern State Waste Recycling (SSWR) applied for an Environmental Authorisation (EA) covering two activities under the Environment Protection Act 1997; the crushing, grinding and separating of materials and the operation of a transfer station. On 23 March 2017 EA No: 1099 was granted by the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) to SSWR for the crushing, grinding and separating of materials. The EA contained limits on the amount and height of material that can be stored on site. As these limits were significantly less than what was currently on site, these conditions did not come into force until six months after the grant date (i.e. 23 September 2017). Given the amount of material stored on site, the EA also required SSWR to provide a financial assurance. The amount of the financial assurance was set at $250,000 and was provided to the EPA on 26 May 2017. Under the EA, SSWR was also required to submit an Environment Management Plan (EMP). On 27 June 2017 the EPA endorsed the EMP, which contained the necessary management activities and control measures to avoid, minimise or manage environmental impacts in an acceptable manner.

The EPA's observation on site is that the stockpile is being reduced in both height and volume. Environmental Protection officers continue to monitor this activity and remain in communication with the operators of SSWR. Due to site and planning impediments to implementing additional environmental controls, the restrictive nature of both the EA and an Environment Protection Order and impending licensing under the Waste Management and Resource Recovery Act 2016, SSWR closed their operations on 1 March 2018. SSWR surrendered their EA on 16 May 2018. Access Canberra and TCCS are facilitating SSWR's exit from the site. Talks are still underway between Access Canberra, TCCS and SSWR regarding when the exit will be finalised. Recommendation 50 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government outline the long term strategy for managing the risk of increased costs associated with workers' compensation scheme insurance premiums.

Significant resources are directed towards managing the Territory's workers' compensation liabilities, including via the Work Health and Safety and Workers' Compensation Improvement Plan, which has been funded since 2011 -12. Funding of $2.8 million has been directed to the Plan in 2016, to support a suite of mutually reinforcing initiatives including: employment of specialist workers' compensation and injury management staff to increase return to work service standards fo r injured workers; early intervention injury management and staff training programs; improved incident monitoring and response systems and procedures; and the design and implementation a more cost effective workers' compensation scheme within the Territ ory's own legislative jurisdiction. The Improvement Plan has delivered positive returns on investment, having generated more than $20 million in premium cost reductions. Further claim liability improvements are forecast as initiatives continue to be rolle d out. the possibility of becoming a self - insurer for workers' compensation under the Comcare scheme. This approach is responsive to feedback from worker representatives and would mean that the types of compensation workers may currently receive would remain unchanged, however the Territory would exercise greater influence over insurer resourcing and claim management standards. An application for a workers' compensation self -insurance licence has been lodged and is expected to be considered by the licensing authority at its November 2018 meeting.

Government Response - Agreed in principle From 1 July 2016, the Government Contracts Regist er has been improved, and is now located with tenders on the Tenders ACT section of the Procurement website. The new Register enables quicker data entry and search functionality, as well as allowing the exporting of information about selected contracts to a spreadsheet, making it more user -friendly. The Territory will investigate the cost and feasibility of further enhancing the Contracts Register to publish the reason/s where a contract has been notified beyond 30 days after execution. As part of the next scheduled upgrade to the TendersACT system the incumbent service provider will be able to provide the Territory with a report that shows the date a contract was uploaded along with its execution date. This is expected to be available at the end of Septemb er 2018. This upgrade will allow the Territory to determine instances of late contract notification and to report and provide feedback to Directorates. In progress. Recommendation 55 The Committee recommends that the ACT Government consider implementing a system that records details of relevant representations made to the ACT Government.

The Government is sympathetic to the main aim of the Bill, namely to provide Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) with enhanced policy costing services. However, the Government remains opposed to the creation of a Parliamenta ry Budget Office (PBO) in order to achieve that aim. It is not a practical solution to the problem. There is a critical mass of staffing needed to make a PBO properly functional and to have the subject matter expertise and experience to cover the many and diverse portfolio interests in the ACT. The Commonwealth PBO - the only full time, permanent PBO in Australia - has a team of around 45 officers. This represents a ratio of PBO staff to parliamentary members of about 1:5.

A similar ratio of PBO staff to parliamentary members in the ACT would yield a PBO of only five staff; too small to form that critical mass of expertise and experience. It would also be too small to cope with the peak demand of costing requests during election periods. Treasury's experience of costing requests during the 2012 election period would indicate that the PBO would need to expand to around 20 -30 staff during such periods. However, were the PBO to be any larger, it would be significantly out of proportion with the size of the ACT Assembly. Nevertheless, the Government's view is that there would be benefit in further consideration of the Bill, the issues that it raises and p ossible alternative, more practical solutions to the aim of enhancing policy costing services for MLAs, should the next Assembly consider that to be worthwhile.

Recommendation 8 The Committee recommends that ACT Government directorates and agencies' adherence to their Record Management Programs should be reviewed by the Territory Record Office every three years, and that the results of these reviews be published. Government Response - Agreed in principle In 2017 -18 the Territory Records Office will la unch its Better Records Advice and Support Service, which will work with agencies to examine aspects of their records management practices and identify areas for improvement or where good practices can be shared across government. The TRO will use a risk -based approach to identifying areas for review, rather than seeking to cover all areas of government. At this stage the TRO does not intend to publish the results of these reviews, but will use them as a mechanism for working collaboratively with agencies.

Auditor General Report No.1 of 2017 WorkSafe ACT's Management of its Regulatory Responsibilities for the Demolition of Loose -Fill Asbestos Contaminated Houses Government Response Tabled 21 March 2017 Recommendation No. and summary Action Status implementing the Government' s regulation to protect our community and environment; and cutting red tape and improving the connection to regulatory services for individuals and business. These are the two principles that guide Access Canberra's activities. Access Canberra's publicly a vailable Accountability Commitment establishes its overarching regulatory strategy. WorkSafe's Compliance Framework, used in conjunction with the Accountability Commitment, provid es a sector specific framework focused on a risk based approach to compliance and enforcement. This supporting documentation was used by the Asbestos Team within WorkSafe to guide its regulatory response in monitoring the Mr Fluffy demolition program. Notwithstanding the abovementioned governance framework, Access Canberra acknowle dges the recommendation to adopt a dedicated strategy and program specific to the work of the Asbestos Team. Access Canberra has developed and finalised two governance frameworks that will address this recommendation. 1. Regulatory Approach: The purpose of this framework is to clearly articulate the objectives and general principles for WorkSafe ACT's role in the ACT Government Loosefill Asbestos (Mr Fluffy) Insulation Eradication Scheme. 2. Program of Activities: This framework brings together existing doc umentation and procedures to set the regulatory methodology. This documentation covers the continuum of activities involved in this regulatory process, formallyfour mandatory inspection visits and appropriate record keeping. A review of all the case management system action logs and electronic documentation has been audited internally to ensure records are maintained against each property. This review was completed in June 2018.

Recommendation 2 Regulatory Program The program of activities to guide the Asbestos Team's regulation of the demolition of loose- fill asbestos contaminated houses should: a.reflect existing documented guidance from Access Canberra (and theprevious Office of RegulatoryServi ces) in the program's development; b.specify which Asbestos Team workplace inspections are mandatory or discretionary. For discretionary inspections guidance should beprovided on how this is to bedetermined; and c.be regularly reviewed and changesmade in response to performance,emerging risks and lessons learnt.Reasons for changes should beformally documented. Government Response - Agreed Access Canberra has developed a program of activities specific to the operational requirements of the Asbestos Team to address this recommendation. The program of activities brings together existing documentation from across Access Canberra, the previous Office of Regulatory Services and WorkSafe into one comprehensive document. a) New documents have been developed to articulate the aim of the regulatory activity, define outcomes and describe actions tobe taken in achieving the regulatorystrategy: WorkSafe ACT: Regulatory Approach ACT GovernmentLoose -Fill Asbestos (Mr Fluffy) Insulation Eradication Scheme.

ACT Ombudsman Reports ACT Ombudsman Report No.1 of 2016 Investigation of a complaint about certain procurement practices Government Response Tabled Recommendation No. and summary Action Status Recommendation 1 The Procurement Board and PCW review how tenders are initiated, approved and monitored so that PCW has visibility of instances of multiple related procurement activities in order to avoid unnec essary costs to business and Government. Government Response Procurement and Capital Works (PCW) has acquired a new project management and reporting system, which is currently being implemented in Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development, Health, and Transport Canberra and Territory Services Directorates, with a view to eventually rolling it out across government. This system will enable much greater visibility of procurement activities and provide an opportunity for PCW to identify related procurement processes and recommend alternative procurement approaches where appropriate. PCW now known as Infrastructure Finance and Capital Works (IFCW) is continuing with the implementation of a Project Management and Reporting System (PMARS). The technical so lution was delivered by the supplier, Open Windows Software in June 2018. User Acceptance and Testing has been finalised and the system is now ready for implementation. Training will commence with project delivery officers in IFCW and Capital Works of the Transport Canberra and City Services Directorate (TCCS). The implementation of Phase 1 of PMARS, for the three Directorates identified in the Government response, will be complete by December 2018. The decision to roll out to the remaining directorates is dependent on a review of Phase 1, the identification of resourcing and a decision to proceed. All Capital Works projects are expected to eventually be managed and reported through PMARS. In addition to its management and reporting functionality, PMARS will be linked to the TendersACT system to provide greater visibility of procurement activities across government agencies and assist in avoiding the duplication of related procurement activities.

B.4 Risk Management CMTEDD is committed to ensuring that all business and operational processes are underpinned by effective risk management. The d irectorate's approach to risk management is based on the Australian and New Zealand Risk Management Standard (AS/NZS ISO 31000:20 09) ('The Standard'). The Directorate's risk policies, Risk Management Framework and Policy Statement (risk framework), Risk Management Plan (risk plan) , and Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Framework (BC framework) are reviewed every two years to ensure that risk management is effective and continues to support organisational performance. The policy documents were reviewed, updated and endorsed during the period, following consultation with the d irectorate's business areas, senior managers and executive. Existing risks were monitored, reviewed and reported on, as part of the d irectorate's regular review process. Emerging risks were identified and reviewed, to determine if they should be included in the directorate Strategic Risk Register. The CMTEDD Audit and Risk Committee, and Executive Management Group had oversight of risk management activities within the Directorate. Training across the directorate assisted with ensuring that there was a consistent, appropriate application of the risk framework and risk plan, and assisted in increasing the risk management maturity across CMTEDD. Training offered to staff included: Induction; Introduction to Risk Management; and Managing Risks in Projects.

Existing risks were monitored, reviewed and reported on, as part of the d irectorate's regular review process. Emerging risks were identified and reviewed, to determine if they should be included in the directorate Strategic Risk Register. The CMTEDD Audit and Risk Committee, and Executive Management Group had oversight of risk management activities within the Directorate. Training across the directorate assisted with ensuring that there was a consistent, appropriate application of the risk framework and risk plan, and assisted in increasing the risk management maturity across CMTEDD.

Supporting sustainable and innovation trade and investment The Innovation Connect program within Enterprise Canberra supports Canberra-based start-ups to develop innovative products and services. Under the program, a dedicated funding stream supports commercial opportunities within the renewable energy and clean technology sectors. In 2017- 18, the directorate provided matched-funding support to five renewable energy companies to a total of $117,000 as follows: Inez Estelle P Harker-Schuch trading as Serious Futures - a climate science game, Co2peration, that incorporates a world-first pedagogy for 3D gaming to educate students about climate change ; Fillearth Pty Ltd - development of a light weight, portable and compact in novative solar cooker that incorporates a sun tracking mechanism and temperature monitoring through a smartphone app; Solar Blox Pty Ltd - portable and rugged solar energy blocks that can be clicked together to power equipment in a wide array of industries from disaster relief to developing communities ; Restart Charging Services Pty Ltd - an on -demand mobile electric vehicle charging service ; and Energy Storage Rights Pty Ltd - a hydro energy storage lake pump application powered by a floating solar genera tor. Improve water efficiency Infrastructure, Finance and Capital Works (IFCW) works in collaboration with directorates to develop construction project briefs that include sustainability criteria. For example, rainwater harvesting, air quality monitoring, and water efficient landscaping; the use of soil monitoring systems on the fields of play at Manuka Oval and GIO Stadium to reduce water use; the National Arboretum Canberra is working closely with the University of Canberra (UC), as part of the 'Smart Cities and Suburbs Program' on future water efficiency strategies. This includes the use of site specific soil moisture sensors, developed in-house by UC ICT technicians, the sensors will enable accurate automatic irrigation, based on individual tree species requirements. This initiative will both save water, and ensure the improved health of individual tree species ; a major upgrade to the HVAC systems at North Building/Canberra Museum and Gallery was completed, which included replacement of traditional gas fired boilers with high efficiency electric heat pumps in line with the Carbon Neutral Government Framework and 100% renewable electricity by 2020 target. Commissioned in 2017-18 the project will save an average of $120,000 and 263 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per annum over the life of the system ; and new Building Management Systems (BMSs) were installed and commissioned at multiple sites including Shared Services Records and Mail Offices at Mitchell, Woden Library, 255 Canberra Avenue and Mount Rogers Community Centre which will allow more efficient operation of the HVAC systems on site and a subsequent reduction in electricity, gas and associated emissions. Facility upgrades Access Canberra During 2017-18 Access Canberra continued to roll out activity based working (ABW) environments for sites in which Access Canberra staff operate; and in September 2017, Access Canberra started the re-furbishing and re-fitting of level 6, TransAct House in Dickson, to accommodate 148 staff members. Work was complete in November 2017. As at 30 June 2018 there were approximately 100 staff permanently located at TransAct house with many more working from there as an ABW workplace. Energy efficiency and advisory services ACTPG and EPSDD Carbon Neutral Government team co-hosts energy advisors that focus on providing support to directorates in implementing and managing energy efficiency initiatives. These staff are part of the cross-directorate Carbon Neutral Government team. In 2017-18 the team: provided advice on energy efficient initiatives at a number of facilities for various ACT Government directorates, including Canberra Institute of Technology, Community Services Directorate, Cultural Facilities Corporation, Education Directorate, Justice and Community Safety Directorate and Transport Canberra and City Services; provided input to the procurement and design briefs of new facilities, including environmental initiatives of the City and Dickson Office Blocks; coordinated the reuse of energy efficient gas boiler controls from Macarthur House and The Canberra Hospital for use at CIT Bruce and Capital Linen Service, providing both environmental, operational and capital cost savings while reducing waste; provided advice to budget business case submissions and project d elivery teams to ensure sustainability and whole of life costs are adequately addressed and considered in major projects; provided support to the property management and leasing teams to effectively manage Green Lease Schedules and Building Management Committees in line with the National Green Lease Policy (NGLP). This collaborative approach with landlords works towards more energy efficient outcomes in leased office facilities ; managed a WoG electricity tariff review with the utility supplier, on behalf of the ACT Government. The tariff review transitioned a significant number of locations across to a new electricity tariff, saving the ACT Government around $450,000 per annum; increased the use of and advocated for increased use of the Enterprise Sustainability Platform (ESP) to more effectively manage utility consumption and cost at a range of facilities; supported ongoing environmental policy development and review in EPSDD; conducted regular consultation with trades staff and service providers to promote best practice maintenance of HVAC systems; and conducted or coordinated energy audits and feasibility studies into reducing natural gas consumption at a number of sites across Government including Canberra Theatre Centre, 255 Canberra Ave nue, CIT Fyshwick , Belconnen and Tuggeranong Bus Depots.

Reduce waste and recycling Office locations The majority of ongoing CMTEDD locations are ACTSmart Business (recycling) accredited; shared general and shared comingled waste bins have been in place within workspaces and kitchens as well as the removal of individual waste bins in the Canberra Nara Centre, Winyu House, and all ABW offices; CMTEDD offices have a range of recycling options available including: comingle recycling bins; paper and cardboard recycling facilities; organic worm bins; battery recycling stations; mobile phone rec ycling; and toner recycling . all new staff are required to undertake ACTSmart recycling training following the CMTEDD Induction Program. Events and Venues Events ACT participates in the ACTSmart Public Event Recycling Program via a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), working closely with key stakeholders to reduce the generated waste to landfill for all events delivered by the business unit. These events include Floriade, Floriade NightFest, the Canberra Nara Candle Festival , New Year's Eve , Australia Day , Enlighten Festival, Canberra Day, the Canberra Balloon Spectacular and Reconci liation Day; all major and medium scaled events held at Exhibition Park in Canberra participate in the ACTSmart Public event program to recycling facilities are in place, including National Folks Festival, Farmers Market, Canberra Kids Market, Canberra Fashion Market; the major venues (Canberra Stadium, Manuka Oval, Exhibition Park in Canberra, and National Arboretum Canberra) are ACTSmart Business members and have recycling bins located around the venues for use by participants and attendees. Additionally event organisers, caterers and the general public are encouraged to reduce waste, recycle, and to use recyclable and reusable packaging; all major venues (Exhibition Park in Canberra, GIO Stadium, National Arboretum Canberra, and Stromlo Forest Park ) have water bubblers and bottle fill stations installed. In addition to contributing to community health outcomes, this initiative assists in reducing the number of disposable water bottles sold in the ACT; to protect the natural environment, site users at Stromlo Forest Park are required to take all rubbish away; at GIO Stadium, organic waste now goes to the local worm farm at the Australian Institute of Sport ; and at the National Arboretum Canberra, green waste is recycled to mulch on site. Disposal of ICT Assets The rate of turnover of ICT assets, (such as obsolete computer and television equipment, old cables and other ICT hardware) presents a significant waste impact. In 2009 Shared Services ICT engaged a vendor (Capital Easy, now trading as Reuse RecycleIT) to manage the resale and disposal of ICT Assets on behalf of the Territory. The method in which the Territory disposes of ICT devices and associated consumables is crucial in minimising our environmental waste footprint; since the initial engagement of Reuse Recycle no ICT equipment processed through the directorate has been sent to landfill; and the 2017-18 return to consolidated revenue from disposed assets is $238,000. Reduce office paper consumption The directorate has taken a number of initiatives to reduce paper use during t he reporting period includ ing: the launch of Shared Services new website which has moved the Shared Services team and customers onto a digital platform and change the way agencies and staff interact with Shared Services. Since its launch, Shared Services h as received over 62,000 digital work requests. This initiative has contributed a significant reduction of paper use across the government; the i mpleme ntation of a WoG ecologically sustainable business improvement to install the PaperCut software program , as part of Shared Services ICTSmart Modern Strategic Procurement Reform Program . PaperCut is a printing system which only prints when staff access the printer using their ACT Government pass; digitising many of Access Canberra's Licensing and Registrations services making a significant effort to reduce the amount of paper it handles, and reduce its environmental footprint; introduc ing the Shared Services WoG Accounts Payable Invoice Automation system (APIAS). The new system enables most supplier invoices to be received, approved for payment, and paid electronically. The APIAS has contributed to a significant reduction of paper use for invoicing and payment; many business areas within the directorate are mov ing to electronic document storage and record keeping . This has significantly reduced printing and use of paper both operationally and for record keeping ; actively encourag ing ACT Revenue Office clients to receive correspondence electronically, and rate payers are given the option to receive their rates noti ces by email ; and the National Arboretum Canberra uses non -potable water to irrigate the collection at the Arboretum; continued to follow mowing regimes that maintain adequate ground cover to reduce erosion and improve the quality of water captured in dams; and maintained the Discovery Garden at the Arboretum to educate and inform the community about managing water use in the home garden; and continuous c onservation works at Stromlo Forest Park to reduce soil erosion.

The recycled content of paper overall has increased to 88.6%. Reduce transport emission To reduce transport emission, CMTEDD Corporate has actively worked with all business areas to identify fleet emission reduction opportunities such as replacing existing vehicles with electric or hybrid models, or leasing more fuel efficient vehicles when it is operationally feasible. To encourage staff to use active and sustainable transport options, CMTEDD has a shared electric bike fleet and MyWay bus passes available in major office locations. In 2017-18, actions taken during the reporting period by the directorate included: the leasing of five electric vehicles, which have no direct greenhouse gas emissions, using no fuel; additionally the directorate leases 12 hybrid vehicles to reduce the amount of fuel used; a strategic review of fleet utilisation with a plan to reduce overall number of vehicles in the 2018-19 financial year as lease renewals fall due. In the new vehicle bulk order with SG Fleet, the directorate will continue to consider leasing electric/hybrid vehicles, replace petrol vehicles with hybrid model, and return petrol/diesel vehicles when their leases expire; ensuring replaced vehicles are more fuel efficient to reduce emissions, and consider fuel use and carbon emissions in new fleet leases whenever operationally feasible; drafting of a WoG fleet policy which incorporates the appropriate level of environmental considerations in leasing decisions, and allows for a weighted criterion of sustainability to be included in value-for-money evaluations before vehicles are leased; the installation of electronic logbook systems in most fleet vehicles to more easily monitor distance travelled; encouraging staff to use sustainable transport options, including walking and riding e-bikes to travel to close meeting locations, and car pool or use buses to travel to meeting locations served by ACTION buses through the availability of MyWay Cards at most CMTEDD offices; participation in the ACT Government e-bike fleet project with two electric pedal assisted bikes (e-bikes) located at Canberra Nara Centre for staff to use for work travel. Over 120 CMTEDD staff have completed e-bike induction training. The directorate has also developed a shared e-bike access arrangement with other agencies in Dickson, 220 Northbourne Avenue; the introduction a new e-bike fleet at The Canberra Hospital and progression of a shared e-bike fleet arrangement with ACT Health to encourage staff who are located in Woden to use e-bikes for short distance travel; providing a suite of technology options available to assist staff connecting without the need to travel, this includes Meet-Me phone conferencing and WebEx for use with stakeholders outside the ACT Government, and Jabber, teleconferencing and internet-based video conferencing for use within government. The directorate encourages staff to use teleconferencing where possible thereby firstly reducing vehicle use and consequently engine emissions as well as saving travel time for staff. The directorate also encourages staff to using webcams and internet-based video-conferencing for meetings on some key projects that saves on interstate travel; and end of trip facilities are available in most facilities to encourage staff to ride, walk or run to work. Sustainable Procurement Infrastructure Finance and Capital Works (IFCW) administers a Climate Change Adaptation Strategy Implementation Plan to introduce minimum sustainability requirements for capital works; IFCW works in collaboration with directorates to develop construction project briefs that include sustainability criteria. For example, buildings may include a number of measures, such as solar passive design, energy efficient building engineering services, solar panels, rainwater harvesting, air quality monitoring, and water efficient landscaping. Briefs for all construction projects include waste management plans. Tenderers are asked to describe what actions they will take to reduce waste, such as disposal methods and using recycled materials. Project briefs seek advice from tenderers regarding ways to decrease the use of potable water; for example, by installing alternative grass mixtures (that use less water) and planting Australian natives or drought tolerant plants; and IFCW also works in collaboration with directorates to include ecologically sustainable criteria in both the assessment criteria and product or service specifications in procurement where applicable and possible.

Organisation change occurred the reporting year: All ACT Government sportsgrounds and ovals were transferred to TCCS in July 2017, and all Land Development Agency and Urban Renewal sites and assets were transferred to EPSDD in July 2017. Data relate d to these locations were included in the previous year's figure. The directorate's data (for both years' measures with the exception of FTE and paper usage) include the ACT InsuranceAuthority as it cannot be readily separated. 2. For details of FTE figures refer to section B.8 Human Resource Management. 3. For details of Workplace floor area for office locations refer to section C.4 Asset Management. 4. Energy and water data was extracted from the Enterprise Sustainability Platform (ESP) on 20 August 2018. Data completeness in the ESP for current year is 99.95% electricity, 100% gas use, and 95.12% water use. For analysis and reporting purpose the ESP dashboard reports 'accrued' data, which incorporate estimate missing data in the full year performance.5. In some instances data for the prior year has been updated from that previously reported to allow for updates to agency occupancy and historical consumption data and to annual adjustments to the ACT specific electricity emissions factors. 6. The reduction in electricity consumption is due to the transfer of ACT Government sportsgrounds and ovals to TCCS, the consolidation of office accommodation sites, and various energy efficiency measures applied during the reporting year, including LED lighting upgrade, HVAC and BMS system upgrades. 7. Reduction in gas use in 2017-18 is largely due to the consolidation of Access Canberra office locations, and the closure and decommissioning of Macarthur House and Dickson Motor Vehicle Registry. Gas use for space heating is predominately weather dependent. It is reported that the number of heating degree days (HDDs) in 2017-18 was 4% more than the previous year that has contributed to lower gas use for space heating per location. 8. Diesel was used for on-site generators at the National Arboretum Canberra work depots. In 2017-18, the Arboretum has installed a solar PV system with battery storage at work depots to replace the on-site generator. Thus no reported diesel use on site in current year. 9. The net reduction in total vehicle numbers and total distance travelled, relates to the reduction in size of the vehicle fleet and a focus on leasing higher fuel efficiency vehicles including the transition of more vehicles to diesel; and the promotion/update of sustainable transport options. 10. Over 90% of the water use by the directorate in the previous year was to irrigate and maintain ACT Government sportsgrounds and ovals. This function has been transferred to TCCS in 2017-18. This change has contributed to a significant reduction of water use by the directorate. 11. The decrease in paper use relates to the increased use of Electronic Document Records Management Systems, using email and electronic notices to communicate with clients, the introduction of 'PaperCut' printing technology, and transition to Digital Customer Services within Access Canberra and Shared Services. Data related to paper purchased and recycled content for the previous year has been updated to correct the reporting unit in the paper report. 12. The increase in recycled content of paper purchased reflects that most business units have changed their practice to purchase 100% recycled content paper. Monitoring of purchases and communications of the priority of purchasing 100% recycled paper continues. 13. Waste and recycling data has been collected from all CMTEDD locations and has been calculated on a basis of Total (L) = Capacity of bins (L) x No. of bins x No. of times emptied during the reporting years. Data related to locations that have been accredited under the Actsmart Business (Recycling) Program is extracted from the Actsmart scorecards provided by the Actsmart offices at EPSDD. The increase in the amount of recycling materials was mainly due to higher volume of recycling collected in major venues. The amount of waste and recycling material collected in major venues depends on the number and nature of major events that occurred and the number of patrons that attended the events. Reduction of organic recycling in the current year was partly due to the organic food waste in the Canberra Stadium being collected and sent to the worm farm at Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) regularly and not reported in this year's figure. Data related to the previous year has been updated to adjust identified data errors. 14. Waste and recycling data related to major events held by Events ACT (including the Canberra Nara Candle Festival, New Year's Eve in the City, Australia Day Fireworks Spectacular, Symphony in the Park, Canberra Day, Canberra Balloon Spectacular, Floriade, and Enlighten) is reported as a separate line item. Events ACT participates the Actsmart Public Events Program and ensures recycling is in place in all major events. Food oil recycling data is excluded in this report. 15. The reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is largely due to the increased proportion of renewable energy purchased by the ACT Government, and the exclusion of Scope 3 emission in 2017-18. Emissions reported for stationary and transport fuels include Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions only. This aligns with the ACT Government's reporting boundary and commitment to track emissions that are within its operation. Emission factors used to calculate natural gas and fleet fuel are based on the latest National Greenhouse Account (NGA) Factors. A factor of 0.667 kilogram (kg) CO2-e/kilowatt hour (kWh) or 0.667 tonnes (t) CO2-e/megawatt hour (MWh) has been used to calculate electricity emissions (Scope 2) for the 2016-17 period. It is based on actual historical data and is a retrospective adjustment of the original 0.525 factor (Scope 2) used for 2016-17 annual reporting. A factor of 0.455 kilogram (kg) CO2-e/kilowatt hour (kWh) or 0.55 tonne (t) CO2-e/megawatt hour (MWh) has been used to calculate electricity emissions (Scope 2) for the 2017-18 period. The emissions factors include total GreenPower purchases for the ACT is calculated in the third quarter of the respective financial years and are specific to the ACT. The emission factors (Scope 2) reflect the increasing contribution of renewable electricit y generated under the ACT's 100% Renewable Energy Target (RET). Consequently they are lower than those reported in the latest National Greenhouse Accounts (NGA) Factors.

Organisation change occurred the reporting year: All ACT Government sportsgrounds and ovals were transferred to TCCS in July 2017, and all Land Development Agency and Urban Renewal sites and assets were transferred to EPSDD in July 2017. Data relate d to these locations were included in the previous year's figure. The directorate's data (for both years' measures with the exception of FTE and paper usage) include the ACT InsuranceAuthority as it cannot be readily separated. 2. For details of FTE figures refer to section B.8 Human Resource Management. 3. For details of Workplace floor area for office locations refer to section C.4 Asset Management. 4. Energy and water data was extracted from the Enterprise Sustainability Platform (ESP) on 20 August 2018. Data completeness in the ESP for current year is 99.95% electricity, 100% gas use, and 95.12% water use. For analysis and reporting purpose the ESP dashboard reports 'accrued' data, which incorporate estimate missing data in the full year performance. 5. In some instances data for the prior year has been updated from that previously reported to allow for updates to agency occupancy and historical consumption data and to annual adjustments to the ACT specific electricity emissions factors. 6. The reduction in electricity consumption is due to the transfer of ACT Government sportsgrounds and ovals to TCCS, the consolidation of office accommodation sites, and various energy efficiency measures applied during the reporting year, including LED lighting upgrade, HVAC and BMS system upgrades. 7. Reduction in gas use in 2017-18 is largely due to the consolidation of Access Canberra office locations, and the closure and decommissioning of Macarthur House and Dickson Motor Vehicle Registry. Gas use for space heating is predominately weather dependent. It is reported that the number of heating degree days (HDDs) in 2017-18 was 4% more than the previous year that has contributed to lower gas use for space heating per location. 8. Diesel was used for on-site generators at the National Arboretum Canberra work depots. In 2017-18, the Arboretum has installed a solar PV system with battery storage at work depots to replace the on-site generator. Thus no reported diesel use on site in current year. 9. The net reduction in total vehicle numbers and total distance travelled, relates to the reduction in size of the vehicle fleet and a focus on leasing higher fuel efficiency vehicles including the transition of more vehicles to diesel; and the promotion/update of sustainable transport options. 10. Over 90% of the water use by the directorate in the previous year was to irrigate and maintain ACT Government sportsgrounds and ovals. This function has been transferred to TCCS in 2017-18. This change has contributed to a significant reduction of water use by the directorate. 11. The decrease in paper use relates to the increased use of Electronic Document Records Management Systems, using email and electronic notices to communicate with clients, the introduction of 'PaperCut' printing technology, and transition to Digital Customer Services within Access Canberra and Shared Services. Data related to paper purchased and recycled content for the previous year has been updated to correct the reporting unit in the paper report. 12. The increase in recycled content of paper purchased reflects that most business units have changed their practice to purchase 100% recycled content paper. Monitoring of purchases and communications of the priority of purchasing 100% recycled paper continues. 13. Waste and recycling data has been collected from all CMTEDD locations and has been calculated on a basis of Total (L) = Capacity of bins (L) x No. of bins x No. of times emptied during the reporting years. Data related to locations that have been accredited under the Actsmart Business (Recycling) Program is extracted from the Actsmart scorecards provided by the Actsmart offices at EPSDD. The increase in the amount of recycling materials was mainly due to higher volume of recycling collected in major venues. The amount of waste and recycling material collected in major venues depends on the number and nature of major events that occurred and the number of patrons that attended the events. Reduction of organic recycling in the current year was partly due to the organic food waste in the Canberra Stadium being collected and sent to the worm farm at Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) regularly and not reported in this year's figure. Data related to the previous year has been updated to adjust identified data errors. 14. Waste and recycling data related to major events held by Events ACT (including the Canberra Nara Candle Festival, New Year's Eve in the City, Australia Day Fireworks Spectacular, Symphony in the Park, Canberra Day, Canberra Balloon Spectacular, Floriade, and Enlighten) is reported as a separate line item. Events ACT participates the Actsmart Public Events Program and ensures recycling is in place in all major events. Food oil recycling data is excluded in this report. 15. The reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is largely due to the increased proportion of renewable energy purchased by the ACT Government, and the exclusion of Scope 3 emission in 2017-18. Emissions reported for stationary and transport fuels include Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions only. This aligns with the ACT Government's reporting boundary and commitment to track emissions that are within its operation. Emission factors used to calculate natural gas and fleet fuel are based on the latest National Greenhouse Account (NGA) Factors. A factor of 0.667 kilogram (kg) CO2-e/kilowatt hour (kWh) or 0.667 tonnes (t) CO2-e/megawatt hour (MWh) has been used to calculate electricity emissions (Scope 2) for the 2016-17 period. It is based on actual historical data and is a retrospective adjustment of the original 0.525 factor (Scope 2) used for 2016-17 annual reporting. A factor of 0.455 kilogram (kg) CO2-e/kilowatt hour (kWh) or 0.55 tonne (t) CO2-e/megawatt hour (MWh) has been used to calculate electricity emissions (Scope 2) for the 2017-18 period. The emissions factors include total GreenPower purchases for the ACT is calculated in the third quarter of the respective financial years and are specific to the ACT. The emission factors (Scope 2) reflect the increasing contribution of renewable electricit y generated under the ACT's 100% Renewable Energy Target (RET). Consequently they are lower than those reported in the latest National Greenhouse Accounts (NGA) Factors.

The Board has a range of powers to investigate complaints against architects and to discipline those who are found to have acted unprofessionally or incompetently. The Board's functions are to: register architects; investigate complaints given to the Board about registered people and people who have been registered; consider whether it is necessary to take disciplinary action against registered people and people who have been registered and, if it is, to take the necessary action; consider and report to the Minister about issues referred to the Board by the Minister for advice; advise the Minister in relation to the practice of architecture, for example, about codes of professional conduct; further a common and harmonious approach to the administration of legislation about architects by cooperation with local jurisdictions; accredit courses of study in architecture; and provide general advice to consumers about the professional conduct and standards of competence expected of registered architects. The ACT Architects Board is also part of a national network of Boards which administer the state and territory legislation pertaining to Architectural education and the registration of Architects. The eight state and territory architect registration boards are Nominating Bodies of the Architects Accreditation Council of Australia (AACA). AACA was established by the Boards to ensure national consistency in the pathways that lead to registration as an Architect in Australia.

The ACT Architects Board is also part of a national network of Boards which administer the state and territory legislation pertaining to Architectural education and the registration of Architects. The eight state and territory architect registration boards are Nominating Bodies of the Architects Accreditation Council of Australia (AACA). AACA was established by the Boards to ensure national consistency in the pathways that lead to registration as an Architect in Australia. The Architects Board of the ACT is represented by the Registrar and the Board Chair, as are the other state and territory registration boards. The AACA is recognised as the national organisation responsible for advocating, coordinating and facilitating national standards for the registration of architects in Australia and for the recognition of Australian architects overseas by the relevant Registration Authorities. The AACA also has the responsibility for assessment of overseas qualifications in architecture for the purposes of migration to Australia under the Australian Government's Skilled Migration program. In 2017-2018 the Board commenced work a draft code of professional conduct. A final draft was circulated for internal review this year and will be reviewed by the relevant policy agency prior to consultation with the industry. Registrar Functions The role of the Registrar under the Act is to manage the administration of the board and to maintain the register of Architects. Complaints and Disciplinary Actions In each State and Territory of Australia it is a legal requirement that any person using the title Architect, or offering services to the public as an Architect, must be registered with the architect registration Board in that jurisdiction. Architect legislation has been enacted to protect consumers and the public. Only people whose names appear on a state and territory architect registration Board register can use the title 'Architect' in that jurisdiction. Therefore, it is illegal for people to use the title 'Architect' or offer architectural services if they are not on a register of architects in the State or Territory in which they are practicing. Non-compliance with this requirement in the legislation is seen by the Board as a serious matter, and acting against all reasonable efforts to protect consumers and the public, by ensuring that individuals claiming to be architects have the qualifications and experience required by the legislation. During 2017-18 the Board received 2 complaints. National Engagement In October 2017 the Registrar and Board Chair attended the AACA annual forum and Annual General Meeting in Hobart. This meeting was attended by the Registrars and Board chairs from all other Australian jurisdictions. The meeting provided an opportunity for Registrars and Board Chairs to share information about what was happening in each of the jurisdictions and to look at ways to work together in the progression of architecture across Australia.

The AACA also has the responsibility for assessment of overseas qualifications in architecture for the purposes of migration to Australia under the Australian Government's Skilled Migration program. In 2017-2018 the Board commenced work a draft code of professional conduct. A final draft was circulated for internal review this year and will be reviewed by the relevant policy agency prior to consultation with the industry. Registrar Functions The role of the Registrar under the Act is to manage the administration of the board and to maintain the register of Architects. Complaints and Disciplinary Actions In each State and Territory of Australia it is a legal requirement that any person using the title Architect, or offering services to the public as an Architect, must be registered with the architect registration Board in that jurisdiction. Architect legislation has been enacted to protect consumers and the public. Only people whose names appear on a state and territory architect registration Board register can use the title 'Architect' in that jurisdiction. Therefore, it is illegal for people to use the title 'Architect' or offer architectural services if they are not on a register of architects in the State or Territory in which they are practicing. Non-compliance with this requirement in the legislation is seen by the Board as a serious matter, and acting against all reasonable efforts to protect consumers and the public, by ensuring that individuals claiming to be architects have the qualifications and experience required by the legislation. During 2017-18 the Board received 2 complaints. National Engagement In October 2017 the Registrar and Board Chair attended the AACA annual forum and Annual General Meeting in Hobart. This meeting was attended by the Registrars and Board chairs from all other Australian jurisdictions. The meeting provided an opportunity for Registrars and Board Chairs to share information about what was happening in each of the jurisdictions and to look at ways to work together in the progression of architecture across Australia.

The CTP Act is administered by the Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate (CMTEDD). Under section 14 of the CTP Act, the Minister must appoint a public servant as the CT P regulator for up to 5 years. The Executive Director of the Economic and Financial Group (EFG), CMTEDD was appointed by the Minister as the CTP regulator for a period of 5 years commencing from 9 June 2015. The functions of the regulator are supported by the Financial Framework Management and Insurance Branch of EFG, CMTEDD. The regulator's stakeholders include the members of the ACT community, particularly persons injured in motor vehicle accidents, motorists who are required by law to purchase CTP insurance, and the licensed insurers. B.1.1 Principal Objectives The role of the CTP regulator is to regulate the CTP insurance scheme in the ACT under the CTP Act. The objectives of the Act under section 5A are to: continue improving the system of CTP insurance, and the scheme of statutory insurance for uninsured and unidentified vehicles operating in the ACT; promote competition for CTP premiums; keep the costs of insurance at an affordable level; provide for the licensing and supervision of insurers; encourage the speedy resolution of personal injury claims; promote and encourage the rehabilitation of people injured in motor accidents; maintain an accurate register of motor accident claims to help the administration of the statutory insurance scheme and the detection of fraud; and promote measures directed at eliminating or reducing causes of motor accidents and mitigating their results. B.1.2 Functions The functions of the CTP regulator are specified in section 14A of the CTP Act and include: regulating the licensing of CTP insurers; monitoring the behaviour of licensed CTP insurers in relation to their obligations under the Act; improving health outcomes for claimants; monitoring the efficiency of the CTP scheme under the Act and identifying areas for amendment; and ensuring that all premiums meet the fully funded test and are not excessive. B.1.3 Highlights Competition and CTP premium reductions Since the successful introduction of competition to the ACT CTP insurance market commencing in July 2013, the three new Suncorp brand entrants - AAMI, APIA and GIO - have consolidated their position alongside NRMA Insurance in the market. Competition has delivered innovative products and product choice. In addition, during 2017-18, motorists continued to benefit from further reductions in premiums, as shown in Figure 1. Since competition commenced in the ACT CTP market in July 2013 up until 30 June 2018, the average private passenger vehicle premium has fallen by $40.23, or 6.8%. Figure 1 - Fall in CTP premium prices since the introduction of competition CTP Deliberative Democracy Process - Citizens' Jury In 2017 the Government decided to undertake a deliberative democracy process - a citizens' jur y on the CTP insurance scheme. Citizens of the ACT came together to discuss, debate and deliberate on the ACT's CTP scheme. Through this process, the citizens' jury was asked to consider the question: 'What should the objectives of an improved CTP scheme be to best balance the interests of all road users'. The jury, made up of a representative group of Canberrans, first met in October 2017. Over four days the jury heard evidence from injured people and past CTP claimants, as well as medical, legal and insurance experts, including the CTP Regulator. They also considered community feedback and survey results. The objectives set by the jury following that process were: early access to medical treatment; economic support and rehabilitation services; equitable cover for all people injured in a motor Performance Reporting B.1 Organisational Overview The Australian Capital Territory Compulsory Third-Party Insurance Regulator (CTP regulator) is an independent Territory authority established under section 14 of the Road Transport (Third-Party Insurance) Act 2008 (CTP Act) to regulate compulsory third-party (CTP) insurance in the Territory.

They also considered community feedback and survey results. The objectives set by the jury following that process were: early access to medical treatment; economic support and rehabilitation services; equitable cover for all people injured in a motor vehicle accident; greater efficiency and value for money; supporting people to better navigate the scheme and strengthening integrity of the scheme to reduce fraudulent behaviour. The jury handed their report on the objectives for an improved CTP scheme to a Stakeholder Reference Group (SRG). This group included insurers, the legal profession, a health care consumer representative, a rehabilitation researcher and representatives of the ACT Government which included the CTP Regulator, as well as a scheme designer and actuary. An expert scheme designer, with input from the SRG, developed four models in line with the jury's priorities. These models were costed by an actuary to determine their potential impact on the premiums driver's pay. The jury met for the final time in March 2018 and determined which model best met their priorities. The model chosen by the jury delivers the following improvements: everyone injured in a motor vehicle accident will receive up to five years treatment, care and income benefits, regardless of who was at-fault; quality of life benefits, which provide compensation for non-financial loss, will be available for all people who meet injury thresholds; and anyone whose injury was caused by someone else's negligence and who is more seriously injured will still be able to access additional common law benefits. The jury decided this model best met the objectives they set when they first commenced work in October 2017. The ACT Government has publicly committed to delivering the scheme chosen by the jury and to introducing legislation to the ACT Legislative Assembly by the end of 2018. The aim is for the new scheme to commence in the second half of 2019. The new CTP scheme will have a significant impact on the CTP regulator's functions and systems, with additional requirements including, for example, a more extensive information role and some support for the dispute resolution mechanism. Peer- to-Peer car sharing Peer- to-peer car sharing (P2P car sharing) has been developing for a number of years as another element of the sharing economy. This form of car sharing generally involves offering cars that are owned by private owners or company fleets for short term rental. During 2016-17, Car Next Door (CND) which currently operates in Sydney and Melbourne, approached the ACT Government regarding setting up its operations in Canberra. CND focuses on offering privately owned cars for rent, from a few hours and up to one day, through a web-based platform. At the request of CND, during 2016-17, the CTP regulator facilitated a review by the insurers of the risks associated with a person being injured by a P2P car sharing vehicle. The review found that the risks for these services were substantially lower than for a commercial rental car, and consequently, a new CTP class 25B - Personal Share Vehicle (PSV) was created parallel to CTP class 25A - rideshare vehicle (given similar risks). On 13 July 2017 CTP subordinate legislation in the form of the Road Transport (Third-Party Insurance) Amendment Regulation 2017 (No 2) was notified to facilitate the new PSV arrangements. The CTP regulator wrote to insurers requesting PSV filings in July 2017, with the insurers providing filings in early to mid-August 2017. The PSV premiums were effective from 18 September 2017. CND has advised it expects to enter the ACT in the coming months. The CTP regulator has requested to be kept informed of the launch date to assist CND entering the market in terms of registration and CTP insurance. Other neighbourhood car sharing companies, such as Drive My Car and Popcar, are already operating in the ACT. Light Rail Vehicles During the course of 2016-17 and 2017-18, the CTP regulator assisted will amendments to the CTP Act to extend scheme coverage to include any personal injuries arising from a traffic accident involving a light rail vehicle (LRV). This allows persons with injuries arising from an LRV accident to be treated in a consistent manner with accidents involving other types of vehicles. Changes to the CTP Act became effective 11 October 2017. The CTP regulator requested all insurers to file premiums for the new CTP class 26 - LRV by 1 November 2017. New LRV premiums were effective 1 February 2018, and Canberra Metro paid for CTP coverage [and lifetime care and support (LTCS) levy] on 3 April 2018 to allow the first five LRVs to commence testing. Streamlining the CTP premium filing process Following work undertaken in 2016- 17, the CTP regulator continued to develop a 'streamlined' premium filing process with insurers during 2017-18. To respond to changes in the competitive landscape, including insurers filing smaller, more regular changes in premiums more often, parties worked together to implement revised Premium Guidelines. The key change was to revise section 6 of the Guidelines (which outlines the arrangements and data requirements for premium filings) to permit insurers to undertake a combination of full de novo and partial filings. Smaller, lower risk partial filings meeting various requirements (including premium changes within specified bands set by the scheme actuary) will no longer be subject to the detailed filing process. This will improve the efficiency of the filings process for both the insurers and the CTP regulator. The Guidelines also included enhanced data provision requirements for the insurers to allow the scheme actuary to undertake more detailed and comparable analysis of full de novo filings. The new Premium Guidelines were notified on 12 July 2018. The CTP regulator wrote to insurers on 13 July 2018 informing th em, based on the Scheme Actuary's advice, that the annual bands for the relevant partial flings commencing 1 February 2018 are premium: increases of up to 3% will not be considered excessive i.e. +0.5% (minimum threshold) to +3.0%; and reductions of up to 8% will be considered to provide full funding i.e. -0.5% (minimum threshold) to -8.0%. vehicle accident; greater efficiency and value for money; supporting people to better navigate the scheme and strengthening integrity of the scheme to reduce fraudulent behaviour.

Autonomous Vehicles In November 2016, the Transport and Infrastructure Council 2 approved work to start developing a regulatory framework to support the safe operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs), which included the following recommendation: \"Recommendation 7: That state and territory governments undertake a review of compulsory third-party and national injury insurance schemes to identify any eligibility barriers to accessing these schemes by occupants of an automated vehicle or those involved in a crash with an automated vehicle. That, subject to the review of insurance schemes, each state and territory government amends its compulsory third-party insurance schemes in close consultation with each other and industry, and that resulting reforms are nationally consistent wherever possible.\" To respond to Recommendation 7, a 'CTP Insurance Review' project (CTP review) has been put in place comprising representatives from the National Transport Commission (NTC) and Motor Accident Injury Insurance (MAII) schemes. The objectives of the CTP review are to: identify barriers to accessing compensation, under current MAII schemes, for personal injuries caused by an automated driving system (ADS); seek views on whether existing MAII schemes should be amended to provide cover for injuries caused by an ADS; and seek views on other options that could provide cover for injuries caused by an ADS. The work also considers, and links to other NTC projects [such as the Changing Driving Laws and Safety Assurance System (SAS) strategies], around establishing legal obligations for automated driving system entities (ADSEs). The CTP Review considers these legal obligations in the context of possibly including insurance options to address personal injury arising from accidents occurring because of defective AVs. During 2017-18 the CTP regulator provided advice and input into a discussion paper and participated in discussions as part of the MAII schemes and AV Working Group. A discussion paper on possible changes to MAII schemes to recognise AV driving functions and entities is currently in the process of being finalised. The NTC will then seek public feedback on options for providing insurance coverage for accidents involving an AV in the second half of 2018. During 2017-18 the CTP regulator also provided advice on a range of CTP and LTCS matters involving AVs, including more recently, the NTC projects - 'Changing Driving Laws to Support Automated Vehicles' and 'Proposed Criteria for the Statement of Compliance' (Part of the SAS for Autonomous Vehicles). 2 The Transport and Infrastructure Council, comprised of Commonwealth, state, territory and New Zealand Ministers, reports to the Council of Australian Governments, and plays a key role in delivering national reforms to improve the efficiency and productivity of Australia's infrastructure and transport systems. Road Safety initiatives In 2017-18 the CTP regulator contributed a further $50,000 to the Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) Safer Vehicle Choices road safety initiative, working in conjunction with both the Road Safety Policy unit in the Justice and Community Safety Directorate (JACSD) and ANCAP. The initiative largely builds on the successful 2016-17 ANCAP partnership campaign promoting safer vehicle choices which the CTP Regulator contributed to. The 2017-18 strategy again targets safer vehicles choices for young and older drivers, who statistically have a higher risk of being involved in an accident than other drivers, with these motorists encouraged to purchase the safest car (with the highest ANCAP star rating) they can afford. Evidence indicates that a person has 'twice the chance of being killed or seriously injured in a 3 star rated car c ompared to a 5 star rated car'. 3 The campaign is aimed at both reducing motor vehicle accidents and hence personal injuries, and also reducing the severity of the injuries sustained in such accidents. The campaign will be implemented through a multi-pronged strategy with the ANCAP crash vehicle display 4 occurring in universities and other Canberra locations; safer vehicle choices signage being displayed on Transport Canberra buses; and television advertisements running in the latter part of 2018. A growing number of accidents in the ACT occur where talking or texting on a mobile phone is undertaken while driving. As a result, in 2017-18 the CTP regulator also contributed $15,000 towards reactivating the road safety campaign targeting the dangers of driver distraction such as texting or talking on a hand-held mobile phone with advertisements on social media and bus backs running in the second half of 2018. The initiative aims to reiterate awareness of using phones and texting while driving and is aimed at reducing motor vehicle accidents and personal injuries as a result of such accidents. Other highlights The CTP regulator also: met with Heads of Motor Accident Injury Schemes (HMAIS) to discuss a range of national and strategic issues and to share information on issues facing individual CTP and LTCS schemes; met with the ACT CTP insurers, the ACT Nominal Defendant and the Insurance Council of Australia to share information and discuss a range of topical issues, with the aim of continually refining the operation of the CTP Insurance scheme; attended Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA) meetings with representatives from other privately underwritten CTP schemes to discuss regulatory and supervisory matters in respect to CTP insurers (following the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the CTP regulator and APRA in August 2017); and maintained the CTP website and responded to feedback from the public received by way of telephone calls through Access Canberra, via the CTP website at http://apps.treasury.act.gov.au/compulsorytpi/feedback , and general written correspondence. 3 ANCAP website - https://www.ancap.com.au/safety-ratings-explained . 4 The ANCAP display involved a 1998 and 2015 Corolla which were crashed head on at 64km/h, with the message: 'in the 2015 car you walk away, in the '98 model you're unlikely to survive'.

B.1.4 Market Share Market share indicates the proportion of the CTP market held by each insurer. It provides an indication of how the ACT community is responding to a competitive market. Figure 2 shows the average market share over each of the financial years from 2013-14 when competition began, through to the end of the latest financial year of 20 17-18. Market share is based on premiums collected by insurers. While Suncorp's brands (and in particular it's leading brand GIO) achieved significant gains in market share over the period 2013-14 to 2016-17, this share stabilised in 2017-18. Relative to the 2016-17 market share: GIO's market share was largely unchanged at 35.3% over the 2017 -18 financial year [a loss of 0.1 percentage point (pp) compared to 35.4% over the 2016-17 financial year]; NRMA's market share was also largely unchanged at 56.3% ov er the 2017-18 financial year (an increase of 0.3 pp compared to 56.0% over the 2016-17 financial year); and AAMI and APIA continue to hold relatively small market shares at 7.8% and 0.6% over the 2017-18 financial year respectively. Figure 2 - Movement in insurers' average m arket share since the introduction of competition B.1.5 Premiums and scheme affordability One of the objectives of the CTP Act is to keep the costs of insurance at an affordable level. The premiums charged by insurers reflect the bene fit structure underlying the ACT's CTP insurance scheme. The ACT's current scheme design differs from that of other State CTP schemes which tend to contain limits on benefits. For example, other CTP schemes limit access to common law and damages for non- economic loss (general damages and pain and suffering) to severe injuries - the current ACT scheme has no such restrictions. The ACT arrangements are reflected in the higher premiums motorists pay in the Territory and hence impact on the relative affordability of the scheme. The proposed new CTP scheme will in conjunction with introducing defined benefits for everyone, introduce thresholds and a general damages scale for common law claims and is currently anticipated to result in a reduction in premiums once it commences in the second half of 2019. As shown in Figure 3, affordability, measured as premiums as a proportion of ACT average weekly earnings (AWE) improved, falling by 5.3 percentage points over the period 2013-14 to 2017-18. This reflects average premiums falling as a proportion of AWE throughout this period. Affordability has improved despite slow wage growth. Figure 3 - Average Premiums for Private Passenger Vehicles and as a Proportion of ACT Average Weekly Earnings Notes: The average CTP premium is for a class 1 passenger vehicle based on a 12 month policy. B.1.6 Average cost of claims and claims frequency The average cost of a claim and claims frequency are important drivers of CTP insurance premiums. The higher the average cost per claim and claims frequency, the more funding insurers need to cover future claim payments and hence the need to set higher premiums. The average claim data provided in Figure 4 are based on both finalised and open claims - comprising reported claims, historical payments and case estimates, by accident year. 5 The inclusion of both finalised and open claims provides a complete picture of the scheme experience for accidents occurring in that year. While case estimates reflect the best estimate of the future cost of open claims, they will inevitably differ from the ultimate cost of the claim. Generally, where there is more information available on the claim, that is, they are more established claims for older accident years, case estimates are 5 Accident year means the year in which the accident occurred, not the year in which payments occur. B.1.4 Market Share Market share indicates the proportion of the CTP market held by each insurer. It provides an indication of how the ACT community is responding to a competitive market. Figure 2 shows the average market share over each of the financial years from 2013-14 when competition began, through to the end of the latest financial year of 20 17-18. Market share is based on premiums collected by insurers. While Suncorp's brands (and in particular it's leading brand GIO) achieved significant gains in market share over the period 2013-14 to 2016-17, this share stabilised in 2017-18. Relative to the 2016-17 market share: GIO's market share was largely unchanged at 35.3% over the 2017 -18 financial year [a loss of 0.1 percentage point (pp) compared to 35.4% over the 2016-17 financial year]; NRMA's market share was also largely unchanged at 56.3% ov er the 2017-18 financial year (an increase of 0.3 pp compared to 56.0% over the 2016-17 financial year); and AAMI and APIA continue to hold relatively small market shares at 7.8% and 0.6% over the 2017-18 financial year respectively.

Generally, where there is more information available on the claim, that is, they are more established claims for older accident years, case estimates are 5 Accident year means the year in which the accident occurred, not the year in which payments occur. considered to be better estimates of the ultimate cost. Because of this, to objectively reflect a reasonable picture of the average cost over time, the following figure provides data only up to 2014-15, as the data for the accident years of 2015-16 to 2017-18 are at this point in time too underdeveloped to reflect costs for these years with sufficient accuracy. 6 Figure 4 demonstrates that the average claims cost over the period 2008-09 to 2014-15 generally ranged from $100,000 to $120,000 with the exception of 2012-13, where the cost was just above $146,000. The average cost over the seven year accident period was $114,624. The average claim cost is driven by total claims costs (largely reflecting the overall severity of the accident injuries) and the number of claims. Figure 4 - Average claim cost, by accident year Notes: Payments make in earlier years have not been indexed to reflect 2014-15 values. The average cost per claim by accident year is based on both finalised and open claims comprising reported claims, historical payments and case estimates. Payments are gross amounts and claims numbers reflect only those claims for which payments have been made or are expected to be made. Accident years are on a financial accident year basis. Data for all years are subject to cha nge and reflect 'best case estimates' given all years comprise both finalised and open claims, with the open claims (and where applicable re-opened claims) containing varying proportions of case estimates. Further, the date only reflects actual claims made to date. Claims frequency (also known as the 'accident rate') is an important measure as it indicates the proportion of the Territory's motor vehicles that are involved in a motor vehicle accid ent and which make a CTP claim. It is calculated by dividing the number of CTP claims (by accident year) by the number of registered vehicles with a CTP policy. 6 Data for the 2015-16 accident year and beyond are deemed by the scheme actuary to be too underdeveloped to contribute to a reliable longitudinal analysis at this point in time, as the case estimates as a proportion of finalised and open claims (comprising both payments and estimates) is well over 50%. As shown in Figure 5, the number of claims and frequency of claims at a broad level move together. For the latest years, from 2015-16 to 2016-17: the number of claims fell by 4.7% to 910. This was higher than the average claims number over the 2009-10 to 2016-17 period of 804 (a); and claims frequency fell by 2.3 percentage points to 31.7 claims per 10,000 vehicles. This is below the average frequency of 33.7 for the 8 year period (a): claims frequency has remained within a fairly tight band over the 2009-10 to 2016-17 period, between a low of 31.5 and a high of 35.5 (that is, 32 to 36 in every 10,000 motor vehicles were involved in an accident that led to a CTP claim) (a). In 2016-17 the number of claims was higher than the average over the 2009-10 to 2016-17 period, while claims frequency in 2016-17 was lower than the average over the same period. This reflects the relationship between the trend in numbers of claims relative to the growth in the number of ACT registered vehicles with a CTP policy. Data for 2017-18 are not shown as they are not sufficiently developed at this point in time. Figure 5 - Number of claims and claims frequency, by accident year Notes: (a) Data from 2008-09 are excluded from this analysis given that the number of claims and claims frequency are understated. As the new CTP Act became effective 1 October 2008, claims data for 2008-09 reflects a part-year effect. Claims data are on an accident year basis (by financial year), that is, claims made during the year the accident occurred. In deriving claims frequency, the number of claims are divided by the number of ACT registered vehicles with a CTP policy (excludes trailers and non-engine caravans / campervans).considered to be better estimates of the ultimate cost. Because of this, to objectively reflect a reasonable picture of the average cost over time, the following figure provides data only up to 2014-15, as the data for the accident years of 2015-16 to 2017-18 are at this point in time too underdeveloped to reflect costs for these years with sufficient accuracy. 6 Figure 4 demonstrates that the average claims cost over the period 2008-09 to 2014-15 generally ranged from $100,000 to $120,000 with the exception of 2012-13, where the cost was just above $146,000.

As the new CTP Act became effective 1 October 2008, claims data for 2008-09 reflects a part-year effect. Claims data are on an accident year basis (by financial year), that is, claims made during the year the accident occurred. In deriving claims frequency, the number of claims are divided by the number of ACT registered vehicles with a CTP policy (excludes trailers and non-engine caravans / campervans). B.1.7 Claims payments Claim payments by heads of damage (HoD) is a useful measure for analysing where a scheme's funding is being spent and, importantly, the proportion of claims being paid directly to injured persons. To provide an objective view of HoD trends over the period 2008- 09 to 2013 -14, Figure 6 provides HoD payments as a proportion of total payments for those claims that have been finalis ed, on an accident year basis. The accuracy of the HoD percentages paid in each accident year is affected by the proportion of claims that have been finalised, with older accident years having a higher proportion of finalised claims. In this context, the time series provided excludes accident years from 2014-15 onwards as these years have relatively low proportions of finalised claims, and are therefore too incomplete at this point in time to be representative of the general trend in the various HoD. The data shows that over the period 2008- 09 to 2013 -14: general damages was t he largest component averaging 34% of total costs over the 6 year period (from a low of 32%, to a high of 38%); treatment and care costs averaged 23% of total costs, and had the highest variability over the period shown (from a low of 19%, to a high of 27% ); economic loss averaged 22% of total costs (from a low of 19%, to a high of 24%); and legal costs averaged 21% of total costs (from a low of 20%, to a high of 23%). Figure 6 - Heads of Damage as a proportion of total payments, by accident year Notes: Payments made in earlier years have not been indexed to reflect 2013 -14 values and are in relation to claims finalised. Payments are gross payments. Treatment and care costs comprise 'treatment costs' and 'past and future care costs'. legal costs', 'Investigation costs' Legal costs', but not solicitor -client fees. B.1.8 Fraud One of the objectives of the CTP Act is to establish and keep a register of motor accident claims to assist with the administration of the statutory insurance scheme and the detection of fraud. The electronic Personal Injury Register (PIR) is the database of all motor accidents that occur in the ACT. The CTP regulator is aware of cold calling and claims farming practices. There is evidence that these practices are continuing to occur in the ACT and other CTP schemes around Australia, and that the claims farming practices continue to evolve. The CTP regulator will continue to analyse the ACT's scheme data and work co -operatively with other Heads of MAII schemes and the ACT CTP insurers in regard to fraud issues and monitoring. B.1.9 Scheme Data The ACT's PIR system is the electronic register of all claims and payments relating to motor accidents involving personal injury in the ACT under the current CTP scheme. The data are collected from CTP insurers and the Nominal Defendant at regular intervals. The new CTP scheme (a hybrid no-fault common law scheme) has significant ramifications for the CTP regulator's data collection and reporting s ystems, with new data fields required to be collected. During 2017-18 CMTEDD progressed the business requirements; design; and project planning for implementing a new information technology system (ITS) which will reflect the new CTP scheme's configuration and capture the required reporting requirements, including defined benefits. In early 2018-19 it is expected that the project planning and associated requirements will be finalised, with the majority of the financial year dedicated to finalising the technical arrangements; liaising with stakeholders; building the business system; and testing the ITS in time for the commencement of the new scheme, expected in the second half of 2019. B.1.10 Profit Margins Section 46 of the CTP Act requires the CTP regulator to assess the profit margin included in the CTP premium and the actuarial basis on which the profit is calculated. The assessments must be reported on annually. All the insurers' profit margins were assessed a s being in a reasonable range. These profits are expected profits at the time premiums are filed. The range for the industry as assessed by the scheme actuary in 2017-18 was 8% to 11% (in 2016-17 the range was also 8% to 11%). B.1.11 Premium Determinations Section 38 of the CTP Act provides that insurers are only permitted to charge a premium approved by the regulator. The regulator usually receives a premium filing from licensed insurers at least annually. The regulator makes an assessment of each premium filing, based on expert independent actuaria l advice, and may approve a premium if it is assessed that it will fully fund the insurer's liabilities and is not considered to be excessive. If a premium filing is not received within a year, the regulator has to review and assess the existing premium in accordance with the same criteria. B.1.7 Claims payments Claim payments by heads of damage (HoD) is a useful measure for analysing where a scheme's funding is being spent and, importantly, the proportion of claims being paid directly to injured persons. To provide an objective view of HoD trends over the period 2008- 09 to 2013 -14, Figure 6 provides HoD payments as a proportion of total payments for those claims that have been finalis ed, on an accident year basis. The accuracy of the HoD percentages paid in each accident year is affected by the proportion of claims that have been finalised, with older accident years having a higher proportion of finalised claims. In this context, the time series provided excludes accident years from 2014-15 onwards as these years have relatively low proportions of finalised claims, and are therefore too incomplete at this point in time to be representative of the general trend in the various HoD. The data shows that over the period 2008- 09 to 2013 -14: general damages was t he largest component averaging 34% of total costs over the 6 year period (from a low of 32%, to a high of 38%); treatment and care costs averaged 23% of total costs, and had the highest variability over the period shown (from a low of 19%, to a high of 27% ); economic loss averaged 22% of total costs (from a low of 19%, to a high of 24%); and legal costs averaged 21% of total costs (from a low of 20%, to a high of 23%). Figure 6 - Heads of Damage as a proportion of total payments, by accident year Notes: Payments made in earlier years have not been indexed to reflect 2013 -14 values and are in relation to claims finalised. Payments are gross payments. Treatment and care costs comprise 'treatment costs' and 'past and future care costs'. legal costs', 'Investigation costs' Legal costs', but not solicitor -client fees. B.1.8 Fraud One of the objectives of the CTP Act is to establish and keep a register of motor accident claims to assist with the administration of the statutory insurance scheme and the detection of fraud.

The CTP regulator will continue to analyse the ACT's scheme data and work co -operatively with other Heads of MAII schemes and the ACT CTP insurers in regard to fraud issues and monitoring. B.1.9 Scheme Data The ACT's PIR system is the electronic register of all claims and payments relating to motor accidents involving personal injury in the ACT under the current CTP scheme. The data are collected from CTP insurers and the Nominal Defendant at regular intervals. The new CTP scheme (a hybrid no-fault common law scheme) has significant ramifications for the CTP regulator's data collection and reporting s ystems, with new data fields required to be collected. During 2017-18 CMTEDD progressed the business requirements; design; and project planning for implementing a new information technology system (ITS) which will reflect the new CTP scheme's configuration and capture the required reporting requirements, including defined benefits. In early 2018-19 it is expected that the project planning and associated requirements will be finalised, with the majority of the financial year dedicated to finalising the technical arrangements; liaising with stakeholders; building the business system; and testing the ITS in time for the commencement of the new scheme, expected in the second half of 2019. B.1.10 Profit Margins Section 46 of the CTP Act requires the CTP regulator to assess the profit margin included in the CTP premium and the actuarial basis on which the profit is calculated. The assessments must be reported on annually. All the insurers' profit margins were assessed a s being in a reasonable range. These profits are expected profits at the time premiums are filed. The range for the industry as assessed by the scheme actuary in 2017-18 was 8% to 11% (in 2016-17 the range was also 8% to 11%). B.1.11 Premium Determinations Section 38 of the CTP Act provides that insurers are only permitted to charge a premium approved by the regulator. The regulator usually receives a premium filing from licensed insurers at least annually. The regulator makes an assessment of each premium filing, based on expert independent actuaria l advice, and may approve a premium if it is assessed that it will fully fund the insurer's liabilities and is not considered to be excessive. If a premium filing is not received within a year, the regulator has to review and assess the existing premium in accordance with the same criteria. A premium filing assessment considers claims frequency, claim size, investment returns, administrative expenses, legal expenses and insurer profit - generally elements that serve to make up the overall cost of service for an insurer participating in the ACT CTP market. The role of the CTP scheme actuary is to provide expert actuarial advice to the CTP regulator. This role is currently performed by Finity Consulting Pty Limited, under contract. See B.2 Performance Analysis, performance indicator (a) for details on filings received during 2017- 18. B.1.12 Licensed Insurers Under section 184 of the CTP Act, the regulator may license an insurer to provide CTP insurance in the ACT. No applications from new insurers to become licensed insurers in the ACT were received during 2017- 18. B.1.13 Loadings on Short Term Premiums The following loadings apply to premiums on CTP policies with a duration of less than 12 months ('Short Term Premiums'): insurer's administration loading: $2.50; and insurer's lost investment income loading. The CTP Premium Guidelines require the CTP regulator to publish the insurer's lost investment income loading each year in the annual report. These loadings will be applied to short term premiums by the rego.act system in accordance with the formula in section 3.5.3 of the Premium Guidelines. The amount is determined by the scheme actuary and applies for the relevant financial year. The loading for the 2018-19 financial year is 0.187% per month (2017-18: 0.177%). B.1.14 CTP Average Annual Risk Premium The regulator is required to publish the average annual risk premium for CTP in the ACT. The risk premium represents the base risk amount that each insurer bears when providing CTP insurance in the ACT. Presently there are four licensed CTP insurers in the ACT. As such, the risk premium has been derived using a weighted average of data from all of the insurers and the Nominal Defendant in order to determine the average risk premium price per policy. The average risk premium price per policy for 2017-18 was $419.84 (2016-17: $422.73). B.1.15 Nominal Defendant The Nominal Defendant is liable for claims against uninsured or unidentified motor vehicles (including unregistered vehicle permits) for which a CTP insurer cannot be identified. Under section 13 of the CTP Act, the Australian Capital Territory Insurance Authority (ACTIA) is the Nominal Defendant. The Annual Report of the Nominal Defendant is annexed to ACTIA's Annual Rep ort. Section 3.5.2 of the CTP Premium Guidelines requires the Nominal Defendant loading (NDL) to be assessed on a yearly basis by the scheme actuary. The NDL that will 'apply to the next financial year' is to be published in the CTP regulator's annual repo rt. At the request of the CTP regulator, the scheme actuary has undertaken a review of the NDL for 2018-19. It has been determined that the NDL will increase to 4.7% in 2018-19 (the loading was increased to 4.5% in February 2018). The principal reason for the increase is due to the commercial insurers continuing to reduce premiums during 2017-18. As the NDL is a fixed percentage applied to the base CTP premium,7 reduced base premiums automatically result in a lower amount being transferred to the Nominal Defendant. This necessitates an increase in the NDL to maintain required funding. B.1.16 Outlook Priorities in 2018-19 and over the next three financial years relate to the objectives of the CTP Act and include: assisting CMTEDD to develop legislation to implement the new CTP scheme and an ICT solution for the increased data requirements. It is expected that the new scheme will commence in the second half of 2019; working with the National Transport Commission and other CTP regulators on identifying how CTP schemes deal with autonomous vehicles; working with peer- to-peer car sharing companies wanting to enter the ACT market; monitoring and reviewing the streamlined CTP premium filing process for specified (lower risk) filings to enhance the efficiency of the process for all impacted parties, while also encouraging more affordable premiums through ongoing competition; continuing to monitor the scheme's performance; and contributing to targeted road safety initiatives that assist in reducing motor accidents and personal injuries, and mitigating their impact. B.2 Performance Analysis The ACT CTP Insurance regulator's 2017 -18 performance indicators are included in the Statement of Intent, and are reported as part of the regulator's Statement of Performance. The 2017-18 financial year saw the CTP regulator develop and achieve the following indicators. Explanation of Performance Indicators a. ACTP Premiums are approved in accordance with the Road Transport (Third-Party Insurance) Act 2008 The CTP regulator is required to approve or reject a premium application under section 41 of the Road Transport (Compulsory Third-Party Insurance) Act 2008 (CTP Act). Under section 42, there are two grounds on which the CTP regulator is permitted to reject a premium filing: the premiums applied for by CTP insurers are too low (the fully funded test); or are too high (the excessive premium test). Premium filings were received from AAMI and APIA in June 2017 (approved in July 2017). Premium filings from all insurers for the new CTP Personal Share Vehicle class 25B were received in August 7 The base CTP premium is calculated as the CTP premium less GST and the Nominal Defendant Loading. A premium filing assessment considers claims frequency, claim size, investment returns, administrative expenses, legal expenses and insurer profit - generally elements that serve to make up the overall cost of service for an insurer participating in the ACT CTP market. The role of the CTP scheme actuary is to provide expert actuarial advice to the CTP regulator. This role is currently performed by Finity Consulting Pty Limited, under contract.

It is expected that the new scheme will commence in the second half of 2019; working with the National Transport Commission and other CTP regulators on identifying how CTP schemes deal with autonomous vehicles; working with peer- to-peer car sharing companies wanting to enter the ACT market; monitoring and reviewing the streamlined CTP premium filing process for specified (lower risk) filings to enhance the efficiency of the process for all impacted parties, while also encouraging more affordable premiums through ongoing competition; continuing to monitor the scheme's performance; and contributing to targeted road safety initiatives that assist in reducing motor accidents and personal injuries, and mitigating their impact. B.2 Performance Analysis The ACT CTP Insurance regulator's 2017 -18 performance indicators are included in the Statement of Intent, and are reported as part of the regulator's Statement of Performance. The 2017-18 financial year saw the CTP regulator develop and achieve the following indicators. Explanation of Performance Indicators a. ACTP Premiums are approved in accordance with the Road Transport (Third-Party Insurance) Act 2008 The CTP regulator is required to approve or reject a premium application under section 41 of the Road Transport (Compulsory Third-Party Insurance) Act 2008 (CTP Act). Under section 42, there are two grounds on which the CTP regulator is permitted to reject a premium filing: the premiums applied for by CTP insurers are too low (the fully funded test); or are too high (the excessive premium test). Premium filings were received from AAMI and APIA in June 2017 (approved in July 2017). Premium filings from all insurers for the new CTP Personal Share Vehicle class 25B were received in August 7 The base CTP premium is calculated as the CTP premium less GST and the Nominal Defendant Loading. 2017. Premiums for the new CTP Light Rail Vehicle (LRV) class 26, and to allow a common basis from which bands for streamlined partial premium fillings could be determined, were received from NRMA in October 2017 and AAMI, APIA, GIO in November 2017. All of the premium filings (and granted extensions) were assessed and approved in accordance with the Act. b. The scheme is fully funded All premium filings by licensed CTP insurers are reviewed by the scheme actuary to ensure they are fully funded. Review of the premium filings ensures that the scheme is able to pay out all presen t and future liabilities. Where an insurer does not make a premium submission during the financial year, the CTP regulator will request an independent actuarial review of the insurer's books to ensure that the ACT CTP Insurance scheme will continue to be fully funded. The scheme actuary considered that all insurers' premiums met the fully funded test in 2017 -18. c. Make guidelines under the Act The guidelines under the Act were discussed as a standing item at the 2017-18 ICA meetings. In addition, changes to the Premium Guidelines under the Act were drafted and discussed at the April 2018 ICA meeting, and progressed out of session with insurers during 2017-18. The instrumen t was notified on 12 July 2018. The key change was to revise section 6 of the Guidelines to permit insurers to undertake a combination of full de novo and partial filings. Smaller, lower risk partial filings meeting various requirements (including premium changes within specified bands set by the scheme actuary) will not be subject to the detailed filing process. This will improve the efficiency of the process for both the insurers and the CTP regulator. Enhanced data provision requirements from the insurers were also adopted to allow the scheme actuary to undertake more detailed and comparable analysis of full de novo filings. The Early Payment Guidelines were monitored and discussed during 2017-18, however, revisions were not necessary before 30 June 2018. No other guidelines have been implemented under the Act in 2017-18. d. To continue to refine the system of CTP insurance for vehicles in the ACT in conjunction with the insurers The CTP regulator and insurers met twice during 2017-18 at meetings facilitated by the ICA (there was also out- of-session correspondence with insurers on important issues). The meetings and correspondence included discussion of matters relating to improving the operation of the CTP scheme, namely: Informing insurers about the CTP Deliberative Democracy process (August 2017 meeting) and providing an outline of the citizens' jury outcomes and targeted consultation process during the legislative drafting for the jury's chosen model (April 2018 meeting); discussing changes to the Premium Guidelines to finalise streamlining provisions for relevant premium filings; discussing the CTP arrangem ents for the ACT's light rail vehicles; discussing the way motorists are informed about their 'current' CTP insurer on the registration renewal notices; seeking input into a draft response to NSW on proposed cross-border claims arrangements following implementation of a new NSW CTP scheme; and providing an update to insurers on the status of the entry of peer- to-peer car sharing organisations into the ACT market. e. Promote public awareness of the causes of motor accidents through funding measures| directed at reducing causes of motor vehicle accidents The CTP regulator contributed $65,000 in 2017-18 to various road safety strategies aimed at mitigating third-party motor vehicle injuries. This comprises: $50,000 for an Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) Safer Vehicle Choices campaign; and $15,000 for a Texting while Driving campaign. f. Complaints handling within 10 working days of receipt of the complaint In 2017-18, the CTP regulator achieved 100% compliance with this performance indicator in cases where no further information was required from another Directorate. B.3 Scrutiny During the reporting period the CTP regulator did not participate in any Legislative Assembly Committee inquiries related to its activities. There were no Ombudsman reports with recommendations in relation to the CTP regulator. The Auditor-General Report No.1 of 2018: ACT Government Strategic and Accountability Indicators made a number of recommendations that were relevant for the CTP regulator. In regard t o: Recommendation 3 (b), the CTP regulator has been requested to amend accountability indicators so they meet the criterion of Clarity; and Recommendation 4, all Territory entities, including the CTP regulator, have been requested to document their procedure for the review, selection and approval of strategic and accountability indicators. The amendment of accountability indicators [recommendation 3 (b)] and the documentation of procedures for the review, selection and approval of strategic and accountability indicators (recommendation 4) will be reviewed in line with updated guidance material once it has been released. B.4 Risk Management The CTP regulator has a risk management plan in accordance with the Australian/New Zealand risk management AS/NZS ISO 31000:2009 and the ACT Government's \"Enterprise Wi de Risk Management Framework\". The CTP regulator has overall responsibility for risk management, and for ensuring compliance with the risk management plan. The risk management plan identifies the key risk areas as operational, financial, legal and reputational risk. The risk management plan has identified the following potential risks: CTP regulator not meeting stakeholder expectations; 2017. Premiums for the new CTP Light Rail Vehicle (LRV) class 26, and to allow a common basis from which bands for streamlined partial premium fillings could be determined, were received from NRMA in October 2017 and AAMI, APIA, GIO in November 2017.

The CTP regulator has overall responsibility for risk management, and for ensuring compliance with the risk management plan. The risk management plan identifies the key risk areas as operational, financial, legal and reputational risk. The risk management plan has identified the following potential risks: CTP regulator not meeting stakeholder expectations; insufficient staff and/or resources available to achieve outcomes; failure to meet legislative requirements; and Personal Injury Register being unavailable on the ACT ICT platform. These risks are mitigated through the use of appropriate governance structures, application of risk based management strategies and financial reporting processes. B.5 Internal Audit The CTP regulator is part of the CMTEDD Audit and Risk Committee. CMTEDD's Annual Report section on Internal Audit Committee applies to the CTP regulator. No internal audits of the CTP regulator were undertaken during 2017-18. B.6 Fraud Prevention The functions of the CTP regulator are supported by the Financial Framework Management and Insurance (FFMI) Branch of the Economic and Financial Group (EFG), CMTEDD who adhere to the CMTEDD Fraud and Corruption Prevention Plan. B.7 Workplace Health and Safety The CTP regulator does not employ any personnel. The functions of the CTP regulator are supported by the FFMI Branch of EFG, CMTEDD who adhere to the Directorate's Workpla ce Health and Safety practices.

The CMTEDD's Annual Report section on HR management applies to the CTP regulator. B.9 Ecological Sustainable Development The CMTEDD's Annual Report section on Ecologically Sustainable Development applies to the CTP regulator. Financial Management Reporting C.1 Financial Management Analysis General Overview Objectives The role of the Australian Capital Territory Compulsory Third-Party Insurance regulator (CTP regulator) is to regulate the compulsory third-party (CTP) insurance scheme in the ACT under the CTP Act. The CTP regulator's functions are to be carried out in accordance with the objectives of the CTP Act under section 5A, which are to: continue and improve the system of CTP insurance, and the scheme of statutory insurance for uninsured and unidentified vehicles operating in the ACT; promote competition in setting premiums for CTP policies; keep the costs of insurance at an affordable level; provide for the licensing and supervision of insurers providing insurance under CTP insurance policies; encourage the timely resolution of personal injury claims resulting from motor accidents; promote and encourage, as far as practicable, the rehabilitation of people who sustain personal injury because of motor accidents; establish and keep a register of motor accident claims to help the administration of the statutory insurance scheme and the detection of fraud; and promote measures directed at eliminating or reducing causes of motor accidents and mitigating their results. In accordance with section 163C(1) of the CTP Act, the CTP regulator collects an amount for the Nominal Defendant Fund from each licensed CTP insurer in the Territory, as well as the Commonwealth and ACT Governments, that appropriately covers the claims against uninsured or unidentified motor vehicles for which the Nominal Defendant has responsibility. The amount collected by the CTP regulator is transferred to the Office of the Nominal Defendant. Under the CTP Act, the CTP regulator is required to maintain a current register of all claims lodged for personal injury following motor vehicle accidents occurring within the borders of the ACT. These claims are recorded on the ACT's Personal Injury Register (PIR). Risk Management The CTP regulator developed and implemented a risk management plan in accordance with the Australian/New Zealand risk management AS/NZS ISO 31000:2009 and the ACT Government's \"Enterprise Wide Risk Management Framework\". The CTP regulator has overall responsibility for risk management, and for ensuring compliance with the risk management plan. The key risks identified are financial, operational, legal and reputational. The key operational risk is related to whether the CTP regulator has sufficient resources, both in terms of financial and staffing capacity (including the number of staff as well as staff experience and expertise), to fulfil its obligations and operate effectively. The risks are mitigated through the use of appropriate governance structures, application of risk based management strategies and financial reporting processes. Financial Performance The following financial information is based on the audited Financial Statements for 2017-18 and 2016-17, and the forward estimates contained in the 2018-19 Budget Statements. Total Expenses 1.Components of Expenses For the financial year ended 30 June 2018, the CTP regulator recorded total expenses of $0.501 million. The largest component was administrative support expenses within supplies and insufficient staff and/or resources available to achieve outcomes; failure to meet legislative requirements; and Personal Injury Register being unavailable on the ACT ICT platform. These risks are mitigated through the use of appropriate governance structures, application of risk based management strategies and financial reporting processes.

Total Expenses 1.Components of Expenses For the financial year ended 30 June 2018, the CTP regulator recorded total expenses of $0.501 million. The largest component was administrative support expenses within supplies and services, which represents 43.3% of the total expenditure or $0.217 million. Administrative support expenses were associated with the reimbursement of salary and associated expenses for Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate (CMTEDD) staff to undertake the CTP regulator's functions. The CTP regulator did not employ any staff. Figure 1 ind icates the components of the CTP regulator's expenses for 2017 -18. Figure 1 - Components of Expenses 2. Comparison to Budget Total expenses of $0.501 million were $0.035 million, or 6.5% lower than the 2017-18 Budget of $0.536 million. The decrease mainly relates to lower than anticipated actuarial expenses. Budgeted actuarial expenses for an update and ad hoc work were not required during 2017-18. 3. Comparison to 2016-17 Actual Expenses Total expenses of $0.501 million were $0.1 million higher than the actual expenses of $0.401 million. The increase mainly relates to information technology costs ($0.061 million) and the amortisation of intangible assets ($0.032 million) associated with capital upgrades to the CTP scheme's Personal Injury Register information system. 4. Future Trends Expenses are budgeted to increase by $0.052 million (10.4%) in 2018-19 mainly due to: higher ICT costs associated with ongoing maintenance of the PIR system; and higher actuarial costs due to increased actuarial work on the 3 yearly section 275 review of the scheme. Expenses are expected to remain steady in 2019- 20. Total Income 1. Components of Income For the year ended 30 June 2018, the CTP regulator recorded a total income of $0.549 million. The CTP regulator's income was derived from the levy on ACT CTP vehicle registrations ($0.528 million) and interest from cash at bank ($0.021 million). Figure 2 indicates the components of the CTP regulator's income for 2017 -18. Figure 2 - Components of Income 2. Comparison to Budget Revenue for the year ended 30 June 2018 of $0.549 million was largely in line with the budget of $0.536 million. 3.

Future Trends Income in the forward years is relatively consistent with the 2017-18 income levels. Financial Position Total Assets 1. Components of Total Assets The total asset position at 30 June 2018 was $0.894 million and shows the CTP regulator held 70.4 % of its assets in cash. The intangible asset is the CTP scheme's Personal Injury Register information system. Figure 3 indicates the components of the CTP regulator's total assets as at 30 June 2018. Figure 3 - Total Assets at 30 June 2018 2. Comparison to Budget Total assets of $0.894 million at 30 June 2018 were $0.156 million or 21.1 % higher than the Budget of $0.738 million mainly due to higher levels of cash resulting from: lower than anticipated expense payments; and higher cash at bank at 1 July 2017 than anticipated at the time of the budget. 3. Comparison to 2016-17 Actuals Total assets at 30 June 2018 of $0.894 million were $0.105 million, or 13.3 % higher than the 30 June 2017 actual result of $0.789 million. The increase was mainly associated with a higher cash balance resulting from higher revenue received than the expenses. 4. Liquidity 'Liquidity' is the ability of the CTP regulator to satisfy its short -term debts as they fall due. A common indicator for liquidity is the current ratio, which compares the ability to fund short-term liabilities from short-term assets. A ratio of less than 1- to-1 may indicate a reliance on the next financial year's CTP regulator insurance levy to meet short-term debts. Table 1 indicates the liquidity position of the CTP regulator. Table 1 - Current Ratio Description At 30 June Prior Year Actual 2017 $'000 Current Year Budget 2018 $'000 Current Year Actual 2018 $'000 Forward Year Budget 2019 $'000s Forward Year Budget 2020 $'000s Forward Year Budget 2021 $'000s Forward Year Budget 2022 $'000s Current Assets 508 420 676 628 691 753 784 Current Liabilities 50 20 107 46 46 46 46 Current Ratio at 30 June 2018 was 6:1, which is more than sufficient to pay its liabilities as they fall due. The CTP regulator has budgeted to maintain a strong level of liquidity for future years. Total Liabilities 1. Components of Total Liabilities The CTP regulator's total liabilitie s of $0.107 million at 30 June 2018 relate to trade payables associated with the funding of road safety initiatives to mitigate third-party motor vehicle injuries, and accrued expenses associated with audit fees, actuarial expenses, and administrative support expenses. 2. Comparison to Budget Total liabilities of $0.107 million, at 30 June 2018 were $0.087 million higher than the Budget of $0.020 million. This was mainly due to higher than anticipated accrued expenses for road safety initiatives and actuarial services for work performed. 3. Comparison to 2016-17 Actuals The actual liabilities of $0.107 million at 30 June 2018 were $0.057 million higher than the 30 June 2017 actual amount of $0.050 million. In 2017-18, a large proportion of the payables relates to the funding of road safety initiatives. There were no outstanding initiative payments at 30 June 2017. C.3 Capital Works The CTP regulator did not undertake any Capital Works Projects in the 2017-18 financial year. C.4 Asset Management The CTP regulator has one intangible asset, in addition to its operational bank account. The intangible asset relates to software for the ACT Personal Injury Register and is amortised on a straight line basis over its useful life of 5 years.

Construction Occupations (Licensing) Act 2004 This annual report has been prepared according to Construction Occupations (Licensing) Act 2004 (the COLA). (s.112 Annual Report by Registrar) and Construction Occupations (Licensing) Regulation 2004 (s.44 Information in report to Minister). COLA Inspectorates The Construction Occupations Registrar utilises three key inspectorates to audit activities within the construction industry - the Construction Audit team, the Electrical Inspectorate and the Plumbing/Gasfitting Inspectorate. The teams focus on compliance of each of the licensed occupations within the construction industry, and the auditing and inspection of the works of licensees, specifically around the safety aspects of compliance of their work and installations. Responsibilities rely on effective carriage and operation under a range of construction industry laws including the Building Act 2004 , the COLA, the Electricity Safety Act 1971 , the Gas Safety Act 2000 , the Planning and Development Act 2007 (P&D Act), the Water and Sewerage Act 2000 , and the Dangerous Substances Act 2004 and various regulations and instruments. The Construction Audit team - conducts audits and site inspections of the work of building certifiers, builders and building assessors, predominantly within the housing and residential apartment sectors. The Electrical Inspectorate - conducts mandatory inspections on all new electrical installations in relation to electrical safety compliance with the Electricity Safety Act 1971 and all associated Australian Standards. The Plumbing and Gasfitting Inspectorate - inspects plumbing, drainage and gasfitting work undertaken by licensed plumbers, drainers and gasfitters. The inspectorate validates submissions for the installation of Type B gas appliances in domestic and commercial applications and also investigates complaints and undertakes disciplinary actions where necessary. Construction Audit The primary role of the Construction Audit Team is to protect the public/land owners by ensuring that licensed building surveyors, builders and building assessors (licensees) are meeting their legislative obligations. This is achieved by auditing work undertaken by licensees and utilising the engage, educate and enforce approach of Access Canberra in order to achieve compliance. The team also conducts audits on residential energy ratings issued by licensed building assessors on new building work and for sale and lease of residential premises. Performance There were 4,636 building approvals issued in the period 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2018.

Class C Builder Licensing Exam In 2017-2018 61 individuals undertook the Class C Builder licence examination. Results of the examination are identified in table 8 below. Table 8 Class C Builder Licence examinations Note: *Where there are two unsuccessful attempts the application is refused. The third and fourth attempts are from a new application being made by an individual that previously failed on their first application (1 and 2nd attempts at the examination). Responsive Compliance Building and Construction Complaints The Construction Occupations Registrar applies a risk-based compliance approach to ensure resources are targeted to where the risks of harm, unsafe practices or misconduct are the greatest, thereby strengthening the capacity to take action where the community, workers and the environment are most at risk. There are three strategic objectives central to the role of regulating the building and construction industry. Protection - through our actions we seek to protect the community from harm. We act to minimise risks to safety, health, sustainability and amenity and minimise financial loss from unlawful conduct; Prevention - we aim to limit and prevent harm, damage or economic loss by promoting compliance with the suite of construction legislation administered by the Construction Occupations Registrar; and Rectification - we may require people who have not complied with their obligations to rectify or remedy identified issues. Number Total Individuals that sat the examination 61 Number of applicants that passed on 1st attempt 31 Number of applicants that failed on 1st attempt 30 Number of applicants that passed on 2nd attempt 16 Number of applicants that failed on 2nd attempt 14 *Number of applicants that passed on 3rd attempt 1 *Number of applicants that failed on 3rd attempt 4 *Number of applicants that passed on 4th attempt 1 *Number of applicants that failed on 4th attempt 1 The aim is to achieve compliance by utilising the three fundamental steps of engage, educate and enforce. Compliance is encouraged through education but escalating enforcement actions are applied to those whose conduct will, or is likely to, cause harm, or those who demonstrate a disregard for the law. Engage means ensuring that there is a positive working relationship with stakeholders and members of the community. Educate means taking reasonable steps to ensure people know how to comply. We provide information to the industry and community to promote understanding and to encourage voluntary compliance. The Access Canberra website provides links to a number of publications and facts sheets which includes information relating to particular areas of the construction processes and legislative obligations. Enforce means taking action when non-compliance occurs proportional to the harm caused by the conduct. Like any regulatory regime, the optimal outcome is voluntary compliance. Education has a key role to play in maximising compliance by ensuring lack of information is not a contributing factor to non- compliance. During 2017 -18 Access Canberra received 546 complaints relating to building and construction. 289 complaints were resolved during the period. Some complaints related to multiple licensees under various occupations pertaining to individual building sites. The types of complaints received against specific occupations include allegations of: Builders: non-compliance with the National Construction Code; non-compliance with approved plans; no approved plans; no development approval ; and building quality - defective work . Building Surveyors: breach of planning laws; unlawful buildi ng unlawful building approval; breach of building code; refusal to lodge papers for certificate of occupancy and use; and improper association with bui lders. Electricians: poorly installed electrical installations; faulty wiring; and electrical complaints in general.

Disciplinary Actions A total of 133 demerit points were issued to construction occupations licensees in 2017- 2018. There were no referrals for occupational discipline to the ACAT. Advisory Boards Under Part 10 of the Construction Occupations (Licensing) Act 2004 , the registrar must establish an advisory board for a construction occupation. Three Boards are established, the Building Advisory Board, the Electrical Advisory Board and the Plumbing Advisory Board. They have the following functions: to provide advice about qualifications for the construction occupation if asked by the Minister; to help with investigations for the construction occupation if asked by the registrar; and to help develop and maintain information about emerging issues in the construction industry related to the construction occupation if asked by the registrar.

The Board's function and purpose are governed under section 6 and section 22A of the Act, as well as the Government Procurement Regulations 2007 . The Board must review and provide advice and, if appropriate, provide endorsement, to Territory entities on procurement proposals with an estimated value of $5 million or more, or $1 million or more for procurements that: are being undertaken by a Territory entity other than a public service directorate; involve the development or redesign of information and communications technology systems; or involve the disposal of assets. The Board's review of procurement proposals is key to ensuring that Territory entities pursue value for money as well as having regard for probity and ethical behaviour, management of risk, open and effective competition, and optimization of whole of life costs. It also ensures that the processes for major procurements comply with the Government's procurement framework, which includes legislation and policies available from the ACT Government Procurement website www.procurement.act. gov.au. The Board does not set policy; it provides support and advice to the ACT Government on the implementation of procurement policy. The Board is not responsible for procurement decisions. This responsibility rests with Directors-General, Executive Directors or the relevant Chief Executive Officer (CEO), who are responsible for the operations of their directorates, and the heads of other relevant entities. Internal Accountability Membership of the Board Section 11 of the Government Procurement Act stipulates the Board comprises nine part- time members: Chair, who is a public employee member; Deputy Chair, who is a public employee member; three other public employee members; and four non- public employee members. The Acting Chair of the Board at 30 June 2018 was Ms Meredith Whitten, Deputy Director General, Workforce Capability and Governance, Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate. The position of Chair, like all Board memberships, is part-time, appointed by the Treasurer (the Minister) under the Government Procurement Act. The Chair reports directly to the Minister in relation to her role on the Board. The ACT Government has a policy of achieving and maintaining 50% representation of women on its boards and committees. The Office for Women (Community Services Directorate) is consulted each time a Board vacancy is filled. The Office of Disability and the Office for Multicultural Affairs are also consulted each time a Board vacancy is filled.

The Board has instituted the following arrangements: members are aware and support the Board's Charter and have signed a Code of Conduct agreement; members are requested to identify whether they have a potential conflict of interest in respect of a proposal or policy matter prior to the related documents being considered. Members with a conflict of interest in a matter are not involved in the discussion or endorsement relating to that matter; and prior to the commencement of all meetings, members are also invited to state any conflict of interest that may arise due to the business to be considered at the meeting. The minutes of the meeting reflect the identification of any potential conflict(s) of interest and any action taken by the Board in respect of any conflict(s).

This includes checking the consistency of statement s of performance with those statements previously reviewed (where a statement of performance is required by legislation). Organisational Overview and Performance B.1 Organisation Overview The Workers Compensation Act 1951 (the Workers Compensation Act) was established to provide compensation to workers employed in the private sector for injuries arising out of or in the course of their employment. The Default Insurance Fund (the Fund) was established under the Workers Compensation Act effective 1 July 20 06. It provides a safety net mechanism to meet the cost of workers' compensation claims made by workers in circumstances where: an employer does not have a workers' compensation insurance policy and cannot meet the claim costs payable under the Workers Compensation Act; or an employer's insurance company is wound up under the Corporations Act or cannot provide the indemnity required to be provided under a compulsory workers' compensation policy; or a worker is suffering from an imminently fatal asbestos-related disease as a result of exposure to asbestos fibres whilst employed as a worker in the Australian Capital Territory.

This includes checking the consistency of statement s of performance with those statements previously reviewed (where a statement of performance is required by legislation). Organisational Overview and Performance B.1 Organisation Overview The Workers Compensation Act 1951 (the Workers Compensation Act) was established to provide compensation to workers employed in the private sector for injuries arising out of or in the course of their employment. The Default Insurance Fund (the Fund) was established under the Workers Compensation Act effective 1 July 20 06. It provides a safety net mechanism to meet the cost of workers' compensation claims made by workers in circumstances where: an employer does not have a workers' compensation insurance policy and cannot meet the claim costs payable under the Workers Compensation Act; or an employer's insurance company is wound up under the Corporations Act or cannot provide the indemnity required to be provided under a compulsory workers' compensation policy; or a worker is suffering from an imminently fatal asbestos-related disease as a result of exposure to asbestos fibres whilst employed as a worker in the Australian Capital Territory. Funds are held in trust under the Financial Management Act 1996 in two separate accounts: the Uninsured Employer Fund (UEF); and the Collapsed Insurer Fund (CIF). Functions The Fund meets the cost of any awards and claims for workers' compensation, including the payment of weekly compensation, rehabilitation costs and medical expenses, as well as compensation settlements and any common law judgments or settlements. A public servant is appointed by the Director-General, Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate, to manage the Fund. Mr. John Fletcher, General Manager, ACT Insurance Authority, is the current Fund Manager. Administrative operations are subject to the same governance controls in relation to risk management, fraud prevention and records management as the ACT Insurance Authority (the Authority). The Authority's reporting on these operations is included in the relevant sections of the ACT Insurance Authority Annual Report. Internal Accountability The Default Insurance Fund Advisory Committee is established under Schedule 3 of the Workers Compensation Act. Their role is to monitor the operations of the Fund and, if requested by the Minister or the Fund Manager, advise on matters relating to the operation of the Workers Compensation Act. The Committee comprises the Executive Director, Continuous Improvement and Workers' Compensation (Chair), the Fund Manager and three members appointed by the Minister. The membership of the Fund Advisory Committee is: Michael Young - Executive Director, Continuous Improvement & Workers' Compensation (Chair); Graciete Ferreira - Master Builders Association ACT (Employer Representative); Susie Walford - GIO Insurance (Insurer Representative); Rosalind Read - Construction Forestry Maritime Mining and Energy Union ACT (CFM EU) (Employee Representative); and John Fletcher - Fund Manager. The Committee met on four occasions during 2017-18. At each meeting, a report on the status of the Fund was provided and a schedule detailing the status of all open claims was considered. B.2 Performance Analysis Uninsured Employer Fund (UEF) This component of the Fund currently administers claims which have arisen when a worker has been injured and the employer failed to hold an ACT Workers' Compensation Policy. Where the employer does not or cannot meet the cost of claims, the UEF responds on behalf of the employer as the default insurer. Claims When a claim is received the UEF undertakes an insurer search in an attempt to locate an insurer for the injured worker. In some cases an insurer is identified and the claim is then forwarded to the appropriate insurer. When satisfied that an insurance policy is not in place, the Fund acts as the default insurer for the injured worker. The Fund arranges and facilitates appropriate rehabilitation and medical treatment for injured workers with the aim of returning an injured worker back to their pre- injury state where possible. Claims are managed within the auspices of the Act, and the Fund meets the cost of all legislated entitlements for injured workers including weekly compensation, medical expenses, rehabilitation costs, and lump sum settlements. Table 1: Uninsured Employer Fund Claims Uninsured Employer Fund - Claims Total claims opened during the reporting period 11 Total claims closed during the reporting period 13 Current open claims 31 Revenue The Workers Compensation Act, Section 168A requires the Fund Manager to undertake a review of the Uninsured Employer Fund each year to determine the appropriate levy on workers compensation insurers. In considering an appropriate levy for 2017 -18, the Fund Manager took into consideration a range of issues including a sensitivity analysis of the volatility of the Fund, the potential for an increase in claims costs, claim numbers in the current and future insurance years and any changes to Wo rkers' Compensation legislation. On 1 July 2017, the Workers' Compensation Amendment Act 2016 (No 2) was introduced. This amendment included providing benefits to workers in relation to claims for imminently fatal asbestos-related disease (IFARD) through the UEF. The Fund Manager imposed contributions from insurers and self-insurers equal to 2.9 % of the gross written premiums for 2017-18, an increase from the 2016- 17 rate of 1.4% . For the reporting period 2017-18, a total of $28.252 million of levy revenue has been recorded on the operating statement. This revenue comprises $5.849 million in levy revenue invoiced to licensed insurers and self-insurers and an amount of $22.403 million that establishes a receivable on the balance sheet to meet the cost of fut ure claims payable at the commencement of the IFRAD scheme. Expenses The total expenses for 2017 -18 were $32.294 million. Balance Sheet As at 30 June 2018, t he Fund holds total assets of $39.271 million consisting of $14.441 million in cash and cash equiva lents and current receivables of $ 1.668 million along with non-current receivables of $23.162 million and total liabilities of $39.271 million predominately consisting of $39.164 million in provision for claims payable. Collapsed Insurer Fund (CIF) This component of the Fund currently administers claims which have arisen from a previously approved Workers' Compensation Insurer that has been wound up or is under liquidation. Currently the Fund administers claims for two collapsed insurers, National Employers ' Mutual Association Ltd in 1990 (NEM) and HIH Insurance in 2001 (HIH). Administrative operations are subject to the same governance controls in relation to risk management, fraud prevention and records management as the ACT Insurance Authority (the Authority).

The Council has a particular role in advising the Director on the disposal of ACT Government records. The retention and disposal of records is authorised through Records Disposal Schedules, issued under section 19 of the Territory Records Act. All draft schedules are referred to the Council for advice before th ey are approved by the Director. During 2017 -18 the Council considered four new or revised Records Disposal Schedules. This is a reduction on the total of 22 schedules for 2016- 17, when the Territory Records Office conducted a large scale review of its Com mon Functions Thesaurus and associated disposal schedules. The Council has maintained its interest in the Territory Records Office's work to influence digital recordkeeping practices in the ACT Public Service. Members noted in particular the Director's ro le in the consideration of information technology-supported budget initiatives through her membership of the Chief Digital Officer's Digital Services Governance Committee. The Council also endorses the Office's ongoing work to assist agencies to transition their recordkeeping to a WoG , digital environment. The Office's commissioning of a configuration review of the WoG electronic document and records management system (EDRMS) is, in Council's view, important in maintaining and improving the usability of the system and its acceptance by ACT Government business units. Council also takes seriously its role in advising on issues relating to publicly accessible records. Members no ted that the Find of the Month and the Chief Minister's Governance Lecture continue to be important initiatives for the Office and play a key role in demonstrating the richness of the ACT Government's archives to a wider audience. Council members also rece ived reports on the Office's role in developing guidelines and systems to support the introduction of the Open Access Information Scheme under the Freedom of Information Act 2016 , which came into effect on 1 January 2018. Members saw a demonstration of th e Open Access Information website, and were able to provide valuable feedback to the Office on its operation. The Council meeting agenda also includes a standing item on decisions to restrict archives from public access under section 28 of the Act. There were no requests from agencies for section 28 declarations during 2017- 18. The 2017 -18 budget included funding for the ACT Heritage Library to move to larger premises at Fyshwick, and the ArchivesACT service will be part of this move. The Council notes with interest the continuing work to support closer cooperation between the two institutions when they move to the new environment. Council members particularly look forward to the opportunities the new accommodation will present for ArchivesACT to store some archival material on site, and note that a dedicated archives repository would further enhance the security, preservation and public accessibility of the ACT's most significant government archives. Council members were keenly interested in the restructure of the Territory Records Office, which occurred during 2017-18. Members noted that the new structure would provide greater leadership depth to the Office, and allow the Director of Territory Records to engage more strategically with ACT Government and oth er stakeholders. The Chair of the Council was involved in the selection process for the new Director's position, and members congratulated Ms Danielle Wickman on her appointment to the role. Performance Overview and Highlights for 2017 -2018 During the 201 7-18 reporting year the Territory Records Office has undergone considerable change to better position it to drive digital approaches to ACT Government archives and records management. The Office continues to pursue a range of initiatives that are intended to make better use of digital technology in support of efficient and effective management across government of authoritative records that contribute to good government, customer service, accountability and community interests. A restructure of the Office h as been completed to provide greater strategic depth and to support the Director's increased engagement with a range of stakeholders across government and externally. The new structure created a new position of Deputy Director of Territory Records, and inc reases the ongoing staffing of the Office from 5.4 to 6.4 FTE staff. During 2017- 18 the Office's staffing also functions under the Territory Records Act, including approving standards for government recordkeeping, authorising the disposal of Territory records, and making determinations regarding the restriction of records from public access. Territory Records Advisory Council The Territory Records Advisory Council is established by the Territory Records Act, and advises the Director on a range of records management issues, particularly in relation to access to and disposal of records, and on the protection of records about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage. Members of the Council are appointed on a parttime basis by the Minister, and appointments must be made from the range of categories set out in section 44 of the Territory Records Act. The Director of Territory Records is also a member of the Council. Members, apart from the Director, are appo inted for a term of three years and may be reappointed. Members are paid a sitting fee in accordance with the ACT Remuneration Tribunal's Determination 8 of 2018 - Part Time Public Office Holder - Territory Records Advisory Council. The activities of the Council are funded from within the Territory Records Office's budget, and financial oversight, including risk management, audit and fraud control arrangements, are managed within the Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate's control systems. No specific code of conduct has been established for Territory Records Advisory Council members, but members are required to sign a conflict of interest declaration as part of the appointment process. The Council has not established any sub committees. The Territory Records Advisory Council met four times during 2017 -18. Membership of th e Council during the year and the number of meetings each member attended is as follows: Name Role Meetings attended Mr Michael Piggott (Chair) Records management and archives 4/4 Ms Liesl Centenera (Deputy Chair) Public administration, governance, public accountability 4/4 Mr David Brumby Records management and archives 4/4 Ms Narelle Rivers Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage 3/4 Mr Geoffrey Rutledge ACT Government agencies 2/4 Mr Nick Swain History and heritage 3/4 Dr Martin Thomas History and heritage 4/4 Mr Keith Young Public administration, governance, public accountability 3/4 Ms Danielle Wickman Director of Territory Records 4/4 The Council receives regular reports on public access, relations with government agencies and progress against the Territory Records Office's business plan.

The new structure created a new position of Deputy Director of Territory Records, and inc reases the ongoing staffing of the Office from 5.4 to 6.4 FTE staff. During 2017- 18 the Office's staffing also included an additional officer, funded with assistance from ACT Government Directorates, to support the implementation of the Freedom of Information Open Access scheme. The core of the Office's work remains unchanged. We continue to deliver a number of recordkeeping policy, regulatory and advice products and services to ACT Government agencies and the community, including: sponsoring a community of practice amongst ACT Government agency records and information management practitioners; assisting agencies to respond to requests from, and the report of, the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse; managing copyright licensing arrangements and developing policy approaches on behalf of agencies; authorising schedules for the disposal of Territory records, and monitoring their implementation by agencies; updating and extending our advice to agencies on records management issues; providing a friendly, effective and timely service to members of the public accessing ACT Government archives; and pursuing opportunities to promote the archival resources of the ACT. Digital Record Keeping Trustworthy and reliable digital recordkeeping systems are essential to support all aspects of the work of the ACT Government, and in particular the transition of ACTPS offices to activity based working and the delivery of the Chief Digital Officer's ACT Government Digital Strategy 2016- 2019 . Following the successful completion of the WoG digital recordkeeping project in October 2016, the Office has concentrated on building the case for the further deployment of digital records capabilities for the ACTPS. In conjunction with Shared Services, the Office was successful in securing funding in the 2018- 19 budget. The Office's initiative, which will commence in the 2019 calendar year, will work in close collaboration with Shared Services to extend the rollout of EDRMS capabilities to up to 8,500 staff over four years. Territory Records Office staff worked extensively with Shared Services to develop a deployment and funding model that would meet WoG needs and provide appropriate incentives for agencies to join the EDRMS service. Development of the business case also involved discussions with the ACT Government's Flexible Work Arrangements team, to ensure that the Office's plans are capable of supporting the ACT Government's transition to activity based working arrangements in the new Government offic e accommodation. In the lead-up to the new EDRMS initiative, the Territory Records Office has commissioned a review of the existing configuration of the WoG EDRMS established through the 2016 pilot project. The review is intended to test some of the decisions made about the way users are required to manage their records in the system. The review has made recommendations about adjustments that can improve users' experience and acceptance of the system and to respond to particular business needs. The review was completed in late June 2018, and the Office will work in conjunction with Shared Services to implement its findings in 2018- 19. Recordkeeping Tools and Guidance During the year the Territory Records Office continued its introduction of the Better Records Advice and Support Service. BRASS undertakes detailed, targeted analysis of agency recordkeeping practices and makes recommendations for better practice. Following the completion of two 'test' engagements with agencies, the Office is considering the lessons learned from this process before embarking on a full program for 2018-19. That program is expected to look in particular at agency processes for authorising the disposal of records, and approaches to considering recordkeeping requirements in the dev elopment of business systems. Following our 2016 -17 review of our WoG Thesaurus, the Office has pursued a project to upgrade and make better use of the specialist software supporting the Thesaurus. An important interim step has been to improve the integration of the T hesaurus software with key systems used by Shared Services in the creation and management of hard copy records, where these are still required by agencies. That project has required significant engagement with the software vendor and Shared Services, and will lay the foundation for further improvements to the way the Territory Records Office manages the legislative instruments that authorise the disposal of ACT Government records in all formats. Chief Minister's Governance Lecture The Chief Minister's Governance Lecture provides the opportunity for a researcher of some standing to explore a topic relevant to the history of the administration of the ACT, through the use of newly released archival records. The aim of the lecture is to encourage substantial use of the Territory's archives and to share the results of that research with the broader community through a public event. On 8 February 2018 the Office presented its third Lecture. The Lecture is an opportunity to highlight the rich resources that can be found in ACT Government archives, and their links with the debates in our city today. This year's lecturer was Dr Michael Easson, AM, chairman of the ACT Government's City Renewal Authority. Dr Easson has qualifications on history, transport and urban planning, politics, finance, management and sustainable development, and this unique range of experiences enabled him to deliver a thoughtful and eng aging lecture titled \"All Aboard: The Journey of High Speed Rail to Canberra\". The audience for the Lecture has increased with each event, with around 80 people attending the third Lecture. The Lecture is an avenue through which the Territory Records Offi ce seeks to reach groups and individual who may not otherwise be users of government archives, encouraging new understandings of our city's history and its relevance today. Open Access Information Scheme The Freedom of Information Act 2016 introduced a new proactive publication regime, known as the Open Access Information scheme, which came into effect on 1 January 2018. Open Access Information requires ACT Government agencies to proactively publish a range of documents. It is intended to underpin open government principles and reduce the need for individuals to use detailed Freedom of Information application processes to access government information. The Scheme relates primarily to agency policy documents, but also requires (subject to a public interest test) publication of Ministers' diaries, summaries of Cabinet decisions and information about ACT Government boards and committees. The Territory Records Office worked closely with staff in the Justice and Community Safety Directorate and in Shared Services Online Services to support the introduction of the new requirements. This included development of guidelines and fact sheets on the application of the included an additional officer, funded with assistance from ACT Government Directorates, to support the implementation of the Freedom of Information Open Access scheme. The core of the Office's work remains unchanged. We continue to deliver a number of recordkeeping policy, regulatory and advice products and services to ACT Government agencies and the community, including: sponsoring a community of practice amongst ACT Government agency records and information management practitioners; assisting agencies to respond to requests from, and the report of, the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse; managing copyright licensing arrangements and developing policy approaches on behalf of agencies; authorising schedules for the disposal of Territory records, and monitoring their implementation by agencies; updating and extending our advice to agencies on records management issues; providing a friendly, effective and timely service to members of the public accessing ACT Government archives; and pursuing opportunities to promote the archival resources of the ACT.

The Territory Records Office worked closely with staff in the Justice and Community Safety Directorate and in Shared Services Online Services to support the introduction of the new requirements. This included development of guidelines and fact sheets on the application of the Scheme, and designing and overseeing the development of the Open Access Information web page. As at 30 June there were more than 3,500 documents publicly available through the site at http://www.act.gov.au/open-access , which had received more than 7,000 visits. Public Access to Territory Archives ArchivesACT, a unit of the Territory Records Office, provides access to ACT Government archives for members of the public on behalf of agencies, and promotes archival materials to the community more broadly. Alongside the Chief Minister's Governance Lecture, our Fin d of the Month continues to be our key avenue to bring the stories in the ACT Government archives to a wide audience. Each month, ArchivesACT staff identify and share with the community some of the interesting and sometimes quirky items to be found in the archives. In 2017 -18 we brought to life Government archives about travelling stock routes in the ACT, the building of Belconnen Mall, and corporal punishment in Canberra schools. The ACT Heritage Library continues to be a partner in the work of ArchivesACT. Our two institutions are currently co-located at Woden Library, and we share a core customer group of dedicated researchers who make good use of both services. While we each have different missions and functions, we are increasingly working together to p rovide public access to the ACT's documentary heritage. Planning for our foreshadowed move to new joint premises at Fyshwick continues, and ArchivesACT staff have been researching the approaches taken in other jurisdictions to the colocation and harmonisation of public archives and library services. We also jointly marked the Canberra and Region Heritage Festival by producing a postcard that celebrates the work of Charles Weston, who is credited with establishing Canberra as the \"garden city\". Another joint project with the Library, our shared ACT Memory database, also continued during the year. While we had hoped to publicly launch the database during 2017-18, work has been delayed due to staff movements in both ArchivesACT and the Heritage Library. Development work on the database will continue into 2018-19. When finalised, ACT Memory will make information about publicly available ACT Government archives more accessible, and will allow researchers to, for the first time, conduct their own searches for these materials. The system will use open source, cloud-hosted software developed with the sponsorship of the International Council on Archives, called Access to Memory, or AtoM. Outlook The 2018 -19 financial year will be a significant one for the Territory Records Office. Budget funding for the continuing implementation of digital records systems and preparations for agencies to transition to activity based working will see the Office's FTE staffing increase to a peak of 11.4 during the delivery of the initiative. Beginning in 2019, the Office will commence a project to develop the long-term strategy for digital recordkeeping, including by implementing our response to our EDRMS configuration review and identifying opportunities for better integration of the AC T's digital recordkeeping systems into business processes. Also in 2019, the Office will establish a team to advise agencies on the proper management of their existing paper records as they prepare to move into new Government office accommodation and transition to activity based working. The Office will also begin to take advantage of its new core structure to increase its engagement at senior levels across the ACT administration and complete its significant business improvement projects. Key areas of focus will be the transition of support for the Open Access Information Scheme to business as usual operations, the continued rollout of the BRASS initiative, the ongoing development of ACT Memory, and the move of our public reading room to Fyshwick. Whole of G overnment Reporting on Territory Records The ACT Government's Annual Report Directions require information about agency records management arrangements to be consolidated in the Director of Territory Records' Annual Report. The reporting requirements and a gencies' responses are set out below. Directorates and public sector bodies must provide a statement that indicates whether: a current Records Management Program has been approved by the directorate/public sector body's Principal Officer and submitted to the Director of Territory Records; Records Management Procedures have been created and implemented throughout the directorate/public sector body; and appropriate training and resources are made available to all staff in the directorate/public sector body.

Records Disposal Schedules Records disposal schedules are issued under section 19 of the Territory Records Act to identify the records that must be retained by ACT Government agencies as Territory archives, and which others may be destroyed when they no longer have significant value to the agency, the government or the community. A core group of records disposal schedules covers functions commonly undertaken by all government agencies. In addition, agencies must have in place records disposal schedules that are relevant to their specific business functions. Agencies cannot destroy a Territory government record unless a relevant records disposal schedule has been issued and that schedule has been identified in the agency's records manag ement program.

A focus has been placed on the sentencing and disposal requirements of hardcopy records across the directorate. Cultural Facilities Corporation The CFC has continued the rollout to digitise our records where possible using the WIRE interface/WoG Records Manager. Records Services have provided staff with support and training. Independent Competition and Regulatory Commission The Commission completed an audit of all registry files on site and in offsite storage and completed a destruction process approved by the Territory Records Office. The Commission is currently in discussion with Record Services regarding the implementation of an EDRMS. Community Services Directorate Record disposal schedules and functional thesauri continue to be reviewed, developed and implemented to ensure consistency and uniformity with the management and control of the directorate records. As part of the d irectorate's records management continuous improvement program, a review of onsite record holdings via a file census was undertaken throughout the directorate. In 2017-18, this included Child and Youth Protection Services and Out of Home Care Agency files. The d irectorate's ongoing records disposal program to sentence and dispose of time expired records is to not only ensure efficiencies in records management but also to reduce storage costs. Environment Planning and Sustainable Development Directorate EPSDD is currently undertaking activity in preparation for a move to activity based work in new ACT Government accommodation scheduled for completion in 2020. EPSDD is assisting with the re-allocation of records across the directorate, the Suburban Land Agency and City Renewal Authority following the commencement of the Administrative Arrangements 2017 (No 1) . Health Directorate Clinical Records In 2017-2018 ACT Health continued to fund the strategy to maintain the reduced clinical record scanning delay and clinical coding backlog by continuing to invest in temporary scanning staff and contract coders. The clinical record scanning delay has been maintained at less than 2 weeks and the additional scanning staff are expected to be required until the new, more efficient Clinical Patient Folder (CPF) scanning solution can be implemented in 2018-2019. The Clinical Coding backlog has also been maintained at less than 3,000 records by supplementing the in-house coding team with contract coders when required. The reduction in the scanning delay facilitates high quality patient care and timely clinical coding while the reduction in the clinical coding backlog supports compliance with mandatory data submission timeframes and accurate data for activity monitoring and management of the health service. ACT Health has a project underway to replace CRIS, the current clinical record scanning solution with the new CPF - Clinical Patient Folder application in 2018-2019. The new clinical record information system will provide increased efficiency around the digitisation of clinical records and improved usability for clinicians. The highly intuitive user interface and sophisticated e-forms functionality will enhance patient care by facilitating ready access by clinicians to critical health information and clinical record documents.

Legislative Framework and Functions The Environment Protection Authority (the Authority) is a statutory public servant position established by the Environment Protection Act 1997 (the Environment Protection Act). It is currently assigned to the Deputy Director Environment Protection within Access Canberra. The Authority is supported by the Environment Protection Business Unit (also referred to as the EPA) within Access Canberra, to carry out its functions. The EPA administers the follow legislation: Environment Protection Act 1997 (the Environment Protection Act); Environment Protection Regulation 2005 (the Environment Protection Regulations); Water Resources Act 2007 (the Water Resources Act); Water Resource Regulation 2007 (the Water Resource Regulations); Clinical Waste Act 1990 (the Clinical Waste Act) ; and Lakes Act 1970 (the Lakes Act). Environment Protection Act 1997 The Authority oversees the administration of the Environment Protection Act . The Environment Protection Act provides for the protection of the environment and for related purposes. The objectives of the Environment Protection Act include to: protect and enhance the quality of the environment; prevent environmental degradation and risk of harm to human health; achieve effective integration of environmental, economic and social consideration in decision-making processes; establish a single and integrated regulatory framework for environmental protection and provide for monitoring and reporting of environmental quality on a regular basis; The EPA is the primary environmental regulator for the ACT. Our Mission is to protect and enhance the well-being of the environment and community as the ACT's primary environmental regulator. Our Vision is a sustainable environment for future generations. facilitate the implementation of national environment protection measures and laws; ensure contaminated land is managed having regard to human health and the environment; and encourage responsibility by the whole community for the environment - general environmental duty of care. Water Resources Act 2007 The Water Resources Act provides for sustainable management of the water resources of the Territory, and for other purposes. The objects of the Water Resources Act are to: ensure that management and use of the water resources of the Territory sustain the physical, economic and social wellbeing of the people of the ACT while protecting the ecosystems that depend on those resources; protect aquatic ecosystems and aquifers from damage and, where practicable, to reverse damage that has already happened; and ensure that the water res ources are able to meet the reasonably foreseeable needs of future generations. Clinical Waste Act 1990 The Authority is the Clinical Waste Controller under the Clinical Waste Act. The Clinical Waste Act provides for the transport, treatment and disposal of wastes resulting from the treatment and care of people and animals, including such things as needles, fluids and specimens. Lakes Act 1970 The Deputy-Director Environment Protection is the delegate of the Lakes Act. This is a ministerial delegation and provides delegations for approving structures and activities (such as motorised boat activities) on designated lakes and waterways in the ACT. The delegation also includes powers for closing lakes in the event of a threat to human health or the environment, for example, pollution or emergency incidents, discharges, special events, blue green algae outbreak. Environment Protection Policy The Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development Directorate are responsible for the environmental legislation and for developing policy and guidelines to facilitate its implementation. These policies and guidelines help clarify and apply the regulations made under the legislation. For more information on Environment Protection Policies see the Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development Directorate 2017-2018 Annual Report. This Annual Report summarises the activities and performance of the EPA in 2017-2018. Environment Protection ACT 1997 Environmental Authorisations An EA, granted under section 49 of the Environment Protection Act, sets out the conditions under which activities with a significant potential to cause environmental harm may be conducted. The EPA issued 33 new EA's during 2017-2018. We currently administer a total of 286 EA's which are subject to review. Environmental Authorisations granted for an unlimited period are subject to a review at least every five years based on a risk assessment of the activity and authorisation holder. There were 78 reviews and 29 variations of EA's during 2017-18 (refer to Table 1). Table 1: Number of new Environmental Authorisations issued Activity (Schedule1 Class A) 2015 -16 2016 -17 2017 -18 Total 55 34 33 Environmental Protection Agreements Section 38 of the Environment Protection Act provides for the EPA to enter into Environmental Protection Agreements, instead of an EA, for certain activities that entail a moderately significant risk of environmental harm (those listed in Schedule 1 Class B of the Act). Environmental Protection Agreements are formal, non-binding agreements between the EPA and businesses which are designed to assist them manage their environmental performance. The term of Environmental Protection Agreements is generally three years. In 2017-2018, the EPA entered into 40 Environmental Protection Agreements, bringing the number of agreements currently administered by the EPA to 192 (refer to Table 2). There are 10 agreements for contaminated land which related to the requirement to implement on- going site management plans , primarily related to sites impacted by residual bonded asbestos. Table 2: Number of Environmental Protection Agreements issued per Activity Note: of the 192 agreements, 179 relate to builders and developers undertaking construction works on sites greater than 0.3 hectares.

During 2017-2018: the EPA received and endorsed 93 erosion and sediment control plans; and undertook 775 inspections of development sites greater than 0.3 hectares. Contaminated Land Notifications The EPA received 7 contaminated land notifications under section 23A of the Environment Protection Act 1997, during the reporting period. The notifications related to hydrocarbon impacts to soil and groundwater at the site. There have been 99 notifications since the contaminated land provisions were enacted in 1999. Contaminated Sites During 2017-2018: nine independent contaminated land audits into site suitability by EPA approved auditors were reviewed and endorsed by the EPA. These primarily related to the redevelopment of sites potentially impacted by hydrocarbon and asbestos contamination; 47 contaminated la nd environmental assessment reports into the suitability of sites for their proposed uses were reviewed and endorsed; and 760 inspections were carried out of known or potential contaminated sites to review whether activities were being conducted without ap propriate approval and whether redevelopment activities were underway or complete. Register of Contaminated Sites As of 30 June 2018, there are 173 contaminated sites recorded on the Register. The information contained on the Register is publicly available on the Access Canberra website and can be obtained by contacting the EPA. Contaminated Land Searches and Data The EPA maintains records of known, potentially contaminated and remediated land in the ACT. This information is made available through the Lease Conveyancing Enquiry through the ACT Planning and Land Authority and Contaminated Land Search through Access Canberra to ensure persons with an interest in the land have access to records held by the EPA. The information is also provided under agreement to utility providers, their contractors and other areas of the ACT Government for their operational requirements for installation and maintenance of infrastructure. During 2017-2018: the EPA entered into two agreements with directional boring operators; and received and responded to 542 contaminated Land Search enquiries. Beneficial reuse involves the reuse both on and off-site of soil which has a level of contamination but does not pose, subject to appropriate management, a risk to human health or the environment for a particular land use. The applications for reuse are undertaken by suitable qualified environmental consultants and are subject to rigorous assessment in accordance with the nationally adopted guidelines endorsed by the EPA. During 2017-2018, the EPA received, assessed and approved 75 applications for the beneficial reuse of approximately 356,991 cubic metres of low level contaminated soil. Planning and Development During 2017-2018, the EPA commented on 1,266 Development Applications and other planning documents referred from the Planning and Land Authority and the National Capital Authority. Controlled Waste Movements In 2017-18, 35 valid consignment authorisations were issued for the movement of a controlled waste into the ACT, primarily for clinical and asbestos waste from the surrounding regions and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) free oil from static electric transformers from other jurisdictions. During the same period, 955 controlled waste movements out of the ACT were notified and monitored by the EPA. Complaint Handling In 2017-2018 the EPA resolved two on-going complaints highlighted below: Southern State Waste Recycling's non-compliance with their EA. Since late 2015, this activity had been the source of complaints about dust, litter and noise from neighbouring business. As a result of ongoing non-compliance with the conditions in the EA, the activity ceased operation on 1 March 2018 and surrendered their EA on 16 May 2018; and ongoing complaints since July 2017, from residents about odour from the Mugga Lane precinct due to suspected emissions from landfilling activities at the Mugga Lane Resource Management Centre and Corkhill Bros Composting facility. EPA engaged with affected residents to identify the source, nature and frequency of the odour. No source was identified, however, the EPA engaged with Corkhill Bros who modified their composting process and reduced the amount of composted material stored on site. Remondis Australia Pty Ltd, the Territory contractor for the acceptance and disposal of waste at the site are operating under a varied authorisation with firmer management and monitoring requirements. There have been no complaints since 13 March 2018. On 1 July 2017, Access Canberra introduced a Complaints Management Team (CMT) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system to deal with all Access Canberra complaints, includi ng those for the EPA. Since 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2018, the CMT received 2,716 complaints related to EPA matters, of which 2,177 related to noise. The CMT referred 230 cases to the EPA for further action. 80% of complaints received by the CMT related to the EPA are about noise. Figure 1 provides a breakdown of the categories of EPA complaints receive by the CMT from 1 July 2017 to 31 June 2018. Erosion and Sediment Control Plans A condition of an Environmental Protection Agreements is the endorsement, by the EPA, of an erosion and sediment control plan prior to works commencing.

Figure 1: Categories of EPA complaints received by the Complaints Management Team Educational Activities As a regulator, we apply an engage, educate and enforce compliance model. Compliance is encouraged through engagement and education but escalating enforcement actions are applied to those whose conduct will, or is likely to, cause harm. We carry out both proactive and reactive activities aimed at improving environmental outcomes. Reactive monitoring relies on the community, business or industry reporting environmental concerns or events, such as pollution of our environment or illegal water use. Information and guidelines for industry and the general public in relation to the EP Act are available on the Access Canberra website. Information is also routinely shared through social media informing builders to ensure sediment controls are in place prior to commencing works and regularly maintained, particularly for major rain events. Enforcement Activities for breaches of the Environment Protection Act 1997 Individuals or businesses may incur penalties such as on-the-spot infringement notices, Environment Protection Orders or prosecution for breaches of the Environment Protection Act 1997 . On-the-spot infringement notices were issued for three minor breaches of the Act for excessive noise from music. In 2017-2018 the EPA served two Environment Protection Orders, one for excessive noise from an air conditioning system and one for the importation of soil onto land without an EA. One matter was referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions for non-payment of an on-the-spot infringement notice for noise. Operat ion Scrap In early May 2018, the ACT Government received several reports of food businesses illegally discharging waste water into the storm water system. The areas reported include Phillip, Dickson and Braddon. Under the Environment Protection Act 1997 it is an offence to pollute a waterway, including the storm water system. In response to reports received, officers from the Environment Protection Authority and Health Protection Service undertook a joint proactive education and compliance operation on 31 May 2018. The EPA issued warnings to three business for potential pollution of water related matters. The EPA has conducted follow -up inspections of the three premises and found no non -compliances. The operation focused on kitchen maintenance, cleaning fa cilities and areas at the rear of the food business, particularly around points of entry to the storm water. The EPA and HPS provided food businesses with information sheets to assist owners, managers and staff in complying with their general environmental duty to preventing pollutants generated by their activities from entering the environment. Operation Scrap resulted in 25 restaurants being inspected in Belconnen, Hawker, O'Connor, Manuka, Kingston, Civic, Braddon and Dickson. Offices found evidence of kitchen waste in the storm water sumps at the rear of three businesses. These businesses were provided with information and verbally warned to stop putting waste down the storm water system.

During 2017-2018, the EPA undertook 8 enforcement actions, which is similar to the past two years, as shown in Table 3. Table 3: Total number of Enforcement Actions taken under the Environment Protection Act Note: *This was a court imposed fine for a noise offence. Water Resources A ct 2007 The EPA administers the Water Resources Act, which aims to ensure the use and management of the Territory's water resources are sustainable while protecting the ecosystems that depend on the waterways. It is also designed to protect waterways and aquifers from damage. Water is considered a commodity (based on demands from irrigation and industrial use) with water entitlements being commonly traded in Australia, both within and between jurisdictions. However, demand for water trades in the ACT is low because we do not have large irrigation dams or large-scale irrigation businesses. During 2017-2018, there were three new water access entitlement issued in the ACT. Under the Water Resources Act, licences are issued for regulating potential harmful activities ranging from water abstraction, bore drilling and construction of dams or modification of waterways (rivers creeks and large stormwater drains).

Land Development activities, such as housing estates, involving realignment of creeks, construction of water quality ponds and earthworks would trigger the need for an Environmental Authorisation, sediment and erosion control plans, Environmental Protection Agreements and a Waterway W ork Licence. Amendments to the Water Resources Act 2007 reduced this licensing burden by allowing work approved by an Environmental Authorisation or Environmental Protection Agreement under the Environment Protection Act 1997, not to require an additional Waterway Work Licence. During 2017-2018: there were 185 active Licences to Take Water with two new licences issued and two cancelled; and four Waterway Works Licences were issued, a reduction from previous years indicating the effectiveness of the red tape reduction initiative. Table 4 indicates licensing activity by number of new licences and entitlements issued compared to previous years. Table 4: Number of Licences per type issued under the Water Resources Act 2007 Assessment of Water Use and Protection of Environmental Flows Water use by licence holders is assessed to ensure that extraction does not reach a level that negatively impacts our aquatic ecosystems and that users pay a reasonable price for using the resource. Only one licence holder exceeded their licence volume during 2017-2018. A warning letter was issued and notice of rectification works has been received in relation to the cause of overuse. Environmental water releases required from the water supply dams were compliant with the specifications set out licence conditions. Metering of Water Use All licenced water use in the ACT is metered. The EPA uses a risk assessment program for licence inspections, which results in each meter being inspected at least once every three years. The inspections performed for 2017- 2018 are listed in Table 6 and breakdown of the ACT meter fleet by capacity is shown in Figure 2. For transparency and to assist compliance, the ACT will continue to ensure that meters are identified using a unique serial number, most commonly located on the face of the meter. This is referred to as the meter number which is also kept on a customer's licence file. The information is publicly available upon request. In 2017-2018 there were 331 meters in use under 185 licences. EPA officers performed 47 licence inspections which included 71 meters.

During 2017-2018: the Molonglo Reach water ski area remained closed to the general public due to submerged and floating debris; there are currently four active licences issued under the Lakes Act for use of the Molonglo Reach water ski area. Two for use of the main basin area for training and competition purposes only and two for marine repair businesses to conduct testing; and three new powerboat licences were issued making a total of 14 powerboat licences to regulate the use of powerboats for specific purposes, such as training, hire boats, charter fishing, on ACT waterways. Enforcement Activities for breaches of the Lakes Act Licensees are regulated in accordance with the Access Canberra Environmental Compliance framework. Compliance is encouraged through engagement and education but escalating enforcement actions are applied to those whose conduct will, or is likely to, cause harm. This process can prevent serious harm to our water resources and avoid remediation actions. As in 2016 -2017, there were no enforcement actions for breaches of the Lakes Act in 2017- 2018.

Australian Government Commitments Air Quality The EPA produces an annual Air Quality Monitoring Report as part of its compliance with the Ambient Air Quality National Environment Protection Measure (NEPM). The Report must be submitted in an approved form to the National Environment Protection Council by 30 June each year. Under the Ambient Air Quality NEPM, the ACT monitors: carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, photochemical oxidants as ozone, and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.s). The Health Directorate conducts air quality monitoring in the ACT. The data, once validated, is then provided to the EPA for national and local reporting. Monitoring results in 2017 demonstrate that Canberra's air quality is generally good, with no exceedances of the NEPM standards for carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone and PM10 (coarse particulate matter). In 2017, the major impacts on Canberra's air quality came from the accumulation of combustion particles from wood heaters and hazard reduction burns. There were 13 days when particle matter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.s), or fine particulate matter, exceeded the daily standard between May and July, due to increased domestic wood heater emissions during the cold winter months. While PM2.s and PM10 levels were above the daily reporting standards at Civic on 30 August 2017 due to hazard reduction burns, they are not counted as non-compliant events in accordance with the exceptional event rule under section 3(C} of the NEPM. For many years the ACT Government has actively worked on addressing the domestic wood heater emissions. The ACT Government has continued with the regulation of the sale or supply of firewood, wood heater replacement program and numerous public awareness campaigns such as 'Burn Right Tonight'.

During 2017-2018: the Molonglo Reach water ski area remained closed to the general public due to submerged and floating debris; there are currently four active licences issued under the Lakes Act for use of the Molonglo Reach water ski area. Two for use of the main basin area for training and competition purposes only and two for marine repair businesses to conduct testing; and three new powerboat licences were issued making a total of 14 powerboat licences to regulate the use of powerboats for specific purposes, such as training, hire boats, charter fishing, on ACT waterways.

National Pollutant Inventory The National Pollutant Inventory (NPI) is a joint program between the Australian Government and all participating states and territories. The legislative framework underpinning the NPI is the NPI NEPM, which was originally made in 1998, and varied in November 2008. Section 159A of the ACT's Environment Protection Act 1997 establishes reporting requirements for industrial facilities in the ACT. During 2017-2018, the EPA received, validated and approved 21 industry reports for the reporting year 2016- 2017 (please note that NPI reporting is a year in arrears due to reporting deadlines). In 2016, the National Environment Protection Council agreed to terms of reference for an independent review of the NPI. The Review process is overseen by a steering committee of senior officials from the Australian, state and territory jurisdictions. The Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development Directorate is the ACT representative on the Steering Committee, supported by the EPA. As the Review will have a significant effect on the future operations of the NPI, the review outcomes will be of interest to stakeholders from government, industry, non-government organisations and the public who use data from and/or contribute data to, the NPI. The Review of the National Pollutant Inventory Discussion Paper was released to the public for submission from 2 July 2018 to 10 August 2018 via http://www.npi.gov.au/ . Murray Darling Basin Compliance Arrangements Following investigations and revelations into water theft and poor governance arrangements in the Murray Darling Basin, the Murray Darling Basin Authority, the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments have reinforced their commitment to work together for a unified approach to compliance across the Basin. This includes agreeing to a Compliance Compact which contains a schedule of improvement actions for each state and territory, including responsibilities and an agreed Action Plan to enforce the rules of the water use. Significantly the compliance compact seeks to adopt a 'No meter, no pump' policy' and specify the minimum standard for water meters across the Murray Darling Basin. To meet this requirement, a ll ACT licences have conditions mandating the installation of a meter that meets the standard as well as requiring maintenance and data reporting. The ACT EPA Water Meter Installation, Maintenance and Replacement Guideline aligns with the compliance compac t.

The Scheme covers pedestrians, cyclists, motor bikes and motor vehicles so long as there is at least one registrable vehicle involved in a motor accident that occurs on or after 1 July 2014, regardless of where fault is attributable for the accident. As a result, it extends motor vehicle accident coverage for catastrophic injuries beyond what was previously available under Compulsory-third Party (CTP) Insurance to include those persons who may be considered to be at-fault, or someone who is involved in a single vehicle accident, or even a blameless accident. The Scheme applies to catastrophic private sector work injuries that occur from 1 July 2016. An injured worker who is a lifetime participant of the LTCS Scheme no longer claims under the Workers Compensation Act 1951 for lifetime treatment and care needs covered by the LTCSS. As it is a no-fault scheme, the LTCSS reduces the stress on those injured and their families that has previously been associated with litigating claims to meet ongoing treatment costs. It ensures early access to medical and rehabilitation care. Further, as treatment and care is on-going, those injured no longer have to worry whether a lump sum payment will meet their needs for the rest of their life and whether they will receive the ongoing treatment and care they require. Examples of treatment and care provided to participants in the Scheme include: medical treatment; rehabilitation; attendant care services; and home and transport modification. For motor accident injuries, the LTCSS is funded by a levy on CTP insurance policies. Private sector work injuries are fully funded through a separate levy collected from workers compensation insurers and self-insurers. The financial operations of the LTCSS are reflected in the LTCS Fund which is a separate financial reporting entity. The LTCS Act is administered by the Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate (CMTEDD). Under section 10 of the LTCS Act, the Minister must appoint a public servant as the LTCS Commissioner of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). The Executive Director of the Economic and Financial Group, CMTEDD was appointed by the Minister as the LTCS Commissioner commencing 13 May 2016. The functions of the LTCS Commissioner are supported by the Financial Framework Management and Insurance Branch of the Economic and Financial Group, within CMTEDD. The NSW government provides support for the ACT Scheme. The formal transfer of administration of the ACT Scheme to the NSW LTCS Authority occurred with effect from 1 September 2015. This fully gives effect to the IGA signed by the ACT Government in February 2015 with NSW, which enabled the LTCSA to provide co-ordinated lifetime care and support services on behalf of the LTCS Commissioner to participants in the ACT Scheme B.1.1 LTCS Commissioner Responsibilities Under the provisions of the LTCS Act, some of the key responsibilities of the LTCS Commissioner are to: determine the LTCS levy amou nt; issue and monitor guidelines for the LTCSS; assess applications for eligibility for Scheme participation; assess reasonable and necessary treatment and care needs of participants; and pay assessed treatment and care needs. B.1.2 Highlights The key priorities for the LTCS Commissioner during the 2017-18 financial year were to: administer the LTCSS in accordance with the requirements of the LTCS Act and Guidelines; monitor how the Scheme is operating, including whether it is meeting participant expectati ons; continue to improve guidelines and procedures for the efficient and effective delivery of the LTCSS in consultation with our administration partners - the NSW Lifetime Care and Support Authority (NSW LTCSA); develop a memorandum of understanding with the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) for the exchange of information about LTCS treatment and care expenses of LTCS scheme participants; and undertake investments in accordance with the Fund's investment strategy. Against these priorities, the LTCS Commissioner: determined, having regard to independent actuarial advice, the LTCS levy for motor vehicles and the LTCS levy for work injuries in 2018- 19; commissioned and received the third LTCS participant feedback report on the administration and effectiveness of the Scheme services provided to participants, including recommendations on ways service delivery may be enhanced; provided input into the review of LTCS guidelines undertaken by the ACT's administration partner, the NSW LTCSA, given the AC T's guidelines largely mirror the guidelines of the NSW LTCS Scheme; liaised with the National Disability Insurance Authority on a Memorandum of Understanding for the sharing of information between the LTCS Commissioner and the NDIA; and invested an additional $15 million of funds not required in the short-term in accordance with the approved LTCSS investment strategy. The investment portfolio achieved an investment return for the 2017-18 financial year of 6.33%.

The investment portfolio achieved an investment return for the 2017-18 financial year of 6.33%. B.1.3 Our Participants Applications to the Scheme The LTCS Commissioner accepted one motor accident injury applicant as an interim participant in the Scheme during 2017- 18. Another applicant was accepted as an interim participant on 8 August 2018 following determination by an independent review pane l. The Commissioner had declined the motor accident injury application in 2017-18 on the grounds that it did not meet the eligibility criteria for entry into the Scheme . The claimant disputed the Commissioner's decision, and in accordance with Part 7 of the LTCS Act, the Commissioner referred the dispute for assessment by an independent review panel. The LTCS Commissioner received one new work injury application in the 2017-18 financial year for participation in the Scheme - the first work injury claim since the LTCS Scheme was extended to cover work injuries with effect from 1 July 2016. The applicant was accepted as an interim participant in the Scheme. As at 30 June 2018, there are no outstanding applications to the Scheme for assessment. Applying to the Scheme \"All participants commence as 'interim participants' for up to two years. During this time, the Scheme will pay for any reasonable and necessary treatment, rehabilitation and care related to the motor accident or work injury. After two years, an interim participant may be eligible to become a 'lifetime participant'. Children do not apply for lifetime eligibility until they are at least five years old.\" Decisions about whether an interim participant is accepted as a lifetime participant are made before the end of the interim participation period. Around six months prior to the end of the interim participation period, a participant's eligibility to remain in the Scheme is assessed to determine whether the person may have sufficiently recovered to the extent that they no longer meet the eligibility criteria after the two year period. If it is assessed that the injured person is likely to meet the eligibility criteria beyond two years, the person is accepted into the Scheme for life. During 2017-18, no interim participants were assessed for lifetime participation in the LTCS Scheme. Participant profile As at 30 June 2018 there are eight participants who are receiving co-ordinated treatment and care benefits through the Scheme. Of the eight participants in the Scheme, four are lifetime participants and four are interim participants. The LTCSS continues to have quite a young age demographic with the average age of participants currently 27 years of age. Of the eight participants in the Scheme as at 30 June 2018, only one participant is under ten years of age. The Scheme covers five types of catastrophic injuries - traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, amputations, burns and vision loss. Six participants (75 %) have suffered a traumatic brain injury. In terms of how Scheme participants were injured, the participant under ten years of age was a passenger in a motor vehicle accident that caused her injuries. Three of the participants were injured as pedestrians in accidents involving a motor vehicle and one participant was injured while riding a bicycle. For the three drivers injured in motor vehicle accidents, two were motorcycle riders.

Participants' perception of the LTCS Scheme support for recovery and rehabilitation goals Feedback from participants and their nominated persons in a Participant Feedback Research conducted in May 2018 8 continues to be very positive about the existence of the scheme. Some of the comments from participants and their nominated persons of the Scheme include: All interviewed participants and/or their nominated persons reflected that the Scheme substantially meets participant needs at their individual stage of recovery and rehabilitation and assists them in meeting their goals. 8 Dr Sandra Rickards ACT LTCS Participant Feedback Research 2018 - Research Report \"I can see the business case for the Scheme, but that is implemented in a way that is treating people like human beings ... that is really impressive.\" \"It is an exceptional Scheme and I can't begin to think what it would have been like if it didn't exist. Its so catstrophic it is not worth thinking about.\" \"The level of support that the whole Scheme offers. They can really help you\". \"A huge strength of the Scheme is that it is not a cookie -cutter Scheme, they really do look at the needs of this person, and it was so collaborative....\" \"I know I've set out some suggestions ... but I hope you understand that we think the Scheme is exceptional. It shows the strength of the team and the strength of the Scheme that it is so flexible and responsive to the needs of the person. \" Provided Treatment, Rehabilitation and Care In 2017-18, the LTCS Commissioner spent a total of $772,105 on services for participants. As expected, given there were two new participants accepted in the year, hospital expenses accounted for the largest expenditure category (42%) of participant expenses. The second highest expense category related to support services (20%), which comprises mainly case management fees and travel expenses for participants and service providers to access/provide medical review and treatment. Rehabilitation (15%) and equipment (13%) were the next largest expense categories. In comparison, in 2016-17, the LTCS Commissioner spent a total of $472,447 on services for participants. The largest expenditure categories in 20 16-17 were for rehabilitation (25%) and support services (23%), reflecting the recovery and rehabilitation needs of those participants who had been in the Scheme for two or more years. Accessing Services - How the scheme works with participants \"The LTCS Scheme provides reasonable and necessary treatment, rehabilitation and care as it is required throughout the person's life and assists them to plan their rehabilitation and care services. Participants are supported as needed by a LTCSS coordinator. The coordinator arranges for a case manager to help plan services required by the participant. The case manager will work with the participant and their service providers to request approval for services. Services are organised as required and the participant and their families are closely involved in each of these requests. Usually payment of approved treatment and care needs is made by the LTCSS directly to the supplier of the services. \" In the participant research undertaken in May 2018, participants were asked about their experiences accessing and using services and equipment, and if there had been any issues with these. Overall, participants were very positive about both the services and equipment funded by LTCS.

B.1.4 Outlook Strategic priorities in 2018-19 for the LTCS Commissioner include: administer the LTCSS in accordance with the requirements of the LTCS Act and Guidelines; collect annual feedback from participants on their expectations and experience with the LTCSS and in consultation with our administration partner, the NSW LTCSA, implement improvements to the way LTCS scheme benefits are delivered to ACT participants; implement changes t o improve the ACT LTCS Guidelines following on from the review of LTCS Guidelines by NSW LTCSA; finalise the development of a memorandum of understanding with the National Disability Insurance Agency for the exchange of information about LTCS treatment an d care expenses of LTCS Scheme participants; and undertake investments in accordance with the Fund's investment strategy. B.2 Performance analysis The LTCSS' 2017 -18 performance indicators are included in the Budget Portfolio Statements for the LTCS Fund, and are reported as part of the LTCS Fund's Statement of Performance. The LTCS Fund achieved all its accountability targets in 2017-18, with the exception of its investment earning rate. Explanation of Performance Indicators a. Independent actuarial review to advise on the required fund contribution The LTCS levies are crucial to the funding of the Scheme, with a levy applying to all CTP policies payable at the time of vehicle registration and a levy applied to private sector workers' compensation insurers. As required by the LTCS Act, the levies are set by the LTCS Commissioner based on independent actuarial advice. The level at which the levies are set in any given year is intended to secure sufficient funds to meet the costs of all estimated present and future liabilities of new participants of the LTCSS in that year. The LTCS levies are for a financial year and are set in May/June before the commencement of a financial year on 1 July. In accordance with section 83 of the LTCS Act, the LTCS Commissioner obtained before the beginning of the contribution period, a report from an independent actuary in relation to the amounts needed to be contributed to the LTCS fund for the contribution period. Two actuarial reports for the 2018-19 contribution period were undertaken by Finity for the purposes of setting the 2018-19 LTCS Levy for motor vehicle injuries and the LTCS levy for work injuries. The final actuarial reports were received in March 2018. \" I would have missed out on surgeries and physiotherapy if it didn't exist. I would be a lot worse off.\" b. Determine LTCS Levies The LTCS Commissioner determined that the LTCS levy for a twelve-month CTP policy would be increased to $36.50 in 2018-19 (previously $35.00 in 2017-18) for all vehicles except those that are subject to distance restrictions applicable as part of the ACT's Concessional Vintage Vehicle Registration (CVVR) Scheme. As a result of the increase to the LTCS levy for general passenger vehicles, the LTCS Levy determined for the CVVR Scheme has increased to $7.30 in 2018-19 (from $7.00 in 2017-18) for a twelve-month CTP policy . The Levy determination for the 2018-19 contribution period for both motor vehicles and private sector workers compensation insurers and self-insurers, was notified on the Legislation Register on 11 May 2018. The LTCS Commissioner has determined these LTCS levies based on the best available data. As the Scheme will only be in its fifth year of operation for motor vehicle accidents and in its third year of operation for work accidents, a high degree of uncertainty still remains with respect to the number of participants and the costs of providing services. By the very nature of the injury type covered by the Scheme, the experience can be expected to be volatile from year to year. Noting that it will take many years of experience before more robust scheme data becomes available, the LTCS Commissioner will continue to reassess the levy amounts yearly, on the basis of updated advice provided by an independent actuary. c. Undertake an annual participant feedback process A survey of the LTCSS participants was conducted by Modd Research and Evaluation Pty Ltd in May 2018 with a final report received in June 2018. The survey was conducted by a social research consultant who specialises in undertaking research of services in the disability and health sectors. The purpose of the survey was to seek feedback from selected LTCSS participants and their nominated representatives to understand their perceptions and experience with the LTCSS and whether the Scheme continues to support them at the particular stage in their recovery and rehabilitation. Analysis based on the feedback was used to identify opportunities for improvements in the operation of the LTCSS and to ensure that the Scheme's focus remains on rehabilitation and recovery outcomes. All LTCSS participants invited to participate agreed to be interviewed as part of the survey. Overall the research reported that respondents gave very positive feedback on the extent and manner in which the Scheme supports the rehabilitation and ongoing well-being of participants. The Scheme continues to mee t participants' needs at their individual stage of recovery and rehabilitation and to assist them in meeting those goals. All participants and their families interviewed reported that they felt well- supported by their case manager and the Scheme's coordina tor care team. Within this positive context, participants also suggested improvements. These point to opportunities for refining operational processes around the inclusion of information or other means of engagement to: promote more open lines of communication between the case manager and LTCS care team or between the care team and the participant; and support greater participant independence, choice and control in their treatment and care where appropriate.

As the results of the research relate to the administrative processes of the LTCSA (the ACT's partner in administering LTCSS benefits to ACT participants), a copy of the research report and findings has been provided to the LTCSA and the findings have been discussed with them. d Difference between the investment earning rate and the benchmark is = 0 In 2017-18, the LTCS investment return has been less than the benchmark due to the current small size of the fund's total investment relative to the size of each investment. This means there is curren tly a material impact on the fund's annual returns from the transaction costs payable each time funds are invested. This is likely to persist for some years until the fund reaches a certain size and maturity relative to the size of the new investments being made in a given year. The same indicator has been retained in 2018- 19 as the LTCSS invests in a passive fund (it largely matches the companies included in the market indices) and it is hence unlikely to exceed the benchmark return performance. B.3 Scrutiny During the reporting period the LTCSS did not participate in any Legislative Assembly Committee inquiries related to its activities. There were no Ombudsman Reports. However, the Auditor-General Report No.1 of 2018: ACT Government Strategic and Accountability Indicators made a number of recommendations that were relevant for the Lifetime Care and Support Fund. In regard to: Recommendation 2 (a), the Lifetime Care and Support Fund has been requested to amend accountability indicators to explain how they support achievement of government priorities; and Recommendation 4, all Territory entities, including the Lifetime Care and Support Fund, have been requested to document their procedure for the review, selection and approval of strategic and accountability indicators. The amendment of accountability indicators [recommendation 2 (a)] and the documentation of procedures for the review, selection and approval of strategic and accountability indicators (recommendation 4) will be reviewed in line with updated guidance material once it has been released. B.4 Risk Management The LTCSS is part of CMTEDD. As such, it is covered in CMTEDD's risk management arrangements. B.5 Internal Audit The LTCSS is part of the CMTEDD Audit and Risk Committee. CMTEDD's Annual Report section on the Internal Audit Committee applies to the LTCSS. No internal audits of the LTCSS were undertaken during 2017- 18. B.6 Fraud Prevention The LTCSS is part of CMTED D. As such, it is covered in CMTEDD's Fraud and Corruption Prevention Plan. B.7 W orkplace Health and Safety The LTCSS is part of CMTEDD.

C.3 Capital Works The LTCS Commissioner did not undertake any Capital Works Projects in the 2017- 18 financial year. C.4 Asset Management The LTCS Commissioner has no intangible assets. C.5 Government Contracting The LTCS Commissioner did not have any contracts which value exceeds $25,000 signed in 2017- 18. Further Information can be obtained from Sue Vroombout Lifetime Care and Support Commissioner Economic and Financial Group + 61 2 6205 3216 Sue.Vroombout@act.gov.au As the results of the research relate to the administrative processes of the LTCSA (the ACT's partner in administering LTCSS benefits to ACT participants), a copy of the research report and findings has been provided to the LTCSA and the findings have been discussed with them. d Difference between the investment earning rate and the benchmark is = 0 In 2017-18, the LTCS investment return has been less than the benchmark due to the current small size of the fund's total investment relative to the size of each investment. This means there is curren tly a material impact on the fund's annual returns from the transaction costs payable each time funds are invested. This is likely to persist for some years until the fund reaches a certain size and maturity relative to the size of the new investments being made in a given year. The same indicator has been retained in 2018- 19 as the LTCSS invests in a passive fund (it largely matches the companies included in the market indices) and it is hence unlikely to exceed the benchmark return performance.
