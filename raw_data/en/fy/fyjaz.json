Shamanic energy medicine is a dynamic approach to energetic healing that calls on the myriad relationships with the unseen world to offer healing to the whole person. The ultimate goal is to assist clients in coming into right relationship with themselves and the world around them through time-proven methods that enable us to be more ourselves as we move into the future, together. What is a session like? Sessions will vary depending on the client's goals. We may work with sacred objects, shamanic journeying, or a combination of healing modalities. Our healing methods and tools are rooted in cross-cultural shamanic traditions with thousands of years of wisdom. Our practice is informed by the Pachakuti Mesa Tradition, Plant Spirit Medicine, Five Element Acupuncture, South African Sangoma, and Huichol Lineages.

A Shaman, also known as a Curandero (and many other names depending on the culture), is one who develops a personal and intimate relationship with the unseen world for the purpose of being of service as a healer. This relationship is cultivated experientially through self-induced altered states of consciousness, ritual ceremony, and refined energetic awareness. Shamanism is not a religion. It is a spiritual practice grounded in a reverent awareness that the world is animated, conscious, and energetically interdependent. Guiding Principles: 1. EVERYTHING IS ALIVE (animation/vitalism). Everything manifests a physical form from the same animated essence. The shaman attends to this essence. 2. EVERYTHING IS CONSCIOUS (vigilance/observation). Everything watches us. The world is mirrored within us. The shaman learns to be a visionary observer. 3. EVERYTHING IS INTERCONNECTED (relationship/reciprocity). Everything responds to and is in interdependent relationship to everything else. The shaman is a mediator of these interconnections and interdependent relationships. 4. EVERYTHING TRANSFORMS (movement/change). Matter is the dense form of spirit. Spirit is the subtle form of matter. Everything is in vibrational flux. The shaman is an agent of change. 5. EVERYTHING RESPONDS TO FOCUSED INTENTION (mindful attention.) Proper intention and purity of motive are indispensable for all heartfelt shamanic practice. The shaman must thoroughly know him or herself in order to help others. The shaman's task is to come into right relationship and reverent communion with the seen and unseen world so as to mediate between worlds on behalf of the community. "}
