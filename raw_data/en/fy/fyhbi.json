We struggled for two years trying to get my son diagnosed, treated holistically and supported by his school for his underlying conditions. With her expertise, remedies and homeopathic suggestions, we were able to nearly resolve my son's anxiety, adhd, tics, chemical imbalance, asthma and allergies in just a couple of months. Not only that, but Cindy helped my husband when he ramped down on his meds and he was able to switch to homeopathy completely. I am proud to say our entire family is now med-free, we're finally feeling healed and the healthiest we've ever been. Cindy has both personal and professional experience working with kids and she is incredible when she works with my son. Thank you so much, Cindy! - 12/2/2021 I can't thank Cindy enough for what she does! She is so knowledgeable about everything thing homeopathy and has provided me with such great remedies and mental healing techniques. - 12/19/2020Updated review In our house Cindy is simply called \"the little angel\". My husband and sons came up with that years ago when she pulled out her formidable and varied bag of tricks to work our health issues. From the homeopathic remedies, nutritional counseling, mental de-stress techniques, energy work, and your loving straight talk coupled with your vast medical knowledge, I can only say the adage \"dynamite comes in small packages\" could not be more true. Without doubt she had added years to my life, but more importantly she has added quality to my days.10/20/2013Previous review I first went to see Cindy when I was diagnosed with cancer and getting ready for chemotherapy. Her homeopathic remedies and nutritional support helped me not only deal with some of the side effects of chemo but also helped me rebuild my body and spirit once I was done with chemo. Her energy and understanding of the human body is amazing. Cindy has an incredible bag of tricks and a weatlh of knowledge for dealing with the whole person. I cannot recommend her highly enough. My entire family now sees her and In our home she is referred to as the \"little angel\". - 10/7/2017 I met Cindy Sanders in 2007 when I was done with chemo,I'm a 10 years breast cancer survivor. I was so tired, physically and mentally, I knew I needed someone to help me to get back to work. I found Cindy's homepage and I called her. We made an appointment and I started my way to recovered. Cindy helped me, everything she gave me was prepared and only for me. Now that I retired, Cindy is helping me to cope with this new chapter in my life. Cindy is a great professional, great listener and a caring person, I'm very happy to continue my homeopathic treatment with her. - 4/24/2015 Don't search anywhere else - Cindy is THE BEST!!! I have never felt more understood by anyone else I have ever gone to about health issues. Cindy really listens and cares more than any other person I have seen to help resolve issues. Read more below... I'm a type-A, driven person who has created unnecessary stress and anxiety in life. I've had hives on and off and blamed it on food, so I tried many different diets and cleanses over the years. None worked in entirety. After doing a cleanse that was too abrasive on my system, I ended up with digestive issues - plus a whole lot more stress and anxiety on top of that! I believe in natural approaches to healing, and even more so because my body is extremely sensitive to medications. I didn't know much about homeopathy, but decided to give it a try. From my initial conversation with Cindy, I knew I was on the right path to a balanced state of mind, body and spirit. For the first time in my life I felt understood - she really got my frustration and what I've been through. Homeopathy is about treating the root cause of an illness, instead of putting a band-aid on the symptoms. It is not a 'cookie-cutter' approach to health. Homeopathy involves individual assessments. Two individuals with the same symptoms may receive entirely different treatments. My initial intake session at Homeopathic Balance lasted two hours. Cindy asked questions and really got to know me so she could recommend specific homeopathic remedies and supplements. I could sense her confidence in developing a plan of action to improve my health. Cindy is an incredible listener and has a genuine desire to help others heal. She really cares - it has been evident in all of our interactions. Ever since I committed to working with Cindy, my life shifted. My hives subsided, my digestion improved, and I regained a long lost sense of peace, confidence, and freedom. I feel closer to my family. I handle stress in a calm way and my sugar cravings have significantly declined. One of the best decisions in my life was making that first appointment with Cindy at Homeopathic Balance. Cindy's care has had a tremendous impact on my overall health and well-being. Even though I moved across the country, I am thrilled that I can still have phone sessions with Cindy if I need them! Give Cindy a call - the service she provides is priceless! - 8/4/2016 Cindy is an amazing woman and a gifted practitioner. She is gifted in many ways but her ability to assess your physical state as well as your frame of mind in a sweet, compassionate and effective manner is nothing short of amazing. Cindy is a confident and masterful homeopathic practitioner, but she utilizes additional modalities, as well. Cindy has taken care of my family through life's challenges for years now; physical, emotional, and spiritual. When my physical health was rocked so hard I did not think I would ever be able to come back, Cindy helped me. When my anxiety soared beyond my ability to manage it, Cindy helped me. When my heart was broken by sudden loss, and I could not face the world, Cindy literally saved me. I can never thank her enough. You will not regret this call, just call. - 10/7/2013First to Review Cindy Sanders is truly an amazing healer! She takes the time to help you find the causes of health issues so that they can actually be corrected, not just cover up symptoms like most medical practices. All of her treatments are completely natural and have ZERO side effects so you will actually feel and more importantly BE healthy. This is the place to go when you feel like you have tried everything. Take my advice, don't wait and try other things, go see Cindy first. - 10/8/2013 We took our daughter to see Cindy years ago. I just saw that she is now on Yelp. Cindy is the ultimate listener. She tries to understand the root of the problem, and confirms what she hears. The energy is always positive with Cindy. She recommended homeopathic \"medications\" so my daughter's aliments went away. I would definitely recommend Cindy! - 10/31/2013 Cindy is an amazing Homeopath!!! She is very compassionate and truly wants to assist in healing whether it is physically, mentally, or emotionally. She not only treats with homeopathy, but she also is very knowledgeable with other forms of nutrition and supplements. She is a wonderful support to our entire family of six and has helped us heal from more things you could ever imagine. My five year old son has autism and I am most thankful for the remarkable healing she has blessed him with through the years. She has been a \"miracle\" in our family and can't imagine life without her! Yes, yes, yes, I definitely recommend Cindy!
