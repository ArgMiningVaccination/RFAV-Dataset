Then he lost his ability to walk. A man in Australia lost his ability to walk after taking too many vitamin B6 supplements. The man had been taking 70 times the recommended dose, according to ABC Radio Melbourne. Vitamin B6 toxicity is rare. Some patients can regain the ability to walk when they stop taking it. When it comes to vitamins, more does not necessarily mean better. A man in Australia lost his ability to walk after consuming 70 times the recommended daily dose of vitamin B6, [ABC Radio Melbourne](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-08-05/vitamin-b-toxicity-peripheral-neuropath-deficiency-b6/101296070) reported. The 86-year-old man had previously been active and lived independently, his daughter Alison Taylor told ABC Radio, until a blood test revealed he had a slight deficiency in vitamin B6. Taylor said her father didn't have any symptoms of poor health, but his doctor prescribed a 50-milligram vitamin B6 supplement to up his levels. [Vitamin B6](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/vitamin-b6-benefits?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com), like other B vitamins, helps the body convert food into energy by breaking down carbs and protein. Research suggests it can help the body's immune system and certain brain functions. But 50 milligrams is much higher than the standard dose recommendation in both Australia and the US, which is [1.7 milligrams](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB6-HealthProfessional/) of vitamin B6 per day for men over 50. In fact, most people should get enough B6 through eating standard foods like chicken, potatoes, or even spaghetti sauce. The new, high-dose multivitamin wasn't the only B6 in the man's diet: He was also taking a magnesium supplement, which contained B6, and ate breakfast cereals fortified with B6. Within months, he started losing the feeling in his legs and eventually went to the hospital after he could no longer walk, Taylor told ABC Radio. \"Twelve months ago he was driving. He's now in aged care and in a wheelchair,\" Taylor, who did not share her father's name, said.
