It is also a manifestation of the realization that plant energies are compassionate: connecting deep within us. Their life force energies invite our bodies and consciousness to harmonize our energies with them, entering us into healing flow. Their very presence invites and facilitates our deepening of inner sensitivity: fine tuning into delicacy. We grow medicinal, useful, and Light energy producing plants from diverse cultures, and offer them to the local San Francisco Bay Area, where these plants can also be successfully grown. "}
