Naturopathy can treat the following hormonal imbalances: Irregular cycles (short or long), heavy bleeding, intense pain/cramps, bloating, clots. Naturopathy is very good at balancing menstrual cycles. First we determine the cause/s of the dysfunction, and then we correct it through a tailored treatment plan. PCOS is a hormonal condition. It is caused by excess male hormones and irregular ovulation. Polycystic ovaries and PCOS don't usually cause pain. Symptoms of PCOS: facial hair, acne, hair loss, weight gain, possibly heavy periods, possibly long bleeds, bleeding between periods, infertility. Endometriosis is not a hormonal condition, it is an inflammatory disease. Endometriosis is affected by hormone imbalance, but not caused by hormone imbalance. It is a disease that causes lesions and ovarian cysts/endometrioma. Oestrogen dominance refers to having too much oestrogen, but it also points to progesterone deficiency. Oestrogen Dominance is one of the main causes of low progesterone. Progesterone is needed to keep oestrogen levels in check. We can test for insulin resistance and pre-diabetes, and both of these conditions can be treated naturally with herbal medicine and nutritional medicine. We can treat both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism naturally. Women with untreated thyroid dysfunction are more at risk for having period problems too. In the case of prolonged stress, when cortisol levels are elevated for prolonged periods, it can throw other hormones off balance and may cause significant health problems. PMS is characterised by recurring somatic and psychological symptoms during the luteal phase of the cycle that are relieved within a few days of menstruation. Symptoms of PMS can include bloating, acne, anxiety, fatigue, irritability, food cravings, an increased appetite and many more. Declining oestrogen levels are associated with many health disorders. With dietary and lifestyle modifications, we can reduce the likelihood of developing chronic health disease in the post-menopausal period, as well as reduce severity of menopausal symptoms.
